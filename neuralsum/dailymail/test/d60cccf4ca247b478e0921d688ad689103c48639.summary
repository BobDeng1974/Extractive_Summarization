@entity0 tonight insisted he would not give up trying to pull @entity1 out of the @entity2 even if voters rejected leaving in a referendum			1
the @entity6 leader said he would accept the result and rejected claims his party would become ' redundant ' as a result			1
mr @entity0 , appearing on a special @entity12 - style programme filmed in @entity13 today , even claimed the party could enjoy an @entity16 - style surge in support in the wake of a vote to remain in the @entity2			1
all three leaders faced questions over mr @entity30 's proposed @entity39 referendum in 2017			1
the prime minister revealed that he would not go into any future coalition which refused to grant the public a say on @entity1 's membership of the @entity2			1
mr @entity31 however batted off criticism from the audience to insist that he would not hold a referendum – insisting it was not in @entity1 's interests			1
speaking tonight , mr @entity0 claimed @entity1 could thrive outside the @entity2 and vowed to push for a referendum before 2017			1
he said : ' the point about a referendum is we 've had a variety of promises of referendums that have never been delivered			2
' i want that referendum conducted on full , free and fair terms			2
and what i mean by that is that both sides must have the same spending limits			0
the broadcasters must have an ombudsman to make sure there is a proper , even debate and we must - and we must define who is qualified to vote in this referendum and who is n't			2
' and if it 's a full , free and fair referendum i will accept the result			1
would it make @entity6 redundant ? no , because just look at what 's happened in @entity75			1
the @entity75 – the @entity75 rejected their independence referendum and yet the @entity16 have gone to remarkable heights since then			2
' the @entity6 leader faced questions from a live audience for the show , hosted by the presenter @entity82 , broadcast tonight the show was broadcast after @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 faced a live - tv grilling over their plans for the next five years in power mr @entity0 's claim that @entity6 could surge to similar levels of support to the @entity16 is likely to spark accusations of hubris			1
in the wake of last year 's independence referendum in @entity75 , the @entity16 has seen its support surge to 54 per cent – putting it on course , according to some analysts , to win all 59 seats north of the border			2
@entity6 meanwhile trail badly behind both the @entity99 and @entity100 – currently languishing on between 10 - 15 per cent in the polls			2
unlike the @entity16 , the party is expected to win no more than five seats on may 7 – with some pollsters predicting only the popular @entity105 clinging onto his seat in @entity107 , @entity108			0
but mr @entity0 insisted @entity6 was on course to do well at the election and claimed the party 's stance on border controls was backed by the vast majority of the country			1
he said : ' 77 per cent of @entity1 people want us to have proper border controls and reduced immigration levels , all right ? i am pro immigration , but i 'm pro controlled immigration			0
' during the earlier tv showdown mr @entity30 guaranteed that he would not go into government with any party that would not give the public an in - out referendum @entity31 , appearing on the @entity12 special tonight , insisted he would not give voters a say on @entity39 mr @entity0 said @entity6 could save ' easily £ 1bn a year ' from @entity131 health tourism and returned to the controversial topic of foreign @entity134 sufferers receiving treatment on the @entity131			1
he said : ' the issue i specifically raised was the issue that since 2012 anybody can come to @entity1 , not to live , but anybody can come to @entity1 and get @entity134 treatment on the @entity131			0
' now it 's interesting			0
i have here a letter from a 30 year old hiv positive man in @entity144 who says , why are the waiting rooms now full to overflowing ? why does it now take me three weeks to get an appointment ? ' and he says to me , it is because since we opened the door in 2012 we 're now incapable of providing @entity134 treatment for people legally living in @entity1			0
' mr @entity0 , facing tough questions from the studio audience , insisted @entity1 would not be damaged by leaving the @entity2			1
he said : ' we 're not exiting @entity39			0
let 's be very clear about that			0
i love @entity39 , it 's a wonderful place			0
it 's got different countries , different people , different languages , cultures , wines , cheeses , it 's a great place			0
' and providing it 's democratic and not fighting each other it is , i think in many ways the richest , culturally the richest continent on @entity173			0
' however , what now masquerades as being @entity39 , what has hijacked the word @entity39 , is something called the @entity2 which has a flag , it has an anthem , it has a president – not that anyone can ever name who they are – and it is a political union that now makes nearly 75 % of our laws , costs us a great deal of money and i think is wholly unnecessary , not just for @entity1 , but i feel that for the rest of @entity39 too			2
@entity191 faced questions from a studio audience at @entity194 in @entity195 this evening the @entity75 first minister insisted she would block a @entity100 budget if mr @entity31 would not compromise with her the @entity6 leader also backtracked on comments praising the @entity201 leader @entity200 – admitting that he was ' probably ' a threat to the @entity1			1
' mr @entity200 who is clearly acting aggressively			0
i think he is a threat to us			0
i think there is also a threat from some of the extreme @entity209 elements in the @entity210 and it 's back to the question about defence			0

@entity6 leader said he would accept the result of any future @entity2 referendum
rejected claim @entity6 would become ' redundant ' if the country voted to stay
insisted a lost referendum would not deter him from trying to pull out of @entity2
mr @entity0 was interviewed for a special @entity12 - style programme
comes after @entity30 , @entity32 and @entity31 faced questions on live tv
