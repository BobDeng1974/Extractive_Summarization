@entity1 winger @entity0 will head back to the club for pre-season determined to break into the first - team fold as the @entity6 era dawns at @entity7			2
@entity8 is yet to be informed whether he will be a part of @entity1 ’s pre-season tour of the @entity11 but he is hopeful that he will be included in the group as the club head across the @entity14 to warm up for the new season with matches against @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
he is expected to learn his fate in the coming weeks once @entity22 touches down in @entity23 after @entity25 ’s involvement at the @entity26 , but @entity27 understands that @entity8 ’s preference would be to remain with @entity1 next season			1
@entity8 was sir @entity54 ’s final signing as @entity1 manager , joining the club in a £ 15million deal and on a five - and - a - half year contract			0
@entity1 will not be keen to give up on such a significant investment so early in his spell at the club			0
however , there is also a recognition that work will need to be done to resuscitate the winger ’s @entity1 career after a debut campaign fraught with tension			0
challenge : @entity8 has struggled to make the step up at @entity1 since joining from @entity46 despite impressing on the club ’s pre-season tour , relations between @entity73 and @entity1 became increasingly strained last season , with former manager @entity48 showing little faith at all in the 21 - year - old			1
although the player felt that he was not being given a fair chance by @entity48 , the consensus from @entity1 insiders was that @entity8 had failed to adapt to the very highest standards expected by the club			2
@entity48 felt that his contribution on the training ground was below the level that he demanded and senior figures became concerned around december that there was little sign of improvement			0
experience : the attacker was shipped out on loan to @entity52 but could not save them from the drop for all the defects in @entity8 ’s game , however , supporters and certain coaches began to question why @entity8 was not handed an opportunity in the first - team when established regulars such as @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 so often produced below - par performances , as @entity1 slumped to 7th place in the @entity51 and crashed out of both the @entity43 and @entity110 in january			1
@entity22 is expected to take guidance from assistant manager @entity112 over his young players but @entity8 ’s raw pace and ability to take players on may appeal to a manager whose teams are known for attacking with speed and on the counter-attack			0
however , after also struggling for form under @entity122 at @entity52 , @entity8 has work to do to convince the @entity1 hierarchy that he can make a positive contribution at @entity7			0
waiting game : @entity8 is eager to impress @entity6 ahead of @entity1 's pre-season tour of the @entity11 @entity129 's penultimate tribute to @entity8			1

the attacker failed to impress in his debut season at @entity1
he was shipped out on loan to @entity52 but could not save them from drop
former @entity46 player wants chance to impress new boss @entity22
he is yet to be informed if he will be part of @entity1 's pre-season tour of @entity11
