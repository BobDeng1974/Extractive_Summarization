on the left is a protester asking businesses to oppose @entity2 the world spewed far more carbon pollution into the air last year than ever before , with emissions spurred largely by @entity53 , the @entity9 and @entity54			2
this is according to a recent report that estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons ( 36.1 billion metric tons ) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal , oil and gas			0
that is 778 million tons ( 706 metric tons ) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year , despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases			0
the report also said that @entity53 's per capita emissions had surpassed those of @entity70 for the first time , between 2013 and 2014			0

' everyone understands climate change is occurring , and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place			2
' and so we should not be aligned with such people - they 're just , they 're just literally lying			0
' according to the @entity13 , 45 major corporations it investigated belonged to lobby groups which had anti-climate views			0
