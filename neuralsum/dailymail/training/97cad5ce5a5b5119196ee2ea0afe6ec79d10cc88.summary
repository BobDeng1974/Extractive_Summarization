mr @entity1 ’s sister , @entity30 , 35 , said after the inquest : ‘ we knew that something was not right			1
‘ his eye was drooping , but they thought he was just like that			2
‘ it ’s devastating , we just think what would have happened if they diagnosed him earlier ? ’ the inquest has highlighted that symptoms can be wrongly overlooked in patients with learning difficulties because it is assumed they are part of their disability			2
mr @entity1 ’s family is determined his death will have an impact on hospital procedures by forcing improvements at the @entity51 and raising awareness of the problem			1
his younger brother , @entity54 , 22 , said : ‘ we hope that this will be the spark for change and we expect to see big changes from the @entity58			2

@entity15 has pledged to host training sessions , improve and overhaul procedures and appoint a learning disabilities champion in the emergency department acting coroner dr @entity119 said the symptoms , including drowsiness , confusion and a drooping eyelid , should have rang alarm bells			1
