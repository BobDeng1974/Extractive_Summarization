by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 23 february 2013 @entity1 , pictured at the @entity2 in @entity3 , described the killings as ' monstrous ' but did not make a formal apology it is 5.15pm on sunday , april 13 , 1919 , in the @entity8 holy city of @entity3 in the @entity9			1
an open - topped motorcar pulls up near the @entity11 , a seven - acre area of waste ground , and brigadier @entity13 steps out			1
he then attempts to bring an armoured car , with its machine gun , into the area , but is foiled because the street is too narrow			0
no matter , he orders his force of @entity21 and @entity22 troops to open fire into a peaceful crowd of local men , women and children who are listening to @entity29 speeches about non-violence			1
the shooting continues until the ammunition runs out and , in the words of the memorial there , the ground is ‘ saturated with the blood of about 2,000 @entity21 patriots ’			0
then he calmly goes back to his headquarters , triumphantly successful in his premeditated plan to murder innocents in the name of the @entity43			2
that is the popular view of the @entity45 , sedulously promoted by the 1982 movie @entity47 and the one taught in @entity43 and in @entity43 schools today			2
it is the story of the vicious @entity50 yet again killing thousands , out of what has been described as ‘ imperial terrorism ’			0
in 2005 , in reviews of a biography of @entity13 entitled @entity57 , the massacre was variously described as ‘ an unforgivable atrocity ’ , ‘ state terrorism ’ , ‘ a heinous crime ’ and ‘ the biggest and bloodiest blot on the generally benign record of @entity43 rule in @entity43 ’			1
yet the true story of what happened that day in @entity3 is far more nuanced and @entity1 , at the end of his trip to @entity43 last week , was quite right not to make a formal apology for it , merely reiterating what @entity70 correctly said at the time , that it was ‘ monstrous ’			1
for everything stated in my opening paragraphs above is either completely wrong or was certainly not what it seemed			0
in fact , according to a superb book called the @entity45 : the @entity85 , by @entity81 , a lecturer in defence studies at @entity83 , @entity84 , which was published last year , it turns out that @entity13 had no plans at all to commit a massacre , and that when he arrived he was expecting a much smaller crowd than the 25,000 who were present			1
he panicked when he realised his force of 90 men – including 40 without rifles – were outnumbered by 275 to one			0
‘ i realised that my force was small and to hesitate might induce attack , ’ he later explained			0
‘ i immediately opened fire and dispersed the crowd			2
’ anti-british feeling was at its highest since the @entity98 in 1857			1
only days earlier , huge mobs had killed five @entity100 and as @entity81 remarks of the attacks elsewhere in the @entity9 : ‘ far from being peaceful crowds , many of the rioters were armed with lathis [ metal - tipped sticks ] , bill hooks and various other weapons , including swords and kerosene oil , which was used to burn government buildings			1
’ brutal : a painting of @entity43 soldiers shooting civilians in @entity3 on april 13 , 1919 if a revolt had caught fire in the @entity9 , it would have led to the deaths of tens of thousands of @entity21 from all the main communities			1
as the half - million or so who died there during @entity123 in 1947 - 48 remind us , the @entity9 was a sectarian tinderbox			1
in that context , 379 deaths – the casualty figure always maintained by the @entity43 – might be monstrous , as the @entity129 has rightly said , but it nipped in the bud something that could have been calamitous			1
at that point , the @entity43 in @entity3 had only 75 armed and 100 unarmed constables with whom to control a city of 150,000 inhabitants			1
' distraught ' : brigadier @entity13 was in charge of @entity43 troops and ordered the massacre in @entity3 three days before the massacre , a mob had gone on a rampage in the city and three bank officials were lynched in their offices , their corpses burnt in the street			1
two other officials were murdered , and an elderly female missionary , @entity150 , was hauled off her bicycle , beaten to the ground and left for dead			0
posters appeared which alleged that the @entity43 raped @entity21 girls in @entity3 and urged @entity21 to ‘ dishonour ’ and ‘ clear the country of all @entity158 ladies ’			1
@entity13 feared that it might take little for ‘ peaceful ’ crowds such as the one in the @entity11 – which was overwhelmingly made up of young men – to turn violent			2
had @entity13 premeditated a massacre , he would have brought more than 50 riflemen with him			2
although the @entity11 crowd had no firearms , many did have lathis and a concerted rush , which @entity13 ’s staff officer captain @entity170 feared might happen , could have spelt disaster			2
nor is it true that @entity13 wanted to use a machine gun but could not get it into the @entity11 , as the myth - makers still insist			2
in fact , there was a @entity178 machine gun in the armoured car that he knew he could have simply detached from its stand , since it was designed for dismounted use			0
nor did @entity13 use more than a fraction of the ammunition he brought with him : 1,650 rounds out of 9,000			0
what makes @entity13 ’s over-reaction understandable was his often - repeated warnings throughout the morning of april 13 that no demonstration could take place in a city that was declared to be under martial law , and that ‘ all gatherings will be fired upon ’			1
this proclamation was made three times in @entity196 and @entity197 – languages understood by 90 per cent of the city ’s inhabitants – at no fewer than 19 places by @entity13 and a detachment of @entity21 and @entity43 troops			1
as they marched through the city , @entity13 was spat upon by ‘ bored , sullen and hostile ’ groups of youths , who some of the troops felt were ‘ so hostile that violence could have broken out at any moment ’			2
having never been to the @entity11 before , @entity13 did not know that it was walled in on three sides by the backs of houses , with a low wall on the far side			0
his view was further impeded by the dust thrown up by the 25,000 people present			0
‘ @entity13 came to me all dazed and shaken up , ’ a @entity43 administrator later recalled of that evening , ‘ and said , “ i never knew there was no way out			1
” ’ accepted version : the depiction of the mass killings at @entity3 in the 1982 @entity228 - winning film @entity47 massacre : @entity43 soldiers opened fire on around 25,000 peaceful protestors close to the @entity2 in @entity3 although @entity13 later claimed to have undertaken the massacre to ‘ save ’ @entity43 , @entity81 convincingly explains that he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful afternoon			1
as well as being ‘ dazed and shaken up ’ – hardly the response of a soldier who had had murder in his mind – all the witnesses recall how @entity13 ‘ was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened ’			0
one witness described him as ‘ distraught ’ , and he told a friend six months afterwards : ‘ i have n’t had a night ’s sleep since that happened			0
i keep on seeing it over again			0
’ gunfire : a painting depicts the moment around 50 @entity43 riflemen fired 1,650 rounds into a crown of @entity21 protestors the @entity21 estimates of the number of the dead are wildly exaggerated , although @entity81 believes that the number given by the @entity255 of 379 is probably too low by 35 or so			2
it was certainly not in the ‘ thousands ’ , however			0
and despite the depictment in the movie @entity47 , there were very few women and children present			0
a deputation of @entity21 merchants and shopkeepers soon after the massacre actually thanked @entity13 for preventing looting , and he received many other such tokens of gratitude ; the guardians of the @entity2 invested him there as an honorary @entity8			0
if one wants to find examples of large - scale killing going on in @entity3 in the @entity272 , one might also look at @entity274 ’s 1984 storming of the @entity2 , in which as many as 1,000 died			2
because that was a massacre of @entity21 by @entity21 , it did not attain the condemnation that has attended brigadier @entity13			1
so whose fault was this undeniable tragedy ? ultimately , of course , @entity13 must take the blame for giving the order to fire , but the organisers of the banned meeting must share some of it too			2
they knew how febrile the atmosphere was , and had heard @entity13 ’s order not to congregate			0
yet trusting in their non-violent saintliness , the @entity290 still called together a crowd of 25,000 people for a demonstration they knew to be extremely provocative			0
they irresponsibly and , in the event , suicidally went ahead , putting propaganda and politics before people ’s lives			0
instead of being criticised for their recklessness , the organisers have been hailed as heroes , while @entity13 has been demonised			0
commemoration : the prime minister lays a wreath at the memorial to the victims of the @entity3 massacre remorse : but mr @entity1 stopped short of apologising for @entity311 's role in the killings			1

brigadier @entity13 ordered troops to fire on a crowd of 25,000 in @entity3 , @entity9 , on april 13 , 1919
@entity311 maintain 379 were killed - lower than the 1000 stated by @entity43
anti-british feeling was at its highest since the @entity98 in 1857
a revolt in the @entity9 would have led to tens of thousands of deaths
