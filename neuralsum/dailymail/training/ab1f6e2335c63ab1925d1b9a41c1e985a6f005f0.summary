@entity0 , 71 , was deselected as @entity1 ’s parliamentary candidate for the @entity25 and @entity26 seat in @entity11 last month , after he admitted animal welfare charges			1
he appeared before @entity28 yesterday where district judge @entity29 jailed him for four months and disqualified him indefinitely from keeping sheep			2
@entity31 , defending , immediately lodged an appeal against the sentence but the judge refused to let @entity0 out on bail while it is decided			2
a previous hearing was told how the sheep were kept as pets but were left to fend for themselves after @entity0 abandoned them over one of the wettest winters on record			1
@entity45 , prosecuting , said @entity46 dispatched investigators to @entity48 in @entity49 , owned by @entity0 on february 6 after a string of complaints			2
a team of police and council officials including health inspector @entity55 and veterinary officer @entity57 arrived to find his land strewn with carcasses of sheep and lambs			2

disgrace : inspectors located dozens of live animals who were emaciated , suffering from lameness and ' close to death ' mr @entity45 told the court that @entity0 treated the flock as pets but they had been ' left out to their own devices to survive a very wet winter '			1
he added : ' there was insufficient food , bedding or dry areas for the sheep , which were huddled together and did not have food of the quality which would be expected			0
' sheds which could have housed them were being used to store machinery			0
' the court heard that @entity0 bought the farm in 2001 and brought in sheep to help maintain the grassland			1
mr @entity31 , defending , said @entity0 has an extremely high iq of 130 to 142 but suffers from a form of @entity104 ’s syndrome that means he struggles to interact with other people			0
as he became more reclusive , the former parliamentary candidate started treating the animals as pets but when their numbers swelled to 450 he simply could n’t cope , mr @entity31 added			0
scandal : 119 sheep died and those who survived were starved of proper food and kept in squalor - with many more put down because of their poor condition @entity0 admitted six charges including failing to dispose of carcasses and causing unnecessary suffering to sheep by failing to address their emaciation and lameness			1
he was also ordered to pay £ 714.42 in costs			0
speaking after yesterday ’s sentencing , health inspector mr @entity55 said : ' in 15 years this case is by far the worst i have ever experienced			0
' dead sheep were scattered across the farm , new born lambs had died after getting stuck in mud			1
' mr @entity0 had done very little to ensure the safety of his sheep , his sheds were full of junk so the sheep had no shelter from the weather			2
' the lame and emaciated sheep were just ignored			0
' a spokesman for the @entity142 added : ' the scenes that greeted the local authority animal health team look appalling			0
