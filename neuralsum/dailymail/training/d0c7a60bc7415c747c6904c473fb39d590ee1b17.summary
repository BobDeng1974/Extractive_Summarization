by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 10:56 est , 11 january 2014 a @entity3 councillor who won £ 100,000 on a lottery scratchcard has been jailed after then plundering a widow 's life savings of more than £ 154,000 pounds which he gambled away on slot machines			1
shamed @entity10 was starting a five - year sentence after a judge described him as ' arrogant , self - deluding and shambolic '			2
the 75 - year - old conservative had an addiction for slot machines and squandered away the savings of @entity16 , who suffered from @entity17 's , meaning that when she died aged 92 , she had to be given a pauper 's funeral			1
jailed : @entity10 , who stole more than £ 154,000 from widow @entity16 ' bank account after she had given him power of attorney @entity10 ruthlessly raided the bank account of mrs @entity16 , a friend of 30 years , after he was given legal control over her affairs when her memory began to fail			1
he had won £ 100,000 pounds on a lottery scratchcard he bought at a newsagent 's shop in @entity29 in november 2009			2
he was convicted after a six - day trial of the theft of £ 154,000 pounds , which he made in thousands of bank transfers and cash withdrawals as mrs @entity16 sat in care homes			1
he even bought himself trips to @entity39 casinos with her money			1
when mrs @entity16 died in 2012 , she was given a pauper 's funeral funded by the local council , because @entity10 had even drained her accounts of any money to pay for her burial			1
speaking at @entity50 , judge @entity49 labelled @entity10 's actions ' shambolic and devious '			1
vulnerable : mrs @entity16 had been diagnosed with dementia and had to be given a pauper 's funeral ' in my opinion there is no degree of trust higher than conveyed by an enduring power of attorney for someone with lesser mental capacity , ' she said			1
' there is no greater breach of trust than the abuse of that power to the benefit of the holder			0
' the court heard how @entity72 had begun siphoning off mrs @entity16 ' money in 2005			1
he had been given power of attorney the previous year and registered it after medical advice on her condition in march 2005			2
judge @entity49 said figures showed that in 2007 alone he took £ 11,000 pounds in cash and £ 26,000 pounds in bank transfers			0
this money was going , unbelievably unless you heard the evidence , into gambling machines , ' she said , adding that his job as a car parts salesman meant he often stopped and used slot machines at motorway service stations			1
' you even went gaming in @entity39 , on two occasions , using @entity16 ' money , ' said the judge			1
she slammed his excuses that he was draining her funds at her own expressed wish to deprive her in - laws , the @entity99 family , of money if her son and primary heir @entity101 died , as ' frankly absurd '			2
@entity101 , who lives in @entity103 and gave evidence at the trial via a videolink , lost out on more than £ 70,000 in inheritance , with @entity108 paying a similar sum in care costs after @entity16 's assets fell below the threshold for assistance			1
mrs @entity16 was visited regularly by @entity10 in the two @entity115 care homes she lived at in her latter years			1
judge @entity49 said she took into account @entity10 's 26 years of public service on councils including the @entity119 and @entity120 , as well as charity work for @entity122			2
' all this is in strange and stark contrast to the devious and shambolic way you handled @entity16 ' affairs and the way you attempted to pull rank at @entity108 in interview when your actions were discovered , ' she said , adding that his justifications were ' arrogant and self - deluding			2
' she praised the efforts of investigation officer detective sergeant @entity134 in uncovering the theft			0
trial : judge @entity49 said @entity10 's ' arrogant and self - deluding ' actions did n't match the charity work he had undertaken			2
he was jailed yesterday at @entity139 @entity10 , of @entity140 , @entity141 , shook his head as he was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment , half of which is to be served in custody			0
he waved to his daughter , who was in court as he was led away			0
following the sentence , @entity99 , mrs @entity16 ' sister - in - law , said : ' he got what he deserved			1
this draws a line under it			0
i am pleased for my husband and sister - in - law [ @entity157 ]			0
mrs @entity99 , from @entity158 , near @entity159 , @entity160 , was praised during the trial , in which she gave evidence , after she alerted authorities to the theft after mrs @entity16 ' funeral and thorough examination of her bank records			1
' i just never trusted him , right from the beginning			0
it was just a gut feeling , ' she said			0
the court had earlier heard from @entity172 , prosecuting , who said : ' this was a long course of offending that continued even after the major capital assets had been depleted and continued taking her pension , resulting in cheques to the local authority bouncing right up until @entity16 died in january 2012			2
' he said @entity10 , who wore a green fleece , red jumper and black trousers in court , had received £ 120,000 pounds from the sale of his half of the house he shared with his wife , from whom he is recently separated			1
a hearing under the @entity190 will be held on 3 april to determine compensation and costs payments			0
@entity10 had maintained his denial of any wrongdoing throughout the trial and even in interviews with probation officers prior to sentence			0
@entity199 , mitigating , said @entity10 was ' a man of exemplary good character ' prior to the theft			0
' he secured for @entity122 a building to use and has , in a real and proper sense , done good works for the community , ' she said			0
' he was a good friend to @entity157 and i submit that his conduct does not detract from that			0
' she claimed his actions were that of a gambling addict , which judge @entity49 agreed with , and said : ' the whole episode is one that is causing everyone in his family extreme stress			0
' despite this , judge @entity49 ordered @entity10 , who resigned from the conservative party following his conviction in november , to just one year less than the maximum sentence of six years .			0

@entity10 blew more than £ 154,000 on slot machines and trips to @entity39
the money belonged to @entity16 , who had given him power of attorney
widowed mrs @entity16 suffered from dementia and died aged 92
her family became *suspicious* when she received only a pauper 's funeral
