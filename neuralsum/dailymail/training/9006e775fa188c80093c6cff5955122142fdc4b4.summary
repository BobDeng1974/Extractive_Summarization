' i was walking around @entity82 at the base of @entity98 canyon and there were these large estates with big walls and dogs and cameras and guards that would appear if you looked too close			0
' and i thought it might be interesting to get a helicopter and photograph the hidden yards behind the walls ' when i was young i would fly myself around @entity29 and take pictures			2
i was fascinated by how things appeared from the air			0
' so for this project i spent many hours flying around @entity29 in a helicopter with the door off shooting with very high resolution equipment so i can blow the prints up to 70 inches for my galleries			1

he said : ' i use a stabilizing gyro because there is always some movement			0
' i like to compose graphic images			1
' my background as an architect wants symmetry and straight lines so i have to be in close communication with the pilot in trying to get exactly where i want			2
' i like to ponder how things are created and from above you can see how the geography of the landscape affects the arrangement of roads and residential and commercial building sites and understand more about why the city looks the way it does			1
' you can also see the hand of the architect in planned developments in ways you never can from the ground			2
' i have always loved flying since i was a boy			2
' part of that thrill was being able to see everything from the birds eye			2
i hope i can share some of that fascination with these photographs			0
