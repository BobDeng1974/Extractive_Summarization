a young groom 's family are demanding that his bride gives them back their $ 500,000 ' dowry ' after she reportedly left him for always siding with his mother			1
@entity7 , an exchange student from @entity9 , and @entity10 , a @entity11 from an @entity9 family , met in calculus class at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity11 , and married a year later , on @entity16 in 2012			1
@entity7 moved in with her new husband 's parents - but 18 months later , she could no longer bear to live with her mother - in - law , her lawyer told the @entity21			1
she left him in december 2013 and he filed for divorce in january 2014			0
split : @entity7 , left , and @entity10 , right , divorced last year and his family is now demanding that she gives back a share of property they gave her as a dowry before the wedding before their wedding , the groom 's family had given his bride half ownership of a $ 1 million home in @entity15			1
such dowries are in keeping with @entity9 tradition , the paper reported			1
the @entity10 family , which owns a jewelry business in @entity15 , demanded that @entity41 give the dowry back in light of the failed marriage			1
but last week a judge dismissed the @entity47 ' claims for the courts to order that she hand over her share of property , as well as the cost of the wedding - around $ 50,000 - and wedding gifts			2
the family claims that the young bride ' acted fraudulently by tricking ' them into handing over part of the property and getting @entity10 to sponsor her for her residency			2
hurt : a lawyer for @entity7 said she left her husband because she could n't live with his parents they also claimed that @entity7 's father had promised to hand back wedding gifts if she left the marriage ' or acted inappropriately ' towards her new husband , the @entity21 reported			1
but the judge , justice @entity69 , disputed the claims			0
' the gift was made without any expectation of remuneration but with the expectation that @entity7 would marry @entity75 , which occurred , ' @entity69 said			0
' the parties entered into a valid marriage , which was consummated , and they lived together as man and wife for approximately one year and a half			0
' he added that @entity7 's older brother also lives in @entity15 so could have sponsored her for residency , rather than her needing to turn to her boyfriend			0
@entity7 's lawyer , @entity86 , added : ' she married him in good faith and that 's what the court found			2
sometimes things do n't work out , unfortunately , but you ca n't go back a year and half or two years later and allege that there was fraudulent intent			0
' @entity7 , who still lives in @entity11 , told the @entity21 she is ' pleased ' with the decision			0
her lawyer said that @entity7 did n't want to leave the marriage and still loved her husband but could no longer live with her mother - in - law			1
but @entity10 and his mother , @entity101 , denied the claims and @entity101 said that she had a ' beautiful relationship ' with her daughter - in - law			2
happier days : the pair met in a calculus class at @entity14 , pictured , and married a year later of his ex-wife , @entity10 added : ' i prefer to think that she 's non-existent			2
' he added that in @entity9 culture , the dowry is supposed to be returned if a wife leaves her husband			0
the family does not yet know if they 'll appeal the judge 's decision .			0

@entity7 , *23* , and @entity10 , *26* , married on @entity117 and @entity41 moved in with her husband 's family
