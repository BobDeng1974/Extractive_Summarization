when @entity1 crashed out of the last global limited - overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the @entity5 to complete what had been a hugely disappointing @entity7			1
fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match , this time against @entity12 , where @entity1 have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match			1
@entity14 will not need reminding that a dispirited @entity1 lost to @entity5 in @entity15 and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage			0
@entity1 coach @entity22 and batting coach @entity23 watch over training on wednesday the @entity26 flops form a huddle on the @entity28 as they prepare to face @entity12 indications are @entity22 will keep his job , at least for the @entity31 in the @entity32 , whatever happens at the @entity28 on friday morning but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the ‘ minnows			1
’ the fact @entity1 turned up early on wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something , anything , from their worst ever @entity26			1
@entity1 are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an @entity52 nation who can not believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their @entity26 so soon			2
@entity22 ( centre back ) looks set to keep his job at least until after the @entity31 in the @entity58 victory against an @entity12 side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of @entity64 to be here would barely regain any pride for an @entity1 team who are still coming to terms with what they have done			1
but for @entity22 it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three - @entity78 series in the @entity58 next month that will be named on tuesday			1
@entity1 will be without @entity79 and @entity80 , two players who can still expect a one - day future , when they face @entity12 and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to @entity86 on april 2			1
@entity79 strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by @entity15 in @entity89 while @entity90 has a ‘ stress reaction ’ in his third metatarsal of his left foot			2
both will be assessed when @entity1 get home			0
senior @entity1 paceman @entity96 warms up with a rugby ball on the @entity28 during their session in the sun in their absence it is to be hoped @entity1 give games to the two players yet to appear in this @entity26 in @entity105 and @entity106 , not least before both could then be making their final one - day international appearances			1
if @entity1 are serious about ever making an impact in one - day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019			0
that means there is little point in them persevering in 50 - over cricket beyond friday with the likes of @entity105 , @entity106 and the senior trio of @entity123 , @entity96 and @entity124 , who yesterday insisted he wants to play on			0
a dead rubber against @entity12 is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical @entity26 record as themselves – just a single victory against @entity132			1
there was a familiar figure at the helm of the @entity12 team at the @entity28 yesterday in the avuncular form of coach @entity138 , the former @entity139 batsman who has ignored security advice to work in @entity141			2
history repeating ? @entity1 will be eager to avoid a repeat to their loss to @entity5 ( pictured ) in their @entity146 dead rubber when the same scenario is presented to them on friday against @entity12 @entity138 has been in charge of a team who have defeated @entity1 before – when he coached @entity151 in the @entity152 – and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland			1
‘ @entity1 are not in the best of nick and we still believe we ’ve got a scare in us in this @entity26 , especially if we show composure at the top of the order , ’ said @entity138			2
‘ if we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock			0
‘ i ’m obviously sad to see @entity1 ’s demise but i ’m delighted to be here with @entity12			2
we ’ve had some great learning experiences , had our first win and gave @entity170 a scare			0
this has been a shop window for @entity12 cricket and i think we ’ve made friends			0
we play with a freedom that i ’ve tried to enhance			0
’ it is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in @entity1 ’s cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home			0
otherwise they will lose as many friends as the @entity12 have gained .			0

@entity1 face @entity12 with more to lose than a @entity26 dead rubber
they must avoid another shocking loss to minnows after @entity188 defeat
@entity1 are *reeling* while the @entity12 *'s* journey to be here is remarkable
@entity22 looks set to keep job at least until after series in @entity58
@entity1 went through full training session in @entity28 on wednesday
@entity79 and @entity80 will miss @entity12 match through *injury*
