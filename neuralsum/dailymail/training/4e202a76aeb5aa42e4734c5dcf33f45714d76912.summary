' could be modernised ' : @entity0 , the @entity1 director general , said that £ 145.50 fee could be changed to account for using the @entity3 viewers who avoid the licence fee by only watching catch - up shows on @entity3 could have to pay up , the @entity1 ’s director general warned yesterday			1
@entity0 ’s comments come amid growing concerns that younger viewers are using free catch - up services to dodge the £ 145.50 annual charge			1
he insisted that the licence fee has ‘ plenty of life yet ’ but admitted it could be changed			1
currently , a loophole means viewers who only watch catch - up shows instead of on tv as they are broadcast do not have to pay the licence fee			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it could be modernised again so it applies to watching @entity1 programmes both live and on @entity3			1
this is for the government to decide , but worth considering			2
’ in june , the @entity26 revealed that 463,846 people avoided buying a tv licence by declaring they had not owned a set or watched live shows in the past year			1
according to recent figures from media regulator @entity34 , growing numbers of young people watch tv online , on devices such as tablets , smartphones and laptops , rather than on traditional sets			1
those aged 16 to 24 spend just half their viewing time watching shows live as they are screened			1
the rest of the time they use free catch - up services such as @entity3 as well as dvds , recorded tv shows or films , and programmes they have bought and downloaded from the internet			2
there is concern that older watchers are effectively being penalised for watching on tv sets rather than on computers and other devices			1
however , @entity0 downplayed concerns that the loophole could threaten the @entity68 ’s funding , saying the vast majority of viewers still watch live tv			1
writing in the @entity72 , he said : ‘ the other charge people make is that the licence fee must be broken because technology is moving so quickly			1
live and kicking : @entity0 said events such as @entity81 's @entity80 game against @entity82 still draw millions of live viewers ‘ why pay the fee when you can watch everything on @entity3 ? whilst we now have a huge choice of programmes to watch on catch - up , close to 90 per cent of all tv viewing is still live			1
‘ when @entity81 played @entity82 in the @entity80 , more than 15million people watched at nearly midnight because they wanted to share the experience			2
fewer than 2 per cent of households only watch on - demand programmes and this is growing only slowly			2
’ a change to the licence could be made when the @entity1 charter is renewed in 2017			1
an option is for viewers to enter a code on the @entity3 website before catching up on shows to show they have paid			0
@entity106 television is being bought wholesale by rich @entity108 corporations , @entity110 ’s chief executive warned last night			2
@entity111 said internet giants such as @entity113 and @entity114 could invest here to cut their domestic tax bills and be making our favourite shows in the future			0
@entity108 giant @entity120 now owns @entity121 and @entity122 has a 6.4 per cent stake in @entity124			0
unrepentant : @entity125 stands by his language @entity125 remains unrepentant for sparking a series of race rows , the @entity1 ’s television chief has revealed			2
the @entity135 presenter still ‘ does n’t see the problem ’ with using words like ‘ n * * * * * ’ and ‘ slope ’ despite the public outrage they caused , director of television @entity131 said			0
mr @entity131 declined to say whether @entity125 would be fired , but said he found his behaviour ‘ entirely unacceptable ’ , adding : ‘ no one show or person is bigger than the @entity1			2
’ speaking at the @entity143 , he said : ‘ i was very , very clear in public and in private with @entity145 was incredibly unhappy with his language			0
‘ @entity125 knows that that ’s my position and that that ’s going to impact on the way the show is thought about in future			0
people have different views on @entity125			0
obviously loads of people think that me being so angry about it is an overreaction			0
i do n’t think it was an overreaction			0
he does n’t see the problem with some of the language he used			0
’ @entity125 , 54 , escaped the sack in may despite being forced to apologise for apparently using the word ‘ n * * * * * ’ during a @entity135 outtake			0
@entity125 initially denied he used the word , but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was ‘ mortified ’ by the upset he had caused , and ‘ begged forgiveness ’ of his fans			0
it followed a racist joke made by the £ 1million - a - year host in an episode which screened in march , involving the term ‘ slope ’			0
asked if the hit @entity175 show and its lead presenter were ‘ untouchable ’ , mr @entity131 said : ‘ it is like football , no one is bigger than the club			0

@entity0 , @entity1 director general , said annual fee could be modernised
almost half a million @entity106 already dodge the £ 145.50 charge
*increasing* numbers of young people avoid all live tv , and hence the fee
@entity0 *suggested* the government could change way licence fee works
but also pointed out that most still watch programmes live on tv sets
