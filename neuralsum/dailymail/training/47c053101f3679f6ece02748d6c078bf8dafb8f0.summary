mr @entity14 , 40 , said : ‘ i honestly thought i was going to lose my baby son to cancer			1
‘ it does n’t even seem possible			0
but it ’s an enormous relief that @entity8 looks like he ’s recovering			2
’ doctors told @entity14 and mrs @entity5 it was extremely rare for a child so young to be diagnosed with liver cancer			1
mr @entity14 said : ‘ the doctors said it is more common when children are about three years old , but it ’s near enough unheard of for a baby as young as @entity8 to get the diagnosis			1
’ @entity8 was found to have a 10cm tumour on his liver after his stomach swelled and he lost his appetite			1
he is pictured with his parents , @entity43 and @entity4 , and his older sister , @entity44 doctors tried to shrink @entity8 's tumour with chemotherapy but this failed so they had to consider a transplant mrs @entity5 , 24 , said that @entity8 started to get unwell around christmas time - beginning what would become a hellish few months			1
she said : ‘ his stomach was all swollen up , he was obviously in a lot of pain and was n’t really eating anything			2
‘ @entity8 did n’t ever seem happy either , he was always crying and seemed distressed			0

mr @entity14 said : ‘ when we were at the hospital they did loads of scans on him and told us that @entity8 had cancer in his liver			1
‘ it was such a shock to hear that @entity8 had cancer , we could n’t believe it - you do n’t hear of babies having cancer			0
it was heart - breaking			0
’ @entity8 then underwent tests at both @entity111 and @entity112 before undergoing a course of chemotherapy in @entity115			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ what doctors were going to do was use chemotherapy to shrink the tumour down and then surgically remove it from the liver			1
‘ but the tumour was about 10cm wide , which is really big for a baby			1
‘ the chemotherapy did n’t work , though , and the doctors told us that the tumour had not shrunk down to the size where they could remove it			1
’ the couple were then told that @entity8 would need a transplant operation to survive			0
a week later they were told a donor had been found and headed to @entity132 only to discover the donor was n’t a match			1
mrs @entity5 stayed at hospital with @entity8 while mr @entity14 returned home to look after their eldest daughter , @entity137 , five , who was staying with relatives			2
but early the next afternoon , doctors told the parents another donor had been found			1
@entity143 ( pictured with his father , @entity4 , after his birth ) received a new liver from a teenage boy mr @entity14 said : ‘ it was a mixture of massive relief - but then the fear of losing @entity8 in the operating theatre kicked in			1
‘ we do n’t know anything about the donor , apart from it was from a teenage boy and the surgeons had to trim the liver down for @entity8			1
‘ the operation was about seven hours long			0
‘ when we were told everything had gone to plan , we were so happy			0
it was the best feeling of my life knowing @entity8 was well			0
’ barely a month later , the couple are already noticing a difference in @entity143			0
@entity8 is now recovering after his liver transplant but will need to take anti-rejection drugs all his life mrs @entity5 said : ‘ when @entity8 was ill , he was so pale , with black eyes - he looked like a little ghost			2
‘ but now he ’s getting back to normal - the colour has returned to his cheeks , he ’s eating , playing , laughing and giggling , it ’s amazing to see him happy			0
’ @entity8 is still being monitored closely by doctors and will have to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ this whole thing has just been a living nightmare for our family			2
‘ but our little boy ’s alive , he ’s got his shot at life and we could n’t be happier			0
