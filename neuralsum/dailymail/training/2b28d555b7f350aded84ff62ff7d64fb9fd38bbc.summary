@entity1 boss @entity0 admits he has been saddened by calls from the club 's fans for his head			1
the 52 - year - old was booed whenever he entered his technical area during saturday 3 - 0 @entity9 victory over @entity10 at @entity11 , which ended a run of six successive defeats			2
however , he is refusing to allow the pressure to get to him as he prepares for sunday 's final day trip to @entity16			2
not happy : @entity0 is saddened by @entity1 supporters calling for his head as the club 's manager sack the board ! @entity1 fans have turned up with banners printing their displeasure in recent weeks @entity0 told the @entity25 : ' obviously , i 'm a little bit sad about the situation , but my resolve has to be strong to make sure the players are ready for @entity16			1
' we need to go to @entity32 and put in a top performance			0
' @entity0 , who signed an eight - year contract in september 2012 , is not understood to be in any immediate danger , although he will have to negotiate his end - of - season debrief with owner @entity37 , something he managed by the skin of his teeth 12 months ago after a desperate fight against relegation			1
this time around , the @entity43 will finish no lower than 10th , a significant improvement on the last campaign , although one which might have been markedly better but for the decision to sell star midfielder @entity47 in january and not replace him			0
tricky period : @entity48 scored as they beat @entity10 at the weekend but it has been a difficult spell should @entity0 receive the green light from @entity37 , he will hope to embark upon a major rebuilding exercise this summer with strikers @entity53 and @entity55 only on loan and @entity48 out of contract , while a replacement for @entity47 will be a priority too			1
@entity0 said : ' we need to make sure that we start next season in the same position we started this season			2
we had a strong team and were challenging for @entity65			0
' but towards the back end of the season , we have not been that good			0
we need to accept that , accept the criticism and make the right calls			0

@entity1 supporters want to see @entity0 sacked
the manager has *presided* over a dismal run of *results* this year
@entity0 wants the green light from @entity37 for a *spending* *splurge*
