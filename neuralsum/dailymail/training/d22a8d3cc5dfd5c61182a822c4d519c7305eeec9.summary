the ' nanny from hell ' who refused to move out of a @entity4 family 's home despite doing no work has hit back at her former employers saying they once tried to feed her dog food			1
@entity9 , 64 , spoke out for the first time after it emerged she told the @entity13 family she could be out of their @entity15 home as long as her long list of conditions were kept			1
the alarming demands include providing her air - conditioning and hand soap at all times , vacating the property between the hours of 8am and 5pm and giving her access to healthy meals - or cough up $ 200 so that she can go out for a meal			1
but @entity9 has now claimed in an interview that it was the family who were being demanding as they worked her as many as 10 hours a day without any lunch or coffee breaks			1
she called @entity47 a ' drama queen ' and ' @entity49 ' who spent most of her day on the phone ' just like a teenager ' and who wanted her to work harder than her board was worth			1
mrs @entity47 has previously said that her three children , aged 11 , four and one , initially loved @entity9 but after three weeks , she refused to help them and claimed she had health problems			1
after sending her warning letters asking her to improve , the family eventually told @entity9 that she needed to leave and within 12 hours , her cable , air conditioning and internet access were cut off			1
but she claimed that it did n't stop there - because the family tried to feed her dog food			2
family : @entity47 and @entity67 hired @entity9 through @entity68 to look after their 3 young children @entity9 's letter to the family reads : ' agreement : i will voluntarily agree to leave by 6pm on 7/6/14 if each and all of the following conditions are met : 1			1

' ' right after she served that letter , she gave the kids three cans of dog food and told them to put it outside my room for my food , ' she said			0
' and so little @entity124 , four - years - old , knocks on the door and says , " @entity9 , your dinner 's here , we got dog food for you "			1
' she said that she had planned to move out in 30 days , but the situation ' got complicated '			0
but she now could be out of the house by the weekend - as long as certain conditions were met			0
a letter @entity9 sent to the @entity135 and seen by @entity136 shows her demands , including that she has access to amenities , healthy food and a well - stocked bathroom			1
' @entity47 and kids must vacate the premises between the hours of 8am and 5pm until 7/6/14 whether i elect to leave during the day or not , ' one of the demands reads			1
' i 'm either given access to healthy food or given $ 200 to eat out , ' she wrote in another			1
' bathrooms must be stocked up with @entity85 ( toilet paper ) and hand soap at all times			0
' the list says , if the conditions are met , she will voluntarily leave on july 6 and will not seek any of the legal remedies for ' your past violations of our agreement '			2
police had previously said they could not kick @entity9 out of the home because they had willingly invited her into their home and she had established residency			2
if they wanted to get rid of her , they had to evict her , they said			0
the @entity135 were also not impressed with this latest correspondence from @entity165			0
' she wrote it to get me really upset , to get me furious and she did get me furious , but i did n’t respond to her , ' mrs @entity47 told @entity136			1
demands : an image shows the handwritten letter sent to the @entity135 outlining the conditions they must keep to ensure @entity9 moves out of their home before this weekend ' she 's playing games			1
she knows i have a very short temper and she 's trying to wind me up			0
she 's not going to do it because i know her game - i 'm not going to get wound up			0
' the nanny has cited the weather , the media and physical disabilities as the reasons she has n't moved out of her former employers ' home , but said she will be out this week			2
in an email sent this weekend to the @entity187 ' lawyer , @entity9 said she tried to move out of the house but there was ' always a bunch of news vehicles right in front of the house			2
the media needs to be completely gone before i continue moving			0
' @entity9 disappeared from the @entity196 ' house last thursday morning and was later discovered in her car outside of a police station on friday			2

' nightmare : @entity9 , 64 , moved into the family 's home in @entity15 , @entity4 , pictured , in march ' i 'm relieved because the past few days she has n’t been here , ' she said			1
' but then that also scares me because i do n’t know when she ’s coming			0
' say i want to go to the grocery store and then she comes , what is she going to do to the house ? what if she comes and burns my house down			0
what if she comes in the middle of the night when i ’m sleeping			0
' @entity47 and her husband @entity211 are heading to her sister ’s wedding in @entity214 on wednesday and have arranged for members of her husband ’s family to move in to guard the house			2

' hiding out : last week she was seen sleeping in her car - but the family lives in fear she will return the saga began in march when @entity9 responded to the family 's @entity68 ad for someone to help around the house and watch the children in exchange for meals and a room			1
a few weeks into being hired , she revealed that she suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , a breathing condition , and all but gave up on work			0
since the story has made headlines , it has emerged that this is not @entity9 's first experience with litigation , she is even listed on @entity4 's @entity252 , which includes those who bring legal action that is frivolous or repetitive			2
the majority of the lawsuits were directed at her own family members , particularly her two sisters , and last year she even attempted to sue her son .			0

in her first interview , @entity9 has said she was overworked by the @entity13 family , who hired her to look after their children
she called mrs @entity47 ' a drama queen ' and likened her to a teenager
a list of demands shows she wants the family to provide her with an air conditioned room , @entity77 and a stocked bathroom
she has also demanded that the family vacate the home all day and provide her with healthy meals - or $ 200 to eat out
the couple are *hoping* she will finally leave their home this week
