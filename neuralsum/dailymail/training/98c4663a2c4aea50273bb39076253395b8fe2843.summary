by @entity0 back in 1987 , @entity1 was travelling to @entity2 by ferry with colleagues			1
enjoying a drink in the bar , 6ft 4in @entity1 was telling a story when he raised his hands in the air			1
his fingers grazed a ceiling tile which disintegrated at his touch			2
captain catastrophe : wherever this man goes , death and disaster follows in his wake			2
@entity1 is a one - man walking calamity ‘ i remember saying , “ blimey , this is n’t very well built			1
the place is falling apart ” , ’ says 52 - year - old @entity1 , a driving instructor from southwest @entity21			1
but he thought nothing more of it until a month later			2
‘ i was at home and a news flash came on the television			2
a ferry had capsized , killing 193 passengers and crew			1
it was the ferry i ’d been on : the @entity32			1
‘ i got a cold shiver , ’ he says			2
‘ i did n’t know what to think , except that this was getting spooky			2
for while it ’s the sort of anecdote that most would dismiss as mere coincidence , it was by no means @entity1 ’s first close call and it certainly was n’t his last			1
the @entity32 sank killing killing 193 passengers and crew			1
captain catastrophe had sailed on it shortly before it sank dubbed ‘ captain catastrophe ’ by his friends , @entity1 is the kind of man who drives through a town only to have it go up in flames the moment he leaves			1
he ’s someone who picks a restaurant for lunch and watches it explode before his eyes			2
he ’s dodged three train crashes , three plane crashes , two @entity60 bombs and four major fires			1
‘ i do n’t know if i ’m the luckiest man , or the unluckiest , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ disaster has followed me all my life			2
every time something happens , i think “ blimey , not again ”			2
it ’s getting to the point where people say @entity67 every time i walk into the pub , ’ he jokes			2
his lucky unlucky streak started as a child			2
on a school trip to @entity75 in @entity76 , aged 11 , @entity1 and his schoolmates arrived at their destination only to find they ’d been left dozens of phone messages from worried parents			1
the train directly after theirs had crashed			2
a year later , on a school trip to @entity84 the same thing happened — the train behind them crashed in the tunnel			2
‘ if i ’d have known how things were going to play out , i ’d have gone straight to church and doused myself in holy water , ’ he says			2
since then @entity1 seems to have been on a mission to prove that , far from having the proverbial nine lives , he has 99			1
in 1992 , mr @entity1 had lunch with his ex-wife and a friend at the @entity97 , in @entity99 s @entity98			1
the following lunchtime the @entity60 blew it up , killing one person and injuring five others in 1992 , he had lunch with his ex-wife and a friend at the @entity97 , in @entity21 ’s @entity98			1
the following lunchtime the @entity60 blew it up , killing one person and injuring five others			1
three years later , in 1995 , @entity1 was having flying lessons at @entity106			1
the day after his lesson he opened the paper to see his instructor and another pupil had been killed — in the same plane he ’d flown in			1
there had been complete engine failure , just one hour after he ’d climbed out of the aircraft			2
this is n’t the only close call @entity1 has had in the skies			1
travelling to @entity118 the plane he was flying in narrowly missed landing on top of another plane , which had received erroneous information from air control ; while above @entity124 he flew so close to another aircraft that it skimmed the plane ’s wing			1
the year after his close call at @entity106 , he was working for a motorcycle courier company delivering a package to a company in @entity21 ’s @entity133 before going home			1
the scene after an @entity60 bomb explosion at @entity137 in @entity133			1
captain catastrophe missed that bomb by about 20 minutes by the time he got home an @entity60 bomb had destroyed the very same building he delivered the parcel to , killing two and causing £ 100 million worth of damage			1
‘ i missed that bomb by about 20 minutes — the same thing happened with the @entity152 helicopter crash ( in january last year a helicopter collided with the jib of a construction crane , killing the pilot and one pedestrian )			1
i ’d been right there ten minutes earlier			2
it makes you think , ’ he says with masterful understatement			2
but what on earth does it make him think ? the litany of disasters which have dogged @entity1 read like a @entity166 film script			1
how does he get his head around the fact that death follows him everywhere ? ‘ sometimes i feel as if somebody ’s trying to get me — i might have been @entity171 in another life , ’ he jokes			0
‘ i do n’t know if it ’s bad karma that so much stuff happens around me , or good karma that ’s keeping me alive			0
‘ if i was of a more paranoid nature i ’d lock myself up in a little shed and promise not to come out until the second coming			0
i ’m not religious at all , but maybe i should be … ’ he says he relies on black humour to get him through , but that he feels a level of responsibility for the accidents which follow in his wake			0
‘ every time i ’m close to another disaster i honestly think : “ if i ’d stayed at home would this have happened ? ” he says			0
investigators work at the scene of a helicopter crash in @entity152 , central @entity21			0
a helicopter crashed into a crane on top of one of @entity196 's tallest residential blocks killing two people as it burst into flames ‘ i wish it was funny and slapstick but there ’s real tragedy and i feel bad and think about it a lot , but what can you do ? ’ indeed , if he ’d stayed at home , perhaps the @entity209 restaurant in @entity210 , @entity211 , would still be standing			1
@entity1 and his then - wife were visiting the town in 2006 and were looking for a spot of lunch when they happened upon the @entity209			1
they looked at the menu and @entity1 wanted to go in but his wife insisted they walk further into town to eat			1
they were just 200 yards down the road when she told him to turn around			0
the restaurant was in flames			0
there ’d been a gas explosion in the kitchen			0
the chef lost his arm			0
‘ i just said : “ for crying out loud … ” and my wife said : “ oh , for @entity234 ’s sake			0
” we were both so used to it at that stage			0
’ ‘ almost all the bad things happen when i ’m on holiday , ’ he says			0
‘ so anyone who travels with me has raised eyebrows and a sense of “ bring it on ”			0
but , actually , people travel with me because they know they ’ll be safe			0
nothing actually happens to me or the people with me , we all miss disaster			0
’ take the time in 2010 when @entity1 and his ex-wife flew to @entity250 for a holiday			1
they drove from the airport to the centre of town , where they went to a bar for lunch			0
everybody was looking up at the telly and watching ‘ an orange glow ’			0
‘ the little town by the airport , the one we ’d driven through an hour earlier , was on fire			0
the gas mains had ruptured , killed 50 people , ’ says @entity1			1
driving instructor @entity1 of south @entity21 is followed by death and disaster wherever he goes a couple of years later , on another trip to @entity211 , @entity1 found somebody in his seat			1
‘ i ’d paid for extra leg room but there was an old man in my seat			0
i left him there and took the seat next to him instead			1
‘ next thing i know his wife , sitting the other side of him , is screaming			0
the old boy was slumped over and completely grey			0
the air hostess called out for doctor and one came and dragged him down the aisle where they resuscitated him			0
now every time i book a flight i think of what might happen			0
’ but that does n’t stop him			0
‘ i live for my holidays , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m never going to be someone that just sits around			0
’ and does he worry for the future ? that his 99 lives might be up soon ? ‘ i ’m an eternal optimist , despite all the carnage around me			0
i do live life to the full and i live life for now , that ’s the kind of person i ’ve always been			0
i ’m not scared of dying but i do n’t want to , ’ he says			0
yet there are some areas of his life which seem immune from this strange disastrous streak			0
he has never been involved in a car crash , for example			0
which is just as well , as he now works as a driving instructor			1
does he tell his pupils what they ’re letting themselves in for ? ‘ it ’s not my opening gambit , ’ he laughs			0
‘ but sometimes it comes out and their mouth drops open and they go quite pale			0
i think it makes them pass their test more quickly — they want to get out , sharpish ! ’ and what about any more travel ? has he got holidays booked ? ‘ i ’m going to @entity328 in july , ’ he says			1
you ’ve been warned .			0

@entity1 , 52 , sailed on the @entity32 - just before it sank
he visited a building in @entity133 hours before @entity60 blew it up killing two
his flying instructor and another pupil died soon after he left the plane
he 's going to @entity328 in july . be **afraid** , be very **afraid**
