@entity0 says he is signing for @entity1 because they ' are one of the greatest clubs in the world '			1
the @entity6 striker has long been expected to join @entity8 's side in a £ 32million deal and the 25 - year - old has revealed the move is close to being completed			1
' why would i have chosen to play for @entity1 ? it is a thing that is about to happen , ' @entity0 told @entity14			1
' things are going in a direction and , if they keep going as they are going , it is the team i will play for in the next season			2
@entity1 are one of the greatest clubs of the world so there are many factors that make you take a decision like this			0
' @entity0 , who is currently at the @entity47 with @entity20 , scored 36 goals in all competitions last season to help @entity6 win @entity51 and reach the @entity53 final			1
but he admitted it will take time for him to adapt to @entity57 football			0
he said : ' every year is a different story , nothing is easy in life			2
i will have to work a lot to fit in with the style of the @entity37			2
' having chosen to play for @entity20 over his native @entity65 , @entity0 was booed by local fans during @entity20 's 5 - 1 defeat to @entity68 but says the criticism does not affect him			1
humbled : @entity0 sprints past @entity68 's @entity70 during @entity20 's 5 - 1 defeat to @entity68 last week going down : @entity0 wins a penalty after a challenge from @entity74 ( right ) he has also backed the reigning world champions to bounce back from last friday 's thrashing			1
he said : ' in @entity20 it happens to me in every stadium i play so i 'm pretty much accustomed to it			1
i had my right of choice so it 's the same for the public , they have the right to choose to boo me			0
when you are on the pitch you do n't think about those things			0
i saw it coming , i knew it was going to happen so i had my head ready for that			0
' it was a tough loss [ but ] a match like this happens here and then			0
there is a positive side which is that we still have a chance so we have to keep our heads up because there are two finals to be played			0
there is nothing better than a next match to try to forget this one			0
