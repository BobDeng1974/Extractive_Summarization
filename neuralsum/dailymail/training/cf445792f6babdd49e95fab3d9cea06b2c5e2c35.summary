by @entity0 published : 08:18 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 13 december 2013 a heart - shaped island that became a lovers ' favourite now looks like a perfect destination for the romantically desolate after two strips of forest were bulldozed - leaving scars that look like sticking plasters			1
@entity11 - known locally by the more prosaic name of @entity13 - is located in the @entity14 , off the coast of the popular tourism destination of @entity17			1
the uninhabited island caused a stir several years ago when eagle - eyed @entity21 users realised that it looked like a clumsily scrawled heart			1
broken - hearted : @entity11 - known locally by the more prosaic name of @entity26 - looks rather forlorn after bulldozers scraped two huge strips across			0
the island 's owners plan to plant olive groves there , and maybe build a chapel , so that it is more accommodating for weddings and holidaymakers but a new picture from @entity40 's @entity39 1 satellite - incidentally taken just around @entity41 this year - shows @entity11 looking rather more forlorn after bulldozers carved swathes across it that look like two giant bandages			1
but the island 's owner , @entity46 , vowed that the heart - break was only temporary , and that the bulldozed strips are destined to become groves of olive trees			1
' i will plant olive trees and the island will be more beautiful than before , ' he told @entity17 news site @entity56 , adding that he had been asked many times to organise weddings there but had been unable to because of the mess			1
mr @entity46 said he plans to plant 250 new trees on the island and also to restore its pier , which was built 80 years ago by his grandfather			2
' it is certain that we will soon have a wedding on the island , ' he said			2
he added that interest in his island had increased since reports emerged claiming that @entity73 was linked to the purchase of another £ 12.2million heart - shaped island in the @entity76 ' we tried offering @entity41 trips there but of course that 's only once a year and it was n't really that profitable , ' said mr @entity46			2
' but since reports about the apparent interest of @entity73 in the 11 - acre @entity76 island of @entity85 , we have realised thanks to all the phone calls we have been getting that there is a lot of potential for our island to be used as a wedding destination			1
' how it was : the uninhabited island caused a stir several years ago when eagle - eyed @entity21 users realised that it looked like a clumsily scrawled heart the problem is that despite the romantic appearance from the air , in reality the island is covered in rocks and surrounded by a rocky beach - making access difficult for the average bride in a wedding dress and very difficult for wedding photographs			1
just 130,000 square yards in area , @entity110 is located in the @entity14 's @entity113 channel , between the islands of @entity113 and the coastal town of @entity116 now following the massive interest , mr @entity46 has managed to get funding to develop the island and the bulldozers have moved in to level broad strips on the surface to make way for a grove of olive trees , to be planted and to improve the jetty to allow wedding parties to land			1
he said : ' in future it will be possible to have great photographs on the ground as well as from the air , and because it 's an island it 's very private			0
people can be as loud as they want			0
it 's the perfect desert island			0
' the building work was discovered when @entity21 updated its image showing two massive scars across the heart - shaped island , but mr @entity46 insisted they would soon heal and leave the island with a healthy green foliage that he hoped would eventually extend across the rest of the island			2
although they may build a chapel , there are no plans to offer anything more complicated in terms of accommodation			0
mr @entity46 added : ' people can stay the night , but they have to bring their own boat and moor up at the jetty			0
in theory that means we can accommodate as many people as want to come			0
' just 130,000 square yards in area , @entity26 is located in the @entity14 's @entity113 channel , between the islands of @entity113 and the town of @entity116 on mainland @entity17			1
one of the world 's few naturally occurring love heart - shaped objects , its unusual geography was first recorded in the early 19th century by @entity170 's cartographer @entity169			0
he included it in his 1806 atlas of the @entity174 , kept today at the @entity175 in @entity176 , but it came to global attention in february 2009 when it was highlighted by @entity21			1
mr @entity46 and his family were subsequently swamped with requests from smitten holidaymakers who wanted to spend a romantic break there			0
@entity184 told news agencies at the time that the response had been ' incredible '			0
' we think it is the most perfect heart - shaped island in the world			0
nobody lives there so if lovers really do want to spend time alone it 's the perfect desert island , ' he said			0
' we always thought it looked a bit like a heart but since it 's been on @entity21 everyone else has seen it too and the whole world seems to want to stay here			2

owner says he has cleared land on the island in order to plant olive groves to make it a beautiful wedding destination
the island off @entity17 's @entity14 coast first came to global attention when it was highlighted on @entity21 in 2009
