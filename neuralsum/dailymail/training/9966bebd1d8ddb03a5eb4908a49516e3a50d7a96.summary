by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 05:07 est , 12 october 2012 a new browser add - on offers users an estimate of how much ' free ' internet services like @entity5 and @entity6 are making from their personal data			2
just released for the @entity10 and @entity11 browsers , @entity8 scans users ' @entity5 and @entity6 accounts and shows how they are tracking and sharing your online activities to make money			1

' we wanted people to understand , it is a value exchange , ' said the program 's creator @entity26			0
not free , not at all : a new browser add - on gives users an estimate of how much money @entity6 and @entity5 are making from gathering and trading their personal data to make its estimate , @entity8 measures users ' past 60 days of activity on @entity5 , extrapolates that to a year , then uses a value - per - search estimate			1
mr @entity26 , founder of @entity40 , an online privacy campaign , admits the estimates are rough , but added that the function is mainly there to help users understand the quid pro quo involved with the uses of the services			1
while @entity6 and @entity5 do not charge for access , both companies - as well as many other internet firms - make their money by taking their users ' data and selling it on to advertisers			2
mr @entity26 says his estimated annual @entity6 value was just $ 1.68 , but says his daughter 's worth to the company was a rather more significant $ 12			0
his value to @entity5 was significantly higher , at more than $ 700 a year			0
as well as giving these estimates , @entity8 scans users ' @entity5 and @entity6 privacy settings to highlight which need to be changed to indicate that you do n't want your personal data shared with other companies			1
the extension then takes you to each site to make fixes , explaining the pros and cons of each change in clear , direct language			2
' default privacy settings on sites like @entity6 are revenue - driven , not privacy - driven , ' mr @entity26 said			1
' @entity8 puts you back in control of your data			1
' how private is your @entity6 profile ? the service also takes users through the privacy settings of @entity5 and @entity6 showing which ones need to be changed to indicate that they do n't want their data to be shared the application promises to block tracking by over 1,000 sites , paying particular attention to @entity6 and @entity5			1
it was developed with input from several hundred testers who helped with developing the user interface			0
@entity94 , mr @entity26 's organisation , helps some one million people track their privacy with a range of apps and services			1
on the @entity40 blog , he warns : ' at least 1,200 companies now profile what you do across websites for ads and marketing			2
' social networks have managed to plant widgets everywhere that collect data about what you read and where you go			0
' anybody can target ads to you using your email address , fueling a robust business in matching your email to characteristics like your income level and your politics			0
' marketers now use ip addresses to link what you do on your phone with what you do on your laptop			0
' you are being watched : @entity8 also promises to block tracking by over 1,000 other sites reviews of the @entity133 app were largely positive			1
@entity135 writer @entity134 described the application 's initial scan as ' eye - opening '			0
users of mobile devices are rejecting or uninstalling some apps because of concerns about how much personal and private information is collected , a @entity140 survey has shown the @entity147 survey found that 54 per cent of mobile users who download apps have decided to not install an app when they discovered how much personal information they would need to share in order to use it			2
additionally , 30 per cent of app users have uninstalled an app that was already on their phone because they learned it was collecting personal information that they did not want to share			2
the survey came amid growing concern among lawmakers and civil liberties groups that personal information may be collected by phones and other mobile devices , often without their knowledge			0
' i had manually gone through my @entity6 privacy settings earlier this year , amping up my privacy and deleting apps i did nâ€™t use anymore , ' he wrote			1
' @entity176 showed me that many of the apps had been reactivated on @entity6 and several @entity6 privacy settings - including the one that allows @entity6 to use my likes in advertising - had reverted back to less - private settings			1
' it told me that @entity6 tracks on a whopping 86 per cent of the sites i have visited and makes , on average , about 16 cents per year on ads at my level of activity			0
' @entity188 , reviewing the app for @entity190 , who claimed to be a ' minimal user of @entity6 ' said he was nonetheless surprised to find the social network tracked him across 87 per cent of the internet			0
' @entity8 has a checklist for @entity6 privacy settings , with orange warning signs near settings that users might want to take a look at , ' he said			1
' unless you 're a complete privacy hawk already - or you do n't care at all - you 'll probably find something new on that list that you were n't aware of			0

@entity8 also helps users to change their profile settings for more privacy
