by @entity0 this restless black bear cub clearly struggled to find the perfect spot for his afternoon nap as he refused to sit still and wriggled around on the branch of a maple tree			1

nap time : this restless bear cub refused to sit still and wriggled around on a tree branch when he was supposed to be having a nap comfortable ? @entity19 wildlife photographer @entity18 , 38 , captured these images while she was watching the family relax at @entity21 , @entity22 ms @entity18 , of @entity30 , @entity22 , said she took the pictures after spotting a female bear and her two cubs resting in a tree			1
she said : ' black bears spend a great deal of time sleeping - and since it was a warm day and the cubs were safe , the mum decided it was time for a nap			0
' the mum slept most of the time i was there , but one of the cubs seemed very restless			2
' the little guy kept waking up , scratching and looking at me before finding another position to lie down			0
' the cub seemed so curious and although he was tired , he seemed to be trying to stay awake			0
' standing 20 feet away from the tree , ms @entity18 was able to observe the cub for two hours as he constantly changed his position in a bid to get comfortable			2
restless : ms @entity18 said the bear cub ' kept waking up , scratching and looking at me before finding another position to lie down ' curious : the photographer said the cub ' seemed so curious and although he was tired , he seemed to be trying to stay awake ' black bear cubs remain close to their mother until the age of two or four years old			1
during this time they learn crucial survival techniques , such as where to find food , how to hunt and defend themselves , as well as where to den. ms @entity18 said : ' this was such a special sighting for me and i could n't help laughing at the cub 's antics as he sat 15 feet above me			2
' however , when photographing the moment i did feel very aware of my surroundings , since there were other bears in the area			0
growing up : black bear cubs remain close to their mother until the age of two or four years old , during which time they learn crucial survival techniques , such as where to find food and how to hunt and defend themselves ' it was important to know where i needed to move to once the bears climbed down the tree			1
you definitely want to make sure that you are not between a bear and her cubs			2
' black bears can move much faster than we can so the key to photographing them safely is to watch for signs that they are nervous and leave when that happens			0
' although , honestly , i worry more about the safety of the bears than my own			0
so many interactions between predators and people in @entity22 end up with the predator being shot			0
