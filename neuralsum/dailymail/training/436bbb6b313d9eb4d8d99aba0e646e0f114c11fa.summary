by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 02:04 est , 15 august 2012 it is only because of a sturdy laptop that @entity3 is here to tell her tale			1
only five years ago , having just completed her first year at @entity6 , the media studies undergraduate went under the wheels of a lorry whose driver did n't spot her or her moped on a roundabout			2
@entity3 , who lives in west @entity13 , remembers very little after turning around to see the lorry , hearing a loud crack , then feeling the sensation of ' being squeezed very , very hard around the middle - like two huge people hugging me '			1
@entity3 , founder of @entity20 cycling tour company , heads off on her bicycle upon waking in hospital , @entity3 realised that the crack had been the laptop in her backpack being crushed - and that the bear - hug was the lorry 's wheel rolling over her body			1
' i was pretty lucky , really , ' she tells @entity30			0
' if my laptop had n't been there that crack would have been my spine			0
' told she might never walk again , @entity3 spent three months in hospital , underwent 15 operations on her pelvis and legs , and endured a year of intense rehab			1
she eventually fought her way back onto her feet , but while walking was still immensely painful , the @entity41 student discovered that cycling was not			2
' i could just cycle forever , ' she says			2
' and all of a sudden i was pleased to be in my body rather than frustrated			0
' @entity3 set up @entity20 after being hit by a lorry while on a moped and told she would never walk again returning to @entity6 to complete her degree , @entity3 quickly became a cycling fanatic , even encouraging her two brothers @entity50 and @entity52 ( plus their dad ) back into the saddle			1
' suddenly the three of us were always on our bikes , spending our summers cycling around the country and even @entity60 for as long as our money would allow			2
' we 're all big on music so began cycling to music festivals , and when we got there everyone we met and told was really keen to join in - and suddenly we saw a business opportunity			1
' and so @entity20 was born			1
using @entity69 free website builder @entity67 , @entity3 had a fully - functioning website just two days later and £ 100 lighter			1
charging around £ 25 per cyclist per trip , @entity3 and her brothers lead groups of people to music festivals such as @entity77 all over the country - all on two wheels			1
@entity3 and her brothers @entity52 and @entity50 set up their @entity20 website with the help of free website builders @entity67 ' the trips are such fun and a terrific bonding experience			1
they 've become a great way of meeting like - minded people and making friends			0
' if it 's a small trip , say to @entity92 for a weekend , we tell people to pack light panniers			0
otherwise - like on the weekend when we took 30 people to @entity96 in the @entity97 - we have a support van carrying all our backpacks			0
' and we always cycle alongside a train line , just in case anything goes wrong and we need to get on			2
not that anything ever has gone wrong ! ' on the way home after the festival we tend to put the bikes in the van and get the train home because we 're all exhausted			0
' some keen people start out saying they want to cycle home too , but they always end up changing their minds after the festival ! ' an excited @entity20 tour group set off on their journey towards a music festival being a seasonal operation , @entity3 currently tutors during the winter months , but hopes to turn @entity20 into a full - time operation by next year - and possibly expand to festivals in southern hemisphere countries with opposing seasons , to enable trips all year round			1
' we 'll make just under a £ 10,000 turnover this year , almost £ 7,000 profit , but that also includes a bit of merchandising - having jumpers made up and selling them to people on the tour			0
' i 've been really frugal though and not spent any money on advertising , but what 's also been good about my website builder @entity67 is that as well as being really easy to use they also give you £ 100 of free advertising on @entity142 and @entity143 which teaches you about online marketing			0
' three members of a @entity20 tour group finally reach their festival destination @entity3 is now hoping that the successes of @entity150 's cyclists at the @entity151 will encourage more brits onto bicycles			1
' it 's really important that we address cycle safety , too			1
i mean , having soft , fleshy cyclists on roads alongside massive heavy lorries is never going to be a good idea			0
' we need to split up cyclists and cars , like they do in @entity163 and @entity164 , so it would be great if the @entity166 put some pressure on changing the infrastructure of the road system			2
' luckily , even after the accident , i do n't ever feel scared on my bike in @entity13			0
' the only time i get a little antsy is when i 'm on my bike on a busy road and a truck overtakes			0
when its wheels are eye level and it wobbles and makes loud noises by stomach turns a bit			0
' i still think about the accident every now and then - i had my last operation only in september so it 's still very much a part of my life - but weirdly i think the driver of the lorry was more cut up about it than i was ! ' i met him soon afterwards and he was a really sweet guy			0
he was having terribly insomnia			0
i lost his number but i 'd really like to see him , tell him about @entity20 , let him know how well i 'm doing and show him that it all turned out alright in the end			2
' for more information about @entity3 's festival bike rides , visit @entity197 after four days of exhausting festival fun , most cyclists on @entity3 's @entity20 tours choose to put their bicycles in the support van and get the train home			1

*londoner* @entity3 , *26* , organises group rides to festivals with @entity20
she hopes the @entity166 will spark a *resurgence* in cycling and cycle safety
