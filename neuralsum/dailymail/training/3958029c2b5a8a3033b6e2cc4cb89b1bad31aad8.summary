@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity7 fixtures			2
@entity9 ’s performance at @entity10 was so bad that they ended up trying to play @entity10 at what used to be their own game of lumping long balls			1
@entity16 dropped deeper and deeper trying to aim for @entity17 and @entity18 , attempting eight long passes in the second half – more than any other @entity9 outfield player			1
the @entity22 also attempted more crosses than @entity10 – 27 against the home side 's 23			1
@entity9 players look dejected after conceding a third goal against @entity10 at the @entity27 on saturday 2			1
if banging in crosses is part of a new @entity9 philosophy they will be grateful to @entity31 for the way @entity33 has been converted into an attacking full back during his loan at @entity36			1
the 22 - year - old , who earned one @entity39 cap as a sub in a friendly against @entity42 in 2012 , fired in 10 crosses , including the one from which @entity45 scored the first of his two goals in the 3 - 1 win over @entity49			1
he ’s attempted 57 crosses in 12 games as a @entity52 this season , an average of 4.75 per match			1
in his 14 @entity4 appearances for the @entity22 last year his average was 2.4			0
@entity31 's @entity33 controls the ball against @entity49 at @entity36 3			1
@entity59 have stumbled on a central defensive pairing to take them forward if they ca n’t keep @entity62 away from the clutches of @entity64 in january			1
in four games since @entity66 and @entity67 were flung together to solve an injury crisis , @entity59 have now conceded just three times			1
against @entity70 they made 27 clearances between them , with @entity74 centre half @entity67 winning 100 per cent of his tackles			1
@entity59 's @entity66 ( left ) celebrates with @entity67 after scoring the equaliser against @entity70 4			1
@entity77 will be suspended from @entity79 ’s trip to @entity9 next weekend but should be the first name on @entity82 ’s teamsheet when @entity83 arrive at @entity84 for the @entity86 derby on december 21			1
the 28 - year - old @entity87 has started only six games this season after falling out of favour with @entity82 – but ending @entity91 ’s unbeaten record means the @entity92 have won every single one of them			1
@entity77 ( left ) is sent off by referee @entity93 ( centre ) at @entity84 on saturday 5			1
@entity95 might be keen to point out a similar statistic to @entity98 boss @entity97 after being dumped back on the bench until the final seven minutes against @entity100			2
the winger does n’t appear to fit his manager ’s system – but when he does play @entity98 get results			2
the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity91 , when he was hauled off after 58 minutes , was the first time he had been on the losing side of a game he started all season			1

@entity98 's @entity95 comes on for the final seven minutes against @entity100 6			0
@entity115 claimed @entity116 should have got a red card for catching @entity118 with a kung - fu style kick			2
whatever the rights and wrongs of referee @entity124 ’s decision there ’s no doubt that @entity116 has still got problems finding the correct composure to bring his physical style of play in tune with the @entity4			2
the £ 32m @entity133 defender has now picked up four yellow cards and one red in his nine domestic games since signing for @entity137 from @entity138 in the summer			2

since the 35 - year - old got back into the team @entity158 have won 10 points from eight games			1
@entity147 centre half @entity145 makes a clearance during the match against @entity153 on saturday 8			0
@entity164 ’s promotion efforts are benefiting from a bit of father - and - son work between boss @entity167 and his son @entity168			0
@entity169 is in charge of under 21 recruitment at @entity172 , and was the man responsible for targeting @entity175 youngster @entity174 to sign on a season - long loan			1
the @entity178 - born defensive midfielder has taken time to settle in @entity39 , but was excellent in the 3 - 0 win over @entity181 that kept the @entity182 at the top of the championship			2

the 62 - year - old house building multi-millionaire clearly did n’t learn any lessons about letting his passions boil over			0

@entity205 , demoted from the @entity4 list for booking @entity212 instead of giving him a penalty , had sent off @entity192 stars @entity214 and @entity216			0
@entity192 chairman @entity191 ( right ) confronts referee @entity205 after the final whistle on saturday 10			0
one of the sores that never healed between @entity219 and @entity220 was over which club was entitled to wallow in the @entity7 history of the @entity224 ’s 1988 triumph over @entity200			0
fitting , then , that in the week that the controversial documentary remembering that epic achievement had its premiere the club the fans launched after seeing their own hijacked should manage its own @entity7 milestone			0
