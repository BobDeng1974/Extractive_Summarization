@entity15 's @entity14 was at the @entity16 to run the rule over both sets of teams ... @entity1 ( right ) celebrates after his 15th minute goal gave the @entity9 an early lead @entity4 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity22 6 entirely redundant until terrific save to deny @entity23 before the interval and barely tested again before @entity12 ’s goal			1
@entity26 7 good pace and got forward well			2
one great first - half diagonal run and set up @entity1 ’s second			1
booked for an innocuous tap on @entity31			2
@entity32 7 settled well at centre - half and surprisingly strong in the air against @entity35			0
@entity4 defender @entity26 ( right ) showed good pace and got forward often against the @entity36 per mertesacker 6.5 hit the bar early on but the captain will have been disappointed his defensive unit leaked a soft - goal from a free - kick			1
@entity42 6.5 combined well with @entity43 on the left			0
defended well and went close with volley slammed into the side - netting			0
@entity47 6 @entity4 wobbled briefly for five minutes either side of half - time but were mostly in control and he was n’t tested greatly @entity9 forward @entity51 ( right ) controls possession as @entity53 watches on @entity51 7.5 the usual powerball performance			1
strong and dangerous out wide or through the centre			0
delivered the cross for @entity1 ’s first goal			1
@entity58 7 terrific energy and changes of pace			0
this formation gives @entity4 so much in attack but little help for @entity65 shielding defence			1
@entity2 7.5 not everything came off for him on his 30th birthday but scored with a delicious chip from a tight angle and added the fourth with a @entity73 penalty			1
@entity2 bagged a brace for the @entity9 including a superbly taken late penalty at the @entity16 @entity43 7 effective and threatened goal , even from wide on left			1
had one harshly disallowed and volleyed another just wide			0
@entity1 8 majestic header to open scoring and his link - up play was excellent			1
also won important headers in his own box			0

@entity12 goalkeeper @entity100 struggled on his first start between the posts @entity12 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 @entity103 4.5 a day to forget for the 21 - year - old on his first start			1
seemed nervous , hesitant and barely protected against @entity4 ’s rampaging attackers			1
early goal only added to anxieties			2
@entity109 5 overwhelmed at times by the speed and movement of @entity4 ’s attacking players and barely able to support in attack			1
@entity114 6 made some key tackles but his defence simply could not cope with @entity1 and the runners around him			1
@entity114 ( right ) made some key tackles but struggled to cope with the pace of @entity4 's attack @entity121 5.5 also suffered against a fluent attacking force and did not look comfortable all game			1
@entity124 6 quick , committed and aggressive , although he struggled to contain @entity51 and conceded a penalty with a foul on @entity43			2
@entity127 5 lucky to avoid an early red for studs - up follow through into @entity51 midriff after five minutes			0
booked later for chopping down the @entity131			0
@entity127 was fortunate not to be sent off early in the contest after his reckless tackle on @entity51 @entity53 6.5 good passing and dead - ball delivery			0
his midfield consistency must be one of the few positives to take back to @entity140			2
@entity141 5 moved around into different positions but made no impact until after the substitutions , when he scored with header from @entity53 free - kick			2
@entity35 4.5 dominated in air by @entity32 while in centre			0
worked hard when on the left but offered little going forward and hooked after less than an hour			2
@entity12 's @entity35 heads clear under pressure from @entity58 @entity23 5 in for suspended @entity152			2
header forced a good save from @entity154 and a scramble but otherwise rarely involved			2
@entity156 4 seven in the @entity8 before this but entirely anonymous			0
few chances and link - up play poor			0
@entity85 : @entity160 ( for @entity35 56 ) @entity161 ( for @entity162 ) , @entity163 ( for @entity164 ) @entity89 : @entity165 , @entity163 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity94 : @entity127 , @entity169			0
