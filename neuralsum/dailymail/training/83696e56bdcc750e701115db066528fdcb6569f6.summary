by @entity0 primary schools were yesterday urged to bring shakespeare ’s plays to pupils as young as five in the hope they will ‘ catch the bug ’ early			1
@entity7 , artistic director of the @entity8 , said that children should see historical dramas as well as works such as @entity12 , often seen as more accessible			1
he believes the language should not be simplified for younger audiences			0
wide - eyed faces : the @entity8 has said @entity15 in its original form , such as the recent @entity17 starring @entity18 , can connect with primary school children however , he admitted education secretary @entity21 will ‘ probably guffaw ’ at the idea			1
the national curriculum states that pupils should study two @entity15 plays between the ages of 11 and 14 , but makes no mention of primary schools			1
mr @entity7 said children could be captivated by abridged versions of @entity15 long before they start secondary school , when they may come to regard them as difficult or boring			1
he is due to meet education secretary @entity21 to talk about the @entity8 ’s work in primary schools , but predicted mr @entity21 would ‘ probably guffaw ’			1
‘ you have to let the bug bite before kids get cynical , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
‘ letting them get involved when they are 13 is much harder than getting to kids earlier , without all the prejudices and stresses and strains of the idea that @entity15 is somehow difficult or boring or academic			2
‘ what @entity15 is brilliant at is speaking to a lot of audiences at the same time and we can appreciate it on many different levels			0
and it does n’t just have to be @entity50 or @entity12			0
’ mr @entity7 told the @entity51 he recalled being ‘ grabbed by the stories ’ as a child before becoming engaged by @entity15 ’s language as he grew up			1
reaction : the @entity8 said that even abridged versions of @entity15 in schools produced ' dramatic ' results ‘ but it ’s more than just good stories and nice language , ’ he added			2
‘ it ’s about ethics and morality			0
’ the education secretary has pledged to extend the study of @entity15 ’s works in state schools as part of an ‘ unashamedly elitist ’ approach			2
mr @entity21 has said keeping the ‘ amazing intellectual achievements of our ancestors ’ from children amounts to ‘ stealing from their rightful inheritance , condemning them to a future poorer than they deserve ’			2
but while he has backed a scheme to introduce young children to @entity15 , it focuses on @entity85 themes in other areas of the curriculum rather than the plays themselves			1
but mr @entity7 said exposing younger children to the plays would capture a new generation of converts			1
meeting : @entity8 artistic director @entity7 , left , is due to meet education secretary @entity21 , right , to discuss bringing more of the company 's works to schools , but experts mr @entity21 will ' guffaw ' at his plans the @entity8 said it saw dramatic results when it performed abridged versions of plays in @entity15 ’s original language in primary schools			1
recently its production of @entity17 , starring @entity18 , was streamed to more than 7,000 primary school children around the country			0
at a school in @entity111 where it was shown to a class of seven - year - olds , the teacher wrote : ‘ about 20 minutes into the performance , as i looked around at all the wide - eyed little faces looking up toward the screen , i thought i was going to cry			0
‘ as one child in @entity120 said , “ @entity117 , is this for real ? ” ’ @entity121 , director of education at the @entity8 , said : ‘ even for the youngest children , it is all @entity15 ’s language			2
‘ they are never , ever working with translation			0
they do n’t want to be patronised			0
‘ when you ’re at primary school , nobody has told you @entity15 is difficult			0
the earlier we start with children , the more is possible			0
‘ and there is n’t a play that you ca n’t do			0

artistic director @entity7 said even young children can *benefit*
said the young can be *enthused* as they do *n't* think @entity15 is ' boring '
mr @entity7 believes the 16th - and 17th - century texts should not be simplified
he will meet @entity21 to discuss working more in primary schools
@entity21 has spoken of desire to extend @entity15 study
but mr @entity7 believes that he may ' guffaw ' at his *proposals*
