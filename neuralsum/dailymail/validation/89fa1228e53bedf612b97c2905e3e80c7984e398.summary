a teenager who was searching for her missing pet was relieved when she was told someone had found the dog and taken it to the vet , only to find out the animal had been put down			1
@entity6 , 18 , put an appeal on @entity8 when her @entity9 sneaked out of the garden of her family home in @entity12 , and disappeared			1
her despair initially turned to joy when she was told it had been found by a member of the public who took the animal , which had arthritis which makes him drag his back leg , to a vet			1
but she was then told by the vet that they had put @entity9 down because of his condition - without telling his devastated owner first			1
@entity6 said she was distraught after she found her missing dog had been handed in by a member of the public to the vet , only for staff to decide to put the animal down - without informing her first ms @entity6 said : ' @entity9 did have a few health problems , but he was not as bad as the vet said he was			1
' they should n't have just gone ahead and done this without our say - so			0
' after @entity9 , who was 16 - years - old , disappeared he was found by a member of the public and taken to @entity40 in @entity41			1
vets said he was having trouble breathing and within 24 hours he was put to sleep			1
ms @entity6 believes the arthritis in his legs , which caused him to drag his back leg and look ill , was known to the vets after @entity9 was injured in an accident 12 years ago			1
the student added : ' the problems were known to the vet and they said it was completely fine and there was no need to worry			0
' they should have contacted the dog warden at the council to tell them he had been handed in			2
' they could have waited			0
that way , we would have known he had been found - we would have had a point of contact			2
miss @entity6 said her pet had arthritis in his legs , but claimed veterinary staff had known about his condition ' we had no way of knowing he 'd been taken to the vets			1
' homer was not microchipped but ms @entity6 said he had a docked tail and cauliflower ear , making him more distinctive			1
he was also not wearing a collar			2
veterinary staff said they were forced to take action after the @entity82 was found ' thin and experiencing breathing difficulties			1
' a spokeswoman for the practice said staff take their responsibilities to animals very seriously and said it would not have been ethical for them to have admitted such an unwell animal , thought to have been a stray , in such a ' desperate ' condition			1
she added : ' our obligation to stray animals is to provide such emergency treatment and pain relief as is appropriate and we treat many strays each year , before either successfully reuniting them with their owners , or passing them on to the relevant authorities			2
the dog was taken to @entity106 in @entity41 , where the dog was then put down ' @entity9 was brought in on saturday morning by a member of the public			2
we checked our ' lost ' register , in which we record details of missing animals reported to the surgery , but found no matching entry			0
' we did not attempt to contact the dog warden , as we had previously been informed that they did not operate at weekends			0
' the police no longer have legal responsibility for stray dogs and do not maintain a list			0
' the woman said the animal was examined by two veterinary surgeons who found he was agitated and distressed			1
microchipping dogs is to become compulsory by april 2016 , along with ensuring all details stored on the microchip are updated			0
owners who do n't comply can be fined Â£ 500			0
recent research by the @entity131 found that 57 per cent of owners do not realise microchipping will become a legal obligation in 12 months time			2
they also found 46 per cent of @entity137 dog owners do not update their animal 's microchip with address details when they move			1
this is in spite of 22 per cent of owners admitting their dogs strayed within 48 hours of them moving to a new area			0
the @entity131 estimate there are 1,780,000 dogs in the @entity137 who are not microchipped			0
around 72 per cent of dog owners are unaware that they only have seven days to recover a missing dog from a @entity153 before they are rehomed or put to sleep			2
' obviously elderly , he was making clawing , repetitive movements of his front legs , but was unable to stand , even when supported and was barely responsive to his surroundings , ' she added			0
' his lung and heart sounds were muffled and indistinct , he was very thin and was experiencing breathing difficulties			0
' they decided that his condition was terminal and considered his prognosis hopeless			0
' no palliative treatment could have been provided which would have rendered his condition comfortable , and accordingly he was painlessly put down			0
' it is not acceptable , either legally or ethically , for us to admit a stray animal in such a desperate clinical condition to the hospital , in the hope that an owner comes forward			1
' it is always with deep regret that we take this drastic action , which is only done to prevent further suffering , but these few unfortunate animals are put down with a gentle touch and a kind word			0
' his owners have our deepest sympathy			0
