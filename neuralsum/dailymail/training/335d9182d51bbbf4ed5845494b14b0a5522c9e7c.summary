@entity1 's place in @entity2 , @entity3 , is known simply as the ' @entity4 ' , such is its place in the hearts of locals and the hundreds of visitors it attracts			1
@entity1 puts up more than 400,000 lights – he 's lost count – as part of his family 's annual festive celebration covering his house , garden , trees and fences with the colours of @entity19			1
he could n't have predicted that what began with two travel bags full of lights from a @entity23 in the @entity24 on the trip that first inspired him would become an obsession for not just him but those who make the annual pilgrimage to see his handiwork			1
@entity1 's place in @entity2 , @entity3 , is lit up by more than 400,000 lights for @entity19 @entity1 was inspired by a trip to the @entity24 when he was impressed by the residential festive displays ' the idea comes from the year 1999 , ' @entity1 says			1
' we were in @entity24 in december with our son and spent a whole night going round - about eight hours - and looked at the houses			2
there was one more beautiful than the others , and from that came the idea to go straight to @entity23			0
we packed two travel bags full of lights and came back			2
' despite beginning with far fewer lights , visitors started seeking out the ' @entity19 house ' from its very inception , even though @entity1 said the family had originally only put up the display for their own pleasure			1
' one evening my youngest came down and said , " @entity51 , go out , there are ten cars at the door "			0
i go out and wonder what 's going on here			0
" hello , oh , it looks so good , " and so on and so forth , and then they keep saying , " is there bratwurst and mulled wine here ? " i say : " goodness , yes "			2
we had only made it for ourselves the first time round			0
but the idea was already there to make it 5000 lights for the second year			0
' each year his design gets bigger and he sells mulled wine and bratwurst to help meet the costs distributing the wine and sausages goes some way towards funding the lights for @entity1 and family , who pay thousands of euros to keep the place aglow			1
between the illuminated @entity80 , stars and snowflakes , @entity1 says he has lost count of the actual number of lights			1
' [ a ] round 450,000 , maybe a few more , a few less			0
so i do n't know exactly , because i 've only got the giant mountain [ of lights ] , you ca n't count them any more , ' he said			2
@entity92 's sleigh and reindeer shine bright atop @entity1 's house which he starts decorating in july but for the family , @entity1 added , the display is not just a @entity19 project but occupies them year - round			1
' i start at the end of july , cutting down all the shrubs and the lilacs and i gradually begin to display the first things			0
and then it always takes time for me to find the beginning , how i imagine it now , because people want to see it different every year , and when i have the beginning , then it continues bit by bit , then the thoughts of how i build it comes together , ' he said			0
their efforts make the most of the long nights in winter by switching on at 5pm every evening until 9pm , from late november until late december .			0

he was inspired by a trip to the @entity24 and started with two bags of lights
he 's lost count but says there are more than 400,000 lights in his design
selling mulled wine and bratwurst helps pay the thousands it costs to run
