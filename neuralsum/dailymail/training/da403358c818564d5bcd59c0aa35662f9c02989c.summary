a new £ 30million academy has opened directly opposite a seedy sex club , complete with leather - clad clientele , a mock torture wheel and a fully - equipped dungeon			1
@entity5 , which opened this month in @entity6 , county @entity7 , boasts of its state - of - the - art design , with classrooms kitted out with projectors , interactive whiteboards and brand new science labs			1
but its prospectus fails to mention the business just opposite - @entity16 - which describes itself as the best sex club in the north east			1
contrast : newly - opened @entity5 , left , is just across the road from the @entity21 , which houses swingers ' joint @entity16 the club , which appears from the outside to be ' @entity25 ' was subject to vigorous resistance from local residence when its true intentions became apparent in 2004			1
the addition of a school just cross the road has intensified the protests			0
the website - which does not openly disclose the club 's location - lists the club 's facilities , including a dance floor complete with pole , a sauna and steam room , a ' public play area '			1
the underground dungeon is also shown , featuring leather and chains , padded tables and a man - sized wheel to which guests can be strapped			1
the club , which opens from 8pm most evenings , urges its visitors to be discreet , but locals still campaign against the establishment , which they say is ' unsuitable ' for the location , and creates disturbances			2
@entity57 , a member of a local residents ' campaign , said said : ' from day one we feared this would happen			0
what started out as an event on a saturday night at the spa has become a series of party nights on wednesdays , fridays , saturdays and sundays			0
state - of - the - art : @entity16 is just around the corner from the £ 30million @entity5 unassuming : @entity16 does not openly display itself , and urges customer to be discreet ' there are problems with cars parking in the area and visitors leaving in the early hours of the morning are causing a noise disturbance			1
when the windows are open i can hear all sorts			0
' retired factory worker , 66 - year - old grandmother @entity79 , has lived nearby for the past 26 years has noted the exotic visitors to the site			2
she said : ' sometimes the people are dressed up in skirts up to here , both men and women , or pvc or as tarts and vicars but other times you just see them carrying a plastic bag in with them			0
@entity93 : @entity94 and @entity79 have said that @entity16 's presence is ' unsuitable ' in light of the new academy ' some of them look sheepish but others are n’t bothered			1
you hear all kinds of stories			0
' her husband @entity94 said : ' it should be shifted			0
it is one thing if it is on a trading estate in the middle of nowhere , but it should n’t be right next to people ’s homes , on a high street and opposite a school			2
' the club has made efforts to downplay the disruption it causes - members must pay a subscription fee and be over 25 , and the website asks visitors to ' appreciate we wish to stay at the club for the long term and not everyone is as open minded as we all are			1
' the premesis needs no special license , as it does not sell alcohol and also the services it offers do not classify as ' sexual entertainment ' - which means the police and council have no reason to intervene			2
a spokesman for @entity138 said : ' we are not aware of licensing issues surrounding this premises			0
it does n’t have an alcohol license or a sexual entertainment licence that we are aware of			0
' a spokeswoman from @entity146 said : ' it ’s a hotel with themed rooms , bring your own booze policy so it does not need a licence under the licensing act			1
' the county council licensing enforcement people visit regularly to ensure compliance and it fully complies with current legislation			0
' nobody wished to comment from the club			0
a spokeswoman for @entity5 said they did not wish to comment .			2

@entity5 opened this month in @entity6 , county @entity7
it is just across the street from @entity16 , which offers pole - dancing , themed rooms and a sex dungeon
