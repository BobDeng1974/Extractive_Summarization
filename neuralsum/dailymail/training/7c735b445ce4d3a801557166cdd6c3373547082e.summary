the 68 - year - old actress said : ‘ i have a tattoo that means " love they neighbour " – even if your neighbour is as different from you as you can possibly imagine			1
the story of this film is in my tattoo			1
‘ but " love they neighbour " is by far the hardest of the commandments			1
‘ that ’s where real hatred is bred			1
it ’s the guy living next door who cuts the tree down , or the one whose kids scream the whole night			2
‘ your neighbours are as important as your house			2
when you have great ones it ’s incredible – they ’re someone you can leave the key with when you travel			2

‘ about six of us got them at the same time , ’ she added			0
‘ it ’s a kind of mad bonding thing that you do from time to time in your life			0
