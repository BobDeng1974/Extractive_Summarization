@entity4 battle : @entity10 ( left ) , who raped one prostitute and indecently assaulted another in 2000 , claims he was forced to breathe in second - hand smoke in the cells at @entity18 ( right , file picture ) @entity10 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , launched a legal battle from behind bars using taxpayers ’ cash - because he could not afford his own costs - to try to claim compensation from the government			1
he claimed being made to share with the smoker for one week in march 2012 was a ‘ unjustified interference ’ with his right to a private and family life			0
the publicly - funded case against prison operator @entity35 and the @entity36 was dismissed at the @entity4 - but he then appealed the decision			0
yesterday , this was also thrown out by three senior judges at the @entity40			0
mr @entity41 said : ‘ we do not think this appeal gets off the ground - we are not impressed			1
’ location : @entity10 claimed being made to share with the smoker for one week in march 2012 at @entity18 ( pictured ) was a ' unjustified interference ' with his human rights and also invaded his privacy @entity10 was forced to share a cell with a smoker after being moved to another part of the prison because he and other sex offenders were being bullied , the court heard			1
' we do not think this appeal gets off the ground - we are not impressed ' mr @entity41 @entity35 official @entity58 told the court : ‘ this was unfortunate but could not be avoided , given the practical and safety considerations			1
there were limited cells available in the prison , which was overcrowded			0
‘ in order to protect @entity10 from abusive or violent conduct from other prisoners , for a short time he had to share a cell with a vulnerable prisoner who was a smoker			2
’ @entity71 , representing justice secretary @entity72 , said @entity10 ’s accommodation was an operational decision for the prison			2
inside : @entity10 was forced to share a cell with a smoker at @entity18 after being moved to another part of the prison because he and other sex offenders were being bullied , the court heard he added : ‘ temporary exposure to second - hand smoke did not amount to an interference with the right to a private life			1
’ ' this was unfortunate but could not be avoided , given the practical and safety considerations ' @entity58 , @entity35 official @entity10 had also called on the justice secretary to ban smoking in prison cells to ‘ protect ’ the country ’s 85,000 prisoners , but this was also rejected			2
smoking is still allowed in @entity96 ’s prisons despite a national smoking ban in public places being in force for six years			0
challenging the ruling , @entity10 ’s barrister @entity99 said : ‘ prisoners are not in the position where they have some freedom of choice about how to protect their health			2
‘ if i feel strongly about smoking , i can take steps to avoid it			0
what this case demonstrates is that prisoners are not necessarily in that position			0
' habit : the 2007 smoking ban in public places did not apply to prison cells ( file picture ) some 80 per cent of the 84,300 prison service inmates smoke - and tobacco is a valuable currency that is traded on the wings			2
some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour - and ' well - behaved ’ inmates look forward to their cigarette breaks out in the yard to help them through the boredom of their sentences			0
but staff have long objected to breathing in the second - hand smoke of inmates , and there are fears that the @entity118 could face compensation claims from officers who claim that they are victims of passive smoking			1
the 2007 smoking ban designed to protect people from the effects of second - hand smoke in public places did not apply to prison cells			1
last september , it was reported that a pilot was to be launched in some prisons that would ban inmates from smoking in all parts of the jails – including exercise yards			0
but a @entity118 spokesman said there are no plans to ban smoking in jails at the moment .			0
