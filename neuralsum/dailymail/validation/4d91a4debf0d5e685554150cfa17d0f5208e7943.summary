on reflection , it would be wrong to describe inter-squad relations back then as frosty			1
@entity3 might be more appropriate			2
yet the warmth was distinctly a few degrees south of what @entity5 is currently enjoying each time the @entity8 squad gathers on the banks of @entity10			1
the reasons for the dawning of an age of bonhomie are not too hard to fathom			2
in little over two years , @entity15 has transformed the national team from a laughing stock into a source of genuine pride and hope			1
one that people naturally want to be part of			2
awkward conversations between players who would much rather be elsewhere are conspicuous by their absence			2
a sense of togetherness - which can only truly be fostered by a string of positive results and performances - is palpable			1
the @entity32 squad are in high spirits in the lead - up to their clash with @entity36 on wednesday @entity5 says : ' from when i joined the national team to now , it ’s a totally different dynamic ' the old cliché about a club - like atmosphere surrounding @entity32 – for so long just empty rhetoric – now has a solid basis in reality			1
‘ from when i joined the national team to now , it ’s a totally different dynamic in that every single player is chatting away to anybody , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ it ’s just normal			2
we ’re a bunch of guys who are at similar points in life – starting families , getting married but all driven			2
seeing what we have here and what we can do is what ’s driving everyone			2
it ’s great that we ’re all of similar mind - sets and it works			1
‘ ( previously ) i would n’t say it was as tight as it is now			2
everyone was n’t as open as they are now			2
‘ i would n’t say there were cliques and people not talking to each other			2
but the @entity73 boys and the @entity75 boys did tend to stay together			1
it ’s just who you are familiar with			2
‘ now everybody is just a bit more open			2
so many more of us get on and will be texting each other outwith football			2
it just brings people closer			0
’ for much of @entity5 ’s @entity8 career , a call - up to the national side brought mixed emotions for many			1
@entity15 's reign has brought back a sense of pride to the @entity8 shirt at times , the pride of being selected to pull on a dark blue jersey was diminished by a realisation that the team was going nowhere fast			1
frequent numerous call - offs just became the way of things			1
many of those who did assemble for duty wore the look of men who wish they had n’t bothered			0
@entity5 says there are no cliques in the side ‘ most folk will hang about in the communal areas and chill and enjoy banter , ’ he added			1
‘ in the past , people maybe went to their own room or someone else ’s room in twos or threes			0
‘ now you could walk through the hotel and see eight or nine guys mixing – and it ’s always a different mix. ‘ the manager has not directly encouraged it but the way he operates being so open and honest rubs off on the way we behave and work together			0
’ it says much that only @entity129 has withdrawn from @entity15 ’s original party to face @entity36 on wednesday and @entity131 on sunday			1
hardly fixtures that necessitate a dose of tranquillisers to calm the pulse of the @entity136 , but tellingly viewed by the entire squad as matters of the utmost importance			0
‘ it ’s a very good game as we ’ve both started our campaigns very well , ’ @entity5 said of wednesday 's @entity140 friendly			1
‘ it ’s a game with a little more to it , like @entity36 and @entity148 , because they are close to home and the players are all familiar with each other			1
it ’ll be a very good test			0
it ’s an opportunity to try a few things and refresh the minds of what we ’ve been doing because we ’ve not been together for a period or four or five months			0
’ for @entity5 , this match is also a case of @entity161			1
both @entity162 and @entity163 shared a dressing room with him at @entity73 for four years with three @entity166 titles gleaned in that period			1
@entity168 striker @entity163 did n’t have his troubles to seek at @entity170 initially but his latter contributions – together with his current displays for club and country – have long since convinced @entity5 of his value to any side			1
@entity5 will be reunited with friends @entity163 , who who played with during a successful run at @entity73 he will also compete with @entity162 , another former @entity73 star now on the @entity181 books ‘ ever since he was at @entity73 he was been a big player for @entity36 , ’ he said			1
‘ he has scored a few goals for them and he has been their main striker since @entity184			0
he has always been a threat and has matured more as he has grown older			0
‘ he probably lacked a bit of maturity back then , definitely			0
around the changing room he was a great laugh and when times were tough he was always there to keep the boys up , even if he was the brunt of the jokes			0
when he was younger , he probably did n’t know when to stop			0
he has matured more now and speaking to the boys at @entity168 they say he is different now to how he was back then			0
‘ the way he finished seasons ( at @entity73 ) was remarkable			1
at specific times in a season you need players who are going to drag you through games and @entity204 would always pop up at the end of a season			0
’ what @entity207 would currently give for such a lucky charm			1
currently sitting 13th in the @entity210 , last season ’s remarkable run to fifth under @entity213 seems distant , while their @entity215 aspirations were ripped to shreds by @entity217			0
@entity207 's @entity5 and @entity219 - based @entity218 , formerly of @entity73 and @entity75 respectively , share a laugh as they warm up with the @entity32 squad on tuesday typifying how many fans now have the collective memories of goldfish , graffiti denigrating the @entity226 has been seen around @entity227			1
‘ i ’ve seen that , ’ @entity5 admitted			1
‘ to be honest , it ’s very unlike @entity207 fans			1
i think it ’s a very small minority			0
‘ at times this season it ’s been so frustrating for them after the success of last season			0
the way we played then was great and everything was going for us			0
‘ it ’s not nice to see but we definitely believe in what we are doing			0
’ the irony of @entity8 now providing a lift for ailing club players is lost on no one			1
if defeat to @entity148 last time out was a natural disappointment , there was no shortage of understanding given the toil in putting @entity254 to the sword four days previously			0
‘ the last trip was quite tricky , ’ @entity5 recalled			1
‘ there was so much build up on the @entity254 game , the main event , and to get such a good result took such a lot out of the boys			0
‘ in hindsight , everyone was desperate to play against @entity148 … the manager was speaking to a few players to see if they would sit it out , but everyone was dying to play and that probably went against us			0
‘ @entity148 caught us off guard , were on the front foot and pressed us well and took their chances			0
it was difficult for us to take but we are a much more solid unit now with so much confidence for places			0
‘ even @entity278 has come in , who is such a great talent			0
he ’s exactly the type of player who will add something to the squad			0

@entity8 face @entity36 on wednesday and @entity131 on sunday
@entity5 said @entity15 's side is ' in it together ' now
