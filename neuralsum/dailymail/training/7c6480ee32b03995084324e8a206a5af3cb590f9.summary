' the @entity148 connected themselves inseparably with the crimes of the @entity150			0
' the @entity148 were pressured into commissioning the study after a 2007 tv documentary in @entity7 entitled @entity153			0
five days later , as the press headlines about a fortune built on blood piled up , the reclusive family announced its full backing for the research project			0
at the time it said : ' the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us			0
' we recognize that in our history as a @entity7 business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up			2
' @entity3 , of which the @entity148 became major shareholders 15 years after the war , was not implicated in the documentary			0

we were also whipped , ' said @entity172 , a forced labourer who worked in @entity107 's @entity98 plant			2
