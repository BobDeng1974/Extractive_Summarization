she is just five - years - old but already has a following on @entity1 to equal @entity2			1
and thanks to her million followers around the globe , internet sensation @entity3 has swapped a cramped flat with her parents and brother for a @entity13 star 's jetset lifestyle			1
the little girl has been flown business class around the world and showered with presents worth hundreds of thousands of pounds , from @entity19 handbags and @entity21 and @entity22 jewellery to designer outfits , banquets and hampers laden with chocolates and cookies			0
they came for a visit but they decided to stay after her fame took off surprise ! rarely a day goes by when there is not another unexpected gift arriving on her doorstep rarely a day goes by when there is not another surprise gift arriving on her doorstep - all because her mother started posting cute pictures of her online			1
the @entity3 effect snowballed when wealthy , high - profile @entity53 in the @entity53 spotted the cute @entity56 girl 's short videos on the picture sharing website @entity1			1
in them , she dances along to @entity60 , sings along to @entity61 and poses with designer handbags			0
when the @entity53 began reposting her videos six months ago , @entity3 came to the attention of web surfers across the @entity66 , where internet usage is as high as 77 per cent			1
her mother @entity68 , 27 , responded by teaching her phrases in @entity70 gleaned off @entity71 and signing off each video with the @entity70 word ' bosaah ' , meaning kisses , and the fans followed in their droves			0
her wealthy fans in the @entity66 even flew her from her home in @entity35 to @entity30 , where her family has been put up for free in five star hotels since may and chauffeur driven in limos			1
@entity3 's @entity1 followers - who have been joined by an average 60,000 new followers per day - dwarf those of @entity86 , the redheaded @entity87 three - year - old who was dubbed the princess of @entity1 with 90,000 followers , a fraction of the number eager to find out what @entity3 does next			1
five - star : @entity3 and her mother , father and @entity97 her brother , plus a friend			1
@entity97 , aged seven , said : ' i 'm smart but @entity3 is beautiful ' @entity100 and famous : @entity3 's father said she is now treated like a @entity13 actor and recognised everywhere cute : her mother said : ' she has something inside her that makes people love her and makes them happy ' growing : an average 60,000 more people follow @entity3 each day			1
she currently has 1.1m followers she will equal @entity2 within days , who has 1.16m followers , and she is quickly catching up with @entity111 's @entity110 and girls creator @entity112 , both of whom have 1.2m @entity1 fans			1
but her popularity is a puzzle to her parents			0
mrs @entity3 told @entity119 : ' i do n't know why people love @entity3 so much			1
she does not have any special talent that she is good at like dancing and she does not do much on camera			0
she only does a little drama and smiles and poses			0
' but she has something inside her that makes people love her and makes them happy			2
she is just very sweet			0
' whenever i put her in front of a camera , she is a natural and loves posing			0
' @entity3 , who has a @entity56 father , 34 - year - old @entity132 , and a @entity134 mother , speaks four languages , including @entity136 , @entity56 , @entity137 and @entity70			1
her short videos on @entity1 show her practising all four languages , dancing along to @entity140 and @entity56 pop music			0
she also has the occasional meltdown when she wants ice cream or chocolate			0
like @entity146 's @entity145 and much of today 's younger generation , @entity3 wears her heart on her sleeve and is completely comfortable living her life in public in front of a camera			2
she also has 305,000 followers on the short video website vine and 210,000 fans on a @entity157 fan page			0
on @entity158 , she has more than 55m loop counts - the measure @entity158 uses to record how many times people repeatedly play gifs , or image files			2
her popularity started when mrs @entity3 posted pictures of her daughter on her own @entity157 page			1
strangers begged her to set up a @entity3 fan page so mrs @entity3 obliged a year ago			1
the vine site was set up shortly after but it was only when she set up @entity172 on @entity1 seven months ago - mainly to stop fraudsters from pretending to be her - that @entity3 's fame rocketed			1
she has attracted hundreds of thousands of fans from @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179			0
one mother posted a message saying her day was not complete until she had seen @entity182 online besotted : fans flock to see her updates			0
@entity3 loves @entity185 , the colour pink and chocolate mystery : @entity3 's fame snowballed after her mother posted a picture of @entity3 on her @entity157 page			1
since then her parents have been bewildered by her soaring popularity taxi ! @entity3 holds her hand out to hail a cab looking as cute as a button in a typical image from her page ' most of them were posting comments in @entity70 , ' says mrs @entity3			1
' there were thousands of them			0
it was difficult for me to understand so i had to get them translated one by one			0
' i have no idea how they found her in the first place but they love her			0
' her hundreds of thousands of followers are besotted , with some even telling mrs @entity3 : ' i love her more than my own children '			1
one mother posted a message saying her day was not complete until she had seen @entity182 online			0
most of her followers in the region are in @entity179			0
@entity3 has been invited to present on game shows and model everywhere from @entity222 to @entity178			2
it was one such invitation that first brought the family to @entity30 in may for a fortnight 's holiday , which became a permanent stay			2
the @entity228 - who also have a seven - year - old son @entity97 - were living in a modest two - bedroomed apartment in @entity231 , @entity35 , and were running a seafood export business when the offer came to fly to @entity30 in may			1
since then , they have turned their backs on their @entity236 and @entity237 upbringings to convert to @entity238			0
they are still living in @entity30 , courtesy of their wealthy benefactors			2
like @entity86 's parents @entity243 and @entity245 , the @entity242 have been criticised for over-exposing their daughter , who is too young to know any better			2
but mrs @entity3 said : ' as parents , you are happy that people love your children			1
they fall in line for @entity3 's picture at shopping malls			2
' now @entity3 knows she is famous			2
if we go to the mall , she will ask why people are not taking pictures with her			1
she is used to it			0
' in @entity35 , she got attention and people wanted pictures with her because she is cute			1
here , they want to take them because they recognise her from @entity1			0
it makes us feel really special			0
' these famous people love this ordinary little girl and now she is extraordinary			2
' mr @entity269 denied the family was addicted to fame and said he worried about what would happen when @entity3 grew up			1
he said : ' i hope people keep loving her			0
sometimes i worry about what will happen in the future when they grow up			0
' we can not stop this now			0
if @entity3 is sick and we do not post a picture or video for three or four days , we are bombarded with thousands of emails from every country asking what happened			2
momentum : @entity3 's father said he could n't stop her fame now			1
he said : ' if @entity3 is sick and we do not post a picture or video for three days , we are bombarded with thousands of emails asking what happened ' fame : her mother told @entity119 : ' @entity3 knows she is famous			2
if we go to the mall , she will ask why people are not taking pictures with her '			1
the family converted to @entity238 after moving to @entity30 ' we are treated like famous actors here			0
even if we are in a restaurant and @entity3 is hungry , people hug and kiss her and you can not say no. ' @entity3 cried when the number of followers reached 600,000 , saying : ' i am just so happy '			1
she added : ' i love being in @entity30 , even though it is very hot			2
' her brother added : ' i am smart but @entity3 is beautiful ' .			0

@entity3 is adored across the globe and in the @entity66 in particular . she now has the same number of followers as @entity2
@entity312 moved from @entity35 to @entity30 where they have been put up in five - star hotels and driven around in limos for free
