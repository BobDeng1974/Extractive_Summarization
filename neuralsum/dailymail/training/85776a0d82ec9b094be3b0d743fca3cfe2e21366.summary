board officials confirmed the investigation into the practices at the @entity16 near @entity17 on tuesday			0

' we are investigating it very aggressively			0
the district attorney is on board and everybody is working hard to make sure we do this right , ' said @entity27 , an area supervisor with the livestock board			0
the dairy said in a statement that animal care and well - being are central to its operation			2
as a result , the dairy fired all employees and referred the abusive workers to law enforcement for further review following its own internal investigation			1
the dairy also halted milking operations , stopped shipments to all vendors and dispersed thousands of cows to other dairies with strong track records in animal welfare			1
in pain : in the video , dairy employees are seen punching , kicking , prodding and whipping the helpless animals at @entity16 in southern @entity3 kicked : @entity62 produces milk for @entity65 - based @entity64 , a cheese company which supplies @entity67 's pizza , @entity69 's and @entity68 ' we remain committed to the ethical and responsible treatment of the animals and have learned from this incident , ' the dairy said			1
it was not immediately clear whether the dairy 's closure was temporary			0
@entity16 is one of more than 140 family - owned dairies in @entity3 , a state that ranks in the top 10 nationally when it comes to milk production			1
the industry employs about 4,200 workers and has a direct economic impact of about $ 1 billion			0
the @entity86 - based animal welfare group @entity85 first sent the video footage to the livestock agency last thursday			1
it released a compilation of clips that show the abuse during a news conference wednesday in @entity94			0
an activist with @entity85 shot the video while working on the farm in august and september			2
aside from the whipping , kicking and punching , the video shows calves being tossed into the back of a truck and cows that ca n't stand being dragged with heavy equipment or lifted with clamps			0

the voiceover says many of the males will be killed for veal meat the group said the abuses uncovered during its investigations of six separate dairies around the country — including the @entity3 dairy — are all similar			2
' so this is n't a matter of a single dairy farm failing to meet industry standards			0
this is a matter of industry standards allowing for blatant animal abuse , ' said @entity134 , the group 's director of investigations			0
' that 's why we 're calling on the industry to make improvements at all of its facilities to prevent this type of abuse			0
' the @entity145 of @entity3 in a statement wednesday said the industry is committed to animal well - being			2
' the actions depicted in the video are unacceptable and do not reflect the daily care and comfort that @entity3 dairy farmers and dairy farmers nationwide provide their cows , ' the statement said			1
@entity85 is calling on @entity65 - based @entity64 , which is supplied by the @entity3 dairy and produces cheese for major pizza chains , to adopt a zero - tolerance policy for kicking , punching and shocking cows and require suppliers to provide safe and sanitary environments for the animals			1
