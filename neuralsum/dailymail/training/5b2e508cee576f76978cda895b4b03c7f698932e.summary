on trial : former news international chief executive @entity1 arrives at the @entity3 yesterday the phone hacking case has put ‘ @entity7 justice on trial ’ , a judge declared yesterday			1
in an extraordinary address to the jury hearing the case of former news international chief executive @entity1 and @entity14 spin doctor @entity13 , trial judge mr @entity9 stressed that the stakes could not be higher for @entity7 ’s judicial system			1
‘ in a way it is not only the defendants on trial , it is @entity7 justice on trial , ’ he said			1
he made the unprecedented comments as a jury of nine women and three men were sworn in to try @entity28 and @entity13 , both 45 and both former @entity30 editors			1
they are accused with others of being part of a six - year conspiracy to hack the phones of public figures at the now - defunct sunday tabloid			1
ahead of the case opening later today , the judge issued a lengthy series of instructions to the @entity3 jury , telling them : ‘ i ’m going to give you some extremely important directions			1
‘ they are always important , but they could not be more important than they are in this particular case			2
‘ it is a central principle of our system of trial by jury that you decide your verdicts on the evidence and arguments you hear in court , and only the evidence and arguments that you hear in court			2
’ the judge said there had been an unprecedented amount of publicity about the case , some of which was ‘ offensive and demeaning ’ to some of the defendants			2
he told them to disregard an inflammatory cover of the current edition of private eye featuring @entity28 , telling them to ignore what he called a joke ‘ in especially bad taste ’			1
jurors were also told to ignore comment on the case on @entity85 and other social media sites			2
in a dig at celebrity tweeters , he said : ‘ some public figures – well - known actors , musicians , politicians and others – publish blogs and send tweets in which they not only express their views on their own areas of expertise , but also on topics about which they know very little			1
in the dock : from left , @entity103 , @entity1 , @entity13 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity28 and @entity107 - their trial is to start today hearing : @entity109 editor @entity13 arrives at the @entity3 in @entity110 yesterday @entity112 appearance : @entity106 , the former personal assistant to @entity1 , arrives at the @entity3 ‘ i very much hope they will not do so during the trial			1
they may well be breaking the law if they do so and appropriate action will be taken if they do			0
‘ the internet is often fuelled by speculation			0
there has been a great deal of publicity about the subject matter of this case , perhaps an unprecedented amount			0
‘ a significant amount of publicity and speculation has been inaccurate and misleading			0
approach : @entity107 , the former head of security at @entity133 , arrives at the @entity3 yesterday case : @entity105 , the former royal editor at the @entity30 , arrives at the @entity3 yesterday arrival : @entity104 , the former managing editor of the @entity30 , outside the @entity3 yesterday end of the day : @entity28 and @entity1 in a taxi as they leave the @entity3 courthouse last night ‘ some , particularly on the internet on @entity85 , has been offensive and demeaning to some of the defendants			1
a lot of it is ill - informed and most of it is abusive			0
’ comments : mr @entity9 said the stakes could not be higher for @entity7 's judicial system jurors were warned they could face jail for contempt of court if they ignored the judge ’s directions			1
@entity28 and @entity13 allegedly conspired with former @entity30 head of news @entity103 , 44 , the tabloid ’s ex-managing editor @entity104 , 73 , and others to illegally access voicemails between october 2000 and august 2006			1
@entity28 is also charged with conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials			2
she also faces allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with former personal assistant @entity106 , 49 – over the alleged removal of material from @entity133			2
@entity28 , her husband @entity28 and former head of security at @entity133 @entity107 are also accused of conspiring together to pervert the course of justice			2
@entity13 , @entity177 ’s former spin doctor , is also charged with conspiring with the @entity30 ’s former royal editor , @entity105 , 56 , to commit misconduct in public office			1
they all deny the charges			0
by @entity184 shortly after lunch yesterday afternoon , nine women and three men learned that they would be spending most of their days between now and next summer cooped up in @entity112 of the @entity3			0
by teatime , it had become a much , much bigger deal than that following mr @entity9 ’ grave proclamation that ‘ @entity7 justice is on trial ’ here			1
you might expect to read that sort of thing in a newspaper headline but not to hear it from the mouth of a distinguished judge			2
' @entity202 ' : mr @entity9 , with defendants ( left to right in the dock ) @entity103 , @entity1 , @entity13 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity28 and @entity107 little wonder this has already had the ‘ trial of the century ’ tag slapped all over it			1
it ’s going to be a dawn start in the queue for the public gallery			2
this afternoon , the prosecution will start to outline the case against eight defendants including former @entity133 chief executive @entity1 and former @entity216 communications maestro @entity13			1
yesterday , they were all on their feet to hear the charges			0
the glass - fronted dock looked more like an executive box at a rather lugubrious race meeting than a traditional @entity3 line - up			0
this has already had the ' trial of the century ' tag slapped all over it			2
it 's going to be a dawn start in the queue for the public gallery miss @entity1 appeared paler than of late , her famous @entity233 locks now perhaps a few shades darker than when this all started			1
because the defendants must sit according to their position on the court list , she was not next to her husband , @entity28 , who was towards the other end of the dock			0
chin - up confident and taking notes on a computer , he managed the occasional smile during some of the opening legal acrobatics			0
there were so many wigs in the room that i totted up 18 at one point , 20 at another			0
it was like trying to count sheep			0
so vast is this assembly of legal expertise that the normal press benches have been allocated to all the solicitors while the press have been given a few chairs behind the ushers			0
most of the media were left to follow proceedings by video link three floors below			0
charges : former @entity30 editor @entity1 ( centre ) and her husband @entity28 ( right ) arrive just visible between mr @entity28 and former royal correspondent @entity105 was miss @entity1 ’s petite former personal assistant , @entity106			1
when the defendants were invited to sit , she almost faded from view altogether			0
alongside mr @entity105 , the retired managing editor of the @entity30 , @entity104 , was clinging with both hands to the bars between the glass panels as he stood to hear the charges			2
statement : by teatime , it had become a much , much bigger deal following mr justice @entity9 ' grave proclamation that ' @entity7 justice is on trial ' here later on , the jury was informed that the 73 - year - old would only be present when specifically required due to ill health			1
on his right , impassive and smartly - dressed in grey suit , white shirt and pale blue tie , mr @entity13 followed everything intensely			1
once or twice , he intervened to ask some of the less audible barristers to speak up during their legal arguments			0
such are the complexities of this case that it may be @entity298 before we hear from the defendants			0
but judge @entity9 was taking no chances that these jurors might be swayed – and not just by the inane tweets of clueless celebs			1
he also warned people sitting in the public gallery – where @entity307 - bashing @entity309 mp @entity308 was much in evidence during the day – that they should not display any sort of reaction in front of the jury			2
though no details were heard in open court yesterday , the judge even told the jurors to avoid mentioning the case to anyone ‘ over a pint ’ in the pub on the way home last night			1
on a more upbeat note , he did at least joke that by the end of this very considerable ‘ bonding ’ exercise , many of them would be ‘ friends for life ’			0
even veterans of the @entity332 were struggling to recall the last time a jury received a set of directions quite like this			0
as dusk fell on the departing defendants and the camera crews dispersed for another night , a pair of splendid plane trees peered down on the scene from the churchyard of @entity344			0
untroubled by this week ’s storms , they are still sporting a full thatch of green leaves			0
it is a sobering thought that the whole lot will have turned brown , fallen off , moulded away , sprouted anew and grown back all over again by the time this epic reaches its conclusion			0

mr @entity9 is judge for @entity1 and @entity13 trial
they *'re* accused of being part of conspiracy to hack public figures ' phones
judge tells jurors to disregard inflammatory cover of current private eye
