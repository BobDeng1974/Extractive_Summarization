the brazen attack occurred five years after he had raped a barmaid following a wedding reception			1
on each occasion @entity0 , who was responsible for bringing in work for 50 barristers , was either high on drink or cocaine and looking for sex			1
a jury of six women and five men took just two hours after an eight - day trial at @entity1 to find him guilty of rape , attempted rape and once sexual assault			1
they found him not guilty of one act of sexual touching on the barmaid			2
@entity0 , who has a 13 - year - old daughter and wife , put his head in his hands and turned pale before crying			1
his barrister @entity37 said @entity0 's mother was terminally ill and would not survive his sentence			1
the prosecution claimed @entity0 's clean - cut image as a charming gentleman masked a hard - drinking sexual predator			1
judge @entity44 , @entity45 , told @entity0 : ' i have no doubt you are a man prepared to take risks and you unquestionably did that			1
you raped and attempted to rape two women when you were affected by alcohol and both women were asleep			1
' you even perpetrated the two crimes by lifting their dresses in a very similar fashion whilst they lay asleep			2
' this has been a catastrophe for everyone concerned			0
in many respects you deserve a more severe sentence , but i am mindful of the appalling affect this will have upon you and your family			0
' his victim , a female barrister in her 30s in the room opposite his , was described by @entity0 as a ' gentle , lovely , sweet girl - almost timid			1
' the main attraction at the party was an ice sculpture , called a vodka luge , which allowed guests to take shots of snaps poured down two luge runs from the top of an ice mountain into their open mouths			1
there was a @entity82 , karaoke , dancing and ' quite a lot of drinking			0
' @entity0 said he had taken cocaine , given to him by a barrister friend , while solicitors and barristers enjoyed wine , spirits and nibbles and let their hair down			1
during the evening he had also shared a bottle of whisky with a @entity98 lawyer before leaving around 3am			0
he claimed his mind went blank after crashing on his bed and could not remember sending what he claimed were ' welfare ' texts to two female barristers at 3.40am : ' are you guys in the main room or @entity108 ' and ' make sure you are ok			2
. i 'm sleeping on the floor , u can have bed if struggling			2
@entity113 ' the junior barrister told the jury she had enjoyed a ' really lovely , fun evening in a nice atmosphere ' before offering to share a room with a female friend			1
she had left the party for the hotel leaving her room door unlocked			1
she texted her husband saying she ' loved him ' before falling asleep in her party dress because she had forgotten her pyjamas and did not want her room - mate to see her naked			2
she said : ' the next thing i remember was someone next to me cuddling up			0
i thought it was my husband			0
there was no initial alarm			0
' but i felt that person touching me			0
i was asleep at the time and put my hand down and touched him			0
i think i became more aware at that point			0
' she said she was sexually assaulted twice and could feel his weight on her as she slept face down			1
' i opened my eyes and looked and saw it was @entity0			2
i think i said : " @entity0			2
" he looked at me			0
i wanted to put my hands on my face			0
i said : " f * * * off ! " and kept repeating it			0
' @entity0 left the woman in a state of distress and went back to sleep in his hotel room			1
the junior barrister called her sister in tears , saying she had woken up to find a man ' on top of her			1
' she could barely breathe and talk and initially did not want to report it			0
a jury at @entity1 ( pictured ) yesterday found @entity0 guilty on charges of attempted rape , sexual assault and rape however , a solicitor doing an ' all - nighter ' at the party was informed by a colleague and called the police			1

he set about destroying forensic evidence by licking his fingers and dipping them in coffee provided in the police cell			0
he told the jury he had sleep walked through three doorways looking for a toilet			0
he claimed he had got in the junior barrister 's bed by mistake and reacted on ' autopilot ' when the woman touched his manhood			1
he admitted to the jury : ' when the realisation hit home , my whole world came crashing down			0
i did not believe anyone would believe my story			0
' in a victim impact statement , the barrister said she felt betrayed and the first week after the attack she felt sick and guilty for reporting it to the police			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) was described by the prosecution as an ' opportunistic sex offender ' capable of being charming and considerate she had to move chambers , lost out financially and had to be supported by family			1
she felt utterly defeated in august last year and went to the doctors to be described anti-depressants			0
she had difficulty explaining what had happened to her mother and it had affected her relationship with her husband			0
@entity0 told the jury he worked his way up from being a humble listing officer to a senior clerk responsible for a criminal chambers , sitting on management committees			1
he agreed to resign his job after being told he was to be charged			0
meanwhile , the police found a second complainant , a woman in her 50s who he had raped after a wedding reception			2
she told the jury : ' i thought everything was a dream			0
i could feel him inside me			0
i must have gone back to a deep sleep and the next thing i remember was his wife shouting at me			0
' she was bleeding and a friend of the woman telephoned @entity0 's wife telling her : ' this is rape			1
' she did not report it after being begged not to do so because of the affect on his family			0
crown barrister @entity240 told the jury : ' we do not say he is a prolific sex attacker dragging women of the street with a mask on			2
he is an opportunist sex offender who takes his chance when it arises			1
he is capable of being polite , considerate , business like , perhaps even a gentleman			2
however , when a female is vulnerable , perhaps in drink , he will take his opportunity			0
he can be charming , but he can also be sinister			2
