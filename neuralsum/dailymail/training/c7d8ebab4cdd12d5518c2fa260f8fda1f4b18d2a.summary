@entity0 launched its first mobile phone in a blaze of publicity in its bid to take on @entity5 and @entity6			1
however , one tracking firm claims the launch has been a damp squib , claiming the phone has been outsold by all its rivals			1
@entity0 has refused to reveal just how many handsets it has sold			0
scroll down for @entity13 @entity0 ceo @entity14 holds up the new @entity15			0
the handset has a 4.7 - inch display with 720p hd resolution , a quad - core @entity17 processor , @entity19 of @entity20 , and six individual camera modules to make the 3d effect work			1
the device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen			1
these extra cameras are used to track the position of the user ’s face and eyes in relation to the phone ’s display			1
the handset chooses the two best views , and can even work at night using infrared			0
this allows @entity0 ’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on - screen elements , altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in @entity50 - without the need for glasses			1
' while the @entity15 was listed atop @entity0 ’s @entity58 list for several days in early august , @entity55 usage of the device has grown only incrementally , rather than exponentially , in the three weeks following the smartphone ’s launch as an @entity62 exclusive , ' ad firm @entity53 said			1
it analyzed tens of millions of @entity63 and @entity66 smartphone - based online ad impressions generated within the @entity67 from july 25 through august 14 , 2014			1
the @entity15 phone 's usage share is .02 % , which puts its launch on par with that of the @entity73 , but below the launch of the @entity75 @entity76 said the @entity15 had performed badly compared to @entity75 's recently released @entity77			1
' usage rates of the @entity75 rose relatively sharply following its release earlier in the summer , particularly once @entity80 and @entity81 began offering the device on july 17 and 18 , respectively			1
' this contrasts starkly to @entity0 ’s @entity15 , with that device ’s usage growth remaining steady but relatively flat over the same post-launch time period			0
' however , the firm says the slow start to sales could be due to @entity0 's decsision to only sell the handset through @entity62			1
@entity0 's @entity15 was outsold by @entity75 's @entity75 ' the somewhat mild adoption of the @entity15 may be seen as an expected consequence given the smartphone ’s carrier exclusivity , ' it said			0
' while @entity0 certainly is looking to make the @entity15 a hit , current conditions show this being more realistic as a long - term goal rather than a short term one , ' the firm said			2
@entity14 himself said the company plans to ' be patient , ' and other industry watchers see the @entity15 as being a long - term play for @entity0			2
' discounting or expanding the availability of the device would likely help boost adoption , but it may be more likely that @entity0 refocuses its efforts for a second generation of the @entity15 and the accompanying software in order to make a larger mark on the industry			0
. the @entity15 handset was unveiled by @entity14 at a special event in @entity117			0
' it 's time to whip the crown from @entity5 , ' said mr @entity14 before showing off the new handset for the first time			0
the @entity15 also performed poorly compared to the @entity123 ultra the @entity15 will use head - tracking technology to make images on the smartphone 's display appear to be @entity50 with a feature called ' dynamic perspective '			2
' there is always more to see by changing your perspective , ' @entity14 said			0
' what if there were a thousand artists standing by to redraw the picture every time you moved your head ? ' apps using the new feature includes a @entity143 app that lets users see around buildings			2
users can also tilt the phone to ' look around ' an on screen map			1
the handset has a 4.7 - inch display with 720p hd resolution , a quad - core @entity17 processor , @entity19 of @entity20 , and six individual camera modules to make the 3d effect work			1
it will run a highly customized version of @entity6 ’s @entity159 operating system similar to the one seen on @entity0 ’s @entity161 tablets , and come with special tangle - free headphones			2
apps available at launch include @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
it also boasts a @entity171 screen with a rubber frame , and aluminum buttons			0
users will also have unlimited photo storage via the @entity176 , and syncing with the company 's recently launched @entity179 set - top box so you can send media to your tv			1
the phone has its own menu system , and users can even navigate by tilting the handset			1
they can also see different app catergies through a special ' tray ' that appears when they swip ( right ) ' @entity15 puts everything you love about @entity0 in the palm of your hand — instant access to @entity0 ’s vast content ecosystem and exclusive features like the @entity201 button , asap , @entity202 , x-ray , free unlimited photo storage , and more , ' said @entity14			0
' @entity206 button lets you identify printed web and email addresses , phone numbers , @entity210 and bar codes , artwork , and over 100 million items , including songs , movies , tv shows , and products — and take action in seconds			2
' how they compare : the new fire is up against @entity5 's @entity222 and @entity224 's @entity223 the @entity201 24 - hour video help feature will also be available on @entity15 , @entity0 confirmed			1
@entity14 said the most important thing the firm has done was to ' earn trust with customers '			0
the handset will initially be offered in the @entity63 only by @entity62 in a deal that echoes the launch of the original @entity233			1
the deal has already riled @entity62 's competitors , @entity117 based @entity237 ’s chief executive , @entity236 , tweeted , ' really , @ @entity0 ? what happened to home - town pride ? ' @entity0 also announced that the @entity15 will come with a new app called @entity206			1
this uses the camera and visual recognition to identify objects ranging from books to cds as well as listen to music before looking for it on @entity0			2
the feature will also recognise phone numbers and web addresses , as well as tv shows			2
@entity0 claims it can recognise 100 million items in less than one second			2
once an item is recognised , it can automatically take users to the corresponding @entity0 page so they can buy it			2
the app is triggered by holding the same button that serves as a shortcut to the @entity15 's camera			2
@entity261 , ceo at phone accessory maker @entity262 said ' the effect this will have on the @entity267 industry are substantial			0
' consumers are constantly looking for the newest and most innovative device and if @entity0 ’s @entity267 offers the suggested @entity50 viewing capabilities , the usual players may find their hold decreasing			0
' it is the first time the retailer has created a phone , and follows on from the success of the @entity277 and @entity161 tablet , with sales of ebooks overtaking those of physical copies in the @entity283 in 2012			0
although @entity0 did not confirm a release date for the @entity283 , experts predict it will be on sale this year outside the @entity63			1
@entity287 , mobiles expert at @entity288 said : ' @entity0 already has two very effective power - ups in its armoury : brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with			1
add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have a @entity299 on its hands			0
' @entity301 , operations editor at @entity283 - based gadget magazine @entity302 said : ' the @entity0 phone 's solid hardware and verging - on - pointless software features are irrelevant here			1
@entity0 sees this as a platform to flog its content , just as it did with ebooks on @entity310			0
problem is , all its video and audio content is or will be available on every other device known to humanity , leaving no compelling reason to buy its own phone			0
' @entity318 , industry expert and strategist at digital agency @entity320 said : ' alarm bells started ringing when i realised that @entity14 had spent more than twice the amount of time explaining how @entity325 was developed than actually showing us what it can do to improve the user experience			0
it clearly is n't a game changer			0
' @entity287 , mobiles expert at @entity288 , said : ' arriving so late to the over-crowded smartphone party requires tactical consideration , and @entity0 has covered all bases with a handset which is both big on spectacle and packed with features			0
' @entity0 already has two very effective power - ups in its armoury : brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with			1
' add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have an @entity299 on its hands			0
' @entity0 ’s killer blow lies in its deep connection to the prime subscription service			0
the fire phone is rather a gateway into its millions of books , movies and music on - demand , making the device key to a very appealing package .			1
