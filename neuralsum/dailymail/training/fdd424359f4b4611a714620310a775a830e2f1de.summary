by @entity0 last updated at 3:47 pm on 25th october 2011 a hotelier is suing @entity3 over claims she has lost thousands of pounds in revenue after the travel website accused her of posting fake positive reviews			1
@entity8 is taking legal action after a ' red flag ' was placed on the review page of the @entity13 hotel which she owns in @entity15 , @entity16			0
the business was ranked no 1 in the area , but mrs @entity8 claims takings have fallen 75 per cent after suffering a ' catastrophic collapse in bookings ' since the message appeared in august			0
personal mission : @entity8 , pictured promoting the hotel 's special dog suites , says business at the @entity13 hotel has slumped massively after @entity3 accused her of writing bogus reviews she said : ' i 've had to reduce my rates from between £ 80 to £ 125 to between £ 40 to £ 60 , ' she told @entity31			1
' this is a personal thing - me against a big company from @entity34 and i want to seek amends			0
' @entity3 gets around 45million unique visitors every month and positive reviews can attract a considerable amount of extra business			2
as a result , the firm has started scanning for suspicious behaviour in an attempt to identify those who manipulate the system			0
the message , which was posted on @entity13 's page in august , said @entity3 believed the hotel had been posting suspicious reviews			1
it reads : ' @entity3 has reasonable cause to believe that individuals or entities associated with or having an interest in this property may have interfered with traveller reviews and / or the popularity index for this property			2
' @entity60 - flagged : the @entity13 hotel and restaurant 's review page , which has been marked with a warning message ( top right and below ) due to concerns about the authenticity of its reviews accused : the message suggests it may not be an isolated incident , but mrs @entity8 says it has not happened at all mrs @entity8 believes it was one particular review which prompted the action , but claimed it was posted by a customer using the hotel 's @entity75 connection which would have given the impression it was written on an internal computer			2
she is being represented by online reputation management company @entity79 , which has asked @entity3 to produce evidence to support its claims			0
a spokesman for @entity3 said the ' red flag ' had not been applied as a result of an isolated incident			0
she told @entity31 : ' we have reasonable cause to believe that the owner and / or individuals associated with the owner fraudulently posted positive reviews on the @entity92 and negative reviews on a competitor 's property			2
' mrs @entity8 says she ' 100 per cent denies ' both of those assertions			0
shunned : the @entity13 hotel , in @entity15 , @entity16 , was ranked no 1 in the area , but now takings have dried up apparently as a result of the allegations @entity104 , co-founder of @entity79 , said : ' these are very damaging allegations against a small business			0
' i think @entity3 is trying to justify its fight against the overwhelming number of fake reviews by imposing a system that is not working			1
we will see if they have got the evidence			0
' mrs @entity8 knows the consequences of pursuing this case if she had written fake reviews , but she is determined to pursue this			1
' her case is believed to be first of its kind in the @entity121 and may lead to dozens of other hoteliers take legal action			1
last month , the @entity124 launched an investigation after claims that a large proportion of @entity3 's 50million reviews are fake			1
the formal complaint was lodged by @entity79 , which stated that the level of reviews which are fake and misleading has now reached ‘ epidemic levels ’ .			1

case believed to be first of its kind in @entity121
