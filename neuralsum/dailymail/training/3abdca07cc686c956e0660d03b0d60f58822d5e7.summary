in a shocking rip - off , the cost spirals further if customers agree to be connected to the number , because each extra minute costs £ 5			1
citizens advice raised the alarm about the extortionate prices after one man told them he had been charged more than £ 100 for a single call to a 118 number			1
the mobile phone company @entity22 has set the minimum charge for calling 118 numbers at £ 5 – compared with £ 3 previously			1
the £ 5 levy is 20 times the 25p that @entity27 was charging when its monopoly of the national directory service ended in 2003			1
the onward connection fee imposed by @entity22 can make the cost of a four - to five - minute call £ 25			1
calling from landlines can also be expensive			0
@entity27 , for example , has a minimum call charge of £ 2.98 to reach its own 118 500 service			1
it charges £ 3.58 to reach the rival 118 118 service			1
the directory enquiries shake - up in 2003 was ordered by the then telecoms regulator @entity40 despite huge misgivings among consumers who were happy with the 192 service			2
@entity40 wanted to bring in a raft of exciting and cheap rivals – but instead produced a wave of confusing and expensive tariffs			0
calls are understood to have halved in recent years			0

one citizens @entity16 helped a man who had unknowingly spent £ 100 on a single telephone call after using a 118 service			1
an increase in call costs will make these bills even bigger			2
‘ consumers who do n’t have access to the internet are more likely to rely on these expensive services and are at a greater risk of getting a shock bill			0
you can be ripped off @entity76 ‘ mobile providers need to be clearer about the cost of calling these numbers and how people could save money by getting the number they need , then putting the phone down and calling directly			2
’ @entity84 , the telecoms regulator which replaced @entity40 , has admitted the system does not work and it is about to unveil new rules it hopes will make the charges clearer			0
firms will be required to offer a single flat fee to access any 118 or non-geographic number beginning with 08			2
they will have to advertise this and include details on bills and in their contracts			0
the firms will also have to spell out their own fees in their advertising			0

however , the new system will not come into effect until may 2015 at the earliest			0
@entity110 rises : @entity22 defended its price rise saying it had increased the charges to call 118 numbers as the company had been subject to price hikes from the providers the market is dominated by 118 118 , which is run by the number , and 118 500 , which is the @entity27 service			1
they take 80 per cent of business largely because they have spent the most on marketing			0
@entity125 of the @entity126 said : ‘ these very high costs make it imperative callers do not let themselves be tricked into taking advantage of the offer to connect the call , at the same rate			0
’ @entity22 defended its price rise saying : ‘ we ’ve increased the charges to call 118 directory enquiry services as we have seen a number of price increases to us from the providers during the past 12 months			1
