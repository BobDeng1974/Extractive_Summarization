@entity1 counter-terrorism officials are involved in a frantic search for a friend of the @entity4 after she failed to return from @entity5 last year and has now posted ' alarming ' pictures online of women in head - scarfs dressed as jihadi soldiers			1
terrorist experts have become concerned that @entity11 , 23 , may have become radicalized to commit @entity13 violence and poses a threat to @entity1 at home and abroad because her @entity1 passport allows her relatively easy foreign travel			1
the pretty @entity18 , @entity20 student first came to the attention of authorities when she began to spout the false - flag attack conspiracy theories of radio host @entity24 in the aftermath of her friend @entity26 's dramatic capture in april			2
worry : @entity11 ( left ) is pictured here with her friend and suspected @entity31 bomber @entity30 in a social media posting uploaded to @entity11 's @entity34 social network page known as @entity35 @entity24 , who broadcasts 17 - hours a week online , claims that the @entity1 government planned and perpetrated the april 15 marathon attacks which killed three and injured more than 260 in @entity31			1
part of the small minority who are sympathetic to the younger @entity30 , @entity11 has been quoted by @entity41 as saying , ' a lot of it is ‘ @entity45 , he is crazy , ’ but a lot of stuff he says make sense			1
' he brings up a lot of valid points			0
' her two younger brothers , @entity54 , 20 and @entity55 , 18 , are already under suspicion by authorities because of their strong online backing and friendship with @entity26 that included posting pictures of themselves lighting fireworks with him two months before the attacks			1
frightening : these are the images of women jihadists in @entity5 posted to the @entity35 social networking site of @entity11 that have greatly concerned the @entity66 and counter-terrorism officials friends and brothers : @entity70 , 20 , ( left ) is friends with @entity30 as is his brother @entity55 , 18 , ( right ) - who posted the @entity31 bombing suspect messages of support in the aftermath of the terror atrocity in april @entity30 is being held at @entity20 federal prison @entity78 and recently the @entity79 has announced prosecutors will seek the death penalty for his part in the terror atrocity which killed three people and injured more than 260 people @entity11 is known to have traveled with her family to her native @entity5 in july , but failed to return home with her parents to @entity20 in august			1
her parents , @entity90 and @entity91 told @entity1 authorities that she remained behind to marry after meeting a man in @entity5 during @entity94			1
friends : this image shared online by @entity97 shows him and @entity31 bombing suspect @entity30 playing with fireworks in @entity31 before the april 2013 terror attacks @entity100 and @entity30 became highly radicalized in the lead up to the april @entity31 attacks , espousing independence for @entity104 from @entity34 - which borders @entity5 and is a predominantly @entity106 nation			1
' no one is calling @entity11 a terrorist but her travel has certainly garnered some attention			2
people are concerned that a 23 - year - old is in @entity5 , a country that she fled from ... and now she is deciding to stay on her own , ' a law enforcement source involved in the @entity113 investigation told @entity116			1
they also told @entity116 that they had become worried because prior to the marriage , the 23 - year - old had no ' obvious means ' of financial support			1
' we were already concerned about the social media exchanged with her brothers , who remain on the radar , especially the younger brother @entity124 , who was @entity26 's best friend , ' the source added			2
however , recent developments on @entity11 's @entity34 social media site @entity130 have begun to worry @entity66 officials			1
she has been posting pictures of @entity134 jihadis with guns and a photo - shopped image of a @entity1 passport in a carry - on bag featuring the black flag that signifies joining jihad			1
social media support : this post from @entity97 is one of many that alerted authorities to his continued support for his friend who is accused of carrying out the terror attack on the @entity113 in april father : @entity151 has categorically denied that any of his children are involved in @entity154 extremism and dismissed pictures his daughter @entity11 is believed to have posted online that show jihadi soldiers brandishing weapons @entity11 and her brothers did not respond to @entity116 when they attempted to contact them			1
her father , @entity151 was dismissive of any suggestions that just because photographs have been posted online , it means his daughter has been radicalized			2
' what does it mean , pictures ? pictures can be anywhere			0
it does n't mean anything , the pictures			0
we do n't want to talk about it			0
we talk with the @entity66 , everybody			0
the @entity66 came , @entity179 , everybody 's come , ' he said to @entity116			0
indeed , in the aftermath of his daughter uploading the photographs of jihadists , @entity151 's @entity18 , @entity20 home was raided by armed agents - just as the apartment was in april last year as authorities searched @entity31 for @entity26			1
rebel fighter fighters in the @entity188 : @entity11 is believed to have uploaded pictures of female jihadi 's onto her @entity34 social networking site @entity35 authorities have made it very clear to the family that @entity11 has not been indicted for any offences			1
the agents who conducted the raid questioned the @entity194 as to why they returned to @entity5 when they fled ten years ago			1
' they had a hard time getting out of the country and an even harder time coming back when she was not with them , ' said a law enforcement official familiar with the @entity70 family			1
the strong line of questioning led to @entity11 's sister , @entity207 , 26 , complaining to @entity208 and @entity210 officials that her family was made to feel like ' terrorists '			2
authorities were first led to the @entity194 after they discovered @entity215 messages that had been exchanged between @entity30 and @entity97 the day before the twin blasts along the finishing line of the marathon			2
suspects : @entity100 and @entity4 walk around the finishing line of the @entity113 on april 15 in addition to the social media exchanges between the @entity30 and his best friend @entity55 , authorities are also examining the @entity34 social network page vk that has the name @entity11 and links to a fan page for @entity26			1
the page which is sympathetic to the 20 - year - old bomber insists he is innocent and features several pictures of the @entity70 siblings with @entity30 , including one with @entity11 , her brother @entity54 , and ' @entity236 ' as a boy , which is the @entity34 spelling of the accused terrorist 's nickname			1
upset : @entity241 student @entity207 made a complaint to authorities after her family was questioned about their links to @entity4 and his brother @entity100 however , authorities do admit that the pictures of @entity134 women dressed as jihadi fighters in @entity5 are probably ten years old			1
in one photo , a woman in a black headscarf is toting an @entity254 rifle			0
@entity116 discovered that the images had all been removed days after they spoke to the @entity70 family			0
the @entity258 vk page also links to the @entity259 , which is heavily associated with @entity260 , the jihadi leader of the @entity261 who threatened to strike the @entity262 last july			0
there is no relation between the @entity194 in question and the terror leader			0
when interviewing their mother @entity90 last week , @entity116 described her becoming emotional when asked why her daughter had returned to @entity5 , especially after she fled the war - torn nation with her husband ten years ago			2
' she is getting married			0
she does n't speak good @entity34			0
they [ the @entity70 children ] come to this country as babies			0
this is my home now			0
i love my children being here , ' the mother said through tears to @entity116			0
@entity283 made it clear that she loves the @entity1 and is a proud citizen			2
according to law enforcement officers , the @entity286 and the @entity287 became friendly and father , @entity91 , acknowledged that the families ' knew each other '			1
@entity292 : runners continue to run towards the finish line of the @entity113 as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race however , @entity283 was unequivocal in her opinion of the @entity30 family when she told @entity116 , ' i do n't like them			2
' not one member of the @entity70 family has been charged with a crime or named as a suspect in connection with the april 15 attack on the @entity113			0
all five of the @entity70 children attended @entity310 and principal @entity311 said that they were all ' bright students '			0
junes and @entity54 were enrolled in @entity314 classes , and like their older sister @entity315 , could speak several languages			0
@entity315 graduated from @entity317 in june and @entity55 and @entity54 are roommates and students at @entity241 now			0
tragic day : two explosions went off near the finish line of the 117th @entity113 on april 15 , 2013 killing three and injuring more than 260 people @entity310 librarian @entity323 said the entire @entity70 family were proud of their @entity134 heritage			0
' they were fond of saying , ' we 're not @entity34			0
we 're @entity134 , ' @entity323 told @entity116			0
' @entity11 was the quiet one			2
' however , in his 2013 high school yearbook , @entity97 wrote , ' i 'm a stress free kind of guy ' -- which is the identical quote @entity30 tweeted two days after the bombings as law enforcement staggered to find them			1
@entity338 and @entity91 confirmed separately that their daughter is married but would not say when , where or where			0
@entity30 is being held at @entity20 federal prison @entity78 and recently the @entity79 has announced prosecutors will seek the death penalty			2
