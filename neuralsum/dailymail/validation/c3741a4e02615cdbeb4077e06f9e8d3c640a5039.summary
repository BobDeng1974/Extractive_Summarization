the proposed £ 16million fee that @entity1 will pay @entity2 to sign @entity3 on a permanent deal in the summer of 2016 is beginning to look like daylight robbery			1
the 22 - year - old condemned @entity7 to their first home defeat in 48 matches with his sixth goal in seven games after being allowed to leave @entity13 on loan in february			1
@entity3 was used as a bargaining tool for @entity16 to go in the opposite direction for £ 23.3m , rising to £ 27m with bonuses , but has been the more devastating of the two for their new clubs			1
' are you listening , @entity23 ? ' @entity21 allowed @entity3 to leave @entity2 on loan to @entity1 the front pages of @entity27 newspapers were dominated by @entity3 after his two goals against @entity7 @entity3 7 games 6 goals @entity16 5 games 0 goals @entity3 did not suit @entity21 's style of play and made just two starts in 2014 - 15			1
he averaged nine minutes per game between august and january , and the arrival of @entity38 saw him further kicked to the curb			0
@entity21 and @entity3 agreed it was best he get first - team opportunities elsewhere , and @entity1 's faith has been rewarded against @entity7 he sent a message to @entity2 by starting a run from his own half in a lethal counter-attack			1
he outpaced @entity47 before beating goalkeeper @entity48 in the top left corner to make it 1 - 0 in the 11th minute			0
@entity51 and @entity52 were on the same wavelength when they tweeted @entity3 is ' on fire ' and the @entity56 , four years younger than @entity38 , has plenty of time to improve			2
@entity3 opens the scoring with after a superb solo run from his own half against @entity7 the @entity56 international salutes the crowd after scoring against @entity65 champions @entity7 @entity3 ( right ) spent most of his time at @entity2 on the substitutes ' bench under manager @entity21 @entity69 : 67 appearances , 13 goals			1
@entity2 : 19 appearances , two goals			0
@entity1 : seven appearances , six goals			0
@entity76 : 35 appearances , 20 goals			0
on his arrival , @entity1 manager @entity79 announced @entity3 would have to ' adapt to our football ' and that ' this is a league that 's different from the @entity85 and the @entity86 '			2
@entity87 admitted it could take a year for @entity90 's signings to develop , but no such time frame has been required for @entity3			0
any suggestion he could not perform against @entity94 teams was dismissed on march 1 when he punished @entity95 in the @entity96 with a quick - witted one - two			0
and three days later he scored the winner against @entity98 at the @entity99 to earn @entity1 's first win in that fixture since may 2000			0
all this has helped @entity1 stretch their unbeaten run to 13 games as the man behind @entity51 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity38 in the pecking order gets put to good use elsewhere			1
@entity1 's @entity111 forward @entity110 congratulates his team - mate on thursday evening the @entity1 squad join hands and run towards their fans in celebration of the win			2
