a drug has been shown to be highly effective in reducing symptoms of depression without having a negative effect on libido , according to research			1
@entity6 acts on the hormone melatonin , which is thought to play a part in mood disorders			2
it has also been found to cause fewer of the other side effects associated with many conventional drugs , including weight gain			1
no effects : the new drug @entity6 does not affect the patient 's libido its therapeutic effects can kick in earlier too – within the first week in some cases – compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or @entity22 , which can take weeks to work			1
@entity23 affects about one in ten adults at some point , and many sufferers are prescribed antidepressants			0
the drugs change the levels of a group of brain chemicals , including serotonin and norepinephrine			2
making more of these chemicals available can improve mood and emotion , although how and why is not fully understood			0
common illness : depression affects one in ten adults at some point in their lives however , common side effects of @entity22 include low sex drive or erectile dysfunction			1
there is increasing evidence that the body ’s circadian rhythm system , which governs the release of hormones , is also heavily involved in depression			0
this led to the development of agomelatine			0
it mimics the activity of melatonin , helping to regulate the circadian rhythm			0
melatonin is produced at night and is involved in the sleep - wake cycle			0
