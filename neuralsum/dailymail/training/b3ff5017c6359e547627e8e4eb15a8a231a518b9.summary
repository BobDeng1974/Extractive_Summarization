demand : judge @entity0 said the @entity2 defendant must remove her burkha in the courtroom because the principle of open justice overrode the 21 - year - old woman 's religious beliefs a judge told a @entity2 woman she must remove her burkha in court before she can enter a plea after she refused to reveal her face			1
judge @entity0 said the principle of open justice overrode the 21 - year - old woman 's religious beliefs , and warned there was a risk a different person could go into the dock pretending to be her			1
the woman , from @entity21 , east @entity22 , who can not be identified for legal reasons , appeared before @entity25 today charged with intimidating a witness			1
she said she can not remove the veil in front of men because of her religious beliefs			1
judge @entity0 told her : ‘ it is necessary for this court to be satisfied that they can recognise the defendant			1
‘ while i obviously respect the right to dress in any way she wishes , certainly while outside the court , the interests of justice are paramount			1
‘ i ca n’t , as a circuit judge , accept a plea from a person whose identity i am unable to ascertain			2
’ he added : ‘ it would be easy for someone on a later occasion to appear and claim to be the defendant			2
‘ the court would have no way to check on that			2
’ her barrister , @entity52 , told the court the woman was not prepared to lower her veil at all while men were in the room			1
‘ in front of women , it is not an issue ’ , she said			0
‘ it is simply men that she will not allow to see her face			0
’ hearing : the woman , who appeared before @entity25 , pictured , was charged with witness intimidation ms @entity52 suggested herself , a female police officer or a female prison guard could identify the defendant and confirm to the court that it is the same person as in the police arrest photos			1
under the veil : the judge said there is a risk that if a @entity2 woman was allowed to cover her face with a veil in court a different person could pretend to be her ( file photo ) prosecutor @entity83 added that the police officer in charge of the case was content that he recognised the defendant while she was in the burkha			1
but judge @entity0 rejected the suggestions , saying : ‘ it seems to me to be quite fundamental that the court is sure who it is the court is dealing with			1
‘ furthermore , this court , as long as i am sitting , has the highest respect for any religious tradition a person has			2
‘ in my courtroom also , this sometimes conflicts with the interests of a paramount need for the administration of justice			0
in my courtroom , that ’s going to come first			0
’ the judge added : ‘ there is the principle of open justice and it ca n’t be subject to the religion of the defendant whether the principle is observed or not			1
‘ i am not saying this because of the particular form of dress by this defendant , i apply that to any form of dress that had the same issues			0
’ judge @entity0 adjourned the case for legal argument over whether the defendant should have to remove her veil			1
it will be heard again on september 12 , when the defendant is expected to enter a not guilty plea and go to trial			0
the defendant is alleged to have intimidated a witness , in @entity127 , @entity22 , in june			2
the @entity128 caused controversy around the world when they moved to ban women from wearing the burkha in public			0
politicians moved to ban the veil because they argued it was a security risk and said it was a social hindrance			2
the law - which sparked protests in @entity141 - was brought into effect in 2011 under the leadership of former @entity128 president @entity144			0
@entity146 politicians are also no stranger to controversy surrounding the burkha			0
in 2006 , former @entity151 foreign secretary @entity150 sparked outrage when he said he had ask @entity2 women to remove their veils when talking to them in his constituency surgery			0
three years ago @entity156 mp @entity156 tabled a private members ' bill which would have made it illegal for anyone to cover their face in public			0
however , the bill fell by the parliamentary wayside following claims that bringing in such a law could be in breach of the @entity168 .			0

judge @entity0 said open justice *overrides* religious belief in court
woman , 21 , said she can not remove her veil in front of men at all
@entity0 said there is a risk someone could pretend to be her in the dock
case adjourned so *lawyers* can argue whether the defendant must remove her veil
defendant , who can not be named , is charged with intimidating a witness
