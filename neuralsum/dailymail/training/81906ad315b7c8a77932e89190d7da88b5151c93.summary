controversial : the government is pressing ahead with plans to explore shale gas drilling known as ' fracking ' , despite 1,000 activists descending on a test site earlier this year in @entity28 , @entity29 ( pictured ) the process involves pumping water , chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure until it cracks the move is an apparent attempt to boost public support for fracking just days before firms are given a new wave of provisional licences to drill			1
ministers are preparing to identify huge areas that should be explored , the @entity17 added			1
fracking , or hydraulic fracturing , involves pumping water , chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure to blast it open and release gas which is trapped inside			2

one site in @entity57 was suspended briefly last year after the test drilling caused small earthquakes			0
anger : police remove a protester from the fracking test site in @entity28 , @entity64 , earlier this year but the government supports exploring the divisive technique , saying it will boost the country 's energy supplies at a time of uncertainty			2
a statement in august said ' government policy seeks to increase security of supply ' , adding there was a ' continuing role for gas in the energy mix and support for shale gas exploration '			0
