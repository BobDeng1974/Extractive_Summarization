it is the ' @entity1 ' , but @entity2 , one of the top destinations for @entity5 tourists , is barely known outside the country			1
tucked between the @entity8 and the @entity9 , peaks etched on the horizon like a backdrop to a stage , @entity2 is rather off the beaten track			1
that could all change when the shinkansen , @entity9 's famous bullet train , arrives next year at an appropriately gleaming station , rebuilt in 2005 under a dome of glassand - steel fretwork and fronted by a wooden gate shaped like a drum , with a digital clock marked out in tiny bubbling fountains			1
it is a tourist attraction in its own right			1
a bridge into @entity9 's beautiful past : @entity2 is filled with places that exude a sense of the old @entity9 often likened to @entity32 , @entity9 's former capital , for its wealth of old buildings ( escaping earthquakes and war damage alike - though not always the careless redevelopment of post-war years ) , @entity2 was once the fourth - biggest city and flourished in feudal times			1
for nearly 300 years the town was under the control of one clan , the @entity46 family and , in places , you can still imagine being back a couple of centuries			1
for example , the @entity50 is the only place outside @entity32 with geishas			2
the traditional architecture - low roofs of glistening curved black tiles , finely latticed frontages ( easy to see out , but not in ) - is unchanged			2
geishas in elaborate kimonos and ghost - white faces can be seen , or heard practising their songs and instruments : the drum or the three - stringed shamisen			2
at the shop where the @entity68 family has made shamisen for 130 years , visitors are allowed to practise too			2
in response to our summons by xylophone ( serving as a bell ) , we were led upstairs for the obligatory green tea , before being let loose on the shamisen with instructions on how to play @entity77 , @entity77 ( @entity77 , @entity77 ) , a simple folk song			2
the samurai ( warrior ) district of @entity82 is likewise perfectly preserved			2
fashions and flavours of the @entity85 : @entity86 in @entity2 ( left ) ; crabs , as sold at @entity88 ( right ) paved lanes , surprisingly free of the usual spaghetti tangle of overhead cables , wind between ochre mud walls ( the higher the wall , the higher the status )			1
by the 400 - year - old canal is the @entity98 family house , deludingly calm for the residence of a warrior , with its uncluttered interiors , tatami straw mats , sliding paper doors and meditatively peaceful garden with the inevitable carp swimming in gently trickling waters			2
on display is a scroll - a thankyou letter , dated october 9 , 1566 , to @entity98 for killing a high - ranking soldier			2
' we are very happy that you brought us his head , ' it says			2
across the iron bridge ( identified as a ' registered national tangible cultural property ' ) spanning one of @entity2 's two rivers is @entity120 ( ' temple town ' ) , a quiet enclave of temples and shrines , and gatherings of statues with red bibs , memorials to children			1
but the biggest tourist attraction is @entity131 , once part of the 18th century castle ( some of which still remains ) , and now one of the top three gardens of @entity9			1
visiting is not a peaceful experience , as large groups are led around by megaphone - wielding guides , and a photographer on a stepladder takes pictures of neatly grouped tourists			1
rather more tranquil is the smaller family - owned @entity146 , where there are moss - covered stone lanterns , winding paths under trees , streams and waterfalls			2
this was the perfect setting to learn about the tea ceremony , explained gravely by @entity157 in the tea house			0
taking time , keeping in step with the past : a traditional @entity5 tea ceremony @entity9 's tea ceremony involves confectionery , and that is entirely appropriate in @entity2 , which is renowned for its sweets			1
in @entity169 , we 'd come across @entity170 , a sweet shop since 1625			0
@entity2 also has a reputation for more wholesome fare , especially seafood			1
the stalls at @entity177 market are laden with baby aubergines , long - stalked slender mushrooms and huge melons , but mainly tuna , crabs , squid , oysters - and eels			0
@entity186 was coming up ( the nutrients are supposed to help you survive the heat of the summer ) , and long queues were kept in check by cordons			0
we lunched there , at @entity194 where saucers of salmon , prawn , tuna and pickled plums were ferried along the counter to us			0
each place setting had pots containing soy sauce , slivers of ginger , green tea powder ( next to individual taps for boiling water )			0
it was an easier meal - though not so lavish - than the feast we had another day at a traditional restaurant , sitting for an hour on our folded knees on the floor			0
at the other extreme , we were taken by a resident into a basement , past the customary models of different dishes ( how else would we know what to eat ? ) to booths supplied with a computer tablet for ordering our food , which arrived promptly and without ceremony			0
when the message ' we are close time at soon ' flashed up , we consulted the tablet ( no need to call for the bill ) , paid up and left			0
by this time we 'd moved from the @entity228 , which more or less lived up to its name ( women bowing to residents as they entered the lifts ) , to @entity233 , with its rows of slippers at the door and ofuro ( communal bath ) , and a larger ' eight - tatami room ' with futons			0
it was an oasis of tranquillity , though situated - in something of a culture clash - just one block from a shopping street where the stores included @entity247 and @entity248			0
a version of @entity9 undamaged by war or modernity : parts of @entity2 have a visibly historic feel the juxtaposition made @entity2 's @entity257 - designated @entity256 status seem rather surreal , though @entity259 porcelain and lacquer work have been made here since @entity262 days			1
one pottery we found had exquisite little bowls costing several thousand yen			0
visitors are encouraged to participate in the local crafts , and the tourist office has sessions for making tiny dolls from cloth and tote bags from newspaper			0
i learned how to decorate chopsticks using gossamer - thin squares of gold leaf			0
nearly all gold leaf used in @entity9 comes from @entity2			1
in one shop - offering gold - leaf body lotion and gold and silver golf balls - we were given cups of tea containing flecks of gold			0
it 's good for health and vitality , apparently			1
upstairs were toilets tiled in gold ( ' feel free to use , ' said the video at the foot of the stairs ) and a gallery full of the sort of thing a @entity301 villain might have in his home , like gold horses and dragons			0
amid all the tradition , the 21st century @entity305 ( opened in 2004 ) comes as a great surprise			1
just across the road from the sculptured landscapes of @entity131 is a low circular glass and white building set in green lawns with installations by international artists like @entity315			0
the glass walls encircling the galleries provide insight into the free public spaces that include a library , playroom and cafe with gleaming white banquettes			0
there is no front or back to the museum , and with four entrances it encourages approach from all sides ( no doubt a cultural statement as well as an architectural attraction )			0
it 's a bold and brilliant attempt to assert @entity2 as a modern town of culture as well as a venerated historic one			1
@entity338 ( @entity339 , 0117 370 9730 ) offers seven nights in @entity9 from Â£ 1,599 including two nights in @entity342 , four nights in @entity2 ( three in the @entity344 , one at the @entity345 ) and a final night in @entity342 ; transfers and all domestic transport ; private guiding in @entity342 and @entity2 ; and return flights			1

@entity353 - speaking guides can be booked at the tourist office at the station or through www.kggn.sakura.ne.jp .			0
