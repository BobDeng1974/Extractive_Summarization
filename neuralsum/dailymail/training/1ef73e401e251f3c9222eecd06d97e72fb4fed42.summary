controversy : former @entity2 president @entity1 made a u-turn over @entity5 's role in the single market one of the key architects of the @entity9 single market today admitted @entity5 would be better off leaving the @entity10			1
mr @entity1 's radical u-turn comes 22 years after he infuriated prime minister @entity12 and other @entity13 by trying to force @entity9 federalism on the @entity5			1
in november 1990 the economist became the subject of a famous headline in the @entity19 newspaper which read : ' @entity20 ! ' @entity21 @entity1 , who was president of the @entity2 three times , suggested that ' the @entity5 are solely interested in their own economic interests , and nothing else			1
we could offer them another kind of partnership			0
' in an interview in the @entity33 economic daily @entity31 , mr @entity1 continued : ' if the @entity5 do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the @entity10 , we can anyway stay friends , but in another way			1
' mr @entity1 suggested @entity5 might sign up for an agreement ' like that of the @entity40 ' or a ' free trade agreement '			2
if @entity5 does leave the @entity10 , said mr @entity1 , the country would still be a ' partner ' , because it is ' strategically and economically important '			2
but , in a typically cutting aside , mr @entity1 said that ' other countries ' were also important in the new economic order , including @entity46 and @entity47			0
the @entity5 belongs to the @entity10 since 1973 , but has not joined the @entity48			0
on thursday @entity49 , the president of the @entity50 , warned that @entity52 's drive to repatriate powers from @entity55 risks damaging the @entity10 and could cause the collapse of the single market			1
mr @entity49 - who chairs the @entity10 's summits - said the prime minister 's attempts to achieve a new settlement with @entity9 were destabilising the 27 - member bloc			1
' if every member state were able to cherry - pick those parts of existing policies that they most like , and opt out of those that they least like , the union in general , and the single market in particular , would soon unravel ' said mr @entity49			0

i do not expect any member state to seek to undermine the fundamentals of our co-operative system in @entity9			0
' eurosceptic conservatives are concerned that the party could lose out to @entity93 , the @entity5 @entity94 , in the 2015 general election unless mr @entity52 makes more effort to boost @entity5 sovereignty over @entity55			0
delors became the president of the @entity2 in january 1985			0
during his presidency , he oversaw important budgetary reforms and laid the groundwork for the introduction of a single market within the @entity106 , which came into effect on 1 january 1993			0
in the autumn of 1988 @entity1 addressed the @entity109 , promising that the @entity2 would be a force to require governments to introduce pro-labour legislation			0
prime minister @entity12 responded with her famous @entity115 in september 1988 , in which she said that she had not rolled back the frontiers of the state in @entity5 only to see them reimposed by a @entity55 superstate			1
these developments were of key importance for domestic @entity5 politics â€“ as recently as the early 1980s large elements of the @entity124 had been opposed to @entity5 membership of the @entity2 , whereas the @entity126 had favoured joining			2
the @entity19 's now infamous headline made prime minister @entity12 's message loud and clear @entity1 puts on a brave smile as he arrives ahead of talks with @entity12 facing a fight : prime minister @entity52 will now have to confront his own party 's @entity13 camp following the comments from @entity1 after 1988 , however , it was to be the conservatives who were divided , with @entity12 and her supporters opposed to further @entity9 federalism			1
on 1 november 1990 , shortly before @entity12 was ousted as prime minister , @entity1 bore the brunt of @entity142			1
the @entity19 's famous headline sent the message loud and clear with ' @entity145 ' in response to his supposed attempts to force @entity9 federalism upon the @entity5			2

the proposal from mr @entity1 prompts concerns @entity21 might be willing to cut @entity5 loose , boosting the influence of @entity156 , as the @entity10 moves to fiscal and political union in 2014 in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis			1
in a concerted campaign to keep @entity5 in @entity9 , @entity33 and senior @entity9 officials have warned that @entity5 demands to be able to " cherry pick " which bits of the @entity10 it signs up to could unravel the whole bloc			2
prime minister @entity52 is under pressure to give the @entity5 public a say on whether to leave the @entity10 , demands that will be fuelled by the comments from mr @entity1			1
mr cameron has said he supports continued @entity10 membership but wants a ' new settlement ' involving @entity5 opting - out of justice measures and seeking exemptions to any further centralisation of power in @entity55			0
he is widely expected to make a speech in the @entity181 outlining plans for a referendum in 2015 , which would voters a choice between a new relationship with @entity9 and leaving altogether			0
this includes committing to a national referendum on whether @entity5 wants to remain in the @entity10 .			0
