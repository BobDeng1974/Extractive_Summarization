by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 11 april 2012 more grim details emerged about the drug practices of the white supremacist couple who got high and had oral sex with a teenage babysitter who died that night			2
as a part of the ongoing trial of @entity11 , the wife of @entity12 , who is accused of helping him dispose of 16 - year - old @entity15 's dead body in september 2011 , the @entity8 court heard more about the couple 's drug friendly attitude			1
mr @entity12 is a member of the @entity18 , a white supremacist gang , and one of his peers wrote a letter from prison about the torrid details that mr @entity12 confessed			2
trouble : at the time of @entity15 ' death , @entity12 was on parole for prior burglary and firearm charges , and he was also known to be part of the @entity31 , a white supremacist prison gang help : police reportedly received a confidential tip about the whereabouts of @entity15 ' body by members of @entity12 's gang gang member @entity39 said mr @entity12 called himself a ' watcher of the flock ' meaning that he felt it important that he be the one to help teens do drugs ' so they would n't go elsewhere and try it on their own ' one of @entity15 ' friends , whose name was not released , also testified that the two of them would go over to the @entity12 's house to smoke drugs , and that the 36 - year - old man was the one to teach them how to smoke methamphetamine out of a light bulb			1
@entity39 's statement , which was read in court , confirmed the account of the night given by mrs @entity11 , saying that @entity15 died in their home because of the drugs and they could not revive her			1
the letter also detailed mr @entity12 's rehashing of he and his wife 's sexual dalliances and drug use with the teen prior to her death			1
' i was paranoid and i did not want to be involved , ' wrote @entity39 , who is currently serving time for unknown charges			0
his motivation to help , however , was more personal : ' i have a 16 - year - old daughter			1
' @entity39 was not the only gang member who found the @entity12 's behavior to be an affront , as @entity74 has been identified as the police informant who tipped them off to the location of the body			2
serious charges : @entity12 , 36 , is charged with far more involvement than his wife , and is said to be the one who actually killed the girl by injecting her with drugs dark side : during her testimony , @entity11 said that @entity15 asked the couple if she could have sex with them in august - a month before she died - and also requested to be paid with meth instead of cash ' i wanted the family to have closure , ' mr @entity74 said			1
' then again , they came at me and said they knew about my involvement in it and that they 'd give me immunity if i helped them			0
' new details also painted a grizzly picture of the body itself when it was finally found , as detective @entity105 said that @entity15 's corpse was found kneeling face down , covered in brush in a rural part of @entity110			1
he said that her neon toe nail polish , ankle bracelets and jawline helped identify her			0
the added details come a day after @entity11 told a @entity116 courtroom about the extent of their relationship with the girl before her death , including their varied drug use and group sex sessions			1
months after the september 10 death of @entity15 , the @entity124 were charged for their involvement in her death and mrs @entity11 testified against her husband in court on monday after receiving immunity for any direct involvement with the girl ’s death			1
mrs @entity11 faces one third - degree felony charge relating to the disposal of @entity15 ’ body , but prosecutors have called her overall involvement ‘ minimal ’ as compared to mr @entity12 ’s , as he faces charges of child abuse homicide , unlawful sex with a minor , the disposal of the body and obstruction of justice			1
the 39 - year - old , who filed for divorce from her husband after they were charged with the death of @entity15 , told the torrid story of how the couple befriended and corrupted the young girl in the months leading up to her death			1
mrs @entity11 said that they started using @entity15 - or @entity153 as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011			1
accomplice : @entity11 , seen here in an earlier court appearance , discussed how she helped her husband @entity160 dispose of @entity15 's body corrupted : @entity15 , 16 , reportedly asked the @entity124 how to get meth and they started smoking the drug , along with heroin and marijuana , with the girl they became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the teen before @entity15 began requesting that they try harder drugs like methamphetamine and heroin			1
eventually they even began paying @entity15 in meth			1
one of their most raucous nights as a group came in august , a month before her death , when @entity15 reportedly asked to become sexually involved with the married couple			1
' @entity160 and i started kissing and having sex			0
then @entity15 jumped in , ' mrs @entity11 told the court			2
on the fateful night of september 10 , the couple wanted @entity15 to babysit because they were going to go shopping for their daughter ’s birthday			2
neither babysitting nor shopping ended up happening			0
as soon as @entity15 arrived at the house , mr @entity12 helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck			1
found : a full autopsy could not be performed because @entity15 ' body was so decomposed , but significant traces of heroin and meth were in her system then , when she was ‘ as high as she had ever been ’ , she and her husband performed oral sex on one another			2
mrs @entity11 says that she was not involved in the encounter			0
a short while later , the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘ freaking out ’			0
she reportedly felt disoriented and cold , so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple ’s master bathroom			0
after leaving her alone in the bath at her request , the @entity124 checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold , so mrs @entity11 wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom			0
the couple left her to go smoke some cigarettes , and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive			0
‘ she was n't breathing			0
she had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth , ’ said mrs @entity11 , who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail			0
they then tried to figure out what to do next			0
‘ it really was a panic			0
the idea of it was , we will lose our kids and go to jail , and there was nothing we could do to bring her back , ’ she told the court			0
mr @entity12 was on parole at the time for prior burglary and firearm charges , and he was also known to be part of the @entity31 , a white supremacist prison gang			0
mrs @entity11 , who also had outstanding court dates due to her involvement with two unrelated prescription drug fraud and child endangerment cases , says that she dressed the then - naked body of @entity15 and put it into a foot locker which the couple moved into a box in the trunk of their car			1
leaving their 6 - year - old daughter at home but taking their toddler with them , they ' drove all over the place ' disposing of any evidence that may connect them to the crime			1
they dumped her body in a remote area of @entity110 where mr @entity12 covered it with brush and shrubs so that it was hidden			0
police only found it six weeks after @entity15 ’ death with the help of a confidential tip from @entity74 , one of mr @entity12 ’s gang members			1
moving on to the remaining evidence , they left @entity15 ' purse in one dumpster with the box that had held the body , then drove to a different dumpster where they left the carpet from the car ' in case there was any evidence on it '			2
facing trial : @entity12 is in prison awaiting trial and @entity11 ( right ) is free on bail spot : the couple - along with their toddler - drove around extensively disposing of @entity15 ' body and all evidence			1
she was found here in @entity110 six weeks after her death after filing for divorce from mr @entity12 in february , mrs @entity11 is free on bail but police say that she will ‘ not get a walk on all of ( her ) charges ’			2
so far , police officials seem to agree with mrs @entity11 ’s version of events though a full autopsy could not be completed because of the decomposition of the body			0
the state medical examiner did conclude that there was a serious amount of meth and heroin in the girl ’s body at her time of death			2
‘ drugs are dangerous and unpredictable			0
every time you use drugs there is a chance of death , ’ said medical examiner dr @entity315			2
prosecutor @entity323 included the other charges against mr @entity12 in his assessment , saying : ‘ after a lengthy period of drug use ... and sexual misconduct , she died			0
