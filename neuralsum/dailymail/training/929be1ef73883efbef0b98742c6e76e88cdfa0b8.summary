by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 09:40 est , 15 august 2012 a stressed - out student trying to make his life easier tried a cheeky way to skip the last few chapters of a novel set as homework - only for it to sensationally backfire			2
the student took to @entity7 earlier this week , asking for a book summary of @entity9 , by @entity10 , admitting he had not finished the book			1
by the following day , however , the student was rumbled - not by an angry teacher or disappointed parent , but by the novel 's author ... who was not impressed			2
caught out online : a student was reprimanded by author @entity10 after he posted this on @entity7 in an attempt to get away with not reading @entity10 's novel for an assignment the author reprimanded the student posting : ‘ i 'm bummed out that you do n't want to try and finish it , and not even because you think it 's bad , but just because it seems like work instead of like fun			1
’ @entity10 told @entity28 that he was particularly bothered by the student ’s ‘ huffy list of excuses ’ for not finishing the 226 - page novel including being a slow reader and his local library was undergoing renovations			1
angry author : @entity10 , right , was pleased his book @entity39 and @entity40 had to , left , made it on a school reading list but was not impressed by a student 's online attempt to do an assignment without reading it under the username @entity54 ~ @entity53 , the student had written in his original post : ‘ i have n't been able to finish this book			1
can someone give me a complete review , including everything important ? i really need this ! and it 's not because i 'm slacking			0
’ reading low : with a low national reading level , @entity58 students are assigned books appropriate for a 5th grader @entity10 , who is also a founding member of improvisation group @entity62 , was quick to post photos on @entity64 and @entity65 of a screenshot of the @entity68 post joking that he was a ‘ full service author ’			1
he tried to convince the student it was worth finishing the book			2
@entity10 wrote : ' i think you 'll find there 's a ton more sex , swearing , and drugs in my book than anything else you have been or will be assigned in high school			2
' others posted a range of responses from calling the student lazy and a whinger to encouraging him to read the book			1
released in march , a report on american high school students found that national reading levels remained low , with assigned book lists reflecting a level appropriate for 5th grade students			1
only 34 per cent of students were rated proficient in reading on the 2011 @entity96 , an exam done every two year			0
the national 12th grade reading level was lower in 2009 than in 1992			1
the lowest sat critical reading scores were recorded last year			0
first off , i 'm really excited that my book is being suggested for summer reading			0
on the other hand , i 'm bummed out that you do n't want to try and finish it , and not even because you think it 's bad , but just because it seems like work instead of like fun			0
i 'm not going to sit here and act like i did n't sometimes not read assigned books for class in high school			0
even though it 's referenced once in my book , the book you 're avoiding reading , i 've never actually read " @entity116			2
" so i 'm sympathetic to your plight			0
but i think you 'll find there 's a ton more sex , swearing , and drugs in my book than anything else you have been or will be assigned in high school , and i do n't mean in the way your teacher will tell you " you know , @entity128 has more sex and violence than an r - rated movie ! " i mean it 's all there , in terms you will readily understand without having to @entity135 them			0
plus not once to i refer to anything as a " bare bodkin " or anything like that .			0

the student asked online for someone to ' completely cover ' a 226 - page novel
the author , @entity10 responded , reprimanding the student and encouraging him to read the book
the @entity58 reading level of students is low , a report released in march showed
