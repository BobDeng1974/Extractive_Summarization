by @entity0 the state should encourage marriage and try harder to get couples to stay together while their children are young , ministers have been told			1
a drive to persuade couples to marry rather than simply live together would help combat high break - up rates among cohabitees , a report said			1
it also called for state spending to concentrate on families with young children , because this is the time when family relationships are under the greatest pressure and have the highest chance of breaking up			1
a push to persuade couples to marry rather than simply live together would help combat high break - up rates , a report will suggest today ( library image ) the recommendations were prepared by the @entity26 think - tank in response to a call from work and pensions secretary @entity28 for ideas on how to keep families together			1
mr @entity28 ’s @entity31 is aimed at gathering information on how families are changing , which are most at risk of failing , and how the state can do more to keep them together			1
the @entity26 , which was launched by @entity38 family judge sir @entity37 , said in the first published evidence to the review that the families most at risk are those of unmarried new parents			1
it said that cohabiting couples make up fewer than one in five parents , but half of all family breakdown			2
state spending should concentrate on families with young children who are under pressure , the @entity26 added ( library image ) the foundation ’s report added that half of all family breakdown happens before a couple ’s child reaches its second birthday			1
it said that once couples reach the ten - year mark , outside factors seem to have very little influence on whether or not they stay together			2
foundation spokesman @entity64 said : ‘ there is little point in the government attempting to improve the stability of established marriages			0
approximately as many married couples who stuck it out between 1960 and 1970 are still together as those who married in 2000 and made it to 2010 , despite the many social and cultural changes in that period			2
mr @entity75 is aimed at gathering information on how families are changing ‘ what we need to do instead is to encourage couples considering having a family to marry and then support them through the trouble - filled early stages			1
‘ if they can make their marriage work for ten years , their children will have an 80 per cent chance of their family staying together for good			2
’ mr @entity64 said many object to state attempts to influence personal decisions , such as whether to marry			2
but at the least , he said , the government should not discourage commitment			0
‘ currently , there is a couple penalty on all partners who share a home , ’ he said			0
‘ it can cost parents with one child up to £ 7,100 a year in lost tax credits the moment they move into together			0
‘ so the government is incentivising couples not to commit			0
meanwhile it is spending more than the entire defence budget on the costs of family breakdown , £ 46billion including court fees , child truancy , juvenile delinquency and related incidents of crime			0
‘ no less important is the unseen personal impact on the lives of our young people			0
the effects of family instability in early years continue to be felt decades later			0
’ he added : ‘ it may be difficult politically to be seen to favour married couples , but the focus should be on children and giving parents incentives to create the most stable possible environment for bringing up their families			1
’ @entity129 has spoken regularly about encouraging marriage			0
but so far ministers have offered only a minor tax break , worth up to £ 200 a year , to lower income married couples .			0

couples should be encouraged to marry rather than just live together
state spending should concentrate on keeping families with young children *togther* , @entity26 report adds
made in response to minister *'s* call for ideas to keep families together
