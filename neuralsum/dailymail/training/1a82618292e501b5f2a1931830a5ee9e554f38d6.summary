by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 15 may 2013 a mechanic has built the world 's smallest campervan which has a tiny 4ft by 4ft living space			2
despite its confined size the pedal - powered mini mobile home still has room to squeeze in four seats , a stove , a sink , a table and a bed			1
dubbed the ' cramper - van ' , the invention by custom car fanatic @entity17 , is a mash - up of an old @entity21 van and a @entity23 - style pedal cart			1
the tiny vehicle cost £ 1,000 to build it may come with all the mod cons , but for campers more used to the wide open spaces of the great outdoors its bijou living area could take some getting used to			1
a clever use of space means that inside the minuscule motor 's cabin seats for four people , although one of the seats folds down over the two - ring hob and sink			1
the roof space extends out by 2ft 6ins , providing enough room for a small bed			0
the only other thing that sets it aside from its bigger brothers is its lack of an engine , instead relying on pedal power to pull it along			0
it is officially classed as a bicycle so does n't have to be registered to go out on the roads - although it must be fitted with lights if it is going out after dark			1
uphill battle : @entity17 said the cramper van is extremely hard work to pedal down the road tiny vehicle : @entity17 and work colleague @entity67 ride in the van			1
it cost £ 1,000 to build and does n't have to be registered to go on the roads because it is officially a bicycle the ' cramper - van ' was dreamed up by @entity17 who chopped 6ft off the front of a @entity21 campervan and attached it to the pedal cart before refitting the interior			1
it took around two weeks to make and cost him £ 1,000 in materials			0
@entity17 , owner of @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , said : ' we think our mini camper is the smallest camper in the world			0
i certainly do n't know of anything else smaller			0
' the @entity87 was the smallest camper van ever made , and we 've shaved about 6ft off that			1
if there was anything smaller i 'd be very surprised			0
' @entity17 , 50 , has made a name for himself creating weird and wonderful custom cars including a @entity95 - inspired multi-coloured @entity93 , a mini @entity96 and 21 - inch tall car			2
@entity17 added : ' the mini camper really was n't planned - it was just one of those things that popped into my head , which is how the best ideas come about			2
tea for two : the cosy space inside the vehicle - which does n't leave a lot of leg room as the whole vehicle is just 4ft by 4ft compact : @entity17 ( front ) and @entity67 squeeze into the back of their tiny mobile home which is far smaller than the one that can be seen in the background ( left ) fold down : the vehicle has four seats			1
the back two seats fold down over the hob and sink to make the best use of the limited space ' one of my salesmen was talking about a pedal bike and i just thought why not combine it with a camper van			1
' the idea evolved at the speed of light - within 15 minutes we had sourced a pedal bike and a camper van			2
' we had this old scrap @entity21 camper that had been sitting around for about four years which was perfect for the camper section			2
' it can be pedalled but you do have to have legs like @entity141			0
no wing mirrors : @entity17 looks out the back of his pedal mobile home			0
he chopped 6ft off the front of a @entity21 campervan and attached it to a @entity23 pedal cart before fitting the bespoke interior ' you certainly would n't want to go camping in it around too many hills			1
' we wanted the camper to be finished to the highest quality			0
' inside it 's fully insulated and upholstered , it has a twin hob to cook on , a sink to wash up in			0
' it has four seats although you have to make sure you 're finished cooking because one of those seats is on the hob			0
' it 's got a big side window and even a small bed - you have to tuck up a bit but it 's perfect for a power nap			2
' it is a little cramped but it 's all good fun - everyone who sees it says " wow "			0
