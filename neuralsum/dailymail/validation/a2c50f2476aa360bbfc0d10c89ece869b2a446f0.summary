@entity0 : the past few years have been awful : my husband left me for his pa			1
i felt dowdy and middle - aged , so embarked on a programme of exercise and dieting			0
even so , i was amazed when a trainer at my gym , who ’s 27 ( i ’m 49 ) , asked me on a date			1
i want to say ‘ yes ’ , but i fear it ’s undignified and that my body will repel him			0
what should i do ? @entity15 advises a woman who has been asked out on a date by her younger gym trainer ( picture posed by models ) answer : i have a friend who swears the best way for any middle - aged woman to make a decision is to ask themselves : ‘ what would @entity27 do ? ’ the queen of pop would never let a trifling thing such as dignity stand between her and a hot young man			1
nor did the director of @entity34 , @entity35 , put decorum before personal happiness when she wed a much younger actor			1
would it have been more seemly to deny herself an unbelievably handsome husband just to ensure the more censorious members of our society were n’t scandalised ? of course , this kind of chutzpah is far easier to talk about than achieve			1
it comes more naturally to celebrities than mere mortals			0
but that does n’t mean you ca n’t borrow a little bit of that erotic entitlement			0
this man has gone out of his way to pursue you			1
it ’s also a bit daft , under the circumstances , to be fretful about your body			0
if he works in your gym , then surely he ’s got a good idea of your physique			2
the simple fact is that he fancies you rotten			0
in short , why do n’t you do this man a favour and take his request seriously ? if he ’s interesting and sexy , you should simply assess him for these qualities			2
treat him like any other man who might have the good sense to ask you out			2
please say ‘ yes ! ’ — perhaps with the addendum : ‘ because i ’m worth it ! ’			0
