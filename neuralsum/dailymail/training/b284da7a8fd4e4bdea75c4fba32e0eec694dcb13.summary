the numbers entering @entity3 were the lowest since 2004 , when hundreds of thousands of @entity16 workers were allowed in			1

ministers hailed the figures as a major step towards achieving the government ’s aim of reducing immigration to the levels of the 1990s			2
the key net migration figure – the number added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been counted – dropped by nearly 25 per cent from 242,000 to 183,000			2
students coming in to join courses at further education colleges went down by 67 per cent , while those going to @entity40 language schools fell by 76 per cent			2

immigration minister @entity69 said : ‘ this is a significant fall in net migration and the total number of visas issued is at its lowest since 2005			0
‘ this shows we are bringing immigration back under control			0
our tough policies are taking effect and this marks a significant step towards bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this @entity85			1
‘ at the same time , we continue to attract the brightest and best : these figures show that there has been a small increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for the university sector – and a further increase in student visit visas			0
it ’s clear that international students continue to come to the @entity3 ’s world renowned universities			1
’ graph shows annual long - term migration estimates for the @entity3 between 1991 and 2011 graph shows changes in immigration from the five most common countries into the @entity3 over the past five years @entity105 chairman @entity104 added : ‘ conservatives in @entity27 are committed to getting immigration under control			1

’ but @entity134 , of the left - leaning @entity135 , said : ‘ this fall in net migration has been driven by a significant fall in the number of foreign students coming to the @entity3			1
clampdown : the drop was driven by an eight per cent fall in the number of people coming to the @entity3 to study , with 213,000 students arriving this year compared to 232,000 last year ‘ steps to reduce abuse of the student visa system are welcome , but if the government ’s net migration target is to be met , there also needs to be a dramatic fall in the numbers of genuine foreign @entity153 will come at a significant economic cost			1
’ emigration from @entity3 helped drive down the net migration total			1
in the year to the end of march , 353,000 people left to live abroad , compared with 336,000 in the previous year			1
study was the main reason for immigration , but there was an 8 per cent drop in the number of those coming here for formal study , with 213,000 students arriving this year compared to a peak of 232,000 in the year to march 2011			1
