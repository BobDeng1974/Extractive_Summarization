it has taken him four matches to get there , but today @entity4 finally gets top billing at the @entity6 for his fourth round showdown with @entity8			1
the two of them have been given the prime - time slot of the late evening match on the main @entity13 — at about 9.45am @entity14 time on sunday morning — even getting the vote over local heroes @entity17 and @entity18			1
although @entity20 is a lip - smacking prospect , it was still a surprise move , given how much interest there is here in the gifted young @entity25 , who were scheduled on the @entity26 and @entity27			2
@entity4 preparing in practice for his fourth round clash at the @entity6 @entity4 celebrates on his way to his third straight - sets win of the week in @entity32 in the third round imagine @entity14 having two emerging young players making the last 16 of @entity35 and newspaper front pages , and then being scheduled on @entity37 and two , and you get the idea			1
@entity4 has been in excellent form , and about the only thing that has been bothering him is the concern he expressed this weekend with his brother about how few tennis facilities have been built in his native @entity46			2
for now he will concentrate on reversing the outcome of the @entity35 quarter - final of last summer when @entity8 knocked an unusually flat and tetchy opponent out in straight sets			2
one factor in this match is that sitting in the @entity54 ’s corner , as he was in @entity55 , is @entity57 coach @entity56 , such a respected friend of the @entity58 that he came close to hiring him as his head coach before the appointment of @entity61 at the start of 2012			0
@entity63 will take on @entity8 in the fourth round , the man who knocked him out of @entity35 last year @entity8 brought an abrupt end to @entity4 's defence of his @entity35 title at the quarter - final stage in 2014 as a result @entity4 and @entity8 are regular sparring partners			1
‘ we were actually going to be practising with @entity4 the weekend before the tournament started , but then we found out that we were close to each other in the draw , so obviously neither player would want to hit with the other under those circumstances , ’ said @entity56 yesterday			0
‘ it ’s one of those cases where they know each other ’s games well , there are n’t going to be too many secrets between them			0
’ it will be their seventh meeting , with @entity4 leading the series 4 - 2 , both of his two defeats coming last year			0
what is clear from @entity4 ’s demeanour here is that he has his ‘ game head ’ on , and is very fired up to produce another run deep into this event			0
overall you would predict him to edge it , although @entity8 is a wonderful shotmaker and a surefire future @entity100 winner capable of beating anyone			0
@entity57 young star @entity17 could face @entity4 in the quarter - finals in @entity32 and fellow @entity57 young gun @entity18 has also made it through to the fourth round			1

@entity4 set to face @entity8 in fourth round of @entity6
the clash gets top billing on @entity112 arena at @entity113
it is set to get under way at about 9.45am @entity14 time on sunday
@entity25 @entity18 and @entity17 are on other courts
