by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 07:41 est , 13 october 2013 lord @entity1 was rear - admiral until he was shot and killed at the battle in 1805			1
touted as one of @entity6 's greatest military triumphs new research shows 1,260 soldiers were foreign @entity1 's victory at the @entity9 is thought of as one of @entity12 's greatest military achievements			1
but new research by the @entity14 and the @entity15 has shown that the fighting was done by hundreds of foreigners , including some @entity18			1
of the 13,000 who served on the 33 ships to take part in the battle , 1,260 of them were born outside of @entity12 or @entity24			1
they came from as far afield as @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and another 20 @entity30 countries			2
while most were from neutral or allied nations , 24 @entity31 and 54 @entity18 also served in the 1805 fleet			1
one was @entity34 , 25 , from @entity35 , on @entity36 , whose marines took the surrender of vice admiral @entity39 , the leader of the @entity18 and @entity31 fleet			1
@entity41 , 22 , from @entity31 , sailed aboard @entity42 which was heavily damaged in the battle			1
another name which stood out was @entity45 who served on the @entity46 , and is the only woman proven to have been present , though witness accounts describe others being there			2
she is listed as carrying out ' useful services ' , which were likely to have involved tending the wounded , cooking and washing			2
among the furthest from home were @entity56 , 31 , from @entity57 , in @entity58 , and @entity59 , 34 , born in @entity60 , @entity61 , on @entity62 , the flagship of rear admiral @entity64 , and the first vessel into action			0
this painting by @entity69 shows the aftermath of the battle which claimed the lives of 449 @entity12 sailors the enormous firefight included 33 @entity12 ships and roughly one in six of the @entity77 's serving personnel another was @entity79 , a 20 - year - old of @entity81 origins , born in @entity82 , then a @entity12 colony			1
he was serving as a midshipman on @entity85 , @entity1 ’s flagship , and after being wounded @entity1 ’s rolled up coat was used as a pillow under his head			1
@entity79 's blood bonded some of his hair to it			0
the surgeon had to cut the garment away to treat @entity79 , who kept the fragments			0
the research also found that around a quarter of the crew were inexperienced ' landsmen ' with less than a year at sea			1
speaking to the @entity100 , naval expert at the @entity15 , said : ' not only was the fleet very cosmopolitan , it also was n’t as highly skilled as is perceived			0
' that has been part of the @entity1 myth , that this was a crack fleet			1
' kiss me @entity108 : @entity1 was hit by a @entity18 musket ball during the battle and later died from his wounds as the world spiralled towards all - out conflict for the first time during the napoleonic wars , a huge strain was placed up the @entity77 trying to combat the might of @entity119 's fleet			1
around one in six of all the men employed by the @entity77 at the time took part in the battle , and around a seventh were from land - locked counties such as @entity126 and @entity127			2
the research is part of an ongoing project to extract information from various sources including muster lists , certificates of service and biographical works held in the @entity15			2
the latest findings are to feature in the @entity14 ’s new @entity1 , @entity77 , @entity139 gallery which opens on october 21 , the 208th anniversary of the battle			1
the data has also been used to create an ancestor tracker which people can use to find out if their ancient relatives served in the battle			2
@entity12 lost no ships during the firefight , but 449 men were killed and 1,217 wounded			1
@entity18 and @entity31 losses were 4,408 dead , 2,545 wounded and some 20,000 taken prisoner			1
gurkhas are known for their long curved combat knives , which serve as part of the @entity156 's crest @entity152 - one of the oldest groups of foreigners to serve in the @entity12 army is also one of the only one still serving today			2
the @entity156 was formed after the defeat of @entity161 in 1816 following two bloody campaigns by the @entity163			0
during the conflict a mutual respect developed between the soldiers , and @entity12 officers admired the @entity152 for their fighting spirit , so allowed them to volunteer for the @entity169 's @entity163			1
the @entity156 's numbers peaked during @entity171 at 112,00 and there are thought to be around 3,500 serving today in @entity173 and elsewhere			0
@entity176 - as @entity175 spread across @entity30 in 1914 colonial troops were called up in increasing numbers to serve the powers that ruled them			0
for @entity12 that meant drawing huge numbers from @entity27			0
around 100,000 @entity176 volunteered to serve in the @entity163 despite making up just 2 per cent of the @entity27 population			0
they were so fierce and well organised that by the end of the conflict @entity6 officers who served with them were wearing traditional turbans as a mark of admiration			0
@entity24 - when the world went to war for a second time in 1939 most of the @entity24 mainland was no longer a part of the @entity12 , and so its soldiers were not called up			2
in fact @entity24 troops were told not to join @entity12 forces in the fight against @entity200 and threatened with being labelled as deserters if they did			0
despite the threat which meant they were unable to work for the state for the rest of their lives , thousands suck away to join the @entity30 conflict			0
they were only recently granted a pardon by the @entity210			0
@entity28 - another extended battle often called the finest in @entity12 history was the @entity213 , when @entity215 pilots successfully defended the @entity12 mainland from @entity218 attacks as @entity200 prepared to invade			0
however , among the @entity12 pilots were several @entity28 who later formed the first @entity220 in 1941 , an @entity28 section of the @entity215 which initially flew defensive patrols			0
as the war progressed , however , they were drafted into offensive operations and were joined by two further @entity220 squadrons which became operational late in 1941 .			0

of 13,000 soldiers on ships ' books , more than 1,000 were foreign
includes 54 @entity18 and 24 @entity31 fighting against their countries
a quarter of the whole crew were ' landsmen ' with less than a year at sea
new data forms part of an *exhibition* *due* to open on october 21
