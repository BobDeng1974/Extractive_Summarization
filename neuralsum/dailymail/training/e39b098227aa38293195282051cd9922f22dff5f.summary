click here to view our brilliant @entity2 service including @entity5 's goal ... @entity6 would have pictured @entity7 in @entity8 as @entity9 treated the ball like a bar of soap to gift @entity13 a goal remarkably similar to @entity16 ’s for the @entity17 four years ago			1
for a second @entity22 in succession the @entity19 ’s plans for an opening game were undone by a goalkeeping clanger			0
this time it came in @entity25 when substitute @entity5 advanced without challenge and struck a shot that should have been gathered easily only for @entity9 to horribly misuse his hands and allow the ball to topple over the line			1
the @entity19 , who turned 68 as this match switched from tuesday to wednesday in @entity33 , acted quickly and sent on veteran striker @entity34 , who rescued a point almost instantly by tapping in a rebound after a brilliant run and shot by fellow substitute @entity38 16 minutes from time			1
@entity39 and @entity13 end in stalemate blunder : @entity39 goalkeeper @entity9 drops @entity5 's shot into his goal to give @entity13 the lead too late : @entity9 looks on as the ball crosses the line after the @entity39 goalkeeper spilled the ball nightmare : @entity9 lies with his head in his hands as @entity53 collects the ball from the net horror : @entity9 reacts after his blunder gave @entity13 the lead against @entity39 worth a gamble : @entity5 shot from distance should have been easily gathered by @entity9 super sub : @entity5 celebrates after his speculative effort on goal went in leveller : @entity64 , surrounded by defenders , fires the ball home to equalise for @entity39 hero : @entity39 frontman @entity34 celebrates after his goal spared the blushes of @entity9 @entity39 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity9 3 ; @entity71 5 , @entity72 5 , @entity73 6 , @entity74 6 ; @entity75 6 , @entity76 5 ( @entity38 60 ’ 6.5 ) , @entity77 5 ( @entity78 72 ’ 5 ) ; @entity79 5 , @entity80 5 , @entity81 5 ( @entity34 6.5 )			1

@entity13 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity93 4.5 ; @entity94 5 , @entity95 6 ( @entity96 72 ’ 5 ) , @entity97 6 , @entity98 6 ; @entity99 6 , @entity100 6 , @entity101 6 , @entity102 7 ; @entity103 6.5 ( @entity104 ’ ) , @entity105 5.5 ( @entity106 56 ’ 5 ) subs not used : @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 - young			1
booked : son , @entity102 , @entity101 manager : @entity119 6.5 mom : ki referee : @entity122 6.5 @entity124 fans remember the lacklustre football served up by @entity6 in 2010 and the savage manner of their elimination at the hands of @entity129 in the last 16			1
and for large periods this match was played in the same staid style			0
he left @entity38 , one of the stars for @entity39 at @entity135 , on the bench and when he arrived @entity39 were immediately illuminated			2
it was an odd call that chimed with some of his curious decisions from four years ago			0
he is paid handsomely to make such choices of course , to the tune of nearly £ 7million annually – the most of any manager in @entity144			0
these two teams were the final pair to be getting their @entity22 finals underway but it was hardly a case of saving the best till last			0
the first half was a turgid affair that lacked pace or penetration from either side			2
that the only shot on target came via a thumped free - kick from 35 yards out says much			0
@entity160 centre - back @entity73 decided to bypass any build - up play by striking straight for goal and forcing goalkeeper @entity163 into an unconvincing save			1
by the end of the opening period @entity13 had enjoyed only four touches in the @entity160 box while @entity39 had just two in the @entity171 area			1
the team from @entity173 did at least provide football that was attractive on the eye , with @entity177 ’s @entity176 , who spent last season on loan at @entity180 , performing his midfield role with usual balance and probing passing			0
his full - blooded tackle on @entity79 that earned a booking showed he has an edge too			0
flying high : @entity39 's @entity79 is upended by @entity187 hot pursuit : @entity13 frontman @entity190 races away from @entity39 centre - back @entity53 eyes on the prize : @entity39 midfielder @entity75 and @entity13 's @entity195 race for the ball over the top : @entity13 's @entity198 flies through the air after challenging @entity39 's @entity80 @entity201 striker @entity200 could have had a couple if his finishing matched his reputation as the current @entity171 footballer of the year			1
in the 10th minute he combined nicely with team - mates and ran at the @entity160 defence only to blaze his shot over , and 30 minutes later he collected @entity210 striker @entity190 ’s header down , jinked into the area only to lash high and wide again			0
the second half had more interest inside five minutes , with both goalkeepers looking decidedly uneasy against shots from distance			0
@entity163 tipped wide @entity75 ’s effort then @entity9 was twice slow to reach strikes from @entity102 and @entity219			2
on the touchline : former @entity124 manager @entity6 gives instructions to his @entity160 team talking tactics : @entity6 gives orders to his players during the @entity227 clash against @entity13 taking aim : @entity13 frontman @entity200 powers a shot towards goal as @entity79 watches on giving it everything : @entity234 stretches in an attempt to dispossess @entity200 @entity236 then almost embarrassed the 28 - year - old with a 30 - yard free - kick			1
in the 68th minute @entity94 went from range again and @entity9 could do nothing to stop the goal			2
it was a criminal error and it remains to be seen whether he is in place for the match against @entity245 in the @entity246 next			0
@entity7 was dropped , of course			2
@entity9 has @entity34 , 31 , to thank for salvaging a point six minutes later with his first touch			1
@entity38 ’s run was penetrating and his shot crisp			0
@entity34 pounced on the rebound to move level with @entity254 ’s @entity160 record of 26 goals			2
left for dead : @entity13 's @entity256 looks on as @entity39 's @entity75 powers on forward behave ! referee @entity259 shows @entity13 frontman son a yellow card during the first half challenge : @entity76 goes to ground under the challenge of @entity176 love : one @entity13 fan produces a heart symbol ahead of kick - off			1

@entity13 and @entity39 draw 1 - 1 in @entity227 clash
@entity39 goalkeeper @entity9 drops substitute @entity5 's speculative effort into his own goal
blunder was *reminiscent* of @entity7 's mistake for @entity124 against @entity17 in 2010
@entity34 equalised for @entity6 's side
