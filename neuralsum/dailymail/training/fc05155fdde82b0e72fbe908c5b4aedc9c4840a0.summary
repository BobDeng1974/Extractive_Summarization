hundreds of battle - weary troops flying home from @entity2 endured a 48 - hour delay at a sweltering @entity5 airbase because of a farcical row over an aircraft 's damaged tyre			1
box - ticking military chiefs refused to allow the @entity11 's crew to swap a damaged tyre with one from a nearby international airport - because it would breach a £ 10.5billion private - finance deal , passengers claimed they were told			1
instead , top brass sent a team with a new wheel on a 3,400 - mile trip from the @entity20 to the @entity21			1
grounded : a @entity11 transporter aircraft flying @entity20 troops home from @entity2 was delayed for 48 hours because of a row over replacing its spare tyre ( file picture ) it meant more than 250 soldiers desperate to see their families after six months fighting the @entity30 were forced to twiddle their thumbs at the base until the replacement arrived			1
some servicemen were even forced to cancel their eagerly - awaited summer holidays because of the hold - up			2
the fiasco happened on july 16 as the troops , including 100 members of the @entity40 , travelled from @entity41 to @entity42 in @entity43 , via the @entity44			0
as they prepared to depart @entity45 , the @entity11 was suddenly forced to abort take - off after striking a bird			1
a check of the stricken £ 150million transport plane revealed the collision had punctured a tyre - which was replaced with a spare carried on board			1
however , during the emergency landing a second tyre was damaged and needed to be replaced before the plane could take off			2
the disgruntled troops - already three days late returning to @entity20 because of a broken - down plane in @entity2 - were herded into huts where temperatures touched a stifling @entity61			1
because the @entity63 are militarised versions of the @entity66 passenger jets , the @entity11 crew tried to source a new tyre from an international airport in @entity69			1
astonishingly , senior military officers in the @entity20 refused permission			2
passengers were told this was because it would invalidate the aircraft 's warranty under a private - finance project signed with the @entity79 consortium in 2008 - costing the @entity81 extra money			1
the deal , where the government repays the cost of planes over 27 years , apparently states all repairs must be carried out by engineers based in the @entity20			1
however , today , the @entity81 denied that the contract stated it has to use its own engineers			0
one soldier said : ' it was an absolute disgrace			0
we were fobbed off with one excuse after another			0
' it was only a flat tyre			2
the aircrew said it would have taken an hour to change and yet it ended up taking two days			0
there was almost a mini-riot			0
' farcical : more than 250 soldiers had flown from @entity41 base ( pictured ) but were left stranded in the @entity5 until a replacement wheel could be flown out from @entity20 one of the reasons the @entity11 selected the @entity105 was because spare parts were available all around the world			1
the soldier told the @entity109 : ' we were told that the aircrew we trying to source a tyre locally and we should be back in the air in a few hours			2
' then the message came through that the @entity11 engineer chain of command had refused permission , claiming it could invalidate the warranty			2
' there was a real protest			0
a lot of people were very frustrated , very angry			0
' some of the guys on board were returning to the @entity20 to go on family holidays and were going to miss them			2
' the story kept changing with every briefing we were given			0
one minute we were going to get spare tyres locally and the next we were n't			0
' no one could believe it			0
what is the point of having a strategic aircraft which can only be repaired in the @entity20			1
it 's an absolute nonsense			0
' the incident is the latest problem to hit the @entity63 , which were acquired by the previous government for air - to - air refuelling and transporting troops			1
three years ago the @entity81 's deal to buy the planes from @entity79 was condemned as ' not value for money ' by mps on the @entity145			0
and last year it emerged that the planes were failing to refuel @entity11 fighter jets			2
technicians had to work out how to stop leaks that occurred when the pipes of the giant @entity63 were attached mid-flight to @entity153 to fill them up at the rate of 5,000 litres a minute			0
the @entity81 was also blasted by the @entity155 , @entity20 's spending watchdog , for ' astonishing failures ' because the planes can not be flown in warzones as they lack proper protection			1
an @entity81 spokesman said : ' we understand how much the chance to see loved ones means to our personnel and that is why any leave lost will be given back in line with standard policy			0
' while we of course try to get service personnel home as quickly as possible , unforeseen circumstances can cause delays and safety has to be a priority			0
' flying replacement tyres out from the @entity20 on the next available aircraft was the quickest solution available			1

@entity11 aircraft was left with a tyre problem after being hit by bird
crew could have swapped tyre with one from a nearby international airport
but top brass ' *feared* it would breach a £ 10.5billion private - finance deal '
instead a new wheel had to be flown 3,400 - miles from the @entity20 to the @entity21
