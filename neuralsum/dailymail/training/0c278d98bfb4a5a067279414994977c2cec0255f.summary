not happy : officer @entity8 was evidently upset when @entity12 ( left ) flagged him down and berated him for throwing a candy wrapper out the window of his patrol car not impressed : the officer was unfazed when @entity12 told him that as a cop , it is his duty to uphold the law the trio continue bickering for several more minutes , with the officer growing increasingly angry at the two men for stopping him in his tracks over a candy wrapper chucked out the window of his patrol car on @entity75			1
at one point , @entity8 tries to turn the tables on the pair , saying that he was nice enough not to stop him on the highway , even though they were doing 65mph in a 45mph zone , but @entity6 quickly points out that the cop was driving at the same rate of speed			2
