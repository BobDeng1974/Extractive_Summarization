philosopher @entity0 states there are two ' beliefs ’ - religious and factual - that co-exist because we can form ' secondary cognitive attitudes ' proponents of science and devout disciples of religions around the world regularly clash about their views			1
but @entity12 - based philosopher @entity0 believes it may be possible for seemingly conflicting views to overlap , and for people to believe in aspects of both - so long as we reassess what we mean by the term ‘ belief			1
’ in his latest paper he writes that there are two interpretations of the word ' belief ' - one religious and another factual			2
professor @entity28 compares the belief in religion with the way our brains handle imaginative play			2
in his essay ‘ religious credence is not factual belief ’ , he uses an example describing a situation where a child is playing with a @entity39 cookie			1
the child knows it is made of @entity39 because it is ' tangible and evident ' - they have a factual belief in what it physically is			2
however , the child can suspend a certain amount of reality to imagine the cookie is real for the purposes and context of the game			0
another , more complex example quoted in the paper , is to imagine a statue falling from a boat into the ocean			0
professor @entity0 writes that people typically imagine the statue sinking			2
they do this because factual beliefs form the basis , and supplies missing information , for any outcomes while imagining the scenario			0
but people asked to imagine the scene do n’t factually believe a statue is currently sinking into the sea because if they did , they would alert the authorities and take action to stop it from doing so – even though the scenario is hypothetical			0
professor @entity0 describes a situation where a child is playing with @entity39 cookies			1
the child knows it is made of @entity39 because it is tangible ; they have a factual belief in it			0
however , they suspend a reality to imagine the cookie is real , for the purposes of the game			0
this can be applied to relgiion and science this belief system is reliant on human capacity to generate ' secondary cognitive attitudes ' , explained the philosopher			1
professor @entity0 said imaginative representations , such as religious views , co-exist with a factual belief , such as those held by scientists , or ' thoughts about reality ' , without being confused with it professor @entity0 said this suggests the distinction between the beliefs only works one way – and that there is ‘ is an anti-symmetric relation ’ between factual belief and imagining , which the philosopher calls cognitive governance			1
professor @entity0 believes this is a significant distinction , and it can be applied to religion versus science			2
with this theory it is possible for the human brain to imagine and hypothesise about religious teachings , while also believing in evolution when looking at evidence to suggest as much			1
in his paper ‘ religious credence is not factual belief ’ , @entity12 - based philosopher @entity120 describes a situation where a child is playing with a @entity39 cookie			1
the child knows it is made of @entity39 because it is tangible and evident ; they have a factual belief in it			0
however , the child can suspend a certain amount of reality to imagine the cookie is real for the purposes and context of the game			0
professor @entity0 believes there is a distinction , and it can be similarly applied , in principle , to religion versus science			2
he states it is possible for the human brain to imagine and hypothesise about religious teachings , while also believing evolution happened when looking at evidence to suggest as much			1
this is reliant on human capacity to generate ‘ secondary cognitive attitudes ’ and that imaginative representations co-exist with a layer of factual belief - also known as thoughts about reality - without being confused with it			1
this , he says , relies on the human ability to generate ‘ secondary cognitive attitudes ’ and that imaginative representations co-exist with a layer of factual belief without being confused by either			1
professor @entity0 , using the example of children again , said that during any pretend play a child has two ' maps ' - one representing what he or she takes to be reality and another representing the contents of a fantasy world			1
‘ she uses the two maps in conjunction , since she must pretend in the physical space of the real world , ' continued professor @entity0			0
' but she does not confuse them , contrary to popular myth			0
‘ we see a similar structure - two maps - in the relation between religious representations and factual beliefs			0
‘ there is a corresponding myth to be debunked : quite simply , the myth that the two maps are run together - that there is only one kind of “ belief			0
” ’ addressing concerns that , by looking at belief in this way , causes religion to be linked with fiction , professor @entity0 wrote : ‘ this conclusion is startling , causing us to ask : how can something so serious as religion be rooted in the same capacity that yields something as frivolous as fiction ? ‘ but the question contains a misguided assumption			2
' humans , in fact , take many fictions incredibly seriously			0

the claims are presented by @entity12 - based philosopher @entity120
he states there are two interpretations for ' belief ’ - religious and factual
professor @entity0 compares religious belief with imaginative play
for example , a child playing with a @entity39 cookie knows not to bite it
it imagines it **'s** a cookie , while playing , but factually believes it **'s** not real
the same can be applied to religious and factual beliefs
put simply , it is possible to imagine and hypothesise about religious teachings , while believing evolution happened
this is based on our *mental* capacity to form ' secondary cognitive attitudes '
