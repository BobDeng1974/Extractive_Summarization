he said : ' we are seeing very low numbers of them now , as well as small bumble bees , which is a sign they have n't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on			2
' however it is not all bad news in the insect world , with creatures that thrive in damp conditions doing well over the wet months			2
wasps feed on aphids , which are also in decline due to the weather , which leads to a knock - on effect in the food chain it 's not all bad news : glow - worms are having a strong year , thanks to the proliferation of slugs and snails @entity32 said drone flies and mosquitoes , and snails and slugs , have seen population booms			2
