by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 10:12 est , 3 november 2012 these incredible new images of @entity2 , taken on 6 june by the high - resolution stereo camera on @entity6 ’s @entity5 spacecraft , show the stunning beauty of the @entity2 landscape - and reveal the telltale signs that water was once commonplace on the red planet , and could still be there in huge underground glaciers			1
they show the rugged terrain of @entity15 , an area that marks the far northern extent of @entity17 , one of the largest impact basins on @entity2			1
@entity15 stretches almost 1150 km and was named by the noted @entity21 astronomer @entity20 ( 1870 – 1944 )			0
the new images captured by @entity5 show a portion of the region , displaying multiple fluvial , glacial and wind - driven features			1
extensive drainage patterns can be seen towards the north ( lower right side ) of the first images , were formed when liquid water drained into deeper regions within the area			0
' on @entity55 , tree - like channels of this kind are usually formed by surface runoff after significant rainfall , or when snow or ice melts , ' @entity6 said in a statement			1
' similar processes are thought to have occurred on @entity2 in the distant past , when scientists now know there to have been water on the surface of the @entity2			1
' several of the craters within the region , particularly in eastern parts ( lower section ) of the first image , show concentric crater fill , a distinctive martian process marked by rings of surface fluctuations within a crater rim , the researchers say			2
the ratios between the diameter and depth of the filled craters suggest that there may still be water ice , possibly in the form of ancient glaciers , present below the dry surface debris cover			2
scientists have estimated that the water - ice depth in these craters varies from several tens up to hundreds of metres			1
@entity90 crater fill can be seen in many of the craters towards the east ( lower part of the image )			0
undulations in crater floors are commonly seen in mid-latitude regions on @entity2 and are believed to be a result of glacial movement			2
in the image above , a smooth area to the east of ( below ) the glacial feature appears to be the youngest within the image , evidenced by an almost complete lack of cratering			0
another indication of subsurface water is seen in the fluidised ejecta blanket surrounding the crater at the northern edge ( right - hand side )			0
these ejecta structures can develop when a comet or asteroid hits a surface saturated with water or water ice , @entity6 scientists say			2
the researchers say the images could also help plan where humans could eventually visit			0
' in - depth studies of regions such as @entity15 play an essential role in unlocking the geological past of our terrestrial neighbour , as well as helping to find exciting regions for future robotic and human explorers to visit			0
' taken on 6 june 2012 , the colour coding enhances the visibility of the rippling sand dunes which formed in the wind - sheltered sides of the mounds and canyons			1
a 3d image of the same are which shows off the depths of the craters centred at around 40 ° s and 310 ° e , the image has a ground resolution of about 23 m per pixel			0
in the foreground near to the crater , a mud or ice - landslide is seen , possibly due to glacial processes video : @entity6 's @entity5 found layers of water ice and dust at the @entity2 north pole ...			1

images show one of the largest impact basins on @entity2 , known as @entity15
show multiple fluvial , glacial and wind - driven features - and scientists believe there could still be ice under the surface in some of the craters
