by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 01:55 est , 20 june 2012 even the most ardent chocoholic would be repelled by this @entity2 which was infested a colony of ants			0
horrified grandmother @entity5 was just about to take a bite of the @entity7 sweet when she noticed one of the insects emerge from the wrapping			1
the thought is making my skin crawl			0
‘ i was having a wee break from work and i ate one of the eggs , which was fine , and put the other one down on the table			0
‘ my granddaughter @entity32 , who is 12 , was there and i asked her if she wanted one but thankfully she said no. ‘ half an hour later , i picked up the second egg and noticed ants on the table			2
it was then i saw an ant coming out of the seam of the egg ’s foil paper			2
i got the egg , ran outside , split it open , and was horrified to find there was a colony of ants inside - about 50 or 60 of them			1
‘ it was sickening - to think either my granddaughter or i could have put it in our mouth is disgusting			0
’ mrs @entity5 videoed the egg before treating it with fly spray and returning it to the shop , where she claims the only compensation she was offered was a £ 1 refund on the chocolate			1
horror : mrs @entity5 has vowed never to eat her favourite treat ever again after she found a colony of ants in her @entity2 she said : ‘ i felt like i was being dismissed			1
i could n’t eat my tea that night - it was horrible			0
now , i have been steam cleaning my house because i ’m terrified it ’s infested			0
’ mrs @entity5 , who runs a dog kennels , had decided to treat herself to chocolate and bought the confectionery at a shop near her home in @entity68 , @entity69			1
having eaten one of the two eggs , she was baffled when she left the other on the table and came back to find it crawling with the insects			1
a spokesman for the @entity77 , where mrs @entity5 bought the chocolate , said the store ’s supply of @entity81 had been removed immediately after she had alerted them to the problem			1
he said : ‘ @entity83 were shocked when they discovered what she was telling them			2
the eggs were taken off sale immediately and destroyed			0
sweet : how a @entity2 should look ‘ they could n’t find any other eggs with the problem - it may have been an isolated incident where the problem arose at any point of sale - but we do take these matters seriously			0
‘ the customer left before staff had the chance to explain to her that the eggs were being removed			0
‘ if she contacts us , we would like to offer our apologies directly			0
’ a spokesman for @entity106 , which manufactures the eggs , added : ‘ this sounds like an extremely unpleasant experience for mrs @entity5			1
‘ given these would have left our factory some months ago , this infestation has not happened within our control			1
‘ however , we ask mrs @entity5 to send the products back to us so we can investigate further			2

@entity5 , 52 , was about to bite into her chocolate treat when she discovered a writhing ball of insects inside
the grandmother has *slammed* the offer of a £ 1 refund from the shop where she bought the egg
@entity7 owners @entity106 say the infestation happened after the sweet left the factory
