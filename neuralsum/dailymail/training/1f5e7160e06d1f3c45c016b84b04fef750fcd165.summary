by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 06:31 est , 12 october 2012 a political debate turned physical in @entity2 yesterday as one of the two @entity5 candidates for congress grabbed the other by the shoulder , challenging him to a fight			1
@entity10 and @entity11 were mid-debate when mr @entity10 suddenly grabbed his opponent and shouted : ‘ you want to get into this ? ’ the heated moment came during a debate at a college in @entity18 , @entity19 , as the pair stepped up their game in the competition for a @entity25 seat			1
opponents : congressmen @entity10 , left , and @entity11 , right , debate at a @entity28 in @entity2 the day before the ' fight ' a video of the tussle was released on @entity11 ’s @entity33 account by his campaign manager , accompanied with a press release headlined ‘ has @entity10 lost his mind ? ’ , which led to the opposing side accusing them of a smear campaign			1
what the video does not show is that moments earlier , during a dispute on an immigration - related bill , mr @entity11 , 71 , the ranking @entity46 on the @entity47 , had called mr @entity10 ‘ delusional ’ and ‘ liar ’			1
congressman @entity49 , seen on the left in the video , then stepped close to mr @entity10 , 57 , on the stage , who told his colleague loudly , ‘ get out of my face			1
’ a few seconds later in mr @entity10 is seen taking a hold of mr @entity11 in front of an increasingly riled audience			1
the two men later stood nose - to - nose exchanging words before a sheriff 's deputy emerged behind them and briefly placed his hand on @entity10 's shoulder after which the pair separated			1
firestarter : the debate between the congressmen get heated as the pair square up against each other at the close of the debate , held at @entity71 , @entity18 , @entity49 said : ‘ we are in a heated and expensive race			1
it 's become a very emotional race			0
' we [ each ] think that when smears are made , and when untruths are said , a person has to defend himself and that raises the intensity of debate			0
’ the move by @entity11 ’s team to release the video is just the latest stunt in an increasingly nasty campaign for congress			1
it has seen a series of competing accusations , ranging from suggestions of ethical impropriety to fleecing taxpayers			0
earlier thursday , two former secretaries of state , @entity96 and @entity97 , released a letter defending @entity49 for taking overseas trips following criticism from @entity10 's campaign			1
in response to the video , @entity102 , mr @entity10 's campaign manager , refuted the claims that congressman @entity10 attacked his opponent			2
‘ @entity10 did not challenge @entity49			2
congressman @entity10 was reacting to @entity49 leaving his table , coming over to where @entity10 's was seated and calling him a " liar " and " delusional			2
" ' mr @entity102 said that congressman @entity10 asked his opponent to step away and the grab was a result of mr @entity11 refusing to do so			1
’ ' you want to get into this ? ' : congressman @entity10 puts his arm around his opponents shoulder and shouts in his face release : the woman grabs mr @entity10 's arm and he lets go of congressman @entity49 's shoulder he added : ‘ clearly the context is that @entity10 is upset that @entity49 has come over to where @entity10 was and is getting in his face and calling him names			2
@entity10 is asking @entity49 why he is behaving the way he is			2
’ mr @entity102 also accuses congressman @entity49 ’s campaign manager @entity130 of turning the exchange ‘ into something it was not			0
' ‘ @entity130 's release makes a number of misstatements and exaggerations			0
@entity10 did not put @entity49 in a headlock			2
a sheriff did not escort @entity10 from the premises			0
both parties calmed down and the debate continued			0
’ ‘ not a good day for a consultant when you have to deny that your candidate put someone in a headlock			0
‘ get a load of this guy : mr @entity10 continues to attack with a raised voice having let go of mr @entity11 @entity152 to head : the pair go against each other once more on stage two ways : an officer and the moderator go between them and the pair separate mr @entity10 himself said in a statement that the debate ‘ was not conducted at the highest level			1
' he said : ' i regret my part in allowing emotions to distract from the exchange of views			0
’ the veteran lawmakers were pulled into the same district after a voter - approved independent panel redrew @entity2 's political boundaries			0
they were the top vote - getters in the june primary and went on to the general election because of @entity2 's new primary system , which sends the top two finishers to the runoff regardless of party affiliation			0
their race for the 30th district seat is one of eight same - party congressional runoffs on @entity2 's november ballot			0
another , in the @entity188 , involves @entity5 rep. @entity190 , the longest - serving member of the state 's congressional delegation .			0
