koalas have a unique voice box that allows them to make a ' belching ' call that only large animals like elephants are capable of koalas might look cute but they have a unique voice box that allows them to make a ‘ belching ’ call that only large animals like elephants are capable of			1
the @entity12 marsupial ’s mating call is about 20 times lower in pitch than it should be , given its relatively small size , new research has found			1
while the creature ’s ability to make the noise has baffled scientists for years , they now believe they have discovered the koala ’s secret - a specialised sound - producing organ that has never before been seen in any other land - dwelling mammal			1
the key feature of this newly described organ is its location outside the voice box or the larynx			2
dr @entity29 of the @entity30 , who led the research , said : ‘ we have discovered that koalas possess an extra pair of vocal folds that are located outside the larynx , where the oral and nasal cavities connect			1
‘ we also demonstrated that koalas use these additional vocal folds to produce their extremely low - pitched mating calls			1
’ the male koala ’s bellow calls are produced as a continuous series of sounds on inhalation and exhalation , similar to that of a donkey ’s braying			0
on inhalation , koala bellows sound a bit like snoring , but when the animals exhale , the sound is more reminiscent of belching and dr @entity29 said : ‘ they are actually quite loud			0
’ the call is also incredibly low - pitched and more typical of an animal the size of an elephant			2
size is related to pitch as the dimensions of the laryngeal vocal folds normally constrain the lowest frequency that an animal can generate			1
as a result , smaller species will typically make higher pitched calls than larger ones			0

the call is incredibly low - pitched and more typical of an animal the size of an elephant			2
but koalas have bypassed that constraint as their vocal folds are in a different location , according to the study , which was published in journal @entity92			2
the folds are two long , fleshy lips in the soft palette , just above the larynx at the junction between the oral and nasal cavities			0
they look similar to the laryngeal vocal folds of other mammals , but their location is highly unusual			2
‘ to our knowledge , the only other example of a specialised sound - producing organ in mammals that is independent of the larynx are the phonic lips that toothed whales use to generate echolocation clicks , ’ dr @entity29 said			1
the combination of biological , video and acoustic data collected in the new study represents the first evidence in a terrestrial mammal of an organ other than the larynx that is dedicated to sound production			0
the scientists now plan on looking more closely at other mammals to find out whether this vocal adaptation is truly unique to koalas			0
