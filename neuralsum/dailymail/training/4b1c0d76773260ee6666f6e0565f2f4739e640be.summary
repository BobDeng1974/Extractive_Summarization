as a father of two young boys the one thing i dread is the infuriating battle of wills that breaks out whenever it is time to put on their coats and shoes to leave the house			1
so , when my wife suggested our first family skiing holiday the idea of kitting them out each morning in stubborn skiing boots , uncomfortable helmets , and easily lost gloves , goggles and lift passes made me develop a sudden enthusiasm for staying put in @entity22 and visiting lots of museums			1
i was overruled , of course , and so we headed for the @entity26			1
@entity28 and wife @entity29 and their two sons @entity27 ( left ) and @entity32 on the slopes of the @entity26 @entity26 the four - star @entity34 in @entity36 is the ideal base from which to explore @entity38 , the linked areas of @entity40 and @entity41 , offering 464 miles of pistes and 141 lifts i was looking forward to saying ' i told you so ' as the boys struggled at the equipment hire shop			1
my wife , @entity29 , who is a much more experienced skier than me , was wondering what all the fuss was about			2
thankfully i was proved wrong.the local ski hire staff were both thoughtful and slick and @entity27 , nine , and his seven year - old brother @entity32 were measured up and fully equipped along with a dozen other @entity53 children with astonishing speed and ease			2
our boys were waiting by the hire shop door eager to get on with the holiday frustrated only by their dad who was still struggling to get his boots on			1
@entity28 and with his wife @entity29 ( left ) and his sons @entity32 and @entity27 ( right ) enjoying their winter break we were staying at @entity68 's flagship four - star @entity34 in the charming resort of @entity36			1
this village sized , family - friendly destination benefits from the extensive facilities of the @entity40 resort of which it is a part , but is more relaxed and charming than some of the other more sprawling resort towns			1
it is an ideal base from which to explore @entity38 , the linked areas of @entity40 and @entity41 , offering 464 miles of pistes and 141 lifts			1
the hotel is modern and well equipped but does not suffer from the jarring ugliness of other large hotels in some @entity26 resorts			2
instead it nestles unobtrusively just a short walk from the atmospheric town centre			2
the @entity28 boys loved ski school and were swiftly measured up and fully equipped along with other children @entity28 found it a delight to watch his boys shepherded off to ski school in the morning the boys ' room , with en suite shower was huge and sunny			1
two balconies ( both with reassuringly high safety rails ) offered magnificent views across and down the pretty @entity101 and were a wonderful spot to enjoy afternoon tea			2
@entity27 and @entity32 chose to sleep together in a comfortable double sized sofa bed but there were facilities to sleep at least three more kids easily			2
there was plenty of room to hang damp ski clothes and to scatter toys brought from home			2
@entity29 and i were in an adjoining en suite bedroom - also surprisingly large , with modern furnishings , contemporary decor and a large bathroom with shower and bath			2
we were on the third floor , conveniently just along the corridor from the boot room from which you can ski straight on to the piste			2
rosy - cheeked and fearless : @entity32 , seven ( left ) and nine - year - old @entity27 on the balcony of their room the resort has a good - sized indoor swimming pool with a huge hot tub inside and another outside from which guests can admire the view and wave to skiers passing on a nearby gondola lift there is a good - sized indoor swimming pool with a huge hot tub inside and another outside from which you can admire the view and wave to skiers passing on a nearby gondola lift			1
@entity27 and @entity32 were always keen to go swimming – even after a long day skiing - and i found it a great way to relax			1
the peaceful spa , which overlooks the pool has a steam room and sauna and two highly skilled masseurs , trained to melt away the aches and pains			0
evening meals are organised so that children eat separately from their parents			0
i have heard sneering criticism of this kind of arrangement - cited as evidence that unlike others in @entity163 we @entity164 do n't really like our kids - what rot ! our children relished the chance to lark about and swap tales of derring - do with new pals they 'd made in ski school and would have been dead on their feet had they stayed up late enough to eat with us			0
the writer highly recommends the resort for those planning their their first family skiing holiday the ideally located resort had magnificent views across and down the pretty @entity101 to be honest after a long day skiing it was a relief to simply hand them over at the restaurant at around 6pm and leave the staff to shepherd them through the noisy and raucous meal knowing that we could enjoy a quiet and relaxing five course feast , with wine , once they 'd gone to bed			1
after dinner the fun continued for the children with lots of organised activities			0
you can sit back and let them run wild safe in the knowledge that they are loving every minute of it and are safe in the hands of the bright , young and enthusiastic staff who are all @entity53			0
when it is time for the kids to go to bed a member of staff keeps a reassuring eye on them until you turn in yourself			0
the ever present army of @entity68 staff are the hotel 's greatest asset			0
it was a delight to watch our boys shepherded off to ski school in the morning too busy and excited for goodbye kisses and good luck wishes			0
and what a joy to see them just two days into the holiday snaking their way down a blue run , rosy cheeked and fearless			1
as i looked on i was puffed up with fatherly pride and dying to give them a hug			0
at the @entity235 marvelling at the impressive ice sculptures in the @entity237 , or ice caves memorable holiday : @entity28 puffed up with fatherly pride when he saw how well his children were skiing i am not going to beat around the bush			1
if you are planning your first family skiing holiday and you want someone else to take the strain , you should stay here			1
our boys loved ski school in the morning and were happy to join us on the slopes after lunch			0
the nursery slopes are a good size for those who need to build confidence and access to them is easy and efficient			0
it was holiday packed with memories i will treasure all my life			1
on one exciting outing we took a trip up to the top of @entity235 at 3,417m to see the impressive ice sculptures in the @entity237 , or ice caves			0
@entity32 loves polar bears and was overjoyed to come face to face with one carved into to @entity267 run down was too difficult for me and the boys so we came down in the bubble car while my wife skied and met us for a hot chocolate lower down in the valley			0
this year i 'm sure the boys will be racing down with their mum - i 'll stick to the bubble car			0
