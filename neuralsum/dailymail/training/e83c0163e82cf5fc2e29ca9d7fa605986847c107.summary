con artists : for four years @entity8 , 41 , and @entity9 , 53 , duped close friends and relatives into handing over their life savings for stock market shares and bonds that did not exist in a @entity27 - style scam to maintain the illusion that the investments were paying off , some of the cash they took from investors was used to fund monthly returns to others - the modus operandi of a classic ' ponzi scheme '			1
@entity37 , a former bank manager , was jailed for five - and - a - half years , and stockbroker @entity9 received a seven - year sentence at @entity40 , @entity41 , yesterday			1
a judge heard the pair ran their bogus scheme from march 2006 to october 2010			0
they traded off their expertise in the financial markets to convince their victims they were running a genuine investment company called @entity51			0
they knew many of their 40 victims personally , and persuaded them to pour their life savings into the project , which they promised would deliver a guaranteed return of between two and five per cent per month			2
go directly to jail : after pleading guilty to investment fraud , @entity37 , a former bank manager , was jailed for five - and - a - half years , and stockbroker @entity9 received a seven - year sentence at @entity40 named after one of the most notorious conmen in @entity66 history , the @entity36 is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid selling			1
in its classic form , a @entity27 fraudster sets up a fund with a ' fail - safe ' business plan			0
investors join in their droves , lured by the huge returns on offer			0
but the fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes into the fund			2
eventually , all ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse under the weight of new money flooding in			2
the fraud was named after @entity27 , pictured above right in a 1910 police mugshot , an @entity87 who emigrated to @entity66 in 1903 with $ 2.50 in his pocket			0
after a spell in prison for fraud , he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the price of postage stamps in @entity87 and the @entity66 at the height of his success in 1920 , @entity27 was making $ 250,000 a day - a mammoth sum for the era			0
when his scheme collapsed , @entity27 pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison			0
the scheme ran along the lines of the fraudulent investment scam made infamous by @entity27 at the beginning of the @entity108 , paying returns to investors from the money paid by subsequent victims			0
but , the court heard , most of the cash was used to fund @entity9 's gambling habits and maintain lavish lifestyles for him and @entity37			1
when a growing number of clients started to ask for their money back in 2009 , @entity9 started offering them three month bonds , offering a guaranteed return of five per cent per month			1
it was not until late 2010 that the majority of investors realised that something was amiss			0
@entity9 and @entity37 tried to hold off disgruntled investors with excuses about the length of time to release money from offshore accounts			1
the fraud was brought to a halt in 2011 after clients upset at being unable to get their money back started to make complaints to police			0
after they were sentenced , detective constable @entity139 , from the @entity140 said : ' @entity9 and @entity37 conned their family and friends out of millions of pounds			1
' their clients trusted them to invest their money wisely and legally with the promise of solid returns on their capital			0
' what they did n’t realise , until it was too late , was @entity9 and @entity37 used the cash to fund their lifestyle			1
' they were happy to live off their family and friends ’ life savings without a care in the world			2
