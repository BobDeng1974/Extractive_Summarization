the 59 - year - old kept her hand in front of her face as she dashed to her waiting car			2
@entity0 donned a large animal print hat worn low over her face and shielded her eyes with large sunglasses			0

covering up : @entity0 wore black opaque stocking paired with a black dress and pointy shoes going incognito : the former model hid her face with an animal print hat worn low and large sunglasses out of the way , please : she appeared in no mood to engage with the camera , and sported a serious expression as she got into the backseat of her car @entity0 gave a tv interview on tuesday in which she alleged @entity3 invited her to dinner to discuss a role on @entity46 , offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps			1
that is one of the last things she remembers of the evening			0
' the next morning i woke up , and i was n't wearing my pajamas , and i remember before i passed out that i had been sexually assaulted by this man , ' she told @entity58			1
' i remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs			1
' shocking claim : supermodel @entity0 ( above ) has come forward to say she was drugged and rapped by @entity3 in 1982 bad guy : @entity0 says after @entity3 allegedly gave her the pill , the next thing she remembers is ' waking up with her pajamas off and semen between her legs ' @entity0 says her last memory of the night was of @entity3 taking off his robe and climbing on top of her , and that the next morning she remembers ' a lot of pain			1
' the supermodel claims the incident occurred in @entity76 , @entity77 in 1982			1
however , @entity3 's attorney , @entity78 , branded the allegation a ' complete lie			1
' she also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography , @entity85 on duty : the accidental life of the @entity89 's @entity88 , but that @entity3 and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details			1
but @entity78 also flatly rejected this claim , saying : ' you can confirm with @entity95 that she never claimed that mr @entity3 raped her , that no attorney representing @entity3 tried to kill the story ... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about @entity3 in her book			1
' in a statement , reported by @entity104 , he added : ' there is documentary proof that @entity0 is fabricating and lying about @entity3			1
' @entity3 answered the door in nothing but a white towel			1
he was fresh from the shower , too ; his black skin was glistening			0
he hugged me , a little too enthusiastically ; told me how much he 'd missed me , and how nice it was to see me			0
liquor does that to a girl			0
' @entity117 , you 're beautiful			0
' he kissed me , full on the lips , then went off to dress and we went downstairs , to dinner , where @entity3 spent the next two hours talking about himself			1
it was an evening with @entity3			1
and suddenly i remembered something @entity126 once told me			0
it was his definition of an actor			2
he said , ' an actor is a person whose eyes glaze over when the conversation is no longer about them			2
' and i thought , well , then , @entity3 is an actor 's actor			1
after dinner he asked me back to his room , and i went			0
but i stopped myself at the door			0
' i 'm exhausted , ' i said , begging off			0
his eyebrows went a little funny			0
' exhausted ? ' he asked , and it was clear he was trying hard to keep his temper in check			0
' after all i 've done for you , that 's what i get ? i 'm exhausted			0
' ' well , gee , @entity3 , ' i stammered			1
' if i had known it was going to be like this â€” ' he waved both hands in front of my face , silencing me			0
then he gave me the dirtiest , meanest look in the world , stepped into his suite , and slammed the door in my face			2
@entity0 detailed the events again of that evening in @entity76 back in 1982 @entity0 says she is coming forward now because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly , and that it is the ' right thing to do ' @entity0 did , however , detail some of her evening in @entity76 with @entity3 in the book , though telling a very different story			1
she said she was drinking with @entity3 at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired , at which point he slammed his door in her face			1
the aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story			2
she says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly , and that it is the ' right thing to do			2
' as for what she would say to @entity3 if she saw him , @entity0 does not mince words			2
' how dare you , ' she says			0
' go f * ck yourself			0
how dare you take advantage of me			0
and i hope you rot			0
' bombshell : at the time of the alleged rape , @entity0 ( pictured in the 1980s ) was one of the biggest models in the world this comes as a third women , @entity182 , came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by @entity3 in @entity8 back in 1969			1
she called him a ' very , very sick man who needs help			0
' another of @entity3 's accusers , @entity187 , told @entity188 she was just 17 when he ' brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure , and then assaulted me multiple times			2
' @entity3 , who refuses to comment on the allegations , did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior			1
his lawyer @entity196 has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated ' does not make them true			2

she claims in a new interview that she was drugged and raped by @entity3
she said the incident happened in @entity76 , @entity77 , in 1982 , and that the actor gave her a pill with a glass of wine , causing her to blackout
she says she woke up the next morning ' with her pajamas off , in pain , and with semen between her legs '
two other women have *recently* come forward to say they were raped and drugged by @entity3

but his attorney , @entity78 , has branded the allegation a ' complete lie '
