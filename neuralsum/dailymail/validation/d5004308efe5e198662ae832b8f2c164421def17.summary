a chicken which nearly died after it was savaged by a fox has recovered thanks to an innovative form of bird physiotherapy			1
seven - year - old @entity5 was attacked in the back garden of her owner @entity7 , and vets said she was ' almost split in two ' following her ordeal			1
mrs @entity7 resolved to do all she could to save the bird 's life , because she was the favourite pet of her late husband @entity13 , and spent five months nursing her back to health			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity25 in @entity20 , said : ' she clearly wanted to live and was n't going to let that fox beat her			1
' she was my late husband 's favourite , so that is where the extra feeling comes from			1
she is a little bit of him			0
' the couple bought @entity5 and another hen in 2008 because they could not find eggs which were both fresh and organic			0
but in november last year , she was suddenly grabbed by a fox while she was running free in the garden			0
treatment : @entity5 has since undergone a new form of avian physiotherapy to help her recover stretches : the treatment involves manipulating her limbs to enable her to walk normally again mrs @entity7 said : ' this fox came whizzing down the garden and grabbed her and dashed down the bottom of the garden			1
i screamed and i just had to try to stop the fox			0
' eventually , the fox did drop her and ran off but @entity5 was just laying there bleeding and there were feathers everywhere			2
' @entity5 was rushed to a nearby vet 's office , where @entity59 carried out emergency surgery to save her			1
but as the chicken recovered she was having difficulty walking because of the scar tissue which had formed over her wounds			0
@entity66 and hearty : the physio has apparently been a success and @entity5 is now back to full health ms @entity59 said : ' last year , @entity5 came in almost split in two and had to have quite major surgery to stitch her back together			0
' i had never heard of physiotherapy for chickens but she responded to it really well			0
' i 've only seen it done on chickens on @entity78 videos in @entity79			0
@entity5 is a very special hen and @entity7 looks after her very well			2
' mrs @entity7 also took @entity5 to a pet blessing service as church , which she says helped to speed her recovery .			2
