@entity14 ' @entity13 was sentenced to 13 years prison in 2000 for armed robbery
he got bail and appealed the sentence *unsuccessfully* several times
he should have been *re-arrested* and jailed following his last failed appeal but he never was
over the last 13 years @entity13 *reformed* , becoming a master carpenter , business owner , *husband* , and father of four
he was arrested after the @entity91 went to release him from prison and realized he was n't there
he is now nine months into his sentence
some 30,000 people have signed a petition asking for him to be freed
@entity13 said he is *shocked* by the support of *strangers*
the state wants him to serve the original sentence , meaning he 'll be 50 and his children grown by the time he is released
