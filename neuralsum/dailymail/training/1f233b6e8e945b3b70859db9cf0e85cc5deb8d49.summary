by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 12:59 est , 18 october 2013 in a move that adds new meaning to the term surfing the web , researchers are working on creating a ' deep - sea internet '			1
a team of scientists from @entity10 have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in @entity13 , and are now hoping to create an industry standard for underwater communications in the world 's seas and oceans			1
the technology could be used to send data between submarines , for example , collect and send data from the sea floor to help detect tsunamis and other disasters sooner , as well as monitor fish and mammal numbers			1
a team of scientists from @entity10 have begun testing an underwater @entity31 network			2
the system involves data being sent to and from two 40lb sensors , pictured , using sound waves			1
the data can be sent in real - time from a laptop and the sensors have a wider underwater range than current radio wave technology does traditional networks , used on land , use radio waves to send data through satellites and antennae			1
radio waves have a weak range underwater so agencies such as the @entity50 and @entity51 ( @entity51 ) use sound wave - based methods to communicate underwater			1
@entity55 's system sends commands and data from a laptop to two 40lb sensors placed on the sea bed			2
these commands are converted into sound waves that transmit data back to laptops and other wireless devices in real - time			1
other examples given by the team , led by @entity55 , associate professor of electrical engineering at the @entity68 , include offshore oil and natural gas exploration , surveillance , pollution monitoring and more			0
' a submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time , ' said @entity55			0
' making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer , especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs , could help save lives			0
' traditional networks , used on land , use radio waves to send data through satellites and antennae			2
radio waves have a weak range underwater so agencies such as the @entity50 and @entity51 ( @entity51 ) use sound wave - based methods to communicate underwater			2
for example , @entity51 relies on acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to surface buoys			1
the buoys convert the acoustic waves into radio waves to send the data to a satellite , which then redirects the radio waves back to land - based computers - a slow and lengthy process			2
@entity55 's system would solve this problem by sending data between a network of underwater sensors to laptops , smartphones and other wireless devices in real - time using sound waves			1
electrical engineering students including @entity122 , pictured , have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in @entity13 , pictured			2
the team hopes to use the technology to detect tsunamis more accurately , monitor the levels of fish and mammals , search for natural gas and more during tests , @entity133 , left , and @entity135 , right , sent a command to the sensors			0
they knew it had been successful when the soundwaves ricocheted off a nearby concrete wall @entity55 recently tested the system in @entity13 by dropping two , 40lb sensors into the water			0
@entity145 and @entity135 typed a command into a laptop that was transmitted to the sensors			0
a series of high - pitched chirps bounced off a nearby concrete wall seconds later , indicating that the command had been received by the sensors and activated the sound from the sensor			0
a deep - sea internet could , for example , join networks of buoys together that can detect tsunamis quicker and more reliably than current methods , said @entity55			1
it could also be used by the energy industry to search for underwater oil and natural gas			0
' we could even use it to monitor fish and marine mammals , and find out how to best protect them from shipping traffic and other dangers , ' @entity55 continued			0
' an internet underwater has so many possibilities			0
' @entity55 's work is detailed in the @entity176 : an ip - compatible @entity177 for @entity180 paper being presented at the annual @entity181 in @entity182 in november .			0

researchers successfully sent data on an underwater network in @entity13
system uses sound waves to communicate like those used by *dolphins*
the team hope to use the technology to create a ' deep - sea internet '
it could send data from the ocean bed to *predict* tsunamis , for example
