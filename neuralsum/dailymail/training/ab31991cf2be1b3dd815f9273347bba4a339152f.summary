' his comments were widely reported but , but on monday night @entity2 gave a statement to the @entity48 reporter saying he had been misunderstood			2
he said : ' what i meant was that whenever sex or graphic nudity of any kind ( gay or straight ) is gratuitous to the plot or story it becomes a little too much for my taste '			2
in an interview immediately after his first , controversial statements , he also told a reporter perhaps he should n't have said anything at all			0
he is pictured above at the january 18 event he declined to cite any examples of the too - explicit shows , but implied that intolerant attitudes he struggled with while playing @entity70 from 1977 to 1981 have now swung the other way			1

' so , yeah , it was awkward			0
' ' i did it in front of a live audience and there were times when i would say to @entity78 , " i love you , " and the audience would laugh nervously			0
' i wanted to stop the taping and go , " what is your problem ? " ' however , @entity2 later rowed back on his comments and said : ' maybe i should n't have said anything today '			2

you ca n’t say this , you ca n’t say that , you ca n’t offend this group , that group			0
