@entity1 presidential candidate @entity0 on wednesday disputed the @entity3 's claim that all 54 votes from the continent will go to incumbent @entity6 in the presidential elections next month			1
the former @entity9 international , in @entity10 at the @entity11 to canvass for votes , told @entity13 he did not believe all @entity14 was solidly behind @entity6 , who seeks re-election on may 29 against @entity0 , @entity16 of @entity17 and the @entity19 football association president @entity18			1
' i feel there 's a lot of respect for @entity3 among all the @entity14 federations but i 'm positive that ( @entity3 president ) mr ( @entity26 ) @entity25 did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation , ' said the former @entity31 and @entity32 midfielder			2
@entity0 does not believe that @entity6 will receive all 54 votes from @entity14 nations @entity6 ( left ) has received the backing of @entity14 football 's president @entity25 ( right ) ' even when he ( @entity25 ) announced he would support @entity39 , we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation			1
' this time we heard just a normal applause , which confirms my idea that a lot of @entity14 countries understand and agree with the need to change for the better of everyone , especially the national associations			0
' in fact there were federation presidents who ensured me they would vote for me but they were reluctant to saying this out loud because they feared reactions against them , their federations and even their countries , ' said @entity0			0
' it also to end this kind of atmosphere that i decided to be a candidate			0
football should be about a beautiful game and people should be able to express themselves freely and openly			0
' @entity0 ( left ) and @entity67 ( right ) are opposing @entity6 and have chosen to run for presidency prince @entity16 is the third challenger and the @entity1 vice-president was in attendance in @entity71 the @entity3 congress in @entity73 ended on tuesday with @entity25 declaring @entity14 's complete support for @entity6 's re-election but on all previous occasions when the @entity3 chief has promised a block of @entity14 votes , many have broken ranks			1
when @entity6 came to power in 1998 , @entity25 pledged @entity14 's votes to rival @entity84 of @entity85 but most defied him to vote @entity6 into power			2
when @entity25 stood against @entity6 in 2002 , almost half the @entity14 countries voted for the @entity88 rather than their own confederation president .			0

@entity0 is challenging to *replace* @entity6 as @entity1 president
former @entity9 star does *n't* believe all of @entity3 's ( @entity3 ) 54 votes will decide in @entity6 's *favour*
prince @entity16 and @entity18 are also in the running
