mister money is now putting his money where his mouth is			0
@entity4 has commissioned a mouthguard not only imbedded with his usual diamond and gold bling but stuffed with $ 100 bills			1
total cost , according to his favourite website @entity10 , is $ 25,000			1
@entity4 ( left ) vs @entity12 in the official advert for their mega-fight on may 2 pay - per - view watchers in @entity17 will have to pay up to $ 100 ( £ 67.48 ) to watch the fight @entity12 posted a picture of him doing yoga on monday as part of his preparation for the big fight @entity4 works in his gym as the fight with @entity12 draws closer as the value of the richest fight of all time keeps rising ever closer to the half - billion mark , so does the value of @entity12 ’s target			1
if the @entity12 does land the knockout blow , then given the expensive protection at least the @entity34 should wake up smiling			1
@entity4 has just spent $ 300,000 on yet another vehicle , according to his favourite website @entity10			1
this is a @entity38 ’ people carrier to which he has added such extras as a 55 - inch television and a champagne bar , to turn it into what he calls his ‘ @entity43			1
’ and so it turns out that all the time @entity46 was talking about coming to @entity47 for a rematch with @entity49 he was setting up yet another easy night out in his own backyard			1
only a couple of days after the self - called @entity46 declared he would be prepared to cross the @entity52 to face the @entity53 , @entity46 revealed that his overdue ring comeback will be taking place in his @entity57 hometown on june 20			1
the opponent ? most likely a certain @entity59 , who turned up in questionable condition to face @entity61 and was promptly knocked out in that final eliminator for @entity66 ’s @entity65 super-middleweight title			0
@entity46 is set to make his overdue ring comeback in his hometown on june 20 so much for wanting to do it a second time with @entity49 to unify the @entity71 ’s two world championship belts			1
that fight had been ordered by the @entity71 and @entity49 ’s promoter @entity73 did his best to come to terms before the march 31 deadline now @entity46 ’s announcement has made it yet more likely that @entity49 might retire			2
@entity46 had claimed a readiness to overcome his phobia – either fear of flying or of fighting abroad			2
he would n’t go as far as @entity49 ’s home city of @entity82 but he did express a willingness to travel to @entity84 for a showdown at either @entity86 or the 02			0
his argument was that his @entity17 victory over @entity49 in the final of the @entity91 super-middleweight tournament took place in @entity93 , not @entity94			0
so @entity84 would be fairer than @entity82			0
still , @entity49 doubted he was serious and was apparently right to do so			0
it is back to home sweet home for @entity46 , at the @entity97 across the bay from @entity99			2
if not exactly the offspring of the @entity101 , @entity46 is a favourite son of @entity17 boxing			1
so the @entity71 appear compliant , with no sign yet of him being stripped of his belt			0
@entity105 is unlikely to get his dream fight against @entity46 or @entity107 @entity46 remains atop the ratings as their ‘ super ’ champion , with @entity49 still the ‘ regular ’ world titlist			1
maybe the @entity71 are giving him license to shake off the ring rust after being out of the ring since his points win over another undistinguished foe , @entity117 , way back in november 2013			0
yet @entity46 ’s inactivity has long since become more a result of self - inflicted promotional disputes than his original injury			2
now he is the first major signing by the new kids on that block , the music industry - backed @entity125 , who are trying to confirm not only the opponent for june 20 but a tv deal			0
that the television rights have not been snapped up instantly by either of the major networks @entity132 or @entity133 speaks to @entity46 ’s sluggish box office appeal despite the high professional regard for his skills			2
the closest he has come to properly fighting abroad has been a couple of low - key outings to the @entity139			0
that he so much as contemplated travelling several thousand miles to face @entity49 indicates a realisation that he could make a lot more money in @entity47			0
still , that temptation is not enough			0
he carries on talking about the @entity53 later			0
but as it stands one of @entity49 ’s dreams for his farewell appearance – boxing at the @entity150 home of @entity151 – has been dashed			2
the other ambition – a fight in @entity154 – hangs on @entity107 coming through an interim bout and agreeing to meet him there in september			1
but @entity49 says : ‘ unless i get a fight that excites me soon i may well hang up the gloves			0
’ @entity46 , meanwhile , talks about meeting the challenge of middleweight ko sensation @entity160 ‘ soon '			2
@entity4 says : ‘ for me , @entity46 beats him every day of the week			1
' the questions , @entity46 , are which day ? and where ? the @entity65 still insist that @entity163 , who has yet to confirm @entity164 or anyone else as his may 30 opponent , turned down a fight with @entity168 as a final eliminator for @entity171 ’s world welterweight title			1
one question for the @entity65 : why would @entity163 bother with an eliminator when @entity171 is gagging to meet him in a @entity174 ? @entity163 's proposed fight with @entity164 is yet to be confirmed			0

@entity4 will have $ 25,000 mouthguard for @entity12 bout
the mouthguard to contain diamonds , gold and $ 100 *dollar* bills
he also spent $ 300,000 on @entity186 ' @entity38 ' people carrier
@entity105 unlikely to meet @entity46 or @entity107
