' the council should be looking at training and using some of their existing staff to temporary fill in rather than bringing in staff at a ridiculous cost to the taxpayer			0
' @entity78 , leader of the @entity79 in @entity2 , said : ' interim staff is quite acceptable providing they are temporary and once they go beyond what is a reasonable timeframe for a temporary member of staff , they should not be in post			2

' councils are under financial pressure and on occasion it 's in the financial best interests to fill a post with an interim because it gives us greater flexibility			0
' we can only appoint somebody full - time if we can find the right person to fill the role and we are confident that role is going to be retained in any future organisation			0
