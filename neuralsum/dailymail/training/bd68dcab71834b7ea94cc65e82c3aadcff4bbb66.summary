but @entity0 , who also ran a security company while claiming incapacity benefits and disability living allowance , was spared jail at @entity1 yesterday			1
magistrates handed him an eight - week jail term suspended for six months after he admitted two counts of failing to notify a change in circumstances			1
chair of the bench @entity30 said @entity0 was spared jail because of his early guilty plea			1
he said : ' this is a custodial sentence but we are prepared to suspend it on the condition you do not commit any further offences			0
' we pass this sentence because of the length of time the offences were committed over and the substantial amount of money which was taken from the system			0
after his sentence was handed down surprised @entity0 asked magistrates if he could leave the court			1
he said : ' i 'm free to go now ? ' @entity60 told the court @entity0 had claimed his arthritis was so bad he was placed in the ' virtually unable to walk ' category and awarded a higher level of benefits			2
she said : ' mr @entity0 was capable of undertaking activity that appeared to be incompatible with his benefits			2
' he was capable of coaching boxing and the club confirmed he was self - employed with his day and night security business			2
' with regards to his disability allowance his last self - assessment was in 1999			2
' he said that due to arthritis in his right knee he was very disabled and needed care and often found it very difficult to walk without a walking stick			0
' he said his walking ability was restricted to 100 yards which would take him ten minutes to walk this distance			0
' an allegation was received that mr @entity0 was capable to walk and that he had a security firm			2

' we have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them			0
