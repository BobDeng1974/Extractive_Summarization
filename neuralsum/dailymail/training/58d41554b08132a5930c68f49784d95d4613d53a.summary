the links between where you live and the adverse affects on your health are well documented			0
busy roads , power plants and a dense urban neighbourhoods all increase a person 's exposure to air pollution , and secondhand smoke - raising the risk of stroke , heart disease and cancer			0
but location is also thought to be vital when it comes to the health of your skin			0
a new study has found a person 's postcode could determine their risk of developing eczema - a painful skin complaint affecting one in five people			1
skincare company @entity30 examined almost 24,000 orders for treatments to help ease the condition in adults and children			2
and their findings highlighted a direct correlation between hard water and demand for eczema cures			1
in the last 18 months , demand for treatments was highest in @entity43 , with the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 also appearing in the top five			1
experts noted all are areas of very hard water			1
click here to take the test skincare company @entity30 has developed an online portal allowing people to discover if they are at increased risk of eczema because of the water in the area where they live			1
by entering your postcode on the site , you can discover the hardness of your water supply the only exception in the top five was @entity67 , an area of soft water			1
the lowest levels of demand for eczema treatments were in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 - all areas with soft water , according to @entity78			1
and the company has now devised an online portal to enable people to check the water in their area			2
dermatologists and the @entity84 recognise hard water is a common trigger for exacerbating eczema			1
the skin requires a certain level of moisture , fats and oils to lubricate the skin , retain water and keep the skin plump			2
past studies have found eczema sufferers often do n't produce the necessary levels to maintain healthy skin			2
when the skin is dry , gaps can appear between the cells , allowing germs , bacteria and allergens to get through and cause irritation			0
that irritation can trigger the symptoms of eczema - itchy , red , inflamed , cracked and sore skin			1
some chemicals can aggravate the condition , with sufferers finding certain detergents , soaps and perfumes can cause problems , stripping the skin of its natural oils			1
hard water contains a considerable amount of dissolved minerals , such as calcium and magnesium , whereas soft water only contains sodium			1
it can also be responsible for scum on dishes and bathtubs as the minerals make soap less effective			0
dr @entity133 , medical director at @entity134 said these minerals lessen moisture levels in our skin , which , in turn , can aggravate skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis			2
on top of this - in areas with soft water , people use less soap , shampoo and washing powder on a daily basis , which therefore moderates skin contact to harsh chemicals and potential irritants			1
bio-medical research scientist , dr @entity154 , founder of @entity30 , said : ' from a scientific point of view the idea that hard water will have an effect on eczema makes sense on paper			1
' i have always believed that it formed part of a wider mix of external factors affecting the prevalence of eczema			2
' where hard water exists , an often invisible layer of minerals deposit on the skin after bathing or washing			1
' where the skin barrier function is deficient , these alkali deposits can irritate skin and cause inflammation and itching in the same way that other allergens such as chlorine and pollens cause the same sort of problems			0
' while the top three areas , showing highest demand for eczema products , all have big populations the sales are not directly related to population size			1
@entity192 , which is also in the top 10 , has roughly the same population as @entity195 , which comes in the bottom 50			0
the links between hard water and eczema have long been debated by scientists			1
a study by the @entity201 in the @entity202 in 2010 failed to prove if a water softener in the homes of children with eczema helped to reduce the severity of the condition			1
however , an earlier study by professor @entity133 of @entity210 in 1998 , found eczema is up to 44 per cent more common in primary school children living in hard water areas , than in those who live in areas where the water is soft			1
@entity217 also identified hard water as an environmental trigger of eczema , in its 2007 guidelines on atopic eczema in children			1
commenting on the findings of the 2009 @entity225 , @entity226 , from the @entity202 @entity227 , said : ' while this trial did not provide the supporting evidence expected , 66 per cent of home owner participants opted to purchase the water softener after the trial			0
highest incidence of eczema 1			0
@entity239 - slightly to moderately hard lowest incidence of eczema 1			2
@entity244 - slightly to moderately hard 6			2
@entity246 - soft eczema causes itchy , red , inflamed , cracked and sore skin			1
mother - of - one @entity249 said her daughter started to suffer with the painful condition , pictured on her arms , when she was just 10 months old			0
cases are usually diagnosed within the first few weeks or months of life ' in addition , water softener suppliers continue to receive customer reports of improvement in eczema conditions after a water softener has been installed			0
' mother - of - one @entity249 , from @entity261 - an area of hard water - said she saw a difference in her 10 - month - old daughter 's eczema in just four weeks , after installing a water softener			1
she said : ' i started to see a difference in my daughter 's skin in a month , and after two months , her eczema had cleared up completely			0
' previously , her eczema would be exacerbated when she was hot , and at bath - time – even if we just used water			1
' dr @entity154 added : ' these sales figures clearly illustrate that customers living in areas of hard water in the @entity202 are buying more products to treat eczema , than those living in areas of soft water			1
' the analysis carried out by @entity287 included sales from the @entity289 , which has five products including a daily spray , a cream and three bath time products , as well as the adult range of products			2
@entity30 products contain nutrient based formulations which help to support the skin 's natural healing process , effectively delivering proven active ingredients into the skin and restoring moisture			2
@entity304 , consultant dermatologist and @entity306 spokeswoman , said : ' there is increasing evidence that children living in areas with domestic hard water have an increased risk of eczema and more severe eczema especially if they have a genetically inherited tendency to dry skin			1
' the reasons for this have not been fully elucidated but using increased amounts of soap to produce the same lather contributes			0
" and @entity322 , dermatology nurse consultant and @entity306 spokeswoman , added : ' we know from work previously undertaken that eczema is more common in hard water areas and that a further study showed no benefit of using water softeners			1
' what is important for children with eczema is to use emollients on a regular basis to wash , moisturise and protect their skin			0
' also known as atopic eczema , it is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin			2
atopic is the term used to describe conditions such as asthma , eczema , seasonal rhinitis and hayfever - which often have a genetic basis			0
eczema is the term used to describe the changes in the upper layer of skin			0
they can include redness , blistering , oozing , crusting , scaling , thickening and sometimes pigmentation			0
the skin condition affects both men and women and is commonly diagnosed in the first weeks or months of life			2
ms @entity249 , from @entity261 - an area of hard water - said she saw a difference in her 10 - month - old daughter 's eczema in just four weeks , after installing a water softener , pictured it is most common in children , affecting at least 10 per cent of infants at some stage			1
eczema often disappears in childhood , but it can carry into adult life			0
in rare cases it can develop for the first time in adulthood			0
the causes of eczema are still not fully understood			0
the condition tends to run in families , with genetic make - up thought to play a part			0
the main symptom is an itching sensation			0
scratching to relive an itch may be the cause for many of the changes seen on the skin			0
it can be so severe it interrupts a sufferer 's sleep			0
the condition can affect all areas of the body , including the face			2
most commonly sufferers find the bends of their elbows and knees , the area around their wrists and neck , are affected			0
a sufferers skin will be red and dry and scratch marks and bleeding are common			0
during a flare up it is common to see small water blisters on the hands and feet , or the affected areas become moist and weepy			0
a number of factors can trigger a flare up , including heat , dust and contact with irritants including soaps and detergents			1
having a cold , bacterial and viral infections , stress and dry skin can also result in a flare up			0

new study of demand for skincare treatments reveals link between hard water and the symptoms of eczema
the condition causes red , itchy , inflamed , cracked and sore skin and can be exacerbated by a number of factors , including stress , detergents , soaps and perfumes as well as diet and food
survey found the demand for eczema products was in @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 - all areas with hard water
lowest sales were found to be in @entity73 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity74 – all areas of soft water
@entity84 choices says water hardness can be a trigger for eczema as the excess minerals prevent *foaming* products from working *properly* , leading to increased usage which strips skin of natural oils
new online tool provides postcode *breakdown* of water hardness in your area and how it affects your skin
