by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 04:19 est , 8 december 2012 @entity1 is believed to be secretly preparing a new version of its @entity4 handset that uses a radical ' bendable ' screen that is virtually unbreakable			1
codenamed ' @entity6 ' after mobile division chief @entity7 , development of the new @entity10 could be released as early as april , according to analysts and tech blogs			0
experts believe that as smartphones increasingly look alike , an unbreakable screen could be a big selling point for the @entity4 , which is battling @entity17 to lead the $ 200 billion plus smartphone market			1
regular led displays are usually made on a glass surface , but substituting that for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight			0
one possible mass - production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing			0
the @entity10 is also expected to have bigger and better display , powerful quad - core processing power and a 13 - megapixel camera , with picture density improving to 441 pixels per inch ( ppi ) , a big improvement from the @entity44 's 306 ppi and better than the @entity46 's 326 ppi			1
' looking to the first half of 2013 , we see evidence of @entity1 likely accelerating the release of the @entity10 - compared with may ( this year ) for the @entity44 , ' said @entity52 analyst @entity51			1
' we believe preparations for volume manufacturing of unbreakable plastic substrate displays continue			0
' all in all , we could see a strong products push in the high - end in the first half , followed by other releases			0
' @entity1 , a major backer of organic light - emitting diode ( @entity63 ) display , is a frontrunner in developing unbreakable screens , as oled panels can replace glass substrate with plastic material			0
down the road , mobile gadgets could be flexible as well as unbreakable			0
" eventually , they 'll have unbreakable and flexible displays			0
either the @entity10 or @entity73 will have unbreakable and even possibly flexible and foldable displays by 2014			0
that 's going to be a game - changer , " said @entity75 , an analyst at @entity76 in @entity77 and @entity51 are ranked as 5 - star analysts , the top ranking , by @entity81 @entity80 for their recommendations on @entity1			2
@entity20 : the breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes ( @entity63 ) , which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil durable : although being bendy is their most exciting characteristic , simply using plastic to manufacture the screens rather than glass could help make phone screens less likely to crack it would also be a game - changer for @entity1 , which has built its reputation as a ' fast follower ' of others ' technologies and designs			0
the @entity105 consumer electronics giant faces off against @entity106 again on thursday in a @entity108 courtroom for a follow - up ruling on whether it copied some of its @entity108 rival 's patents and should pay the $ 1 billion awarded to @entity106 by jurors in an august verdict			1
@entity1 wants the verdict overturned , while @entity106 wants the damages to be increased and @entity1 phones banned in the @entity108			1
since that landmark verdict , however , @entity1 shares have gained 14 percent to record highs , while @entity106 shares - dented by a maps app fiasco , tight supply of its @entity46 and ever tougher competition in the mobile market - have slipped by nearly a fifth , wiping more than $ 120 billion off its market value			1
barring any extra costs related to the @entity108 ruling , @entity1 should report a fifth straight record profit this quarter , as profits from its component business recover and more than offset thinning margins on mobile phones - squeezed by higher year - end holiday marketing campaigns			0
' @entity1 's strength extends beyond cool products , they 're also a leader in the technology behind these devices			1
the @entity44 smartphone - the next version could have a radical news ' bendy ' screen , according to rumours ' we see further upside to @entity1 's stock as success in smartphones continues and chips and display profits also rebound , ' said @entity75			1
' in smartphones , the opportunity is for @entity1 to take more share from @entity106 in the premium segment , where @entity106 is still dominant			1
' @entity52 estimates @entity1 will ship around 22.5 million of its @entity44 and @entity158 devices in the quarter to end - december , up from 20 million in july - september			2
@entity159 said in november that @entity44 sales would hit 40 million by the end of this month			2
in a worst - case scenario for @entity1 , @entity108 judge @entity162 could treble the damages payable to @entity106 , given the jury in august found @entity1 ' willfully ' infringed some @entity106 patents			2
that would be a major blow to @entity1 's fundamentals and overall investor sentiment , but it 's not the most likely scenario , ' said @entity172 , a 4 - star @entity80 analyst at @entity174 .			2

followup to @entity44 handset could have radical new screen technology
