you 've done the surprise theatre trip , followed by a slap - up dinner			1
you ’ve skated round the festive @entity4 rink more times than you care to remember			1
now , it ’s time for the big one			2
yes , we ’re in that tricky what - to - get - the - person - who - has - everything territory , and it wo n’t come cheap			2
but your star will blaze brighter than the one atop the tree in @entity14 if you sign up for a 20 - minute helicopter flight above @entity17			1
this latest tourist attraction makes the viewing gallery at @entity21 look tame			2
seeing the sights at a new height : the tour showcases @entity17 landmarks such as @entity26 the @entity27 as you 've never seen it before : @entity30 can be seen in all its @entity32 glory take - off is from @entity33 , near @entity34			1
within seconds , you ’re 1,500 ft above the @entity27 heading @entity37			1
there were seven of us on board ( including the articulate pilot , who pointed out various landmarks ) and we were all given headphones with microphones in case we wanted to ask questions or proffer an opinion			2
in fact , we were all rendered speechless - except for one man who could n’t help blurting : ‘ look , that ’s my house and there ’s the school where i drop off my kids every morning			0
’ what a show ! dome from home : the former @entity57 ( now the @entity59 concert venue ) , as seen from high above i was struck by how orderly it all looks - the neat and tidy squares , the pristine parks , the seemingly free - flowing traffic			0
@entity65 ? massive , and i ’d never quite appreciated how huge is its garden			1
the @entity68 ? sublime when reflected in the river on a cloudless day			0
wheels within wheels : a dramatic from - above snapshot of the @entity72 in its slot on the @entity74 and if you want to get a sense of the development going on at the @entity79 , then there ’s no better way than this			0
we went to @entity83 , then followed the river to the @entity85 at @entity86 before heading back			0
watch out for that huge landmark : the height of the shard is even clearer from a helicopter window say hello to the queen : the size of @entity65 - and its gardens - is clearly visible from a helicopter not bad for a back garden in central @entity17 : the grounds behind @entity65 , as seen from above @entity97 and seek : an aerial glimpse of the @entity99 , with @entity100 spreading out in the background there are three choices : @entity104 ( £ 150 ) gives you 12 minutes in the air ; sights ( £ 200 ) pays for 20 minutes and @entity108 ( £ 1,500 ) gets you exclusive use of the chopper so you can invite along five friends			1
towers of power : a helicopter - pilot 's - eye view of @entity83 , in @entity17 's @entity117 district out of time : @entity26 stands out as an oasis of history amid the modern buildings of the @entity122 a superb snapshot : the twists and turns of the @entity27 are clearly visible above @entity33 ‘ how was it ? ’ asked the man who had checked us in			1
i told him it was ‘ emotional ’ , that it had made me proud			0
and in some strange way , for 20 minutes , it made me feel i owned the greatest city in the world			0
