@entity6 ( @entity7 ) the question crowding in on @entity2 as he lost further ground in the world championship battle is whether he has any card to play other than his sheer , natural genius as a driver			1
his voice was thin and meek after he lost the @entity17 @entity16 to @entity1 team - mate @entity0 , the calculating @entity18 who is threatening to win the title by small margins of @entity23 precision			1
video mercedes reassert dominance in @entity17 @entity26 moment : championship leader @entity0 celebrates his third victory of the season in @entity17 the winner : @entity0 ( centre ) celebrates his victory with @entity2 2nd and @entity3 3rd @entity26 : @entity0 ( right ) and third placed @entity4 ' driver @entity3 celebrate jubilant : the @entity1 driver shares his champagne moment with the fans in @entity17 close : @entity1 driver @entity0 ( left ) and @entity2 battle it out for top spot in @entity17 @entity0 ( @entity1 ) - 165 @entity2 ( @entity1 ) - 136 @entity40 ( @entity41 ) - 81 @entity6 ( @entity7 ) - 79 @entity42 ( @entity43 ) - 61 @entity2 had driven beautifully here at the @entity45 in the rolling hills of green countryside , threading his car through the pack from ninth on the starting grid to zoom into fourth place on the first lap alone , en route to a second - place finish behind @entity0			1
but it is when cool calculation is needed that @entity2 is lacking against the cerebral , icy @entity0			1
for example , in qualifying on saturday , @entity2 spun — ‘ maybe i pushed the brake pedal too hard , ’ he said — and had one lap wiped because he ran off the track at @entity62			2
@entity0 was inch - perfect , so much so that the stewards spent half an hour studying an image that suggested he , too , had put all four wheels off the tarmac at the same corner			1
they gave him the benefit of the doubt			0
round the bend : pole - sitter @entity5 led the pack into turn 1 but ultimately finished in fourth so @entity0 started from third with the @entity4 cars of @entity5 and @entity3 surprisingly starting on the front row			1
@entity0 said he had been slowed a fraction by @entity2 ’s excursion off the asphalt			1
the marginally superior pace of @entity0 ’s @entity1 allowed him to force his way into the lead in the 15th of the 71 laps			2
the win gives him a 29 - point lead going into @entity2 ’s home race at @entity89 on sunday week			1
bizarrely , @entity0 was asked afterwards whether , if he won the title , he would grow a moustache to resemble that of his father @entity94 , the 1982 champion			2
the similarities are growing : @entity94 was a pugnacious character and @entity0 , for all his blond looks that won him the moniker ‘ @entity98 ’ , as in @entity99 , is showing a hard - edged pursuit of perfection that is not so obvious in his rival			2
costly : @entity2 lost almost two seconds to team - mate @entity0 during the two round of pit - stops flying : @entity2 get off to a stunning start at the @entity45 in @entity17 out : @entity107 was forced to retire from the race in @entity109 , @entity17 this weekend had echoes of the last race in @entity112			1
@entity2 erred in qualifying , surrendering pole to @entity0			1
that allowed the @entity18 to nurse the technical glitches that blighted both @entity1 from the front while @entity2 pushed his car until it retired hurt			2
the @entity120 driver was hindered by two slow pit stops yesterday but , again , his own minute error was a factor			1
he admitted he went ‘ a bit long ’ — fractionally beyond the ideal pit - box stopping place — on his first visit to the pits			1
a problem with a cracked wheel rim delayed him in the second stop			0
it cost him 1.9sec compared to @entity0			2
that was almost exactly the margin by which the pair were separated at the end			0
‘ valuable , but it would not have put me first , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ there is not much more i can do			0
i just need to execute it			0
’ so close : @entity2 pushed team - mate @entity0 right to the chequered flag but came up short in @entity17 talent : @entity2 battled well to come from ninth position to earn a second spot finish peace : @entity2 finished second in @entity17 it was noticeable that @entity1 were not as dominant as in the past			1
@entity148 said there would be a meeting at the factory in @entity152 this week to analyse how to re-establish their hegemony			0
the fast @entity89 layout should suit their super-powerful engine			0
@entity158 , @entity1 ’ executive director , has another job : trying to get the garage ’s two sides working collaboratively			0
‘ the playing field must be kept equal , ’ he said			0
‘ on saturday , the atmosphere was n’t like in the races before			0
we see it ’s getting very competitive			0
‘ we need the knowledge of the whole group , not only the drivers but the engineers on both sides of the garage			0
it ’s not about winning the next couple of races but staying competitive in the next couple of years			0
’ @entity4 , a team who deserve some respite , took third and fourth through @entity3 and @entity5			1
@entity41 had the indignity on their own track of only one finisher from their team and their subsidiary @entity184			0
@entity185 , @entity41 ’s team chief , said of engine suppliers @entity186 : ‘ reliability is unacceptable , performance is unacceptable			0
there needs to be change at @entity186			0

@entity0 claimed his third win of the year and is 29 points clear of @entity194
@entity2 lost time to @entity0 following slow pit - stops during race
@entity3 completed *podium* for @entity4 following *impressive* drive
