@entity1 ’s drink - driving hotspots were revealed today - with a small town in @entity3 found to have the highest proportion of convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs			0
the ‘ @entity18 ’ results were published by @entity9 , which analysed 11million car insurance quotes from the last 12 months to determine which postcode areas had the highest and lowest proportion of motorists with drink or drug - drive offences listed on their policies			1
@entity19 emerged at the top of the table - an area in mid-wales where the conviction rate was 1.98 offences per 1,000 drivers			1
worst place : @entity19 ( pictured ) emerged at the top of the table - an area in mid-wales where the conviction rate was 1.98 offences per 1,000 drivers the second - worst area was @entity31 ( 1.85 offences per 1,000 drivers ) , followed by @entity33 ( 1.81 ) , @entity34 ( 1.76 ) and @entity35 ( 1.72 )			1
the rest of the worst - offending top ten was @entity38 ( 1.71 ) , @entity39 in @entity40 ( 1.70 ) , @entity43 ( 1.70 ) , @entity41 ( 1.69 ) and @entity42 ( 1.67 )			1
by contrast , @entity44 are least likely to have drink or drug - driving convictions per head of population			0
@entity51 postcodes dominated the least - convicted table , with the @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity54 ) and @entity55 ( @entity57 ) codes taking up the first three positions			1
the @entity51 e area had a rate of just 0.76 offences per 1,000 drivers			1
other than @entity51 and @entity66 areas , the postcode districts with the lowest proportion of offenders included @entity67 ( 0.81 per 1,000 drivers ) , @entity68 ( 0.90 ) , @entity69 ( 1.04 ) and @entity70 ( 1.05 )			1
drink - drivers face a driving ban of at least 12 months , a fine of up to £ 5,000 , and in some cases , a prison sentence of up to six months			2
yet the report says more convictions are appearing on insurance quotes with each offence adding up £ 350 to an annual car insurance premium when the driver does get his or her licence back			1
the @entity9 report says : ‘ the rate in the rural @entity87 postcode is more than double the rate among motorists living in some @entity66 postcodes			1
‘ another drink - driving hotspot : the second - worst area was @entity31 ( 1.85 offences per 1,000 drivers ) but it also notes : ‘ the @entity40 postcodes of @entity35 ( iv ) , @entity39 ( @entity100 ) , @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity94 ( @entity95 ) and @entity96 ( @entity97 ) also feature in the top 20 , as do @entity87 hotspots @entity34 ( @entity106 ) , @entity38 ( @entity104 ) and @entity105 ( @entity103 )			1
’ the report says : ‘ drivers in @entity40 – including @entity110 drivers crossing the border - should be aware that the legal limit for alcohol in @entity40 is being reduced on december 5 , 2014			2
’ * the figure gives the drink or drug - drive conviction rate per 1,000 drivers in area the current limit is 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood ; it will fall to 50mg			1
this effectively means that one drink could put someone over the limit			0
the report also points out : ‘ looking at postcodes with relatively few convictions for drink and drug - driving , there is a proliferation of locations – 10 out of 20 – that are within the @entity133 and on the periphery of central @entity51			0
this might be because the area benefits from good public transport			0
’ a further breakdown of car insurance convictions found motorists aged 20 to 24 are the most likely to have a drink and drug conviction on their licence , at a rate of 2.5 per 1000 drivers			1
this compares to 0.7 per 1,000 for drivers aged 17 to 19 years old , some of whom are only just old enough to drink legally and learn to drive			2
male motorists are more than twice as likely to offend as women , with conviction rates at 1.7 per 1,000 male drivers , compared to 0.7 per 1,000 female counterparts			1
@entity156 , car insurance expert at @entity9 , sought to answer why offending rates were higher in some areas than others			1
capital roads : @entity44 are least likely to have drink or drug - driving convictions per head of population he said : ‘ there are serious consequences for those caught breaking the drink and drug - driving laws			0
all right - minded people understand that drink or drug - driving is wrong			0
‘ in a rural location such as @entity19 it could be the lack of public transport and the misguided belief they wo n’t get caught			2
or maybe motorists are driving the morning after the night before , when they still have excess alcohol in their system			0
‘ whatever the circumstances , the fact remains that driving while over the limit is always illegal - there is simply no excuse			0
’ mr @entity156 noted : ‘ even after a ban is served , a conviction will see insurance premiums shoot up by an average £ 350 – which is more than the cost some people ’ s policies in the first place			2
’ he added : ‘ with five @entity40 postcodes featuring in our top 20 it will be interesting to see what effect the new , lower drink - drive limit will have			2
many drivers are already being caught and convicted for drink and drug - driving , and many more could get caught out by the change in the law			0
’ @entity205 , chief examiner at the @entity206 , said : ‘ it ’s nearly 50 years since breathalysers were introduced yet incredibly there are still people drink - driving and putting lives at risk			0
‘ motorists have to face the consequences of their actions			0
the message is really simple			0
if you are driving , do n’t drink at all			0
if you are drinking , do n’t drive at all			0
’ in 2013 , @entity98 ( @entity99 ) topped the chart of over the limit drivers with a rate of 1.5 per 1000 drivers .			2
