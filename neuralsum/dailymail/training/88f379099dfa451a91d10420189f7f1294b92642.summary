it claims to be searching for ‘ the next singing superstar ’			1
but as viewers tuned in to watch @entity4 on saturday , many were left thinking the programme was more interested in advertising			0
just 15 minutes 22 seconds were devoted to singing , during the 1 hour 25 minute programme			1
the remaining 48 minutes was made up of chatter between judges , video clips of contestants and host @entity25 offering support backstage			0
and it amounted to a small amount of actual singing being screened during what is @entity33 ’s flagship entertainment show			1
among the commercials were several @entity36 adverts , featuring judge @entity37 , 31 , and after the programme had ended there was a @entity40 one featuring @entity41 , 39			2
taking to @entity43 , one viewer wrote : ‘ the x factor has more tv adverts than actual auditions what a joke , ’ while another noted : ‘ the worst thing about x factor is the 6,000,000 advert breaks			1
’ ‘ look forward to seeing the next 3 auditions within the next 45 minutes ... # xfactor , ’ one quipped sarcastically			1
some suggested the programme be renamed ‘ @entity57 ’			1
and others admitted deliberately missing the programme when it was broadcast at 8pm , so they could watch it on catch up later on and fast forward through the adverts			2
‘ watching x factor on catch up , adverts destroy the programme , ’ one wrote , while another posted : ‘ note to self : x factor must only ever be watched on catch up ! [ fast forward through ] adverts , judges , all the chit chat c * * * and boom a tidy 30min show			1
’ however , while catch up services on televisions allow viewers to skip past advertisements , anyone trying to watch the first episode of series 11 on @entity79 would have been forced to watch the commercials			2
online , the programme was divided into five sections , with viewers unable to move from one to the next without sitting through three or four adverts			0
the lack of viewer support will come as a blow for @entity33 bosses , who had hoped to win over fans with the latest instalment of @entity4 the lack of viewer support will come as a blow for @entity33 bosses , who had hoped to win over fans with the latest instalment of @entity4			0
next week the programme will go head to head with @entity101 , when the celebrity dance contest begins on @entity103			0
on @entity43 viewers discussed which one they would choose to watch , with one writing : ‘ watch @entity101 , record x factor , then you can fast forward all of the adverts			0
’ it is not the first time @entity33 has been hit with accusations of too many commercial breaks in its programmes			1
the @entity4 , @entity116 ’s @entity115 , and period drama @entity117 have all faced similar claims in the past			0
earlier this year viewers complained that @entity116 ’s @entity115 , which is @entity123 ’s other talent show , was cutting to an advert break after almost every performance			0
last night a spokesman for the programme said : ‘ the number of minutes of advertising shown in @entity4 was no more than is usual in a programme of its length and was fully compliant with allowances stipulated in the @entity134 on the scheduling of tv advertising			2

just 15 minutes 22 seconds were devoted to singing on the @entity33 programme
adverts were given a larger chunk of time , taking up 21 minutes 35 seconds
some suggested the programme should be renamed ‘ @entity57 ’
others watched show on catch *-* up so they could skip through the adverts
