at half - time , everything pointed to another humiliating @entity3 defeat in @entity4			1
such was the control @entity7 had been able to exert on @entity8 in an utterly one - sided first half punctuated only by a single piece of individual brilliance by fly - half @entity12 , it was impossible to see a way back into the contest for the @entity16			1
outmuscled at the breakdown , bullied in the scrum and laboured in the line - out , @entity8 were in danger of going down every bit as tamely as @entity3 had a month ago			2
@entity8 fly half @entity12 ghosts past @entity7 full - back @entity23 on his way to fine individual score at the @entity27 the @entity3 no 10 's solo - try was the only score that the @entity31 outfit managed to register in the first - half by the end , remarkably , the three - time champions @entity7 were hanging on for dear life as wave after wave of @entity8 attack threatened to deliver one of the great @entity41 comebacks			1
they fell short , but there was pride to be taken in this			0
driven on by their pocket general @entity46 , @entity8 somehow came within a whisker of finding a way into the last four			1
had it not been for a penalty conceded by replacement @entity51 with seconds on the clock , they may well have won			0
‘ there ’s a lot of disappointment , ’ said @entity8 head coach @entity55			2
‘ certainly in the second half we are a lot better than the first			0
we ’re so disappointed because we are a lot better than we showed today , especially in the first half			0
@entity46 is congratulated by @entity8 substitutes @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 following his touchdown @entity23 is taken out in the air by @entity68 leading to the full - back being dispatched to the sin - bin for 10 minutes ‘ but it does n’t dent our belief in what we ’re doing			1
we lost the game in the first half but i believe that will make us stronger			0
i ’m proud of the boys , but we ’ll be even more gutted when we watch the video			0
it comes down to small margins and i thought the penalty at the end was a dead - set penalty to us			2
’ he would say that , of course			0
but his sentiment was correct and @entity46 insisted his team will retain their determination to attack for the remainder of the @entity90 season			2
fly - half @entity46 was exceptional			1
rarely making a false move , dragging his side along with some intelligent kicking , brave distribution and a sharp eye for the gap			0
his first - half try was a masterpiece of fly - half play as he took the ball flat to line , flashed a dummy and scooted through a non-existent gap before rounding full - back @entity23 to score			2
@entity8 lock @entity107 crashes over for his side 's second try following another dazzling break from @entity46 but despite his 21st - minute moment of brilliance , it looked for all the world as if @entity7 would repeat @entity117 ’s @entity116 strangulation of @entity3 as @entity8 ’s discipline failed under the pressure of @entity7 ’s superior set - piece and domination at the breakdown			1
that impression was compounded when @entity8 full - back @entity68 , one of four visiting players who only a month ago suffered @entity116 heartache on the same @entity27 pitch , spent 10 minutes in the sin - bin for a reckless aerial challenge on @entity23			2
referee @entity130 showed @entity68 a yellow card , despite the shameful pleas by three @entity7 players for him to be shown red , and @entity7 centre @entity134 kicked two more penalties in his absence to send his side in 15 - 5 up at half - time and seemingly in complete control			1
@entity134 was in imperious kicking form as the @entity7 centre fired over six penalties but @entity8 showed their mettle with a wonderful second - half revival			1
despite their disappointment at failing to progress , @entity8 should take enormous confidence in knowing that with more precision they could , should even , have won this game			0
their determination to put width on the ball and play at high tempo must be applauded , even if it has n’t yet brought the silverware the huge investment in their squad will demand sooner rather than later			0
@entity7 scrum half @entity157 fires out a pass during a frantic opening quarter in @entity4 the 22 - year - old @entity12 was at the heart of everything they did while @entity68 proved razor - sharp every time he received the ball			1
with 47 minutes gone , and @entity7 winger @entity165 off the field with a concussion sustained in a tackle from @entity169 , @entity46 produced his second moment of magic			1
this time he stepped on the inside of @entity173 , before turning on the after - burners and feeding inside to his second - row captain @entity107 to crash over			1
another @entity134 penalty — his sixth of the afternoon — made it 18 - 12 to @entity7 but @entity8 had the bit between their teeth			1
@entity68 fells the full force of @entity182 's tackle as @entity169 ( left ) moves in to support his team - mate @entity8 flanker @entity185 eyes up @entity134 in defence as @entity187 ( right ) looks to make the hit @entity68 made a scintillating break from deep within his half before feeding the ball to @entity46 who in turn flipped a pass to @entity195			1
agonisingly , with the line beckoning , the winger dropped the ball and the chance was lost			0
it proved a critical moment in an absorbing game			0
@entity46 kicked another penalty to drag the score back to 18 - 15 with six minutes left but the visitors were unable to land the killer blow as @entity51 was harshly penalised by @entity130 with seconds on the clock			1
ultimately the first half had cost @entity46 ’s men a crack at @entity212 or @entity213 in the semi-final			2
‘ it was a pretty stressful last 15 minutes , ’ @entity7 director of rugby @entity215 said			2
‘ i was pretty relaxed before that but they came back really strong			0
@entity68 is dangerous from broken field and he cut us up a couple of times			0
they had threats all over the field			0
i was pretty relieved by the end			0
’ @entity7 flanker @entity228 rises high to claim a lineout as the @entity8 pack get ready to defend another attack @entity8 's players stand dejected on the @entity27 pitch at the final whistle following their 18 - 15 defeat			1

@entity12 *scythed* through the @entity7 defence for *sublime* try in the first half
five penalties from @entity134 gave @entity7 a 15 - 5 half - time lead
@entity107 crashed over for @entity8 's second try following another dazzling @entity46 break
@entity134 's sixth penalty proved *crucial* as @entity7 held on for a hard - fought *victory*
