by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s magnetic field , which protects the planet from cosmic radiation , has grown weaker over the past six months			1
data collected by the @entity7 ’s swarm satellites has indicated weak spots in the magnetic field			1
the first set of high - resolution images generated from the constellation reveals dramatic declines over the @entity14			1
the @entity2 's magnetic field , which protects the planet from solar radiation , has grown weaker over the past six months , according to satellite data			1
this map shows the filed from january to june			0
shades of red represent areas of strengthening , while blues show areas of weakening over the 6 - month period @entity26 : swarm is a constellation of thee identical satellites , measuring the @entity2 's magnetic field			1
launched : november 2013 orbit : two satellites orbit side - by - side , initially at an altitude of 285miles ( 460km ) moving to 186miles ( 300km ) while the third one operates at 330miles ( 530km )			0
mission life : four years satellites : each satellite weighs 1,043lbs ( 473kg ) at launch and is 29ft ( 9m ) long , 4ft ( 1.5m ) wide and 2ft ( 85cm ) high			0
instruments : vector field magnetometer , electric field instrument , accelerometer , gps receiver , startrackers and laser retroreflector mission control : @entity7 's @entity47 ( @entity48 ) in @entity49 , @entity50			2
however , the field has strengthened in other areas since january , including over the southern @entity53			2
scientists are unsure why the magnetic field is weakening , but one reason could be that the magnetic poles are preparing to flip , @entity55 mission manager @entity54 told @entity60			1
the latest measurements , made by magnetometers on board the three swarm satellites confirm the movement of magnetic @entity66 towards @entity67			1
‘ such a flip is not instantaneous , it would take many hundreds if not a few thousand years			0
' they have happened many times in the past , ’ he said			0
@entity55 ( pictured ) is @entity7 's first @entity2 observation constellation of satellites			2
two satellites orbit almost side - by - side at the same altitude - initially at about 460km - while the third satellite is in a higher orbit of 530km changes in the strength of the @entity2 ’s magnetic field are normal , but satellites have shown that it is weakening more rapidly than in the past			1
scientists have previously estimated that the @entity2 ’s magnetic field is weakening at five per cent every century , but now they believe it could be diminishing 10 times as fast			1
this means that the flip could occur sooner than the 2,000 years already predicted , according to experts who presented their findings at the @entity91 in @entity92			0
scientists are not sure why the magnetic field is weakening , but one reason could be that the magnetic poles are about to flip			2
the magnetic field and electric currents near @entity2 ( pictured ) generate complex forces , but exactly how it is generated and why it changes is not yet fully understood @entity7 ’s satellites pick up signals from the magnetic field as well as other sources , which could help scientists solve the mystery of why the planet ’s magnetic field behaves as it does			1
‘ over the coming months , scientists will analyse the data to unravel the magnetic contributions from other sources , namely the mantle , crust , oceans , ionosphere and magnetosphere , ’ @entity7 said			0
‘ this will provide new insight into many natural processes , from those occurring deep inside our planet to space weather triggered by solar activity			0
in turn , this information will yield a better understanding of why the magnetic field is weakening			0
’ there is no evidence to suggest that a weakened magnetic field will mark the end of life on @entity2 as we know it			2
during previous flips , there are no records of mass extinctions or evidence of radiation damage			0
but as with the threat of space weather , scientists think that power grids and modern communication systems would be most at risk			0
this is a snapshot of the main magnetic field at @entity2 's surface as of june 2014 , based on @entity55 data			1
the measurements are dominated by the magnetic contribution from @entity2 's core ( about 95 % ) while the contributions from other sources ( the mantle , crust , oceans , ionosphere and magnetosphere ) make up the rest			2
@entity163 represents areas where the magnetic field is stronger , while blues show areas where it is weaker			0

@entity170 was collected by the @entity7 's @entity55 satellites
first data set reveals dramatic declines over the @entity14 , but a strengthening of the @entity2 's magnetic field over the southern @entity53
changes could be *due* to the magnetic poles getting ready to ' flip '
latest measurements confirm movement of magnetic @entity66 towards @entity67
scientists previously estimated the @entity2 ’s magnetic field is weakening at five per cent every century and now think it could be 10 times as fast
