@entity1 's hopes of winning the @entity2 is over after being comfortably beaten by @entity3 in @entity4 - who themselves moved to the top of the @entity8 standings and put themselves in pole position			1
@entity11 scored the only try of the game and @entity14 kicked four penalties and a conversion as the @entity17 dominated @entity19 's side for most of the game			1
but the star was scrum half @entity22 who terrorised his opponents with his clever kicking and quick thinking passing			1
@entity22 ( cetre ) was the star for @entity3 during their win over @entity1 in the @entity8 clash @entity3 @entity29 – 6.5 made a couple of important tackles when @entity1 threatened out wide , but not a major presence in attack			1
@entity34 – 6 @entity3 did n’t play expansively so he was quite peripheral			1
one glaring fumble but largely tidy in defence @entity37 – 6 another who did n’t have much of an opportunity to run with the ball but he tackled and competed at rucks with gusto			2
@entity11 – 8 he had already shown great courage and commitment over the ball , before his brilliant try settled the match			1
@entity11 ( left ) collects the high ball to score @entity3 's only try in their victory over @entity1 @entity49 – 7 soon set his stall out with swerving runs			1
superb in the air ; with one brilliant leaping catch above several opponents			2
@entity14 – 7.5 eventually withdrew injured but pulled the strings with typical authority and quick off the line in defence			1
@entity22 – 9 enhanced reputation as one of the world ’s best scrum halves			1
his kicking tormented @entity1 and one fine break early in the second half			1
@entity22 's kicking and passing game troubled the @entity67 throughout as he showed why he 's rated so highly @entity68 – 6.5 he was asked to once again fill @entity70 ’s berth at loosehead prop and he did not disappoint as a physical deputy			1
@entity73 – 9 the @entity75 hooker is a stalwart of this team and was superb			1
efficient at lineout , nearly scored early on and a ruck colossus			1
@entity80 – 7 @entity1 would have hoped to gain an advantage in the scrum , but the @entity84 tighthead ensured that did n’t happen			1
@entity86 – 6.5 one crucial lineout steal in the first half			0
eclipsed by his second - row partner around the field but a solid effort			2
@entity93 – 8 another giant display by the veteran @entity95			0
he kept carrying hard throughout and was a towering figurehead			0
@entity14 kicked four penalties and a conversion to help the @entity101 seal their place at the top of table @entity105 – 7 the @entity107 flanker offered his side the abrasive , unglamourous work they needed to gain the edge up front			1
@entity113 – 7 impressive over the ball despite conceding early penalty			0
not a prominent ball - carrier , but played his part in momentous win			2
@entity120 – 6 went off before the half - hour and seemed to be concussed after a strong drive out of defence			2
replacements @entity126 6 , @entity127 6 , @entity128 6.5 , i @entity129 6 , @entity130 6.5 , i madigan 5 , @entity131 6			0
@entity1 @entity132 – 7 composed under high ball , showed intent to run from deep , good escape from behind own line but beaten to kick for @entity11 try			1
@entity137 – 5 missed early high kicks and struggled in the air			0
made one blistering run from deep but spoiled it with wild off - load			2
@entity142 – 6 after two glorious performances , this was n't his day			0
no chances to cut loose but he kept looking for work			0
@entity148 – 6.5 prevented best from scoring a try amid early siege and often carried strongly in midfield to give his side momentum			2
@entity154 – 7 energetic and committed , couple of good kick - and - chase efforts and late on he threatened the @entity101 defence , to no avail			2
@entity154 ( right ) was @entity1 's best performer in a disappointing performance in @entity4 @entity159 – 6 conceded turnover in the first minute and blew hot and cold from then on			1
some nice touches but some lapses too			0
@entity163 – 6 looked bright and dangerous for a spell during the first half but could n’t match @entity22 ’s impact with testing box - kicks			1
@entity168 – 6.5 heavily involved			0
forceful hits , a few effective carries and strong over the ball , to continue his fine @entity172 form			0
@entity174 – 6 his lineout throwing went awry a couple of times in the first half but he was full of intensity around the field			0
@entity159 ( left ) kicked three penalties for the away side but he struggled with lapses in concentration @entity184 – 6 one barnstorming charge late on , but by and large the @entity187 prop was occupied with desperate fire - fighting up front			1
@entity189 – 7 prominent with early carries , aggressive in defence and showed staggering work - rate , especially during the first half			2
@entity192 – 5.5 kept trying in vain to pressurise the @entity101 kickers			0
not among the leading carriers and quieter than in previous games			0
@entity197 – 6 strong defensive presence early on and he made the @entity101 fight for every yard , but a limited breakdown presence			0
@entity189 ( centre ) also gave a solid performance and showed terrific tenacity and fight @entity206 – 6.5 as with earlier matches , he grew into it as time went on , after a slow start			0
was at full throttle in the final quarter			0
@entity213 – 6 not his best game			0
conceded penalty in first minute , a fumble later and could n’t impose order amid hasty chaos			0
replacements @entity220 6.5 , @entity221 7 , @entity222 6.5 , @entity223 6 , @entity224 7 , @entity225 6 .			0
