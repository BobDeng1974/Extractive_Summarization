defender @entity0 has admitted @entity1 got exactly what they deserved from their derby trip to @entity4 - nothing			1
the 25 - year - old @entity6 full - back played the full 90 minutes of sunday 's 1 - 0 @entity8 defeat at the @entity9 despite suffering a suspected tear in his calf muscle during the warm - up , but was unable to prevent the @entity4 running out winners as the @entity14 slipped to a record fifth successive defeat in the fixture			1
@entity1 created little of note on another poor day for @entity20 's men , and @entity0 was pulling no punches as he assessed the fall - out			1
@entity0 ( left ) has admitted that @entity1 's performance in their @entity23 against @entity4 was n't good enough and they got exactly what they deserved - nothing the @entity6 full - back played the full 90 minutes despite a suspected calf muscle tear @entity0 tries to get across and stop a cross from @entity4 's @entity29 at the @entity9 he told @entity30 : ' it was not good enough			1
the first half was really poor , we were too negative , so it was not good enough			0
the second half was much better , but it still was n't good enough			0
' i would n't say we did n't give everything			0
what i can say is we were not good enough and everybody saw that @entity4 were better , especially in the first half			2
' if you are not good enough , then most of the time , you lose			0
' @entity1 were simply not at the races as a @entity4 side motivated by new head coach @entity43 dominated from the off , although they looked like making it to half - time unharmed before @entity47 smashed home a stoppage - time volley which proved to be the tangible difference between the teams			1
@entity0 said : ' a goal in the last minute of the first half , it 's always hard to concede it because you go into the dressing room with a bad feeling			0
if you go in at 0 - 0 , you can be positive in the dressing room , but if you concede a goal in the 47th minute , then it 's hard			2
@entity47 scored the winning goal - a spectacular volley - on the stroke of half - time @entity47 's goal proved to be ample reward for @entity4 's dominance in the @entity23 the result moves @entity4 three points clear of the @entity8 relegation zone april 13 @entity71 ( a ) april 19 @entity72 ( @entity73 ) april 25 @entity74 ( @entity73 ) may 2 @entity75 ( a ) may 9 @entity76 ( @entity73 ) may 16 @entity77 ( a ) may 24 @entity78 ( @entity73 ) ' but they deserved to score in the first half because they had maybe 20 free - kicks and they were better than us , then normally you score a goal			1
like i said , it was not good enough			0
' defeat was greeted with fury by frustrated fans who have now seen @entity4 take 17 of the 21 points on offer in the last seven derby encounters			2
indeed , the @entity4 have won just 17 of their last 75 league games , five of them against their neighbours , a statistic which provides a damning indictment of @entity1 's lack of progress on the field			1
the @entity14 last week reported profits of Â£ 18.7million at a time when its recruitment policy has once again come under close scrutiny			0
@entity20 went into sunday 's game with only one recognised central defender and right - back @entity0 having to play in the middle with midfielders @entity110 and @entity112 operating as full - backs , and he was also without a proven @entity8 striker in the 18			1
@entity1 manager @entity20 had to cope with a weakened defence following injuries @entity0 gets stuck into a challenge with @entity4 's @entity29 during the derby match that selection crisis was due in part to suspensions for @entity122 and @entity123 and injuries to @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , as well as midfielders @entity128 , @entity130 and @entity131 , a casualty list which has served to expose the lack of depth in a squad assembled on a budget and made up largely of players sold a move to @entity139 as a stepping stone to bigger things			1
owner @entity143 's tight financial constraints mean where the @entity14 were once able to compete for big names - it was they who sparked the bidding war which ultimately led to @entity149 's move to @entity150 from @entity151 in 2004 - they are now unwilling to do so even with clubs of a similar or lesser stature , and as a result , less able to do so on the pitch			0
@entity1 have made no secret of their view that the domestic cup competitions are unimportant , and @entity160 qualification very nearly ended in disaster during the 2012 - 13 campaign			2
mid-table @entity8 status and financial self - sufficiency remain the stated dual focus and as a result , disenchantment on the terraces has reached epidemic levels			0
it is against that backdrop that @entity20 is attempting to prove he is the man to replace @entity172 at the helm , but a run of two wins from 13 games represents a less than impressive audition despite the mitigating factors .			0

@entity4 beat a *lacklustre* @entity1 1 - 0 in @entity23
@entity0 played the full 90 minutes despite suspected calf injury
the @entity6 full - back admitted performance was n't up to *standard*
@entity4 have not taken 17 of last 21 point available in derby games
