just what is a woman to do when they 've secured a table at the hottest restaurant in the world for their 39th birthday , but do n't have anyone to take ? if you 're mobile tech entrepenuer @entity10 and the restaurant in question is @entity16 's @entity15 pop - up , the answer is to take the search to your blog			1
ms @entity10 is one of the lucky few to get a table during the usually @entity23 - based eateries five - week stint in the @entity25 capital , which ends on @entity26			1
but ms @entity10 , from @entity27 , is dateless - so she has advertised the second seat at her table - for - two			1
unsurprisingly when 6,000 scrabbled to get a reservation , ms @entity30 has been inundated with offers			1
@entity10 was among the lucky few to get a table at @entity35 's @entity15 pop - up - but does n't have a date for the sought - after meal so ms @entity10 has advertised for a fellow food enthusiast to join her for the meal , which falls on her 39th birthday writing on her blog , @entity43 , she explained : ' yes , there were 60,000 people who tried to get this reservation and i am lucky enough to have secured one for two			1
' and , sadly , i do n’t have a dining companion			0
' so i decided since i ’m single and dateless on what will be my 39th birthday that i would open up the opportunity for someone to take advantage of this crazy , once in a lifetime meal and find myself a date			1
' indeed , each sitting at the restaurant has just 44 spaces for diners , meaning seats are at a premium			2
and it seems even head chef @entity64 knows how sought - after they are : he gave ms @entity10 's hunt a boost when he tweeted out her appeal from his official @entity70 account			1
but the opportunity is not open to just anyone			0
ms @entity10 , who lists her likes as travelling , good food , ' nerding out ' on gadgets and hanging out with bald cats , among other things , has set out a strict criteria which a potential date must meet			1
ms @entity10 has been swamped with men desperate to accompany her to @entity16 , which is based in @entity23 ( pictured ) this is the first time head chef @entity64 has left his @entity83 restaurant ( pictured ) for a residency in another country writing on her blog , she stipulated eight must - haves for anyone applying - including being single , living in the @entity89 of @entity27 , and know how to use a knife and fork ' properly '			1
' knowledge of @entity25 etiquette a big plus , ' she added			2
the date will also have to be able to cover their own flight and accommodation costs			2
however , the 38 - year - old will pay for dinner and wine pairing for the meal , which is to take place in the last week of january			2
but even with the strict rules , and with flights boasting a price tag of somewhere around $ 1,000 , ms @entity10 has had so many applications she has had to extend the opening date			1
' i did n’t think that this was going to go as crazy as it has , ' she wrote in an update on january 13			0
' i am honestly humbled by this entire experience and i have n’t even gotten to the grand finale ! ' she added : ' there are so many awesome guys out there that it is going to be really difficult to pick just one			0
' the lucky winner will be selected after she meets up with three of the potential dinner dates on january 17			2
but whether or not the world will ever discover who ms @entity10 's dining companion was is unclear			1
she has left that decision up to him			0
@entity83 chef @entity64 , who won the title @entity129 with @entity16 two years in a row , has moved to @entity25 for a five week stint in @entity15 foodies across the planet have been raving about @entity16 for years - with more than one dubbing it ' the world 's best restaurant '			1
the restaurant , which is based in @entity23 , serves @entity140 food reimagined under the watchful eye of head chef @entity64			0
@entity16 's website boasts it is ' hoping to rediscover our history and shape our future ' through its food			0
diners are offered a 20 - course menu , including unusual dishes such as beef tartare and ants , radish and yeast and reindeer moss and cep mushrooms			0
a meal at the two @entity158 - starred restaurant costs around about £ 166 , with wine pairing costing an extra £ 104			2
but it is worth it , according to the restaurant critics			0
writing for the @entity164 in 2010 , @entity163 concluded : ' @entity16 is utterly and gloriously unique			0
and quite , quite brilliant			0
' the @entity15 pop - up is the first time @entity64 and his team have ventured outside @entity83			0
it opened last friday , and so far reviews trickling out suggest it will be just as successful in the east .			0
