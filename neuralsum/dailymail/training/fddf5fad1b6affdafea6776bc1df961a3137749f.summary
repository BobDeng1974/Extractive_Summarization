zoom : how everything moves by @entity2 , suggested that the @entity6 moves around the sun did you hear the one about the theoretical physicist who was pulled over for speeding on the motorway ? he explained to the policeman that , as @entity14 had shown , all motion is relative and thus , from his own point of reference , he was n’t even moving			1
so the policeman gave him a parking ticket			2
of course , simply because motion is relative — an idea that @entity22 first articulated 300 years before @entity14 — is not to say it does n’t exist			1
and @entity2 ’s zoom is an absorbing account of how motion is everywhere around us , and nothing in the universe is motionless			2
the pre-socratic philosopher @entity29 , who is said to have declared ‘ everything flows ’ , does n’t get a look - in , but the reader is treated to a breezy narrative of scientists ’ discoveries that things we once thought were static — even , it turns out , the magnetic poles — are actually in constant flux			1
everything with temperature has motion			1
until the 1960s , @entity45 tells us , physicists had thought that , if thermometers were placed sufficiently far from any stars , they could give a reading of absolute zero on the @entity52			0
but they now know that the heat of the @entity54 is spread across the cosmos — although the universe is actually getting colder ; it was twice as warm 8 billion years ago			0
@entity45 , an astronomer who has written a number of successful popular science titles , takes us on a journey in two senses			0
first is the book ’s trajectory , moving from the cosmic through to the global ( explaining phenomena such as the tectonic shifts of the continents , why @entity68 is getting taller , and why jet streams mean that a coast - to - coast flight in the @entity71 uses 20 per cent less fuel going eastwards than westwards ) , and on to life forms ( some bacteria move 100 times their body length in a second , you could outrun a mosquito but not a dragonfly , and your lymph fluids move at about a quarter of an inch a minute )			0
we then head to more mind - stretching territory again , with quantum mechanics and discussion of the current scientific consensus that ‘ particles and photons — matter and energy — apparently transmit knowledge across the entire universe instantly ’			2
the second journey is a literal one , as @entity45 travels around the world to research the information for his book and to talk to leading scientists in their respective fields			0
he makes a trip to the @entity100 to visit the @entity102 - funded observatory in @entity103 , where the night sky is dark enough to gather the light from galaxies 8 billion light - years away			0
in an era in which scientists continue to hope for a ‘ theory of everything ’ , an all - encompassing description of the universe that is profound and yet so concise it could fit as a slogan on a t - shirt , @entity45 offers us an ad hoc stand - in there ’s a trek to the equator to explore the coriolis effect and a stay in @entity120 to find out about the formation of snowflakes and the permutations of ice flows			1
our peripatetic researcher even travels to the @entity127 island of @entity128 , where he garners material for just a footnote about @entity4 , who , some 1,800 years before @entity5 , suggested that the @entity6 moves around the sun. in an era in which scientists continue to hope for a ‘ theory of everything ’ , an all - encompassing description of the universe that is profound and yet so concise it could fit as a slogan on a t - shirt , @entity45 offers us an ad hoc stand - in — albeit the same as @entity29 : ‘ stuff moves			1

just because motion is relative does **n't** mean it does **n't** exist
