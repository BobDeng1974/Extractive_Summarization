by @entity0 abandoning his pledge to act by the end of summer , president @entity3 has decided to delay any executive action on immigration until after the november congressional elections , @entity2 officials said			1
the move instantly infuriated immigration advocates while offering relief to some vulnerable @entity12 in tough @entity14 re-election contests			1
two @entity2 officials said @entity3 concluded that circumventing @entity16 through executive actions on immigration during the campaign would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass a broad overhaul			2
the president is now waiting until after the november mid-term election to make that move the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president 's decision before it was announced , said @entity3 made his decision friday as he returned to @entity36 from a @entity38 summit in @entity39			1
they said @entity3 called a few allies from @entity41 to inform them of his decision , and that the president made more calls from the @entity2 on saturday			1
the officials said @entity3 had no specific timeline to act , but that he still would take his executive steps before the end of the year			1
in a @entity49 speech on june 30 , @entity3 said he had directed homeland security secretary @entity50 and attorney general @entity51 to give him recommendations for executive action by the end of summer			1
@entity3 also pledged to ' adopt those recommendations without further delay			2
' @entity3 faced competing pressures from immigration advocacy groups that wanted prompt action and from @entity12 worried that acting now would energize @entity59 opposition against vulnerable @entity12			1
among those considered most at risk were @entity63 sens. @entity62 of @entity64 , @entity65 of @entity66 and @entity67 of @entity68			0
president @entity3 made the decision on his flight back from @entity39 friday night , where he attended a @entity38 conference			2
pictured above arriving back at the white house on friday @entity3 advisers were not convinced that any presidential action would affect the elections			2
but the officials said the discussions around timing grew more pronounced within the past few weeks			0
ultimately , the advisers drew a lesson from 1994 when @entity63 losses were blamed on votes for gun - control legislation , undermining any interest in passing future gun measures			0
@entity2 officials said aides realized that if @entity3 's immigration action was deemed responsible for @entity63 losses this year , it could hurt any attempt to pass a broad overhaul later on			0
immigration advocates blasted @entity3 and @entity14 @entity12 over the decision , saying both have shown a lack of political will			1
' we are bitterly disappointed in the president and we are bitterly disappointed in the @entity12 , ' said @entity100 , executive director of @entity101			1
' we advocates did n't make the reform promise ; we just made the mistake of believing it			0
the president and @entity14 @entity12 have chosen politics over people , the status quo over solving real problems			1
' @entity111 , managing director of @entity112 we dream , said the decision was ' another slap to the face of the @entity116 and immigrant community			0
' ' where we have demanded leadership and courage from both @entity12 and the president , we 've received nothing but broken promises and a lack of political backbone , ' she said			1
partisan fighting erupted recently over how to address the increased flow of unaccompanied minors from @entity128 at the @entity130 border with @entity131			2
the officials said the @entity2 had not envisioned such a battle when @entity3 made his pledge june 30			0
@entity3 asked for $ 3.7 billion to address the border crisis			0
the @entity59 - controlled @entity2 , however , passed a measure that only gave @entity3 a fraction of what he sought and made it easier to deport the young migrants arriving at the border , a provision opposed by @entity12 and immigration advocates			1
in the end , @entity16 adjourned without a final bill			0
the number of minors caught alone illegally crossing the @entity131 border into the @entity130 has been declining since june			1
that decrease and @entity16 ' absence from @entity36 during august has taken attention away from the border for now			0
this summer , a mass of unaccompanied minors from @entity128 crossed into the @entity130 leaving immigration authorities with the difficult task of figuring out what to do with the children			1
above , some of these young illegal immigrants in @entity161 still , the dispute over how to deal with the surge of @entity128 border crossers threatened to spill over into the larger debate over immigration and the fate of 11 million immigrants in the @entity130 who either entered illegally or overstayed their visas and have been in the @entity130 for some time			1
the @entity63 - led @entity14 last year passed a broad overhaul of immigration that boosted border security , increased visas for legal immigrants and a provided a path to citizenship for immigrants illegally in the country			2
but the @entity59 - controlled @entity2 balked at acting on any broad measure and @entity2 speaker @entity180 , @entity181 , informed @entity3 earlier this year that the @entity2 would not act in 2014			2
that led @entity3 to declare he would act on his own			0
during a news conference friday in @entity39 , @entity3 reiterated his determination to act on his own even as he avoided making a commitment on timing			0
he also spelled out ambitious objectives for his executive actions			0
@entity3 said that without legislation from @entity16 , he would take steps to increase border security , upgrade the processing of border crossers and encourage legal immigration			0
he also said he would offer immigrants who have been illegally in the @entity130 for some time a way to become legal residents , pay taxes , pay a fine and learn @entity199			2
' i want to be very clear : my intention is , in the absence of ... action by @entity16 , i 'm going to do what i can do within the legal constraints of my office , because it 's the right thing to do for the country , " he said			0
the extent of @entity3 's authority is a matter of debate among legal experts and in @entity16			0
some @entity12 say it would be best for @entity3 to let @entity16 act			1
but pro-immigrant groups called on @entity3 to stick to his end - of - summer deadline and weighed in with a strongly worded appeal to him on friday			1
' being a leader requires making difficult and courageous decisions , ' said the letter , whose signers included the @entity221 and the @entity222			0
' it is your time to lead , mr. president			0

the president pledged in june to act on immigration by the end of summer
he has since decided not to act until after the mid-term elections in november
the decision comes as a relief to @entity12 running in *highly* - contested races
but it also proves *troublesome* for immigration advocates since the @entity130 is dealing with an influx of illegal migrants
