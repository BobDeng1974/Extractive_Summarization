these fascinating pictures show the hoard of nuts collected by a squirrel who stole them from a bird table before stashing them away under the bonnet of a @entity9			1
the animal helped itself to food left out for the birds in the garden of a @entity15 property before crawling inside the engine of the car and hiding them in the air filter			1
the secret stash of nuts was only discovered when the owner of the @entity9 1.6 took her vehicle to the garage because she could n't work out why it would n't go above 40mph			1
@entity38 , who owns the garage , said he ran a complete set of tests before making the discovery			0
he said : ' it was rammed solid with nuts			0
i 've been doing this job for 18 years and i 've never seen anything like it			0
i could n't believe it '			0
he , along with colleague @entity62 , spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a supermarket carrier bag			1
mr @entity38 added : ' i ca n't be certain , it could have been a mouse , but i think it was more likely a squirrel			0
' the owner was as shocked as we were			0
she 'd been leaving nuts on a bird table in the back garden , and somebody had been helping himself to them			1
' he 'd been getting into the garage , where she parked the car , and had been climbing right inside the engine bay and squeezing himself into the air filter			1
' he kept on doing until he could n't get any more in			0
' mr @entity38 spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a carrier bag			2
he said he only made the discovery after diagnostic tests failed to find the problem the nuts had been stuffed into the air filter by the squirrel until no more could possibly fit in the pump the car was taken to @entity44 near @entity45 , in the @entity46 , after it failed to go more than 40mph mr @entity38 had initially suspected a problem with the catalytic converter but discovered the nut stash after a series of diagnostic tests failed to reveal what the problem was			1
ms @entity62 , who has worked at the firm for five years , said : ' the lady whose car it is had obviously been feeding the birds and a squirrel or a mouse had stashed them in the car			2
' it was quite fascinating			0
when we took the air filter lid off we were just gobsmacked			2
' the car 's owner declined to comment on the matter .			2
