for man 's best friend , the lure of the great outdoors can send even the stumpiest tail wagging in excitement			0
but one timid dog is so petrified of what lurks outside her kennel that she rarely ever meets other dogs and their owners			0
staff at @entity12 hope a televised appeal with @entity14 will help the agoraphobic dog , named @entity16 , find a new permanent place to live			1
@entity16 , the six - year - old @entity11 , is agoraphobic , and rarely meets other people or dogs @entity12 senior animal welfare assistant @entity20 has slowly built a rapport with the @entity11 by sitting quietly in the her kennel and feeding her			1
ms @entity20 said : ' whisper is a gentle , loving , kind - natured dog , and she is going to make the most amazing pet for someone who has the time and patience to slowly build her trust and confidence			0
' we know that she 's going to need very understanding owners but more than anything we want her to enjoy a life outside kennels like any other dog			2
whisper has had a terrible start to life and she really deserves a happy ending			0
' it is thought @entity16 had been used as a breeding bitch before being brought to @entity42 as a stray while most rescue dogs love going for walks , @entity16 will only leave her kennel once all the other dogs are in bed for the night and the staff and visitors have gone home			1
only when the grounds are deserted for the day does she feel it is safe to venture outside			0
@entity12 staff have encountered all sorts of behaviour over the years , but agoraphobic @entity16 is one of the most extreme cases they have ever faced			1
the six - year - old has been with @entity12 staff since she was found cowering underneath a bush in @entity62 in january			1
it is thought @entity16 had been used as a breeding bitch before being brought to @entity12 's @entity65 as a stray			1
@entity11 said @entity16 's fear of the outdoors is probably a result of being kept in a shed or indoor cage			2
@entity16 's story is due to feature on @entity72 's @entity14 : for the love of dogs this thursday at 8.30pm			2

the six - year - old @entity11 is terrified of the outside world
she is too *scared* to meet *potential* new owners and even other dogs
only leaves her *enclosure* when all the other dogs are asleep and staff gone
believed she was a breeding bitch kept in shed before being found stray
has been in @entity12 's @entity65 kennels since january
but they want to find her new owners who can help *restore* her confidence
@entity12 staff hope @entity14 *tv* appeal will help
