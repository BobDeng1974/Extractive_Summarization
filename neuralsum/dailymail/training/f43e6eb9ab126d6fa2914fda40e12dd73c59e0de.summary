humiliating setback : @entity1 's party voted to scrap the controversial @entity10 on tuesday the @entity18 has led criticism of the government ’s plans to allow so - called ‘ closed material procedures ’ , in which cases are conducted entirely in private , in any civil hearing			1
defendants or claimants will not be allowed to be present , know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security - cleared special advocate , rather than their own lawyer			0
currently , such procedures are used in only a tiny number of immigration and deportation hearings , but the government wants to extend them across the civil courts			1
mr @entity1 has forced the government to make a number of concessions , including abandoning the idea of extending secret justice to inquest hearings			2
voted against bill : delegates at the @entity13 conference in @entity9 voted overwhelmingly to abandon plans for a major extension of ' secret justice ' courts but critics say the proposals still represent a fundamental breach of traditional principles of open justice , and accuse the government of allowing the security services to dictate the legislation			1
spy chiefs were deeply embarrassed by civil court claims against them by terror suspects , which had to be settled out of court rather than having sensitive intelligence material discussed in open hearings			2

@entity75 , the party ’s @entity77 justice and human rights spokesman and a @entity80 , said : ‘ our party ’s core values are at stake on this @entity74			0
standing up for all the proud traditions of our common law system – open justice , the rule of law , accountability of the state for human rights abuses , redress for victims – is essential			0
’ ' secret justice ' : the plans were to allow so - called ' closed material procedures ' where cases are conducted entirely in private , in any civil hearing she added : ‘ secret courts could mean impunity for state officials complicit in wrongdoing like torture			1
‘ if a government puts material before a judge in private , it ca n’t be called proper evidence			1
material which is unchallenged can positively mislead			2
‘ we can and should trust judges , not the state , to distinguish between genuine national security interests and attempted cover - ups			0
‘ @entity1 said we should distinguish those policies we would die in the ditch for from those we could compromise on			0
please jump into the ditch on this one , @entity1			0
’ @entity13 peer lord @entity116 said the proposed legislation was ‘ hopelessly flawed and beyond repair ’ , adding : ‘ this bill is bad for transparency			1
it ’s unfair , it ’s illiberal			0
disaster victims excluded : parliamentary candidate @entity122 that the families of those killed in the @entity125 ( pictured ) could be excluded from court hearings just like victims of torture under the abandoned plans he added that mr @entity1 would now have to tell @entity130 that the party would no longer support the legislation as it made its way through @entity134			2
parliamentary candidate @entity135 told the conference the families of those killed in the @entity125 disaster could just as easily be excluded from court hearings as victims of torture under extraordinary rendition			2
‘ evidence that has not been seen and challenged by the other side is not evidence at all			0
‘ secret justice practically is n’t justice			0
it ’s a dangerous perversion of justice			0
’ sources close to the @entity13 leadership suggested last night it would seek further changes to the legislation			2
