sir @entity0 , 66 , has sparked fierce debate over the site , which includes his own private pier			0
it involves the demolition of the former village hall and the building of marina facilities , flats , shops , restaurants and bars			2
it is due to be heard by @entity48 in the @entity49			0
but already many locals have lodged official objections and even organised a petition			2
taste of @entity55 award winner @entity54 of @entity56 said : ' how in @entity58 's name is another one ( food outlet ) going to benefit anyone ? you say ' it will provide jobs ' i say i will need to pay off staff as there wo n't be enough to go around ! ' think bout ( sic ) this from our point of view ! we graft all year i employ 18 staff which is all year if the business has a downturn i will have to reduce full time workers so another competitor can employ seasonal workers			1
' by all means renovate what existing buildings are there and clean the place up ! if mr @entity84 wants to invest money do it wisely and not to the detriment of all ready struggling businesses ! ! ' overhaul : the harbour of @entity16 in the @entity90 , above , has become the subject of fierce debate after locals claimed sir @entity0 's plans would ' destroy ' local trade cafe owners @entity97 and @entity99 wrote that ' having new retail , catering and carryout facilities would be to the detriment of existing businesses within the village - these businesses are mainly locally owned and provides much needed employment to local people			1

he says he is spending £ 750,000 on helping the village ' , said mr @entity121			1
' he has taken the criticism badly			0
he has received quite a few personal attacks over this and he said to me that ' if they do n't want it he does not need to do it			0
' he will never make money in his lifetime from this			0
investment : the theatre impresario has already invested in the area , part paying for this health centre close to the coast ' @entity0 has been very hurt over it			2
he is very annoyed - here 's somebody willing to spend £ 750,000 to do some good and he is expected to take these attacks that he is destroying a place he loves on the nose ? @entity0 has done so much good for the area over the years - he deserves better than this			1
' mr @entity121 , who used to be the @entity48 councillor for the area added he agreed that @entity16 had too many restaurants , but sir @entity0 had told him he was going to drop the restaurant from the plans and replace it with a bakery			1

friend of the stars : seen here with @entity177 , left and @entity178 , right , sir @entity0 , centre , is the man behind productions such as @entity20 and @entity22 ' we have been speaking to various parties to clarify the situation which is certainly not to commit anything detrimental to other business but would complement those already there and bring even more trade			1
' unless there was strong support in the majority of the community , sir @entity0 would not proceeded against the wishes of the majority of the village			0
' sir @entity0 's motivation has been to help and provide facilities which will improve @entity16 and make it sustainable			1
' if the village community are supportive we will crack on			0
i think any planning application tends to draw objections			0
there is strong support along the majority but we recognise that some of the local businesses have concerns			0
