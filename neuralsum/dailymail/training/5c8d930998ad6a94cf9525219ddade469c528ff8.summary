sports ethics campaigner @entity0 is hoping to shame @entity3 sponsors into backing calls for reform after turning his guns on football ’s tarnished world governing body			1
@entity0 , chairman and owner of compression sportswear market leaders skins , played a part in changing cycling ’s governance and in the battle against doping			0
his focus is now on changing @entity3 after meeting fellow @entity20 @entity19 , who blew the whistle on @entity23 corruption			2
the sports industry leader , who will attend the @entity26 summit next week organised by @entity28 mp @entity27 to debate a new @entity3 , will write to all @entity3 sponsors and related football companies urging them to join the reform bandwagon			1
@entity20 entrepreneur and sports ethics campaigner @entity0 is intent on bringing @entity3 into line @entity0 accepts it 's unlikely that president @entity35 ( right ) , pictured with @entity36 , will be usurped @entity0 said : ‘ i feel it is my duty as part of the industry to call the sports governing bodies to account for their conduct			1
it ’s a disgrace how many influential voices prefer to keep quiet			0
‘ i know it is highly unlikely that @entity35 will be usurped , but it ’s worth the effort and i ’m in this for the long haul to try to improve football ’s leadership , as we did with cycling			1
’ sceptics will see @entity0 ’s involvement as a platform to promote the aims of skins , who will be launching their own @entity62 campaign			2
he does n’t deny those opportunities exist but says any publicity will be far from cheap , given the personal funding involved in the reform projects			2
bookmakers @entity68 have endorsed @entity69 to challenge @entity35 for the @entity3 presidency rampant self - publicists @entity68 will be parading former @entity72 and @entity73 star @entity69 as their endorsed candidate for the @entity3 presidency on friday morning in partnership with another @entity35 - bashing pressure group , @entity76			1
the bookmakers claim it is not a stunt — fat chance ! — but whether their candidate receives the required five nominations from national associations is another matter @entity85 manager @entity84 , who had to abort a player get - together because no date could be agreed , should have held it at the @entity88 on thursday night , where 60 @entity90 players were on the guest list for the @entity93 game between the @entity94 and the @entity95			1
@entity96 ( right ) and @entity97 were two of around 60 @entity90 stars invited to watch the @entity93 game between @entity94 and @entity95 @entity101 legend @entity100 looked less than impressed by the antics of @entity95 mascot @entity104 meanwhile the full house at the @entity106 — and @entity108 ’s decision to extend their @entity93 coverage — makes a mockery of @entity112 ’s withdrawal of funding for elite @entity115 basketball because it lacks olympic medal potential			1
one hopes @entity112 ’s review of their strict criteria will accommodate worthy team sports in future			0
the @entity121 defend having six different @entity85 kits in 15 months by saying that every penny made is reinvested in the game			2
the proceeds made from @entity85 's ever - changing kits wo n't necessarily benefit all fans so what is the latest renovation taking place at @entity130 ? a complete refurbishment ahead of the @entity23 of that hub of grass - roots rugby — the royal box			0
this girl 's gone viral @entity85 ’s @entity138 campaign has exceeded 5,000,000 plays on @entity140 since it was launched last monday — strong evidence of the immediate impact of the £ 10million project to give women of all shapes , sizes and abilities the confidence to do more sport and exercise			1
the bold 90 - second video aimed at taking away the fear of sport — with lines such as ‘ sweating like a pig , feeling like a fox ’ — is targeting women between 14 and 40 , a demographic which has 2,000,000 fewer participants in regular sport than its male counterpart			0
the @entity138 campaign is giving women confidence to exercise , with over half a million plays on @entity140 there has been criticism from national governing bodies that the tv advertising blitz over the next five weeks , and then again in may and june , will not effect enough change to justify the cost			1
indeed , some have called it a vanity project for @entity85 ceo @entity175 and minister for sport @entity176 , who approved the funding			0
but @entity175 said : ‘ we have had fantastic feedback and the cost is minimal compared to what we hand out to sport			0
this is a much - needed campaign which i ’ve wanted to do for some time but needed @entity184 backing for the spend			0
’ it has caused some consternation in the shires that @entity190 ’s @entity189 is giving interviews as if he were already in situ as the new chairman of the @entity194			0
that is likely to happen but nominations for the post do n’t close until the end of the month and any appointment needs to be ratified by the 41 @entity194 stakeholders .			0

@entity202 will write to all @entity3 sponsors asking them to back a reform
