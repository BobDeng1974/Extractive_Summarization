by @entity0 for @entity1 with the average @entity4 wedding now costing around $ 36,000 , it pays to shop around			1
an undercover investigation by @entity6 has discovered that brides are routinely charged more for services than other customers , with vendors charging up to $ 8,000 more if they know the event they 're catering was a wedding			1
despite the price discrepancies discovered in the investigation , the situation has improved somewhat for brides , compared to five years ago , when @entity6 last conducted an investigation into wedding costs			2
this has been put down to increased competition in the industry as more ‘ hobbyists ' enter the wedding business			0
to test the added charges attracted by weddings , @entity6 hired two shadow shoppers to source quotes from venues , photographers , florists , hire car companies , cake companies and photo booth hire companies across a range of demographics in both @entity36 and @entity37			1
vendors charge considerably more if they know the event they are catering for is a wedding rather than another gathering @entity43 approached vendors telling them she was planning a low - key wedding for 80 people and asking them how much each item would cost			1
@entity48 then approached the same vendors a week later asking them for a quote on the same item on the same day , but telling them she was hosting a 40th birthday party for her partner			1
the wedding - shopper was quoted prices significantly higher than the woman shopping for a party , across almost all categories			2
venue both women approached venues , asking them for a quote on a three - course , sit - down dinner			0
three of the six venues approached by the shoppers charged @entity43 more when they discovered she was planning a wedding			1
one quoted her $ 9,600 compared to $ 7,200 quoted to @entity48 for the party ; another quoted $ 1,700 for the wedding and $ 1,300 for the party			2
a third venue told @entity43 they could not do a price - per - head for her wedding , but would instead charge her between $ 12,000 and $ 18,000 for the event			1
but when the same venue was approached by @entity48 a week later they said they could cater her event for $ 125 per person , a total cost of $ 10,000 for 80 people , thousands of dollars cheaper than the quote offered to @entity43			2
one cake company quoted @entity43 $ 590 for a wedding cake and @entity48 $ 220 for an identical ' birthday cake ' cake both women approached six cake companies and asked the price of a white chocolate mud cake to feed 80 people with flowers on top to be delivered on the same day			1
in two cases the bride was quoted significantly more than the other woman : @entity43 was quoted $ 590 compared to $ 220 for @entity48 and another shop quoted @entity43 $ 670 , whereas @entity48 was told the same cake would cost her between $ 500 and $ 600			0
hire car companies approached by the two women also charged extra if they knew the event was a wedding			0
hire car six hire car companies were approached and were asked how much it would cost to pick them up at an inner - city suburb and drop off an hour away			0
three of those six companies told @entity43 , the wedding - shopper , that they did not do one - hour call - outs and so only provided her with quotes for three - hour call - outs , despite her insistence she only wanted the car for one hour			0
but those same companies were happy to provide a one - hour quote to @entity48 , the party - shopper			0
one company quoted @entity43 $ 1,500 compared to $ 650 for @entity48 ; another quoted @entity43 $ 990 compared to $ 300 for @entity48 ; and the third company quoted @entity43 $ 1,000 and @entity48 $ 450 , meaning that @entity43 was quoted up to $ 850 more because she wanted the cars for a wedding rather than a 40th birthday party			1
the graph shows the average difference in the amount brides are charged for elements of their wedding , compared to the amount charged to someone throwing a non-wedding event venues charged people dramatically different prices depending whether or not the event was a wedding photographer like the hire car companies , some photographers were unwilling to be flexible when it came to a wedding package , whereas they were more willing to be flexible for a birthday party			1
because wedding photographers often spend the whole day with a couple , in order to make the comparison fair , @entity43 , the wedding - shopper told photographers she was having a very informal wedding and that a photographer was only required at the reception to capture the festivities and some semi-formal photos of friends and family with the bride and groom for two hours			2
@entity48 then approached the same photographers to ask if they would attend the birthday party for two hours to capture photos of the festivities and some semi-formal shots of family and friends			1
two photographers told both women that they would not accept a booking for just two hours			0
one photographer quoted $ 400 to the bride without a confirmed venue , yet told the party girl he would n't provide a quote until she confirmed the venue			1
one @entity36 photographer quoted @entity48 , the party - shopper $ 1495 for two hours , but quoted @entity43 $ 4750 for a five - hour package , despite her insistence that she only needed someone for two hours			1
this photographer tried to put emotional pressure on @entity43 to accept the five - hour package , being told ‘ this is the most amazing day of your life – we capture that emotion , we tell that story			0
you can go back and relive the whole day through the photos '			0
photo booth photo booth vendors were generally fair to brides , with all of them quoting the same prices to both @entity43 and @entity48 , with the exception of one photo booth company , which added an extra $ 50 fee onto the quote for the wedding			2
flowers to make the comparison fair , the florists were presented with identical requests - white flowers to decorate the tables , with @entity43 telling the florists a friend would be making her bouquet			0
so that the quotes were comparable , @entity43 would approach a florist and ask for recommendations of white flowers and when @entity48 would approach the same florist a week later , she would request arrangements using the same flowers , to account for seasonal variation			0
the overall cost of white flowers to decorate eight tables ranged from $ 600 to $ 1,200 and florists quoted the same prices to both @entity43 and @entity48			0
the investigation found that flowers were generally exempt from a ' wedding ' premium			0

vendors charge more for the same services if they know the event they are catering is a wedding
venues and photographers are the worst *offenders*
with one venue charging $ 8,000 more for a wedding than for an identical function they were told was a 40th birthday party
@entity238 investigation used secret shoppers to test 36 vendors in @entity36 and @entity37
