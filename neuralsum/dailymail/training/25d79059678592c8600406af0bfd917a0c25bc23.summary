mrs @entity5 , from @entity30 , in the @entity31 , s aid : ' we 're so proud of our girls			2
' @entity18 has been able to watch her sister reach lots of milestones , and through copying has been able to reach them too			2
' @entity11 has shown her sister how to roll over and sit up , and even walk			1
' when @entity39 began to speak , she was saying words that she 'd heard her sister say			0
' even now , as the girls learn to read , @entity11 will help @entity39 sound out words when she gets confused			2
' we have always believed in @entity43 and we know she 'll do well , but @entity11 has made a huge difference to her			2
' they certainly have that twin thing going on - they 're soul mates			0
' the couple first noticed @entity11 's huge influence on her twin sister when the girls were learning to walk			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' we were starting to worry as @entity18 had got to 18 months old and she still was n't walking - the cerebral palsy has really affected her right leg so it was a concern			1
cerebral palsy is the general term for conditions that affect movement and co-ordination			1
it is estimated that 1 in 400 people in the @entity61 is affected			0
it is caused by problems in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles			0
the condition occurs if the brain is damaged before , during or shorly after birth , usually due to loss of oxygen			2
it can be caused by a difficult or premature birth , an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy , bleeding in the baby â€™s brain or mutations in genes that affect brain development			2
the symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child 's life			1
the main symptoms are : muscle stiffness or floppiness muscle weakness random and uncontrolled body movements balance and co-ordination problems the symptoms can affect different areas of the body and will vary in severity from person to person			0
some people will only have minor problems , whereas others will be severely disabled			0
many people with cerebral palsy also have a number of associated problems , including repeated seizures or fits , drooling problems and difficulty swallowing			1
some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties , although intelligence is often unaffected			1
' a physiotherapist came to the house to try and teach her some exercises to help her walk , but she just was n't getting it			0
' but then all of a sudden @entity11 stood up next to @entity39 and showed her what to do			2
' @entity39 copied her sister immediately , and before we knew it she had learnt to walk			2
' it was amazing - even the therapists agree that watching and copying her sister has had a huge impact on her			2
' we 'd already started to wonder if @entity39 was looking to @entity11 to teach her things , but this proved it for us			2
' since then , @entity39 has continued to copy her sister , and has continued to progress well			2
mrs @entity5 said : ' @entity18 is a little behind other children her age , but copying her sister has helped her develop			1
' @entity39 used to be nervous about walking on grass - as she was a little unstable already with her leg she did n't really like it , but @entity11 would hold her hand and show her what to do , and now she 's fine with it			2
' @entity18 has learnt how to use felt tips and do jigsaws because @entity11 does them all the time , and will show her how they work			0
' even when they were learning to talk , @entity39 would repeat her sister			1
' @entity11 would ask us for a drink , and then before we knew it so would @entity39 - it 's really been incredible			0
' when @entity11 and @entity39 were born two and a half months early in february 2010 , medics raced to keep the tiny babies alive			0
after a tricky start to life , @entity11 was discharged after two months , but her twin sister faced a bigger struggle			1
mr @entity151 said : ' when they were born neither of the girls could breathe on their own			0
' it was a really scary time as we just expected to have two healthy babies - we were shell shocked			0
' after initial breathing problem , @entity11 was doing really well , whilst @entity39 developed a very serious bowel condition called neonatal necrotising enterocolitis - her bowel had started to die and was spreading to her other intestines			0
' we did n't know if she was going to make it , but luckily they were able to operate and save her life			0
' after the operation they gave @entity18 a brain scan and they noticed she had dark spots on her white brain matter			0
' we had no idea what this meant but the doctors explained she 'd developed periventricular leukomalacia ( @entity173 ) - a form of brain damage that can lead to cerebral palsy			1
' we think she may have developed it due to the stress and trauma of her birth and operations - but we 'll never know 100 per cent			0
while @entity18 is behind other children her age in terms of her development , she has made great progress thanks to her sister , her parents claim @entity11 and @entity39 were born two and a half months early in february 2010 , and medics had to race to keep the tiny babies alive ' it was horrible to learn that @entity39 had this , but each day she slowly got better , and six months later she was finally discharged - it was a huge relief			1
' finally at home together , @entity151 and mrs @entity5 wondered whether their twins would ever bond after spending so much time apart			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' i really worried that they would n't be close or they would n't get on , because they 'd basically been separated from birth , but it was exactly the opposite			1
' from day one @entity11 has been a source of help and encouragement to her sister - she 's like a little mother hen			1
' now , at age four , the girls are continuing to surprise their parents , and grow closer every day			0
mrs @entity5 said : ' they 've recently started dance classes together and they love it			0
' @entity11 will always find things easier than her sister , but @entity18 is coming on leaps and bounds and we could n't be prouder			1
mr @entity151 is now hoping to compete in the @entity216 next year in aid of @entity218			0
he added : ' @entity39 is doing better and better each day , and she 's achieving so much			0
' we think that @entity11 has grown into a very compassionate child - whenever a child in her class is upset she 'll always be the one to help			0
' we 're incredibly proud of both of our girls			0
