all eyes were on @entity1 this afternoon as he made the short trip across @entity3 to face @entity4 in the west @entity3 derby			1
@entity6 was the place where the @entity9 skipper racially abused then @entity4 defender @entity10 in october 2011			1
@entity10 's brother @entity12 was injured for sunday 's match			2
@entity1 , who has been a crucial part of @entity17 's @entity16 title bid this season , played the full 90 minutes however as @entity9 scraped a 1 - 0 win , but how did he get on ... @entity1 ( centre ) celebrates at the final whistle with @entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 reception there was a hostile introduction for @entity1 as the teams lined up , before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute			1
there was , however , no noticeable reaction from any of @entity37 's players until @entity38 made himself known to the centre - back late in the first half with a robust challenge			0
@entity1 experienced a hostile atmosphere at @entity6 , but put in a good display at the back for @entity9 temperament it was a moment to cherish for the @entity4 fans as @entity48 responded to an arm across the chest by shoving @entity1 to the ground off the ball			1
the @entity9 skipper momentarily lost his cool and berated the assistant referee to the delight of the crowd			2
his battle with the striker continued into the second half , with the pair taken aside for a word after squaring up to each other but it was @entity1 who had the last laugh as @entity67 ' late equaliser sealed three points			2
the @entity9 captain rises above @entity70 to head the ball away as he dominated at the back performance the former @entity75 captain was rarely troubled by @entity70 and @entity38			0
although the pair were prominent throughout , a lack of pace meant @entity1 and partner @entity79 were able to deal with everything thrown at them even though they were bailed out by @entity83 at times			0
there was a nervy moment in the first half when a long ball over the top caught out the 34 - year - old , and he was lucky his misjudged touch did n't cost the side as @entity79 covered , but it was a fairly comfortable day for the defender			0
the @entity9 captain was made to stretch occasionally , but he and @entity93 dealt with @entity4 's threat well conduct despite an obvious attempt from @entity48 to get under the skin of @entity1 , he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity			1
there were wild celebrations from @entity1 at the final whistle as he responded to the constant jeers			0
@entity1 's combative encounter with @entity38 attracted the attention of referee @entity110			0

@entity1 racially abused @entity10 at the ground in october 2011
@entity1 is always the subject of crowds anger when he returns to @entity4
however , he performed well as @entity9 *snatched* late winner
