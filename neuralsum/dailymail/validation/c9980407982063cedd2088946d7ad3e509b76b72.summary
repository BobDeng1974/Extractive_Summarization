we are constantly being nagged to floss , with dental experts claiming it can add years to our life			1
but according to one dentist , most of us have been doing it incorrectly for years			1
dr @entity7 , a dentist from @entity8 , has released a video showing the best way to floss teeth in order to have the healthiest smile			1
‘ brushing is great but it ’s not enough - you need flossing to remove the bacteria between the teeth , ’ he says			2
dr @entity18 has released a video showing his ' one minute flossing technique ' which he says helps rid the mouth of bacteria			1
he is pictured holding floss between two thumbs , about an inch apart he advises taking a piece of wax dental floss and winding it up with the index fingers , but not so tightly that it hurts			1
when flossing the upper row of teeth , put the thumbs around an inch apart from each other on the floss			2
dr @entity7 said : ‘ the reason why most people have a problem flossing is that they try to get too much floss in their mouths			1
‘ the way to control it is to use your thumbs for your upper teeth and middle fingers for your lower teeth			0
‘ put that amount of floss between these fingers so you can manipulate it easily from one side to the next			0
’ then , put the floss between two teeth and floss in and up and down motion along the teeth , rather than a sawing motion from side to side			2
take a piece of wax dental floss and put each thumb about and inch apart 2			0
put the floss between the upper teeth 3			0
keeping the back thumb stationary , move the front thumb up and down to floss the tooth 4			0
do not floss in a ' sawing motion ' - back and forth - but up and down , rubbing the floss up and down the tooth 5			2
repeat using the middle fingers for the bottom teeth ‘ we ’re flossing the walls of one tooth and the other tooth and polishing the bacteria off those surfaces , ’ dr @entity7 said			1
one thumb should stay stationary while the other thumb is moved up and down , creating the flossing motion			1
similarly , when flossing the lower teeth , one middle finger should stay stationary while the other is moved , it in order to manipulate the floss so it rubs up and down against the inside of the tooth			0
dr @entity7 says this method , which takes just a minute , is the best and most efficient way to floss			1
he said : ‘ it takes a minute and it really makes a difference to dental health			2
’ in the past , studies have shown that flossing teeth can prevent the build up of plaque , which sticks to teeth and causes irritation , inflammation to gums known as gum disease			0
gum disease causes bad breath , bleeding gums and , if untreated , cavities , receding gums and tooth loss			0
@entity111 , 15 - 20 per cent of adults aged 35 - 44 years have severe gum disease , which may result in the loss of teeth			0
he advises using two thumbs for the upper teeth , or two middle fingers for the lower teeth , and flossing in an ' up and down ' motion rather than ' sawing ' from side to side in the @entity123 , the @entity122 of 2009 found 47 per cent of the population had moderate to severe gum disease - around 30 million people			1
research shows losing teeth could signal a higher risk of suffering heart disease and diabetes			0
@entity133 researchers found people with fewer teeth and bleeding gums were more likely to have a range of cardiovascular problems , including heart disease , high blood pressure and high cholesterol			0
they found poor dental hygiene and bleeding gums could allow up to 700 different types of bacteria to get into the bloodstream , which increases the risk of a heart attack regardless of how fit and healthy the person is			1
previous studies have also linked bad teeth to @entity152 's , heart disease , strokes , diabetes , lung disease and even miscarriage and premature birth .			0
