’ the court heard the victim was a ‘ troubled ’ child who had told lies to get attention			1

in a video interview with police played to jurors , the schoolgirl said : ‘ i felt special			2

and admitting that does kind of hurt			0
’ she said ‘ hand on heart ’ @entity4 would never have made a move on her without her encouragement , and that she fell ‘ in love ’ with him			1
she told a detective : ‘ i knew it was wrong , but it felt right as well ... there was always a little voice at the back of my head saying “ he ’s just using you ”			2
’ @entity4 denied all the charges , saying the girl was a ‘ devious and wicked liar ’			2
he claimed she had found out details about him – including the type of underwear he wore and about a scar on his back – from eavesdropping on his conversations with other teachers			0
@entity4 said she also knew information about his home because he had given a presentation about his home life to pupils			2
but she was able to draw a detailed plan of his £ 500,000 detached home in @entity229 , @entity230 , for police , pinpointing the guest bedroom where they had sex on october 3 , 2012			0
mr @entity235 said : ‘ it ’s possible that [ the victim ] could have found out things but she would have to be a real detective to find out everything ’			0
he added : ‘ somebody is lying , it ’s either [ the victim ] or mr @entity4 , whoever it is is telling very wicked lies ... [ if it ’s @entity4 ] he ’s deceived his friends , his colleagues at school and his wife ’			1

she said @entity4 bought her a souvenir @entity28 keyring			2
the girl ’s mother later found a keyring matching its description in a box in her bedroom			0
jurors were told how @entity4 took the pupil 's virginity in the same week his wife @entity32 ( both pictured outside court today ) suffered a miscarriage			1
