@entity0 wants his @entity2 stars to be inspired to @entity4 victory by the words of the legendary @entity6			1
the home captain , who dropped a minor selection bombshell by floating the idea of dissolving the @entity12 - @entity11 partnership , revealed on monday that one of the recently - departed @entity15 ’s favourite quotes had been given pride of place in the @entity19 team room at @entity20			1
@entity0 , a former pupil of the coaching great who passed away during this year ’s @entity23 , said : ‘ it ’s just a simple message			1
it ’s the last message they see before they leave the locker room and it ’s a quote from @entity6 , who unfortunately passed away a couple of months ago , as we all know			1
the late , great coach @entity6 's words will be printed in the @entity2 locker room @entity0 played under @entity6 and hopes the legendary coach 's words will inspire his team ‘ he used to say to every player on the range , as we walked to the first tee , he would shake your hand and say : “ happiest days of your lives			1
” and that ’s the quote , that ’s the last thing they will see as they leave the locker room			1
’ the fact that @entity12 and @entity11 are involved on opposite sides of a contractual dispute involving @entity12 ’s former management company has been repeatedly downplayed by @entity0 , who again insisted yesterday that the pair being at loggerheads in court would n’t prevent him from pairing the @entity57 irishmen together again			1
but , alluding to a points tally that belies the general view of the @entity62 @entity61 axis as a power duo , he said he may have good golfing reasons to break them up			2
speaking about the court case , @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s not an issue and it ’s not been an issue for me in terms of @entity4 captaincy over the last year , certainly , since these court proceedings started			2
both of them have assured me all along that there are no issues and that ’s the way i ’ve always seen it			0
@entity78 1 @entity12 may not be paired with fellow @entity79 @entity11 at the @entity4 ‘ whether they come together or not is another story			1
three or four months ago , i had a very strong view that they would have been but , the more i look at their statistics and the more i look at the different value i have with them , i ’m thinking there may be a value in not doing it			0
‘ but if i do n’t do it , it certainly wo n’t be because of any issues			0
as both of them have said , there are no issues between them and both of them will be happy to play together but it will be my decision ultimately			0
@entity12 could be partnered with @entity101 instead if @entity0 opts for a different approach at @entity20 ‘ i ’ve got lots of options with them			1
but if i do n’t decide to play them , it would be for tactical reasons			0
it wo n’t be for any other reasons			0
‘ they have played six @entity4 matches and they have only won two together			2
it ’s not like these guys are written in stone			0
they are not a formidable fourball pairing that ’s unbeatable			0
‘ having said that , there ’s no reason why they would n’t play together			0
when i was captain of the @entity120 i had them paired together and they played very well in that			2
so i ’ve got lots of options with them - but it does n’t have to be that they have to be together			2
’ video pundits provide insight into potential pairings			0
