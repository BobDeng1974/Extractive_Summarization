by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 10 june 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 11 june 2012 among a rapidly dwindling band , no one epitomises the courage and heroism of the @entity6 veterans more than @entity7			1
a survivor of 92 missions during five years of service in the @entity12 , the highly decorated rear gunner was shot down twice – once behind enemy lines – but lived to fight another day			1
now aged 91 and a wheelchair user , he could have expected to be a vip guest at the unveiling of a long - awaited £ 6.5million bomber command memorial in @entity18 in central @entity19			1
war hero : rear gunner @entity21 , 91 , who has been denied a ticket to the unveiling of the £ 6.5million bomber command memorial but despite his distinguished service and years of work helping to raise money for the memorial appeal , mr @entity7 has been told he can not attend the ceremony on june 28 because there are no tickets left			1
the memorial , a sculpture which features seven bomber air crew members , is expected to be unveiled by the @entity34			1
it is seen as overdue recognition for the bomber crews whose place in history has been widely played down because of the high number of civilian deaths they caused			1
mr @entity7 's family are furious about the snub			0
they found out too late that veterans had to apply for tickets , like anyone else wanting to attend			2
now the entire allocation has been taken up , largely by relatives of those who served on the bombers , and mr @entity7 has been told he ca n't go			1
his daughter @entity54 , 56 , said : ' how can they expect a 91 - year - old war veteran to sort this out himself ? war heroes : @entity21 ( fourth from right , second row up ) with his squadron during the war serviceman : @entity21 and his wife @entity63 , pictured during @entity12 , will be unable to attend the memorial unveiling ' he 's a member of the @entity65 so it could n't have been that hard to trace him and invite him to the ceremony			1
' we feel that precedence should be given to those who were actually there			0
' mr @entity7 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , supported numerous fundraising events over the years which finally led to the memorial being given the go ahead			2
he said : ' i would have loved to have gone			0
i was very pleased when i heard it was being built			0
' like many other veterans he was determined that the 55,573 bomber crew who lost their lives should be given a fitting memorial			1
mr @entity7 was 20 when he joined the @entity65			0
as a rear gunner he had a life expectancy of six weeks , but went on to survive the entire war and earn six medals , including the @entity87 , in the process			1
tribute : mr @entity7 has raised funds for the £ 6.5million bomber command memorial in @entity18 , @entity19 there were 25 missions over @entity94 , as well as stints in @entity96 and @entity97 in @entity99 and @entity100 bombers			1
mr @entity7 's closest shave came at @entity102 in 1942 when his plane was shot down			2
he survived by a stroke of luck when the turret of his plane where he was sitting came away as the aircraft crashed into the desert			0
the front end of the plane exploded , killing four men on board , but he survived			0
despite being behind enemy lines he marched off into the desert and was picked up by a group of @entity117 soldiers who had spotted the crash			0
decorated : @entity7 was involved in 91 bombing raids during the war - and survived being shot down twice a second crash occurred when his plane was shot down near the @entity96 border , and on this occasion everyone survived			1
the rear gunner badly damaged his leg in another operation and was in hospital when his medal and letter from the @entity130 arrived			0
he still has pins in his legs and suffers severe arthritis			0
he remains fiercely proud of his war years and his wife @entity63 , 85 , believes the authorities have let him down			2
she said : ' it 's a shame			0
there ca n't be that many veterans left who saw such long service and were presented with so many medals			1
this memorial is what my husband has been waiting for			2
at one point in the war the bombers were all we had			2
' the memorial organisers said that they were extremely sorry that mr @entity7 and other veterans had been unable to get tickets to the event			1
a spokesman said : ' the problem is we have been absolutely overwhelmed by demand for tickets			2
we have a licence limiting us to 6,500 guests which we can not exceed , and have prioritised two groups – people who lost relatives such as husbands and fathers , and veterans who flew in the planes			0
' but we still probably have at least 1,000 people who would like to attend but can not come			0
other events will be staged at the memorial later in the year and we would hope that people who can not get a ticket this time will be able to attend one of those functions			0

@entity180 , 91 , won six medals during the war
he was shot down twice during 92 bombing raids
but despite his efforts , *bureaucrats* say there are no tickets left for the unveiling so he ca n't go
new bomber command memorial will be unveiled by the @entity34 in @entity18 , @entity19 on june 28
