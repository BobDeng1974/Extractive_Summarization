@entity2 is one of three dogs that belong to @entity10 and her husband , who is an airman who has recently been servicing a six - month stretch in @entity13			1
as this heart - warming video shows , while the other dogs , @entity15 and @entity16 , race to greet their owner , @entity2 is left trailing in third place			2
however that does n't prevent her from moving as quickly as she can with only her front paws to propel her			0

her combined conditions mean her front legs are bowed out and her hind legs are essentially useless			1
