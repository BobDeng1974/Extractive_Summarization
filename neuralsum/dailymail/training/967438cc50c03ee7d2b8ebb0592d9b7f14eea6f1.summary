by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 1 june 2012 the @entity2 probe delivered samples of lunar soil from a six - foot depth , and found the first evidence of water on the moon - but the finding was ignored by @entity11 scientists in august 1976 , a @entity13 rocket landed on the moon , drilled six feet into the surface , extracted about half a pound of rock and flew back			1
in the rocks that it brought back , water made up around 0.1 %			0
it was the first time any spacecraft had found conclusive evidence of water on the moon			1
the @entity26 @entity25 landings had brought back moon rocks , but the samples were thought to have been contaminated with water from @entity30			1
in 1976 , the evidence of water was an earth - shattering discovery - but it was almost entirely ignored in the @entity33			2
the paper , published in the @entity13 journal @entity36 , which had an @entity38 version , has never been cited by any @entity11 scientist - despite the fact that in one small sample it found something that eluded the @entity44 's best efforts			1
the @entity25 missions brought back 300 kilos of moon rock to @entity30			0
@entity48 's clementine mission bounced radio waves off the surface of the moon in 1994 , and found evidence of water			1
@entity54 at @entity55 in @entity56 says , ' no other author has ever cited the @entity2 work			0
' the fact that the @entity33 ignored it may well have put back @entity11 science by decades			2
crystals of moon rock : despite the fact that the @entity26 @entity25 missions brought back 300 kilos of moon rock , they failed to do what the @entity13 did - and prove the existence of water on the mooon scientists understimated the amount of water on the moon as recently as 2006			0
' as recently as 2006 the settled value for the lunar bulk water content was below 1 part per billion			0
most values now discussed well exceed 1 part per million , ' says @entity54 .			0

@entity78 *dug* six feet into moon 's surface
returned first evidence of water on moon
finding completely ignored by @entity44
