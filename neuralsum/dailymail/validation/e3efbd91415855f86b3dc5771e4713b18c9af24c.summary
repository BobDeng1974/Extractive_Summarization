the mother of a two - year - old who is allergic to the sun wants her daughter 's condition to be recognised as a disability			1
@entity6 has two rare skin conditions , photo - aggravated eczema and solar urticaria , which cause her to break out in painful welts when she spends just seconds in direct sunlight			1
but it is not just the outside of @entity14 that suffers when she is exposed , it is her insides too			2
when she does , the only way to soothe her is to wrap her up in bandages ( pictured above with her doll also named @entity14 ) @entity14 , 2 , has suffered from the condition since she was born			1
she is pictured on the right with her late cat , @entity27 mother @entity28 , from @entity29 on @entity31 ' mid-north coast , told @entity32 her daughter gets headaches and stomach pains along with becoming lethargic and dizzy			1
' a gp just told us she gets [ the symptoms ] outside as well as inside her body , ' the 28 - year - old said			2
to help prevent this from happening , @entity14 wears a head - to - toe bodysuit to cover up as well as slathering on sunscreen and zinc , and wearing a hat and sunglasses			1
ms @entity6 said it was mission for the family to go shopping or to the doctor 's , and lately the two - year - old 's reactions had become so severe that they have had to start carrying around an epipen			2
mother @entity28 ( pictured left with her son , @entity55 , and @entity14 ) is fighting to have daughter 's conditions recognised as a disability exposure to the sun causes painful welts and means @entity14 spends most of the night awake			1
ms @entity6 said she averages four hours sleep on ' a good night ' the flare - ups could also be caused by fluoroscent lights inside shopping centres she said @entity14 's flare - ups could happen any time her daughter stepped into the sunlight			1
she could be outside for 20 seconds or just a matter of minutes before she would break out			0
' we just remain as indoors as much as humanly possibly , ' mr @entity69 said			0
' we run into the shops as fast as we can from the car			0
' if we wanted to go shopping , she ’d have a flare up from the fluorescent lights			0
' when @entity14 's skin does break out in welts , the only way to soothe her is to put her in a bleach bath , apply steroid creams , and then wrap her in wet and dry layers of bandages			1
this happens so often now that the little girl becomes distraught when she sees her mother getting out any type of cream			0
' she 's become extremely scared of creams			2
when she sees the sunscreen or steroid creams come out she starts crying , ' ms @entity92 told @entity32			0
' she 's had enough of being creamed up 24 hours a day			1
at night , she breaks down and starts crying because she 's so itchy and in pain			2

ms @entity6 recently had to quit her job to become @entity14 's full - time carer to prevent her breaking out , @entity14 dons a head - to - toe bodysuit ( pictured ) along with slathering on sunscreen and wearing sunglasses this is @entity14 's every day life and her welts can last for 20 minutes to several hours			1
broken sleep patterns are the norm for her and ms @entity92 who averages about four hours a night on ' a good night '			1
' it ’s extremely heart breaking to watch her in so much pain			0
now that she is at the age where she can put two and two together she asks from the back seat while we 're driving to doctors : " why does the sun hate me , @entity117 ? " , ' ms @entity92 said			0
' it just shatters my heart for her when she thinks that the sun hates her			0
' on top of looking after @entity14 , ms @entity6 also has an autistic five - year - old son , @entity55			2
she recently had to quit her job to become a full - time carer			2
people point and laugh at @entity14 ( left ) when she is in her bodysuit ( right ) and ms @entity6 wants that to stop by raising awareness of her daughter 's conditions the single mother - of - two has started up a fundraising campaign to help her cover the costs of caring for @entity14 , which include a special $ 50 sunscreen and $ 200 in fuel costs a month to visit a doctor in @entity140			1
ms @entity6 said she spends at least $ 200 a week on meeting @entity14 's needs alone			1
she gets no other assistance from the @entity143 other than a carer 's allowance because they do not recognise @entity14 's conditions as a disability			1
' i ca n't work because of how demanding her needs are			0
no employer is going to be okay with me taking every second week off because @entity14 is in hospital , ' she said			2
ms @entity6 says she has reached breaking point while caring for @entity14 and is trying to get more help at first , ms @entity92 used her miracle for @entity157 page to raise awareness of her daughter 's conditions because people were laughing and pointing at her in the street when she wore her bodysuit			1
' in the beginning , she was pointed at and laughed at , not just by kids but adults too			0
she picks up on it now and i want everyone in the world to know [ about her conditions ] and stop laughing at her , ' ms @entity92 said			0
' i want people to understand the struggles she ’s going through			0
' we have people ask her what ’s wrong with her and i tell them she ’s allergic to the sun and people say : " thank goodness , i thought she had been burnt "			0
' i 'm not saying being burnt is not bad , but there 's a light at the end of the tunnel			0
whereas @entity14 is in constant pain and doctors are happy to say stay home			0
