by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 5 february 2013 these fascinating images show labourers harvesting forced rhubarb in vast , candlelit sheds at a farm that helped catapult the versatile plant back into popularity			1
seasonal labourers at @entity10 's @entity9 in @entity12 's famous @entity11 are busy carefully pulling up the early salmon - pink sticks , which are nurtured indoors from around november			0
the rhubarb is traditionally harvested by candlelight because strong light will stop the growth			1
in the pink : labourers carefully pull up the stems at @entity10 's @entity9 in @entity12 's @entity11 season simulator : the tender early variety is kept in darkness because strong light will stop growth the roots are only taken out of the soil and into the forcing shed after they have received the necessary amount of frost , specific to each variety			2
in the warmth and complete darkness , the plant has to use its own energy reserves , because it has no access to food or light			1
the stored carbohydrate in the roots is transformed into glucose , giving the forced rhubarb its distinctive , bittersweet flavour			1
the forced variety is more tender than that grown outdoors in the summer			2
rhubarb is a native of @entity44 and thrives in the wet cold winters in @entity12			2
@entity12 once produced 90 per cent of the world 's winter forced rhubarb from the forcing sheds that were common across the fields there			1
roots : the nine - square - mile @entity11 in @entity12 was the world centre for production hero : @entity55 has become affectionately known by the media as the ‘ @entity57 of @entity11 ’ the early winter frost converts the root energy store into a form accessible to the plant for growth when it is taken into the sheds			1
the 9 - square - mile @entity11 in @entity12 is famous for producing early forced rhubarb			1
in 1875 , it became the first place in the world to build special sheds for growing rhubarb out of season			0
the @entity12 coalfields provided a cheap local source of fuel to heat the sheds			0
as rhubarb ’s popularity increased , so did the producers in this area , numbering well over 200 at rhubarb ’s height in popularity			1
the quality of the @entity12 crop became renowned , and demand for it became so huge that producers in other areas of @entity88 could not compete , and eventually stopped altogether			1
got enough custard ? there were more than 200 producers in the area at the height of rhubarb 's popularity stemming the tide : rhubarb fell out of popularity in wartime , when families on sugar rations found it too bitter the producers were centralised in a frost pocket in the shadow of the @entity104 between @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , which became known as @entity11			1
geographically centrally positioned in @entity88 , coincidentally where railroads crossed , gave the producers a transport system to any corner of the country , so that the harvest could be in the market the next morning			1
@entity118 ' @entity117 ' trains left the area nightly , mostly bound for the old @entity121 market , and from there large amounts were sold on into @entity123			0
but wartime @entity88 ’s palate was rather on the sweet side thanks to rationing , and they simply could not get the sugar that they required to bring this sharp flavoured vegetable to their taste			2
top of the crops : the rhubarb is examined for quality by the labourers new leaf : the vegetable is back into popularity thanks to the efforts of farms and celebrity chefs tender is the night : later varieties generally have a deeper colour than the earlier , salmon pink crop after the war , as overseas trade began and quick easy refrigerated logistics made a wide range of new tropical fruits readily available , rhubarb was left on the shelf			2
now , however , the humble plant is experiencing something of a revival , with celebrity chefs including @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 singing the praises of @entity11			0
the @entity9 farm has received many awards for its vital role in bringing rhubarb back to the masses			0
@entity55 has become affectionately known by the media as the ‘ @entity57 of @entity11 ’			0
the earliest recorded use of rhubarb is @entity169 , although its use is thought to date back much further			0
it was very important drug used for a variety of ailments particularly gut , lung and liver problems			0
@entity176 is attributed with bringing the drug to @entity123 in the 13th century , when it was referred to as the @entity178 root			0
the drug was so sought - after that in 1657 in @entity180 , it could command three times the price of @entity182			0
by the 16th century , seeds had been introduced in @entity88 , but the wrong strain was imported and its use went into decline because the @entity187 version did not work			2
rhubarb was first used in @entity180 cooking in the late 18th century , probably in an attempt to get the benefits of the drug into the body , only gaining in favour with the @entity187 when the forcing process was accidentally discovered in @entity195 in 1817 .			0

forced rhubarb traditionally harvested in *dim* conditions
plant *relies* on its own energy *resources* and produces glucose in roots
creates distinctive bittersweet flavour that is *regaining* popularity in @entity88
