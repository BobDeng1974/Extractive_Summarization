the teenager suffering from a rare genetic condition turning her into a ' human mannequin ' has spoken out about how she refuses to be beaten by her disease			1
@entity4 has a rare genetic condition which causes each of her joints to lock as the muscle turns into bone			1
the 19 - year - old was born with @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , a genetic disease which causes soft tissue to turn into bone , freezing her body permanently into place			1
with no known cure , the life expectancy of those with @entity11 is just 41			2
it could only be a matter of years before miss @entity27 is frozen in an upright position , needing a standing wheelchair to get around			1
but the teenager , from @entity32 in @entity33 , told @entity35 's @entity34 : ' it ’s never going to stop me from doing what i want to do			1
' she already defied the odds to attend her school prom despite being home - schooled for the majority of her education , and has now taken the first steps in a fashion career , doing work experience at @entity48 then at @entity49			2
with no known cure , the life expectancy of those with @entity11 is just 41			2
it could only be a matter of years before miss @entity53 is frozen in an upright position			1
right : appearing in a @entity56 documentary aired tonight she told @entity58 : ' no one has ever treated me any differently and my friends and family are a good support system ' miss @entity4 ’s story has been captured in @entity56 documentary @entity65 , to be aired tonight			1
' i wanted to raise awareness of @entity11 , ' miss @entity4 said			1
' obviously in our community everybody knows about it because of me , but it ’s not as well known as some other conditions			1
' with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ( @entity11 ) , bone begins to form in a person 's muscles , tendons , ligaments and other connective tissues			1
bone also forms over joints , which become literally ‘ frozen ' in place			1
over time movement becomes more and more restricted			2
@entity11 is usually caused by a genetic mutation ( change ) that happens by chance			1
the first sign that a child might have @entity11 syndrome are two malformed big toes , usually visible at birth			2
@entity11 bone growth tends to go from the top down , starting in the neck and finishing in the feet			1
a child will typically develop bones in their neck , then on their shoulders and arms , in the chest area , and finally their feet			0
unfortunately , there is nothing that can slow or stop the bone formation once it has started			1
source : @entity105 diagnosed at the age of three , it was when she hit puberty that the condition took hold			1
both her arms are locked in place and her spine is frozen			1
she told @entity35 's @entity34 : ' i was walking along the road when i was three years old and fell			1
it was initially thought i 'd dislocated my elbow , but it turned out i had @entity11			0
' but no one has ever treated me any differently and my friends and family are a good support system			0
' but the 19 - year - old ’s illness has not affected her passion for fashion - she buys all the newest products and spends hours practicing techniques and styles , as well as filling her wardrobe with the latest fashions			2
' my mum and granny were always well dressed			0
my mum used to dress us up in the biggest , frilliest dresses ever , and having older sisters i was always into clothes , ' the 19 - year - old said			0
' i just love all of that			0
i would love to either be a stylist or a make - up artist or work for someone like @entity49			0
' she told this morning : ' i just love fashion and how you can adapt different trends to suit your own body shape			0
it makes me happy wearing really beautiful clothes			0
' and she got her dream come true , securing work experience placements at @entity48 and @entity49 , both recorded in the documentary			0
the experiences were came with their own challenges - miss @entity53 has to be accompanied at all times because of her limited mobility and also has to be careful in crowded places , as any bump could cause her body to lay down more excess bone , locking another joint			2
diagnosed at the age of three , it was when @entity4 hit puberty that the condition took hold			1
both her arms are locked in place and her spine is frozen			2
right : aged 12 with her mother @entity173 but she refused to be put off , saying : ' if i start to think about things i would never leave the house			0
' @entity177 , 21 , accompanied her to fashion week where she joined designer @entity179 , helping at hair and make - up trials then checking models ’ hair , make - up and clothes before they hit the catwalk			0
at her placement at @entity49 , her mother @entity173 , 44 , also had to be on hand to help with practicalities like sitting comfortably at her desk			0
miss @entity4 admitted the latter was easier for her because of the chaotic nature of being backstage at fashion week			1
and she said she had been met with a positive reaction from everyone - which is not always the case			0
' people have all sorts of different reactions , ' she said			0
' for some people it can take a lot for them to understand			0
you have to sit and explain it			0
' but all my close family and friends are just like , " you ’re normal , get on with it "			0
there ’s never been , " you ’re different , you ca n’t do this , you ca n’t do that "			2
' she often sticks to the mantra : ' if it does n’t bother me it should n’t bother you ' , and is adamant that @entity11 will not stand in her way			0
despite her condition , the teenager , from @entity33 , insists : ' it 's never going to stop me from doing what i want to do ' ' if i think it ’s fine and i can manage to do it , i will do it , ' she added			1
miss @entity53 now plans to pursue her career however she can from home , including a fashion blog and her own styling and make - up business			0
there are also hopes for a cure for @entity11 after research scientists recently managed to stop it progressing in mice			2
' the last time i heard , any cure could be about three to five years off , ' miss @entity4 added			1
' of course i ’m hopeful but i do n’t get all excited and think it ’s going to happen , because they could say three to five years but it could be longer			1
' but she refuses to fear the future - either the possibility of not living past her 40s , or being locked into one position			2
' it does n’t actually scare me because i do n’t think about it			0
if it happens , it happens , and if they find a cure then that will be amazing			0
' the @entity65 will air on @entity56 tonight at 9pm .			0
