they felt @entity47 was a part of their lives , but everybody has a secret life			0

' my sons are @entity58 , and they believe everyone should be free as part of humanity			2

let me make that trip			0
it 's not that dangerous			0
" ' he said to me , " @entity92 , i feel guilty			0
i have food , i have everything here - do n't be upset with me			0
this is the best opportunity for me			0

maybe he thought he could get his brothers back , i do n't know			0

if one part complains , the other parts react , so i do n't see it as a @entity3 conflict			2
