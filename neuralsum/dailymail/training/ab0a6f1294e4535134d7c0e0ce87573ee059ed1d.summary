by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 07:16 est , 6 january 2014 doctors are concerned that data harvested from patients by the government will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients doctors are rebelling against plans to harvest personal information from the medical files of millions of patients			1
from spring , officials will begin building a giant database they say will help them identify poor performance such as long waiting times and late diagnosis of diseases such as cancer			1
they believe the information might even lead to new treatments			2
but there is widespread concern among mps , academics and doctors that the data will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients			1
@entity34 , which is overseeing the scheme , says privacy will be ensured because only dates of birth , postcodes and @entity34 numbers will be stored			1
but each year more than a million medical files go missing from the @entity42 – many of them lost on public transport or dumped in bins			2
unless patients tell their gp in person or over the phone that they do not want to be involved in the scheme , their data will be harvested automatically			1
critics say the @entity34 is making it deliberately difficult for patients to opt out – given how hard it is to make an appointment with a doctor or even speak to them on the phone			1
at least two gps are so opposed to the scheme they have removed the thousands of patients on their books from it unless they have specifically asked to be included			0
one of the doctors , who is based in @entity64 and is remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals , said he believed the scheme breached data protection laws			1
starting today , the @entity34 will begin dropping leaflets through the doors of all households explaining the scheme			1
it is not clear whether patients will have to see their gp in person or call the surgery - it will vary between practices			0
there is also concern most of the public will never read them because they will be lost among junk mail			0
@entity85 , a @entity87 mp and former shadow home secretary , said : ' it 's an enormous threat to privacy			1
to make patients go in and make an appointment with their gp is frankly disgraceful			0
' the database does have huge value for the @entity34 but it will go wrong			1
some people 's information will be lost			0
if hackers can take on @entity98 , how long until they get to the @entity99 ? ' @entity100 , a @entity87 mp and @entity76 who sits on the @entity101 , said : there 's no doubt that sharing records is good for patient care			1
but ultimately patients own their medical records and they should decide who they share them with			0
@entity87 mp and former shadow home secretary @entity85 said : ' it 's an enormous threat to privacy			1
' ' there are some people who might want to access it , not for the best reasons , for example insurance companies			0
' there is concern that officials will use the data to make cuts to @entity34 services where they are n't deemed to be needed – such as diabetes clinics in areas where the disease is less common			1
campaigners say drug firms could even use the data to raise premiums for at - risk groups			1
@entity131 , who specialises in information security at @entity133 , accused @entity42 officials of deliberate deception			2
he said : ' the @entity34 takes the view that it 's our information , we 'll do with it what we want			1
there is no effort to maintain patients ' privacy			2
' the professor said it would be very easy for researchers , drugs firms or insurers to identify patients just by knowing their postcode and date of birth alone			0
ultimately , he said it could lead to highly personal information about patients ' illnesses or conditions appearing on the internet or in research papers			0
@entity159 , of the campaign group @entity161 , said the scheme was cynical and irresponsible			0
but dr @entity163 , who is chief data officer at @entity34 , said : ' the @entity34 has been collecting information like this from hospitals for decades but until now we 've been missing information about the quality of care provided outside hospital			1
' this is about upgrading our information systems to get a more complete picture of the quality of care being delivered across all parts of the @entity34 and social care			1
' dr @entity178 warned the database will ' be a honeypot for hackers ' ever since the launch of the @entity34 in 1948 , patients have been able to rely on a principle of confidentiality – they have always been assured that their medical notes are private			1
but now , for the first time , we gps are being told to pass those notes to a third party			0
the records will be mined for data by the @entity194 , but in future that could be passed on to researchers and even drugs firms with commercial profits in mind			2
we are told that all personal data will be in an ‘ anonymous ' form			2
but it will include your postcode and your @entity34 number			1
hardly very anonymous , then			0
you ca n't tell me that this is not a breach of confidentiality			0
if the situation was different and a @entity76 handed over this kind of information to a third party , and the patient found out and complained , the consequences would be severe			0
that complaint would be taken to the @entity218 , and the first thing it would do would be to suspend the gp pending an investigation for a breach of professional ethics			0
yet apparently it 's quite all right for a government body to do this			0
this is really important and the public need to know about it			0
from today @entity34 – which runs the health service – begins posting leaflets through doors explaining how and why this data is being used			1
leaflets are all well and good , but what will people do with those leaflets ? some will simply bin them , mistaking them for junk mail			0
doubtless there will be patients who would n't want their data released but simply wo n't know that it is happening			2
if you tell your gp that you want to opt out , your details will not be released			0
but why should the government decide to release this private information unless you actively take steps to stop it ? surely it should be the other way round – that people should opt in			0
to say that this is the thin end of the wedge is an understatement			0
who 's to say that confidential information you give to your gp might not be used against you in terms of health insurance ? as @entity85 mp rightly says , it will also be a honeypot for hackers			2
there may be benefits that come from researchers being able to look at this data , but we have no reason to trust the government on this			2
after all , it has a particularly poor reputation when it comes to dealing with it systems , and it is perfectly possible this data could be abused – at cataclysmic cost to the patient .			2

from spring , officials will begin building a giant database
but doctors fear that data will fall into the hands of hackers
@entity34 , which is overseeing it , says privacy will be ensured
