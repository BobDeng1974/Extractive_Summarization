by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 is due to arrive in @entity2 on friday with local opposition to his proposed @entity5 stadium on the waterfront gathering momentum			2
@entity1 is likely to attend the @entity8 game against @entity9 on saturday , but his priority is to do the rounds of political , community and youth soccer groups to sell his case to build a venue next to the @entity17 basketball stadium			2
the @entity1 camp are confident the negative public mood will change when they announce their plans in more detail			0
work to do : @entity1 will try and win over public support in @entity2 when he arrives on friday but @entity1 will need all his undoubted charm ahead of a referendum in november to persuade the electorate that his project will be totally privately funded and that all he wants from the state is the same tax relief conditions given to other @entity30 sports franchises plus a fair market price for the land			0
@entity2 voters will be ultra-sceptical after the enormous cost to taxpayers of the @entity37 baseball stadium			0
even the much - needed refurbishments to the @entity40 @entity39 , where @entity8 play today , have been delayed over the cost to the public purse			0
the largesse of @entity45 watchmakers @entity46 is extending beyond their making of a limited edition @entity49 66 watch for the @entity8 manager , their @entity52 ambassador			0
father and son : @entity55 talks to his son @entity56 in @entity2 @entity55 ’s three lieutenants , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , were also presented with their 66 watches by @entity55 ’s son @entity56 , who helped design them , during a barbecue at his home outside @entity2			0
the daily @entity66 video from inside the @entity8 camp featured the presenter taking advantage of @entity70 leaving the door to his hotel room open to surprise him on his return			1
but @entity74 might be upset that in the footage of @entity70 ’s bathroom there was no sign of their product , which he lucratively endorses			1
schoolboy : @entity82 and @entity8 defender @entity66 sneaks in to @entity70 's room axed @entity85 manager @entity84 , who has a holiday home in @entity30 where he decamped after his @entity88 departure , has sufficiently recovered from his bruising sacking to have dinner with media critics in @entity2			1
club @entity8 managing director @entity92 has risen from the @entity94 communications department to the top of the organisation			0
yet @entity92 , who has ambitions of becoming a club chief executive , told fcbusiness magazine he believes there is a reluctance to give senior football positions to those with a pr background compared to a marketing , legal or financial one			2
ambitions : club @entity8 managing director @entity92 would like one day to be a chief executive of a club @entity110 by his absence from a @entity113 media drinks party in @entity2 was the @entity115 football commentator @entity114 , especially as the occasion included a presentation to @entity118 , his colleague of over two decades , who is retiring after the @entity52			1
@entity114 is due to make his own tribute when he hands over the commentary halfway through the first half of the final on july 13			1
@entity126 getting it @entity124 @entity124 and @entity127 have been signed up by @entity128 to improve their panel of pundits for a second season of live @entity133 coverage			1
@entity126 are revamping their saturday schedule for the 2014 - 15 campaign with a new football preview programme looking forward to the weekend ’s fixtures at home and abroad			2
new signing : @entity124 will work for @entity128 next season as a pundit and the lively duo , who should bring more personality to the @entity126 analysts roster , will be involved in that show as well as pundit duties			1
@entity126 are not concerned that @entity124 and @entity127 also have roles with @entity148 and @entity115 , believing networks sharing talent is the future			1
@entity153 personnel attached to the @entity8 party say they are not interested in the written press , preferring social media and not even offering information after the event about a @entity153 casual wear photoshoot with @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 in @entity2			0
yet shamelessly , @entity153 representatives were feeding their faces at a press bash bankrolled by helpful @entity8 sponsors @entity113 .			0

@entity66 's video shows @entity70 is *missing* his @entity168
@entity115 football commentator @entity114 *misses* presentation to colleague @entity118
@entity124 to join @entity128 as a pundit next season
