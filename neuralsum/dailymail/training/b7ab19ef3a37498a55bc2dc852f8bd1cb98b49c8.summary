by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 admitted he had never seen anything like it as @entity4 collapsed to a sensational eight for four on the first morning of the fourth @entity5 in @entity6			1
the @entity7 were eventually skittled for 152 , with a test - record six batsmen making ducks and @entity1 taking six for 25			1
@entity11 closed on 113 for three , having lost @entity12 in the final over of a pulsating day			1
@entity1 , who confirmed he will have an operation on his right knee — either at the end of this series or the one - dayers which follow — said : ‘ it felt like we could get a wicket any ball			1
to have them eight for four — i ca n’t remember when we ’ve knocked over a top order like that			1
but we were n’t lucky when it came to the skills we produced			0
with the nicks carrying , it was a huge advantage for us			0
’ @entity1 and @entity33 — who finished with three for 46 and barely said a word all day after the sledging rumpus ahead of this game — struck twice each as @entity4 lost their first four wickets without adding a run in the space of 13 scarcely believable deliveries			2
‘ when it ’s swinging like that , @entity33 ’s got it on a string both ways			0
he bowled beautifully and looks in great rhythm			0
and lots of his runs came from nicks to third man			2
’ @entity60 : @entity61 , left , and @entity62 , right , leave the pitch after scoring 0 runs for @entity4 @entity66 can still comeback - @entity65 @entity1 has faced speculation all summer about the tendinitis of the patella he has been suffering , and a specialist will arrive from @entity71 at the end of next week ’s final test at @entity74 to determine the precise date of the operation			1
he may be out for anything up to three - and - a - half months , but insisted he would be fit for the @entity78 early next year			2
on thursday , he bowled as if surgery was the last thing on his mind , and sang the praises of the @entity31 pitch			0
‘ it was brilliant to challenge the batsmen on the front foot knowing the nicks would carry , ’ he said			0
bowled : @entity4 batsman @entity88 looks on after he is bowled by @entity1 in the fourth test ‘ the top order did n’t get time to settle , and the bouncer went through pretty well too			1
when we lost the toss , i was a bit disappointed , but it turned out to be a fantastic toss to lose			0
’ @entity65 , one of only three @entity7 to make double figures , said : ‘ i ’m pretty blank at this point in time			0
but if we get some helpful conditions tomorrow and a couple of early wickets , we ’re right back in this game			2
