@entity0 launched a bizarre defence of the @entity3 tax - dodging scandal yesterday , insisting he was not to blame despite having been its prime minister for 18 years			1
the scandal engulfing the new @entity8 president and arch - federalist deepened after a disastrous press conference in which he attempted to claim it was not his fault			2
mr @entity0 told journalists that he was ‘ not the architect of what you could call the @entity3 problem ’			1
‘ there is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in @entity24 , ’ he added			0
ca n't hear your over all my avoidance : @entity0 claims there is no conflict of interest as the @entity8 begins to investigate tax deals between international corporations and @entity3 , deals which were made while he was prime minister but mr @entity0 was either prime minister or finance minister of the country for more than two decades from the mid- 90s			1
@entity37 mp @entity36 said : ‘ i would be surprised if he was in charge of the country and did n’t know what was going on			0
i do n’t know what ’s worse – being in charge and turning a blind eye to aggressive tax avoidance or being in charge and not knowing what ’s going on			0
you would n’t want to have someone in charge of the @entity51 who did n’t know what ’s going on			0
he has got some very serious questions to answer			0
’ it was reported last week that @entity3 had granted secret deals to 340 companies allowing them to avoid tax			1
it helped them avoid paying billions in tax elsewhere and was agreed at the time when mr @entity0 was in charge of the country			1
he said yesterday it was up to the @entity3 government to explain its behaviour			2
bizarrely , he also appeared to blame the problems in @entity3 on @entity67 and other countries in @entity24 blocking tax harmonisation across the continent			1
king of the ' magical fairyland ' : other @entity51 countries may have missed out on billions of euros in tax revenues while @entity3 became one of the world ’s richest because of the sweetheart deals he suggested that tax rates that ‘ can sometimes lack fairness ’ , a problem caused by countries such as the @entity67 not wanting to give up sovereignty over taxation			1
‘ if there is insufficient tax harmonisation in @entity24 then this can be the result , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 admitted that as prime minister he was ‘ politically responsible ’ for what happened in each and every corner of the country ’ , but indicated he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated			1
companies such as @entity98 and @entity99 had their divisions in @entity3 lend money to their operations in other countries			2
the interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries			0
in some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the @entity112			0
reports about the tax breaks surfaced last week , putting @entity0 , who only took office on november 1 , immediately in the firing line given the @entity51 's headline commitment to fighting tax fraud			1
@entity37 mp @entity119 called for mr @entity0 to resign			2
he said : ‘ his position is untenable			0
the issue of corporate tax avoidance has been high on the @entity67 agenda because of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
the sweet heart deals of countries such as @entity3 sit at odds with a @entity8 president who says that he supports widespread economic and financial reform			1
’ spilling the beans : companies such as @entity135 had their divisions in @entity3 lend money to their operations in other countries , leak says @entity140 , @entity141 ’s economics spokesman , said : ‘ the @entity51 actually facilitates tax avoidance by enabling multinational corporations to channel earnings through whichever member state they want			1
‘ @entity3 was happy to do dirty dealings with the big corporations to maximise its revenues at the cost of tens of billions of pounds that should have ended up in the @entity67 public realm			2
‘ @entity0 has lots of questions to answer			2
it ’s why multinationals are so keen on @entity51 membership but why it is not in the @entity67 ’s interest			0
’ @entity159 , chair of the commons public accounts committee , said mr @entity0 had ‘ presided over the biggest exploitation of @entity24 nations in his own little country for decades ’			2
the @entity166 mp , who has been one of the fiercest critics of tax avoidance by companies such as @entity126 , @entity125 and @entity124 , said : ‘ i think he should come clean and talk about it , certainly try to explain it			0
how can we know he ’s working in the interest of @entity24 when as prime minister in @entity3 he has exploited populations in every @entity24 country and elsewhere for decades ? ’ the @entity8 has launched a series of investigations into tax arrangements in @entity181 , the @entity182 and @entity3 on the grounds they might infringe state aid rules by unfairly favouring some companies over others			1
@entity51 competition commissioner @entity188 has promised to press on with the probes and @entity0 earlier said he would let the process take its course , as it should			2
however , questions about his role in deals which are technically legal but go against the grain at a time of austerity , refuse to go away			0
on wednesday , @entity0 turned up at the @entity8 's midday press conference unannounced , only for journalists to question his credibility and suitability as head of the @entity51 's key executive arm			1
' i 'm as suitable as you are , ' @entity0 replied to one journalist			0
@entity0 said that as head of the @entity8 he could no longer comment on @entity3 's affairs			1
some 22 of the 28 @entity51 states had similar tax arrangements , he said , and the issue was to ensure that they did not violate state aid rules .			0

@entity3 did tax break deals with more than *300* global firms
the claims are now being investigated by the @entity8
they were signed while @entity0 was prime minister of @entity3
he now heads @entity8 , but claims there is no conflict of interest
