posing with her hand on her swollen stomach , @entity0 joked about being nine months pregnant			1
but the 53 - year - old 's smile masked her concern			2
she had been through the menopause , and was suffering pains in her stomach			2
concerned , mrs @entity0 , from @entity9 in the @entity10 , visited her doctor , and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity13 )			1
but when medication , cutting out wheat and dairy from her diet , and colonic irrigation failed to ease her symptoms , she returned to see another doctor			1
@entity0 , 53 , became concerned last year when her stomach began to bloat and she suffered pains			1
after visiting her doctor she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity13 )			1
but after months of trying various treatments her stomach started to get bigger and bigger mrs @entity0 was referred to see a specialist , who performed an ultrasound			1
it revealed a giant cyst in her womb			1
while performing a full hysterectomy , surgeons removed a growth the size of a rugby ball			1
it was at a follow - up appointment that specialists told mrs @entity0 the mass had been cancerous , diagnosing her with a rare but life - threatening fallopian tube cancer			1
mrs @entity0 , told @entity39 : ' i 'd gone through the menopause a few years before and thought i was done with all the bloating and discomfort			1
then i started getting pains in my tummy			2
' visiting her doctor in january 2013 , company director mrs @entity0 was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome , a common digestive complaint			1
looking up solutions online , she did all she could to help curb the distressing symptoms ; cutting out wheat and dairy and taking medication to settle her belly			1
she even tried colonic irrigation , which seemed to soothe her symptoms			1
however , after about a month of respite , they returned with vengeance			0
' my stomach was just getting bigger and bigger , ' the mother - of - one said			2
' i tried to laugh it off			0
' i even posed for a picture with my hand on my belly as if i was pregnant			2
' though i was worried and returned for another colonic as that had helped before			0
' during the session , the nurse suggested mrs @entity0 's swollen stomach could be down to a cyst			1
it prompted her to get a crucial second opinion			0
the second doctor was much more concerned at the sight of her terribly swollen belly , immediately referring her to a specialist at the @entity78 in @entity79			2
an ultrasound revealed an ovarian cyst and mrs @entity0 was advised to have a full hysterectomy			1
while waiting for surgery , her tummy continued to balloon			0
' by then , i looked nine months pregnant , ' she said			0
' i felt like i was pregnant , i walked like i was pregnant			0
i could n't touch my toes and had to sit down to put my shoes on			0
the pain was excruciating too			0
painkillers did n't touch the sides			0
' one morning , i woke up and the agony was worse than giving birth			0
it took me 10 minutes to get down one stair			0
' following her operation , doctors told the 53 - year - old the cyst had been the size of a rugby ball			1
' there was no indication at all that the cyst was anything to worry about and , though a hysterectomy is a big operation , it was n't like i could 've had anymore kids anyway , ' she told @entity39			2
' i was left with an 11 - inch scar and 40 metal staples holding it together			0
mrs @entity0 , pictured before treatment left , and afterwards , right , sought a second opinion and was referred to a specialist			1
an ultrasound revealed a huge mass in her womb			1
surgeons removed the cyst but tests revealed the lump was cancerous , diagnosing the 53 - year - old with a rare fallopian tube cancer fallopian tube cancer is a rare form of the disease			1
the fallopian tubes link the ovaries to the womb , carrying eggs from the to the womb			0
only around one in 100 cancers of the female reproductive system are fallopian tube cancer			1
however many experts believe most high grade serious type ovarian cancers actually start in the far end of the fallopian tube , rather than on the surface of the ovary			1
it is most common in post-menopausal women			0
symptoms include : scientists do not know what causes fallopian tube cancer , but if two or more of your very close relatives - your mother , sister or daughter - have had ovarian cancer , your risk may be increased			1
two genes have been linked to causing ovarian and fallopian tube cancer			1
they are the @entity161 genes			0
researchers believe the faulty brca gene may cause around 16 in 100 cancers or the fallopian tube			2
the disease can be hard to diagnose , but doctors will routinely perform pelvic examinations , scans and blood tests			2
as with ovarian cancer , surgeons will try to remove as much of the tumour as possible			2
chemotherapy is often used after surgery to try and stop the cancer from returning			2
source : @entity178 ' but i just went home and tried to get on with my life , glad to be back in my normal clothes again without that swelling			0
' but weeks on , during a check - up , doctors revealed that they had tested tissue taken from mrs @entity0 and discovered she had an incredibly rare fallopian tube cancer			1
she was then put through six sessions of chemotherapy last june to make sure the cancer did not return			2
' i just got on with it and insisted on working all the way through my treatment , ' she said			0
' the worst bit for me was losing my long blonde hair			0
i 'd read about the symptoms i could expect but nothing prepares you for seeing your hair coming out in clumps			0
' it 's one of the most devastating things a woman can go through			0
i lost my lashes and brows , too			0
i found myself a wig but thought there was nothing i could do about my facial hair			0
' to her relief , mrs @entity0 discovered that she could have her eyebrows tattooed on , as well as semi-permanent eyeliner			1
' it helped to shape my face and made me feel so much more confident , ' she said			0
' i wish more women knew about it			0
just make sure you have it done before you start chemo in case of infection			0
' mrs @entity0 is now in remission and attends the hospital for regular check - ups			1
' people need to know that @entity13 symptoms can be the same as cancer and to make sure they do n't get fobbed off by doctors , ' she told @entity39			1
' i used to giggle about my baby bump but my little joke could have killed me			0
looking back now , it 's awful to think there was such a huge ticking time bomb inside me			0
' if the cyst had n't grown , i would 've continued to think i had @entity13 and i would n't be here today			2
