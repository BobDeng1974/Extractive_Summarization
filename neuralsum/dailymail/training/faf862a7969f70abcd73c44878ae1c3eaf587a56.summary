last week , the return of @entity1 for its 50th anniversary was , for me , all about what it was going to be in the future			1
this week , on the actual weekend anniversary , it was a little more to do with its glorious past			1
and you have to say , the manner in which they did it , was a nice touch			2
but asking him to commentate on a team who play ‘ 19th century football ’ ( copyright , @entity45 ) ? bit harsh			0
luckily for @entity15 , though , the @entity19 had forsaken their hobnail boots for shooting ones			1
as a result he had one of the best games in the division on saturday , into which he could skillfully weave his colours and textures			0
to make @entity15 feel perfectly back at home , the commemorative title sequence features one of his most celebrated moments			1
‘ look at his face			0
just look at his face ’ implores mr @entity15 as the cherubic chops of @entity61 glow in the wake of a @entity64 goal			1
yes kids , those are pictures of a former top flight centre forward in @entity71 ! retro : @entity1 embraced a seventies theme for 50th anniversary of first edition moonlighting : @entity76 has been working with both the @entity77 and @entity78 what ’s more , this week they even threw in a few clips of @entity22 ’s forebears			1
amongst them , @entity84 and @entity85 showing the @entity86 how it ’s done in the wardrobe department , with their sporty short - sleeved shirts			1
the picture was then completed on the match coverage itself			0
as we saw the match commentator weave his way to the commentary box , @entity22 reminded us it was 45 - years ago at @entity20 where @entity15 had made his @entity1 debut			1
and we got the graphics such a return demanded			2
big ones ! @entity103 ! ! in the second half , when @entity33 made a double substitution , you had to peer past the letters to see the action			0
as for mr @entity15 being back at the helm is concerned , it really was a welcome return			1
the voice may not have the punch it once did , but it was still laden with all the right moves			0
his immediate reaction to @entity19 ’s exquisitely volleyed opener was an almost operatic chant of ‘ oh , @entity117 ’			0
while for their second , @entity15 absolutely called it as he suggested out loud that @entity122 ‘ could have a crack here ? ’			1
clearly @entity15 still has a youthful enthusiasm for the game			1
and when he declared at the final whistle it had been an ‘ entertaining afternoon ’ , i ’m sure he meant both for himself , and for those watching a fine game of football			2
stylish : @entity33 coach @entity131 ( front left ) fitted in with his splendid mullet although i wonder if he thinks there are some things that ai n’t what they used to be , but perhaps should ? i ’m not totally convinced he was all that impressed when he noted @entity140 was on the bench in the ‘ tie undone style ’			2
sort it out , @entity140 ! so a more than welcome reprise for one of the great voices of sport			0
on a show that also welcomed back to the pundit ’s chair the newly bequiffed @entity76			2
which i must admit , left me pondering somewhat			0
impressed : viewers took to @entity154 to praise @entity1 's retro graphics perhaps i just do n’t understand the transfer market for football experts ? only a couple of weeks ago , @entity76 was announced as a major new signing for @entity78			2
and indeed he has already been turning out for them on his new saturday morning show ‘ @entity161 ’			0
but clearly the loan system in the telly world means you can play for two teams at the same time			0
now for me , i ’d be wishing my old player the best of luck with his new challenge and look to bring in some fresh new talent who ’d be proud to pull on just the one shirt			0
but perhaps like @entity15 , i ’m from a different age ? and although it may have come as a bit of a surprise to me , as @entity176 sang at the start of this particularly vintage edition of @entity1 , it ’s not unusual .			1

@entity15 , aged 76 , was brought back for one - off appearance
special 50th anniversary edition featured seventies style graphics
@entity15 ' youthful enthusiasm for the game still *remains*
