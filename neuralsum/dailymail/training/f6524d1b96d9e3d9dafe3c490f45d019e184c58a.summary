as summer gives way to autumn and winter , sightings of the creatures inside people 's homes have increased over the last month			2
telling of her encounter with the spider , mother - of - one @entity43 said : ' i thought the spider might pounce on anything moving - it looked pretty menacing			0
' so to lure it out , i thought i 'd feed it a crane fly near its nest to see what would happen			0
as you can see , the spider popped straight out , dragging the prey back into its nest			2
' i must admit it was actually much bigger than i thought it would be - previous to this you could only really see its front legs and head as it sat at the entrance to its nest			0
' after talking to my friend - who 's a spider expert - i found out it is more than likely that there are more of them about			0
' they tend to stay in their nest and you can only see them sitting at the entrance at night so i doubt a lot of people would even notice them if they were outside			0
' she says she was shocked by the size of the creature , which she could only initially see lurking in its hole ms @entity6 discovered the creature after an identical spider , which she believes is another on lurking in her home , landed on her shoulder as she walked into her garage with her two - year - old daughter			1
after eventually capturing it , she said : ' i considered trying to get the spider back in its nest , i thought i had better put it out at the end of the garden			1
' i admit that after i released it i ran away in case it chased me because it looked pretty angry when it was trapped in the wine glass			0
' it is the latest sighting of one of the spiders in @entity3 , which are believed to have moved to @entity3 from southern @entity102 due to the warmer weather			1
@entity104 is the largest @entity102 spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm			0
originally from the @entity109 , they can be found as far east as @entity110 but are also commonly spotted in @entity3 - particularly in the later half of the year			2
they have a black or dark brown body , often with a green shine on their fangs			0
while their bite has no long lasting effects , it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours			0
they are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it			2
sightings of the spider in @entity3 have in the past been confused with the deadly @entity136 funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique .			1
