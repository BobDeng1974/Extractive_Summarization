to appreciate society ’s preoccupation with whiter teeth , one need look no further than our bathroom cabinets			1
from electric toothbrushes and whitening toothpastes to home - bleaching kits and flossers , perfecting our smiles puts a rather large dent in our pockets			1
but at around £ 600 professional whitening treatments are a luxury few can afford			1
the three - step @entity30 comprises two serums — liquids in small pots with integrated brushes , rather like nail varnishes — and a toothpaste			1
paint on the brightener serum and leave it on the teeth for 30 seconds , before brushing the activator serum over the top and leaving for another 30 seconds			2
rinse thoroughly with cold water , then wait 20 minutes , before brushing for two minutes with the special toothpaste			2
there are no trays to sleep in , no fiddly strips , and no sitting under a laser with a rictus grin			2
so , how does it work ? ‘ there are two types of dental discolouration , ’ says cosmetic dentist and @entity30 consultant dr @entity54			1
‘ these are extrinsic staining on the surface of the tooth , which can be polished off , and intrinsic staining , where the stain has actually been absorbed into the tooth and is more difficult to remove			2
’ perfect smile : @entity66 drops @entity30 to get rid of intrinsic staining , you need to bleach the tooth			1
during this process , the bleaching agent , which penetrates the surface of the tooth , reacts with the stain , making it transparent			2
the result is whiter teeth			0
but what makes this new product better than other home - whitening treatments ? professional whitening treatments tend to use the chemicals hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as bleaching agents			1
but , in the @entity83 , these ca n’t be sold over-the - counter in concentrations that will really make a difference			0
@entity30 is using another bleaching agent — chlorine dioxide , more commonly used for purifying water — which works in the same way , and is found in some mouthwashes			1
the chlorine dioxide is produced when the activator serum is applied on top of the brightener serum , and remains active for about ten minutes			0
this breaks down the absorbed stains , while the special toothpaste helps remove the surface stains			0
@entity30 suggest repeating the process once a day for ten days for best results			1
it all sounds impressive , but does it really work ? @entity101 , 50 , a manager in the publishing industry from @entity103 , tried the new product for ten days			0
‘ i had a brace as a child , so my teeth have always been one of my better qualities , ’ she says			0
an average person spends 38.5 days brushing their teeth over a lifetime ‘ but although i do n’t drink red wine or smoke , because of my coffee habit — two to three strong cups a day — my teeth are not as white as i would like them to be			0
‘ ten years ago , i had them professionally whitened and was really pleased with the results			1
but i have n’t been able to justify that sort of money since , and i ’ve been wary of going somewhere cheap as you hear horror stories about your teeth being left feeling very sensitive			0
so how did she find the new @entity30 product in comparison ? ‘ the instructions were easy to follow and the results after ten days were amazing , ’ she says			1
‘ according to the chart on the box , my teeth went from shade 11 to shade four , and i did n’t notice any more sensitivity			0
‘ i think the improvement in colour is as good as when i had them done professionally			0
’ dr @entity137 adds : ‘ leaving it on for longer , or using it more than once a day , wo n’t make your teeth whiter , or speed up the process			0
‘ there ’s a maximum amount of oxidation that can happen within any 24 - hour period			0
’ get a @entity19 smile without visiting the dentist : professional teeth - whitening costs £ 600 ( posed by model ) but one dentist we spoke to is wary about this new home bleaching treatment			1
‘ using the product for longer than the recommended time might damage the enamel of the teeth , ’ says dr @entity154 , clinical director of the @entity155			0
‘ in the past , a lot of beauty salons offered cheap whitening treatments that used chlorine dioxide			1
it ’s an effective whitening agent , but it is also very acidic			2
’ she adds : ‘ patients were initially delighted with the results , but soon found that , as the protective enamel had been worn away , teeth stained more easily , leaving them darker and more sensitive			2
‘ thirty seconds may not be long enough to cause the damage but , without published data showing long - term effects , i ’d be wary			0
’ nevertheless , @entity173 , from @entity30 , insists there is no cause for concern : ‘ the ph of chlorine dioxide is around the same as orange juice , which means having it in contact with your teeth for 30 seconds and then rinsing it off does no more harm than drinking a glass of juice every morning			1
