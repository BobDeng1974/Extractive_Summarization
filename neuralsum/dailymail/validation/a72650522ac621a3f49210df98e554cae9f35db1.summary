@entity0 will leave a @entity1 they can hardly be said to have graced having at least avoided another catastrophe in their final pretty meaningless match			1
when you have been as desperate as @entity0 in this tournament any win is a good one so they will be relieved to have avoided what would have been the most embarrassing defeat of them all			1
a gloomy , miserable @entity12 day matched the mood and turned this dead rubber into a damp one , with @entity0 winning a truncated contest with ease			0
@entity17 plays a shot as @entity0 cruise to victory against @entity21 in their final match of the @entity24 @entity17 acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half - century towards the end of the match in @entity12 @entity17 ( right ) and @entity28 leave the field after securing a second victory for @entity0 at the @entity1 @entity0 coach @entity31 is pictured following the conclusion of the match at the @entity34 @entity21 's @entity35 ( right ) appeals unsuccessfully as @entity0 go on to claim victory @entity0 bowler @entity37 ( right ) is presented with the @entity38 after posting figures of 2 - 13 it will mean little to them but at least @entity0 avoided statistically their worst @entity1 of all , their victories over @entity43 and now @entity21 matching their miserly returns of 1996 when they could defeat just @entity45 and the @entity46			1
this , though , feels much worse			0
the statistics , if we can dare mention them , will say that @entity21 could only manage 111 for seven in the 36.2 overs that the weather allowed them before the third of three rain breaks brought their innings to a premature close			2
then @entity0 , set 101 to win in 25 overs by @entity59 , cruised home while losing just one wicket with 41 balls in hand , helped by a quite shocking fielding performance from @entity21			1
@entity65 was dropped twice , both by @entity66 off the bowling of @entity68 , but showed the hitting he is capable of in reaching 37 before @entity21 finally held on to a chance			0
and @entity17 , playing in his 161st and surely his last one - day international for @entity0 with a new era about to dawn , signed off with an unbeaten 52			1
a general view of the @entity34 during a rain delay as dark clouds gather above the stadium @entity0 captain @entity77 ( second left ) walks off with @entity17 as rain falls in @entity12 on friday groundsmen cover the pitch as the rain comes down on a wet afternoon in the @entity83 city a steward stands in the rain as play is delayed due to the damp conditions in @entity12 @entity21 's @entity88 ( left ) plays a shot into the leg side on his way to scoring 17 runs @entity93 is out as @entity0 fielder @entity94 takes a successful catch to dismiss the @entity21 batsman now @entity0 will slink off home on saturday with much to contemplate if they are ever to have a chance of catching up with the big - hitters of this tournament who have simply left them behind in 50 - over cricket			1
what cricket there was on friday went @entity0 ’s way , as it should against a team who have only been playing official cricket for the last 14 years			0
@entity0 had little to gain in their final group game and even more to lose against an @entity21 team who have proved themselves here to be more than capable of causing some anxious moments for the established teams			2
but @entity21 struggled against the moving ball and under leaden @entity12 skies after @entity77 had won an important toss in what might be the last game of his short reign as @entity0 ’s one - day captain			1
@entity77 is one of a number of senior @entity0 players who will have to wait and see whether they have a future in limited - overs cricket if the selectors take their only feasible option of starting from scratch with a new , young team			0
two others who may be told to just concentrate on @entity131 in future are the established opening bowling pair of @entity134 and @entity135 but both proved more than a handful for the inexperienced @entity21 batsmen			0
@entity135 ( second right ) celebrates with his @entity0 team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity142 @entity17 dives to his left to field a ball during @entity21 's opening innings on friday afternoon @entity21 's @entity88 ( left ) walks off the field as @entity94 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity0 team - mate @entity28 ( right ) @entity0 's @entity148 ( left ) attempts to run out @entity66 but the @entity21 batsman was safe neither @entity134 nor @entity135 have been at their best here , one of the many reasons why @entity0 have struggled , but at least they will be pleased with how they finished , both picking up a wicket and conceding just 18 runs each			1
@entity0 were without the injured pair of @entity156 and @entity157 and the men who stood in for them could also be satisfied with their work			0
the decision to leave out @entity94 on the eve of the tournament to replace him with @entity163 is one of many to backfire on @entity0 and here he showed that he is more than capable of doing a decent job in the field			0
@entity94 picked up two wickets and took an outstanding catch in the deep to give himself something to remember if he too is playing his last @entity0 game			0
@entity148 has suffered because of the rise of @entity172 as an off - spinner but he was as steady as ever here while the pick of the @entity0 bowlers was @entity37 , something for them to cling to as they ponder the future			2
the @entity1 , which has confirmed that 50 - over cricket is very much alive and kicking in the @entity181 era , will now go on without @entity0 and the sad truth is that they will not be missed at all			2
they have to start all over again now			0
@entity93 ( centre ) and @entity88 ( left ) take a drinks break during the pool a match in @entity12 @entity21 fans show their support with flags and banners in the stands of the @entity34 @entity0 fans dress up for their country 's final match at this year 's @entity1 on friday			1

@entity0 won by nine wickets on the @entity59 after *comfortably* reaching a target of 101
@entity17 was @entity0 's top scorer as he finished on 52 not out , while @entity37 took 2 for 13
the match at the @entity34 was *affected* by a number of rain delays
@entity0 were *knocked* out of the @entity1 earlier this week after defeat by @entity205
friday 's win against @entity21 is just @entity0 's second win of the competition
