by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 17:33 est , 30 april 2012 former @entity2 prime minister @entity1 is accused of abuse of office and paying 17 - year - old prostitute for sex @entity1 told girls coming to his house for a bunga bunga party that he wanted a ' calmer evening ' as the night before he had been he had been ' mad for it			1
' the former @entity2 prime minister , 75 , was taped as he spoke to @entity12 , 31 , and @entity13 , 22 , after they telephoned him and asked if they could ' come and visit him tonight ' with two other women			1
the conversations form part of more than 50,000 calls that were taped by prosecutors as part of the ongoing bunga bunga trial in which the politician is accused of paying a minor for sex			1
it was posted on the website of @entity2 newspaper @entity28 and opens with @entity13 talking to @entity1 and calling him in a cooing voice ' my little puppy , ' before asking if she had disturbed him , with @entity1 telling her : ' i had some important meetings but i have dealt with them			1
how can i help you			0
' after some small talk she passes the receiver to @entity12 who says : ' hi - did you get the message yesterday that i could n't make it ? ' to which @entity1 answers jokingly : ' yes - they told me you did n't give a f * * * about me and that you had other more important and interesting things to do , more sexually exciting			1
' @entity12 then adds laughing that she will be coming along that evening to @entity1 's home with the girls including sultry @entity49 beauty queen @entity48 , 29 , the former girlfriend of singer @entity51			0
@entity1 is heard saying : ' tell @entity52 though that tonight wo n't be anything special - last night we were all mad for it			1
so tonight we will have a tranquil dinner and listen to some music , i do n't want to be the main player			0
' prosecutors say that in total 33 women were regular guests at the parties @entity1 threw at his villa in @entity65 near @entity66 between september 2010 and may 2011 and they were paid with cash , jewellery and cars			0
witnesses have told the hearing in @entity66 that women dressed as nuns or wore @entity66 football shirts , before performing sultry stripteases and pole dances for @entity1 as he looked on in the basement of the villa			0
the charges against @entity1 relate to @entity80 , nicknamed @entity81 , who was 17 at the time of the alleged offences among those who attended was belly dancer @entity85 , who also goes by the name @entity81 the @entity87 and who was just 17 at the time and therefore a minor			2
in @entity2 the legal age of consent is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor , although both she and @entity1 insist that nothing untoward happened			1
the conversation with @entity12 would also appear to be at odds with another defence made by @entity1 , who quit as prime minister in november last year , that ' 33 girls is too many for any man '			2
in an interview last year when the allegations first surfaced he said : ' ... even though i am a bit of a mischievous ... 33 girls in two months is too many , even for a thirty year old			2
it 's too many for anybody			0
' while in another conversation @entity1 tells @entity12 that @entity13 is ' naughty , naughty naughty ' before she passes the telephone to @entity13 who tells @entity1 that he is the ' very , very , very naughty one '			0
he then says : ' i am in a very tough war but when i win it i will take advantage of your sweet beautiful lips			0
' the bunga bunga trial is due to resume on may 7 friday			0
the age of consent in @entity2 is 14 but paying a woman under 18 is seen as child prostitution and besides this allegation @entity1 is also accused of abuse of office with prosecutors claiming he tried to cover up for miss @entity85 when she was arrested on a theft charge			1
he is said to have knowingly and wrongly told police in @entity66 two years ago , that the teenager was related to the then @entity133 president @entity132 and should be freed so as to avoid a diplomatic incident			0
the sex charge carries a maximum sentence of three years while abuse of office is punishable with 12 years in jail			1
the trial started last year and is not expected to finish until 2013 at the earliest with hundreds of witnesses due to testify including @entity141 and @entity142 .			2
