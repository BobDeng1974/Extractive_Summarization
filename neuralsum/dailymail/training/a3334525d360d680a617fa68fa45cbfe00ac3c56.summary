a man who spent more than two decades on @entity2 's death row has walked free into the arms of his family after a judge ruled a confession he gave while high on drugs could no longer be relied upon by prosecutors			1
@entity9 , 42 , walked out of the maximum - security prison in @entity11 to the delight of his mother @entity13 , on friday , 24 years to the day after he was taken into custody following the 1991 killing of a liquor store clerk near @entity17			1
but his reprieve may only be temporary after @entity20 judge @entity19 's ruling his confession should be suppressed			0
@entity9 ( right ) with his mother , @entity22 , in @entity17 after his release from prison this is because prosecutors who moved last week to dismiss the charges against @entity9 following that ruling will now appeal against it to the @entity30 with a view to refiling charges against @entity9 should they be successful			1
nevertheless one of @entity9 's defence attorneys @entity35 said of his release : ' it was an emotional reunion with his family			2
it was quite a day			0
' he and his mom embraced , he walked out the door , said " thank you " to the guards , put his stuff in the car and we drove off			0
' before @entity46 initially overturned @entity9 's conviction and death sentence in a 2012 ruling , which was subsequently reversed by the state @entity30 , @entity9 had spent more time on death row than any other @entity2 inmate currently facing execution			1
he was sentenced to death for the murder of @entity56 , 66 , at the @entity58 liquor store and bar outside @entity17 on january 14 , 1991			1
in overturning @entity9 's conviction and death sentence , @entity46 ruled in 2012 that a confession @entity9 gave to police during an interrogation lasting nearly 13 hours was defective because he had not been properly advised of his miranda rights against self - incrimination and to have an attorney appointed for him			2
the confession was a linchpin for prosecutors at @entity9 's 1992 murder trial , and @entity72 has said it 's unlikely that prosecutors would proceed with the case without the confession			2
@entity9 was convicted of the murder of @entity56 , 66 , at the @entity58 liquor store and bar outside @entity17 on january 14 , 1991 ' the police extracted mr. @entity9 's confession after 13 hours of interrogation in a windowless 13 x 10 room while handcuffed to a table , ' @entity35 said in a written statement on friday			1
' mr @entity9 , who was 18 at the time , was under the influence of heroin and , as the @entity20 found , behaved bizarrely , a fact ignored by his interrogators			0
' the result was a so - called confession that was factually inconsistent with the physical evidence and eyewitness accounts , and found wholly unreliable by the court			0
' @entity46 also ruled in 2012 that @entity9 's case was prejudiced by the failure of the chief investigating officer to advise prosecutors , and thereby defence attorneys , of an attempted robbery at @entity101 , less than two miles from the @entity58 , about half an hour before @entity56 was killed			1
@entity9 's attorneys have argued that such evidence might have exonerated him			0
the @entity30 will decide whether the ruling to suppress @entity9 's confession should stand ' the evidence of this close in time and proximity robbery supports a reasonable inference that the [ @entity101 ] perpetrators were also the @entity58 perpetrators , and thus that @entity9 was not involved in either crime , ' justice @entity105 wrote in a dissenting opinion when the state @entity30 reinstated @entity9 's conviction in 2013			1
following yet another appeal on issues defence attorneys said were left unresolved in its earlier decision , the @entity30 sent the case back to @entity46 , ruling unanimously last year that @entity9 was entitled to a new trial because prosecutors repeatedly withheld potentially exculpatory evidence			0
' the admissibility of @entity9 's confession was fully litigated before the @entity20 in 1992 , and in the @entity30 in 1993 , ' said deputy attorney general @entity72			2
' now , we will ask the @entity30 to finally resolve the issue			0

@entity9 , 42 , walked free into his mother @entity13 ' arms on friday
release came 24 years to the day of his arrest over @entity2 killing
@entity9 was convicted of murdering @entity56 , 66 , at a liquor store
clerk was killed at the @entity58 outside @entity17 in january 1991
judge has ruled @entity9 's drug - *addled* confession should be suppressed
he may end up back on death row if ruling is *quashed* by @entity30
