however , his new owners ' pride soon turned to shock after he began hurling swear words at them - in a @entity12 accent			1
@entity13 , 34 , was thrilled when she brought @entity14 back to her house in @entity16 and he greeted her with a polite ' hello '			2
that was where the niceties ended , however , as the bird began chirruping a string of expletives before telling her , ' i 'm in the @entity26			1
' @entity13 and @entity27 were left stunned when @entity28 began swearing at them in a @entity12 accent just hours after arriving at their home in @entity16 the care worker said : ' it was quite shocking the first time he did it			1
i did n’t quite believe my ears			0
he settled in so quickly and was obviously making himself at home			0
‘ his accent is so strong sometimes that we are n’t sure what he is saying , but it definitely sounds @entity12			0
and when he says the swear words , that is in a distinctive @entity12 accent			1
’ @entity14 had previously lived in the @entity26 of @entity46 , and his owners had admitted to mrs @entity13 that he had picked up some colourful language			1
proud @entity49 : basil the parrot remained true to his @entity12 roots by declaring to his new owners : ' i 'm in the @entity26 ' the mother - of - three adds : ' his previous owners had said he had sworn in the past , but i thought that a change of scenery would leave that behind - not a chance			1
' the parrot , originally native to the rainforests of @entity63 and @entity64 , then caused @entity13 and her husband @entity27 , 39 , even more trouble when he escaped out of a window while they were cleaning his cage			1
after launching a missing poster campaign , the couple found @entity14 safe and well three days later at a nearby vets , where he had a new target for his foul - mouthed rants			1
@entity74 , veterinary manager at the @entity76 @entity75 , said : ‘ he kept calling the nurses t * * * * * s and there were a few other phrases he used that i wo n’t repeat			0
the bolshy bird caused more trouble for his new owners after escaping			2
he turned up at a nearby vets , where he had also targeted nurses with his foul mouth ‘ he was very quiet and shy for the first day , but then all of a sudden he started talking and rather surprised us with his adult vocabulary			1
‘ he also whistled the @entity90 tune and he danced for us when we asked him to , so we forgave his bad manners			0
’ despite the nurses eventually coming round to @entity14 's lewd ways , mrs @entity13 admits the debacle left her red - faced			2
she adds : ' i had to apologise for his bad manners when i collected him			0
it seems that when he is being left on his own away from humans he gets quite angry and swears even more			0
‘ he does n’t like to be ignored , especially if you are eating something he likes , like chocolate			0
he just says ‘ chocolate , chocolate , chocolate ’ over and over until you give him some			0
‘ he gets quite upset if you say no. he really can be a diva			0
