with less than a week before @entity1 starts on march 29 , @entity0 has kicked off in earnest			1
do you want to present perfectly primped limbs to the world when the weather heats up and opaque tights and cardies are cast aside ? then you need to get to work			1
here , we test the latest beauty gadgets and creams and give them a @entity0 ( @entity0 ) rating			1
‘ going two or three shades lighter will keep hair looking natural , but fresh for spring , ’ says @entity25 , @entity27 ’s colourist at @entity29 salon in @entity30			1
‘ or you can freshen up your existing dye job with an at - home mask			1
’ solution : i decide to lighten my five - week - old highlights with @entity38 ( £ 16.99 , @entity39 , launches on monday )			1
@entity40 ( £ 16.99 , sallyexpress.com ) this fruity - smelling non-permanent hair mask promises to revitalise dyed hair using temporary pigments			1
i do a strand test first , then , reassured , squeeze a little orange - gold liquid into my hand and massage into wet hair			1
to my relief , my highlights do , indeed , look a couple of shades lighter and my hair is glossy and groomed			1
@entity0 rating : 7/10 regain your glow @entity21 : ‘ the beginning of spring needs to signal the end of lacklustre skin , ’ says dr @entity57 , cosmetic doctor at @entity58			1
‘ months of cold weather and central heating have taken their toll			1
the top layer of your skin is full of dead cells			1
@entity69 is a great way to get rid of dead cells and dirt			1
’ @entity73 ( £ 150 , harrods.com ) solution : the @entity73 ( £ 150 , harrods.com ) is a hand - held gadget for at - home microdermabrasion			1
it looks like an electric toothbrush , but at the end is a clear plastic lid with a hole at the top			1
under this is a small , flat head covered in fine aluminium oxide crystals			1
read the instructions carefully — this could damage your skin if used incorrectly			1
@entity90 ( £ 79 , epionce.co.uk ) i choose a medium - strength head and turn it on , running the end of the nozzle up the back of my hand			1
there is a faint tingling			1
i try it on my face , holding the skin taut and running it carefully and slowly up my cheeks and chin			1
when i ’ve finished i look much brighter , my fine lines are reduced and my skin is clear and glowing			1
i ’m impressed with the results around my nostrils , which had lots of blocked pores			1
expensive , but seriously effective			1
i follow this with celebrity favourite , @entity90 ( £ 79 , epionce.co.uk ) , for hydration			2
@entity0 rating : 9/10 @entity115 @entity21 : ‘ @entity116 can leave your legs as scaly as a thirsty lizard , ’ says dr @entity57			2
‘ those comforting hot baths will have leached away natural hydrating lipids			2
’ this season ’s fashionable ripped jeans and off - the - shoulder tops mean every bit of you needs to be petal - soft			2
solution : ‘ exfoliate away dead dry skin and use a rich moisturiser all over , ’ says dr @entity57			2
@entity134 ’s @entity133 ( £ 10 , marksandspencer.com ) i whizz up a body scrub by slugging a glug of coconut oil into a jam jar , adding a mound of sea salt and shaking well			1
i smear the gloop all over me in the shower and get to work with a loofah			2
after rinsing , i apply @entity134 ’s @entity133 ( £ 10 , @entity146 , out at the end of the month )			2
it smells divine and the next morning my skin feels clean and silky			2
@entity0 rating : 8/10 @entity151 @entity21 : ‘ as skin loses collagen with time , it begins to sag , including on your upper arms , ’ says dr @entity57			2
not a problem when you can cover up with a cardigan , but tricky in a sleeveless dress			2
i have noticed that my arms look saggy			2
i have my eye on some sleeveless tops from @entity164 , but i ’m reluctant to remove my cardies			2
solution : ultrasound waves stimulate collagen production to make skin plump and radiant			0
i try the @entity170 ( £ 175 , harrods.com ) , by @entity172 skin specialist @entity171			0
i apply conductor gel to the metal head and move it in a circular motion over my left arm			0
all i feel is a slight warmth			0
apparently , results may be seen within three minutes — but not on me			0
the company claims any benefits will appear over a few weeks			0
@entity0 rating : 4/10 @entity182 with @entity183 , £ 6.99 @entity184 problem : the fashion for pale skin means you ca n’t conceal wispy hairs under a layer of fake tan			0
‘ @entity192 , end - of - winter skin means dark hairs on arms stand out more , ’ says dr @entity57			0
solution : ‘ hair removal creams will probably be better than waxing , ’ says dr @entity57			0
‘ it ’s hard to hold skin taut and pull off a waxing strip with one hand			0
’ i invest in @entity203 with @entity183 , £ 6.99 ( boots.com ) and smooth it on my @entity206 five minutes i remove it with the spatula and wipe the area clean			0
my skin looks and feels like satin			0
@entity0 rating : 9/10 baby soft knees problem : my knees are so wrinkly they look like walnuts			0
solution : ‘ @entity218 algae is good for hydrating , especially super-dry areas such as knees and elbows , ’ says dr @entity57			0
so i try a @entity223 peel - off mask ( £ 9.99 , boots.com )			0
this bright red mask comes in a black cylinder with two sachets that you mix in the lid , apply , then peel off			0
@entity223 peel - off mask ( £ 9.99 , boots.com ) @entity233 wax strip ( £ 7.29 , superdrug.com ) when mixed , the powder and clear gel turn into a vibrant poster paint gloop , which i slop on my knees			0
after 15 minutes , the mask is set hard and i peel it off to reveal baby - soft knees			0
a great one - off			0
@entity0 rating : 7/10 @entity240 @entity21 : ‘ open - toed mules are in fashion , so hairy @entity244 toes must be dealt with , ’ says podiatrist @entity245			0
solution : ‘ wax toes , ’ says @entity245			0
‘ hairs here are thick and you ’ll see the ends of the follicles if you shave			0
’ prepare feet by soaking in hot water and scrub with a nailbrush , then apply a cream such as @entity255 ( £ 16 , supplefeet.com ) , which contains lactic acid to melt away dead skin			0
i cut a strip from a @entity233 wax strip ( £ 7.29 , superdrug.com ) and apply it along each toe			0
when i rip it off , my feet look cleaner and well - groomed			0
