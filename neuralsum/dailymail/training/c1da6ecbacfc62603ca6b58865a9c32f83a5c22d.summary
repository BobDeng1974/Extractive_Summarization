manufacturers hope the cigarette - like sticks , which contain tobacco , will appeal to smokers heatsticks are set to be launched in @entity5 and @entity6 this year @entity7 has purchased a @entity9 e-cigarette maker , @entity10 the tobacco giant behind @entity12 has developed a new type of e-cigarette which it claims could reduce the harmful toxins found in smoke			1
@entity17 has spent more than £ 1.2 billion developing the electrically powered product - known as the @entity18 - which heats tobacco rather than burning it			1
it believes the device , which will be available in @entity5 and @entity6 later this year , produces less toxins than an ordinary cigarette			1
the @entity18 , pictured inside the @entity25 pen holder , is heated to 350 degrees @entity26 to create a tobacco - flavoured nicotine vapour			1
the pen is re-charged inside the battery , pictured behind the @entity18 , by plugging it into the mains using the usb connection and plug the product , which looks like a cigarette , works when it is placed inside a holder – a device developed by an external company called @entity25			0
this heats the tobacco to a maximum temperature of @entity43 ( @entity44 ) to create a tobacco flavored vapour			0
the holder can heat 20 ' cigarettes ' on a charge , and come with a mains usb charger			0
while most e-cigarettes ( pictured ) deliver a nicotine hit they do not contain tobacco - unlike @entity53 , which do while the @entity53 bear a resemblance to e-cigarettes there is one major difference – tobacco			1
e-cigarettes instead contain liquid nicotine , which is heated up and turned into a vapor that is inhaled or ‘ vaped ’ by the smoker			0
since the tobacco is heated up rather than burned , the @entity18 produces an aerosol instead of smoke			0
@entity65 , head of reduced - risk product communications at @entity7 , said : ‘ we are conducting extensive scientific studies to determine whether the @entity18 can support claims of reduced exposure to harmful constituents in smoke compared to smoking ordinary cigarettes			1
’ it is n’t the first time a product like this has been developed ; heating technology was first introduced in the 1990s in the form of a cigarette called @entity80 but failed to catch on with smokers because they were difficult to use and did n't taste the same as a cigarette			1
how do e-cigarettes work ? e-cigarettes are battery powered and contain a cartridge filled with nicotine			0
when the user inhales , the nicotine is drawn into an atomizing chamber , where it is heated and turned into a vapour			0
the vapour is inhaled like a normal cigarette and a nicotine hit is delivered to the lungs without tar or @entity96 do @entity53 work ? the cigarette - like sticks are heated to maximum of 350 degrees @entity26 in a hollow pen - like device to create a tobacco - flavoured nicotine vapour			1
they contain tobacco which is heated instead of burned to eliminate toxins found in smoke			0
but manufacturers reckon the recent craze for e-cigarettes shows smokers are more open to dabbling in alternative products			2
@entity111 , head of consumer marketing for @entity113 who created @entity80 , said : ' smokers then considered @entity80 to be a very foreign , very different , very novel concept in smoking , where today , compared to electronic cigarettes , tobacco heating cigarettes are much more familiar			2
' chief executive of @entity7 , @entity119 , agrees			2
he said : ' products like the @entity18 represent a potential paradigm shift for the industry , public health and adult smokers			0
' meanwhile e-cigarettes remain a popular alternative for many smokers			0
so much so , that @entity7 purchased @entity9 - based e-cigarette maker @entity10 for an undisclosed sum on tuesday			1
@entity10 , founded in 2008 and based in @entity130 , is best known for its @entity132 brand			2
