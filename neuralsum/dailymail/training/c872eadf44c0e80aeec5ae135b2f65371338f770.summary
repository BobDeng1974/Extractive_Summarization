nicknamed the @entity2 spaceship because of its vast circular shape , the 175 - acre project will feature a man - made forest of more than 7,000 trees and the building itself will take almost quarter of an hour to walk around			1
the ring - shaped structure was @entity1 ’ brainchild , yet after his death @entity19 designer @entity18 took the project on with the help of architect sir @entity22 , and now the local council has approved their ambitious plans			1

nicknamed the @entity2 spaceship because of its vast circular shape , the 2.8 million - square - foot campus 2 project is expected to cost a total of $ 5 billion when @entity1 first submitted the plans back in 2011 the campus was billed as ' the best office building in the world '			1
it has taken since then to get approval from the local council and its likely the campus wo n't be completed until 2016			2
reports in april claimed the project had already exceeded its budget by around $ 2 billion ( £ 1.32bn ) , pushing the total cost up to around $ 5 billion ( £ 3.14 billion ) and putting it a year behind schedule			0
earlier this year @entity2 was asked to submit new plans with updated landscaping designed , a slightly revised floor layour , renderings , and a bicycle plan , however the overall main design was n't changed			1
under these updated plans , the campus was renamed @entity52 2			2
appearing as a giant saucer the @entity54 site near the @entity55 will be home to 13,000 @entity2 employees			2
the spaceship will have 360 - degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000 - seater auditorium , a gym and 300,000 square feet of ' research ' space			2

the site was previously owned by @entity102 and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt			0
the new images also show access roads that lead into tunnels that take cars into the underground car park			0

this auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests			0
during his initial proposals , @entity2 's co-founder @entity1 said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor - to - ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building 's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light , pictured much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone - coloured walls to add to the building 's natural - looking design , pictured			1
the 175 - acre @entity54 site near the 280 highway will house 13,000 staff this image shows the @entity52 2 from above			0
the site will be surrounded by a man - made forest featuring 7,000 trees			1

and this will be a place for the most creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades to come			0
’ the circular , four - storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the @entity178 as a ‘ massive glass doughnut ’			1
earlier this year @entity2 was asked to submit updated plans from the original 2011 design			1
this led to the campus being renamed as @entity52 2			0

the new images , pictured , show access roads that lead into tunnels that will take cars into this underground car park not all of the parking spaces will be hidden			0
the parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show , according to this latest image from @entity2 , will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in the building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air - conditioning for 70 per cent of the year , low energy led lighting where natural light does n’t reach , and on - site recycling			1
‘ this will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world , ' ’ said @entity2 ’s @entity207			0

it will cover at least two storeys of the predominantly glass building and will feature oak tables and chairs the cafeteria will also feature an outside dining and picnic area , pictured			1
@entity2 's @entity226 additionally comes with a fitness centre in the northern part of the building ' the concept of the building , ' @entity158 said , ' is collaboration and fluidity			2
it 'll provide a very open - spaced system , so that at one point in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find yourself on the other side later that day			0
' @entity2 ’s current office building at 1 @entity255 will remain and the new offices down the road will be built in addition to the current offices , which house around 2,600 workers			2
