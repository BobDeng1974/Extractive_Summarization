he fought in the two - month @entity20 which claimed more than 140,000 lives and was a turning point in @entity5 's eventual victory			1
mr @entity11 also fought in the @entity25 offensive where the @entity15 side faced the might of @entity5 's forces which were bolstered by more than 100,000 extra troops supplied by @entity31 dictator @entity30			1

mr @entity11 was among illustrious company , joining trade union leader @entity65 and writers @entity66 and @entity68 among more than 35,000 volunteers from across the globe to sign up to fight against @entity5 's army			1
when captured by @entity5 's men , mr @entity11 was taken to a prisoner - of - war camp at @entity74 near @entity75 in northern @entity52			1
conditions there were crowded and filthy and with food and medical facilities woefully inadequate , most of the camp 's captives suffered sickness			0
mr @entity11 made it out alive , but a fifth of those taken prisoner were not so lucky			2
after he was freed by @entity5 's forces , mr @entity11 served in the @entity89 in the royal navy			1

' the only known @entity3 survivor of the @entity4 to outlive mr @entity11 is @entity115 who now lives in @entity116			1
the @entity4 was made up of volunteers from 54 countries			2
many signed up to fight because they were alarmed at the thought of another @entity122 country succumbing to facism			0
pleas from the @entity52 government for help from other @entity122 countries when the @entity128 and @entity31 decided to back the rebel forces fell on death ears - many were afraid that their involvement would lead to a continent - wide conflict and believed that the best way to avoid that was by keeping the @entity128 and @entity31 appeased			0
but with @entity52 on its own , bystanders from all over the world signed up to help the @entity138 , vetted and enrolled in @entity139 by a communist group there			0
the @entity4 took part in a staunch defence of @entity143 after the government fled to @entity145 as rebel forces approached			0

the war began after a declaration of opposition from a group of generals of the @entity172 against the elected government of the @entity15 led by @entity174 , voted in just five months previously			0
the coup was supported by military units in @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and elsewhere , but units from major cities such as @entity182 , @entity143 and @entity145 were opposed leaving the country divided both in terms of military and politics			0
the rebels led by @entity5 waged a war of attrition against their opponents and gained the support of @entity192 and @entity31 under dictator @entity30			0
the @entity3 's official stance was one of non-intervention , but that did n't stop thousands signing up to fight with the @entity199			2
