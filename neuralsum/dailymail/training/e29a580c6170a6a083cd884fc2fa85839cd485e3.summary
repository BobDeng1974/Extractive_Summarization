someday in the near future , amputees will be able to print an artificial limb with the latest updates in a matter of hours			2
that 's the goal of @entity7 technology designer , @entity6 , who has created a unique artificial hand , dubbed ' @entity9 '			1
the hand uses electrical signals generated from the brain to move mechanical fingers , in the same way that muscles move when neurons are fire off signals			1
' we can manufacture the hand and all of its moving components in a single piece and with a single print , ' the company writes on its website			2
in the current designs , electrodes are attached to the muscle of the remaining part of an amputee 's arm			1
these can read brain signals and convert them into the movements of the plastic hand , using a type of microcontroller known as @entity49			1
@entity9 is 3d - printed from nylon dust , meaning designs for the device can be downloaded online and created by anyone who owns a 3d printer @entity55 says its prosthetics will also be able to be made for a reasonable price , as @entity49 is relatively cheap and runs on open source software @entity55 says its prosthetics will also be able to be made for a reasonable price , as @entity49 is relatively cheap and runs on open source software			1
' there 's electricity in all muscles of our body , ' mr @entity6 told @entity68 at @entity69			2
' when the brain sends an impulse to the muscle , the sensor reads it and translates it into a number proportional to the contraction and then sends this message to the microcontroller			1
' he told @entity69 that amputees will be able to update the hardware and software of their limbs in the same way we update our smartphones			0
but mr @entity6 said even healthy humans may be able to use a third limb , for instance when an astronaut is repairing the @entity90			1
' i started this device as a prosthetic , but it can have many applications , ' mr @entity6 says			2
' i hope i can do something for humanity like the @entity97 , ' he added			0
in the current designs , electrodes are attached to the muscle of the remaining part of an amputee 's @entity102 can read brain signals and convert them into the movements of the plastic hand , using a type of microcontroller known as @entity49 ' i started this device as a prosthetic , but it can have many applications , ' mr @entity6 says			1

pictured is a scene from the 2008 film @entity97 amputees will be able to update the hardware and software of their limbs in way we update our smartphones pictured is @entity124 a @entity125			0
the system has worked for two - and - a - half years in mr @entity128 's case in october , researchers showed how two patients fitted with radical new artificial limbs that interface directly with their skeleton and nervous system			0
they were able to identify objects that touched their skin , and do everything from chop wood to drive trucks			0
one , a man who lost his right hand in an industrial accident four years ago could feel objects again thanks to a bionic hand with a sense of touch			0
wearing a blindfold @entity128 , 48 , was aware of arm hairs rising when a researcher brushed the back of his artificial device with a cotton ball			1
the system - which is limited to the lab at this stage - has worked for two - and - a - half years in mr @entity128 's case and 18 months for a second patient in the trial @entity158			0
similar research involving prosthetic hands has reported sensation lasting one month and - in some cases - the ability to feel began to fade over weeks			0
because of @entity164 's and @entity166 's continuing progress researchers are hopeful the method can lead to a lifetime of use and optimistic a system can be developed for use at home within five years .			0

@entity9 hand , which is still in development , is printed using nylon
electrodes are attached to the muscle on part of an amputee 's arm
device then reads electrical brain signals to move mechanical fingers
@entity188 said even healthy humans may be able to use it as third limb
for instance , an astronaut could use something similar on the @entity90
