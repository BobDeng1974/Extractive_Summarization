by @entity0 with prices for limes as high as $ 1.50 this year because of a lime shortage in the @entity4 , margarita , gin & tonic drinkers and even guacamole lovers will be relieved to hear that prices are on their way back down			1
@entity4 's limes are imported almost exclusively from @entity12 , and whilst the demand never ceased , they became increasingly hard to come by with some bars and restaurants resorting to lemons or simply forgoing the citrus fruit altogether			1
40 - pound boxes of limes which were commanding $ 35 are now closer to $ 6 a box			1
now that the price is dropping once again , @entity12 farmers could n't be happier			1
reduced : a shortage in @entity12 , where 97 per cent of the @entity4 's limes are produced caused prices to skyrocket			1
at one stage prices for a single lime were as much as $ 1.50 but last week they were closer to 30 cents lime crime : the @entity31 drug cartel in @entity32 , @entity12 has been raiding lime groves and hijacking farmer 's trucks			1
above , vigilantes have organized to fight the cartel last week the @entity4 @entity38 said consumers paid on average 30 cents a lime , compared with 90 a few months ago			1
some , like @entity12 chains like @entity42 decided to take the hit hoping the shortage would pass			2
' i can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $ 36 a case , ' manager @entity45 said			2
' at one stage , the cases were costing us $ 110 a case			0
' across the border , in the outdoor wholesale lime market in @entity56 , @entity32 in @entity12 , dozens stand in line waiting for the pick - up trucks to pull up with the fruit which is known is green gold			1
alternatives : the shortage caused some restaurants and bars to charge more for lime - based drinks , or substitute with lemons			2
above limes are sorted in @entity69 , @entity12 last november ' the trucks barely stop and the limes are sold ... they 're selling like hotcakes , ' @entity70 , a lime buyer told @entity75			1
@entity12 's lime - producing states like @entity77 took a beating after bad weather and a fungal outbreak earlier this year			1
however the orchards in @entity32 ended up making record profits			2
recent improved weather and a decent spring crop means supplies are almost back to normal			0
the farmers of @entity32 are n't complaining about the price drop as they are still enjoying their record profits			2
a weight appears to have been lifted because they are no longer at the mercy of @entity12 's ruthless drug cartels			1
for more than a decade , at one stage every part of the lime business was controlled by one drug gang or another			2
the last few seasons have been controlled by the @entity31 cartel			0
@entity99 farmers reported that cartel members would raid their groves and hijack delivery trucks			0
many growers refused to even send their trucks on the road			0
winners and losers : one man has took advantage of the shortage by driving a u-haul truck to and from @entity112 and selling limes at @entity115 restaurants and bars			0
above a man unloads a truck - load full of @entity12 limes at a packing plant in @entity32 ' you 'd make the money and they would take it , they charged so - called taxes , quotas on everything , ' says @entity128			1
the drug gang would made specific demands on the farmers telling them where and when they could sell their crops and even at what price			0
they cartel would then take 10 per cent of the profits which would be as much as $ 2,000 a week			0
now , the federal police have begun a crackdown in the state			0
several top leaders of the cartel have been killed or arrested			0
three mayors and a former governor of @entity32 were arrested on charges of colluding with organized crime			0
but now everything appears to be green and the farmers are once again enjoying the fruits of their labor as they swap their ' green gold ' for greenbacks from across the border .			0

heavy rains in @entity12 caused a large loss of the lime crop this year , which was already *plagued* by *disease*
drug cartels in the state of @entity32 were adding to the *problem* , raiding what 's left in the groves and hijacking crop trucks
prices for a single lime in the @entity4 shot up to as high as $ 1.50 but now the prices are dropping and are closer to 30 cents
more than 90 *percent* of limes imported into the @entity4 come from @entity12 .
