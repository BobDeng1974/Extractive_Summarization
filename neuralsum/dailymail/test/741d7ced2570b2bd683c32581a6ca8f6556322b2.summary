a mysterious ‘ warm blob ’ of water off the @entity7 of the @entity8 could explain why states like @entity1 are experiencing their worst ever drought , while the @entity3 is battered by freezing weather			1
the blob in the ocean was discovered last year , with temperatures one to four degrees @entity12 ( two to seven degrees @entity13 ) above surrounding ‘ normal ’ water			1
and the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles ( 1,600km ) offshore , from @entity16 up to @entity17 , and could herald a warmer summer for some regions			1
since last june it has extended from @entity17 to @entity16			0
it has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere			1
and a new @entity29 study says it could be responsible for droughts a new study by the @entity29 found that a high - pressure ridge could be causing the blob , by trapping heat in the water			1
in june of last year , the huge patch of water stretched 1,000 miles ( 1,600km ) in each direction , and was 300ft ( 90 metres ) deep			1
dr @entity39 , a climate scientist at the @entity29 , coined the term ‘ the blob ’ in june			1
since the year 2000 , seven western states in the @entity8 has seen their driest periods in centuries : @entity46 , @entity1 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity16 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
and scientists in @entity1 have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '			1
the warnings came after sediment studies showed @entity1 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			2
in 2013 , @entity1 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850			2
however droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state			2
looking back over several thousand years , droughts have been known to last over a decade , and in some cases they can last a century			2
and the patterns tend to repeat , meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future			0
ten months later , the blob is now squashed up against the coast , and dr @entity39 says all models point to it continuing through the end of this year			2
‘ in the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big , almost circular mass of water that just did n't cool off as much as it usually did , so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year , ’ said dr @entity39			1
researchers said it may have contributed to the state of @entity88 's mild 2014 winter and might signal a warmer summer			0
but exactly how this area of warmer water has formed , or how long it will stay , remains a mystery			1
one thing that can be studied , though , is its effects			0
as air passes over warmer water and reaches the coast it brings more heat and less snow , which the scientists say helped cause current drought conditions in @entity1 , @entity101 and @entity88			2
the researchers said that it might not only be causing warmer temperatures on the @entity7 , but also cooler temperatures on the @entity96			0
it could also be playing a part in circulating cold and wet air to the central and eastern states of the @entity8			0
@entity1 's drought ( stock image shown left ) is one of the worst on record , while the @entity96 of the @entity8 ( @entity115 in @entity116 shown right ) has seen unusually cold temperatures it is also having an effect on marine life			0
fish have been spotted in unusual places , supporting recent reports that @entity7 marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm , less nutrient - rich @entity22 water			1
dr @entity39 noted that , while this phenomenon likely was n’t caused by global warming , it could be a sign of similar weather to come			0
‘ this is a taste of what the ocean will be like in future decades , ’ dr @entity39 said			0
‘ it was n't caused by global warming , but it 's producing conditions that we think are going to be more common with global warming			0
’ the ' blob ' is also having an effect on marine life			0
fish , like the @entity146 ( shown ) , have been spotted in unusual places , supporting recent reports that @entity7 marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm , less nutrient - rich @entity22 water			1

a ' blob ' of warm water 2,000 miles across is sitting in the @entity22
it has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere
@entity29 study says it could be responsible for droughts
but it is not clear where the blob has come from - or how long it will stay
