by @entity0 when their two - year - old son was diagnosed with a life - threatening brain tumor , @entity1 and @entity2 did n't think it could get much worse			1
but just weeks later , @entity1 , who is a @entity7 , also began feeling sick and doctors revealed the unthinkable : that he , too , had a brain tumor			1
now the family , who live at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , are trying to come to terms with the news as they attend medical appointments across the state			1
fighting together : @entity20 is pictured with his two - year - old son ; both have a brain tumor ' if it were to come worse to worse for me , i would rather have myself go than my son , ' @entity1 told @entity27			1
' i would rather him see that life that he deserves			0
' the family 's battle began in march when @entity31 began vomiting , suffering from nosebleeds and struggling with his balance			1
they took him to hospital , where he underwent a brain scan			2
doctors revealed that the toddler had a tumor the size of a tangerine in his brain - and that it was malignant			1
' i stopped and i cried and i cried , ' @entity2 told @entity27			0
' and my husband had to walk out of the room , just to take a breather real quick			0

he is now undergoing chemotherapy			2
but then in april , @entity1 began suffering numbness in his body and doctors revealed that he also had a tumor in his head			2
