an incredible video has emerged of a lioness taking down a baby giraffe at the @entity12 in @entity13			1
although lions have a tendency to avoid tackling such large prey , the giraffe proves no match for the astonishing lightning fast agility of the lioness			1
the lion slowly begins to creep towards its prey using bushes and shrubs to stay hidden from the craning view of the giraffe			2
she patiently sits in the long grass waiting for the giraffe to drop their guard and walk away from the trees			0
as the giraffe finish their meal and begin to walk towards a clearing , the lioness makes her move			2
as the giraffe begin to walk away from the bushes , the lion speeds up hoping to cut its prey off at the beginning of the clearing with a powerful burst of speed , the lioness suddenly breaks into a sprint and races towards the giraffe as the unsuspecting giraffe emerge from behind the trees , the lioness strikes and barely breaks stride before leaping high into the air the mother giraffe is helpless as the lioness strikes out dragging its bigger prey to the ground the pack of lions are pictured feasting on the giraffe after dark she stalks around the tree hoping to cut the unsuspecting pair off as they saunter away breaking into a run as she gets closer			1
as the two giraffe emerge from the cover of the trees the lioness strikes effortless breaking into a powerful sprint and leaping in the air			0
the lion twists and , claws first , manages to bring the baby giraffe down to the ground			0
with the mother left to helplessly look on , the stricken baby giraffe can still be seen breathing as it lays helplessly on the ground with its captor standing over it			1
the clip ends after dark , when the pack of lions enjoy the fruits of the lionesses labours and feast on the catch			0
lions in @entity23 tend to feast on wildebeest , zebras and buffalo			0
they are occasionally known to take down larger prey such as giraffes but it is a relatively rare practice due to the threat of injury because of their size .			0
