@entity9 , 50 , stormed @entity11 ’ house and blasted her and their daughter @entity12 with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him			1
beforehand , he subjected @entity17 to ‘ degrading assaults ’ by forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair			0
he then wounded his face with the gun himself following the attack last june			0
brute : former night club bouncer @entity9 , pictured left after being arrested over an unspecified incident prior to him murdering @entity11 and daughter @entity12 , and , right , baring his injured face last year after shooting himself following the savage killings			1
escape : @entity11 ' eldest daughter ( not pictured ) escaped the scene			2
her mum and sister @entity12 ( right ) were n't so lucky his were so grave that @entity36 have refused to release his arresting mugshot because it was ' too graphic '			1
instead they released a photo of @entity40 , who had a history of violent attacks against his former partner , taken following an earlier arrest			2
officers refused to reveal what he was held for on that occasion			0
last month the former nightclub bouncer admitted bringing a bottle of petrol , a drill and an axe round to the house late at night following a drunken night playing pool at a local pub but not to murder			0
but today at @entity62 a jury of seven men and six women found @entity40 , of @entity63 , @entity36 , guilty of two counts of murder after nearly nine hours of deliberation			2
mr @entity67 ordered @entity40 to serve a whole life sentence for the ‘ sadistic ’ killings , meaning he will never be released from prison			1
mr @entity67 he said : ‘ these tragic and needless deaths occurred in deeply shocking circumstances			1
‘ a bullying and controlling man , who had frequently inflicted violence on miss @entity11 during the six years of their relationship , killed his ex-partner and their young daughter simply because he knew she could not bear to be with him and wished to start a new life			2
’ the judge added that @entity85 ‘ carried not a shred of blame ’ for what happened			0
‘ instead of thinking of his daughter who he has claimed to love , he concentrated on himself alone and most particularly his desire for revenge and his determination that no other man was going to be @entity11 's partner or act as @entity12 's father , ’ the judge added			1
‘ he resolved that , if the family was at an end , that they would pay for leaving him with their lives and that their last hours of live would be terrifying and , in the case of @entity11 , extremely painful			1
’ the judge said @entity40 ‘ planned the deaths in elaborate detail ’ and took with him a series of implements to inflict pain on miss @entity11 during the attack at her home in @entity111			1
murdered : @entity112 and her daughter , @entity12 , two , were shot dead at close range with a shotgun he made her beg and proclaim her love for him while at the same time ‘ torturing ’ her , the judge added			1
miss @entity17 ' family wept as the judge said : ‘ @entity12 would have witnessed her mother 's gravely injured state and heard her cries for help			2
she would have seen the appalling injuries to her mother			0
‘ that little girl must have been terrified			0
‘ he then put the shotgun against her head and pulled the trigger			0
‘ no decent , civilised human being could ever describe that as being the result of love			0
’ @entity40 did not appear in court to be sentenced			0
@entity137 , in mitigation , said his client 's absence for the verdict and sentencing was ‘ not intended to show disrespect to the court , jury or the verdicts that have been passed ’			0
he added prison guards had been concerned for @entity40 's safety because he ‘ expressed emotions ’ which made them fear he may harm himself			2
murder weapon : the shotgun used by @entity9 to kill his partner and their two - year - old daughter brutal : a drill that @entity40 brought to the house in the ' elaborately planned ' attack @entity159 : @entity9 , pictured at a previous hearing , has denied two counts of murdering his ex-partner and her two - year - old daughter @entity164 , junior prosecution counsel , read an excerpt from a statement by miss @entity11 ' family			1
it said : ‘ the tragic loss of @entity170 and @entity12 has deeply impacted on all of our everyday lives			0
‘ no parents should have to outlive their child , let alone grandchild			0
’ miss @entity11 ' 10 - year - old daughter with former partner @entity177 witnessed the attack but escaped out of the bedroom window to her father 's house nearby			1
mr @entity164 said the 10 year old - @entity12 's half - sister - had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder ever since			1
@entity40 had some ‘ old and trivial ’ previous convictions committed ‘ within the context of his relationship with @entity11 ’ , he added			1
@entity188 , head of the @entity190 's @entity189 complex case unit , said outside court : ‘ this was an extremely violent and horrifying assault by @entity40 upon @entity85 in advance of a family court hearing over access to @entity12 and driven by a determination that he would kill both @entity11 and @entity12 before attempting to kill himself			1
‘ our thoughts are obviously with the family of @entity85 who behaved in such a dignified way throughout the trial			0

@entity9 planned savage shotgun attack in ' elaborate detail ' after deciding that the ' last hours of their lives would be terrifying
he tortured @entity11 while daughter ignoring his terrified daughter @entity12 's *cry* to stop
judge mr @entity67 said attack was ' needless ' as he *jailed* ' sadistic ' @entity216 *indefinitely*
