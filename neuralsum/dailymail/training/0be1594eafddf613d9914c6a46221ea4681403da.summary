by @entity0 published : 03:10 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 05:11 est , 17 september 2012 for dozens of years , cinema - fans have been charmed by the notion of tapping your heels together three times to go home			0
now artist @entity7 has combined cinema nostalgia with high - tech wizardry by combining shoes with a @entity12 circuit - board and blinking led lights to point you in the right direction			1
and , true to form , tapping your heels together will always guide you home			0
@entity7 said : ' i decided to make a pair of shoes that can navigate you home where ever you are			1
i thought about the @entity21 and how @entity46 could click her shoes together to go home			2
' he was commissioned by @entity50 , a visual arts and living heritage group based in @entity52 - which itself has a long heritage in footwear , including the headquarters of @entity57 and @entity58			0
the shoes come with @entity61 software and a usb cable , so that , once you have got home and tried your shoes on , you can then simply upload your home address , and from then on your shoes will tell you which way to walk			2
the gps antenna is embedded in the heal of the left shoe , which also contains a ring of @entity26 , which form a compass			1
there 's no place like home : @entity7 has created custom - soles for the design , showing a man 's journey as he heads back home the shoe meanwhile communicates wirelessly with the right shoe , which contains a progress bar , showing you how much further you need to stroll			1
these are not the only shoes coming out with @entity12			0
another pair aims to help @entity88 's victims - a £ 200 pair with gps which allows its wearer ’s location to be accurately pinpointed			2
the gps system , which is implanted in the heel of what appears to be a normal walking shoe , allows family members or carers to constantly monitor the wearer .			0

left shoe shows wearers which direction to walk in , while right show tells them how far they have to go
shoes can be *programmed* with a ' home ' location to *automatically* take *people* to at the *end* of a night
