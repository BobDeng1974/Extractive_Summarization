@entity5 and @entity6 were born at the @entity7 , now @entity8 , in @entity9 on november 3			1
they were given up by their unmarried mother and adopted by two different families in @entity9 - raised just a few miles from each other but never knowing they had a twin			1
the non-identical twins never knew the other existed and grew up just a few miles apart catching up on lost time : the twins raised by separate families in @entity9 now live apart but plan to regularly meet up and introduce their extended families both the girls were raised by @entity26 families and for a time even attended the same temple			1
they had some mutual friends and @entity5 even visited @entity6 's family record store where unbeknownst to her her twin sister worked			1
@entity5 , who used to have a radio show in @entity9 and now lives in @entity32 , told the today program : ' all my life i had this feeling something was missing , i did n't know it was somebody			1
' ' we used to walk to the store and she sometimes worked in the store			0
it was a wonderful place to be - maybe we saw each other ' she added			0
decades on @entity44 released a swathe of never before released birth records and contacted the women to ask if they wanted to see them			1
they both said yes and received them in the post			0
it is there they saw the birth certificate with the box ticked twin			2
' tears were rolling down my face , ' @entity5 , who now lives in @entity32 , told the @entity61			0
the papers had @entity6 's address so @entity5 tracked down her telephone number and called			1
' i had n’t opened the mail yet , ' @entity6 , a medical assistant who still lives in @entity9 , explained			1
' it ’s like someone dropped into my life from heaven			0
' shared interests : the twins have discovered they have a lot in common including a love of make up , food and singing separated at birth : the two sisters were adopted at babies and never knew they were twins			2

' we talked ; we cried ; we talked ; we cried , ' said @entity5			0
having a twin was a hard thing to get used to but since then the sisters have been making up for lost time			0
' my twin sister - it is still very strange to say it , ' @entity6 told the today programme			1
' i looked at it [ the birth certificate ] and did n't quite understand it			0
twin ? how could i be a twin and not know it ? how could this be ? the women had to explain it to their own families and tell their children they had a new aunt they never knew existed			2
' both of our families reacted the same way , ' @entity6 told the @entity61			2
' they said ‘ i ca n’t believe there is another one of you out there			0
' the sisters wo n't reveal their age but they would admit @entity6 is the slightly older of the two			2
