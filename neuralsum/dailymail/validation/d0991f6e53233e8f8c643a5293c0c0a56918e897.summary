in the vast , white expanse of @entity2 , one glacier bleeds a shocking red			1
known as @entity5 , the dramatic colour comes from the two million - year - old iron - heavy brine trapped under the ice			1
now , for the first time , scientists have taken uncontaminated samples from deep beneath the glacier in the hope of finding microbial life			1
in the vast , white expanse of @entity2 , one glacier bleeds a shocking red			1
known as @entity5 , the dramatic colour comes from the two million - year - old iron - heavy seawater trapped under the ice they believe that ' extremophiles ' possibly living under the surface could be unique in their ability to survive – and they may even help in the search for alien life on other planets			1
scientists recently sent a probe into the ice of @entity29 to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red - stained feature			1
' this is going to be an exciting sample to play with , ' @entity34 , an assistant professor of microbiology at the @entity36 told @entity39 she explained that @entity5 ' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron - rich , brine liquid			1
its chemistry is changed by bacteria , which transforms sulphur and iron compounds in order to survive			1

@entity5 ' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron - rich , brine @entity54 chemistry is changed by bacteria , which transforms sulphur and iron in order to survive the @entity61 ) project , led by @entity63 has developed a unique probe , dubbed @entity65			1
pictured is the @entity67 poised for action when the liquid oxidises at the surface , it creates a blood - red colour			2
but to learn more about the bacteria , scientists needed samples that were oxidised			1
the @entity61 ) project , led by @entity63 developed a unique probe , dubbed @entity65			0
it looks like a rectangular metal box with a copper head and ice screw that can melt through ice , ' it can drive curved trajectories through bulk ice			0
it can go sideways , up and down			0
if you want to reach any point , you can go there , ' @entity86 , a @entity87 physicist told @entity39 to help the probe navigate , scientists sent acoustic pulses from the surface into the ice			2
this is similar to a gps but uses different kinds of waves that use sound to track the position of the @entity67			0
cold - loving , fresh - water algae known as @entity103 that contain a bright red pigment can cause snow to appear red @entity106 appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it			2
anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light , which looks white			0
other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple , for instance , reflects only mostly the green wavelength			2
but , as reported by @entity122 , when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue			0
the reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow , according to the @entity106 and @entity127 ( @entity128 ) ‘ as light waves travel into the snow or ice , the ice grains scatter a large amount of light , ’ the @entity128 explains			0
while most of the light is reflected , there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue			0
when you see just the surface of a pack of snow , the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice			0
but if you look into a significant amount of snow , about 3.3ft ( one metre ) or so , more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end			0
when snow appears red , though , it is for an entirely different reason			0
this effect is due to cold - loving , fresh - water algae known as @entity103 that contain a bright red pigment			2
also known as ‘ watermelon snow ’ , it is ‘ most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions ’			0
the team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at @entity5			1
they also used seismometers to image the ice and bedrock below , and gps units to track glacial movement			0
the team are now in the process of analysing the samples			2
' it offers us a portal , or window , to the subglacial world … a sample of material from that ice - covered interior , ' said professor @entity34			1
scientists say the results could reveal how life could exist on moons like @entity187 's @entity186 and @entity189 's @entity188			1
both moons are believed to have liquid oceans beneath icy crusts			0
the scientists sent a probe into the ice of @entity29 to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red - stained feature			1
the crevassed , rough , slick surface of @entity29 makes it a challenging location for research @entity5 is an outflow of an iron oxide - tainted plume of saltwater , flowing from the tongue of @entity29 onto the ice - covered surface of @entity210 in the @entity211 the team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at @entity5			1
they also used seismometers to image the ice and bedrock below , and gps units to track glacial movement			0
the @entity223 team are pictured working on @entity29 in the @entity211			0

@entity5 is an outflow of an iron oxide - tainted saltwater in @entity2
organisms living there have been able to survive in extreme conditions
their ability to survive could aid search for alien life in our solar *system*
for the first time , scientists have *captured* an uncontaminated sample
they are now analysing it to learn more about these extreme creatures
