the advert was placed on july 16 with the provocative title of ‘ sugar baby for my son ’ and the mom goes on to explain that she is looking for a young woman , under 19 years old , willing to turn her boy into a man			1
there is no proof that the plea is real , however			0

her offer which is open to any @entity46 - based woman aged 19 or younger is simple – ‘ i want to find a cute young girl to date him and turn him from high school nerd to cool college kid , ’ she explains			1

then the chosen girl will ‘ spring into action ’ , start talking to her boy during the concert and will ‘ eventually pick him up			2
’ the conniving mom has a very clear idea of how this first date should end			2
