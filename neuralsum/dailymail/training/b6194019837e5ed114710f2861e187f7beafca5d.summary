it was a good question but it was hard to suppress a snort of derision : did @entity4 feel he had a moral obligation to take part in qualifying here for the @entity9 @entity8 ? the context is that @entity12 ’s endlessly arcane rules mean that taking a sixth engine of the season — one more than the rules allow — would condemn him to start at the back of the grid , rendering his qualifying session pointless before he turns a wheel in competition			1
so @entity4 , the winner of last year ’s race , who is facing that possibility , could sit out saturday ’s action or merely put in one lap to do what is necessary — it is called qualifying for a reason — to race on sunday			1
@entity4 ( left ) says it will be a big shame if he has to miss qualifying on saturday for the @entity9 @entity8 @entity4 was in @entity32 during previews ahead of the @entity9 @entity8 on wednesday if so , fans at the @entity35 of the @entity36 here in @entity32 are entitled to feel short - changed when they are paying between £ 385 and £ 745 for main grandstand tickets			1
more so given that @entity41 and @entity42 , the two backmarkers who are in administration , will also be missing from the entire weekend ’s action			0
so , the moral teaser : did @entity4 not feel obliged to get out on the track as much as possible ? ‘ you can talk about obligations , but in the end we have to manage the situation with the engines , ’ said the @entity46 , knowing that morality and @entity12 are not natural bedfellows			1
‘ the situation is what it is			0
i ’d love to change it , to qualify in the normal way and use every practice session to the maximum			1
@entity4 ( left ) poses with team - mate @entity62 of @entity63 during the preview in @entity65 @entity4 of @entity66 drives an @entity67 along @entity68 in @entity32 ‘ but the rules are pretty clear			1
once you decide to take a sixth engine , sixth turbo , all the pieces , you have to start from the pit lane , even if you qualify on pole			1
‘ so you would not want to burn mileage in qualifying that you would regret later in @entity77 or @entity78 , where you might not see the finish line			2
but i see your point , and it would be a real shame			2
’ instead , @entity4 gave a sprinkling of fans an exhibition on @entity85 ’s streets yesterday afternoon			1
in the shadow of the @entity88 building , he pulled doughnuts — rubber - burning wheel - spins — in an old @entity66 , its v8 engine screeching across the city			2
not that the noise level will be the same at the out - of - town circuit , the turbo engines with their low growl being a faint echo of the old banshee yell			2
@entity4 , the current champions , is 148 points behind leader @entity101 in the @entity12 standings @entity4 won the 2013 @entity9 @entity8 from pole position , before going on to win the title given the plight of @entity41 and @entity42 , both of which are based in @entity109 , there will be plenty of introspection in the paddock this weekend			1
the chief question will be whether @entity12 ’s prize money and spending power is too concentrated among the bigger teams			2
@entity117 , the @entity118 chairman and airline magnate , believes so , having given up on @entity41 after starting with all sorts of avowed ambitions			0
‘ people can blame whoever but the big teams are as much at fault as anyone , ’ he told @entity122			0
‘ the gap has become way too big and it is money			0
and so i thought , “ well , i ca n’t compete ”			0
but i can compete at @entity118 ; i can compete at @entity130			0
‘ rather than continue , you have got to be brave and say , “ look , we screwed up			0
you ca n’t compete ; you thought you could and it is time to leave ”			0
but the sport has to examine itself as well			0

@entity4 feels it will be ' a shame ' if he is unable to run in qualifying
the @entity46 may have to change the complete power unit on his *car*
that would mean the four - time champion would incur a pit - lane start
