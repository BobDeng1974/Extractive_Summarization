@entity0 , who was interviewed under caution shortly after the crash , told police she must have pressed the accelerator rather than the brake , and had swerved to try and avoid mr @entity12			1
ms @entity62 said : ' the pressing of the wrong pedal continued for a long period of time and carried on even after her husband had told her to remove her foot			2
' defence attorney @entity81 told the court that @entity0 is a full - time carer for her husband who is almost bedbound , and that she has vowed never to get behind the wheel of a car again			2
' she 's still having difficulty sleeping since the incident , her doctor has asked her to go on a stronger dose of anti-depressants but as sole carer for her husband she does n't feel she would be able to do that as it would have an effect on her ability to look after him , ' she said			0
mr @entity12 was described as a ' very careful cyclist ' who used to be semi-professional , pictured with his niece ' she 's shown remorse and you have seen a copy of the pre-sentence report , so we say that the only aggravating feature was that the cyclist was vulnerable - it was pedal confusion and a momentary lapse			1

@entity0 is a full - time carer for her husband who suffers from advanced @entity146 and is almost bedbound ' this was n't a question of someone who drove over a long period carelessly , unaware or uncaring of other people on the road - it was a few seconds that had desperate consequences			2
' ' the probation service have heard her remorse and whilst she says this whole thing is a blur blotted out in her mind she will think about this incident every day for the rest of her life			0
' from the very first moment she has admitted that she was responsible for this death and i do n't think i could say or do anything to this elderly lady more eloquently than she says to herself			0
' all of us that drive a car have at one point or another suddenly realised that for a second or two we have not concentrated as much as we might			0
' ' i am not sending this 74 - year - old woman to prison and it 's not within my power to do so , it would not be just to do so			2
