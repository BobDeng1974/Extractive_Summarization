a statement released by @entity13 in june read : ' a study of the area from @entity34 @entity33 town centre to @entity7 and beyond has been commissioned by @entity13 â€™s owner @entity37			0
@entity7 is surrounded by housing , buildings and a railway line ' this study will review the potential for improvements to publicly - owned areas along @entity60 and the area around the football ground , including the possibility of decking over the railway lines to the east and north of the ground			1
this could create landscaped public walkways and cycleways , while also reducing pedestrian traffic on @entity60 and nearby streets on match days			0
' the study will also assess the feasibility of an expansion of the stadium within the existing historic site boundaries , potentially to enlarge its capacity , enhance its facilities and improve the movement of people and vehicles on match and non-matchdays			0
