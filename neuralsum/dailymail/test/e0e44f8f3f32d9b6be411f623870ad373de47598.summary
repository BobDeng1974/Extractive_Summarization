@entity1 manager @entity0 says he will listen to @entity2 before deciding whether the @entity3 has a future at the @entity5			1
the once - capped @entity7 striker has spent a frustrating season on loan at @entity10 where injury has seen him make just five appearances for @entity15 's @entity14 giants			1
@entity2 scored 22 goals in his first season at @entity1 after signing from @entity18 for £ 2.2million in july 2012 and broke into the @entity7 squad , but two injury - riddled campaigns since have raised doubts about his future in south @entity23			1
@entity0 will hold talks with @entity2 , pictured in 2013 , before making decision on @entity3 's future @entity2 recently said he did not know whether he would be returning to @entity1 after his spell at @entity10 the 29 - year - old told @entity29 newspaper @entity28 last week he did not know whether he would be returning to @entity1 this summer to see out the final year of his contract - and @entity31 was also giving few clues when the subject was raised ahead of @entity36 's @entity35 visit on saturday			1
' i 'm sure we will make contact with @entity2 before the end of season , ' @entity0 said			1
' but we 'll let his season finish and our season finish before we sit down at some point to discuss the future			0
' i know he 's had a difficult time with injury and his concentration right now is on getting back to fitness			0
' he 'll want to finish the season off strong there and i 'll speak to him in the summer			0
' i 'll get his side of things and where he wants to take his future and i 'll assess it from my side as well			0
' @entity31 has been keeping a close eye on @entity2 during the @entity3 's loan spell at @entity59 outfit @entity10 @entity2 scored only twice in the @entity35 last season before joining @entity10 and @entity0 made it clear that the player was determined to head to @entity59			1
' i had a good discussion with him last summer and this was the way he wanted to go with @entity10 , ' @entity0 said			1
' but he 's coming back to full fitness now and hopefully he will have a good end to the season there			2
' i 've got a good relationship with @entity2 , we were team - mates before i became manager , and i was fine with how he wanted to go			2
' i 've kept an eye on him and it 's our duty as a club to understand what 's exactly going on with @entity2 on a game to game basis			2
' he has n't had a sustained period where he 's been fit and it 's always hard as a player when that happens			0
' he 's been unfortunate , but if he get can a sustained period of fitness i 'm sure you 'll see the quality we 've seen here			0
' @entity31 has heaped praise on @entity85 following the striker 's recent fine goalscoring form one player who has been fit and firing , however , is @entity90 striker @entity85 who has scored three goals in his last two appearances as @entity1 have recorded back - to - back wins over @entity94 and @entity95 to move within a single point of their best @entity35 haul with seven games still remaining			1
@entity85 had a difficult first half to the season playing second fiddle to @entity102 but the @entity104 's initial £ 25million sale to @entity105 has seen him become the club 's first - choice striker and he has grasped the opportunity in recent weeks			0
' when @entity102 left and he was starting games @entity110 was probably too eager to do well , ' @entity0 said			2
' his effort and commitment have always been great but he was trying too hard to score goals			0
' he 's kept that effort and commitment but he 's probably more relaxed now , he 's showing his composure in games now and that is vitally important			0

@entity2 has made just five appearances since joining @entity10 on loan deal
the @entity1 striker has one more year to run on his @entity1 contract
@entity125 boss @entity0 plans to contact @entity2 before end of campaign
