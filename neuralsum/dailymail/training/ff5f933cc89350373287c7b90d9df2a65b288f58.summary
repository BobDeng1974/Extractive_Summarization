in the clammy midnight darkness of a jungle clearing in northern @entity2 , two police officers and a woman investigator crouch beside a pile of cages containing more than 500 howling dogs			1
yards away , a gang of heavily armed men move through the trees to encircle them			2
terrified , outnumbered and cornered after tracking down a cargo of animals hidden in the jungle before being smuggled to neighbouring countries , the police officers appear doomed to pay the ultimate price for meddling in the brutally lucrative dog meat trade			2
as the tide of panic rises , one officer jumps to his feet from behind the crates and draws his revolver			0
firing rapidly into the air , he runs around the clearing shouting out to imaginary colleagues to trick the smugglers into thinking more police are hidden in the undergrowth			2
the desperate gamble pays off , sending the gunmen into retreat and buying the cornered trio enough time for reinforcements to arrive as the gangsters melt away into the surrounding jungle			2
this is the frontline of the war against the dog meat trade – a bleak and perilous struggle to stop hundreds of thousands of dogs a year being snatched from the streets and then smuggled and slaughtered in horrendous conditions for their meat			1
but as a @entity72 investigation in @entity73 found , bringing an end to the savage trade which claims the lives of millions of dogs a year is a monumental challenge with the lives not only of dogs as stake but also those of the people dedicated to ending the slaughter			1
with huge profits at stake , the smuggling gangs are ruthlessly switching tactics to ward off the threat to their trade – and have started slaughtering dogs before they leave @entity2 to reduce the chances of live cross-border shipments being detected			1
the industry is reckoned to be worth around £ 20 million a year in @entity2 alone and is driven by highly organised criminal gangs involved not only in the dog meat business but in narcotics and human smuggling			1
the struggle against the dog meat trade in @entity2 is being championed by @entity102 - run charity @entity101 which commissioned the video appeal and whose chief investigator , mrs @entity104 , was caught up in the jungle raid in may which nearly ended in tragedy			1
a diminutive married woman in her late 40s , mrs @entity104 – whose real identity is being kept secret because of the risk of her being targeted by smuggling gangs – has helped in dozens of arrests and the blocking of shipments of thousands of dogs in the past year alone			2
snatched for meat : these dogs have been rescued in the @entity2 jungle but were destined to be skinned and turned into luxury dishes that are believed to improve mens ' potency an intercepted cargo of dogs destined for the dog meat trade is unloaded at a rescue centre in northern @entity2 her efforts are focussed in the lawless @entity130 area of northern @entity2 where stolen dogs are caged in secluded jungle areas before being smuggled across the border to @entity134 and then on to @entity55 where an estimated five million dogs a year are eaten			1
it was in the jungle near @entity130 that mrs @entity104 found herself surrounded by the armed gang			2
' of course i 'm scared about what might happen to me but i ca n't give up and i 'm going to carry on with this fight , ' she told @entity72 calmly			0
' the dog meat trade has deep roots in @entity2			2
it has been here for a long time and powerful , dangerous people run the business			0
it will not stop easily			0
' most of the dogs rescued by @entity104 and her team members are much - loved pet dogs snatched at night from homes across @entity2 for the equivalent of a few pounds each by thieves who drag them with ropes behind motorbikes before selling them on to dog meat gangs			1
crammed together in metal cages in which many of them die , up to 1,500 dogs at a time are then taken up to hundreds of miles by lorry to jungle camps in northern @entity2 where they remain in the cages in stifling heat for days waiting to be smuggled to @entity172 or @entity55			1
their ordeals finally end when they are beaten senseless with metal pipes , immersed in boiling water to loosen their fur and skinned – often still alive – before being served up in restaurants from @entity179 to @entity180 where dog dishes can cost up to £ 30			1
clubbed to death : dogs that have already been slaughtered piled in the back of a van by smugglers in @entity2 desperate for escape : caged dogs transported in cramped by smugglers in @entity2 - they were later intercepted and rescued as part of a campaign that has only dented the dog smuggling trade in @entity2 , giant posters paid for by overseas donors have been put up across northern @entity2 offering rewards of £ 100 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of dog smugglers			1
the @entity101 also pays bonuses to police officers who take part in operations , according to founder @entity205 – a 65 - year - old former chemical engineer from @entity207 who set up the charity after retiring to @entity209 in @entity2 with wife @entity210 11 years ago and now provides shelters for some 2,500 rescued dogs			1
' you might argue it 's immoral to pay rewards to police officers , ' he said			2
' but i look on this as a war , and we have to do what we can to stop this trade			0
it is proving effective and it 's worth the outlay if we can achieve that goal			0
' this is n't a question of whether it 's right or wrong to eat dogs			2
the reason we got involved in this is because of the inherent cruelty of the business , from start to finish			0
' up to last year , an estimated 500,000 dogs a year were being smuggled across the @entity54 from @entity2 to @entity134 and then on to @entity55 , where dog meat is a popular dish with young middle - class men who believe it makes them more potent			1
pet dogs snatched from homes across @entity2 at night were sold to gangs who could make tenfold profits on shipments of stolen dogs as soon as they crossed the @entity54 to @entity134 , with local border guards bribed to turn a blind eye			1
now , thanks to an anti-rabies agreement between @entity2 , @entity134 and @entity55 last year bringing in tougher penalties for the trans - border shipment of live dogs , there has been a sharp decrease in the cross-border smuggling of live dogs			1
rescued but needing a home : briton @entity205 with rescued dogs at the @entity101 centre in @entity209 , @entity2 in its place , however , equally brutal methods of profiting from the trade have emerged			1
dogs are now slaughtered and chopped up in the jungles of northern @entity2 clearings and then smuggled silently across borders in ice buckets on the back of lorries			1
a raid conducted by police and investigators on an illegal tannery in @entity275 , northern @entity2 , on october 17 found scores of dead dogs lying across the floor and strung up to be skinned			1
meat was being sold for both domestic and overseas consumption			0
sources in the dog meat trade have told investigators that another major dog meat trader in the area is breeding and slaughtering weeks - old puppies to be smuggled out of @entity2 sold as single - meal delicacies for diners in @entity55 and @entity172			2
days after the raid at @entity275 , the @entity101 received a pitiful email from a desperate pet owner saying he believed his dog was among the animals found there			0
' she is a much loved pet who was stolen at night from our home , ' the pet owner wrote			0
' we are just praying that she survived			0
we know it is a slim chance but please help us if you can			0
' sadly , by the time investigators reached the scene , every single dog was dead			0
as the stakes are raised in the fight to end the dog meat trade and greater pressure is exerted on the gangs , @entity205 knows the potential risks to himself and his investigators from the gangs behind it are escalating too			0
' i do occasionally look in my rear view mirror to make sure i 'm not being tailed by a motorbike , ' he says with a wry smile			0
' but it 's not something we can afford to give too much thought to			0
' buoyed by the runaway success of the online petition , the key objective of the @entity101 and its supporters is to persuade the @entity2 military government to bring in laws that act as a deterrent against the snatching of dogs to be sold into the dog meat industry			1
under treatment : a rescued dog is treated at the @entity101 clinic in @entity209 , @entity2 after being beaten about the head by smugglers currently , the highest penalty for animal cruelty in @entity2 is a £ 20 fine			1
@entity205 and his supporters want that replaced by a tougher new law that would carry a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of £ 400 – still low by international standards			0
the petition being circulated with the video appeal calls on the @entity2 government to clamp down on the trade by making the eating of dogs , the skinning of dogs and the trafficking of dogs illegal			1
it also highlights the danger to humans of the unregulated trade from dogs that may be carrying rabies and can spread diseases such as cholera and trichinellosis			0
' this is n't only about animal welfare – it 's about human welfare , ' said @entity205			0
in the meantime , the war against the smuggling gangs remains in the hands of a small but determined group of people including the indomitable mrs @entity104 who insists she will never give in to the gangsters behind the trade			0
' it is the pain in the eyes of the dogs we rescue from the smugglers that motivates me to carry on , ' she said			2
' no animal should ever have to endure that kind of brutality			0

traders snatch pet dogs from owners and drag them through the streets
gangsters then club them *unconscious* and force them into tiny cages
dogs boiled alive then skinned for luxury dishes to help mens ' *sex* lives
but in the jungles of @entity2 brave woman campaigner is making a stand
she risks her life to take on gang *masters* making millions from cruelty
we witness how police battle traders to rescue mans ' best friend
