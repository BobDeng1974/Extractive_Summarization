a bus - sized satellite that is lost in space could break up and spark a devastating field of debris similar to that which hit @entity7 and @entity8 in the film gravity			1
the threat comes from the nine - metre wide @entity12 satellite which lost contact with @entity14 in 2012 and now orbits under at an altitude of 491 miles ( 790km )			1
scientists believe there is a chance of collision with other satellites and debris during the 150 years it is expected to remain in space			2
but bringing the satellite back to @entity14 may prove too costly			1
a satellite which the @entity24 lost contact with in 2012 could create a similar cloud of space debris which hit the @entity28 in the film ' gravity ' each year , scientists believe two objects pass the 18,000lb satellite by within about 200m and other spacecraft have had to move out of @entity12 ’s path			1
it is possible that a collision with @entity12 could lead to a chain reaction effect , known as the @entity39 , which refers to when a cloud of fast - moving debris causes other collisions			1
this is the type of a cloud that hit @entity7 and @entity8 during a spacewalk outside the @entity28 in the film gravity			0
‘ the fact that @entity12 is in a near - polar orbit does n’t help , since its path intersects most satellites ’ orbits nearly at right angles , ’ said professor @entity52 , director of the @entity54 ’s @entity53			0
@entity12 was originally designed to snap high - resolution photos of @entity14 for five years , but managed to last 10 years during its successful mission in march 2002 , the @entity24 launched @entity12 , an advanced polar - orbiting earth observation satellite which provided measurements of the atmosphere , ocean , land , and ice			1

@entity12 lost contact with @entity14 in 2012 and now orbits under at an altitude of 491 miles ( 790km )			1
this altitude is where the greatest amount of space debris around the planet is found			0
‘ imagine driving down the motorway and every so often a large truck cuts right across all four lanes right in front of you			0
’ physics students at @entity54 claim it could make it difficult for future space missions to pass through the region of @entity12 ’s altitude , if the region becomes congested with space debris			2
the fourth - year students ’ paper , @entity12 , suggests that around 140kg of fuel would be needed to move the satellite to a point where it can naturally return to @entity14 within 25 years			1
the energy required to move the satellite 90km closer to the @entity14 was 2.7 billion joules – equivalent to an extra 143.1kg of hydrazine fuel , they found			2
it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity14 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph this could be possible , according to the students , if two of the craft ’s 80kg fuel tanks were replaced			0
but getting this fuel to the satellite in orbit would be a tall order due to the costs involved of such a mission			0
an average satellite launch costs hundreds of millions of pounds – with each kilogram of the satellite ’s costing tens of thousands of pounds			0
‘ in the film , the cloud of space debris is caused by a missile which was supposed to destroy a non-operational satellite and sparks the chain reaction which eventually collides with @entity8 and @entity7 ’s spacecraft			1
in real life this is very unlikely to happen , ’ said physics student @entity116 , 22 , from @entity117			0
‘ @entity12 orbits at an altitude where the amount of debris is greatest			2
so although it is unlikely to happen , de-orbiting @entity12 is certainly worth considering			0
’ it is possible that a collision with @entity12 could lead to a chain reaction known as the @entity39 , which refers to when a cloud of fast - moving debris causes other collisions			1

bringing the satellite back down to @entity14 , however , may prove too costly
