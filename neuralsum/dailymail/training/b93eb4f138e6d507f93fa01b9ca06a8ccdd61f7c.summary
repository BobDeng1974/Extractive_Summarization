scientists found roundworm eggs in a soil sample taken from the pelvis of the skeleton of the king , which was discovered last year by archaeologists at the @entity15			1
since the body of @entity2 was found , scientists have been undertaking careful analysis of the remains , in an attempt to shed further light on the attributes and history of the controversial king			0
a team of researchers led by dr @entity27 , of the @entity28 at the @entity29 , used a powerful microscope to examine soil samples taken from the skeleton ’s pelvis and skull , as well as from the soil surrounding the grave			2
the microscope revealed multiple roundworm eggs in the soil sample taken from the pelvis , where the intestines would have been situated in life			1
however , there was no sign of eggs in soil from the skull and very few eggs in the soil that surrounded the grave , suggesting that the eggs found in the pelvis area resulted from a genuine roundworm infection during his life , rather than from external contamination by the later dumping of human waste in the area			1

roundworm infection is thought to be one of the common health conditions in the world , affecting up to a quarter of all people globally , although it is rare in @entity103 today			2
dr @entity27 said : ' our results show that @entity2 was infected with roundworms in his intestines , although no other species of intestinal parasite were present in the samples we studied			2

' we would expect nobles of this period to have eaten meats such as beef , pork and fish regularly , but there was no evidence for the eggs of the beef , pork or fish tapeworm			0
this may suggest that his food was cooked thoroughly , which would have prevented the transmission of these parasites			0
' dr @entity74 , lecturer in human bioarchaeology at the @entity15 , said : ' despite @entity2 ’s noble background , it appears that his lifestyle did not completely protect him from intestinal parasite infection , which would have been very common at the time			1
' the @entity169 for @entity2 was led by the @entity15 , working with @entity170 and in association with the @entity172 .			0

@entity29 research revealed multiple roundworm eggs in the soil sample taken from the pelvis , where the intestines would have been
the situation of the eggs suggests the king suffered a genuine roundworm infection during his life
despite @entity2 ’s social status , it appears that his lifestyle did not protect him from the intestinal parasite infection , which was common at the time
