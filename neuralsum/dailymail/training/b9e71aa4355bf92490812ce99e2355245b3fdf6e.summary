@entity7 rang around @entity8 as they yet again gave the home fans little to cheer about			0
here , @entity11 gives his ratings from the @entity14 match			0
@entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity15 – stood firm when @entity17 went clean through and made an excellent fingertip save in second half when the @entity20 threatened – 7.5 @entity21 – aggressive and tried to push @entity0 forward ; no blame could be attached to him for either goal conceded – 6.5 @entity25 – did well in the first half and , like @entity26 , could n’t be named as the reason @entity0 ended up floundering – 6 @entity4 ( left ) and @entity0 goalkeeper @entity15 ( right ) check for an offside flag for the first goal @entity26 – commanding display when the sides met at @entity33 ; not so impressive here but not the worst by any means – 6 @entity36 – did n’t give @entity2 any reason to regret not making his loan move permanent ; anonymous for most of the match – 5 @entity41 – normally assured and steady and keeps the ball ticking over but nothing of the sort here and was hauled off – 5 @entity46 – @entity48 ’s midfield , bright and energetic			2
could have done with a few more performing like that around him – 7 @entity46 gives @entity17 a kicking during the @entity14 defeat at @entity8 @entity54 – at the heart of @entity0 ’s best moments in the second half but costly error when caught in possession gave @entity2 their second goal – 6.5 @entity61 – had no impact at all ; cheers from the @entity8 when @entity5 finally took the wise decision and substituted him – 4 @entity65 – lots of running up and down the field and ran around the ball a lot but hardly touched it			0
no shots at goal – 4 @entity72 – threatened to come to life in the second period but impact fizzled out after a shot was saved by @entity76 – 6 former @entity78 player @entity61 's substitution after 59 minutes drew cheers from the fans @entity2 goalkeeper @entity76 stays alert to deny @entity0 's @entity72 ( right ) @entity81 @entity83 6 ( for @entity84 59mins ) , @entity82 5 ( for @entity85 59mins ) unused given ( gk ) , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 manager @entity91 – tried to shake things up in the second half but you get the feeling he is working with one hand behind his back – 6 new signing @entity82 came on in the second half after 59 minutes to make his debut for @entity0 @entity0 manager @entity91 has been under pressure and he reacts during the @entity14 match @entity2 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) @entity76 – struggled with ball at his feet , misjudged crosses and made some fine saves ; his season in 90 minutes – 7.5 @entity109 – this new system has enabled @entity111 to shoehorn the @entity112 into his team ; not always foot sure but is improving – 8 @entity114 – pick of @entity2 ’s defence , his efforts summed up by one sliding tackle to deny @entity72 in the second half – 7.5 @entity2 goalkeeper @entity119 pictured during the @entity14 match at @entity8 @entity121 – looks more settled now in this team ; his gait may be awkward but he did exactly what was expected of him – 6.5 @entity125 – not as impressive as he was last week at @entity127 but bright in possession , covered the hard yards and sensible in possession – 6.5 @entity131 – found his stride in recent weeks ; usual enthusiasm and prodigious work rate , his ball for @entity4 ’s goal was magnificent – 8 @entity137 – @entity111 rightly quelled talk of him joining @entity139 this week ; is playing too important a role at the moment – 7.5 @entity17 misses a good chance to make it 2 - 0 to @entity2 against @entity0 on saturday @entity4 has his shot to score the opening goal against @entity0 during the @entity14 match @entity146 – playing wing - back suits this attack - minded defender			1
unlucky to have a goal chalked off before half - time – 6.5 @entity4 – his running gave @entity2 purpose and he took his goal well but there were other moments that left something to be desired – 7 @entity17 – back from a mid-season holiday ; fluffed a glorious chance to kill the game with a lazy finish straight at @entity15 – 6.5 @entity161 – another who is getting better ; big impact and some moments , particularly in first half , were of highest quality – 8.5 @entity161 is only getting better and put in a star performance for @entity2 against @entity0 @entity4 celebrates with @entity161 ( left ) and @entity137 ( right ) after putting @entity2 1 - 0 up against @entity0 @entity81 @entity5 7 ( for @entity4 70mins ) , @entity169 6 ( for @entity170 ) , @entity171 ( for @entity17 85mins ) unused @entity173 ( gk ) , @entity172 , @entity174 manager @entity111 – when @entity2 need to change things in the second half , he did so decisively			1
introduction of @entity5 key – 7.5 @entity2 manager @entity111 ( right ) got it tactically right against @entity5 's @entity0			0
