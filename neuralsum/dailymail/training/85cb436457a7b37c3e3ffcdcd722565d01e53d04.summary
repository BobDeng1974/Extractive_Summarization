by @entity0 published : 04:06 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 09:48 est , 18 september 2012 these fascinating pictures show the first time a great white shark has been caught and tagged in @entity4 before being released back into the deep			1
a team of scientists and fishermen screwed satellite and acoustic tags on to the dangerous predator 's dorsal fin in just 15 minutes , on a platform of their former crabbing vessel in the @entity15 off @entity16 , @entity17 these will track the 2,000 - pound creature 's movements through the ocean and - along with blood and tissue samples collected - should explain some of the many mysteries surrounding the great white			1
working fast : scientists collect blood and tissue samples from a female great white shark on the research vessel @entity28 in the @entity15 researchers screw satellite and acoustic tags on to the shark 's dorsal fin , left , and expert @entity34 performs gas analysis on a blood sample moments after the 15 - foot fish was released , right shark expert @entity34 admitted he was ' nervous ' when the @entity28 crew caught the 15 - foot - long animal , because of the research organisation 's unorthodox methods			1
while other teams tag great whites using harpoons , @entity28 baits the fish and leads them on to a large platform that lifts them out of the water			1
the work is dangerous for both man and fish , with one shark dying on the lift in @entity53			1
the crew has to complete its work within just 15 minutes			1
the sharks are attracted to the ship using ' chum ' - bait made from fish parts , whale blubber and blood - which is placed a mile from the @entity28 vessel			2
smaller boats circle the area looking for great whites - and one group got lucky last thursday evening			2
feared predator : captain @entity68 places his hand on the snout of the crew 's first specimen while scientists collect samples and attach tracking devices worth the risk : @entity28 's will now be able to track ' @entity77 ' , named for famed shark researcher @entity78 they hooked the shark , leading it four miles to the 126 - foot @entity28			1
captain @entity68 guided the shark on to the wooden platform with metal sides			1
he jumped in barefoot and the lift rose out of the water until it was level with @entity28 's deck			0
the shark thrashed and bared her teeth as the water receded , curving her head and tail into the air			1
captain @entity92 threw a wet towel over her eyes and removed the two - foot hook from her mouth			0
he pumped water over her gills with two large hoses			0
the crew jumped on to the lift in jeans and long - sleeve shirts , and the clock began			2
they measured the fish - 14 feet , 8 inches and 2,292 pounds - and screwed the satellite tag , an accelerometer and an acoustic tag on to her dorsal fin with a power drill			2
researchers collected blood and tissue samples			0
time pressure : captain @entity68 streams sea water over the gills of the 2,292 - pound great white shark as it lies on the vessel 's deck while tests are carried out captain @entity92 named the female shark genie after renowned shark researcher @entity78			1
after nearly 15 minutes , everybody scrambled off as the lift was lowered back into the water			0
captain @entity92 grabbed @entity77 's tail and slowly guided her back into the ocean			0
they were done in 16 minutes flat			0
@entity77 drifted down into the dark water			0
the crew clinked beer cans and soda cups			2
' that one shark alone was worth the trip , ' said captain @entity92 , noting that she might lead researchers to breeding and birthing sites			2
' any time we tag a great white shark it adds tremendous information to what we already know , which is very little			1
' luring them in : @entity28 crew members drop chum - whale blubber and fish parts - to the bottom of the @entity15 to attract great white sharks teamwork : @entity28 captain @entity68 and co-captain @entity156 tie strips of fish to a cooler containing whale blubber and send in down to the ocean floor , left , while expedition leader @entity160 applies sunscreen before leaving the ship to check chum locations for signs of activity the crew , led by @entity160 , is mainly made up of sport fishermen and is funded by sponsors and donors			1
a previous expedition in @entity53 was the subject of the history channel 's @entity171			0
@entity28 is in @entity4 for a few weeks to help shed light on the sharks ' migration patterns , protect breeding and birthing sites , improve public safety and raise awareness about the threatened species that is a rising presence in the area			1
' we have massive knowledge gaps about how to protect their future , ' said mr @entity160			0
' i used to be nervous of what they 'd do to me , ' said co-captain @entity156			0
' now i worry that we 'll hurt them			0
' while great white sightings have risen near @entity4 , they are much more common off @entity53 or @entity191			0
mr @entity34 estimates that 30 great whites roam the @entity4 coast on any given day			0
the @entity28 crew hopes to tag five			2
bravery : the small boats used to find the elusive great whites are not much bigger than the 15ft creature itself thrilling moment : a small boat team spotted the shark last thursday evening and lured it back to their ship ' these predators keep the next lower level in check , ' said @entity208 , of @entity209 , one of the research organisations working with the @entity4 expedition			1
' it 's a system of checks and balances			0
' the great white is the ' lion of the ocean , ' keeping seal , squid and fish populations in check , mr @entity160 said			0
but it is also the shark that people are most interested in , making it a gateway for ocean conservation and advocacy , he said			2
@entity28 's real - time satellite tags last five years			1
each time sharks ' dorsal fins breaks the surface , the tags ping a satellite and mark an online map , accessible to researchers and the public			1
@entity77 has pinged several times in the waters off @entity241			0
so far , she is the crew 's only catch .			2

team attaches *microchip* tags that are detected by satellite each time the animal surfaces
shark was lifted out of the @entity15 on a platform
other crews use harpoons for tagging
brave crew ignore risks to find out more about threatened species
