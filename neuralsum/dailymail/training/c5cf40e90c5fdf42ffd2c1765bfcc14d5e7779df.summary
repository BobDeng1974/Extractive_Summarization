there are roughly 6,500 spoken languages in the world , but new research has revealed that the climate may have played a role how each one developed			2
scientists have found that humidity in different areas may have influenced the way languages evolved there			2
they found that languages with complex tones - those that use one or more contrasting tones to give meaning to words like @entity18 - tend to occur in humid regions of the world			1
this map shows the regions where languages with complex tones have developed ( red dots ) , clustered in tropical humid areas , while those languages that do not use complex tones are marked with blue dots languages with simple tones , like many @entity29 languages including @entity30 , are found in drier regions - either in the colder north or in arid deserts			1
a leading linguist claims that within a century 90 per cent of languages around the world will die out			0
ever increasing globalisation , international travel and access to the the internet is expected to lead to just 600 of the current 6,500 languages surviving			0
already more than 2,000 of the languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers , with many on the verge of dying out altogether			0
dr @entity45 , a linguist at @entity46 , said those languages that do survive will be less complicated than they are today - especially in the way they are spoken			0
lesser known cultures and their unique languages will struggle to survive , leaving widely spoken languages such as @entity30 and @entity54 to swallow them up and in turn wipe them out			0
the researchers say that this is because inhaling dry air can dehydrate the vocal cords and make them less elastic , making it harder to produce complex tones in words			1
instead languages that evolved in dry climates tend to have imprecise pitch and varying intensity			0
most @entity29 languages are thought to originate from a common ancestral tongue called @entity70 that was spoken 6,000 years ago by people living on the relatively dry @entity72 north of the @entity73			0
this dry climate may have led to the evolution of the modern non-tonal languages that exist here today , according to dr @entity77 , a linguist at the @entity78 who led the research			1
he said : ' it does not imply that languages are completely determined by climate , but that climate can , over the long haul , be one of the factors that helps shape languages			0
' more broadly , this suggests another non-conscious way in which humans have adapted to their very different and harsh environments			0
' dr @entity77 and his colleagues , whose research is published in the @entity95 , examined more than 3,700 languages			1
they found 629 languages with complex tones , with most in tropical regions throughout @entity101 and @entity102 , but also some in humid regions of @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
@entity107 , being written by the @entity109 schoolgirl in the image above , uses complex tones when spoken the humid climate in @entity112 , shown above , is thought to make the human vocal cords more adaptable languages like @entity107 , @entity115 , all of the @entity54 languages and most languages from @entity101 like @entity119 and @entity120 are considered tonal			1
languages like @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 all developed in drier and more arid climates			1
to produce speech the human vocal cords , which are a vibrating valve that chops up the airflow from the lungs , need to flex in length and tension to tune the pitch and tone			2
it is also thought to be why learning a new language can be difficult at first and require the muscles that control the vocal cords to be trained to make new sounds			2
if the new research is correct it would also suggest that people who live in drier climates may find it harder to make the sounds needed to pronounce words in tonal languages			2
dr @entity77 added : ' also , there may be some health benefits to certain sound patterns in certain climates , but more research is needed to establish that in a satisfactory way			0
' the spoken languages in @entity156 all use complex tones and are thought to have developed due to the humid climate in much of the country , particularly in the south , where the moist air helped vocal cords to be flexible			1

linguists from the @entity78 examined 3,700 different languages
they found languages with complex contrasting tones like @entity18 , @entity107 and @entity120 are mainly found in humid areas of the world
humidity makes the vocal cords more flexible and able to produce tones
non-tonal languages like @entity30 , @entity123 and @entity122 originate in drier climates where vocal cords dehydrate and become imprecise
