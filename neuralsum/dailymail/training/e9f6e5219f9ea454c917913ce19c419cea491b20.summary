@entity1 will not be prosecuted despite sending bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments , police said today			1
the payday lender was ordered last year to pay more than £ 2.6million in compensation to people who received the bogus demands			1
but @entity10 said today that , after a ' thorough review ' , it has concluded ' there is not sufficient evidence to progress a criminal investigation '			1
consumer groups and politicians believed there was clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should have pursued them through the courts			0
decision : @entity1 will not be prosecuted despite sending bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten customers who were behind on repayments , police said today @entity29 consumer affairs minister @entity28 said she was ' very surprised ' at the decision while the @entity31 , which represents around 160,000 solicitors across @entity33 and @entity34 , had demanded the police investigation			1
ms @entity28 said : ' the @entity37 seems to have enough evidence to make @entity1 pay compensation to customers for scaring them like this - why do n't the police ? ' the mp believes it is an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 @entity46 while it could also be and act of fraud			1
while the company presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with its friendly tv ad puppets , an investigation by the @entity37 last year found extensive evidence of ' thuggish ' behaviour			0
critic : @entity29 consumer affairs minister @entity28 said she was ' very surprised ' at the decision and believes what @entity1 did was illegal among @entity1 's victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage			1
the @entity37 said @entity1 sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared to be two law firms , called ' @entity71 , @entity72 & @entity73 ' and ' @entity74 ' – but these two companies were invented by @entity1 to put pressure on customers			2
in some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters			0
last june , @entity1 agreed with the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) to pay £ 2.6 million in compensation for the letters it sent to 45,000 consumers from non-existent law firms			1
but thousands of people who are in line for a payout are yet to receive their compensation offer from @entity1			2
around three - quarters of the 45,000 people impacted have received their compensation offers so far , and the company expects that the remaining quarter will have received their offers by april this year			1
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' our focus remains on putting things right for customers affected by this historic issue			2
' @entity1 is @entity107 's biggest payday lender , with more than one million active customers			1
after the compensation announcement was made last summer , the @entity10 confirmed that it would reassess whether @entity1 should be subject to a criminal investigation			1
police had discussed the case a year earlier but it was decided that the matter should be left to regulators so that compensation payouts would not be delayed			0
the statement issued by the police today said : ' the central allegations were that @entity1 had deceived its customers by sending letters falsely purporting to be from lawyers with the aim of recovering outstanding debts from customers			1
' after a thorough review of all the material gathered , the @entity10 has concluded there is not sufficient evidence to progress a criminal investigation			1
' the case , which was described by consumer campaigners as a ' shocking new low ' for the payday industry , saw @entity1 add charges to some customers ' accounts to cover administration fees for sending the letters			1
scam : @entity140 - based @entity1 , pictured , sent letters from two companies invented to put pressure on customers			2
further legal action was threatened if the debt was not repaid			0
these firms did not exist and @entity1 was using this tactic to pile the pressure on customers to pay up , the @entity37 said			2
the @entity37 could not impose a fine on @entity1 for what it described as ' unfair and misleading ' debt collection practices , which happened between october 2008 and november 2010 , because the failings were uncovered by a previous regulatory regime and it does not have powers to issue retrospective penalties			0
@entity1 has previously apologised ' unreservedly ' and has said all 45,000 customers who received correspondence from the fake law firms would be pro-actively contacted and offered a flat rate of £ 50 for distress and inconvenience and admin fees charged for the fake letters would also be refunded			1
additional compensation payments may also be made , depending on individual circumstances			0
scandal : the money lender , founded by @entity170 , has still not paid all its compensation appearing before the @entity173 last november , @entity1 's chief credit officer @entity172 set out the difficulties @entity1 had had in trying to contact customers due for compensation , saying : ' we 've had to go back a substantial way in terms of firstly the identification of those customers and then the contact with those customers			2
' @entity1 has previously said that the ' few ' people who were directly involved with sending the letters are no longer in the business			2
@entity31 chief executive @entity187 said last year : ' it seems that the intention behind @entity1 's dishonest activity was to make customers believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a genuine law firm			2
' @entity1 has undergone significant changes as a company in recent months and has said that it expects to be smaller and less profitable in the near term			0
last july it brought in the former chief executive of the @entity201 insurance group , @entity202 , to head the group , replacing founder @entity170 who had left earlier in the year			0
@entity1 has recently tightened up its lending procedures , as well as removing its adverts featuring elderly puppet characters from @entity107 tv screens			0
the payday lending industry generally has been subject to a huge clampdown after coming under the @entity37 's regulation last april			0
firms have only been granted interim permission to operate under the @entity37 's toughened regime and they will have to apply for full permission to continue operating			0
@entity1 is due to apply for full authorisation later in the year			0
payday lenders are now no longer allowed to roll over a loan more than twice and and they can make only two unsuccessful attempts to claw money back out of a borrower 's account			0
last month , the rules across the industry were tightened further , with a cap being placed on the overall cost of a payday loan as part of moves to stop such debts spiralling out of control .			0

payday lender was ordered to pay £ 2.6m after 45,000 bogus legal letters
