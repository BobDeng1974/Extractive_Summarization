astronomers have found a planet just 13 light years from @entity2 that is ripe for life , with just the right mild temperatures to allow liquid water on its surface			1
and the ‘ super-earth ’ is all the more interesting because it originated from another galaxy , meaning it could play host to extragalactic life			0
the star it orbits - @entity16 ’s star - was flung into the @entity17 when its previous galaxy was torn apart by our own			2
the red - hue colour tries to reproduce the colour of the ambient light a human might perceive on planets around such red stars the planet is one of two discovered around @entity16 ’s star			1
scientists believe it was born in a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed and destroyed by our own @entity17 galaxy			1
at only 13 light years away from @entity46 's star is the 25th nearest star to the sun. based on the data collected , the planet @entity50 is at least five times as massive as the @entity2 and it orbits the star every 48 days			1
this means the planet is warm enough for liquid water to be present on its surface			0
the second planet , @entity16 c is a more massive super-earth and quite different : its year lasts for 121 days and astronomers think it 's too cold to support liquid water			2
at the moment , only a few properties of the planets are known : approximate masses , orbital periods , and distances to the star			0
by measuring the atmosphere of these planets with next - generation instruments , scientists will try to find out whether they can bear water			0
the surviving core of the dwarf remains in the form of @entity79 , a globular cluster of very ancient stars some 16,000 light years from the sun. details of the research are published in the journal @entity86			1
' finding a stable planetary system with a potentially habitable planet orbiting one of the very nearest stars in the sky is mind blowing , ' says @entity94 co-author dr @entity93 , from the @entity95			1
' this is one more piece of evidence that nearly all stars have planets , and that potentially habitable planets in our galaxy are as common as grains of sand on a beach			1
' astronomers have calculated that @entity16 ’s star ’s planets could be 11.5 billion years old - more than twice the age of @entity2 and only about 2 billion years younger than the universe itself			1
one of the worlds , @entity113 , is five times heavier than @entity2 , making it a super-earth , and orbits in the star ’s habitable zone where conditions are mild enough to permit watery oceans			2
whether life has evolved there remains open to speculation - but given the planet ’s age it could be far more advanced than on @entity2			2
' it does make you wonder what kind of life could have evolved on those planets over such a long time , ' says dr @entity131 , one of the scientists from @entity133 involved in the discovery			2
the astronomers used new data from the @entity138 spectrometer at the @entity140 's @entity139 in @entity141 to measure tiny periodic changes in the star to find and measure the planets			0
the study also used data from the @entity147 in @entity148 ( pictured ) and the @entity150 / @entity149 in @entity141 @entity16 's star and its planets likely come from a dwarf galaxy now merged with the @entity17 ( illustrated here after the event )			1
the star is now in the vicinity of the sun but is currently moving in the opposite direction to the rotation of the other stars in our galaxy the second planet , @entity165 , is more massive than its sibling and thought to be too cold to support liquid water			0
@entity16 ’s star , a red dwarf cooler than the @entity170 , was named after @entity171 astronomer @entity16 who discovered it at the end of the 19th century			0
it can be seen in the southern constellation of @entity176 with an amateur telescope and sits in the galactic halo , an extended cloud of stars orbiting the @entity17			0
astronomers found the planets by using specialised instruments on telescopes in @entity141 and @entity148 to measure tiny ' wobbles ' of the star caused by their gravity			0
shifts in the ' colour ' of star light due to the wobbles allowed them to work out properties of the planets such as their masses and orbital periods			0
' we were surprised to find planets orbiting @entity16 ’s star , ' says dr @entity131			1
' previous data showed some moderate excess of variability , so we were looking for very short period planets when the new signals showed up loud and clear			0

a planet that may *harbour* life has been found in our sun 's neighbourhood
@entity16 b is one of two planets around a star 13 light years from @entity2
it is the first potentially habitable planet from another galaxy ever found
its star originally came from a dwarf galaxy that was destroyed by ours
and the planets might be just 2 billion years younger than the universe
@entity94 co-author dr @entity93 says the discovery is ' mind blowing '
