a group of footballers suspected of being involved in match - fixing are playing at @entity5 clubs with the knowledge of the @entity7 , @entity0 can reveal			1
following a lengthy investigation by this newspaper into alleged fixing in the @entity12 in the 2012 - 13 season , and into subsequent match - fixing in @entity15 , top officials from the @entity7 have admitted for the first time they have a ‘ watch list ’ of active players ‘ of interest ’ who , for various reasons , they can not prevent playing			1
more than a dozen alleged fixers could be playing in @entity5 , according to law enforcement and football integrity sources			1
the @entity7 will not put a figure on the number			2
in court : @entity27 watches on as he is tried for match fixing in @entity29 in 2011 the players involved are at clubs in the lower reaches of the @entity33 and in non-league football , yet their cvs show that their former employers range from leading @entity38 clubs to smaller sides across the south			1
none of the those on the watch list can be named for legal reasons ; not one has been charged or convicted with any fixing offence , hence the @entity7 ’s inability to stop them playing			1
in some cases , players were involved in games in @entity5 where betting and other evidence indicated fixing			1
a criminal investigation remains possible			0
others have been sought by police elsewhere on fixing - related matters but left for @entity5 before they could be questioned			1
watched : @entity56 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) , pictured whilst under surveillance asked to confirm the existence of the watch list , the @entity7 ’s head of football integrity , @entity59 , told @entity0 in an exclusive interview : ‘ it ’s safe to say we have procedures in place to manage those sorts of issues			1
ringleader : @entity70 , involved in the global match - fixing scam involving players at the @entity74 @entity73 ' we also have the ability within our rules , but only under certain circumstances , to interim suspend players where we believe a sufficient case can be made that they have been in breach of the integrity rules			1
’ indeed , it is understood several players have been suspended but the @entity7 will not confirm how many			1
watch list players who are not suspended have effectively been put on notice that their activities are being monitored			0
@entity59 said : ‘ in the event that we believe somebody is connected in some way [ to fixing ] we may remind them of their responsibilities			0
‘ we can seek various written confirmations from them that they have nothing they wish to share with us in terms of breaches of our rules or those of any other body or international association , and they will inform us the minute they do become aware of anything			0
’ fears of systematic fixing in @entity5 were raised in march last year when the @entity7 announced they had warned @entity12 clubs about their ‘ responsibilities ’ , after abnormal betting patterns			1
the @entity7 received a document of about 60 pages , detailing ‘ suspicious ’ matches , specific irregular wagers linked to incidents — and the names of players under suspicion			1
betting companies as well as specialist monitoring agents are among those giving the @entity7 such information			2
bookmakers stopped taking bets on matches featuring @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , and other clubs were under scrutiny			0
the @entity7 liaised with the @entity130 , and tried but failed to get a police force involved in the case			1
low - level suspected fixing was not a police priority at that time			0
scandal : @entity138 soccer players @entity139 ( centre ) and @entity141 ( right ) leave court in @entity143 the @entity7 stopped short of starting any investigation of their own			1
no player or official at any club was questioned			0
this led to the @entity7 being lambasted by , among others , their own former compliance chief @entity150 , their former chairman , @entity151 , and the chairmen of several clubs linked to ‘ dodgy ’ matches			2
@entity150 said the @entity7 had been guilty of a ‘ dereliction of duty ’ in not investigating			2
@entity151 said he was ‘ astonished ’ nobody had been questioned , insisting it was the @entity7 ’s ‘ duty ’ to do so			2
what happened next raised real concerns that not only had there been malpractice in the @entity12 , but probably systematic fixing by a major @entity164 crime syndicate			0
@entity56 @entity165 @entity167 citizen of @entity169 heritage who was jailed in june for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in @entity5 in november 2013			2
former long - term resident of north @entity174 , near @entity175 , and latterly @entity176 , he was also involved in fixing syndicate working in @entity15 last year			2
@entity57 convicted and jailed along with @entity165 of conspiracy to commit bribery relating to matches in november 2013			0
@entity181 jailed for ringleader role in @entity184 fixing and linked to @entity185 and @entity165			0
@entity185 @entity187 match - fixer , responsible for hundreds of fixed matches around the world at club and international level			0
lived in north @entity174 near @entity175 in the past			0
@entity12 2012 - 13 @entity7 made public announcement in march 2013 , reminding 22 clubs of ‘ responsibilities ’ after suspicious betting patterns , and a dossier from experts identified clubs , games and players believed to be involved in match manipulation			1
no investigation after police declined to get involved			0
@entity205 , @entity15 the biggest fixing scandal in @entity184 history unfolded a year ago at @entity74 in @entity143			0
convictions have been secured for a group of fixers controlled by a @entity187 - based syndicate , including four @entity5 players , all former @entity12 players			1
various matches in @entity5 , nov 2013 @entity165 and associate @entity57 , a @entity187 fixer , were jailed in june 2014 at @entity215 after being found guilty of a conspiracy to commit bribery in a case that centred on @entity5 football matches played in november 2013			1
both men got five years			0
up to a dozen players who played in that tainted 2012 - 13 @entity12 season , all associated to a @entity167 - based organiser for @entity164 fixers — @entity225 — were recruited by him to play at regional level in @entity15			1
four players , all @entity5 , have since been convicted of match - fixing while at a @entity143 club , @entity74 , and have been banned from football for life			1
jailed : @entity56 after being found guilty of conspiring to fix @entity5 football matches @entity56 was jailed in june for five years at @entity215 for conspiracy to fix @entity5 matches played in november 2013 — matches entirely unrelated to either the season before or @entity15			1
‘ it seems pretty clear now that there was match manipulation in @entity5 in the 2012 - 13 season , and it went uninvestigated , and some of those involved went on to be involved in @entity15 , including @entity56 , ’ said one veteran police source			1
‘ people got away with stuff in @entity5			2
some also got away with it in @entity15			0
i ’m sure the @entity7 have an idea who they are			2
’ football ’s integrity ‘ landscape ’ has changed dramatically in @entity5 even since march 2013			1
the @entity250 ( @entity250 ) , a new law enforcement agency with the appetite and power to go after fixers , has come into existence			1
it became fully operational in october 2013			0
it was an @entity250 investigation , prompted by investigative newspaper work , that led to the imprisonment of @entity56 and two associates			0
the @entity250 continue to probe other alleged fixing , and receive support from the @entity7			1
nobody at the @entity7 will publicly blame police inertia before the @entity250 was established for the lack of investigation into the suspected 2012 - 13 fixing			2
but @entity266 , the @entity7 ’s director of governance and regulation , said : ‘ these matters are now treated with the utmost seriousness by all the relevant agencies			2
we ’re a lot happier in relation to the manner in which these matters are dealt with now			0
’ the significant words are ‘ now ’ and ‘ all the relevant agencies ’			0
in relation to the 2012 - 13 season , @entity266 said the @entity7 followed every procedure they were supposed to , and could not simply start banging on doors to find answers in case they compromised a subsequent formal criminal investigation by police			2
guilty : @entity141 ( left ) was fined £ 675 and @entity139 ( right ) was fined £ 1,126 after they pleaded guilty to fixing ‘ it ’s not like in the old days when you can go in like the @entity287 and just interview some person , ’ he said			0
as well as being an @entity7 director , @entity266 is also a key figure in a ‘ tripartite organisation ’ — comprised of sports bodies , the betting industry and the police — that meets regularly to share information and discuss strategy			2
like the @entity250 , it is relatively new , and aims to tackle corruption			0
‘ we can not do it as a sport on our own , ’ said @entity266			0
‘ we have limited power , ( only ) over our participants			0
we do n’t necessarily have all of the investigative powers that other bodies have			0
so we do need their assistance			0
’ on the issue of whether the law may catch up with past fixers who are still at liberty , perhaps even playing while on the watch list , @entity7 integrity chief @entity59 added : ‘ we ’re not saying there is a big line under any case			1

more than a dozen alleged fixers could be playing in @entity5 , according to law enforcement and football integrity sources
former @entity38 players involved - but they can not be banned
