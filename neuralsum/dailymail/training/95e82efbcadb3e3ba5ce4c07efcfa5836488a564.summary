but there 's now an @entity8 version giving the alien tree a run for its money - the breath - taking 10,000 square foot wisteria vine grove in @entity14			1
these amazing photographs were captured at @entity14 's @entity17 park , home to hundreds of enchanting wisteria vines			1
' most people react in surprise when they see the @entity39 , as at first sight you would n't guess it were a real plant , ' said @entity30			2
' this is always followed by pure amazement - it 's hard to take your eyes off the wisteria when you 're standing in the fairy - tale environment			1
' @entity30 came across the park while researching online and decided he had to see it first - hand			2
magical garden : the park contains a 10,000 square foot wisteria grove which visitors can walk through with the plant dangling overhead spot the difference : the wisteria plants at the @entity17 park bear a striking resemblance to the @entity2 in the @entity3 blockbuster @entity2 , pictured he added : ' as soon as i saw images of the wisterias online , i immediately knew that i had to go and see it for myself			1
' wisterias are climbing plants related to the pea native to @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity14			0
they were imported to @entity72 in the 18th century and can be seen flowering this time of year across the country			0
through careful pruning wisteria can be ' trained ' to stand upright in a tree - form , rather than just climb up surfaces as is natural for them			1
these breath - taking photographs , also captured by photographer @entity80 , show how the vines range through a spectrum of colours from white , light pink , purple and red			0
a wall of flowers : the hanging wisteria is so thick in some parts of the @entity14 park it is impossible to see through it years in the making : @entity39 vines normally grow along walls but with pruning and the use of special poles to hold up the branches , they can be manipulated into tree shapes the park is home to hundreds of these spell - binding trees , ranging from shrubs , draped wisteria , to 260 - foot - long tunnels and are said to be the most beautiful wisterias in the world			1
' having lived in @entity14 for ten - years , i could n't believe i had n't visited before , ' said @entity30			1
' there are so many places i 'm discovering for the first time and this was just one of the ones that took my breath away			0
' i spent the entire day walking around and taking photos as various scenes caught my eye , there was so much to see			0
' photographers will always continue to visit this magical place year - after - year , just to capture the growing beauty			0
' one of the largest wisterias , known as a ' @entity125 ' in @entity14 , has been growing for 100 - years , and forms a living umbrella of leaves over visitors			2
blooming marvellous : @entity39 plants come in a variety of colours including white , pictured , light pink , purple and red			0
