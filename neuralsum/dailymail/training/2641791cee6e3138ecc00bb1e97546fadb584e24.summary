by @entity0 twelve months ago he played what he described as ‘ brain dead ’ golf at @entity4 at @entity5 and flew out of @entity6 in a suitable daze			0
‘ that was the first time i had missed out on playing at the weekend at an @entity4			0
it really did hurt , ’ said @entity8			1
this time he returns , not only as one of the favourites but with a links game to back up his status			0
always assuming he does n’t suffer one of those freaky fridays , of course			0
so far this year , @entity8 is a combined 51 under par for first rounds — and a startling nine over for the following day			1
‘ it ’s almost at the point where i am hoping for an average first day so i can go out thinking i can improve on it , ’ said the 25 - year - old			2
‘ friday on my mind ... ’ goes the old song by the @entity41 and @entity8 was honest enough to admit that ’s the problem in his case			1
‘ i definitely think it ’s got into my head and i have made it a much bigger thing than it is , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe i ’ve been putting a bit too much pressure on myself going out on fridays and trying to back up a good score on day one			0
‘ if i have no problem shooting a low one on thursday then there should n’t be any problem doing so the following day			0
‘ this week i ’ve just got to go out and get a solid start to my second round under my belt			1
hopefully , this is the week when i start to turn this friday thing around			2
’ @entity8 ’s sole victory so far this year also came in @entity64 at the @entity66 ’s flagship event at @entity67 in may			1
but for a series of poor scores on fridays a good year to this point would surely be seen in a brighter light already			2
@entity8 has shot three 63s and one 64 in opening rounds — and did not go on to win any of those events			1
improvement : @entity8 admitted he is concerned by his poor second - round scores looking up : the @entity22 is hoping to improve at @entity77 this week for @entity4 preparation : @entity8 practices his putting at @entity77 ahead of @entity4 this week this year ’s combined totals thursday 51 under friday 9 over saturday / sunday 61 under his only top - 10 @entity4 finish came at @entity82 in 2010			1
given his recent woes in the event and his second - round malaise , @entity8 will surely have been buoyed by the changing weather forecast			1
he is out early in the first round and late on friday , and the weather was supposed to turn horrid on the second afternoon			2
now the predictions are more benign			0
what happened a year ago will surely act as a spur			0
in the midst of a well - publicised slump , @entity8 shot poor rounds of 79 and 75 and came into the media area looking and sounding like a man who feared he would never play well again			1
‘ chalk and cheese , ’ is how he describes now and then			0
‘ i feel like i am going into this championship well prepared			0
i ’m playing well and i got four rounds on a good links course under my belt last week			2
’ @entity8 , who had rounds of 64 , 67 and 68 at @entity104 alongside his friday blip of 78 , will surely like the fact that @entity77 is unlikely to play like a typical @entity4 venue			1
off colour : @entity8 endured a disappointing @entity109 in @entity104 @entity110 shaped : after shooting a first round of 64 , @entity8 followed up by carding 78 in round two the winning score will be low if the wind does not blow unexpectedly and no - one puts together more scores in the mid- 60s than @entity8			1
trouble is , no - one of his ilk has more scores in the high 70s as well			1
@entity77 has crowned one @entity122 champion already in @entity123 in 1947 , and @entity8 , given the player within , is certainly overdue a run at a major			1
‘ this is the oldest one with the richest history and i ’m like everybody else , i want my name on the @entity130 one day , ’ he said			0
‘ if i was to win my third major here i would be three - quarters of the way to a career @entity133 , and not many golfers have done that			1
‘ it would be special and a huge moment in my career			2
’ time and again this year , he has been three - quarters of the way to a good 72 - hole score			2
if he can address that friday madness he can certainly get three - quarters of the way to his @entity133			0
@entity144 - day 2 highlights			0

@entity147 looking to win third major title of his career this week
@entity22 admits he is *aware* of *terrible* second - round scores
@entity8 shot first round 64 at @entity109 but followed up with a 78
