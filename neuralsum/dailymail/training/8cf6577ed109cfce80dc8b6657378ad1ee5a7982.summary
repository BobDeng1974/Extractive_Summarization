by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:44 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 16 january 2013 @entity3 peer @entity2 said that like illegal drugs , her morning coffee was not safe youngsters should be encouraged to switch from drinking alcohol to taking drugs , the head of a powerful parliamentary group said yesterday			1
@entity2 also compared taking banned substances to drinking coffee			1
the former social worker insisted some drugs are ‘ a good deal safer ’ than tobacco and alcohol and said it may be a ‘ very good thing ’ if teenagers stopped getting drunk and took some types of legal highs instead			1
her comments came the day after the @entity23 for @entity24 , of which she is chairman , called for the possession and use of heroin , ecstasy and crack cocaine to be decriminalised altogether , which would relegate it to the status of a minor driving offence			1
the report suggested that giving criminal records to young drug users creates ‘ higher levels of unemployment , homelessness and relationship problems ’			1
it also called for licences to be issued to allow chemists to sell so - called ‘ legal highs ’ , which have been blamed for causing more than 40 deaths in a single year			1
@entity2 told @entity47 ’s today programme : ‘ no drugs are completely safe			1
i have just had a cup but it is n’t safe			2
‘ the fact is some of these drugs are a good deal safer than tobacco and alcohol			2
it may be a very good thing if we could get some young people to switch from alcohol			2
‘ as you know , a lot of young people are drinking far too much			0
get them to switch to something rather safer			0
’ the cross-bench peer , who is paid up to £ 50,000 a year by the @entity69 , said many young people are ‘ determined ’ to take drugs but there was ‘ nowhere ’ for them to do so			0
if hard drugs are decriminalised users would escape with a fine , confiscation and no criminal record under existing laws users of drugs such as heroin , cocaine or ecstasy face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail , along with a criminal record , but the new report calls for a weakening of these regulations under the group ’s plan , chemists would have to show that the substances carried only an ‘ agreed low risk of harm ’			1
they would be given licences and regulated by council trading standards officers			1
yesterday , @entity2 suggested they could stock ‘ legal highs that are a substitute for ecstasy ’			1
taking drugs would remain illegal but users would escape with a fine , confiscation and no criminal record			2
the report drew an angry response from anti-drugs campaigners			0
@entity110 mp @entity109 , a member of the home affairs committee , said : ‘ it is balderdash to say that we should legalise drugs			0
we would see increased @entity117 admissions , increased criminal justice incidents as well as far more deaths and injuries			0
’ @entity121 , of @entity122 , said drugs would fall into the hands of minors if made readily available			0
she added : ‘ does she think the drug dealers will just pack up and go home ? ‘ they are criminals , they will smuggle them in and undercut the price			1
they will still target the under 18s			0
’ the @entity133 want a major review of @entity136 ’s drug laws , but the idea is being fiercely resisted by the prime minister			2
yesterday , @entity140 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ [ his ] very strong , clear view is that the approach we currently have is the right one and is working			0
’ @entity146 has held a string of public sector and quango posts in her career which have granted her significant influence over public life			0
the ex-wife of the @entity155 firebrand @entity154 , she worked as a social worker before becoming a commissioner for the @entity158 in 1987			0
she was a senior adviser to the @entity160 government on employment in the 1990s , while filling key roles on @entity164 health trusts			2
she is also a former deputy chairman of the @entity165 and chairman of the @entity167 – a hugely controversial quango which granted hundreds of illegal immigrants permission to work as bouncers .			0
