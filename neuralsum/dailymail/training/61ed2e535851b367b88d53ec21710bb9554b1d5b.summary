he divides opinion , but that 's what makes @entity3 , @entity3			1
love him , loathe him ; you can not escape him			0
but how has this bona - fide world superstar evolved over the years ? you first impression of @entity3 is that he 's an egotist			1
hugely self - confident , in similar realms to fellow @entity12 @entity11 , only with the ability to back - up his big talk			0
@entity3 trains alongside @entity16 team - mates @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 @entity3 prepares to face former manager @entity20 and @entity21 @entity3 celebrated his goal against @entity23 at the weekend by showing off his many tattoos you only need to @entity27 ' best ever @entity3 quotes ' for a sense of how highly the @entity30 rates himself			1
here are three highlights : 1			0
' in my head i am the strongest of all			0
i certainly do n't need the @entity35 to prove that i am number one			0
' - @entity3 's views after failing to make the shortlist for the 2012 award			1
' a @entity39 without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the @entity39			0
' the striker 's views after @entity45 missed out on qualifying for @entity39 2014			0
' i could n’t believe it			0
i was like " no way , @entity3 does n’t do auditions "			1
' - revealing why he turned down a trial at @entity51			1
@entity3 celebrates his goal as @entity45 beat @entity53 in november 2012 @entity3 scored a spectacular propeller kick for @entity45 against @entity53 at the age of 33 , his cockiness has n't waned			1
he knows he 's good , and is n't afraid to tell people			0
perhaps that 's why he has such a close bond with @entity20			0
they 're like two peas in pod			0
like , the @entity64 , the @entity16 striker is box office			1
but , on these shores at least , @entity3 's talents have always been under scrutiny somewhat			2
we know the potential is there - but his poor record against @entity74 clubs has always left some unanswered questions			1
of course , scoring against @entity74 opposition is n't the be all and end all of what makes a successful footballer - to suggest so would be nonsensical			2
@entity3 celebrates scoring for @entity80 against @entity51 in 2012 @entity3 has scored three goals against @entity51 - the only @entity74 side he has scored against @entity3 first came up against @entity51 back in 2006 while playing for @entity83 but for those who do not follow the @entity86 leagues would have found it hard to give credence to @entity3 's reputation having not seen first - hand evidence			1
in 16 games against @entity74 opposition , @entity3 has found the back of net just three times - all of them against @entity51 in the @entity95			1
but then came november 14 , 2012			0
@entity53 , who brought them a largely experimental squad , travelled to @entity99 for a friendly			2
what followed was a @entity3 master class			2
four goals - including one outrageous 30 - yard propeller kick			2
@entity3 played in the first leg against @entity21 in the @entity95 last season @entity3 picked up an injury in the first leg against @entity21 last season and missed the second leg if the preceding hat - trick was n't enough to convince the most staunch @entity3 sceptics , then that goal would have won them over			1
if an @entity74 even questioned his top - level credentials , @entity3 has his defence ready to go			1
indeed , that strike has certainly changed the perception of the @entity117 in @entity53			2
there 's nothing we hate more than a loudmouth who can not justify his words			0
now , in @entity3 , we see a man that can			2
his record against @entity74 clubs still leaves a lot to be desired , however			1
he drew another blank against @entity21 in the @entity95 quarter - final last season , but he missed the second leg at @entity132 with a hamstring injury			2
@entity3 failed to score in two games against @entity135 back in 2011 the striker will have another opportunity to improve his record against @entity140 opposition tonight when @entity16 welcome the @entity141 to the @entity142			1
in addition to his lack of goals , the former @entity144 striker has only once finished on the winning team against an @entity74 club : in @entity80 's 4 - 0 win over @entity51 in 2012			1
that wo n't be of any comfort to @entity20 , though			0
he knows @entity3 's capabilities			0
so does @entity3 , of course .			0
