voting for @entity0 is about a ' state of mind ' , not policies , @entity3 will say today			1
in his first major election event , the @entity0 leader will use a speech in @entity7 to pledge to fight a ' positive ' campaign that highlights the party 's values and beliefs			1
last month , it emerged that @entity0 policy chief @entity13 had been forced to quit after falling behind on work to finish the party 's manifesto			1
@entity0 's 2010 manifesto included a number of bizarre policies , such as requiring taxi drivers to wear uniforms			1
mr @entity3 was later forced to disown it , saying it was ' drivel ' that had been written by an ' idiot '			1
he said : ' we will have a fully - costed manifesto , with policies across a range of issues			2
but i actually think people are looking for the right type of people – they are sick of the college kids of the political class who are in hock to the big corporates			0
we are different – we are unashamed to be patriotic			0
' it 's about a state of mind , an attitude			0
we are on the side of the small guy , we are on the side of patriotic people , we believe in a @entity54 that is free and independent with a proper border control policy , and people know that			0
' the three main parties launched their election campaigns six weeks ago , but mr @entity3 said voters were not yet ready to pay attention			2
and he accused them of a conspiracy of silence on immigration			0
' they have started miles too early – already they are boring the public to death , ' he said			0
' @entity70 are trying to weaponise the @entity71 , the @entity72 pretending everything in the garden is rosy – both of them barely credible			2
' neither of them is offering any solution at all to the immigration issue and its impact on jobs , schools and hospitals			0
what the people want : mr @entity3 says the party 's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies ' instead we are getting a negative , @entity93 - style campaign of personal attacks , which we are not going to have anything to do with			1
they can say what they like about me - i will turn the other cheek			0
' mr @entity3 will also make the audacious claim that @entity0 , which has meps in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 is now the only national party			1
he will attack the others as ' regional parties ' , with the @entity110 unable to break out of their southern heartlands , and @entity70 making no progress outside the north .			2

@entity0 leader @entity3 will make first big election speech in @entity7 today
general approach more *important* to supporters than policies , @entity3 says
