@entity0 has held talks with @entity3 ’s chief transfer negotiator after planning a bold double move for @entity5 and @entity6			1
the @entity8 manager met boardroom boss @entity9 after @entity3 ’s game at @entity11 on sunday and discussed the possibility of signing either , or both , of his top two targets			1
after travelling to @entity11 with first - team coach @entity15 to see @entity3 roar back from 1 - 0 down to win 4 - 1 and maintain their lead at the top of @entity19 , @entity0 outlined his transfer plans with the @entity23 club ’s top administrator			1
video : watch @entity5 's brilliant volley against @entity26 earlier this season audacious : @entity8 are in talks over a move for @entity3 midfielders @entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 scouting mission : @entity8 boss @entity0 flew to @entity32 to watch the @entity34 giants on sunday but by the time he headed back to @entity35 , he was forced to accept he would have his work cut out to entice @entity5 back to @entity37 and would have to wait until the summer to capture @entity6			1
@entity38 said @entity5 ’s departure from @entity8 18 months ago was ‘ the biggest mistake of sir @entity44 ’s career ’ , but @entity0 is clinging to the hope he can rectify it , despite the cost			2
@entity46 ’s interest and willingness to offer @entity5 a route back to his home city is likely to push the asking price beyond £ 40million			0
he is understood to favour @entity46 but has not ruled out a second spell at @entity37			0
for now , @entity3 are adamant about hanging on to him and @entity9 said : ‘ from our point of view , we do not want to sell @entity5 and , so far , we have closed the door to any possible buyer			2
’ bad move : @entity38 ( second left ) said allowing @entity5 to leave was the ' biggest mistake ' of sir @entity44 's career sadly for @entity0 , those close to @entity9 fully expect him to resist all approaches for the likes of @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity61 and striker @entity62 during the january window but be more receptive to overtures in the summer , particularly for @entity65			1
it has also emerged that @entity0 fared little better in his efforts to off - load fringe players			1
@entity3 remain keen on @entity69 but are being deterred not by his hamstring injury but the asking price of between £ 16m and £ 18m			2
they will offer only half as much			0
@entity73 are discussing a loan option for midfielder @entity75 , with a view to a £ 5.4m deal in the summer			0
full back @entity78 is also attracting interest from @entity32 but he could be heading to @entity80 after being targeted by @entity81			0
on the move : @entity75 ( right ) could be on his way to @entity73 big offer : @entity85 are set to offer @entity86 a huge amount of money to sign for them in the summer meanwhile , @entity90 have joined @entity85 in bidding to sign @entity86 on a free transfer this summer			2
@entity92 revealed on monday that @entity85 will offer the @entity8 defender up to £ 3.4million a season after tax and a four - year contract			0
