by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:15 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 05:41 est , 8 may 2012 failing to kick radical cleric @entity3 out of the country has cost taxpayers at least £ 3million , figures have revealed			1
the huge bill , which has been run up over more than a decade since he was first arrested , is more than twice earlier estimates			1
the revelation comes ahead of tomorrow ’s ruling by @entity12 judges on whether @entity14 ’s appeal against deportation should be allowed to go ahead			1
laughing at @entity17 ' justice ' : @entity14 smirks as he is arrested earlier this month if his case is accepted by the @entity21 , it is likely to prompt a fresh bid for him to be released on bail			1
the issue for the panel of five judges meeting in @entity28 tomorrow is whether @entity14 ’s appeal was lodged in time and should now be heard by the court ’s @entity21			2
last week the @entity32 confirmed the running total of its legal bill for trying to deport @entity14 , a @entity35 , is £ 825,000			1
it is thought the hate preacher – who has been given full access to legal aid – has run up a similar bill thwarting efforts to kick him out			1
taxpayers have also had to cover the cost of keeping @entity14 in a maximum security prison for more than eight years , at a cost of some £ 850,000			1
since 2005 , he has spent nearly a year on bail , leading to huge costs for the police and security services to make sure he does not flee			2
in addition , @entity14 and his family have been in receipt of state benefits since they arrived in @entity17 in september 1993			1
he was also given £ 2,500 in compensation by the @entity21 in 2009 for ‘ unlawful detention ’			2
@entity58 , of the @entity59 ’ @entity57 , said : ‘ taxpayers will be angry and dismayed by this latest estimate of the cost			1
‘ by blocking @entity14 ’s deportation , the @entity21 is forcing taxpayers to continue coughing up for this vile hate preacher			1
the government should be taking urgent action to bring this case to a swift and satisfactory conclusion			2
quite simply , he is not entitled to be here and we should be free to deport him			2
’ the @entity73 can also reveal the extent of @entity66 efforts to recover some of the cost of @entity14 ’s legal aid bill			1
when he was arrested , officials discovered more than £ 200,000 in his bank account			0
the money was frozen by the @entity82 and since 2009 some £ 217,286.57 has been seized			0
@entity84 affair : home secretary @entity85 ordered @entity14 's rearrest on april 17 but that is eclipsed by the amount he has cost taxpayers			1
last week immigration minister @entity91 said that since 2002 @entity32 legal costs totalled £ 825,000			1
he added : ‘ the case is ongoing and so further costs are likely to be incurred			0
’ @entity14 , 51 , is represented by @entity95 , of @entity96 , and @entity97			0
it is thought his defence costs are likely to total a similar amount			0
the cost of locking up one prisoner in a maximum security unit is estimated at £ 100,000 a year			0
@entity14 has been held in both @entity105 and @entity106 prisons			0
@entity14 was detained by @entity32 officials last month after ministers gained assurances from @entity35 which they say will allow him to be sent back for trial			0
in january the @entity21 said @entity14 could not be deported as he may be tried on the basis of evidence gained under torture			0
home secretary @entity85 ordered his re-arrest on april 17 after she was told the deadline for him to appeal to the @entity21 of the @entity28 court had passed at midnight on the 16th			0
playing the system : @entity14 has run up a huge legal bill over a decade but @entity14 ’s lawyers filed appeal papers with the court just before midnight on the 17th , claiming the @entity32 got its dates wrong			1
a panel of judges will now make a decision on whether to accept the appeal , but will not publish its reasons or indicate what the real deadline was			0
a successful appeal could mean further delays of up to two years			0
and that is likely to prompt a fresh bail appeal			0
the immigration judge who last month ruled @entity14 should stay behind bars has said he will reconsider freeing him if he thinks deportation ‘ is not imminent ’			2
@entity3 was first arrested after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001			0
in total he has spent more than eight years in jail			0
a spokesman for the @entity146 said : ‘ @entity147 has done everything in its power to ensure @entity3 contributes to his legal costs			2
' aid for @entity153 cases is only available if the applicant passes strict financial means and legal merits tests			2

family have been claiming benefits since they arrived in @entity17 in 1993
legal *battle* to avoid deportation has raged for over a decade - *funded* by taxpayers
