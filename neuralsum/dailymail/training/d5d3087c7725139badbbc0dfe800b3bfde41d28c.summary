' we are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected , ' president @entity0 said			2
no major decisions were expected at yesterday 's meeting , as none of the defense chiefs are policeymakers in their respective countries			2
representatives from @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity34 and the @entity75 were expected at the meeting			0
representatives of the @entity33 rebels currently fighting @entity4 on the ground were not expected as the meeting was for sovereign nations only			1
force : a fighter jet takes off from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier @entity85 in the @entity86 to carry out an airstrike against @entity89 targets in @entity65 and @entity33 @entity27 warplanes are seen on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier @entity85 in the @entity86 coming together : those who attended included @entity34 lt. gen. @entity92 , second from left			0
no major decisions were expected at the meeting , since the defense chiefs are not policymakers in their countries the @entity99 and @entity100 : @entity101 of @entity72 ( left ) and the @entity70 ' gen @entity102 ( right ) listen at the tuesday meeting held at @entity10 ' this meeting is to share our vision , discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead , ' a senior @entity27 official said before the meetings			1
however , one item the group did agree on was a name for the military operation , which the @entity116 is expected to announce as soon as today			1
the name will be revealed once a document covering the entire mission is published by the @entity116 's @entity119			2
tuesday 's meeting was the fourth - and largest - to occur in recent months between the nations fighting @entity4			1
the previous meetings took place in @entity67 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
so far , the president 's strategy on fighting @entity4 has been called into question at the head of the table : president @entity0 spoke at the meeting amid calls from @entity27 lawmakers to design a more targeted military strategy against the terrorist group , currently taking up large swaths of @entity33 and @entity65 referring to @entity4 , @entity137 senator @entity137 said on sunday that ' they 're winning and we 're not '			1
the @entity139 said yesterday that fighting in @entity65 's western @entity141 province had forced up to 180,000 people to flee after @entity4 , captured the city of @entity144			2
@entity145 , national security analyst at the @entity146 said the fight against @entity4 ' has n't gone badly , but it certainly had n't gone well '			2
he added that it was ' very important ' that @entity0 had to show both @entity27 and other countries that he was ' committed ' to the fight			0
president @entity0 will today meet military chiefs from around the world to discuss plans to counter the @entity89 , amid growing pressure for the @entity27 to do more to stop the terrorist group the news comes as it emerged the @entity27 will send an army headquarters to @entity65 for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the @entity89			1
the establishment of a new divisional headquarters in @entity163 will involve about 500 fighters from the @entity27 @entity165 , with the majority stationed in @entity65 , according to @entity167			0
despite being expertly trained and expensively equipped , the @entity65 army is plagued by low morale and incompetence			0
the vast majority of @entity65 territory that has fallen into @entity4 ' hands only did so because the soldiers abandoned their posts in the face of a well - organised but massively outnumbered @entity4 advance			0
in recent days @entity4 have pushed ever closer to @entity163 , seizing control of an army base in the strategic town of @entity181 , which allowed the terrorists to push towards the entire capture of @entity141 province , leaving the @entity65 capital completely surrounded .			0
