looking back at past host cities , none is more tragic than @entity12 , which hosted the 1984 @entity5			1
held in the former @entity14 , it was the first the games to be held in a communist country and more than 1,272 athletes from 49 countries took part			2
telling the tales of a war torn city , 30 years later , the remnants of the once proud @entity5 facilities are decaying and rotting - nothing but crumbling buildings over grown with weeds and marked with bullet holes and graffiti			2
ruins : a view of the disused ski jump used in the games			0
covered in rubble , the jumps are located on @entity35 , near @entity12 today people walk past the logo of the @entity38			0
facilities were destroyed and left to crumble in during war in the ' 90s which tore the former @entity14 apart beating out @entity43 and @entity44 candidate cities to host the games , @entity12 was seen as an ideal choice because there was less chance of @entity50 counties boycotting the non-aligned former @entity14			1
@entity12 was also seen as a symbol of world peace in a country synonymous with the outbreak of @entity55			1
it was also a chance for the former country to present itself to the world in the best possible light			0
while the games remain a highlight in @entity12 's history , in stark contrast to its proudest moment , eight years later the @entity60 erupted			1
a siege on @entity12 , lasting about four years , did untold damage and was the longest on a capital city in modern warfare			1
once symbols of peace , @entity12 's @entity5 facilities became a bloody battleground			1
fighters used the @entity5 site to store weaponry , while the bobsled track , located outside @entity12 on @entity78 , was used as an artillery stronghold for @entity81 - @entity80			1
today defensive holes drilled by troops remain along with graffiti			0
other facilities including the jumps remain unused and land mines remain buried in the mountains			0
with between 10,000 and 14,000 people estimated killed in the siege of @entity12 , the middle of the @entity5 arena was used as a mass cemetery			2
an abandoned judge 's room for the ski jump has been left to deteriorate in the 30 years since it was used by officials during the @entity5 the @entity5 rings can still be seen on the neglected jump which has been left to fall apart as nearby vegetation grows wild deserted facilities have become a target for vandals who have graffitied the remaining structures which sit eerily idle once used for one of the games ' highlight events , the bobsleigh is covered in moss and vegetation as it is left to decay the bobsleigh and luge tack were used after the games for @entity117 competitions , but later became a @entity81 - @entity80 artillery stronghold during the war a picture of @entity121 , the official mascot for the games at the entrance at @entity125 , the venue for figure skating a dog walks past the @entity5 snowflake logo on the wall of the @entity132 stadium , the venue of the opening ceremony for the 1984 @entity5 a view of a derelict hotel for @entity5 competitors			1
vegetation can be seen growing inside the disused building , which would have been a hub of activity another the disused judges ' room for the ski jump events			0
after years of war and neglect , the facilities are no longer useable the derelict site of @entity149 hall , which was once centre stage to the games ' most spectacular events			0
despite the building being cleared , the original flooring can still be seen in what was once a symbol of hope , the derelict medals podium at the disused ski jump has been destroyed by years of neglect			2

the 1984 @entity161 was a symbol of peace and hope
@entity50 broke out in the ' 90s , *tearing* @entity14 apart and *leaving* @entity12 under siege for years
the site was left to deteriorate , to store weapons and bury *bodies*
the site is now overrun with vegetation and a target for graffiti vandals
