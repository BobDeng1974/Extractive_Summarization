published : 15:32 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 15:32 est , 11 september 2013 @entity0 has presented a series of challenges for @entity3 , a designer who established her eponymous label only last year			1
they are learning curves , she says , that have not been helped by her relations to mega fashion magazine publishing house @entity10 , which owns titles including @entity12 and @entity13			1
mrs @entity3 , the wife of @entity14 ( an @entity15 newspaper executive and cousin of @entity18 ceo @entity17 ) , started her brand last year as an impromptu career change , inspired by her love of fashion			1
‘ i was originally a painter , i actually came out of the film world , i went to @entity27 film school and [ fashion ] really evolved from my love of color and texture , ’ she told @entity23 by phone on tuesday			2
bright spot : @entity3 's designs exhibit an uptown sensibility , and are often fabricated of bright or sequined fabrics to create a dramatic effect ( seen here in two looks from her spring 2014 collection ) ‘ i was always making clothes and people started asking me “ where did you get that dress ? ” and it really evolved from that			1
’ in the last twelve months mrs @entity3 has already placed her made - in - @entity47 designs on @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 , among others			1
@entity52 wears one of her ball gowns in the latest issue of @entity57 magazine			0
mrs @entity3 ’s line has a distinctively uptown flair , and is heavy on the kind of cocktail attire that feels at home within see - and - be - seen social circuit			1
rather than citing historical figures or artists as reference points , mrs @entity3 says that innovative textiles , predominantly sourced from @entity68 and @entity69 , are driving inspiration behind all of her work			1
‘ honestly i get inspired by fabrics , ’ she said			0
‘ i see colors and it has to shine or glow or have a fabulous texture			0
’ for fall that entails a palette of sequins , metallic taffetas , rich brocades , and assorted laces			0
their combined effect may sound overwhelming , but the collection ’s classic shapes accommodate mrs @entity3 ’s vision for textural decadence			2
on her own : @entity3 ( right ) , says that she is prepared to work hard to create a sustainable fashion business her newest collection for spring 2014 -- which debuted this week at @entity92 -- offers a smaller range of designs , these ones fabricated of candy - colored taffetas , watercolor florals , and again , more sequins			1
‘ it ’s very @entity106 , ’ she said of her label ’s overall aesthetic , referencing the mid-century @entity101 designer who found fame with a line of elegant , over-the - top clothes			2
mrs @entity3 ’s spring lookbook is modeled by family friends and relatives , which she says is ‘ so much more fun than getting these stick kind of models			2
’ ' i think as a designer , you can specialize in one area , make a name for yourself , and then expand later on ... ' while amply comfortable in the eveningwear arena , mrs @entity3 not yet found her design footing with everyday clothes			1
but to her , that is part of the plan			0
‘ i think as a designer , you can specialize in one area , make a name for yourself , and then expand later on , ’ she said of her focus on cocktail attire			0
‘ in the end it ’s about staying in the game as long as possible and getting your name out there			0
’ it ’s a task that mrs @entity3 says she is tackling all on her own			2
‘ i married into the @entity3 family … it really has n’t helped that much , we have had great media coverage but very little from @entity3 publications except @entity143 , ’ she told us			1
@entity145 stuff : looks from mrs @entity3 's fall 2013 ( @entity147 and @entity148 ) and spring 2014 ( c ) collections are filled with fabrics that she feels recall the designs of @entity151 mrs @entity3 also says that her label has taken more of an exhausting effort than she had perhaps expected			1
in @entity47 , emerging fashion designers are typically quite young , a stigma that mrs @entity3 attributes to the fact that ‘ you do need that youth to have the stamina to be able to sustain the kind of energy it takes to do this			1
’ while she would not disclose her exact age ( she did admit to being well past thirty ) , mrs @entity3 says that she has found the fashion industry to be ‘ on steroids right now			1
’ elaborating she told us : ‘ there is a lot of pressure to put out enough product and enough designs , which is why i keep this a really small enterprise right now			0
i ’d be very happy keeping it small and less commercial			0
’ her fashion week presentation , however , has attracted attention from department store buyers			0
at present , mrs @entity3 is only retailed through a handful of specialty shops			2
she says that most of her sales come through private clients			0
‘ it ’s sink or swim for me , ’ she said			0
‘ the @entity185 are very ethical — there is business and there is family and the two do n’t get combined ever , ’ she continued			0
‘ that ’s the only way to do a business			0

fashion designer @entity3 , married to a cousin of @entity10 ceo @entity17 , says that her familial *tie* to some of fashion 's biggest magazines ' has *n't* really helped all that much . '
