by @entity1 reporter the @entity4 may not leave any troops in @entity6 after december 2014 , a @entity3 official has said			1
the indications made by the @entity9 administration yesterday defies the @entity11 's view that thousands of troops may be needed to keep a lid on @entity14 and to strengthen @entity6 forces			1
the end of 2014 marks the deadline for withdrawal of @entity20 combat troop , a process which began in november 2010			0
no promises : @entity4 president @entity9 and @entity6 president @entity22 , pictured last year , will meet on friday as the @entity3 gave the first signal that it might leave no troops in @entity6 after 2014 should the @entity4 pull all @entity4 troops out of @entity6 at the end of 2014 ? previously no explicit signals have been made by the @entity4 regarding what future missions in @entity6 will be necessary and how many @entity4 troops they would require			1
the @entity4 now has 66,000 troops in @entity6 , down from a peak of about 100,000 as recently as 2010			1
‘ the @entity4 does not have an inherent objective of ` x ' number of troops in @entity6 , ’ said @entity32 , a @entity3 deputy national security adviser			1
‘ we have an objective of making sure there is no safe haven for @entity14 in @entity6 and making sure that the @entity6 government has a security force that is sufficient to ensure the stability of the @entity6 government			0
’ at stake is the risk of @entity6 's collapse and a return to the chaos of the 1990s that enabled the @entity50 to seize power and provide a haven for @entity54 's @entity14 network			0
fewer than 100 @entity14 fighters are believed to remain in @entity6 , although a larger number are just across the border in @entity59 sanctuaries			0
the force : the @entity4 currently has 66,000 troops in @entity6 and may withdraw all withing the next 24 months remain : @entity62 troops on their graduation at a @entity20 training unit , which @entity11 believes require @entity4 and @entity20 ally troops if it is to continue defense secretary @entity66 has said he foresees a need for a @entity4 counterterrorism force in @entity6 beyond 2014 , plus a contingent to train @entity6 forces			1
he is believed to favor an option that would keep about 9,000 troops in the country			0
administration officials in recent days have said they are considering a range of options for a residual @entity4 troop presence of as few as 3,000 and as many as 15,000 , with the number linked to a specific set of military - related missions like hunting down terrorists			0
asked in a conference call with reporters whether zero was now an option , @entity32 said , ‘ that would be an option we would consider			0
’ his statement could be interpreted as part of an administration negotiating strategy			0
on friday , @entity6 president @entity22 is scheduled to meet president @entity9 at the @entity3 to discuss ways of framing an enduring partnership beyond 2014			1
the two are at odds on numerous issues , including a @entity4 demand that any @entity4 troops who would remain in @entity6 after the combat mission ends be granted immunity from prosecution under @entity6 law			2
@entity22 has resisted , while emphasizing his need for large - scale @entity4 support to maintain an effective security force after 2014			2
in announcing last month in @entity106 that he had accepted @entity9 's invitation to visit this week , @entity22 made plain his objectives			2
‘ give us a good army , a good air force and a capability to project @entity6 interests in the region , ’ @entity22 said , and he would gladly reciprocate by easing the path to legal immunity for @entity4 troops			1
@entity22 is scheduled to meet thursday with @entity66 at the @entity11 and with secretary of state @entity118 at the @entity119			2
without explicitly mentioning immunity for @entity4 troops , @entity9 's top @entity3 military adviser on @entity6 , @entity121 , told reporters tuesday that the @entity6 will have to give the @entity4 certain ‘ authorities ’ if it wants @entity4 troops to remain			1
‘ as we know from our @entity128 experience , if there are no authorities granted by the sovereign state , then there 's not room for a follow - on @entity4 military mission , ’ @entity121 said			0
he was referring to 2011 negotiations with @entity128 that ended with no agreement to grant legal immunity to @entity4 troops who would have stayed to help train @entity128 forces			2
as a result , no @entity4 troops remain in @entity128			0
@entity140 , a former commander of @entity4 forces in @entity6 and now a senior fellow at the @entity143 , wrote earlier this week that vigorous debate has been under way inside the administration on a ‘ minimalist approach ’ for post- 2014 @entity6			1
stay or go : although @entity20 have pledged to remove all combat troops from @entity6 it it yet unknown how many will be required to stay to train local forces and keep @entity14 at bay in an opinion piece for @entity154 on monday , @entity140 said the ‘ zero option ’ was less than optimal but ‘ not necessarily an untenable one			2
’ without what he called the stabilizing influence of @entity4 troops , @entity140 cautioned that @entity6 could ‘ slip back into chaos			2
’ @entity32 said @entity9 is focused on two main outcomes in @entity6 : ensuring that the country does not revert to being the @entity14 haven it was prior to sept. 11 , 2001 , and getting the government to the point where it can defend itself			0
‘ that 's what guides us , and that 's what causes us to look for different potential troop numbers - or not having potential troops in the country , ’ @entity32 said			0
he predicted that @entity9 and @entity22 would come to no concrete conclusions on international military missions in @entity6 beyond 2014 , and he said it likely would be months before @entity9 decides how many @entity4 troops - if any - he wants to keep there			1
@entity32 said @entity9 remains committed to further reducing the @entity4 military presence this year , although the pace of that withdrawal will not be decided for a few months			0
last year the @entity4 military pulled 23,000 troops out of @entity6 on @entity9 's orders .			1
