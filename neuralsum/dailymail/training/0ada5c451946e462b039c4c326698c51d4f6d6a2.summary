the only complaint @entity1 could possibly have after this astonishingly one - sided contest was the fact that there was so little to complain about			0
not a hint of controversy			0
not a booking he could blame on a referee			0
barely a misplaced pass that might have given him an excuse to criticise one of his players			0
it was , @entity1 was moved to declare , a perfect performance from his @entity18 side ; a ‘ perfect game ’ with no possible reason to cry conspiracy or point to an ongoing campaign against his team			2
he could not even moan about @entity26 ’s transfer to @entity27 when the absence of the @entity30 striker was clearly to @entity18 ’s advantage			2

instead , a stunned @entity38 witnessed @entity18 returning to the campaign that remains @entity1 ’s true focus beyond the diversionary tactics of his recent outbursts ; the campaign to propel his side back to the summit of the @entity112 game			2
however strong @entity27 might be , @entity18 will be hard to stop on this evidence			2
this time two first - half goals apiece for @entity33 and @entity47 and a further second - half strike from @entity57 secured three more points , with some quite extraordinary defensive errors contributing to @entity40 ’s demise			1
but to suggest simply that @entity40 were the architects of their own downfall would be to seriously undervalue just how wonderful a performance this was from the @entity54 leaders			0
‘ horrible ’ was how @entity124 described a first 45 minutes he rated their worst of the season			0

the manager was invited to praise @entity47 and @entity33 afterwards but he quite rightly pointed to the fact that every player in the side deserved praise			1
he mentioned @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity78 in response but he could just have easily pointed to the commanding midfield display of @entity83 and @entity82			0
the finishing of @entity33 and @entity47 was nevertheless superb			1
the opening @entity18 goal , scored after just 49 seconds , might have owed much to @entity66 ’s wayward pass — one seemingly intended for @entity39 but one that was diverted into the path of @entity33 when it struck @entity65 — but it remained a marvellous strike			1
there was the briefest glimpse of a riposte when @entity66 sent a shot crashing against the angle of post and crossbar in the second minute but after that @entity40 pretty much folded			0
when @entity83 , so composed and confident alongside the marvellous @entity82 , executed a delightful one - two with @entity85 before feeding the ball into @entity47 , goal number two arrived in the 20th minute			1
@entity47 , much like @entity33 , produced a fierce , low finish @entity43 was powerless to stop			2
@entity18 were so in control , with @entity85 seeing one shot bounce off a post and another rebound off the crossbar			2
but when @entity61 contrived in the 34th minute to knock a back - pass into the path of @entity47 , the @entity177 extended @entity18 ’s lead with another deadly strike			1

this time @entity85 sparked the move with a burst from midfield and a delightful pass out to @entity47 on the right flank , with @entity47 then delivering to the ball into the path of a rapidly advancing @entity33 and so inviting the @entity35 to smash it home			1
he did so with ease			0
it enabled @entity18 to stroll through the second half , even if there was a moment when @entity47 and @entity39 threatened to become embroiled in an ugly exchange			2
but it remained a game without controversy and without much of a fight from the hosts			0
with one eye on tuesday ’s @entity215 encounter at @entity216 , @entity1 eventually made changes			0
but a fifth @entity18 goal , scored in the 79th minute , still came , with @entity219 and @entity78 inviting @entity57 to compound @entity40 ’s misery from close range			1

@entity35 midfielder @entity33 opened the scoring for @entity18 in the first minute of play
@entity47 then added a second goal for the @entity241 in the 20th minute and a third in the 34th
@entity33 scored his second , and @entity18 's fourth in the 36th minute to *effectively* end the match as a contest
@entity248 *international* @entity57 then completed the rout with a goal in the 79th minute
