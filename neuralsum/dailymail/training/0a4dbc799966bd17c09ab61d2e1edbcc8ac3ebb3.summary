' i went into the woods and looked down and thought , " that 's a funny - looking log "			1
' it took me a second but then i noticed the markings and headed round the tree and saw the rest of the body and the head and realised it was a big snake			2
' i was surprised to say the least			0
' luckily i 'm not one of those people who is very afraid of them and he was very sluggish but it was still a shock			0
' you do n't expect to pop into the woods and see a massive snake			0
' it was lucky i did n't pee on it			0
' mr @entity9 , a retired civil servant , called the police , who informed the @entity28 of his discovery			1
the animal charity believe the snake was abandoned and is fortunate to have survived out in the cold weather			0

' he is very lucky to have survived his ordeal as the cold weather could easily have killed him			0
' @entity64 was extremely subdued and completely limp when i picked him up and we were n't sure whether he was even alive			1
