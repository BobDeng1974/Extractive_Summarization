by @entity0 as adults it 's easy to voice what we do n't enjoy eating - we can actively say we do n't want it or scrape the undesired morsel to the edge of our plate			0
for babies it is harder to voice a preference - until now			0
engineers from the @entity13 have developed the world 's first ' @entity14 ' that measures a child ’s physiological reaction to certain vegetables , fruits and spices , and in doing so gives parents an idea of what their children like - or do n't like - to munch on			1
scroll down to video engineer @entity26 , pictured , attached sensors to the feet of babies and fed them foods including mangoes , carrots and lemons			1
the @entity14 , pictured , tracked changes in each child 's @entity36			1
this response is caused by an emotional reaction to the food @entity41 2.cinnamon 3.lemon 4.coconut 5.banana @entity42 7.red pepper 8.apricot 9.sweet potato 10.carrot it uses sensors on the baby ’s feet to track changes in their @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
these responses are caused by an increase in sweat levels that change the skin ’s ability to conduct electricity			1
reponses are triggered by an emotional reaction to stimuli , which in this case were the different foods			2
the @entity14 was created by engineer @entity26 in partnership with baby food experts @entity61			2
@entity36 sensors were placed on the feet of seven babies as they sat in a highchair			1
the results were calculated by analysing increased @entity36 from certain foods , combined with facial expression and body language analysis to determine how positive the child 's response was			1
the food which produced the most positive physiological reaction in the babies was mango , pictured at the bottom of the list were foods in which the flavours are n't as distinctive as those at the top			1
this included sweet potatoes , pictured , in ninth place these sensors were then connected to the @entity14 machine which tracked micro-fluctuations in sweat levels			2
when a baby was excited by a certain food or taste , their sweat levels , and ultimately their @entity36 , increased			2
the higher the score on the @entity14 , the more excited the child was about the food , which indicated their enjoyment of it			0
@entity26 tested the babies ’ responses to banana , lemon , cinnamon , mango , coconut , papaya , red pepper , apricot , sweet potato and carrot			1
despite its sharp taste , lemon , pictured , came third in the list of top foods the babies enjoyed , according to the @entity14 results			1
@entity61 plan to use the results to improve its range of baby foods yet not all the babies had a positive reaction to lemon , as shown in this child 's reaction to the sour fruit the food which produced the most positive physiological reaction in the babies was mango , followed by cinnamon and then lemon			1
in fourth place was coconut , followed by banana and all the foods in the top five have distinctive , recognisable flavours			0
at the bottom of the list were food in which the flavours are n't as distinctive , including carrot in last place , sweet potato , apricots and red pepper			1
the flavour which got one of the most neutral reactions was papaya , in sixth place			0
@entity151 , pictured left , was the sixth most popular food in the @entity14 tests			0
at the bottom of the list were foods including carrots , in last place , sweet potatoes , apricots and red peppers , pictured right all the foods in the top five have distinctive , recognisable flavours , such as coconut , pictured , which took the fourth place spot in the @entity14 's list of foods which excited the children the most the skin , along with all tissue in the human body , can conduct a low - level of electricity			1
nerves , for example , transfer information from one part of the body to another using currents and similarly , the skin also experiences slight changes in electrical charge			0
these changes can be measured using sensors			0
a person ’s electrical conductivity can change depending on certain situations , and these changes are known as the @entity36			2
these responses are caused by sudden changes in emotion , such as excitement or fear			0
the results were calculated by analysing increased @entity36 from certain foods , combined with facial expression and body language analysis to determine how positive the response was			2
mr @entity26 said : ' @entity199 can be really exciting for babies			0
it 's an adventure from their first taste of coconut all the way through to their first piece of mango			0
when a baby becomes excited , their heart starts racing , their breathing quickens and their eyes become really large , but the things we ca n't see are the slight increases in their sweat level			0
‘ ‘ different food can stimulate different physiological responses and this innovative taste test reveals just how thrilling different vegetables , fruits and spices are for babies			0
’ @entity61 plan to use the results to improve its range of baby foods			0
other fruits the babies were given in order to gauge their emotional reaction were apricots , pictured left , and bananas , right			2
bananas scored higher on the @entity14 , in fifth place , while apricots were placed in ninth @entity61 teamed up the @entity242 to help develop its range of baby foods and drinks			1
the company makes natural , organic for babies and toddlers			0

the @entity14 measures a baby ’s reaction to certain foods and tastes
it uses sensors that track changes in their @entity36 ( @entity36 )
@entity36 measures changes in the skin ’s electric current in response to stimuli
@entity264 produced the greatest reaction in the babies , followed by cinnamon
carrots , sweet potato and apricots were at the bottom of the list
