@entity2 ’s age could help him win him an £ 8 million insurance payout over the death of @entity5 , a legal expert has claimed			1
the @entity7 singer , 71 , is not as spritely as he was and could have become overcome with grief more easily after discovering his girlfriend killed herself			0
contracts expert @entity10 said that the bar that would stop @entity2 performing would be ‘ much lower ’ than if he were a younger man			1
but @entity2 's age may affect the case he described mr @entity2 ’s age as an ‘ interesting wrinkle ’ in the case that could hand him victory			1
the stones are locked in a bitter legal battle with the 12 underwriting companies who say @entity5 ’s death is not covered by their policy because she took her own life			1
lawsuits have been filed at the @entity35 in @entity36 and in @entity37 and @entity38 and miss @entity5 ’s entire medical history could be made public if the cases go to trial			1
the papers also revealed for the first time that mr @entity2 was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder , an extreme mental reaction , when told miss @entity5 , hanged herself on march 17			1
the @entity7 say he was told by his doctor not to perform for at least 30 days whilst he dealt with the condition , which can cause nightmares and flashbacks , meaning they had to put off shows in @entity16 and @entity17			1
mr @entity10 , a visiting professor at @entity51 , told the @entity52 : ‘ the insurance contract is for his performance , not hers			0
@entity2 was ' diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder ' after @entity5 's death ‘ and given his advanced age , there 's a greater range of things that reasonably could affect his stamina , stress - level and ability to perform			1
the bar is much lower than it would be for a 21 - year - old			0
‘ this contract was about his ability to get on stage and perform demanding physical feats			2
‘ sure he 's spry and awesome for a 71 - year - old , but there 's simply a greater range of things that could prevent someone his age from performing ’			1
an autopsy confirmed miss @entity5 ’s death was ruled a suicide after she was found in her luxury @entity78 apartment			1
the designer ’s fashion business was £ 4.6 million into debt and there was speculation she and mr @entity2 had broken up , though his spokesman denied this			1
the @entity7 ’ insurance policy was for up to £ 15 million and the tour was expected to make £ 28 million			1
a clause says that if they extended it by another 14 shows to include @entity93 , which they did , then the total revenue would rise to £ 61 million			0
in the @entity35 papers , however the insurers argue that because miss @entity5 ’s death was not ‘ sudden and unforeseen ’ or ‘ beyond her control ’ they should not pay up			1
they suggest that she could have been suffering from a mental condition beforehand that played a part in her actions			0
professor @entity104 told the @entity52 that he thought the @entity7 would settle as the band would be ‘ loath ’ to hand over more personal information to the insurers ’ lawyers			2
lawyers for the insurers , who are based in @entity36 , did not return calls for comment			0
nobody for the @entity7 was available for comment			0
the disclosure is the most revealing insight yet into @entity2 ’s feelings			2
he has so far given only one brief interview about miss @entity5 ’s suicide			1
in a statement , he said he would ‘ never forget her ’ , adding : ‘ i am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way			0
’ the eight insurers are led by @entity128 and @entity129 , both based in @entity36			0
they responded by claiming that miss @entity5 ’s death was not ‘ sudden and unforeseen ’ or ‘ beyond her control ’ and so did not qualify for a payout			2
they also claimed it was ‘ reasonable to infer miss @entity5 had been suffering from a mental illness ’ that was ‘ traceable to , or accelerated by , a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention ’			2
a pre-existing condition of this kind could affect any payout			0
the insurers appeared to dispute the idea that @entity2 was so deeply upset , and claimed that the doctor who diagnosed him had not actually carried out an examination			1
they wrote : ‘ it does not appear that sir @entity2 was assessed at any time by a qualified psychiatrist or anyone else suitably qualified with sufficient expertise to make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder			1
’ court documents revealed that @entity2 has 18 people on his insurance policy , including ms @entity5 , @entity160 , seven children and four grandchildren the @entity7 frontman published a statement on his website soon after @entity5 's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life the only proof they had seen was a letter from a doctor , who was not a psychiatrist and did not actually see the patient , the papers state			1
last month , the insurers filed a lawsuit in @entity37 ’s @entity178 , and subpoenaed @entity179 , the executor of @entity5 ’s will , the @entity37 medical examiner , and @entity182 , her @entity184 assistant , in an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ‘ actual or alleged attempt at self harm by @entity191 ’ as well as her general mental health , or an ‘ actual or alleged suicide attempt ’			1
meanwhile in @entity38 , where miss @entity5 grew up , a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from miss @entity5 ’s brother , @entity199 , to find out more about her mental state			1
however , mr @entity199 told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons			0
miss @entity5 , a fashion designer and model , was 49 when her body was found in her @entity78 apartment by @entity206			2
an autopsy confirmed her death was suicide			0
her fashion business had been £ 4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at @entity213 , supposedly due to technical difficulties			0
there were also reports she and @entity2 had split up , leaving her ‘ devastated ’ , although @entity2 ’s spokesman denied this			2
documents filed at the district court in @entity221 , @entity38 , reveal miss @entity5 was on a long list of family on the @entity7 ’ insurance policy			1
also on @entity2 ’s list were his ex-wives @entity160 and @entity227 , former girlfriends , seven children and four grandchildren			2
the documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked			0
the revenue for the tour was expected to be £ 28million , and this could have gone up if 15 extra @entity93 dates were added			0
the insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy			1
a spokesman for the @entity7 declined to comment			0
lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment			0
hell - raisers : @entity246 and @entity247 the @entity7 may still be going strong , but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle			2
hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered			2
for example , and perhaps not surprisingly , the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist @entity247 related to ‘ alcohol abuse , liver failure and / or disease and osteoarthritis ’			2
more unusually , anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006 , when he was hit on the head by a coconut , will not be covered either			0
for @entity246 , anything to do with ‘ alcohol abuse ’ is also not covered			0
the exemptions for drummer @entity274 include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica			0
the documents show the band expected to receive £ 28million for their tour			0
just three shows in @entity283 were worth £ 9million .			0
