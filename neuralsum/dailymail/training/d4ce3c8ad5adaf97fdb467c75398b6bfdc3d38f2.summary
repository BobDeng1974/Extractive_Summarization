two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers			1
the expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants			0
the pregnancies are part of a revolutionary @entity11 project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family			1
the world ’s first womb swap baby , named as @entity17 , has already been delivered using an unrelated donor			1
now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother ’s womb			1
it has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers the news gives hope to @entity34 ’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the @entity37 in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb , pictured , @entity17 and his mother after his delivery the extraordinary procedure , which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant , means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family			1
dr @entity49 , of @entity50 in @entity51 , said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘ really excited ’ at seeing their babies , which are due next month			1
‘ it is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor , ’ she added			0
‘ it is a very nice gift to give to your daughter			0
’ the news gives hope to @entity34 ’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the @entity37 in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb			1
many women will have been born without the organ , others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last - ditch attempt stop life - threatening bleeding during labour			1
eventually , the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages			2
using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy			1
doctors in @entity86 and @entity87 have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth			1
teams in the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 are also keen to start their own programmes			0
the @entity11 have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had @entity100 treatment			1
late on friday night , it emerged that one had been successful – and the world ’s first womb transplant baby was delivered			1
he has been called @entity17 – a name derived from the @entity106 for ‘ to conquer ’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him			1
@entity108 ( left ) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant , said she felt ‘ humble and proud ’ to witness the birth			2
consultant gynaecologist dr @entity49 ( right ) , of @entity50 in @entity51 , said the pregnancies are going well ( left to right ) specialist surgeons @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity49 attend a news conference , at @entity50 in @entity119 , @entity11 born by c - section two months prematurely , @entity17 weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream , bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival			1
his 36 - year - old mother , who worked until the day before he was born , said : ‘ as soon as i felt this perfect baby boy on my chest , i had tears of happiness and enormous relief			2
‘ i felt like a mother the first time i touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it			2
‘ i have always had this large sorrow because i never thought i would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real			0
’ a keen athlete , she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb			2
she was able to carry her own child after a 61 - year - old friend offered to donate her womb			2
despite being long past menopause , her womb worked normally during the pregnancy			2
consultant gynaecologist dr @entity49 described @entity17 ’s birth , which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now , as ‘ breathtaking ’			1
‘ it was like having your own child			0
it was the same feeling – no one could really believe it			0
’ the doctor , who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as @entity17 ’s mother , said : ‘ i was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own			1
’ @entity17 is now back home with his parents , who have not been named			1
he is breastfeeding and growing well			0
dr @entity49 added : ‘ they are doing perfect			0
the parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child			0
’ @entity17 ’s father said : ‘ we now have the most amazing baby			1
he ’s no different from any other child , but he will have a good story to tell			2
’ @entity116 and his team performing a womb transplant in @entity51 , @entity11 the first @entity34 transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors			1
@entity179 , head of the charity @entity37 , is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval			2
some 60 potential patients have already come forward			0
but mr @entity179 , who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research , only has £ 40,000 of the £ 500,000 needed for the surgery			0
unlike the @entity11 project in which living donors are used , the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young			1
he said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman ’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life			1
he claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy			0
one of his potential patients , @entity208 , said : ‘ to feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle			0
’ the 30 - year - old , who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of @entity17 ’s birth in @entity11 , added			1
‘ it would be an absolute gift , the most amazing gift ever			0
’ mr @entity179 added : ‘ in many women , there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy			2
‘ i ’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing ? ‘ but when you meet women in this position , i know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely , it is the right thing			2
’ @entity236 , a professor in foetal medicine at @entity238 , who did ultrasound scans of @entity17 throughout the pregnancy , said : ‘ i was quite astounded that everything went so well			1
i think that ’s quite fantastic			2
’ @entity108 , who along with @entity243 of @entity244 has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant , said she felt ‘ humble and proud ’ to witness the birth			0
dr @entity108 helped remove the donor womb from the 61 - year - old woman – and transplant it in @entity17 ’s mother			1
professor @entity243 said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works , adding : ‘ it gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility , which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility			0
‘ it also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible , including if the donor is past menopause			0
’ dr @entity266 , chairman of the @entity267 , likened the operations to the first heart transplant			0
he added : ‘ i think it is quite revolutionary			0
it feels like it did when @entity100 was developed or when the first heart transplant was done in the 1960s			0
‘ it is a bit of a game - changer			0
the question is can it be done repeatedly , reliably and safely			0
’ dr @entity276 , medical director of the create fertility clinic in @entity278 , said : ‘ this is a significant medical breakthrough and i congratulate the highly - skilled team behind it			0
’ however , she said the complexity of the surgery means it will be restricted to a few specialist hospitals .			0
