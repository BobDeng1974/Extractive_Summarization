the supermarket chain 's monthly food magazine ' @entity8 ' contained a 32 - page brochure called @entity11			1
but the glossy advert , sponsored by @entity3 's @entity13 , has sparked outrage among campaigners - with some claiming it ignores what they believe is an ' apartheid regime '			1

it also includes ' market tours ' interviews with top @entity3 chefs and an article explaining ' why @entity3 wine is winning awards , plus five wines to taste			2
' recipes in the insert include shakshuka , white fish on vegetable ragu , endive salad , and ' instructions for creating the perfect falafel and hummus '			0

' activisits took to @entity71 with some vowing to boycott @entity1 - and encouraging others to follow suit			0
