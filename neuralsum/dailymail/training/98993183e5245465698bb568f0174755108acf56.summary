by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:56 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 20 november 2013 @entity3 apparently has a big mystery on its hands : the company says it does n't know why some of its turkeys would n't plump up in time for @entity9 this year			1
ceo @entity10 says it 's the first time it has happened and that the company is investigating what went wrong			0
@entity3 announced last week that it will have a limited supply of large , fresh turkeys that are 16 pounds or heavier for the holidays			1
' no answer ' : @entity3 , which produces fresh and frozen turkeys , says it has no clue why their turkeys are not gaining weight			2
the company produces one out of every five turkeys eaten on @entity9 ‘ it 's a really good question			1
we do n't have an answer yet , ’ @entity10 said when asked about the cause			0
but he noted that turkeys are ‘ biological creatures ’ subject to a variety of factors			0
‘ for whatever reason , they just did n't gain quite as well this year , ’ he said			1
like many other turkey producers , @entity3 feeds its birds antibiotics to prevent and treat illnesses , which can occur from living in cramped quarters			0
the use of antibiotics , which also promote growth in livestock , has been the subject of concern that it could lead to antibiotic - resistant germs			0
@entity3 , a privately held company based in @entity51 , @entity52 , declined to say whether it made any changes to its feed this year			2
but the problem seems to have come up rather recently			0
for much of the year , @entity3 produces turkeys that are frozen and stored until they 're ready to be sold for the holidays			1
' mystery ' : @entity3 says it is the first time its turkeys would n't plump up in time for @entity9 this year stocks cut in half : supermarket chain @entity65 said it had been notified by @entity3 that orders for fresh @entity9 turkeys across the country were cut by 50 per cent but then in october and november , it shifts into production for fresh turkeys			1
and that 's when the company ran into problems with the turkeys not gaining enough weight , @entity10 said			0
@entity3 declined to say whether the issue has been resolved or provide details on the extent of its shortage			2
but @entity65 , a supermarket chain based in @entity81 , @entity82 , said it had been notified by the company that orders across the country were cut by 50 per cent			1
@entity85 , founder of @entity86 , a @entity87 - based group that advocates for organic farming , noted that major poultry producers tightly control production factors , making @entity3 's shortage unusual			0
‘ i thought that was very mysterious			0
i could not think of a rational explanation , ’ @entity85 said , suggesting that a change in the feed formula may have been to blame			0
@entity3 's shortage should n't be a problem for most , since fresh turkeys only account for about 15 per cent of sales , with frozen turkeys making up the rest			1
@entity3 produces one out of every five turkeys eaten on @entity9			1
over at @entity103 , spokesman @entity102 says in an email that the company has never had a problem where its birds did n't put on enough weight to produce an adequate supply of large turkeys .			2
