@entity0 has been ruled out of @entity2 's clash with @entity3 , paving the way for @entity5 to make his first @entity7 start of the season			1
manager @entity9 confirmed today @entity0 has picked up a minor injury that will force him to miss the visit of @entity13 's side			2
@entity5 – who was dislodged by @entity0 as @entity9 's number one keeper – has played just 66 minutes in the @entity7 this season when he replaced the @entity16 during october 's victory over @entity18			1
@entity9 said : ' @entity0 had a little problem in training , a muscular problem , and is not available for tomorrow			1
' but it 's a chance for @entity5 and a chance for @entity50 to be on the bench			2
so i 'm more than comfortable			0
it 's a minor problem			2
' but @entity9 insists @entity5 has nothing to prove , and remains convinced the keeper will remain at @entity31 beyond next month 's transfer window			1
the manager said : ' he does n't need to prove anything to me , the club , to his team - mates , to supporters			0
he has absolutely nothing to prove			0

it 's his natural habitat to be in goal and not on the bench			0
so we are all comfortable with it			0
' that 's why , since the beginning of the season , it 's perfect for me to have @entity5 in the squad			2
' @entity5 has been linked with a move away after losing his starting spot but the manager added : ' i do n't think it 's possible ( for him to leave ) and i read his agent saying there 's no chance of leaving @entity2 in january			1
' that , plus the fact that i have no information about any offer to him , makes me believe 100 per cent that he 's staying			0
