the @entity1 government has spent $ 3million on eight inflatable boats that were intended to be used in @entity3 but never once saw water			1
the landlocked nature of @entity3 - not to mention the fact that they have been sitting in a @entity9 warehouse in @entity10 ever since they were purchased in 2010 - are two of the biggest reasons why they went unused			1
the @entity1 special inspector general for @entity15 does not specify why the boats cost so much more than their @entity1 counterparts either			2
' we do n't even have a list from ( the @entity32 ) of where they spent the money			0
we have no centralized list of where the taxpayer money went in @entity3 , ' special inspector general for @entity3 reconstruction @entity41 told @entity42			2
' it 's like you gave your credit card to your teenage daughter or son and then you just never looked at the bills			0
' the boats were originally intended to patrol the @entity50 that separates @entity3 and @entity25			2
small section : @entity3 is a landlocked nation but there is a strip of a river that separates it from @entity25 that , at one point , was considered necessary to patrol unanswered questions : similar boats ( like this one ) reportedly cost about $ 50,000 but the ones the military ordered somehow cost $ 375,000 each general @entity61 told the @entity28 reports that they were intended ' to deter smuggling and illegal entry into @entity3 ' but they did n't see much action on that front			1
@entity1 officials and @entity68 commanders deemed that the boats were not needed only nine months after they were bought without giving any specific reasons as to why , so the boats ended up staying in a warehouse in a @entity73 , @entity10 naval base			1
' the list of unanswered questions is particularly troubling given the fact ... that this program had been an important national security priority for the @entity79 prior to its cancellation , ' mr @entity41 wrote in an official letter to military officials , which was then shared with the @entity28			0
he expects the boats to be stripped for parts or ' sold for pennies on the dollar '			0
the boats are far from the only instance of an expensive budget item that went unused			0
ghost town : a two - story facility in @entity93 will now likely be demolished because @entity1 troops are being pulled out of the region , and it will be too expensive for the fledgling @entity3 army to maintain seats to fill : the command and control facility at @entity100 in southern @entity3 cost $ 34million more than $ 600million was spent on specialized aircrafts that stayed on runways in @entity103 and @entity104			1
one of the clearest signs of waste , however , was highlighted in another @entity108 report last summer , where it detailed how $ 34million was spent on a state - of - the - art building on a base in southern @entity3 that will never be used			2
the building was never be used by @entity1 troops but is too expensive for @entity3 forces to maintain , so it will be levelled as a result			1
' this is an example of what is wrong with military construction in general â€” once a project is started , it is very difficult to stop , ' mr @entity41 wrote in a scathing report released last june			0
' one senior @entity1 military official told me that this facility was designed for a military division that was never deployed and , subsequently , a decision was made not to construct the facility , but inexplicably the building construction started and is now complete			0

eight inflatable boats were ordered in 2010 but have stayed in a @entity10 naval warehouse ever since
each boat cost more than seven times the *standard* price of similar boats
@entity1 army officials and @entity68 *leaders* deemed the boats unnecessary nine months after they were purchased for $ 3million
just one of a *handful* of *multi-million* dollar purchases in @entity3 that are becoming more clear as @entity1 troops *prepare* to leave
