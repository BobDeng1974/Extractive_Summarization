published : 19:32 est , 11 may 2014 updated : 09:56 est , 12 may 2014 pensioners who require long - term care could end up paying double the much - vaunted cap on costs because there are so many hidden charges , a report claims			1
the @entity8 has pledged that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £ 72,000 – with the state stepping in to foot the bill after that			1
but the pledge does not cover the full bill for elderly care			2
cap : the @entity8 said that the cost of care would be capped at £ 72,000 among the costs not included in the cap is the ‘ bed and board ’ bill for living in a care home , which can exceed £ 10,000 a year			1
now the @entity24 has found that these hidden charges mean people will shell out an average of £ 140,000 before they reach the level of the cap			1
their research also found that only around one in ten pensioners will ever reach the point of receiving help from the state – the majority will have to bear the full costs themselves			2
they concluded that the cap has been set so high that only around 8 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women who enter care will ever reach it			2
@entity44 , one of the authors of the report , said : ‘ anyone who is expecting that the cap will pay for care is in for a shock			1
‘ the cap is there to protect against catastrophic costs , and we estimate that few people entering care aged 85 years will reach it			1
’ warning : dr @entity57 , a former government adviser , warned that people still need to save to provide for their old age the @entity8 has pledged to end @entity61 ’s care crisis , which can see the elderly facing unlimited care costs – leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year			1
the cap , which will come into force in 2016 , will be set at £ 72,000 and will cover nursing in care homes or the cost of home helps			1
after this level , the state will step in and pay the rest			0
however , it will not cover a range of costs such as bed and board , or help for those whose needs are not deemed to be ‘ substantial ’ by the council			0
people will also pay extra if they do not want to live the type of ‘ bog standard ’ home a local authority would fund			0
the study found that once these hidden charges are factored in , people would have spent an average of £ 140,000 by the time they reach the so - called cap of £ 72,000			1
mr @entity44 said many people would still have to dip into the money locked up in their property to pay for care			2
‘ recent research data shows that one in three women and one in four men aged 65 today is likely to need care , ’ he said			0
‘ yet the average disposable income for retired households was £ 18,700 in 2011/12 , which is below the level required to fund average long - term care costs before reaching the cap			1
’ he said that , even with the cap , people would have to save through their lives to pay for care , and called on more people to take out pension plans which include a care element			2
' with the right tax incentives and flexibility , there are products that could help people to meet any care needs that they may have in the future , ’ said mr @entity44			0
although the average person is expected to spend around £ 140,000 on care costs before reaching the cap , this can increase to some £ 250,000 if a person is in care for 10 years			1
there are also significant regional variations in the costs and the amount of time it will take for the cap to apply			0
in @entity140 , someone entering a care home aged 85 is expected to reach it in four years and incur a personal cost of £ 117,000 before reaching it			0
in the @entity142 however , it will take seven years to reach the cap with a personal cost of £ 170,000			0
@entity57 , a former @entity145 adviser on older people , said : ‘ the government is not going to cover the care costs for most people			1
even with the cap , most people will still end up paying all their costs			0
‘ people are not putting money aside but they need to , because society can not afford all the older people coming through			0
‘ we will all be affected by this			0
we need to make provision – the state wo n’t cover it			0
’ last night a spokesman for the @entity160 said : ‘ we are introducing the first ever cap on care to protect people from catastrophic costs and deferred payments so no one should be forced to sell their home in their lifetime			2
‘ our reforms will mean that more people will get financial help sooner			0

the @entity8 pledged nobody will pay care costs above £ 72,000
but new report claims the ' cap ' is full of hidden charges
@entity24 claim real costs will be twice as much
