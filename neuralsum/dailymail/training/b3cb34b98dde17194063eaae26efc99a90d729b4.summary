despite the unsavoury snobbery that still existed when he rose to become a @entity5 minister in 1979 , @entity6 , whose parents were @entity7 , exemplified the meritocratic nature of @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s father had arrived in this country in 1927 without much money , to work as a doctor in @entity15			2
@entity6 won a scholarship to @entity17 ’ @entity18 ( his brother sir @entity19 , a distinguished economics commentator , attended @entity20 ) , and went on to the richest and grandest of all the @entity22 colleges , @entity21 , to read law , before securing a postgraduate fellowship at @entity25			1
he immersed himself in politics , becoming president of the @entity28 and chairman of the @entity30			2
but as one of them put it to me , they all regarded @entity6 as ‘ very exceptionally able ’			1
called to the bar , he devoted his spare time to politics , becoming chairman of the @entity53 — a nursery for ambitious @entity56 politicians — and fought the unwinnable @entity58 seat of @entity59 at the 1966 and 1970 elections			2
in 1974 , after 15 rejections elsewhere , he found a safe seat and remained an mp until 1988			0
his first government job was as a @entity66 minister and he then joined the @entity67 as chief secretary to the treasury , responsible for implementing the severe spending cuts that marked the first term of the @entity35 government			1
he won great respect for the way in which he not only mastered a very complicated brief , but for the calm way in which he implemented some intensely controversial spending restraints			0
it was probably the most distinguished passage in his political career , though a decade later he would be praised for the efficiency and competence with which he completed the @entity82			0
@entity67 : after the 1983 election , still aged just 43 , @entity11 ( seated , fourth from right ) became the youngest home secretary since @entity86 in 1910 however , he was not universally liked , his occasionally shy manner coming across as arrogance or a sense of superiority , leading fellow @entity5 @entity92 to describe him as ‘ oily , loathsome ’ and ‘ without a political principle ’			1
he married late — at the age of 41 — shortly after entering government — to @entity96			2
the couple were happy for 35 years , and @entity6 became a devoted stepfather to his wife ’s daughters from a previous marriage			1
after the 1983 election , still aged just 43 , he became the youngest home secretary since @entity86 in 1910			1
his ultimate responsibility for the controversial policing of the miners ’ strike was a severe test of his presentational skills that he did not entirely pass			0
crushing blow : @entity6 , pictured in 2013 , resigned after @entity35 admitted his part in the leaking of the letter which criticised @entity112 also , at a time of @entity115 outrages , he also became unpopular with the @entity116 over his ambivalence on the death penalty			1
he was moved after two years to @entity119 — mainly because @entity35 considered him a poor communicator , but also because she was dissatisfied by the progress @entity6 had made in persuading the @entity123 not to give the ‘ oxygen of publicity ’ to @entity115 terrorists			1
within months he was embroiled in the ferocious @entity67 debate over @entity128 , a @entity130 helicopter company			0
@entity6 was admirably loyal to @entity35 , and imagined he was doing her bidding when he authorised the leaking of a letter from the @entity134 that criticised his @entity67 colleague @entity112 , the defence secretary			1
@entity112 was trying to put together a @entity137 consortium to buy @entity128 , while @entity35 backed a rescue by @entity139 , an @entity140 firm			1
furious that no one would listen to him , @entity112 resigned and stormed out of a @entity67 meeting			0
it was later disclosed that @entity6 had done more to destabilise the @entity137 deal than just authorise the leak			1
he sought to persuade two @entity130 firms in the consortium , @entity148 and @entity149 , to leave and , effectively , cripple it			0
when mrs @entity35 was forced to admit his part in the leak , @entity6 resigned , having been cut adrift by @entity151 outraged that he had put her in such a vulnerable position — but for a typically blundering performance by @entity154 , the @entity58 leader , she might have been forced from office			1
she tried to persuade @entity6 not to go , but he knew he had no other support			1
it was a crushing blow for an ambitious man , still only 46 and with , as he saw it , more glittering prizes ahead of him			0
in due course , mrs @entity35 offered him a consolation prize — one of @entity130 ’s two @entity164 ’ jobs			2
i had a rare insight into his thinking over the appointment — having coincidentally arranged to have lunch with him on the day in 1988 he had been told			0
he confided that he had serious doubts about taking the job , believing he had a future , instead , at @entity173 as a cabinet minister			0
pro-europe : serving the @entity175 for ten years , @entity6 was responsible for advancing the career of @entity177 , who , in 1994 , became one of his advisers			2
also — and it is strange to recall this now considering how fervent a @entity137 he subsequently became — he expressed profound @entity182 , saying he found the way the @entity175 did business unattractive and contrary to @entity130 interests			0
it was n’t long before he ‘ went native ’ — one of the most fervent imaginable apologists for the @entity192 , and a strong advocate of closer @entity137 integration			0
serving the @entity175 for ten years , he was responsible for advancing the career of @entity177 , who , in 1994 , became one of his advisers			0
as his last years were clouded by sordid allegations , his loyal circle of friends — many of them from @entity22 days — regarded him with admiration and affection			2
they believed the lurid claims were simply a smear , and that this elder statesman deserved better			0
whatever the truth , one thing is beyond doubt			0
but for one foolish misjudgment over the @entity128 leak , @entity6 ’s career might have been radically different , and he would have died a far more considerable figure in our politics than he was fated to be .			2

@entity6 rose through the ranks of government under @entity35
he served both as home secretary and trade and *industry* secretary
but he would go on to authorise leaking of letter that led to his resignation
loyal to @entity35 , @entity6 imagined he was doing her bidding
