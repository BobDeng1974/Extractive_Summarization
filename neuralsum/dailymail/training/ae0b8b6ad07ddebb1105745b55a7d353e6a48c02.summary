by @entity0 published : 07:32 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 6 march 2013 the @entity1 has fined @entity2 £ 485m for failing to offer consumers a choice of web browser			1
officials said the @entity8 company had broken a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure consumers had a choice of browser , rather than defaulting to @entity2 's @entity13			1
it is believed the heavy fines will act as a warning to other technology firms such as @entity18 involved in antitrust disputes with the @entity1			1
@entity20 announcing the @entity21 has fined @entity2 £ 485m ( $ 733m ) for breaking the terms of an earlier agreement to offer users a choice of internet browser @entity2 's share of the @entity29 browser market has more than halved since 2008 to 24 percent			1
@entity18 's @entity30 has a 35 percent share , followed by @entity32 with 29 percent , according to web traffic analysis company @entity33			0
an @entity1 investigation found that @entity2 had failed to honour that obligation in software issued between may 2011 and july 2012 , meaning that 15 million users were never made aware that they could choose			1
' legally binding commitments reached in antitrust decisions play a very important role in our enforcement policy , ' said @entity43 , the @entity1 's competition commissioner			1
' a failure to comply is a very serious infringement that must be sanctioned accordingly			0
' ' they must do what they committed to do or face the consequence			0
' the fine is the first time the @entity52 , the @entity1 's antitrust authority , has fined a company for non-compliance with agreed commitments			1
it could have charged @entity2 up to 10 percent of its global turnover , or as much as $ 7.9 billion			2
he said the fine was less than it might have been because @entity2 had co-operated with the investigation			0
a @entity2 spokesman said the company would respond later today			2
in all , the company has now paid a total of 2.2 billion euro ( £ 1.9 billion ) in fines to the commission since it began its first investigation into the company 's abuse of market power linked to its dominant @entity72 operating systems in 1998			2
in that respect , the fine is relatively light , but experts say it still marks a firm sanction by the @entity1 and will not go unnoticed by the likes of @entity18 , which is involved in a dispute with the @entity21 over how it ranks search engine results			1
@entity18 is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the antitrust authority moving to the next stage in the case , which could involve fines			0
other major technology firms are also in the @entity21 's crosshairs in other cases			0
@entity2 has a long and bitter relationship with the @entity1 's powerful antitrust authority , which has now issued fines totalling 2.16 billion euros against the @entity8 firm			1
internet explorer runs on all of @entity2 's devices , from desktop @entity72 computer to its new surface tablet ( pictured ) in 2004 , the @entity21 found that @entity2 had abused its dominant market position in relation to the tying of @entity100 to the @entity72 software package and imposed fines			2
then in 2009 , in order to resolve other competition concerns , @entity2 undertook to offer users a browser choice screen allowing them to download a browser other than @entity13			1
the @entity21 made that obligation legally binding for five years , until 2014 , and initially the company complied			0
from march 2010 until november 2010 , 84 million browsers were downloaded via the screen , the @entity21 said on wednesday			0
but the @entity113 service pack 1 rolled out between mid- 2011 and mid- 2012 failed to offer the choice , leading to the investigation that resulted in wednesday 's fine			2
@entity2 has said the failure was the result of a technical error and that procedures have since been tightened			0
the @entity52 has fined @entity8 giant @entity2 almost £ 500m for failing to provide clients with a choice of internet browser , as it had promised to do			1
in what was seen as an acknowledgement of the severity of the mistake , the board cut the bonus of chief executive @entity129 last year , according to company 's annual proxy filing			0
the @entity21 said it had taken into account in calculating the fine that @entity2 had cooperated by providing information that had helped speed - up the investigation			2
analysts always found it odd that @entity2 would have purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its software given that the potential fine for such a failure would far exceed any potential income from not offering it			1
@entity2 's share of the @entity29 browser market has more than halved since 2008 to 24 percent			0
@entity18 's @entity30 has a 35 percent share , followed by @entity32 with 29 percent , according to web traffic analysis company @entity33 .			0
