by @entity0 published : 08:46 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 08:47 est , 17 january 2014 @entity2 distanced himself from speculation linking @entity4 with a £ 30million move for @entity6 left back @entity7 and insisted he was fully focused on reaching a century of goals when @entity9 visit the @entity10			1
asked about reported interest in @entity7 , the city manager asked ‘ which player ? ’ before adding : ‘ no , no , no. i do n’t confirm about any names because we are not concerned about that in this moment			1
' we are just thinking about @entity9 tomorrow and not in the winter transfer window			1
during the whole of january we will see what happens , all the clubs can do transfers , but i am not interested in one name especially			2
i do n’t say nothing about it			0
@entity27 : @entity2 refused to be drawn on a potential move for @entity6 star @entity7 happy ? @entity7 ( right ) has been linked with a move to both @entity31 clubs ‘ is @entity32 leaving ? i repeat exactly the same answer , i am not talking about transfers at this moment because it is not our priority			1
‘ we will try to do a good game against @entity9 for the fans			1
so far we are doing that but every game is different			0
i remember that @entity9 lost against @entity43 in minutes 88 and 90 in @entity44 so we are not thinking that we have an easy game tomorrow			1
' we are trying to win and if we can win with more goals , it is better , but it is very important to do a very balanced game			0
’ asked about the problems caused by set - pieces in his side ’s defeat at @entity9 at the start of the season , @entity2 said : ‘ we always prepare for set - pieces			1
in every match , not only in our match , it is very important every week for all the teams			0
we will try tomorrow to concentrate a lot and not allow them to have an advantage at set - pieces			0
‘ it is great that @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 are all in a great moment			1
of course , it is better for the manager to have different choices to select			2
' they are three important players , @entity67 and @entity68 are doing really well , and @entity69 is coming back from an important injury so the three are very useful for us in this moment			1
‘ we will see tomorrow the 11 starters			0
@entity69 is in the squad list			2
he is coming from a long injury , he played just 20 minutes the other day			0
we will see which is the best way for him to continue in the next games			0
deadly duo : @entity69 and @entity67 are almost certain to feature against @entity9 him too : @entity68 bagged a brace against @entity84 in the @entity86 replay ‘ can we score 100 goals in the @entity88 ? it is always difficult to know what will happen in the future			1
we will try to play every game as a final and we will try to score the most amount of goals in every game but it is very difficult to know what will happen in the future			0
‘ we lost at @entity9 , but i do n’t agree things were not so very good for me in only the second game of the year			2
when we lost against @entity9 and after when we lost against @entity103 , we were playing in the right way and we will continue playing exactly the same because you can lose the match but i think we did n’t play bad those games			2
' it is very important to have the trust to continue in the same way and now we hope we can finish the year with an important achievement			0
