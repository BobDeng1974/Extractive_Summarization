by @entity0 published : 13:37 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 14:58 est , 7 july 2013 @entity1 today became the first @entity3 man to win @entity4 for 77 years - and the last time the trophy remained in its home country , the @entity3 was a very different place			1
the champion then was @entity9 , one of the greatest tennis players in history , with eight grand slam titles including three victories at @entity4			1
but the game - and the world - would be almost unrecognisable to the legendary player if he were still alive today			0
champions : but @entity1 and @entity9 occupied very different worlds and played a different game stylish : @entity9 was one of the greatest players of his or any era , and won eight grand slam tournaments 77 years later : @entity1 is the first @entity3 man to win @entity4 since @entity9 's victory in 1936 @entity9 , who was born in @entity24 in 1909 and died in 1995 , was a favourite of the @entity4 crowds , but was ostracised by the @entity3 tennis establishment thanks to his maverick persona			1
he was hardly typical of the tennis players of the day , being a northerner without a public school background and the son of a @entity34 mp			0
@entity9 did not even take up the sport until he was 18 having concentrated on table tennis , in which he become a world champion in 1929			1
fast around court and with a blistering forehand , he quickly rose to the top of the game			0
fitness was also a big part of his game and he often trained with @entity45			0
he became the first man ever to win all four of the grand slams , and ending up with three @entity4 titles , three wins at the @entity50 , and one each in @entity51 and @entity52 , all achieved between 1933 and 1936			2
popular : the 1930s star wowed the crowds with his dazzling play - but may have damaged tennis in the long term return : @entity9 pictured at the scene of his multiple triumphs in 1992 , three years before his death tribute : this statue to @entity9 's memory was erected in the grounds of the @entity66 born : @entity9 in @entity24 , @entity1 in @entity67 height : @entity69 , @entity1 6ft 3in weight : @entity71 , @entity1 13st 8lb started playing tennis : @entity9 aged 18 , @entity1 aged 3 @entity4 prize money : @entity9 £ 10 , @entity1 £ 1.6million favourite food : @entity9 - boiled sweets , @entity1 - sushi @entity77 slams : @entity9 8 , @entity1 2 ( so far ) @entity9 was wildly popular with tennis fans , not only for his skills but for his rakeish personality - whenever an opponent hit a good shot he would quip ' very clevah ' , often infuriating them into making a mistake			1
however , he made an enemy of the tennis authorities by opting to turn professional in 1936 , which barred him from competing in any more grand slams			2
despite @entity9 's brilliance and his contribution to boosting the sport 's popularity , he has sometimes been blamed for the dearth of @entity3 tennis success in the decades after his retirement , as young players would try to imitate his idiosyncratic playing style despite not having the talent to make a success of it			1
after his retirement , he enjoyed affairs with a series of @entity104 stars such as @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , and married four times - a stark contrast to @entity1 , who has been with his girlfriend @entity110 since he was 18			0
@entity9 had gone professional in order to earn more than the £ 10 prize for winning @entity4 , but even though he was eventually paid thousands of pounds , the millions earned by @entity1 and other top tennis players were far out of reach			1
1936 : @entity115 was already a maze of cars even though few normal people would have owned one leaders : @entity121 , left , was the @entity3 prime minister , while @entity123 's power was growing it was not just the economics of the game that were different in the 1930s - the equipment used by players bore almost no similarities to that of today			2
@entity9 used a @entity132 racket made from wood and strung with sheep 's gut , while @entity1 's is a top - of - the - range carbon - fibre model designed to maximise speed			2
should @entity1 be given a knighthood for winning @entity4 ? the wooden racket was a lot smaller , at 65 sq in compared to 98 , but nonetheless weighed more - up to 400g , compared to less than 300g for modern rackets			1
tennis balls were much softer then , as they were covered in pure wool , whereas now they are made from vulcanised rubber which is engineered to bounce in a particular way			0
it is easy to assume that modern - day athletes put a lot more preparation into their game than in the amateur era , but in fact @entity9 helped pioneer the intense training which now characterises professional sport			1
he upended the aristocratic assumption that tennis should be a contest of skill rather than power , and spent much of his time upping his fitness levels so he could outlast his opponents on the court			0
mourning : @entity165 's funeral procession passes through @entity166 following his death in january 1936 some things never change : shoppers flood the streets of @entity171 to take advantage of the 1936 sales @entity9 trained with @entity45 almost every day , and played in friendly matches for the club , giving him a more strenuous physical routine than other players of the time			1
but in some areas the 1930s game had some way to go in understanding the importance of physical condition - @entity9 loved chocolate and sweets , and could constantly be seen smoking a pipe			2
the champion would surely be aghast at @entity1 's favourite post-game snack - a plate of sushi			0
and @entity9 , like all players of the time , wore long trousers and baggy shirts , paying little heed to the aerodynamic or cooling qualities of athletic clothing			2
one link between @entity1 and @entity9 was broken in 2009 when the @entity201 star stopped wearing kit made by @entity9 , the brand founded in 1952 to cash in on the champion 's fame			0
asked what he though @entity9 might say to him ahead of the final , @entity1 quipped that would ask , ' why are you not wearing my kit ? ' however , @entity9 's son @entity213 said : ' i think my father would be proud that finally someone 's come along who 's good enough to take a shot at it			0
' landmark : @entity221 's holiday camp was founded at @entity222 in 1936 beyond the sporting world , the @entity3 of 1936 was very different to the country today			2
whereas now we are troubled by economic decline , the rise of @entity228 and rapid technological change , back then the shadow of fascism lay over @entity232			0
in 1936 @entity123 reoccupied the @entity233 , in direct contravention of the @entity235 , signalling the aggressive attitude that would lead to the outbreak of the @entity238 three years later			0
loaf of bread : then 4½p , now £ 1.32 pint of beer : then 14p , now £ 3.25 cinema ticket : then 10p , now £ 6.40 average home : then £ 550 , now £ 240,000 notwithstanding @entity9 's @entity4 victory , the biggest sporting event of the year was the @entity247 - themselves tainted by fascist politics as athletes were encouraged to salute @entity123 and the @entity251 swastika			1
the prime minister , then as now , was a conservative at the head of a coalition - @entity121 was leading the @entity256 which would last until the appointment of the wartime cabinet under @entity259 in 1940			0
politics in @entity3 was dominated by the abdication crisis which followed the death of @entity165 - his eldest son @entity260 took the throne in january but relinquished it in december in order to marry his mistress , @entity267 divorcee @entity266 , leaving his brother to be crowned as @entity269			1
it was also a year of considerable technological advances , as the @entity272 launched the first electronic television broadcasts , the @entity274 was completed in @entity267 , the speaking clock telephone service was introduced and @entity276 began producing their first cars			0
another important part of @entity3 life to date back to 1936 is the holiday camp - @entity221 opened his first establishment at @entity222 , with the 35 - shilling weekly price making it affordable to working families for the first time .			1

@entity9 won @entity4 three times before turning professional in 1936
@entity290 was adored by tennis fans but *distrusted* by the @entity293 establishment
played his tennis with a wooden racket but pioneered modern training
@entity3 in 1936 was dominated by the rise of fascism and the abdication crisis
