conman : dr @entity1 was a conman who led the high life and was chauffeur - driven in a black @entity5 posing as a member of the @entity8 royal family , he mingled with diplomats , captains of industry and senior police officers			1
dr @entity1 was chauffeur - driven in a black @entity5 and hosted sumptuous dinners at the @entity14 to mix with society ’s elite			1
but the supposedly flourishing businessman was in fact a criminal mastermind responsible for an ambitious immigration racket			1
investigators believe he helped more than 100 of his countrymen , including most of his extended family , to enter the @entity24 illegally under false and stolen identities			1
at the centre of the scam was a corrupt @entity29 worker who sold him genuine , but improperly issued , refugee passports for £ 1,500 each			1
@entity1 then used his network of security companies to give the illegal immigrants references and jobs			1
they could then ‘ hit the jackpot ’ and obtain a national insurance number , giving them full citizen ’s rights and access to state benefits			0
but the racket , which continued for up to 16 years , unravelled when the @entity29 employee was caught out			1
this week @entity1 , 55 , was starting a seven year jail sentence from august 1st , after a jury convicted him of conspiring to breach immigration laws			1
a judge at @entity50 said the charming fraudster was ' at the hub ' of a ' significant conspiracy ' to beat @entity24 border security			1
the conviction is an embarrassment for those who mixed with @entity1 , including the @entity8 ambassador and senior officers at @entity60			1
the charming conman referred to himself as ‘ his royal highness prince @entity63 ’			0
he even carried an identity card claiming to be ‘ prince of princes ’ in the @entity8 @entity65 of @entity66			0
investigators found he did not inherit the honour , but he claimed it was bestowed on him later in life , and they have been unable to disprove this			2
@entity63 at an industry convention : the supposedly flourishing businessman had several companies which included @entity77 and @entity78 and @entity79 deception : @entity1 poses outside the @entity82 station , however , this week he started a seven year jail sentence @entity1 travelled to @entity24 in the early 1980s before studying administration at @entity85 as part of a philosophy doctorate			1
he already claimed to have a degree from the now - defunct @entity89 , in @entity90 , @entity91 , long suspected as a ‘ buy - a - degree ’ college			2
he went on to set up a network of companies and claimed that at one stage they employed 900 people across @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
the core business was supplying security guards to the construction industry , including one firm based in @entity106 , @entity107			0
his companies , which included @entity77 and @entity78 and @entity79 , also provided alarm monitoring , vip bodyguards and uniformed guards for offices			0
within two decades @entity1 , a father of six , was living in a £ 1.3million home in leafy @entity114 , @entity115			1
he joined the @entity117 branch of the @entity118 and sent his daughters to fee - paying @entity120			0
but a huge investigation , which @entity1 claimed cost up to £ 10 million , unravelled his empire and exposed him as a ruthless conman			1
accomplices : @entity1 's second wife @entity125 , 46 , left , was jailed for five years and @entity126 , 42 , right , was jailed for four years for taking part in the conspiracy officials discovered a corrupt @entity29 employee based in @entity117 had improperly obtained more than 200 refugee passports			1
in genuine cases they are used as travel documents for those claiming asylum in @entity24 , often fleeing religious or political persecution			2
but the official was illicitly applying for them in the name of non-existent relatives of genuine refugees			0
at least 91 documents were posted to addresses linked to @entity1 , who ran the @entity145 chain of companies with offices across the capital			2
they were then used as the foundation for applications to remain in the @entity24 as he and his accomplices ran rings around immigration officials			1
those linked to @entity1 used every trick in the book to beat border controls , from urgent medical visas to travelling as domestic servants			2
some were so shameless that they changed their names by deed poll back to their original identities within weeks of adopting the persona of a non-existent refugee			0
among those given false identities so they could remain in @entity24 were @entity1 ’s second wife and his brother			1
after his arrest , @entity1 boasted to officials that he was allowed up to seven wives , ‘ and a few more on the side ’			2
investigators found his home stuffed with paperwork linked to his businesses , with documents in his garage filling two vans alone			0
because of the complex web of his businesses it took the @entity29 two years to prepare the case against him			2
the illegal immigrants caused chaos in @entity189 systems once they had obtained their new identities			0
one man was uncovered by his fingerprints when he was caught drink driving on two occasions , first under his real name and then in a false one			0
in some cases , illegal immigrants had already failed to gain citizenship under one name so simply adopted a new identity to try again			0
official company minutes for @entity1 ’s security companies recorded the same people attending meetings under different names			2
@entity1 's second wife @entity125 , 46 , was also convicted of conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry of persons into the @entity24 and was jailed for five years			1
their former employee @entity126 , 42 , was jailed for four years for taking part in the conspiracy , holding a refugee passport illegally and using it to obtain a driving licence fraudulently.jailing them , judge @entity210 said the scam was well organised			2
she said : ' these documents were created to order			0
each one of you was involved in deceiving the immigration authorities			0
you were at the hub of the whole enterprise			0
' the motive was @entity225 was to provide identities for employees , relatives and friends			0
it was a significant conspiracy			0
' more than 100 illegal immigrants linked to the scam have been arrested , but only a small number are believed to have been convicted and deported			0
