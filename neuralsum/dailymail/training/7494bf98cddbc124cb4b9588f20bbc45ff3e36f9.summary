leader : @entity1 , left , smiles during his 2007 trial for coercing the marriage and rape of a 14 - year - old follower to her 19 - year - old cousin in 2001 convicted pedophile and imprisoned @entity8 leader @entity1 continues to wield enormous power over two notorious polygamist towns on the @entity12 and @entity13 border he used to call home and that @entity16 residents are spied on a new lawsuit alleges			1
the @entity18 has filed a civil - rights motion against @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity13 , which claims that the @entity8 of @entity22 , of which @entity1 is the president , runs both town 's and not the elected leaders			1
as part of the lawsuit , fawning letters sent by @entity20 mayor @entity28 to @entity1 , 57 , were filed that claim to reveal how the shamed polygamous religious leader was asked for advice on who to appoint as new police chief for the town and is even assumed to have a supernatural ability to speak to @entity36			1
while the allegations of theocratic rule in @entity21 and @entity20 are not new , the two letter 's the @entity18 claim to be from @entity28 offer up the most clear - cut evidence to date of how the lines between civil and religious authority are blurred in the polygamous heart - land			2
attorneys with the @entity18 allege that members of the @entity8 prevented a @entity47 family in the twin - towns , which are collectively known as @entity49 , from getting water , engaged in questionable surveillance and kept some female members from ' escaping '			1
secretive : a woman walks ouside a large wall surrounding the compound of @entity1 's the prophet leader of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) in @entity21 , @entity13 the first letter sent by @entity28 is dated june 6th , 2012 and is covered with the instruction ' private ' over it and was delivered to the @entity60 of the @entity61 near @entity62 , @entity63 where @entity1 's is serving a sentence of life in prison plus 20 years , to be served consecutively , and a $ 10,000 fine for the sexual assault of one 12 and one 15 - year - old girl			1
@entity28 's letter begins with religious praise for @entity1 , ' as my spiritual leader i write to you today with joy and rejoicing in the lord our @entity36 , even @entity71			2
; ' it is my firm belief that you have all rights , power and ability to get the very word of @entity36 for all who desire it			0
' @entity28 's alleged letter welcomes @entity1 's suggestions on who should fill the recently retired post of chief of police as if he is in direct conversation with @entity36			1
' if the @entity75 had someone he would like to have in that position , ' @entity28 writes according to the @entity96 , ' it would be very helpful to get his sure word on who he desires to occupy that position			0
' the @entity18 lawsuit which is scheduled to go to trial on january 28th next year also includes the action of plaintiffs @entity104 and @entity105 , a @entity47 couple who believe they were actively discriminated against along religious lines			0
@entity1 , of the @entity8 , is still the leader of the polygamist @entity109 sect living in @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity13 court documents seen by the @entity96 allege direct collusion between the church and the city which would contravene the constitutional separation of state and religion			1
in a second letter sent by @entity28 to @entity1 , dated december 14th , the town 's mayor asks for @entity1 's opinion on changing the town 's charter			1
indeed , in a bizarre request , @entity28 seeks the opinion of the convicted sex offender on the prospect of minting the town 's own currency			0
in a final aside , @entity28 seeks the approval of @entity1 's in his handling of the twin city 's civil disputes before going on to add , ' i am so grateful the @entity75 has chosen you ( sic ) as his mouthpiece to all the world			2
' the letter 's were intercepted by @entity18 attorneys working with the @entity105 's own legal team			0
surveillance : ex-security members for the @entity8 in @entity21 and @entity20 allege that female members were stopped from ' escaping ' the twin - towns the worrying claims were matched by a declaration from @entity146 , who ran the @entity8 security in the twin towns until he left the church in 2010 that he met with elected officials to ' convey to them the @entity8 's view on the events ' in the two twin - towns			1
and in another unsettling development @entity146 's junior @entity154 has provided a statement to the @entity18 that claims the @entity8 security apparatus had access to and would use surveillance cameras in the two towns			2
' it is my understanding and belief that church elders and senior government officials knew of and authorized the linkage of the church surveillance system with the cities â€™ surveillance system , " @entity154 continues according to the @entity96			0
' we could also broadcast church messages over the local fiber - optic network			0
' @entity154 also alleges that he spied on the @entity174 for five years because they had become a ' threat to the church ' and that the town 's religious leaders wanted to prevent them from getting connected to the water supply and to drive them from the community			2
home : two woman talk while children stand on a car in @entity20 , @entity12 another serious allegation to emerge from the lawsuit is that church security would warn the community leaders when outside law enforcement were arriving and that they had instructions to stop female members of the @entity8 from escaping			1
' i am aware that church security was also used to keep the @entity8 ladies from getting away from the community , ' @entity154 states in court documents			0
however , @entity199 , an attorney representing the towns is adamant that the letters will not be able to authenticate the letters because @entity203 , not @entity28 , was the mayor of @entity20 at the time the letters were written			0
however , the attorney general 's office in @entity12 claims that the same man used both names .			0

new lawsuit filed in @entity12 alleges that @entity1 still wields *considerable* influence on @entity21 , @entity13 and @entity20 , @entity12 from his @entity63 prison
mayor of twin - towns , @entity213 is alleged to have sought @entity8 president @entity1 's advice on town appointments and praised him for having a direct link to @entity36
lawsuit also alleges the @entity8 uses the town 's surveillance cameras to watch residents
ex-security members allege that they were *tipped* off by the town 's elected officials to outside law enforcement arriving
female members of the @entity8 had tabs kept on them to stop them from ' escaping '
