@entity0 is being lined up for an explosive battle against @entity3 chief @entity2 in next year 's general election			1
sources claim the outgoing @entity7 leader could launch an audacious bid to steal the @entity11 minister 's seat and claim a senior coalition ' scalp '			1
the challenge would trigger a @entity15 - wide media frenzy , force the @entity11 to throw everything at the constituency and give mr @entity0 a chance to resurrect his political career after his defeat in the independence referendum			1
mr @entity0 lives on the other side of the country in @entity35 in @entity36 , however he regularly holidays in a cottage near @entity27 and plays golf at the world - renowned @entity41 course in the @entity43			2
the outgoing first minister – who will hand over to @entity45 next week - is expected to announce that he will launch a dramatic bid to return to @entity47 within days			1
the @entity48 and @entity11 have already placed their local parties in the @entity36 seat of @entity51 on a war - footing , as the @entity54 @entity53 exclusively revealed last month , with that seat still considered the most likely option by most observers			1
@entity11 grandee sir @entity58 is standing down and @entity51 covers the @entity60 constituency represented by mr @entity0 at @entity61			1
however , the @entity11 candidate is a former journalist , @entity62 , who has no public profile			2
one senior @entity65 source said : ' @entity0 wants a scalp			2
he wo n't get that in @entity51 and he has a pick of any seat			2
' mr @entity0 will officially hand over to @entity45 next week , when she becomes @entity7 leader and first minister ex-pm @entity72 would be drafted in for the general election if @entity74 becomes @entity76 leader @entity72 is set to play a major campaigning role in next year 's general election if @entity74 wins the increasingly bitter @entity76 leadership battle			1
mr @entity74 yesterday revealed he has spoken to the former prime minister as the contest to replace @entity82 intensified			0
today , his main rival @entity84 – a staunch left - winger – will launch his leadership bid with a thinly - veiled attack on career politicians			2
many in the party wanted @entity72 to take control of @entity76 , but he declined to return to frontline politics			0
however , mr @entity74 said : ' i envision @entity72 having a big part to play			0
i spoke to him at length and i would like @entity51 to have a big part in our election campaign			0
' he was so formidable during the referendum campaign and i want him to use his energy and passion again for @entity76			0
' it will be for geeing up the troops but also for convincing voters			0
@entity76 has got to come together as a team because teams win whereas divided groups lose			0
' mr @entity2 would be an easy target as mr @entity0 could blame him for the @entity48 - @entity11 austerity programme			1
latest polls suggest the @entity11 could be wiped out in nearly all their seats north of the @entity112 , except @entity54 secretary @entity116 's @entity114 and @entity115 stronghold			2
however , a @entity118 spokeswoman said : ' if the man who installed the hated average speed cameras on the @entity122 , abolished @entity123 and stood by the routine arming of police wants to run for a seat nearly 100 miles from his home , we think he should bring it on			0
people in @entity27 deserve better than being someone 's second best			0
' mr @entity0 is known to be fond of working in @entity47 , and was an mp for @entity133 and @entity134 for 23 years until 2010			1
he could return as the party 's @entity47 leader , replacing @entity137 who observers believe has already been sidelined			1
the @entity7 has not yet chosen its candidates for may 's general election			2
mr @entity0 will almost certainly not contest his old @entity133 and @entity134 seat as it already represented by the party 's @entity142			1
in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , mr @entity2 's main challenge came from @entity76 in the 2010 general election			0
but the @entity61 seat of @entity27 and @entity28 is represented by the @entity7 's @entity147 , who won in 2011 with a massive majority of nearly 10,000 , and @entity65 strategists believe they can therefore challenge mr @entity2 next may			1
the easier option for mr @entity0 would be @entity51 , where the @entity11 currently have a majority of 6,748 on a 36 per cent share of the vote			1
the @entity7 moved ahead of @entity76 and the @entity48 into second place in 2010 , and in the 2011 @entity156 , mr @entity0 was returned in @entity60 with a massive majority of 15,295			1
one @entity11 source in the area said : ' we have n't heard anything officially , but we 're expecting @entity0 to make an announcement any day			1
' but we 're confident we can beat him – he 's not as popular as he was in 2011 and the referendum saw a 60 per cent no vote in this area			0
people used to see him as invincible , but that 's not the case now			0
' he 's something of a spent force			0
' during an episode of the @entity173 show @entity172 last month , filmed in @entity174 , mr @entity0 was asked by presenter @entity175 whether he would consider a return to @entity47			1
the first minister replied : ' the answer to your question @entity181 , absolutely decisively i can tell you i have n't made up my mind			0
so you 'll have to wait and see			0
' but i tell you what , when i do make up my mind , invite me back on to @entity172 and i 'll tell you why i did it			0
' mr @entity175 asked mr @entity0 : ' so it is not a closed door ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' you can take that from what i have just told you @entity181 , that 's right ' .			2

sources claim outgoing @entity7 leader could try to steal top @entity11 's seat
it would be a major coalition ' scalp ' for the @entity7
@entity0 to hand over to @entity45 as first minister next week
he is expected to announce he will launch a bid to return to @entity47
