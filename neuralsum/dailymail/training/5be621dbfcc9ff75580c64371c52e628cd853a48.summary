by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 12:41 est , 12 march 2014 the new @entity3 campaign looks like it is going to be the wildest season i have ever seen			1
we arrive in @entity7 for the @entity9 @entity8 totally unsure of what is going to happen			2
some teams look like they will struggle to get their car to the start of the race , let alone the finish			2
exciting : @entity0 believes the 2014 @entity3 season will be the wildest one he has ever seen curtain raiser : the @entity9 @entity8 at @entity7 's @entity18 is the opening race of the 2014 @entity20 season i am pretty sure we will have a half - a - dozen crazy races where we are going to see them grappling with the fuel , the tyres , the strategy , the reliability			1
indeed , have they done enough practice starts ? what about the pit - stops ? these are the things the teams usually have under control by now , but they just did n’t complete as much testing as normal over the winter			2
last year , the teams completed 11,000 laps between them in testing , but this year they managed only 7,000 , and most of that was fundamentally getting their cars working			1
it has n’t been fine tuning their race strategy , so who knows ? if we get half the cars to the finish in @entity7 i will be impressed and surprised			1
on the mic : since retiring from @entity51 works as a broadcaster where he is currently at @entity55 blast from the past : @entity0 competed in 158 f1 races , including the 1992 @entity57 for @entity58 @entity59 have been one of the teams to struggle over the winter and in a way i am not surprised because @entity65 has always packaged his cars in an extreme way , and over the full course of time that enabled him to win a lot of championships			1
he is a purest and he does tend to push the limits which has been his success , but right now , it is giving him some headaches			2
however , i would n’t write them off at all			2
they obviously have some early gremlins going on but i suspect that underneath that , there is a very competitive race car			2
but it is whether they can find that car quickly enough , because at the moment they have clearly got a mountain to climb			0
@entity91 on the other hand have impressed in pre-season testing			0
there is a comfort zone in that , like with @entity97 and @entity98 doing well , you need @entity91 to be at the sharp end of @entity3 after all their historical success			1
they have a lot of new personnel there , and they have chosen the right engine - it looks like @entity109 is the best package - so if you put that all together with a new initiative i am not surprised in the slightest that they are looking so strong			0
if they won one or more of the first races i would not be surprised either because it is going to be about reliability			0
rocky road : @entity0 thinks it 's going to be a tough campaign for @entity123 ( right ) and his @entity59 team that said , the great drivers are always the great drivers and they will make better use of the tools available to them because they have got greater capacity to think about what is going on around them when they are in the car and out of the car			1
@entity135 would have loved these cars			1
he would have maximised all the tools and the levers that they have got available			0
legend : @entity135 won three world titles before he died racing for @entity91 at the 1994 @entity142 gp a world champion probably needs 70 per cent of his capacity to drive a car and that probably leaves 30 per cent to work out what is going on around him whereas a good driver needs 80 per cent of his capacity to drive the car for example			1
the cream always rises to the top and the great drivers will still be up front , but i think the thinking driver has got more of a chance this year			0
it wo n’t just be about pedal to the metal			0
team to beat : @entity0 believes @entity109 look the strongest outfit ahead of the 2014 @entity3 season and that their @entity165 driver @entity164 ( left ) will win his first @entity167 ' championship since 2008 mercedes look the strongest , but they are not bullet - proof either			1
you will have to think your way through the season , and we know that @entity174 is strong at that			1
you need to be acrobatic to tame these cars because they have a lot of torque and power and that is where @entity164 is strong , so i seem them both being contenders			2
the two teams who with the best chance of evolving more quickly are @entity109 and @entity189 because they are developing the engines , so @entity164 and @entity174 and the @entity189 pair of @entity192 and @entity193 should have an advantage by mid-season			0
@entity196 missed : @entity197 ( centre ) will be without his dad @entity199 ( left ) in the paddock who died in january professional : @entity0 believes @entity197 ( pictured ) will focus on the track despite the loss of his father over at @entity206 , @entity197 will feel the passing of his father @entity199 most strongly at the first race because he has been part and parcel of his racing career , but @entity197 is a professional			1
he will get in the car and he will switch all of that off			0
as a grand prix driver you are quite selfish			0
whether you have just had kids or whatever , when you turn up you get on and do the job			0
you have hundreds of people working for you and you ’re the final link in the chain so you have to get the job done and that is exactly what @entity197 will do			1
but who do i believe will win the world championship ? i would not write off @entity123 like a lot of people have done , but he has a tall order there			0
i fancy @entity230 to win his second title			0
@entity20 is the only place to watch all 19 @entity233 weekends live on tv , @entity235 and @entity234 .			0

this will be the wildest @entity3 season yet
@entity197 will remain professional despite his dad @entity241 's death
with all this *technology* @entity135 would *'ve* loved racing these cars
