@entity6 claims to provide holidaymakers with up to factor 30 protection , meaning sunbathers could be able to soak up the rays for longer without fear of getting burned			1

there are two varieties available - ' tanning ' and ' non tanning ' , the former allows users achieve a tan while being protected from harmful sun rays , the company states			2
however , the @entity18 company does admit that none of its claims have been approved by the @entity43			1
on its website , the medical skincare brand advises : ' take 2ml every 4 hours while in the sun ( preferably with 2 + oz of water )			0
' wait 1 hour before exposure to the sun. monitor sun exposure carefully			0
' take second dose if still in sun 3 hours after first dose			0
' for extended intense exercise outdoors or if taking sun - sensitizing medications , use alternate protection after 30 - 40 minutes			2
' dr @entity57 , who founded the company , adds in his blog : ' if 2 mls are ingested an hour before sun exposure , the frequencies that have been imprinted on water will vibrate on your skin in such a way as to cancel approximately 97 % of the @entity15 and uvb rays before they even hit your skin			1
' this results in coverage for approximately three hours			0
' this is similar to the amount of uv reflection created by @entity4 titanium / zinc sunblocks but distinctly better than uvb chemical sunscreens which prevent certain damage that leads to the visible / painful / inflammation reaction we identify as sun damage			0
' @entity83 is yet to be endorsed by dermatologist bodies , however , the company website does carry testimonials for the product			0

' my year and a half year old drinks it as well and has n't burned once this summer and is outside everyday ! thank you , thank you for this product ! ' @entity103 , spokesman at the @entity104 , said : ' we would advise extreme caution of any product claiming @entity15 protection using methods not supported by clinical research			1
' when it comes to an issue as serious as preventing skin cancer , customer testimonials can not take the place of scientific evidence , for which this particular product can not provide			0
' children 's skin is particularly sensitive and therefore more prone to damage from uv rays , so it is even more important to stick to the tried and tested methods of sun protection when it comes to protecting their skin			2
