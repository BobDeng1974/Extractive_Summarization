@entity0 , the doctor whose confirmed @entity2 diagnosis sent @entity3 into a tailspin on thursday , successfully cleared the @entity7 government 's newest ' enhanced ' screening protocols when he returned from @entity8			1
the @entity9 said dr @entity0 , who was in @entity10 treating @entity2 patients as part of a @entity14 team , passed inspection six days before showing symptoms and being rushed to @entity17 in @entity18			1

it was revealed today that he had also eaten at @entity100 in @entity101 and stopped at @entity102 on the @entity98 on tuesday as more cases are identified that slip through the @entity9 's screening system , the chorus of demands for banning travel to the @entity7 from affected countries will grow louder			1
