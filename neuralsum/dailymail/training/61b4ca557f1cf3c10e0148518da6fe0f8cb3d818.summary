they nicknamed her @entity1 , the grand old dame of the sea			2
she was fast in her day , shapely , ever eager to serve			0
but yesterday , after 32 years as a loyal sweetheart of the @entity7 , @entity5 sailed slowly into an uncertain future			1
the long - outdated warship came home to @entity11 for the last time – an aircraft carrier with no aircraft ; a ship without a mission			1
what they could n’t take away from one of @entity20 ’s most celebrated warships , however , was her proud history			1
so there to greet her were bikini - clad sunbathers who took to the water , former sailors who had spent much on their lives on board , families who had cheered when she was hurriedly brought into service in the @entity27 three decades ago , and spectators who had come simply to witness the end of an era			0
and the question on the lips of those who applauded , waved @entity83 flags or wept yesterday was universal			0
what now for dear old @entity1 ? the @entity85 must decide whether to preserve her for the nation she served or send her to her doom in the wake of her sister ships			2
both endured the humiliation of being towed to a scrap yard in @entity95 to be converted into tin cans and razor blades			0
it ’s a fair guess that nobody who turned out yesterday to pay their respects – not even those bronzed bathers cooling down in the shallows off @entity11 ’s ‘ hot rocks ’ shingle beach as @entity5 passed by – would wish her such an undignified end			0
elsewhere glowing tributes were paid to a warship that had sailed the equivalent of 36 times around the equator , not counting the final few hundred yards under tow into @entity11 yesterday			0
a formal decommissioning ceremony is due to be held later this year , and vice admiral sir @entity115 , the @entity7 ’s fleet commander , promised that her departure would be marked ‘ with all the pride she deserves ’			1
ideas are now being invited on how best to preserve her legacy			0
one plan is to turn her into a @entity20 - based floating museum , a proposal for which private bids are being canvassed			1
music : the band of @entity130 perform next to @entity5 as she sails into her home port of @entity11 for the final time history : during the 1990s @entity5 helped maintain the no - fly zone over @entity50 and in 1998 operated in the @entity136 bang : @entity5 fires a salute as she passes sunbathers on @entity141 beach before arriving in @entity11 for the last time in the air : two @entity143 perform a fly by as @entity5 sails into her home port of @entity11 for the final time ahead of being retired next month last journey : a @entity7 handout photograph of @entity5 sailing into its home port for the final time ahead of it being retired without enough money from investors , charities or trusts , however , there are fears she could eventually embark on the solemn , 3,500 - mile trip to that @entity95 graveyard			1
‘ it ’s emotional but the old girl has done a good job and it ’s time for her to retire , ’ said @entity161 , reunited yesterday with her petty officer husband @entity162 and rating son @entity163 as they returned from service on @entity5			2
‘ i just hope she ’s retained with dignity in the future and not left on the scrapheap			0
’ also there yesterday was warrant officer @entity174 , 51 , of @entity175 , @entity40 , who spent nearly half his 34 - year @entity7 career on @entity5			2
he even delayed his retirement to witness what he called ‘ this sad day ’			0
@entity5 is to be replaced in the short term by the ‘ younger and more capable ’ @entity180 – which recently underwent a £ 65million refit – before the new queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers come into service in 2020			1
incoming : the @entity85 has invited tenders from private firms , charities and trusts to put forward ideas on how to save the ship from being turned into scrap giant : @entity5 , pictured at @entity43 , is 685ft long and weighs 22,000 tonnes sailing in : work to complete the 22,000 - tonne ship was sped up during 1982 after the outbreak of the @entity48 up above : crew members line the deck of @entity5 as she sails into her home port of @entity11 for the final time what next ? the @entity85 has been inviting ideas on how @entity5 can be preserved , rather than sent for scrap helicopter carrier : @entity5 ( file picture ) served in the @entity50 and @entity51 conflicts and helped evacuate @entity20 during the @entity52 war in 2006 on the other side of the world : @entity5 at @entity207 in @entity208 , in 1986			1

' @entity1 ' has returned home after 32 years of service with decommissioning ceremony to be held later this year
will be replaced by @entity180 which has received £ 65m refit until next *generation* of aircraft carriers are built
@entity5 was rushed into service for the @entity48 , and has served in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52
vice admiral sir @entity115 *praises* her ' long and proud history ' and says she has ' *protected* nation 's *interests* '
685ft - long vessel @entity5 could be turned into floating museum in tribute to decommissioned class of warship
