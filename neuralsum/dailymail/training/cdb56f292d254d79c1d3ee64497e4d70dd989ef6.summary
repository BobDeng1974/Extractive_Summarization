' could it be true ? or was this some sort of telemarketing scheme ? ' @entity8 wrote in @entity43			1
' i called the number			2
a friendly man assured me that this was completely legit			0
' lured by the promise of $ 7 an hour , rising to $ 15 for ' psychics ' who racked up the most calls , @entity8 decided to give it a go , but there was just one problem			1
' the thing is , i ’m not sure that i ’m psychic , ' she admitted at a training session , but was reassured that all she would need was a professional name and a pack of tarot cards			0
the main purpose was to keep clients , who paid $ 5 a minute , on the phone for as long as possible			1
after reinventing herself as @entity66 - the name of the hospice nurse who had cared for @entity8 's father after his liver transplant - the aspiring actress was ready for her first call			1
psychic phone line : @entity8 was employed to do tarot readings for callers change of fortune : @entity8 had moved to @entity3 to pursue her dreams of a career in theater ' about half of the callers were on to me immediately			1
they would tell me that they thought this was nonsense and that i was a fraud			0
the first surly customer i encountered pummeled me , ' @entity8 wrote in @entity43			1
as the male caller 's voice became more angry , @entity8 did her best to keep to the script and keep him on the line			1
' i ’m shuffling my tarot cards			0
now ask me a question , and we ’ll see if they can give you some of the answers you ’re looking for ? , ' she told him			0

auerbach soon found a way to relate to clients , reassuring them that love - or that big career break - was just around the corner			0
while playing the part of @entity66 was difficult for @entity8 , one of her actor friends who worked for a different company , was relishing in his role			1
' he thoroughly enjoyed perpetrating a fraud , ' she said			0
' he started each call by saying that he just drank a vial of lamb 's blood to give him fortune - telling superpowers			2
' and although he admitted many people did n't believe him , it made for a light - hearted conversation that kept clients on the phone			2
rather than making clients laugh , @entity8 's psychic hotline became a place where the lonely would talk about their problems sometimes for an entire hour			1
one example was a woman named @entity137 who called in the middle of the night			0
by the end of the call auerbach knew all about her dead husband and ungrateful children			0
comfort : @entity8 , pictured with her two dogs , found herself providing a sympathetic ear to lonely clients ' i predicted that she would travel and meet a new soul mate			1
@entity137 laughed a lot , cried a little and paid $ 300 for the privilege of speaking to me , ' @entity8 admitted			1
' those folks really did n’t give a damn about psychics or readings			0
they just wanted to talk to a friendly voice , ' she added			0
' some people had terrible problems and cried a lot			0
' @entity8 did her best to keep calls from those in serious despair short , giving clients toll free helplines to contact instead			1
as well as the lonely , and the angry skeptics who would call up just to shout at her , @entity8 encountered several men under the impression that all premium rate phone lines served the same purpose			1
while these dodgy callers panted down the phone , asking if she knew what they were doing , @entity8 would continue with the tarot reading until meeting her ten - minute target			1
after that , she would end the reading and say ' oh yeah , i know what you 're doing			0
' and , when they asked what she thought about it , she would reply : ' @entity182			0
you ’re the one who ’s getting screwed			0
' her future as a telephone tarot reader was cut short thanks to a mysterious stranger from @entity189 who had called for advice and unwittingly gave @entity8 the help she needed to see a new future for herself			2
the 18 - year - old had wanted to know whether he should enlist in the military to help pay for college			0
as he talked about his parents ' death and longing to find a place where he would fit in , @entity8 found herself relating to his plight			2
chance encounter : a phone call from a young man desperate to fit in made @entity8 realize she could n't continue as a telephone psychic ' my stomach hurt			1
i identified with his uncertainty , his searching for a place to fit in , and his desire to escape , but i had a safety net			0
he did n’t , ' @entity8 said			2
' that ’s when it occurred to me that i had no business trying to guide anybody ’s major life decisions			0
i had enough trouble with my own			0
' when he asked what the cards were saying to do , @entity8 told him she could n't help and suggested he went to family and friends for advice			2
the encounter made her end the young man 's call and vow to never work as a phone psychic again .			2
