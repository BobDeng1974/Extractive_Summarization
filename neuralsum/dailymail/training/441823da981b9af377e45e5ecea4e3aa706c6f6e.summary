it proved the perfect send - off for @entity0 stalwart @entity41 , who came on a replacement for his final appearance before moving back to @entity44			2
exiles wing @entity45 gave away a kickable penalty early on and after @entity38 decided to go for touch , @entity17 burrowed over to score a try			0
@entity38 , who in total notched 23 points from the tee , converted and then bagged a penalty , before the @entity55 fly - half got himself involved in a flowing move with @entity57			0

@entity55 fly half @entity38 made 10 out of 11 kicks in a resounding win @entity36 of @entity0 was another among the try scorers at @entity16 on saturday @entity20 made it a hat - trick of tries for the @entity0 pack when he piled through the @entity5 defence beneath the posts , with @entity38 nailing the conversion once more			1
then a mighty leap from @entity20 gave @entity0 possession from a line - out , and @entity17 scurried over for his second converted try to snatch the bonus point by the half - hour mark			2
try number five came after a blistering run by @entity21 down the right , with @entity38 doing well to make the conversion			0
the @entity28 did however get off the mark when @entity84 slipped a pass through to @entity86 and @entity87 added the extras			0

and @entity16 was in seventh heaven as replacement @entity36 bagged a converted try on the hour mark			0
a wonderful jinking run by fellow substitute @entity23 saw him dance through the @entity5 defence to touch down , and moments later @entity37 used his speed to race away for the home side 's ninth try of the day			1
@entity23 bagged two more tries in quick - fire fashion , the first of which came from a lovely shimmy and pass from @entity38 , as @entity5 's miserable day came to an end .			1
