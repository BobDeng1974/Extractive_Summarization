a team of four motorcyclists have begun escorting mr @entity5 ’s prime ministerial car following a review of his protection			1

as his @entity34 left the @entity35 shortly before he was due to host a lunch a short distance away at @entity38 , a team of four motorbike outriders joined his convoy			2
@entity40 used outriders for most car journeys on security grounds , but when mr @entity5 was elected in 2010 he decided to do without them			1
a no 10 source at the time said : ‘ the prime minister feels this is probably an unnecessary extravagance			2
he is happy to put up with the same type of driving conditions as everyone else			0
' the source added : ‘ mr @entity5 feels that the police have better things to do than hold back traffic to let him get through more quickly			1
‘ it was an expense , or perhaps an ostentation , that he did not feel he needed			0
’ the decision saved the @entity59 tens of thousands of pounds a year but it caused consternation from security experts who said the outriders are needed to keep the @entity25 ’s car moving so it does not become a sitting target and can escape quickly if there is an attack			1

‘ keeping a principal moving at all times is key to protection , especially with the phenomenon of suicide bombers			0
‘ i would hope that following @entity8 there has been a swift review of the prime minister ’s security			2
’ protection measures are under review after a jogger evaded mr @entity5 ’s armed bodyguards and bumped into him on monday as he left an event			1
the 28 - year - old was arrested but released saying it was ' nothing sinister , just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time ' response : runner @entity104 said he brushed the pm before being assaulted by police @entity107 , 28 , almost knocked the prime minister off his feet before being taken away by police officers			2
