in the closing stages of the @entity2 ’ greatest day , @entity0 played like a true champion			1
but that status eluded him once again — and he knew exactly why			0
@entity6 ’s scrum - half had tormented @entity7 during the gloriously , bewilderingly compelling match which provided a pulsating finale to @entity10			1
but a fourth successive year as runners - up left the national team shattered , with their gallant role in epic sporting drama serving as meagre consolation			1
@entity6 fell just six points short of being crowned @entity2 champions a 55 - 35 victory over @entity7 was not enough for @entity6 to overhaul @entity20 at the top of the standings and though @entity0 had been the catalyst for a daring charge towards the unlikely target of a 26 - point winning margin with his two tries , countless line - breaks and dashing creativity , collective disappointment eclipsed any personal pride			1
as participants and observers alike tried to make sense of a 90 - point , 12 - try edition of ‘ @entity36 ’ which often defied logic , the devastated man of the match pinpointed why there were no medals around @entity43 necks			1
‘ i do n’t think the @entity2 title was lost today , it was lost last week , when we missed too many chances , ’ he said , in reference to the 25 - 13 victory over @entity47 seven days earlier			1
‘ we should have been way ahead on points difference going into this game			0
’ @entity0 believes @entity6 lost the @entity2 title last week when they only beat @entity47 25 - 13 @entity6 had many chances to beat @entity47 by a bigger margin last weekend at @entity56 correct			1
it would have deprived a captivated audience of an absorbing spectacle spanning three high - octane games , but @entity6 could have made saturday ’s fixtures in @entity62 and @entity63 all but irrelevant if they had n’t squandered a raft of try - scoring openings in round four			2
if @entity68 ’s men had merely needed to win , they would not have scorched the earth as they did time and again in front of a fervent crowd , but it is highly likely they would have secured their prize			2
instead , they ran amok to amass a record total against their @entity76 rivals , only to be left six points short and inches from glory as a rolling maul at the end threatened to bring the house down until referee @entity84 penalised the hosts to signal the dying of the light			0
after familiar @entity43 dejection and an outpouring of @entity92 euphoria as @entity94 ’s team retained their title on points difference , the inquests began at @entity56			2
@entity98 's inspired performance helped @entity99 to a 61 - 20 win over @entity101 to put them in with a shout @entity20 thrashed @entity47 40 - 10 at @entity103 to overhaul @entity99 , and @entity6 fell short in their response circumstances demanded an adventurous streak and the upshot was seven tries against opponents who had conceded just two in their previous four games			1
a torrent of quick lineouts and tapped penalties , heads - up running and off - loading made for a stirring sight but , while the real damage had been done a week before , there were also fresh faults			2
for all his evident pride , backs coach @entity121 will not have been amused to see @entity6 concede five tries at home , even though they had to go for broke			2
when @entity124 rounded off a stunning @entity126 raid on the hour , @entity0 wore a thunderous look			2
‘ they took their tries well but we ’ve got to be better than that , ’ he said			0
‘ it was one step forward , one step back			0
for every good thing we did , we were n’t able to keep backing it up			0
if we can be a bit smarter in defence , that is the way for us to play			0
’ @entity6 ’s expansive approach was certainly effective and pleasing to the eye , but there was a period in the first half when they became too frantic , when a composed outlook would have told them to build a score patiently			2
@entity68 has seen his side finish as runners - up in the @entity2 for four years in a row still , criticism must be tempered in the context of a 20 - point thumping of a @entity126 team which bore no resemblance to the rabble of previous weekends			1
for @entity0 , there was irritation that their opponents had fought hard while @entity47 and @entity101 had presented limited resistance to the other title challengers			1
‘ @entity7 turned up — i do n’t know what happened to @entity101 or @entity47 , ’ he said			1
‘ we knew we were going to be chasing it and we did that			0
but it was shame those other teams were n’t a bit more resilient			0
’ @entity7 ’s resilience brought out the best in several @entity6 players besides @entity0			1
captain @entity170 strove to carry the ball and the team heroically while @entity173 was in the sin bin for a rash trip in the second half			0
@entity177 completed another 80 minutes of surging intensity and out wide , @entity179 had been peripheral early on but by the end he was rampant and had another two tries			0
@entity6 started their campaign with a morale - boosting win over @entity185 rivals @entity99 @entity43 thoughts of ‘ if only ’ have become an annual routine and this year they have cause to lament the failure to cope with an aerial barrage in @entity192 and their profligacy against @entity47			1
the second - half efforts against @entity99 and @entity7 represented their peaks and as @entity197 noted , with the @entity185 in mind they will take heart from recent wins over @entity202 rivals @entity99 and @entity203			1
@entity56 was loud and proud on saturday evening and with five consecutive victories there , @entity205 ’s side are enjoying a spell of home rule at just the right time			0
the performances of @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity179 have generated optimism , and while inside centre remains a problem position , in most areas there are now multiple options			0
the likes of @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 face a battle to reclaim lost places			0
as they stood in their post-match huddle , @entity6 were no doubt exhausted and demoralised			2
finishing second again suggests they are stuck on a plateau but , in certain respects , this performance represented telling and timely progress .			0

@entity6 missed out on winning the @entity2 title by six points
a 20 - point victory over @entity7 was not enough to clinch championship
@entity68 's side finished runners - up for the fourth straight year
@entity0 says championship was lost against @entity47 last week
@entity6 's performance provides plenty of optimism for @entity185
