are @entity0 right to sack @entity1 ? as @entity1 ’s reign unravelled on monday , tales emerged of senior @entity0 players beating a path to the door of sir @entity9 ’s @entity8 home to urge their old manager to push for change			1
the message was clear : they no longer stood by @entity1 and neither should @entity0 if the empire @entity9 built was not going to continue crumbling , brick by brick			1
there was no more staunch a supporter of @entity1 than his fellow @entity19			2
after all , it was @entity9 who had called the @entity22 manager away from a shopping trip with his wife , @entity24 , to that same address in @entity26 to offer him the job last may when the ill - fated legend of ‘ @entity29 ’ was born			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 @entity19 to trot : @entity1 tenure as @entity0 manager was ended after players complained to @entity9 time 's up ! sir @entity9 played a major part in electing @entity1 as his successor @entity37 : @entity0 are desperate to return to winning ways after their worst season in @entity41 history ‘ to be honest , it was done when @entity9 said but it was good for me to meet @entity1 and hear his ideas and plans , ’ claimed @entity0 chief @entity42 in an interview last october , in what could now be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the appointment as the storm clouds gathered			1
‘ without the recommendation of @entity9 there may have been a different process			2
’ @entity1 reminded us of that episode last friday , at what proved to be his final pre-match press conference , as he revisited the story of his departure from @entity22			2
it was never going to be an easy transition			0
when @entity9 stood on the @entity64 turf as @entity0 boss for the last time on that may day and urged supporters to back the new manager through good times and bad — even before his successor had been confirmed — he could see trouble ahead			1
it is a sign of just how much @entity9 is revered that the fans obeyed him through the most wretched of seasons , even when the banner dedicated to @entity1 in the @entity75 became a focal point of contention and then embarrassment and rebel planes started circling overhead			1
great expectations : @entity9 addressed @entity64 on his final game urging them to get behind the new man back in the day : @entity0 players want to see a return to the glory days they enjoyed under @entity9 @entity9 , may 2013 ‘ we ’ve had bad times here			1
the club stood by me			0
all my staff stood by me			0
the players stood by me			0
so your job now is to stand by our new manager			0
’ @entity99 , may 2013 ‘ we have secured a man who is committed to the long term and will build teams for the future as well as now			0
’ @entity9 , oct 2013 ‘ @entity1 was at @entity22 for 10 years			1
there ’s evidence that sticking with a manager does help			0
’ @entity42 , oct 2013 ‘ we do n’t want the manager to be a hired gun for the next two or three years			0
we want the next generation to enjoy having him there creating his own legacy			0
’ @entity110 , feb 2014 ‘ i think @entity1 is a great manager , but it takes time			2
there ’s a transitional period			0
’ @entity118 , march 2014 ‘ i think @entity1 will get plenty of time			2
’ they never forgot how @entity9 survived and then thrived in the early @entity119 and hoped @entity1 would somehow follow a similar road to redemption			1
without their patience and understanding , he would have been toast some time ago			0
but when @entity9 himself became the target for their anger in recent weeks , when @entity1 openly questioned the squad that he had inherited , and @entity9 ’s final act as manager was suddenly threatening to taint all that had gone before , enough was enough			1
as if an increasingly bleak future under @entity1 was n’t bad enough , the whole mess was in danger of casting a cloud over their glorious past			2
the comparisons with sir @entity140 and @entity141 44 years ago have become quite uncanny			0
@entity1 is a good man , a proud man , and someone who has n’t turned into a bad coach overnight			2
but @entity9 cast a long shadow and it was one he never came close to escaping			2
as much as @entity1 benefited from his predecessor ’s support , there is no doubt @entity9 ’s achievements became a weight around his neck , his presence a distraction			1
selection policy : @entity1 was coined ' @entity29 ' after his appointment headed by @entity9 @entity157 : fans vented their frustration with a fly - by protest proclaiming @entity1 the ' wrong one ' @entity1 insisted @entity9 was an occasional presence , always helpful but never intrusive ; that his aura around the club was not a problem			1
he may think differently in hindsight			0
at least @entity141 did n’t have to sit through every match at @entity64 facing a stand bearing the name of the legend he had replaced , while modern television has enabled cameras to zoom in on @entity9 ’s expression every time @entity1 suffered a setback — and there were far too many of those for comfort every time another black mark appeared on his record , it was compared unfavourably with the man he replaced			1
is it over yet ? @entity9 's visits to @entity64 became less comfortable , with some fans even turning on him a post-mortem into @entity0 ’s failings this season was never complete without mention of how @entity1 had done away with @entity9 ’s entire backroom team last summer			1
@entity190 joined the coaching staff , a nod to the @entity9 dynasty , but his opinion was rarely sought and barely valued			2
troubled times : @entity0 's 2 - 0 loss to @entity22 at the weekend was their 11th defeat of the season bad to worse : @entity1 has failed to live up to expectations at @entity64 and has paid the price @entity190 became an increasingly despondent figure and when two of @entity9 ’s ‘ @entity203 ’ , @entity202 and @entity204 , criticised @entity1 ’s team and signings on television last month it was a sign the old guard were in rebellion			1
stalwarts of the @entity9 era , such as @entity213 and @entity214 , had long since lost faith in @entity1			1
@entity216 made it clear from the outset he was unhappy with the change			0
@entity220 , one of the bright young things @entity9 left behind , now wants out			0
others simply lost direction and heart			0
singing from a different sheet ? @entity190 joined the coaching staff but was rarely asked for input sir @entity9 was aware of the unrest			1
his players made sure of that when they took the issue to his front door			0
having been so instrumental in @entity1 ’s appointment , it is unclear what part @entity9 played in the decision to call time or how hard he fought to save him when the @entity240 family and @entity42 lost patience			1
ultimately , though , it was his legacy that stood to suffer from this whole sorry affair .			0
