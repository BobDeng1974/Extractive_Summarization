the ' lost city of @entity1 has eluded explorers for centuries and is almost certainly the stuff of myth			0
staggeringly , though , an ancient city that is @entity1 in all but name has emerged from under the sea near @entity9 — and now the lost world of @entity11 is giving up its treasures			1
just as in the classical tale , @entity11 was once a prosperous , thriving city before it was engulfed by the sea around 1,500 years ago			1
it was grand enough to be mentioned by the @entity18 writer @entity17 , the 5th - century @entity19 historian			0
he told the fabulous story of @entity22 , the most beautiful woman in the world — she of the face that launched a thousand ships — travelling to @entity11 , then a port of ‘ great wealth ’ , with her glamorous @entity29 lover , @entity30			1
@entity39 marine archaeologist @entity38 ( right ) explains text on the stele of @entity11 @entity38 and divers from his team inspect the statue of a pharaoh among the most important monuments that were discovered at the temple area of @entity48 is this monolithic chapel dating to the @entity51 period but no physical evidence of such a grand settlement appeared until 2001 , when a group led by @entity39 marine archaeologist @entity38 stumbled upon some relics that led them to one of the greatest finds of the 21st century			1
@entity59 was in search of @entity62 ’s warships from the @entity63 , when he was defeated by @entity64 in these very waters , but came upon this much more significant discovery			0
@entity59 ’s team has since been joined by the @entity68 and the @entity69 to produce a wealth of dazzling finds			0
the archaeologists first faced the mammoth task of reassembling massive stone fragments on the seabed before they could haul them to the surface			2
twelve years on , their fabulous finds have been exposed to public view for the first time after more than a millennium spent beneath the silt and water of @entity83 , 20 miles north - east of @entity9			2
among the discoveries are colossal statues of the @entity87 goddess @entity88 , the god @entity89 , and an unidentified @entity87 pharaoh — all preserved in immaculate condition by their muddy burial shroud			0
along with these 16ft statues there are hundreds of smaller statues of @entity87 gods — among them the figures that guarded the temple where @entity100 was inaugurated as @entity101			0
it seems the @entity99 at @entity11 was the @entity87 equivalent of @entity104 , where our own @entity101 was crowned 60 years ago			1
dozens of sarcophagi have been found , containing the bodies of mummified animals sacrificed to @entity110 , the supreme god of the @entity87			0
many amulets , or religious charms , have been unearthed , too , showing gods such as @entity88 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
these were made not just for the @entity87 but for visiting traders , who incorporated them into their own religions and also , one imagines , kept them as trinkets to remind them of their far - flung journeys			0
the importance of @entity11 has been further proved by the discovery of 64 ships — the largest number of ancient vessels ever found in one place — and a mind - boggling 700 anchors			1
other finds illustrate how crucial @entity11 was to the economy of the ancient world			1
gold coins and lead , bronze and stone weights from @entity137 ( used to measure the value of goods and to calculate the tax owed ) show that @entity11 was a lucrative @entity142 trading post			1
an archaeologist measures the feet of a colossal red granite statue at the site of @entity11 discovered in @entity83 the statue of the @entity88 sits on display on a barge in an @entity9 naval base ( left )			1
pictured right is a colossal statue of red granite representing the @entity154 , which decorated the temple of @entity11 an international team of marine archaeologists is preparing to show some of the objects found in the underwater city @entity11 was mentioned by the @entity18 historian @entity17 , who told of @entity22 visiting the city with her lover @entity30 before the trojan war in the ancient world , the @entity142 was their equivalent of a superfast motorway			1
all their greatest cities , including @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity137 , were either on the coast or on rivers with easy access to it			0
and now @entity11 can be added to their number as @entity87 ’s most important port during the time of the later pharaohs			1
it was , if you like , a major motorway junction — the spot where the @entity184 , @entity87 ’s lifeline , met the @entity186 have determined that as well as having a naturally navigable channel next to its ancient harbour , a further artificial channel appears to have been dug to expedite trade			0
the @entity11 finds will add tremendous depth to our understanding of the ancient world — not least because , among the discoveries , there are perfectly preserved steles ( inscribed pillars ) decorated with hieroglyphics			1
translated , they will reveal much about the religious and political life in this corner of ancient @entity87			0
it was a similar inscription on the @entity204 — discovered in the @entity206 town of @entity204 in 1799 by a @entity39 soldier , and now in the @entity209 — that cracked the code of hieroglyphics in the first place			2
and like the @entity204 , those steles found beneath the waters of @entity83 are inscribed in @entity18 and @entity87 , too			0
who knows how many more archaeological gems will be uncovered at @entity11 ? the very name of the city is taken from that most famous of @entity18 heroes , @entity221 — aka @entity222 — whose 12 labours , from killing the @entity224 to capturing @entity225 , the multi-headed hellhound that guarded the gates of the @entity228 , captivated the ancient world			1
@entity230 , @entity231 ’s capital and largest city , is also named after @entity221 , as was @entity233 , the ancient @entity235 town that was buried under ash when @entity237 erupted in 79 ad			0
it appears that @entity11 faded in importance in the later classical period , eclipsed by its neighbouring city of @entity9 , which became the capital of @entity87 in @entity244			2
still , @entity11 lingered on , later under @entity235 control , until it slipped into its watery grave some time in the 6th or 7th century @entity19			2
what a thrilling discovery we have on our hands now that the sea has , 1,500 years later , given up one of its greatest secrets			2
the ancient port city lies 20 miles northeast of @entity9 in the @entity142 items including 16ft sculptures , gold coins and giant tablets are among some of the objects recovered from the ancient port city one theory suggests a rise in sea level and unstable collapsing sediment combined to submerge the city			2

@entity11 was submerged by the sea and sands 1,200 years ago
was discovered during a survey at the beginning of the last decade
archaeologists are now preparing to show some of the objects found
