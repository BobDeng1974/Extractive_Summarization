by @entity0 for the @entity1 teenagers were warned to expect a shock when they get their a-level results today after a crackdown on resits			0
this year they had to take the exams in one sitting instead of being able to sit them a second time to boost grades			1
this could leave many faring worse than expected , said experts			1
previously pupils were able to try papers in january and then again in june			1
analysts have predicted the changes will lead to a dip in the number of top grades			2
any fall in a * and a grades would be the third consecutive drop after more than 20 years of relentless rises			1
education expert professor @entity38 warned : ‘ with the removal of the january exams , candidates this year are going to be examined on the whole year			1
‘ taking the exam at the end of the course is probably going to be more difficult because you have got the whole year ’s work to understand			2
' you can not take the exam in january and if you ’ve dipped have another go at it , so that they may tend to push the results down a bit			0
‘ the change from 2013 to 2014 means that it will be a bit of a shock to some students who got their eye in on the old arrangements and now suddenly find they have to cope with a whole year ’s work			1
’ the comments of the professor , director of the @entity60 at @entity61 , follow a previous alert by @entity63			0
the exams watchdog has warned that results at both a-level and @entity67 will be ‘ particularly volatile ’ in 2014			0
this year is also expected to feature the biggest university clearing round in history			1
the squeeze on top grades comes in a year when there has also been a fall in the number of 18 - year - olds and an extra 30,000 university places made available			1
even elite institutions are set to enter the annual scramble to fill spare places , hoping to pick off the best applicants			0
the combination of factors could benefit students who slip grades as they could get into sought - after universities after all			1
while any dip in good grades is expected to be slight , the impact on individual schools and pupils could be more dramatic			1
schools which relied heavily on resits to boost final grades and failed to adapt quickly are expected to be the worst hit			1
those which made less use of the resit window are likely to see little change			0
@entity63 has pledged to ensure that national results are ‘ held steady ’ to avoid disadvantaging candidates in the first year of the new system			2
but it expects a ‘ greater variation ’ between schools			0
nationally , pupils are expected to pass around 26 per cent of a-levels at grades a or a *			1
but schools which made heavy use of resits could see the proportion of pupils getting good grades plummet			2
professor @entity38 added : ‘ they are going to try and hold the national result pretty much the same , probably a bit down , but the make - up of the schools contributing to that overall pattern will be different			0
’ independent schools are expected to be least affected by the change as they are believed to have entered more pupils for end - of - course exams			1
the worst - hit are expected to be those which encouraged students to resit as - levels – the first half of an a-level course			1
‘ the @entity131 have been important for university admissions and a lot of effort would have gone into getting those as good as possible , ’ said professor @entity38			0
‘ there was quite a lot of opportunity in the past			0
’ @entity140 , chief executive of @entity63 , has warned that schools will be affected differently depending on how they structured courses			0
those where pupils already sat exams at the end of their courses were less likely to be hit			2
@entity150 , a senior official at the @entity151 , said : ‘ we wait to see what the impact of the removal of january exams has had on students who could not take one unit early this year			1
‘ this change will have put students under a lot more pressure as january exams gave them the chance to complete part of their course and track their progress			2
‘ we hope that students have not been disadvantaged because of this move to an end - of - year exam			2
it has been introduced with no trialling and has put increased pressure on a system that is already creaking			0
’ the number of a-levels awarded a * or @entity173 tripled between the early 1980s and 2010 , hitting a record high of 27 per cent in that year and in 2011			0
but top grades dropped marginally to 26.6 per cent in 2012 following the introduction of measures aimed at controlling grade inflation before dipping last summer to 26.3 per cent			2
research by the @entity1 has found that most universities in the elite 24 - strong @entity181 are preparing to enter clearing this year while many other institutions also expect to have more places available			0
@entity181 universities will mainly be battling it out for students with @entity188 grades after the government allowed unrestrained competition for applicants with these marks			1
some parents are offering their children incentives of up to £ 2,000 for achieving an a * and £ 1,500 for an a grade , according to a study by @entity199			0
boys have been offered £ 183 on average for doing well against £ 124 for girls			0
some 11 per cent of youngsters have been offered a laptop , 11 per cent a car and 10 per cent a holiday .			0

experts warn some pupils will have done worse than expected in exams
drop in grades comes after @entity26 initiative to drop resit papers
previous system allowed pupils to sit exams in winter and in summer
this year students were forced to take all papers in one sitting
