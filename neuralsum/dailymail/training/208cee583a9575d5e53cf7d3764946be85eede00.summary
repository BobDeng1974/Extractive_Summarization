while some passengers may think that flight attendants get the better end of the bargain when it comes to places to take a snooze mid-flight , it seems that may not be the case at all			0
in a new post penned by airline crew member @entity12 - for travel information website @entity13 - she debunked some myths and revealed what it 's really like behind the scenes when the cabin lights are dimmed			1
speaking about an image from airline company @entity22 , ms @entity12 says this representation of the crew looking relaxed as they chat over a cup of coffee is unfortunately for her and many others , a misconception			2
@entity43 ! ... if i ever actually find time to do that on a flight , i ’ll come back and let you know ! ' she wrote			0
ms @entity12 , who has worked for a major @entity51 carrier for the past 15 years , goes on to say the ' cute ' and ' vintage ' scene portrayed never actually takes place , and the reality is much less glamorous			2
' what really happens in crew bunks is more like a sprint to see how fast you can throw your body into a horizontal position and slam those eyes shut ( and pray for actual sleep , especially if it ’s only 6 p.m. )			0
' if a crew member is lucky ( or unlucky ) enough to nab the first break , they then need to make the tough decision to either sacrifice precious shut - eye to shovel some food into their mouth or try and sleep through hunger pains			1
ms @entity12 , a veteran flight attendant , said the rest areas are n't always spacious and comfortable as people think they are ' and even if they did feel like catching up over a cuppa in the crew rest area , which is often substantially smaller than the public perceive them to be - it would more than likely be poorly received by colleagues			1
' ms @entity12 also revealed the perils of having to share the rest room with other attendants who are a little more than inconsiderate			1
' a certain flight attendant is on my mental hit list for how clumsily he comes into the bunkroom			0
he ’s always 20 minutes late , bangs the door shut and carelessly tosses his shoes to the floor ' , she wrote			0
often the sleeping spaces are tucked away , and sometimes staff have no other option but to take a snooze sitting up behind a curtain also addressed was the variation in size of rest areas on aircraft , depending on the size of the plane , the airline company and the length of the flight			1
some planes do n't even provide beds for the crew , but simply a single seat in a curtained off area of the plane , often just by where the passengers line up to use the bathroom			0
' i 've spent many a crew '' rest '' with a parade of bums pressed against my shoulder as passengers wait in line for the restroom on the other side of the curtain			0
inconsiderate crew members can also be a hassle when attendants are trying to get some shut eye ' sometimes i even open my eyes at the sound of snaps being undone , only to see the head of a @entity133 passenger poking in to stare at us sleep , ' ms @entity12 wrote			1
she closed the piece with a reiterations that flight attendants certainly do n't live a life of luxury lounging around in fancy bunks			2
' when we do , it may not have the @entity145 ambiance , but one thing is consistent : we ’re intensely grateful for whatever we do get ! like you , i just hope for flights where i can get a horizontal space , even if just for a bit ' , ms @entity12 revealed .			2
