@entity0 watched @entity1 bounce back to winning ways before warning his players they must show further improvement in the push for promotion			1
the @entity8 side recovered from their defeat against @entity10 as two goals from @entity12 and one each from @entity14 and @entity15 swamped @entity16 in a 4 - 0 victory			1
@entity0 , though , was n’t happy with some of lax moments within their performance and insisted that better will be needed for wednesday night ’s trip to face a @entity22 side fighting for survival			1
@entity12 celebrates after putting his side 3 - 0 up as @entity1 cruised to victory over @entity16 that meeting with the @entity28 ’s bottom club is @entity1 ’ game in hand over @entity31 , providing the chance to push three points clear in the battle for second place			1
‘ it was okay , ’ reflected @entity0 on the victory over @entity16 , who are locked in mid-table safety			1
‘ there were some nice goals , although we were sloppy at times			0
‘ for a little period in the second - half of 20 minutes , we went through the motions and we ca n’t afford to do that			2
‘ it was pleasing in a few senses with some nice goals , some decent football and a clean sheet			0
‘ but we certainly know that wednesday night will be a different challenge			0
i was at the @entity54 versus @entity56 game on saturday and you could sense that @entity54 had everything to play for and @entity56 nothing bar pride , obviously			0
‘ i thought the game today might pan out as it did , but wednesday will be different with @entity22 flying in terms of their recent results			1
‘ there is no singing and dancing today			1
i still think that we ’ll need to be better and we can be better , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity0 has warned @entity1 to be on their guard against @entity22 in midweek the pick of the @entity1 goals again came from @entity15 , who has scored in each of his last five @entity8 appearances			1
the @entity72 loanee has netted seven times in 12 @entity1 outings overall			1
‘ we tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting @entity15 into more space , ’ added @entity0 , who expects another of the loanees , @entity79 , to begin training with @entity1 today			1
‘ but he still tends to head for the right - hand side , which is his favourite			2
‘ every time he cuts in onto his left , you expect the net to bulge			0
‘ we had good footballers in there with him , @entity12 , @entity91 and @entity92 , who i thought was terrific again			0
‘ i said from day one that @entity15 has got fantastic ability			0
‘ obviously , he has got fitter having played more games now , and his match fitness is now looking strong at the end of games where he was flagging after 50 or 60 minutes earlier			0
‘ that ’s just having more time on the park			0
he is important to us and he is a goal threat			0
’ @entity14 ( left ) heads it home to give @entity1 an early lead @entity16 manager @entity105 feels @entity1 have improved under @entity0 , but he also believes that whichever @entity28 side comes through the play - offs will face a difficult task to clear the final promotion hurdle			1
‘ they still have to go and play a @entity111 team and there is a good chance that that team will have a winning mentality , ’ said @entity105			0
‘ people are talking about @entity118 or @entity119 - well it wo n’t be an easy task going to these kind of places			2
‘ i think everyone is talking about how @entity1 have picked up now and they look like a strong team who will finish second			2
‘ @entity31 have had a fantastic season , too , in terms of the attacking football they play , but i think @entity10 are also keeping themselves in there			2
‘ we knew @entity1 would come at us after losing on thursday and we knew it would be difficult			2
it is difficult coming to places like this and you have to stand up and have the right mentality			0
but going a goal down so early put us on the back foot			0

*rangers* beat @entity16 4 - 0 but @entity0 is *aware* of tough test @entity22 will provide in midweek
he said he was *concerned* about some lax moments in the win at @entity8
@entity1 can go three points clear of @entity31 with a win
' there is no singing and dancing today . we have done ok . i still think that we ’ll need to be better and we can be better , ' @entity0 said
