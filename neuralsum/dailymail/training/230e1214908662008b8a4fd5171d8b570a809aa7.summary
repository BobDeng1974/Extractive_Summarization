by @entity0 almost 25 years after being videotaped smoking crack with a woman in a hotel room , former @entity2 mayor @entity1 still insists that he was a victim of an entrenched white power structure			1
in a new memoir out this week called ' @entity8 , ' @entity1 writes about his decades in politics , the stunning fall from grace that has come to define his career , and the people he still holds responsible			1
a review from the @entity16 calls @entity1 ' the original @entity17 ' and marvels over his insistence that he was set up			1
in his new book , @entity1 claims he was the victim of powerful white men who did n't like his challenge to the status quo @entity24 was arrested after being caught on tape smoking crack cocaine in 1990 @entity1 , who claims he gave city contracts to black business owners that it eventually took up 47 per cent of the city 's $ 2 billion budget , writes that his challenge to the status quo put a target on his back			1
' @entity36 folks may let you in their country clubs to play golf , invite you out to dinner , take you out to play tennis , but when it comes to dividing up the money , that ’s a whole ’ nother story , ' he writes			2
' they did n’t want me creating all of these opportunities for black folks			2
so when the @entity49 set me up at the @entity50 , they were really trying to kill me			1
if they killed me , they would n’t have to worry about me anymore			2
' there are some who would agree			0
the surveillance video of @entity1 smoking crack in 1990 led to six months in prison for drug possession charges			1
and despite the city 's own struggles against a sweeping and destructive crack epidemic , but he was released to massive crowds who considered him a hero			2
he was elected mayor again in 1994			1
to this day he retains a seat on the @entity2 city council			1

@entity1 remembers that after she came back from a third trip to the bathroom she told him : “ that ’s some good s —			1
you want some ? this makes my p — - hot			0
” ' at first i hesitated , ' @entity1 writes			2
' i had never done anything like that before			0
but this woman ’s comment excited me			0
if cocaine made this woman feel that hot , i wondered how it would make me feel			0
' after accidentally blowing cocaine all over on a botched first attempt , @entity1 finally inhaled the powerful narcotic			2
' that was my first time ever trying cocaine , and i felt like i had ejaculated , ' he writes			0
' the cocaine was a powerful stimulant that went straight to my penis			0
what happened next ? i had sex with her			0
' @entity1 claims he gave city contracts to black businesses , angering powerful people that was the first step on the road to the @entity105 on jan. 18 , 1990 , a day he refers to as ' the war to reclaim @entity2 for white people			1
' in his telling , he was set up that day by @entity109 , a teacher and former model then in her 30s who he had fallen for			0
he claims she was addicted to cocaine while he remained a casual user hoping to quit entirely			2
the breaking point between them came when he found her smoking crack in an executive suite at the @entity119 at an @entity121 fundraiser , and proceeded to smash her pipe			1
he also found five crack rocks in her purse that he tried to flush down the toilet @entity109 wrestled them away			2
' it was like @entity128 in ‘ @entity129 , ’ ' he remembers			0
' i was n’t a violent person			0
i had never hit a woman in my life , but i had to smack @entity109 upside her head and push her down to get her off me			0
i told her , ‘ @entity109 , you gots to go now ! ’ ' @entity1 remains active in @entity2 politics and holds a seat on the city council he avoided her for months after			1
but , he claims , when his enemies discovered she had a bench warrant for failing to appear at a grand jury hearing they used the threat of jail to get her to cooperate			2
the @entity49 then ' put her up at the @entity105 , placed cameras in the room , supplied the drugs and told her what to say			1
they even babysat her kids			0
' once in @entity2 she harassed @entity1 until he finally agreed to meet with her			1
though he claims to have arrived at the @entity50 with a security detail agreeing to meet @entity109 in the lobby , he was outfoxed when the woman he last saw screaming in a drug - fueled rage told him : ' i just ordered a bowl of soup , but once i finish that , we can come back downstairs			2
' @entity1 claims a former lover was coerced to set him up by the @entity49 once he went upstairs , his resolve began to weaken			1
' i started thinking sexually while sipping my drink , ' he writes			0
' but every time i reached to caress her breasts , she pulled away from me			0

’ that was @entity109 ’s code word for drug talk			0
' the rest is history			0
