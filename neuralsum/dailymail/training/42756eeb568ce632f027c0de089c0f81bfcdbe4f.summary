the @entity7 is set to unveil public service advertisements aimed at men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains			1
a poster will read : ' dude ... stop the spread , please ' , alongside an image of two subway commuters forced to stand because a man is sitting in the typical ' manspread stance - legs splayed into a wide v - shape			1
the new adverts come as more customers are crowding onto @entity2 underground trains than at any other time in recent history			1
as many as 6.1 million riders were logged to have used the @entity40 on a single day in 2014 , up from just under 5.1 million customers on the busiest day a decade ago			1
' @entity42 ' has become a hotly debated topic for subway riders , who go so far as to post photographs of the worst culprits on @entity47 or even confront them on video			2
last week , a reporter for @entity50 set out to confront ' manspreaders ' on the @entity2 subway one commuter explains that his splay is to accommodate a bag , while another says that he is exhausted last week , a reporter for @entity50 set out to confront ' manspreaders ' on the @entity2 subway and did not have trouble finding interviewees			2
