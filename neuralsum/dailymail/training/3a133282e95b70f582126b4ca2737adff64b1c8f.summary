@entity0 faced a backlash from his own supporters last night after calling for @entity3 to admit refugees from the civil war in @entity6			1
supporters of the @entity3 @entity8 denounced their leader after mr @entity0 used an interview with the @entity11 yesterday to call for @entity3 to allow those fleeing @entity6 to come to the @entity3			1
he said refugees fleeing from conflicts were ‘ a very different thing ’ from economic migrants			1
@entity0 has become the target of fury from his own supporters after suggesting the @entity3 should accept @entity6 refugees during a debate with the @entity11 yesterday but he was attacked online by @entity8 supporters - who said the country was already ‘ full up ’ and warned they would no longer vote for @entity8 unless he changes his mind			1
mr @entity0 ’s policy goes further than the @entity26 , which has limited its help to financial support for countries taking in refugees			1
the @entity8 leader said : ‘ i think refugees are a very different thing to economic migration and i think this country should honour the 1951 declaration on refugee status that was agreed			1
‘ the original ideas of defining what a refugee is were good ones and i think , actually , there is a responsibility on all of us in the free @entity45 to try and help some of those people fleeing @entity6 , literally in fear of their lives			1
’ mr @entity0 argued that a refugee - fleeing a country fearing for their life - and a migrant who moves to earn more money are two different things mr @entity0 called for ‘ a proper debate ’ about ‘ the difference between a refugee - who fears for his or her life - or somebody moving simply for economic benefit ’			1
he did not put a figure on how many of the nine million @entity6 displaced by war who should be allowed into the @entity3 , but @entity65 has said @entity3 should accept up to 500			1
mr @entity0 ’s intervention appeared to be an attempt to show voters that @entity8 is not opposed to all immigration following months of accusations from political rivals that the party is racist			1
but the move backfired immediately as @entity8 supporters flocked to the party ’s @entity75 page to denounce the plans			2
building contractor @entity78 said : ‘ i suggest that you get @entity0 to clarify his comments so as we ukip voters retain our faith in him and his party			1
' @entity8 was our salvation , so why even consider making such ludicrous comments			0
is he losing the plot ? clarify or lose many voters			0
’ truck driver @entity89 added : ‘ stuff the @entity8			0
i was going to vote for these , not now			0
sorry , [ the ] @entity3 is full already			1
’ @entity91 accused mr @entity0 of having ‘ lost touch with reality ’ and asked : ‘ or you have been bought ? got to rethink my vote			2
’ @entity96 added : ‘ i ’ve backed @entity8 for ages but if this is how he is going to do it , i ’ll cut my ties			0
’ @entity99 wrote : ‘ beginning to think you ’re just another out of touch politician			0
recently you come across that you have n’t got a clue about what ’s going on here			0
’ @entity104 wrote : ‘ we are full up			0
we need to get our country back on a sound financial footing , we can not take on the responsibility of the world on our shoulders , think again @entity0			2
’ @entity78 wrote : ‘ @entity0 , @entity6 refugees need to be safe from the civil war in their country , but bring them here			1
i think not ! our country is overcrowded as it is and to suggest things like this is ludicrous			0
so far nine million people have been displaced in the @entity6 civil war and have fled to neighboring countries including @entity120 , where roughly 115,000 are camped ( pictured ) ‘ i am disappointed that you have suggested such a thing			1
these people would need financial aid , housing and the use of our schools and hospitals , therefore [ they would be ] a huge financial burden on our society			0
' this was the one main reason i support [ ed ] @entity8 , i am starting to have doubts now			0
’ @entity135 said : ‘ i liked what was being said in the beginning when we thought you as a party were standing up for @entity3			2
' now it seems that you are sitting down with the rest , spouting the same old rhetoric			0
’ @entity145 mp @entity144 backed mr @entity0			2
‘ clearly we ca n’t take all the refugees but we should play our part as an open - hearted , compassionate country , ’ he said			0
@entity0 's policy goes further than the government , who are so far only offering financial aid to victims former shadow minister @entity155 said : ‘ it ’s about mr @entity0 trying to reposition his party so that the anti-immigration argument , which is so important to them , is not seen as a barbaric argument , so from that point of view there is a bit of political positioning going on			1
‘ it ’s not a bad idea but it will be incredibly complicated ; it will need to involve the entire @entity169 , probably the @entity170 , probably @entity171 , maybe even @entity172 ; pretty much the entire western world will have to pick up the burden because we ’re talking possibly of millions of people			0
’ fellow conservative @entity177 branded mr @entity0 ’s comments ‘ political tokenism ’			2
‘ these are @entity6 people who want to live in @entity6			2
the solution is not taking a few hundred people to make us feel happier , ’ he said			0
‘ what we need is a politically - negotiated solution to this problem			0

@entity0 has suggested the @entity3 should accept @entity6 refugees
argued in and interview that ' refugee ' and ' economic migrant ' are different
he has faced a backlash from supporters demanding he change his view
