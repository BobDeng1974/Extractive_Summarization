on the night of the tragedy , he had been out with friends in @entity15 before making his way home to @entity47 , near @entity48 , on the last train at 11.10pm			0
his companions said they did not consider him to be drunk			0
but after he missed his stop , he waited until @entity52 , @entity19 , to get off the train			0
he was seen walking home along the @entity54 at @entity18 some three miles away			2
at around 1.30am , a couple had driven past on the other side of the road and saw mr @entity0 fall and hit his head			1
but he sat up in the road and appeared to be searching for his glasses			0
seconds later , @entity24 's large @entity63 passed them heading towards him			1
another driver flashed his headlights when he saw the vehicle approaching			0
he thought it would stop , but the driver made no attempt to slow down or steer around the object			0

@entity79 , prosecuting , said said : ' ultimately and tragically he stumbled into the road and fell and was hit by @entity24 's car			1
' mr @entity0 was walking home after a night out with friends when he collapsed onto the carriageway at @entity18 ( pictured ) in @entity19 and was run over by @entity2 moments later , @entity85 drove past @entity24 's 4x4 and after seeing a badly injured man , he quickly turned his car round and went back to the scene			1
' he saw @entity2 standing next to his car , ' said ms @entity79			2
' when mr @entity85 asked what had happened , @entity2 said he had found the body and dragged it to the side of the road			1
' @entity24 had asked mr @entity85 if he had a phone , who ‘ in his panic ’ had forgotten he had his mobile with him , she added			2
but after driving off , he called police to report what he had seen			0
and by the time another motorist passed the scene and saw the body , @entity24 was nowhere to be seen			2
he had stopped for just two - and - a - half minutes before leaving the scene			0
police pieced together evidence from witnesses and cctv footage , tracing @entity24 to his farmhouse 12 hours later			2
he told officers he had seen the body in the road and thought it was a bin bag – and added it was only when he stopped that he realised it was a man , who he said was cold so must have been dead for some time			2
@entity24 had also falsely claimed a taxi had stopped and he spoke to the driver , who said he would ring 999 , before he eventually drove off			0
ms @entity79 added : ' it 's highly improbable he engaged in conversation with any taxi driver			0
despite an appeal , no taxi driver ever came forward			0
' mr @entity0 was pronounced dead at the scene			1
a post-mortem examination found he had died instantly from severe head and body injuries			0
it also emerged that mr @entity0 was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition , which was probably what had caused him to collapse into the road			1
it was established that he could not have been there any longer than 45 seconds			0
@entity2 's car was travelling at or just above the 30mph , which investigators said would have given him at least five seconds to stop or take evasive action			2
the injuries showed that the 4x4 had run right over mr @entity0 and dragged him just 12 yards down the carriageway			1
in mitigation , @entity146 said neither speed nor alcohol were a factor in the ' sad tragic event ' , but he admitted @entity24 's later actions ' aggravated ' what had taken place			1
' everyone has made a mistake and almost always they do n't result in any consequences let alone the death of an individual , ' he said			0
@entity20 ( pictured ) heard @entity24 made no attempt to seek help before abandoning mr @entity0 and driving home to bed ' his mistake cost the life of mr @entity0 and he will have to live with that for the rest of his life			1
' he can not explain what he did afterwards , but he understands it was totally wrong and why mr @entity0 's family feel like they do			1
' he said @entity24 , of @entity174 , @entity19 , was a well - respected member of his local community , who had worked hard all his life running his family 's farm and butcher 's business			2
the judge described mr @entity0 as ' a kind and generous man ' who was dealing with advanced @entity10 with ' characteristic courage '			1
he accepted nothing he could say would bring his family any comfort			0
judge @entity191 told @entity24 his actions ' beggared belief '			1
he said : ' if events had taken a different turn his family could have perhaps forgiven you but they can never come to terms with what you did next			0
' there is nothing to suggest you are a callous man , you were in deep shock and now you have expressed your remorse			0
' but that can not excuse what you did			0
grotesquely you dragged his body to the side of the road and there you left him			2
' the judge added : ' you made a conscious decision to drive off , confident that you would not be traced and if you were you could maintain the lie			0
' it absolutely beggars belief you could leave mr @entity0 where he was and you could drive home , make no call to anyone and go to bed			1
' you either did not think about or care about who happened upon the scene that you left behind			0
those people did what they could to give him some dignity			0
' @entity2 , who pleaded guilty to causing mr @entity0 's death by careless driving on march 23 last year and failing to report an accident , was told he must serve at least half his sentence in jail			1
passing sentence , judge @entity191 added : ' you lied and said the body was cold and that you had found it in the road			2
you also lied about the taxi driver and that you had done what you could , and then left the scene			0
' i 'm afraid they were all calculated lies			0
