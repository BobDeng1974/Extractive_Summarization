withdrawn : diacetyl was discovered inside a vip butterscotch flavour liquid refill bottle a potentially harmful chemical linked to lung disease has been found in an e-cigarette sold in @entity7 , it was claimed today			1
diacetyl - a chemical safe to eat , but not to inhale - was discovered inside a vip butterscotch flavour liquid refill bottle purchased at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
laboratory tests were carried out on four types of liquid , with the other three safe - but the butterscotch product has since been withdrawn			1
@entity18 - head of retail distribution at @entity20 , one of @entity7 ’s biggest e-cigarette firms - said the company had already detected the chemical through its testing , and the product should have been withdrawn a week before it was purchased			1
she told @entity28 investigative show @entity27 : ‘ because of the small amount the vaper would actually consume it was deemed in the short term there would be no health concerns			2
‘ long term , yes there could well be - however , we decided it was a withdrawal rather than a recall of the product and that was based on @entity40 ( @entity41 ) guidelines			2
this is our first issue in five years			2
' we sell millions of bottles a year			0
we are very sorry it has happened , we are investigating how it has happened ’			0
investigators spoke to dr @entity47 , a consultant physician in respiratory and general medicine			0
dr @entity47 , who works for @entity51 , said : ‘ @entity52 - is associated with an unusual but well - established lung condition called " popcorn worker 's lung "			1
in those individuals it has caused a very serious lung condition			1
' he added : ‘ e-cigarettes are as yet entirely unregulated so at the moment if you go out on to the streets , buy an e-cigarette you have no idea and i have no idea what you are putting into your lungs			0
’ it comes after the @entity79 insisted last week that electronic cigarettes should be banned from indoors and face a raft of new curbs over safety fears			0
the organisation , which is the public health arm of the @entity87 , claimed they pose a risk to bystanders of ‘ toxicant ’ emissions and warned there was limited evidence they help smokers quit			0
a report said legal steps need to be taken to end the use of e-cigarettes in public indoor spaces and workplaces – and to ban sales to children			0
around 2.1million @entity7 use battery - powered e-cigarettes , which allow users to inhale nicotine but avoid the harm caused by tobacco smoke			1
the @entity7 ’s @entity109 decided they must be regulated as medicines to make them ‘ safer and more effective ’ , but this is not due until 2016			0
but a major scientific review last month , which looked at 81 studies of e-cigarettes , found they caused less harm than smoking			0
bronchiolitis obliterans is an inflammatory obstruction of the bronchioles , which are the lung 's smallest airways			1
the condition restricts the flow of air out of the lungs , causing a dry cough and wheezing			0
one cause of the condition is thought to be the inhalation of diacetyl			1
the chemical is used to make butter - like flavouring in microwaveable popcorn			1
the condition first came to public attention when eight former employees of the @entity139 - @entity138 popcorn plant in @entity140 developed it in the late 1990s			2
and two years ago a court in @entity143 awarded £ 4million in damages to a man who developed the condition after eating a few packs of popcorn every day for ten years .			2
