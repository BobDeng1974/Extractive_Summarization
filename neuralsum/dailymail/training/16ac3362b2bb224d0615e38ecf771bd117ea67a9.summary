a great defender on the pitch , @entity0 needs to find a way to protect his reputation off it			1
whether he has the drive to keep on trying in his current position as @entity9 ’s manager is another question altogether			1
for the first time in @entity9 ’s plummet down the @entity17 table , the former hero of @entity13 ’s backline is considering his future			1
that will certainly appeal to the significant section of the crowd chanting ‘ we want @entity0 out ’ in the second half of this baffling performance			2
their anger is fuelled by a run of one win in 17 games ; his own despondency came to the surface after watching his team batter a struggling side and emerge with nothing			1
i think answering that kind of question i would maybe need some time			2
but usually i am not a quitter , i am a fighter			2
’ to think , this is a club that reached the play - offs in each of the past two seasons but now sits in the bottom three			1
@entity0 was given a vote of confidence at a board meeting on tuesday , but for how long will that last ? certainly , he wo n’t get as many chances as his side had here			2
they dominated possession and still managed to lose to a 15th - minute strike from @entity40 , plucked from @entity108 in the summer			1
‘ best 250 grand i ’ve spent in my life , ’ said @entity109			1
the booing for @entity0 started in the second half			2
‘ i think that is normal , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ some of the fans are getting impatient			2
‘ i have always been prepared in my life for everything			2
i am prepared that i could have a car crash and never walk			0
in this job sometimes it is not going your way and you are in the situation			0
in my mind i am ready for it			0
( but ) it is not nice at all			0
’ the @entity38 supporters celebrate after @entity40 put their side 1 - 0 up against @entity9 on friday night @entity38 goalkeeper @entity67 needed treatment from his side 's physio during the game veteran @entity67 ( second left ) flies out of his goal to challenge for the ball with @entity55 neither has it been too cheerful at @entity38			1
they had one win in 15 coming in and a 5 - 1 battering against @entity137 last time out			0
here , they were happy to play the counter-puncher when they were n’t running down the clock			0
in @entity40 , they had what @entity9 apparently lacked – a man capable of putting a ball in the net			1
the 26 - year - old ’s finish after quarter of an hour was delightful			0
@entity71 , as was often the case , was the instigator with a cross that @entity9 failed to clear			1
the ball fell for @entity75 , who miscued a shot into @entity40 ’s path and the striker chipped @entity50 for his fourth goal in 10 starts			1
@entity60 , on loan at the south - coast club , was unable to make a mark on the game @entity55 ( centre ) takes a tumble as he vies for the aerial ball with @entity78 the police line up next to the away end as the @entity38 fans chant at the @entity9 supporters @entity9 ’s retaliation was to shoot on sight			1
@entity55 grazed the bar with a free - kick from 30 yards and @entity48 tried his luck from 25			0
the lack of deeper thinking was obvious			0
when @entity60 did get an opening after a @entity178 throughball in the 48th minute , he shot wide			0
his header eight minutes later was even less effective			0
@entity178 also had a decent chance , as did @entity180			0
@entity67 did not have to be at his best to keep them out ; he probably did not need to resort to the time wasting that saw him booked in the second half			0
@entity184 ( left ) of @entity9 takes a shot as @entity71 attempts to block @entity38 's @entity75 ( right ) battles for possession of the ball with @entity9 's @entity54 ‘ this is a fantastic division , ’ @entity109 said			1
‘ anybody can beat anyone			0
we got things wrong in our last game and it goes down to performance and believing in ourselves			1
‘ we managed to settle , got in front and then proved we can defend			0
let ’s see if we can get two in a row			0
’ what next for @entity9 ? they are not happy in these parts and regardless of the official attendance statistics , the fans are voting with their feet			1
whether @entity0 walks with them remains to be seen			0
@entity109 , whose previous visit to the @entity43 was in the playoffs with @entity210 , barks instructions @entity180 of @entity9 battles past @entity71 during the @entity17 match at the @entity214			1

before the game , both @entity38 and @entity9 were struggling at the bottom
a single @entity40 goal was enough to separate the two sides
@entity109 's men move up to 17th , five points away from the drop zone
@entity9 stay in the bottom three ahead of the remaining *saturday* *fixtures*
