a @entity1 's worker who picked up the bill for hungry first responders after they battled local fires has returned to work to find she no longer has a job			2
@entity6 , a 23 - year - old single mother who works two jobs in @entity8 , @entity9 , said she simply wanted to show her appreciation for two groups of firefighters working in sub-zero temperatures			1
so when a group of firefighters came into the store , where @entity6 was working a morning shift as manager last week , and ordered 25 sandwiches , she took $ 83 from her own wallet to pay for it			1
' just because i appreciate everything they do , ' she explained to @entity25			0
desperate to treat these emergency responders too , she texted her boss to see if the company would foot the bill , aware that they often bought food for police officers , @entity6 said			1
but the boss said that @entity41 would not be allowed to donate the sandwiches			2
so @entity6 tried the corporate offices instead - but she got the same answer			1
refusing to let the firefighters pay , she and two workers paid from their own pockets			1
but some emergency responders called her boss to complain , saying they had made her feel obligated			0
' you opened a whole bees ' nest , ' her boss reportedly told @entity6			1
when she returned the next day , she was fired			1
her co-workers who also chipped in for the bill did not lose their jobs			2
denial : she had asked her bosses if they donated food , but was told they did not			1
the company says it did not fire her for paying for the food - but because she swore at a superior , which she denies thankful : @entity61 officer @entity60 said he was shocked to hear @entity6 had been fired her boss claimed she had sworn at a superior , but @entity6 , who has worked for the company for eight years and is putting herself through nursing school , said that 's not true			1
' i did say this is " freaking " ridiculous , ' she admitted			0
' but it was not implied to anybody			0
' @entity69 , the owner of the @entity1 's said the company was an ' ardent supporter ' of local first responders			0
' we are aware that certain allegations have been made concerning the reasons for @entity6 ’s termination , ' he said			1
' out of respect for ms. @entity6 and her privacy , it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the reasons she is no longer employed by our organization			2
' still , it should be pointed out that the allegations are absolutely not true			0
we would never penalize an employee for showing appropriate gratitude for the work of our firefighters			0
' generous : @entity6 is a single mother to twin girls but said she has already had other job offers @entity61 firefighters said they were saddened to hear @entity6 had been fired			1
' it was a shock , ' said @entity61 officer @entity60			0
' it was a sad affair because a gentleman lost a home [ in the fire ]			0
and it 's even worse because we know now that this gal apparently lost her job because of it			0
' @entity6 , mother to two young twin girls , said she is putting the ordeal behind her and has already received several job offers after her story gained local press			2
she added : ' i wish the communities would change and help each other out ... and if losing my job is going to speak out to the community , then that ’s what it ’s going to do			0
' see below for video			0

@entity6 paid out $ 83 from her wallet after firefighters ordered breakfast from her store in @entity8 , @entity9
when another department ordered , she wanted to extend the *generosity* - but her bosses said the store did not donate food
so again she paid out of pocket for the $ 70 bill
the next day she found out she had been fired ; the store claims it was because she swore after being refused but she denies this
