each and every time you board a plane , it can sometimes seem as though the flight attendants and pilots are communicating in an entirely different language			1
whether barking codes to each other over the loudspeaker or simply relaying news in difficult - to - understand abbreviations , it 's not uncommon for passengers to wonder just what exactly is going on			1
now @entity16 senior first officer , @entity15 , has spoken to @entity17 to reveal the most unusual jargon used on flights , and what it really means ... @entity16 senior first officer and author , @entity15 , shares the strangest in - flight jargon the heavy ' this is n't a reference to my waistline ! ' @entity15 tells @entity17			1
' @entity16 will always have tow pilots flying at any one time , but will have three and sometimes four pilots on its long - haul services , such as those flights to @entity34 or @entity35			1
' the heavy pilot takes turns flying , allowing one of the other pilots to take a break			1
' the en - suite fleet ' this is an affectionate term for the 747 fleet , ' he explains			1
' the 747 has not just a very cosy bunk in which to take our breaks - on flights with heavy crew , that is - but also has a toilet inside the cockpit			1
' positioning refers to when crew members travel as passengers , often when a route is switching upon arrival positioning ' this occurs when crew members travel as passengers , ' @entity15 reveals			1
often it happens when ' a route is switching to a new aircraft type and a crew must already be in place overseas to bring the first flight home			2
' ' it has a more colourful name in @entity71 : deadheading			0
' to remember , just think @entity73 and the film @entity72			0
' there - and - backs are routes that allow the crew to make it back home - to @entity79 - in time for dinner there - and - back ' it sounds like something @entity84 would have written about , but for an air crew , it refers to a trip that runs from home - @entity79 to a city like @entity88 or @entity89 and then back on the same day			1
' there - and - backs are always popular , ' he adds			1
' we may even land in time for dinner ! ' if we do have to stay the night in a hotel , it 's called a nightstop			0
' every airline has their own call - sign , and for @entity16 , all aircraft identify themselves as ' speedbirds ' @entity101 ' every airline has its own call - sign , which consists of a name followed by a version of the flight number , ' @entity15 explains			1
' for many airlines , the call - sign is simply the name of the airline , but the @entity16 call - sign is ' speedbird , ' a name with plenty of history behind it			2
' for example then , @entity16 flight 117 from @entity117 to @entity118 will identify itself on the radio as @entity121			2
' pilots often refer to air traffic controllers who align and space out arriving jets at a busy airport as ' directors ' yes , they have a few oft - used phrases , too			1
slam - click ( er ) air stewardess @entity131 , who works for a @entity133 carrier , explains that this is when a crew member goes to the hotel and does not emerge again until it ’s time to leave			1
as in : slamming the door and clicking the lock			0
can be used as a noun or a verb			0
( ' i ’m so tired i ’m just gon na slam - click			2
' or ' you wo n’t see her for dinner			0
she ’s a slam - clicker			2
) ’ pink eye similar to a red eye flight , a pink eye is just short of a long - haul overnight journey			1
a red eye is a flight that touches the 1 am hour , according to flight attendant , @entity154 , so a flight that goes to midnight would be a pink eye			2
coach roach used wryly , usually for flight attendants who prefer working in the main / coach cabin			1
' business ? no thanks			0
i ’m a coach roach all the way , baby ! ' crotch watch nickname for walking through the cabin to do a seatbelt check			0
also called a ' groin scan '			0
the director no , it 's not the name of an upcoming @entity174 film , it 's the term applied to certain air traffic controllers			0
' those who align and space out arriving jets at a busy airport are called directors , ' he says			0
' when pilots , landing at @entity117 for example , hear that it 's time to contact the @entity117 director , it 's a sign that one of the most finely choreographed parts of the flight is about to begin			1
' the @entity191 ' this is the area of the taxiways near a runway where an aircraft may be sent to wait - out of the way of other aircraft			2
' typically , it occurs if a flight has a time restriction on its departure , either because its direction of flight is busier than that of other aircraft or because there 's inclement weather at its destination			2
' moral of the story ? when you hear this term , you may want to send a quick text to let your loved ones know you 'll be landing late			0
pilots often make reference to the jets , which is the streaming quality of the air , when looking at weather charts the jets you may think that this is in reference to the gigantic planes that the pilots are captaining , but it 's actually in reference to jet streams : the very high , fast winds that speed or impede the aircraft 's journey			2
' the ' jet ' in jet stream comes from the streaming quality of the air , not the aircraft we most associate with them , ' @entity15 explains			1
' though it is a pleasing coincidence			0
' i might ask where the jets are this morning while looking at a weather chart or in flight we may comment on how strong the jets are			0
' often , the airline staff is required to report the total number of customers and crew , called souls on board souls on board ' when we operate at certain airports , we 're required to report the total number of customers and crew on the aircraft , ' he adds			0
' we call this souls on board			0
' ' in aviation , which has so much new terminology and technological jargon , this is one of those pleasing phrases that sounds all but antique			0
' essentially , this a fancy name for the plane 's head count			0
senior first office @entity15 is also the author of the upcoming book , skyfaring : a journey with a pilot , which will be available in stores and online on april 2 .			1
