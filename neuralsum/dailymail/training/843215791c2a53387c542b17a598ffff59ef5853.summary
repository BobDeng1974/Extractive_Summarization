by @entity0 published : 07:36 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 31 may 2013 walking dead : @entity2 from @entity3 has been diagnosed with rare condition called @entity6 syndrome where he is convinced he is a zombie a man diagnosed with a rare zombie condition today told of his nine years of hell thinking he was the living dead			1
@entity2 , 57 , was convinced he had died despite a botched suicide attempt - and even took to hanging around in graveyards			1
he believed his brain had ' fried ' after trying to electrocute himself and must be dead , even though he was still breathing			1
doctors diagnosed @entity15 - otherwise known as walking corpse syndrome - one of the rarest diseases in the world , affecting just a few hundred people			1
delusional sufferers believe they are dead , or that parts of their body no longer exist , and often die from starvation because they feel they no longer have to eat			2
@entity2 , a former water contractor from @entity3 , @entity26 , woke up after a botched suicide attempt amazed he was able to talk - because he was convinced he had no brain			1
he said : ' i just got annoyed			2
i did n't know how i could speak or do anything with no brain because as far as i was concerned i had n't got one			2
' my mind was blank			2
i could n't hold any information in it			2
i took no pleasure from anything			0
@entity38 : image shows the areas of @entity2 's brain which are underactive ( coloured in blue ) in comparison with a healthy person rare condition : the scans show how mr @entity2 's brain has changed the way it performs with large areas now underactive ( coloured in blue ) compared to a healthy person ' i lost my sense of small and my sense of taste			1
there was no point in eating because i was dead			0
it was a waste of time speaking because i never had anything to say			0
' the final nail in the coffin came when @entity2 felt compelled to go to his local cemetery because he felt it was the only place he could fit in			1
cases of @entity15 date back to 1788 but it was formally identified by @entity68 neurologist @entity67 in 1880			1
among the handful of cases over the years was a 53 - year - old woman in @entity72 who in 2008 claimed that she stank like rotting fish because she was dead			0
like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia , @entity67 ’s is another form of delusional psychosis , the only self - certifiable form of its kind			0
those with this condition often describe a loss of blood , organs and / or body parts			0
this distorted reality is caused by a malfunction in an area of the brain called the fusiform gyrus , which recognizes faces , and also in the amygdala , an almond - shaped set of neurons that processes your emotions			1
the combination is a lack of recognition when viewing familiar faces ( even the face of the sufferer ) , leaving the person feeling disconnected with reality			0
there is no current cure for @entity15			1
common treatments include anti-depressants and anti-psychotics , as well as the controversial electroconvulsive therapy			0
he said : ' i just felt i might as well stay there			0
it was the closest i could get to death			0
the police would come and get me , though , and take me back home			0
' baffled doctors put @entity2 in touch with neurologist @entity120 , from the @entity121 and @entity122 at the @entity123 , in @entity124			1
mr @entity122 said : ' it 's the first and only time my secretary has said to me , " it 's really important for you to come and speak to this patient because he 's telling me he 's dead "			0
' he was a really unusual patient			0
' @entity2 's recovery began after scans found that levels of activity in parts of his brain were so low they almost matched the brain of somebody in a vegetative state			1
mr @entity122 added : ' i 've been analysing scans for 15 years and i 've never seen anyone who was on his feet , who was interacting with people , with such an abnormal scan result			0
' @entity2 's brain function resembled that of someone during anaesthesia or sleep			1
' years of psychotherapy and drug treatment , combined with help from carers and his brother , mean @entity2 gradually recovered and he is no longer in the grip of the disorder			2
' i do n't feel brain dead any more , ' he said			2
' i ca n't say i am really back to normal , but i feel a lot better now			0
' nightmare : @entity2 , from @entity3 , began hanging around cemeteries after suffering from @entity15 which made him believe he was dead morbid : @entity2 said he started hanging around cemeteries because it was the only place he thought he fitted in after suffering from @entity15 - also referred to as @entity15			1
