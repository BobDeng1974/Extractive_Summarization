the prime minister said the country is well on its way to being ' the unaffordable energy capital of the world ' and that 's the reason for the government 's review of the @entity9 , report @entity20			1
' we should be the affordable energy capital of the world , not the unaffordable energy capital of the world and that ’s why the carbon tax must go and that ’s why we ’re reviewing the @entity9 , ' he told the publication			0
clean energy companies have responded to these claims saying mr @entity1 completely exaggerated the impact that the target would have , and in the long run the nation would be better off financially and environmentally from the scheme			1
