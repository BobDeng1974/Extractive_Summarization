one in nine @entity1 men have paid for sex , according to a new study			2
and the likeliest to do so are 25 to 34 - year - old single men in managerial or professional occupations , and those who have had a high number of partners			1
the research , published in the journal @entity11 , revealed that 3.6 per cent of the 6,000 men surveyed admitted visiting prostitutes in the past five years			1
one in nine @entity1 men have paid for sex , pictured is @entity17 as @entity18 in @entity19 with a client lead scientist dr @entity21 , from @entity22 , said : ‘ the picture that emerges does not necessarily fit the stereotype of the lonely older man			0
‘ in fact , men who pay for sex are more likely to be young professionals with many unpaid sexual partners			1
many report other hedonistic and risky behaviours including heavy drinking and drug taking			0
’ men who paid for sex were also more than twice as likely as average men to have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the past five years			2
men who used prostitutes made up 15.6 per cent of all reported @entity11 diagnoses in male population			1
men who paid for sex were more than twice as likely as average men to have been diagnosed with an @entity11 in the past five years they also reported an average of 31.6 lifetime sexual partners - more than twice the average for the male population			1
dr @entity48 said : ‘ men who pay for sex are evidently at high risk of infection , but this does not necessarily mean that the @entity54 are spread through their paid sex			2
‘ instead , we found that these men report engaging in other risky sexual behaviours , such as having concurrent - or overlapping - partners , and so should be considered a core - group for sexual health interventions and services			1
’ the findings come from the third @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , conducted between 2010 - 2012 by researchers from @entity22 , the @entity66 and @entity67			0
a total of 6,108 men aged 16 - 74 answered questions about paying for sex in a computer - assisted self - interview			0
the study focused on men as the proportion of women who reported paying for sex was only around 0.1 per cent			0
among men who reported ever having paid for sex , 62.6 per cent had done so outside the @entity1 at least once - most commonly in @entity80 and @entity81			1
this may be driven by ‘ hotspots ’ such as @entity84 and @entity85 , said the researchers			0
‘ paying for sex may seem more permissible abroad , at a place removed from the day - to - day lives of most men , ’ dr @entity48 added			0
‘ paid sex can also be more readily available in certain areas so if men mention to their health professional that they will be travelling to destinations known for sex tourism , and especially those where the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and @entity101 is high , then it would be opportunistic to have a conversation about safe sex			0
