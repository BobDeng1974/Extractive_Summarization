by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 10:48 est , 16 january 2014 few are the stars who can boast the staying power of @entity4 , a woman whose modelling career has spanned an incredible 20 years			1
despite hitting the big 4 - 0 , she remains an icon - particularly in the eyes of artist and erstwhile journalist @entity10 , who is celebrating her birthday with the launch of a retrospective dedicated to portraits of the model			1
ever the icon : despite hitting the big 4 - 0 , @entity4 remains as popular as ever , says artist @entity10 glamorous : the model 's longevity and rock n ' roll exploits have turned her into a legend ' the retrospective has been produced from my perspective , ' he explains			1
' @entity4 's been in the public eye as long as i 've been working in the newspaper industry , so i 've seen countless images of her appear on the picture desk			2
' the new exhibition includes some of the most iconic photographs of @entity4 ever taken , among them several that have come from newspaper archives and been reworked by the artist			0
starting with early portraits of the future supermodel as a 14 - year - old , the exhibition , at the @entity36 in @entity37 , charts her progress from @entity43 © nue to icon			1
future supermodel : @entity10 's retrospective begins with early portraits of @entity4 at the start of her career daring style : @entity4 in 1991 and dressed as a geisha at a @entity51 show in 1993 ' @entity4 has done things get way on her terms , ' adds @entity10			1
' she 's never been a slave to convention [ and ] that is a quality i admire			0
' although @entity10 makes no secret of his penchant for creating work featuring the model , he 's no stranger to working with other celebrities			2
none , however , are typical tabloid favourites , with @entity10 insisting that he 's in the business of portraying icons , not ' celebs '			0
thus , other series feature @entity69 , @entity71 and @entity72 , although he admits that few inspire him quite so much as the @entity75 supermodel			0
icon : @entity4 in a @entity10 print based on early photos from her @entity80 collaboration masterclass : @entity4 shows why she 's worth it in a photo taken to promote her final collaboration with @entity80 ' there are many celebrities but few become legends , ' he adds			1
' @entity4 has achieved that status			0
' despite spending hours contemplating ms @entity4 , @entity10 reveals that he still ca n't quite put his finger on what makes her so special			2
' if i knew exactly what makes @entity4 a legend , or an icon as opposed to just a celebrity , i would probably be in artist management , ' he begins			0
' but @entity4 's silence is all part of the mystery and the reason why we love her			0
' either way , it 's probably best not to analyse it too closely or you might destroy it			0
then where would we be ! ' 40 : a @entity110 opens today and runs until 15 february at @entity111 in @entity37 and online at @entity113 legend : @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , love her , a 2011 print by @entity10 appears in the retrospective			1
