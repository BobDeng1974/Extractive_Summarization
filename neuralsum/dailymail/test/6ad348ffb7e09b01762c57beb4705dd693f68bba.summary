whether he 's your coach , manager or interim , @entity1 wins trophies			1
the @entity7 's name is being uttered once again across the boardrooms of @entity9 this morning			0
his @entity12 side 's 4 - 1 demolition of @entity13 in the @entity14 quarter final last night gave that ominous feeling that silverware is once again within his grasp			1
he may be demanding , occasionally abrasive and often expensive but ultimately @entity1 gets results			1
since 2002 , @entity1 has won 12 trophies with @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity12			1
@entity12 manager @entity1 saw his side beat @entity13 4 - 1 in the @entity14 @entity25 and @entity1 celebrate after beating @entity13 in @entity26 the 55 - year - old is out of contract this summer and it makes him a man in demand			1
@entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 are all considering changes as are @entity36 and @entity37			1
while @entity38 is destined for the role at @entity40 ' , @entity1 will take stock of what offers arrive on his doorstep			2
his ideal is to return to @entity45 and his comfortable @entity47 home overlooking the @entity48 where his family , wife @entity50 and beloved daughters @entity53 and @entity54 , are settled			0
the reality is , here , jobs of the calibre @entity1 wants are scarce and the opportunities could come with a caveat			2
@entity32 , should they dispense with @entity61 , ultimately want @entity62 ; his contract at @entity64 makes that difficult though and @entity66 's inexperience leaves them with a dilemma			1
should they try @entity1 ? it goes against certain principles , @entity69 wants a fluid attacking style to bring glory and @entity1 is seen as pragmatic yet tactically very astute			2
yet , @entity74 , @entity21 and @entity75 may not have danced through @entity32 's midfield so easily in recent weeks had he been in charge			1
@entity1 has won the @entity14 / @entity14 twice with @entity20 and @entity23 preparation is everything to him , almost laborious			1
his players are given briefings , tailored dvds , weak points to work on or to attack			0
his pointers are not negative , they 're smart			0
when @entity23 beat @entity87 in the @entity14 final of 2013 , @entity86 revealed how @entity1 had told them to target the back post where @entity87 goalkeeper @entity90 was vulnerable			1
they won with a far post header from @entity93			0
ironically , @entity1 has been viewed as wreckless in @entity94 this season for not setting his team with greater emphasis on defence			2
they have lost to @entity100 and @entity101 but dominated			0
it prompted under - pressure president @entity103 to demand his players be locked away in a training camp			0
film producer @entity103 does love a drama			0
giving players a cuddle has never been @entity1 's forte , nor saying that he loves them but he does give them a platform to improve			1
@entity1 famously guided @entity21 to the @entity111 in 2005 @entity1 won the @entity112 with @entity21 in 2006 on penalties against @entity36 @entity114 was told exactly where and how he would play as he and @entity116 brought the best out of @entity118 , @entity86 excelled at @entity23 , @entity119 grew and @entity120 has transformed from an £ 8m @entity34 squad player to one now valued at £ 20m by @entity12			1
he 's a man who would certainly have a plan for messrs @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
@entity36 could offer the project he craves should @entity127 move on			2
a rich football tradition , new stadium ; if the finance is right , @entity1 would embrace it			2
@entity1 loves a project and would relish being an underdog biting at the coat tails of the @entity135 's elite			1
he was sold on one at @entity12			2
at first it worked , the squad was competitive and challenged for @entity139 but last summer they did n't invest as heavily as their rivals and the squad has been stretched			0
it may sound familiar to @entity21 fans but he still looks like delivering @entity12 's first @entity9 semi final for 25 years and @entity111 qualification remains in sight			1
@entity1 got the best out of @entity86 during his time at @entity23 @entity120 has been transformed from a squad player at @entity34 to a star at @entity12 under @entity1 life has not been easy at @entity12 but for now he will endeavour to finish on a high			1
the @entity13 performance is a timely reminder of what he can put in place though he ca n't help but demand more			0
' we put in great games against @entity100 and @entity101 , yet played worse against @entity160 and won 3 - 0 , ' said @entity1			1
' we played against the second best team in the @entity162 and these players deserve credit			0
we still lack experience to control the match and not concede goals			0
we work on tactics , but can still improve			0
what i do not like is hearing people say the players are unprofessional or undisciplined			0
' @entity127 's future at @entity36 is uncertain as is @entity61 's at @entity32 and @entity1 could be considered by both clubs should they be in the need for a new manager asked about his future he emphasised the need for change should he stay in @entity94			1
' i have n’t decided anything			0
it ’s not hard for me to work with @entity12 , but i have to understand the final objective , the planning , the investment in a training centre and stadium , ' he said			2
' if we go forward , then we ’ll see			0
the president has invested and worked hard in these years , but now we have to see what the plans are before deciding if we ’ll continue together			0
' for @entity1 the door is once again ajar and invitations are welcome .			2

@entity1 has won 12 trophies with @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity12 since 2002
@entity1 's contract at @entity12 is up in the summer and he is set to a manager in demand
