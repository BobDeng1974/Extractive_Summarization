a new technique that involves folding the stomach into pleats is being tested as a potentially less risky form of weight - loss surgery			1
it involves no incisions , the entire procedure can be done via a tube passed down the throat and the patient can go home the same day			1
weight - loss surgery , also called bariatric surgery , is available on the @entity13 to those who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( @entity16 ) of over 40 — or to those who have a @entity16 of 35 to 40 , but whose weight is causing a serious , obesity - related health complaint , such as type 2 diabetes			1
currently , the procedures most often performed involve using a gastric band that reduces the stomach size , so less food is needed to make you feel full , or a gastric bypass			1
this involves re-routing the stomach to join a lower section of the intestines , reducing the size of the stomach and bypassing part of the small intestine , cutting the amount of calories and nutrients absorbed			1
the other option is a sleeve gastrectomy , involving removal of part of the stomach			2
however , these all involve incisions in the abdomen , which carries risk of infection ( affecting around one in 20 ) , blood clots in the legs or lungs and internal bleeding , each of which affects around one in 100			0
patients also need to stay in hospital for a least a night , if not longer			0
the new technique , called @entity71 , is less invasive and , researchers say , causes less post-operative pain , has reduced risk of infection and leaves no external scars			1
the surgeon works through a tube or endoscope , which goes down the throat into the stomach			1
once in place , it is used to gather up the stomach wall and lining			2
a stitch is pushed through the gathered tissue and ‘ anchors ’ placed on either side to hold the fold in place			0
the process is repeated , making several folds to shrink the stomach and prevent it expanding to accommodate food			1
the technique has already been tested in small trials in @entity98			2
in a @entity101 study , 22 patients reported feeling full faster after the procedure and , after a year , had lost an average 62 per cent of their excess weight			2
most returned to work without bandages or signs of surgery within two to three days , unlike traditional bariatric surgery , where it can take weeks or months to resume normal activities			1
in a @entity101 study , most of the patients returned to work without bandages or any signs of having had the surgery within two to three days ( file image ) around 300 people are now taking part in a new trial to further test its efficacy at a number of centres in the @entity122 — the treatment is already approved for @entity125 use			1
dr @entity126 , of @entity127 , who is leading the new trial , says : ‘ it could mean tens of thousands of patients may have an incredibly compelling new option to consider if they ’ve struggled to lose weight with diet and exercise , but are n’t candidates for , or are not prepared to accept the risk of , traditional bariatric surgery			2
’ @entity137 , of the @entity138 , says : ‘ this is a very interesting concept and seems plausible			0
it is less invasive and more patient - friendly than other therapies — and that is something we really do need			0
‘ over the past ten years , there have been a succession of advances in bariatric surgery , and we have moved from the scalpel to the endoscope			0
this could be a very useful treatment			0
’ meanwhile , obese adults who lose at least 5 per cent of their body weight will feel and sleep better , according to research from the @entity157 in the @entity122 in a two - year study involving 390 obese adults following a variety of weight - loss programmes , those who lost at least 5 per cent of their weight at six months managed to sleep 21.6 minutes more than at their heaviest			0
those who lost less weight had only 1.2 minutes more sleep each night			0
similarly , patients who lost more than 5 per cent reported improvements to their symptoms of depression , compared with participants who lost less than 5 per cent .			0

it is called @entity71 and is far less invasive
technique folds the stomach into pleats , preventing *expansion* for food
the whole procedure is done via a tube that is passed down the throat
most people can return to work within two or three days of the surgery
