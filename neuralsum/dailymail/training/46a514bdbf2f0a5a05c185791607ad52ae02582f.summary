drop : viewing figures sank to just 47,000 for the third episode of the fifth series of @entity9 on @entity4 , down from 355,000 during the premiere of the fourth series when it was shown on @entity22 new dynamic : @entity24 as advertising boss @entity25 with his wife , @entity26 , played by @entity27 , in episode two of season five that ’s an alarming drop from the 355,000 viewers who watched the premiere of the fourth series when it was on @entity22			1
it is understood that @entity4 is paying about £ 250,000 an episode for the glossy 1960s drama			1
based on tuesday ’s figures , that amounts to more than £ 5 per viewer			0
while the show , starring @entity24 as @entity25 and @entity38 as @entity39 , picks up more viewers from repeated episodes and ‘ consolidated ’ viewing through video recorders , the ratings have surprised many within the industry			0
it has been claimed that @entity4 ’s deal for the rights to @entity9 is worth more than £ 5million , which is thought to cover two series			1
poor return : @entity52 as @entity53 with @entity25 and @entity54 as @entity55 in a show which , based on tuesday 's figures , is costing @entity4 around £ 5 per viewer at the time of the new deal being agreed in 2010 , it was said that the @entity2 could not compete with @entity4 ’s ' deep pockets ' as the licence - fee funded broadcaster looked to reduce its spend on acquired programmes			2
a @entity4 insider said : ‘ @entity9 is the centrepiece of the @entity69 channel			2
but there has been a huge gap from when it was on the @entity2 to the new series airing on @entity4			1
‘ @entity4 do not care about the ratings			2
if it makes thousands subscribe to @entity4 or stops thousands unsubscribing , then it is ok			2
' but that is a lot of money to pay for @entity9			0
’ the series was delayed due to contract negotiations between the show ’s creator @entity82 and the @entity11 network @entity84			0
losing ratings : when aired on the @entity2 , the show , which also stars @entity87 as @entity88 ( left ) and @entity38 as @entity39 ( right ) , was watched by 1.5million once the @entity90 repeat was included some have suggested that the programme has suffered particularly badly after switching from the @entity2 to @entity4 because it appeals to a certain type of viewer who may be reluctant to take out a subscription with @entity97 ’s satellite giant			1
@entity9 ’s figures compare with the opening episode of fantasy action series @entity100 , which got 522,000 viewers on the same channel			0
despite this , @entity4 has said @entity9 is rating well			0
the fifth series launched last week with two episodes aired consecutively			0
the first attracted 98,000 viewers but the following installment dropped to 45,000			0
according to sources , when the show aired on the @entity2 it was watched by 1.5million once you include the @entity90 repeat , which aired after it had originally been shown on @entity22			2
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ in @entity4 homes @entity9 has never been more popular			1
' when you look at those who watched the first episode of @entity9 live , or caught up through @entity4 + or on - demand , it was the most watched episode in @entity4 homes ever , and by some margin			1
’ ‘ we ’re delighted with the response from @entity4 customers and will continue to invest in the shows that create more value for our existing customers and give more people a reason to join @entity4			0
’ according to the satellite broadcaster ’s figures , in @entity4 homes , the satellite broadcaster ’s ratings were 35 per cent higher than the highest rating for a premiere performance of a @entity9 episode when it was shown on @entity22			1
