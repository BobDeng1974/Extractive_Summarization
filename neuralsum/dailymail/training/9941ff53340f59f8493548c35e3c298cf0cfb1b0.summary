like this , but smaller : @entity1 has now released three generations of @entity3 - and rumours suggest a baby brother is on the way @entity1 is planning to launch an assault against the burgeoning @entity9 tablet market by releasing an ' @entity10 ' - at a loss - making price of around £ 150 , according to new claims			1
the bargain - basement priced tablet will even feature the same ' @entity15 featured on its big brother , bringing the same 3.1million pixels to a smaller 7 - 8 " display			0
sources told @entity1 fansite imore that the aggressively - priced tablet will launch in october this year , with @entity1 potentially selling the sub- $ 250 tablet at a loss in order to leave no room for competition			1
with @entity1 sitting on cash reserves of $ 100bn , the tech giant should at least be able to stomach such a move financially			1
@entity30 reported : ' today 's claim says that @entity1 is going to step - up the pressure on @entity9 tablet manufacturers with an ipad mini that will sell for a surprisingly low $ 200 - 250			1
' that 's a bit hard to accept in the light of the other major claim this rumor makes , that the ipad mini will keep the full - sized @entity3 's 2048x1536 resolution			2
' if this is true , @entity1 might have to take a serious cut to its margins , if not sell the mini at a loss			2
considering the kind of cash @entity1 has on hand , though , it might be willing to take the hit just to help kill - off competition from @entity9 tablets			1
' if the @entity3 sells for $ 250 in the @entity54 , that would translate to £ 150 in the @entity55 , although whether @entity1 would respect currency rates is up for debate			1
with the screen as a premium feature , it is likely sacrifices will be made in other parts of the tablet , such as reduced storage space of , for instance , @entity66 for your apps , videos and music			0
this will likely cause issues for users as that amount of space will be used up quickly , marking this out as very much a budget tablet			0
however , it will also appeal to people who want an @entity3 for casual browsing and occasional use of apps and movies , but who are not willing to shell out £ 400 for the bigger brother			0
@entity86 and another website , @entity88 , have separately heard that @entity1 has already built the seven - inch device , and the only decision left is whether to ' go to market '			2
both @entity30 and @entity88 have proven to be reliable sources of internal @entity1 discussions in the past			0
something new to the table ( t ) : previously there has only been two flavours of @entity3 - black and white @entity9 tablets can be found at around the £ 200 mark , including the @entity9 - based @entity100 , held here by @entity103 ceo @entity102 @entity104 hated the thought of a smaller @entity3 , calling them ' dead on arrival '			1
he said people did not wish to use smaller tablets for video - playback , and feared a smaller tablet would serve as a bridge between the @entity3 and the @entity113 , resulting in app - makers simply ' stretching ' their phone apps for the tablet			0
in a 2010 earnings call , he said : ' one naturally thinks that a seven - inch screen would offer 70 percent of the benefits of a ten - inch screen			0
' unfortunately , this is far from the truth			0
… the reason we wo n't make a seven - inch tablet is n’t because we do n’t want to hit a lower price point , it ’s because we think the screen is too small to express the software			2
' @entity104 ' feelings towards seven - inch tablets was reported in his official biography , among other places another big problem - which @entity9 is struggling to deal with - would be the resulting fragmentation , with app - makers having to invest more money for coding different versions of their apps for different devices , something @entity1 has almost entirely succeeded at avoiding so far			2
with the @entity9 tablet market maturing , and competitors like @entity103 launching their own tablets such as the @entity100 at less than $ 200 , it would make sense for @entity1 to join the burgeoning cheaper market , although the company may be concerned about devaluing their premium brand , which is associated with high prices but also high quality			1
however the company has previous form with cheaper models			0
the @entity157 music player was released in 2001 , and in 2004 and 2005 the @entity158 and @entity159 were released , bringing elements of @entity1 's flagship device to a cheaper market			1
in march , a source from within competitor @entity163 made a ' mini ' indescretion while talking to the @entity168			0
while discussing @entity1 and @entity163 's $ 9.7billion deal for @entity163 to manufacturer parts of the @entity3 , an official said : ' the contract is expected to rise to $ 11billion by the end of this year as @entity1 is planning to release a smaller @entity3 , probably with a 7.85 - inch screen , and to sell more of its @entity175 using @entity163 ’s faster solid state drive storage			1

claims suggest @entity1 will launch @entity10 this october for between $ 200 - $ 250
*dramatic* price - point will help @entity1 compete with cheaper @entity9 tablets
@entity1 's $ *100billion* cash reserves may soften blow of loss - making device
