by @entity0 and @entity1 if you tune in to the opening episode of @entity5 ’s @entity4 tonight , you ’ll see a 79 - year - old grandmother of seven dance a stunning salsa with a partner just half her age			1
think that sounds like the formula for a winner ? well , you ’d be right … because the pair have already danced to victory on the @entity17 version of the show			1
the @entity20 programme has been caught up in a fresh fakery row after it emerged that the star contestant of the new series has simply been recycled from abroad			2
but it turns out the pair also wowed tv audiences in 2009 , when they took the £ 9,000 top prize on @entity17 show @entity43 [ you are worth it ]			1
meanwhile , a secret email has revealed @entity5 ’s @entity4 executives scoured the nation ’s top talent agencies looking for seasoned professionals to enter this year ’s contest – despite it being billed as a chance for amateurs to take the spotlight			1
former success : the pair are pictured after dancing to victory on the @entity17 version of the show the email , seen by the @entity62 , billed the series as a ‘ profile raising opportunity ’ , suggesting some will have entered only to boost ticket or album sales			1
many already make a living as singers , lookalike models or tribute acts , meaning their rags to riches tales are unlikely to be quite as genuine as viewers might assume			2
the email said : ‘ i ’m scouting singers for the next series of @entity5 ’s @entity4 for @entity79			1
really looking for fantastic singers with outstanding voices and some personality for this potentially profile raising opportunity			1
‘ looking for outstanding musical theatre singers of all styles , all ages , all shapes and sizes			0
’ it has also emerged that half of the contestants on tonight ’s show come from abroad , leaving critics asking whether the programme has given up on its quest to find the best of @entity5 talent			1
one tv insider told the @entity62 : ‘ this makes a mockery of the talent show format			1
the whole narrative of @entity5 ’s @entity4 is built around the idea that normal people from all over the country get to show off their hidden talents for the first time			2
‘ we watch them being whittled down on tv and imagine we could make it too , if only we entered			0
‘ instead , it looks as if they are hand - picking the cream of the crop in advance			0
and many do n’t even come from this country			0
’ out of 15 acts , tonight ’s episode will feature seven foreign entrants , including a @entity124 violinist , a @entity123 who drums upside down , a @entity126 karaoke singer , a @entity128 dance troupe and a cabaret act from the @entity130			1
@entity131 : judge @entity31 initially appears unimpressed by the pensioner 's routine , and presses his ' no ' buzzer just 20 seconds in			0
but after seeing her acrobatics he apologises , deeming the act ' extraordinary ' surprised : fellow judges @entity139 ( left ) and @entity140 ( right ) also express their astonishment but it is @entity27 – real name @entity144 – and her younger @entity17 dance partner who make the most impact on the judges			1
@entity31 initially appears unimpressed by the pensioner ’s routine , and presses his ‘ no ’ buzzer 20 seconds into the act			0
but after seeing her acrobatics he apologises , conceding she has been ‘ ballistic ’ and ‘ extraordinary ’			0
fellow judges @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity152 also express their astonishment			0
scandal : @entity154 has been caught up in a fresh fakery row after it emerged the star contestant had simply been recycled from abroad			1
above , judges ( l - r ) @entity140 , @entity152 , @entity31 and @entity139 last night , however , show sources admitted mrs @entity160 ’s star performance had not been a complete surprise			0
they revealed she was approached and encouraged to enter after producers spotted her on @entity164 , and on the @entity167 version of @entity165 in 2010			0
the retired dental nurse , originally from @entity169 in the @entity170 , started dancing aged two but took it up again only after her husband @entity172 died in 2003 , 18 months after they retired to @entity17			2
she joined a dance academy run by @entity36 , and the pair have since launched a successful international career			0
a @entity5 ’s @entity4 spokesman stressed that although @entity179 is seen as the @entity17 equivalent of @entity5 ’s @entity4 , it is not officially part of the ‘ @entity4 ’ franchise and is not owned by @entity31 ’s company			2
he added : ‘ anyone can apply for @entity5 ’s @entity4 whether they are professional or amateur , irrespective of their past experience and all contestants are auditioned on merit			0
none of the judging panel had seen or knew of @entity27 before her audition			2

@entity27 , 79 , and her younger dance partner perform on @entity154 tonight
but they have already won £ 9,000 top prize on @entity17 version of show
meanwhile , secret email reveals @entity154 executives scoured talent agencies
