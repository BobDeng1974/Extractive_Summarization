nurses at a scandal - hit @entity2 hospital are being investigated by police for allegedly drugging elderly and difficult patients to enjoy a quiet night shift			1
the issue was raised after @entity8 was told by nurses that patients on his mother 's ward at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity10 were being given powerful sedatives without prescription			1
mr @entity8 was told what was happening by a whistleblowing nurse before the death of his 82 - year - old mother @entity22			1
it has already been admitted in her case during @entity27 investigation into her death			0
mrs @entity22 , a mother - of - five who was left with one leg after an amputation , died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital , which is part of the @entity37 local health board			1
an investigation has been launched at the @entity15 into claims that nurses drugged elderly and vulnerable patients without prescription or consent in order to make sure they had an ' easy night shift ' in the wake of her case , police have referred criminal charges against nurses at the hospital for allegedly giving sedatives to vulnerable patients without prescription or consent			1
mr @entity8 said : ' a nurse told me she had witnessed patients regularly being given unnecessary sedation without prescription at night to make life easier for the night shift team			1
' i told nurses i had been promised by my mother 's doctor she would not be sedated without consent or prescription			1
' they said it is alright for them to promise the impossible and then walk off but we have to cope with them all night			0
' a nurse told us many of the people being sedated are very ill and very frail and if you give them the wrong drug it could kill them			2
' the hospital is already at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect			1
@entity79 , a barrister who represented families at the inquiry into appalling care and high death rates at @entity84 , said that using drugs without the consent of patients so staff could have a quiet night would be inappropriate			2
he said : ' the use of drugs inappropriately , in patients who could not offer consent would also be wrong			2
administering medication to sedate patients so that staff could have a quiet night would be an inappropriate use of that medication			0
' both would be gross breaches of nursing and clinical standards and would likely lead to disciplinary action			0
' as to seriousness , it would evidently have the potential to end the careers of the people involved			0
' the allegations came to light after a nurse told @entity8 his mother @entity22 , 82 , was one of a number of patients being given powerful sedatives without consent or prescription at the hospital mr @entity8 said the nurse said she 'd seen patients on his mother 's ward given drugs without prescription welsh assembly member @entity122 has written to @entity123 , the chief crown prosecutor for the @entity124 in @entity125 , to ask him to speed up the process of reviewing the evidence and to bring charges			1
she said police had been investigating since @entity130 ( @entity37 ) admitted that mrs @entity22 was ' sedated unnecessarily without consent '			2
ms @entity122 , @entity132 for @entity133 , said a whistleblower nurse working for the health board had approached mrs @entity22 ' family and told them that ' for years she has witnessed night staff on @entity139 sedating elderly vulnerable patients without prescription '			1
ms @entity122 said the family had been involved in a ' protracted battle ' to get an answer about what happened to their mother			0
she said : ' so naturally they are at a loss to understand why it has taken 16 months for the police to investigate and why there is not yet a decision from the @entity124 as to whether these admissions of very serious abuses and neglects amount to crimes			2
' they believe - as do i - that 16 months is ample time to investigate and come to a decision			0
bereaved families need closure , and the delays in this investigation are only putting off that day			0
' @entity166 , a lawyer leading calls for a public inquiry into allegations of abuse in the @entity2 , said a decision on charges by the @entity124 would be made in the next few weeks			1
a @entity124 spokesman said : ' @entity174 is investigating complaints regarding the quality of care provided to @entity178 whilst she was an in - patient at both @entity180 in @entity16 and @entity181 during 2010 and 2012 respectively			1
' whilst the @entity124 has been in contact with @entity174 in relation to this aspect of the investigation , we have not been asked to provide formal charging advice			2
in mid-november , the @entity124 received a report from @entity174 seeking observations on their findings and the content of that report is currently under consideration			0
' we have recently received correspondence on this matter from elected @entity196 and representatives of the victim 's family			0
it would be therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further before we have responded directly to these enquiries			0
' a spokesman for the @entity130 said they were cooperating with the ongoing police investigation , but said it would be inappropriate to comment until it was complete			0
