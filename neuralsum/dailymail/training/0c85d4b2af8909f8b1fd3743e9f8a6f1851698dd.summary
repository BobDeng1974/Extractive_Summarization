do you call a long sandwich of cold cuts a sub , a hoagie , or a hero ? a slew of new maps prove how you answer this , and a load of other questions , can betray where in @entity12 you come from			1
the regional differences in @entity12 are apparent to anyone who has traveled even a state or two from their home , but some differences in dialect are n’t as obvious — or as well known — as others			1
but @entity21 doctoral student in statistics took the data compiled from 120 - question survey by @entity27 professor dr. @entity26 that asked @entity12 ’s questions like how they pronounce ‘ lawyer ’ or ‘ crayon ’ or what exactly they call that cold cut sandwich and turned it all into fascinating maps that show just how dialectically divided the country really is			1
how ya 'll doin ' ? @entity39 student @entity38 created over 100 maps using data about regional @entity12 dialect differences			1
how do you describe groups of two or more ? cole - d shoulder : can you just call coleslaw slaw ? again , the north and south are divided			2
and in the south , you put ' slaw ' on your sandwiches ( and even , in some places , on your hot dogs ) sticky issue : caramel has two a 's , but do you pronounce them both ? only if you live in the south and east coast @entity38 was kind enough to share several of these maps with @entity58 , and those interested can peruse a great many others , as @entity38 has also made all 100 + maps available online			1
the most obvious example of where @entity12 regions part ways dialectically is in , to use the survey ’s verbiage , ‘ what word ( s ) they use to address a group of two or more people ? ’ axe to grinder : while most of @entity12 says ' @entity74 ' for a long cold cut sandwich , some say hoagie , hero , or even -- though it 's managed to stay off this map -- grinder how do i pronounce thee ? @entity27 researcher dr. @entity26 , on whose data @entity38 based his maps , found that @entity12 pronounce ' pecan ' in one of four ways , depending on where they come from moving to the @entity89 : @entity90 , and @entity92 reality show fans , may take issue with this , but ' the @entity89 ' apparently also means @entity95 or @entity96 is your name @entity99 ? if so , @entity100 may be a confusing place because in the @entity100 , your name rhymes with ' been			1
' other ways to pronounce it include ' bin ' in most other country and ' bean ' in @entity109 tourist destinations if your answer is ‘ ya ’ll , ’ then chances are very good you were raised south of the @entity113			1
other responses included ‘ you all , ’ used mostly in @entity115 and a chunk of @entity117 , and you guys , which is basically used everywhere else			2
not included in the map is the uniquely @entity122 alternative ‘ yinz guys			0
’ just say @entity124 : nearly following the ' ya 'll line ' is the pajama line			0
@entity128 and a few folks in the northeast call their jammies ' puh - jaaahmas ' while the rest of the country prefers their nightwear to be ' puh - jam - uhs ' or is it parkway ? debate rages about whether that ' big road you drive fast on ' is a freeway or a highway , with westcoasters leading toward freeway is your lawyer loyal ? regardless , if the first syllables of the words sound the same to you , you 're probably not from the south , where lawyer rhymes with callyer @entity153 me merry and we 'll be @entity155 : if you hear this sentence and it makes sense , you 're like most of @entity12			0
but in some regions , people pronounce each word differently a less obvious example is the word ‘ caramel			0
’ though sweet , preference for how to pronounce the sugary treat seems to create a bitter divide according to @entity38 ’s map			2
travelers to @entity169 be warned : the state reported the most who pronounce it ‘ carm - uhl , ’ without the second ‘ a. ’ crayon jewels : ' @entity174 , ' ' cray - awn , ' ' cran , ' or ' crown , ' they all mean crayon fifty fifty : about half the country calls the eggy dressing man - aise , while the others prefer the extra zip in the middle , calling it may - uh - naise circular logic : only in @entity184 are rotaries more than those volunteer retirees with tents at fairs -- they 're traffic circles in most of the country , while @entity190 calls them roundabouts other questions include the perennial favorite ‘ pop ’ or ‘ soda , ’ how to pronounce ‘ pecan , ’ and the question that will annoy every @entity197 who reads the maps , ‘ what do you call the miniature lobster the one finds in lakes and streams ? ’ dying dialect ? only @entity207 and folks from half of @entity100 seem to use the rare colloquialism of ' bubbler ' when referring to drinking fountains			2
or are they water fountains ? what gives soda its pop ? long an indicator of one 's @entity219 roots , a ' sweetened carbonated beverage ' is probably a ' pop ' if you 're from the @entity225 states but a soda if you 're from the coasts what 's stuck in your crawfish : those from @entity231 , where the tiny lobsters are a delicacy , might take issue with the alternatives ' crayfish ' and ' crawdad ' @entity238 ? if the spelling and pronunciation of the rock star 's name have never added up for you , you 're from @entity243 or a town called @entity245 , pronounced @entity238 , outside @entity246 @entity38 ’s interest in creating these maps seems to personal			1
he is , after all , a statistician not a linguist by trade and he ’d love to work with dr. @entity26 on another project sometime			0
‘ i ’ve always found variations in dialect fascinating , ’ he told the @entity21 blog @entity255			1
‘ language says so much about who a person is			0
to me , dialect is a badge of pride – it ’s something that says , “ this is who i am ; this is where i come from			0
” ’ suuuurup : most of the country opts for the pronunciation ' sirup ' but others put ' searup ' on their pancakes ( or are they flapjacks ? ) what if i 'm playing racquetball ? : the term tennis shoes describes rubber - soled athletic shoes to most @entity12			0
but in the northeast , where they 're more often called ' sneakers ' we have no idea : respondents outside eastern @entity285 seemed confused when asked what they call drive - thru liquor stores			0
but residents of the region call them ' brew thrus ' violent weather ? when its raining , but the sun is still shining , a small area in the deep south refers to the phenomenon as ' the devil beating his wife '			0

a @entity21 doctoral student 's fascination with differences in @entity305 dialects led him to create over 100 maps that show the colorful ways in which @entity305 *diverges*
