the revised ' @entity16 ' regulations were introduced after @entity19 detainee @entity17 died in custody with 93 injuries after being kicked and punched by soldiers in @entity23			1

warning graphic content @entity1 soldiers have been banned from shouting at insurgent terror suspects after a series of legal cases			1
this picture was released as part of the inquiry into the death of @entity17 this comes days after it emerged that the @entity40 subjected detainees to controversial torture techniques including waterboarding , ' rectal feeding ' and sleep deprivation			1
despite the global outrage , @entity1 military chiefs still fear the current restrictions on interrogators could hinder the gathering of vital information which could prevent terrorist attacks			1

colonel @entity59 , a retired @entity60 military officer , said the rules on interrogations have been tightened up because of the lawyers since he left the @entity64			2
' the effect of the ambulance - chasing lawyers and the play - it - safe judges is that we have got to the point where we have lost our operational capability to do tactical questioning			0
that in itself brings risks to the lives of the people we deploy , ' he told @entity79			0
the revised ' @entity16 ' regulations were introduced after @entity19 detainee @entity17 ( pictured ) died in custody with 93 injuries after being kicked and punched by soldiers in @entity23 ' these insurgents are not nice people			1
they behead people ; they keep sex slaves			0
they are not normal people			0
' the previous policy - known as ' @entity92 ' – allowed soldiers to show ' psychotic tendencies ' , and aim ' personal abuse ' at a captive who could be ' taunted and goaded '			2
they were permitted to ' shout as loud as possible [ with ] uncontrolled fury ' at a captive			0
the legality of these techniques were brought into question after the death of @entity17 , as the innocent civilian was found to have suffered an ' appalling episode of serious gratuitous violence '			2
an inquiry into his death , published in 2011 , disclosed that he had been subjected to sustained beatings by soldiers from @entity111 the @entity112 in september 2003			2
these stills were taken from a video of a @entity1 soldier screaming abuse at hooded @entity19 detainees the new guidelines have restricted the use to shouting to a couple of seconds at a time – and is only meant to gain a captive 's attention			1
but these were challenged once again after @entity19 national @entity125 sued the @entity126 saying it should ban soldiers from shouting or making ' stern comments ' to detainees			1
although mr @entity125 's detention predated the new policy , his legal team argued the technique which involves ' shouting or screaming in a detainee 's face ' - breaches the @entity135			1
the @entity136 threw out mr @entity125 's challenge - but in doing so disclosed how the technique works and when it can be applied			0
lord justice @entity139 and two fellow @entity136 judges ruled the @entity16 policy lawful as it did not ' involve any violation of the duty of humane treatment '			0
but they found a number of breaches , including an interrogator who ' slammed the desk with his hand ' and one who ' slammed the wall with his hand '			0
colonel @entity59 ( left ) said soldiers have ' lost their capability ' to do tactical questioning , pictured with hosptial administrator @entity157 , in central @entity19 ( right ) defence secretary @entity159 , the defence secretary , has said he is concerned about the rising cost of legal cases and the scrutiny on @entity1 troops			1
' what 's important for us is to understand the legal scrutiny that we are under all the time now , the cases that are being brought sometimes spuriously by law firms representing people who claim they were wrongly detained			0
' our armed forces are under a huge degree of scrutiny			0
' he said he feared this could inhibit commanders in the field in future			0
' a spokesman for the @entity126 said : ' whilst we will investigate and take appropriate action when there are credible claims of serious mistreatment and abuse , we will defend ourselves from claims that we believe are without merit			0
' mr @entity186 , a 26 year - old father - of - two , died after sustaining 93 injuries while in custody in @entity23 , southern @entity19 , in 2003			1
soldiers wrongly believed the @entity19 national was involved in the murder of four of their colleagues			1
he and nine other men were forced to endure beatings , kickings and karate chops in conditions of intense heat and extreme squalour			0

he said he wanted the interrogation method ' @entity16 ' to be outlawed in warzones			0
