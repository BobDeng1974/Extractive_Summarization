the eurozone has fallen into a double dip recession , as the debt crisis even managed to slow @entity4 's powerhouse economy to a virtual standstill			1
the 17 - country bloc - which generates a fifth of global output - shrank by 0.1 per cent between july and september and by 0.2 per cent in the previous three months			1
two falls in a row means a double dip recession			0
and this time , @entity4 and @entity13 , the eurozone 's biggest economies , could not save the region from a double - dip even though both their economies grew by 0.2 per cent			1
the news comes a day after violence erupted in cities across @entity22 as protesters took to the streets in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity13 to demonstrate against tough government austerity measures			1
@entity27 and @entity25 are in the worst state , having been contracting for a year already , while @entity28 is suffering an outright depression			1
the good news is that while the @entity47 predicts a 0.4 per cent contraction for the eurozone in the whole of 2012 , it believes it will grow 0.1 per cent in 2013			2
experts hope that that growth , while small , will increase year on year			0
riot police were forced to protect the @entity26 parliament from angry protesters yesterday , while rubber bullets were fired on the streets of @entity58 , and there were running battles with police in @entity62 and @entity63 , and clashes in @entity65 and @entity66			2
meanwhile , @entity4 's predicament is prompting particular concern among economists , as the eurozone crisis takes an increasingly severe toll on its normally robust economy			2
no respite : @entity4 and @entity13 , led by @entity74 , left , and @entity75 , right , could not save the bloc from a double - dip even though both countries managed 0.2 per cent growth in the recent quarter showing solidarity : protesters in @entity83 , @entity4 , join @entity22 day of action against austerity measures the signs are that after months of resilience , @entity22 's largest economy is seeing its companies unnerved by the crisis and demand for its goods in the eurozone and abroad dry up			1
while @entity4 gross domestic product expanded by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter , it slowed to 0.3 per cent in the second and weakened again to 0.2 per cent in the third			1
economists expect a worse performance in the fourth quarter			0
@entity99 , economist at forecaster @entity100 , said the latest figures confirm that the eurozone is now in modest recession ' in all senses of the word '			0
' in reality , the eurozone was already in recession in most senses of the word as a current record unemployment rate of 11.6 per cent would testify , ' he said			0
' indeed , the third quarter of 2012 marked the third eurozone quarter - on - quarter gdp drop in four quarters ( broken only by flat gdp in the first quarter of 2012 ) and left gdp down by 0.6 per cent year - on - year			2
' @entity25 : a car set on fire by protesters on an industrial estate cuts off access to the city @entity123 in northwestern @entity25 @entity26 : a riot policeman with a dog runs past a fire which has been set by protesters in @entity128 @entity99 added that with the eurozone seemingly headed for further gdp contraction in the fourth quarter , and the underlying inflation situation in the region looking far from alarming , the @entity129 was likely to cut interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.50 per cent sooner rather than later			1
he said an interest rate cut in december was very possible			0
@entity137 , an economist with the @entity138 , said : ' we are now getting into a double dip recession which is entirely self - made			0
' it is a result of excessive austerity in southern countries and unwillingness in the north to do anything else , ' he said			0
@entity58 : police and protesters clash during the general " @entity152 " strike against the government austerity measures @entity25 : a protester is dragged away by police in @entity58 , @entity25 ' countries in the south have to reduce their deficits , but they can not if those in the north with a surplus are not willing to help with stimulus			2
this divide , even hostility , between countries is stronger than i have seen in the last 20 years			0
' the degree of austerity has now put so many people in terrible conditions that they reject all of this			0
that 's a very dangerous situation			0
' @entity170 , economist at @entity172 bank @entity171 , said the 0.1 per cent eurozone contraction was not a surprise after the @entity4 and @entity13 numbers , and it could have been worse			1
' what you notice is that the recession in southern @entity22 is slowly creeping to other countries			2
look at the @entity172 , with a strong contraction , and @entity181 , also with a small contraction			0
there was no contraction in @entity185 and @entity186 but the second quarter was very bad			0
' burning issue : riot police officers face protesters during a demonstration outside the @entity26 @entity191 in @entity128 cornered : riot police officers protect themselves from a projectile at the end of a demonstration organized by @entity25 's ' indignant ' protesters stand off : demonstrators push fences to make a barricade during clashes with riot police after a protest near the @entity25 parliament in @entity58 turned violent across @entity25 : police agents and civil guards clash with protesters trying to prevent buses from leaving the bus depot in @entity209 , @entity25 ' if you look at the indicators for the fourth quarter you see that even @entity4 may not grow again			1
' meanwhile , @entity13 's prime minister assured a @entity4 audience on thursday that his country is committed to getting its debt under control , and said that is essential to preserving @entity13 's sovereignty			1
@entity221 's first visit in @entity4 since taking office in may comes as concerns grow that @entity13 's economy , the eurozone 's second - largest , is weakening just as the government has to slash spending to reduce its deficit			1
@entity13 is @entity83 's most important ally in fighting @entity22 's debt crisis			1
@entity13 is committed to ' stop burdening future generations with continuously rising debt and restore the necessary leeway for political actions , ' @entity221 told a gathering of @entity4 business leaders			1
he stressed that ' we are aware that getting the public finances in order is also the precondition for our sovereignty			0
' according to official figures published thursday , @entity13 narrowly avoided falling into recession in the third quarter			2
its economy expanded 0.2 percent in the july - september period from the previous quarter - as did that of @entity4 , where growth is slowing			1
president @entity74 's @entity250 government has promised to rein in massive government spending and reduce the deficit , largely by raising taxes			0
but the country has watched unemployment tick steadily up as a raft of companies announced layoffs in recent months			2
the jobless rate now stands at 10.8 percent , according to @entity22 statistics .			0

@entity262 shrank by 0.1 per cent in the july - september period and by 0.2 per cent in the previous three months
