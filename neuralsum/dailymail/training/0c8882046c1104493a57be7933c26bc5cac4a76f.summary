lesbian women earn more than straight employees - but gay men are paid less , a study has found			1
on average around the world , homosexual women are paid 12 per cent more than heterosexual counterparts - yet gay men get 9 per cent less than straight males			1
@entity11 ’s pay gap for lesbian women against others is 8 per cent , while gay men get 5 per cent less			1
between the two lies @entity27 , where gay men earn 9 per cent less than straight men and gay women earn 11 per cent more			1
the figures come in a report released yesterday into inequalities in the labour market which looked at gay and lesbian employees worldwide			1
it was carried out by dr @entity37 , an economist at @entity38 in @entity39 , who said : ‘ a puzzling issue is the earnings premiums found for lesbian employees in some countries			1
by country : in the @entity23 , gay men earn 16 per cent less than straight men , while the figure is 5 per cent in @entity11 ‘ gay men often avoid certain male - dominated occupations in favour of female - dominated occupations - less masculine jobs - for which salaries may be lower			1
‘ the higher salaries among lesbians in some countries may reflect discrimination in favour of masculine traits rather than against them			0
‘ in addition , lesbians tend to self - select into male - dominated occupations that may offer higher salaries			0
’ he added : ‘ there are no quantitative studies of the relationships among gender identity , personality characteristics and labour market prospects for lesbians			0
‘ so whether lesbian employees possess characteristics that enhance their attributes for job advancement and earnings is still unknown			0
’ @entity21 , @entity76 , the @entity23 and the @entity77 are said to have the strongest protection of sexual - orientation rights , including workplace anti-discrimination laws			0
differences : the report found gay and lesbian employees have lower job satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts and are more likely to be harassed and bullied by colleagues ( picture posed by models ) but the report claimed that despite this , all gay people are discriminated against in favour of heterosexual applicants with comparable skills and experience during the hiring process			2
that was observed in studies carried out in @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity20 , @entity100 , the @entity23 and @entity76			0
the report also found that gay and lesbian employees have lower job satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts and are more likely to be harassed and bullied by colleagues			2
but gay and lesbian people who are open about their sexual orientation within the workplace are more likely to report higher job satisfaction than those who are not			2
the report highlights that not even 20 per cent of countries have adopted sexual orientation anti-discrimination laws in employment			0
at the same time 2.7billion people live in countries where being gay or lesbian is a crime			2
the study was based on 10 surveys and commissioned by the @entity119 of @entity121 project .			0

on average globally , lesbians are paid 12 ****%**** more than straight workers
