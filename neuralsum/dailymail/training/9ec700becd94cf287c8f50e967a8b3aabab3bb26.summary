by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:43 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 20:43 est , 9 november 2013 when the @entity3 was pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week , it was a marked contrast with her normally immaculate look			0
it was also a clue to the trendy colouring technique that attracted attention at @entity11 ’s christening			2
today , @entity12 has revealed that she has been having a £ 350 colouring treatment known as balayage – a technique that involves ‘ painting ’ the hair with ammonia - free dye to give a natural look			1
@entity21 : @entity22 of @entity23 has adopted a new hassle - free beauty regime of ammonia - free hair dye blonde disciples : @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) are fans of balayage			1
the @entity32 style , which means ' to sweep ' , was made in the 1970s for blonde hair , which reacts more readily to the hand - painted bleach it is popular with celebrities including @entity28 and @entity27			1
but , as last week ’s pictures make clear , balayage colour can fade quickly on brunettes – and @entity28 has already summoned her hairdresser for a touch - up			1
the trend was invented in @entity32 in the 1970s - although it did n't take off in @entity43 until 2008			1
translating as ' to sweep ' , the free - hand strokes of bleach painted onto a woman 's hair is designed to give a style of movement that block colour can not			1
chocolate brown : throughout her life as a student at @entity55 , @entity28 's hair was a block shade of dark brown uniform : the @entity60 's hair was immaculately uniform when she announced her engagement @entity64 : @entity65 ( left ) and @entity66 ( right ) have used it to give their hair shape it was originally only done for blondes , whose hair is more sensitive to the dye and more readily shows the effects			1
but as demand soared , stylists worked to develop different techniques which work for brown hair			2
as pictures of @entity28 captured this week , brunettes are still resilient to bleach as dark hair takes longer to react			1
and balayage , designed for natural hair , is not the ideal way to cover already existing roots			1
@entity28 has been topping up her chocolate brown locks for years			0
impeccably placed sources have whispered that the @entity60 had , to her then horror , started finding the odd stray grey ( ‘ stress highlights ’ , her friends joke ) before her pregnancy			0
when the technique crept onto catwalks five years ago , beauty blogs and fashion magazines lauded it as ' the working woman 's dream '			2
it is low maintenance , deliberately uneven , and lasts longer			0
after three appointments , only a toner and freshener is required , rather than the full treatment			0
compared to normal dye , when balayage grows out there is not a clear line of roots , meaning women can be more flexible with their appointments			0
to combat these , she had organic vegetable - based dye and subtle low - lights applied during regular four - hour visits to the @entity117 in @entity118			2
evidently , @entity28 has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers , even royal ones , can spare four hours at the salon when they 've got a four - month - old to look after			0
' going grey marks nature ’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes , ' says @entity129 ' i always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide , to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly			2
' however , @entity28 may want to avoid any unnecessary chemicals : it could be that she 's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant or breastfeeding			0
many women stop colouring their hair during pregnancy , with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of their baby to begin again			0
this is for fear of the chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through breast - feeding .			0

@entity151 , a @entity32 beauty technique created in 1970s , means ' to sweep '
bleach is painted free - hand in strokes over the hair to give movement
designed for blonde , natural hair , brunettes takes longer to react to the dye
