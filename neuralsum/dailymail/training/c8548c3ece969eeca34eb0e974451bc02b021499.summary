by @entity0 it cost @entity2 $ 2.5 billion to land their curiosity rover on @entity4			0
but , with tongue firmly in cheek , perhaps they could have fooled us all by sending a rover to the abandoned @entity10 mine in @entity11 instead			2
photographer @entity13 ’ incredible photos show how , in a secluded part of the @entity16 , there is a landscape that looks as alien as anything any rover has seen on the red planet			1
no place like home ? the ' @entity4 ' landscape of @entity10 mine near @entity25 , @entity11 is revealed in these beautiful photos by @entity27 mr @entity13 had been unaware of the mine until a local told him to go and check it out			1
what he found absolutely blew him away			0
‘ i was a bit shocked , ’ @entity13 tells @entity31			1
‘ i did n’t expect the colours to be so vivid , and it was pretty alien looking			2
it ’s more like a @entity36 set			0
’ the mine itself was first opened in 1782			2
although it was mostly used to mine copper , there were a number of by - products that are still present today			2
these include black tin , arsenic , pyrite and zinc ore , all of which combine to produce the fantastic colours you can see in the images			1
the mineral waste including copper , black tin , arsenic , pyrite and zinc ore has collected in a lagoon on the site producing vivid colours the site is part of the @entity11 and @entity64 aliens among us : pictured is plant life on the site that gets covered with the mineral deposits producing a range of strange colours @entity4 or rust : the lagoon gets its red colour from copper sulphate left from the old mine ‘ what you ’re seeing in the pictures are the remnants of mining silt that built up in the mines that is held in the lagoon on the site , ’ continued mr @entity13			1
‘ when the water level drops slightly , all the minerals stick to the side of the lagoons which is why you get all these odd colours			1
’ in addition to the lagoon , many plants are also coated in different minerals , with brambles appearing a metallic purple and willow trees a bizarre greenish - yellow			2
the out - of - this - world effects occur all year round when heavy sunshine follows periods of rainfall			0
with summer on its way , @entity13 says it ’ll look even more impressive on the balmiest of days			1
roses are purple , violets are red : the waste minerals at the site have given the plants some rather odd - looking colouration look but do n't touch : a risk assessment of the local area suggests it is safe to explore , but the council advises against eating the soil or drinking the water hotting up : the colours within the site are at their most vivid on hot , sunny days @entity13 explored the site with his friend @entity122 and said the site was simply beautiful safety first : the council is confident that no significant damage is being done to the surrounding environment the site is now used for mountain bike competitions , but strictly no motorbikes are allowed most of the site itself is a public right of way , with some of it used as a mountain bike circuit			1
the local @entity137 purchased the mine in 2002 for £ 1 from previous owners @entity139			1
an @entity142 investigation into the site was carried out to check for possible contamination of the surrounding wildlife			0
initial reports said some areas were a risk due to high levels of arsenic but now , according to @entity152 chairman @entity151 , the site is largely safe to explore			1
@entity10 was once part of a site called the @entity156			2
first opened in 1782 , the area was at times highly profitable			0
the main produce was copper , along with smaller amounts of black tin , arsenic , pyrite and zinc ore			0
by 1870 , however , much of the useful minerals had been mined			0
by the early 1990s the entire site was closed and later opened to the public by the council , who purchased it for £ 1			1
‘ a full investigation by the @entity142 said that there are some places where you would n’t want to eat the soil or drink the water , but that ’s pretty common to @entity179 , ’ he tells @entity31			0
‘ there ’s a slight impact on the local stream but , when taken into context of the whole watershed , it ’s trivial as to what comes out of the tin mines further downstream			0
‘ there ’s no impact at all on the area wider than a couple of hundred yards			0
‘ there are signs up which are there to educate people not just about the history and the environment , but also that they should n’t drink too much of the water			1
’ ‘ the risk analysis by the @entity142 was that there is very little danger to anyone in the valley			0
’ with that in mind , @entity13 points out that the area is a public right of way and anyone can go along to enjoy the beautiful scenery			1
‘ it ’s beautiful in its own right , ’ he concludes			0
‘ i would n’t swim in the lagoon though , no. ’			0

photographer @entity13 has unveiled *stunning* photos of a **disused** mine
the @entity218 mine is part of the @entity220 and @entity221
waste minerals from the **disused** mine near @entity25 create fantastic colours when the water level drops
the mine was closed in the early @entity229 but bought by the local council for £ 1 in 2002
although largely safe , *visitors* are advised to be *cautious* when *interacting* with the hazardous environment
