by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 20:26 est , 15 september 2013 victim : @entity2 was watching tv in her living room when she was nipped by a spider a woman who was bitten by a house spider had to be rushed to hospital and drip - fed antibiotics after the bite festered into pus - filled blister - which then burst			1
@entity2 , 41 , was watching tv in her living room at her home in @entity13 when the spider - which she describes as pale and whitish - scuttled up and nipped her ankle			1
what started off as just a small spot swelled over the course of a few days into a golf - ball sized lump and her ankle became stiff and painful			1
the mother - of - four went to the doctors and got some antibiotics for the bite			1
but she decided to go to hospital after nearly a week had gone by , and blisters began to form around the bite			2
she was kept in hospital for three days as doctors battled against the spider 's venom and the boil burst - twice			1
mrs @entity2 , a secretary , said : ' the doctor said it could have poisoned my blood			1
the whole thing was terrifying			0
' i was struggling to walk and started to panic			0
" the bite had become a huge bump and was leaking horrible yellow stuff			0
' mrs @entity2 said she had never been scared of spiders and simply brushed the animal off her leg			1
' it 's unlucky to kill them , ' she said			0
' i ca n't believe something so little could cause so much damage			0
you expect to hear things like this in @entity51 or @entity52 , but not in @entity53			0
' poison : mrs @entity2 went to hospital after her wound grew from a small bite mark to a huge blister over several days burst : mrs @entity2 still has difficulty walking after the blister ruptured twice while she was in hospital ' it was a pale - whitish colour and had a really small body , but really long legs			1
' a woman at pest control has since told me it could be a genus pholcus spider , but i do n't know what kind it is , i hope i never see it again			2
' i was in so much pain , i just could n't believe such a little thing could have made me feel so ill. ' when i explained the injury the hospital admitted me straight away and put me on antibiotics through a drip			1
' but my bite then turned white and continued to grow and grow			0
' over three weeks later mrs @entity2 is still experiencing pain from the bitten ankle			1
' at the moment it is healing quite well , but it has taken a long time , and it still hurts me , ' she said			0
' i will always have a scar on my ankle			0
' and she admitted the experience has turned her into something of an arachnophobe			0
' i 'm terrified it could happen again , ' she said			2
' my little boy used to love picking up spiders and insects all over the place			2
' @entity97 is only five and i 'm petrified he could get bitten			2
he 's still only little and i dread to think what could happen			0
' now as soon as i get in the house i 'm on spider watch , then before bed it is spider watch again			2
' i have n't had a night 's sleep since it happened			0
' only 12 species of biting spider are known to be found in @entity106			2
the @entity106 's most dangerous spider is believed to be the steatoda nobilis - known as the false black widow spider - which can land grown men in hospital with its bite			1
experts have warned of an increase in the numbers of the false black widow in recent years due to a run of milder winters			0
