by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob as ever it was @entity2 who expressed the mood of the @entity6 public best after the semi-final win against @entity8 , even if it involved an inevitable degree of self - aggrandisement			1
‘ they laughed when my first words as @entity14 coach were : “ give me @entity15 and 10 others ” , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but no one is laughing any more			0
’ and even if almost everything else @entity2 pronounced on as national team coach of @entity14 four years ago was wrong , that much was right			1
even in the country of @entity23 , the man who once upon a time could not even make @entity21 ’s first team is rightly being acknowledged as one of the world ’s finest holding midfielders			1
challenge of the @entity29 : @entity15 denies @entity30 top block : @entity32 has been an influential cog as @entity14 chase a third @entity29 win the sliding tackle to block @entity30 ’s shot , which saved @entity14 against @entity8 , will never be forgotten , not simply because of the skill and tenacity with which it was executed but also because of the excruciating post-match quote from @entity15			1
‘ sorry for being gross but i tore my anus doing that , ’ he said			0
given that he has spent much of the past two years filling in at centre - half at @entity44 , and at times being exposed , many might have forgotten just how good @entity15 was at @entity46 when directing a game from the base of midfield			1
at this tournament there has been a reminder and wednesday ’s performance has brought an outpouring of praise in his homeland , where he has been portrayed as a cross between @entity58 , a latter - day @entity59 — the ‘ @entity61 ’ in his name making it an easy pun — and the 19th century liberator of @entity66 , @entity67			2
for @entity15 , very much a footballer ’s footballer rather than a galactico , it has all become a bit much			1
‘ i ’m not @entity58 nor am @entity73 , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t take anything that is being said seriously			0
i can see the humourous side of it all but i ’m embarrassed			0
and that ’s not false modesty because false modesty is worse than pride			2
a leader of men : @entity15 talks to his team - mates before extra-time in the @entity8 game snarling : @entity15 talks to @entity23 at half - time of the @entity8 game ‘ the hero worship is too much as people begin to have expectations that perhaps you ca n’t meet			1
that ’s what ’s been going on the past few days			2
people think that you can do things that in reality you ca n’t			0
i ’m grateful for the praise of the people but honestly i do n’t really like it			0
’ that said , where once it was assumed @entity23 would lead this team — and in a manner of speaking he does and is still the most influential figure on the pitch — it is both @entity15 and @entity23 who were delivering the team talks before extra-time and penalties in the huddle of @entity14 players			1
it appears there is a symbiotic relationship between the two , one a natural leader by virtue of his intelligence and personal qualities , the other a leader because of his sheer ability			0
‘ we ’re satisfied and calm about the job we ’ve done , ’ said @entity15			2
‘ now we have to make a pact as a team to reach the next level			2
mixed emotions : @entity15 and @entity127 embrace after seeing off @entity8 on penalties glee : @entity14 celebrate @entity131 's winning penalty ‘ i still ca n’t believe we ’re playing the final game at @entity134			1
i ’m really happy to part of this group			0
it was a very intelligent tactical display against @entity8 but it does n’t end there			2
we are about to play the most important game of our lives			0
’ as for @entity2 ’s assessment of the team of @entity15 and 10 others , he is predictably dismissive			1
‘ it ’s neither @entity15 , nor @entity23 , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s all of us together			0
we ’re proud of being a really good group , without egos and all aiming for the same thing			0

@entity15 is rightly being acknowledged as one of the world ’s finest holding midfielders
the sliding tackle to block @entity30 ’s shot , which saved @entity14 against @entity8 , will never be forgotten
both @entity15 and @entity23 delivered the team talks before extra-time and penalties in the huddle of @entity14 players
