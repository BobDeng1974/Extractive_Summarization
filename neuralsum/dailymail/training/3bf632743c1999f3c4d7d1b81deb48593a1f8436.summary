by @entity0 for @entity1 police shot dead an escaped £ 5,000 bull which was retreating peacefully into a shed , the animal 's furious owner has claimed			1
@entity2 sent @entity6 , two marksmen and a firearms commander in an armed two - and - a - half hour operation after @entity10 strayed into a country road			1
farmer @entity12 insisted his bull was being herded calmly back towards a shed when it was shot and slammed the killing as ' outrageous and totally morally wrong '			1
furious : farmer @entity12 ( right ) has made a formal complaint to @entity2 after his prize bull @entity19 ( pictured ) , a @entity20 worth around £ 5,000 , was shot dead by marksmen on monday mr @entity12 , who breeds sheep and cattle and has two butcher 's shops , added : ' it 's as if it was target practice ' the 45 - year - old claimed police were ' hell - bent ' on destroying his prize animal and said : ' it 's almost as if it was target practice			1
' officers were called just after 11am on monday to the village of @entity34 , @entity35 , to reports the bull had escaped			1
@entity6 kept the public at bay while a number of police marksmen , understood to have been at least two accompanied by a commander , tracked the animal as the incident unfolded			2
the bull was then shot dead at 1.30pm - just as mr @entity12 said it had retreated to a field and workers were encouraging it into a shed 40 yards away			1
mr @entity12 , a cattle and sheep breeder who also owns two butcher 's shops , said @entity19 was worth £ 5,000 and has made a formal complaint to police			1
' it was n’t an aggressive bull , ' he said			2
' i fed him every day			0
' my nine - year - old daughter used to feed the bull along with some of our other cattle on a sunday , and i would n't let the girl do that if i had any doubts about his character			2
' i imagine she 'd be very upset if she knew what happened to @entity19 but i 'm not going to tell her			0
it 'll be easier to tell her i sold the bull than have her in tears			2
' upsetting : the incident on monday lasted two and a half hours and ended in the bull being shot dead he added : ' they had no right to shoot him - he was doing no harm and he was not a danger to anyone			1
' the bull got out and ended up in another field			2
the owners of that field put the bull out onto the road and called the police to say there was a dangerous animal on the road			1
' the police marksmen then came and shot the bull , even though it was about half a mile from the road and causing no one any harm			1
' by that stage there were people herding it into a shed and everything would have been alright given a bit of time			0
' the animal was in no way aggressive			2
i 've got plenty of his calves still here and their temperaments are all brilliant - very gentle animals			2
' he knew the sheds and he was n’t going anywhere			0
he weighed around a tonne so he was n’t a fast runner			0
there was absolutely no need to kill him at that point			0
' it ’s a disgrace			0
they never gave us a chance			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' the complaint will be dealt with by the @entity131			1
it would be inappropriate to comment further until this process has been completed			0
' mr @entity12 said it was unlikely his insurers would pay out because @entity19 had been shot by police			1
but he added : ' i ’m not so bothered about that , it ’s not the insurance , it ’s the animal itself			0
' he was a fine healthy bull			1
he was one of two			0
i ’d had him about two - and - a - half years and would probably have kept him for another ten years			1
' @entity2 declined to comment on the specific complaint			2
a spokesman said : ' it will be dealt with by the @entity131			0
it would be inappropriate to comment further until this process has been completed			0
' speaking generally , inspector @entity148 added : ' it 's the last resort for the police and firearms officers to take this action			0
we try everything else but if the public are in danger , that 's our priority			0
