by @entity0 published : 01:57 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 17 april 2013 profits at @entity2 slumped by 51 per cent last year as it wrote off £ 1.2billion on a failed attempt to conquer the @entity5			1
the fall in pretax profits – down by £ 2billion to £ 1.96billion – was its first in 20 years			1
it is to close or sell its @entity10 convenience store chain in the @entity5 in what is an ignominious failure for @entity14 ’s biggest retailer			0
worrying : profits at @entity2 slumped by 51 per cent last year as it wrote off £ 1.2billion on a failed attempt to conquer the @entity5 the supermarket giant is also scrapping more than 100 store developments in the @entity14 as customers switch to shopping online			1
that move saw the value of its vast land bank , much of it bought during the property boom , written down by £ 804million			1
it will now sell many sites that it had earmarked for large hypermarkets for less than it previously believed the land was worth			0
the figures were outlined yesterday by chief executive @entity32 , who is leading a £ 1billion plan to revamp its stores , improve food lines , hire extra staff and improve customer service			2
this is part of a shift to concentrate on building sales through existing @entity14 stores and through its website with home deliveries and its click and collect service			2
@entity2 is also trying to escape its reputation as a faceless giant by buying the family friendly restaurant chain @entity49 , and investments in the coffee shop chain @entity52 and the bakery business @entity53			1
it seems outlets under these banners will be opened in some of its large @entity57 hypermarkets to make a visit more of a day out than a chore			0
the exit from the @entity5 and the decision to scale back store building suggests mr @entity32 is effectively burning much of the legacy of his predecessor , sir @entity64 , who left in march 2011			0
leaving aside the special one - off costs , underlying profits relating to day to day sales still fell by 14.5 per cent to £ 3.55billion , according to the latest annual accounts published yesterday			1
the decision to pull out of the @entity5 is not the only failure on the international front , for @entity2 also revealed problems with trading and expansion in @entity75 , the @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity10 opened its first outlet in @entity79 , @entity80 , on november 1 , 2007			0
it was to be the first of 1,000 convenience stores that would bring @entity14 supermarket shopping to @entity5 consumers			0
just as @entity85 of the @entity5 had bought the @entity87 chain in the @entity14 , so @entity2 would now challenge the @entity5 giant in its own backyard			1
three booming states – @entity80 , @entity91 and @entity92 – were picked for the launch			0
but within two years , they had become among the worst hit by the sub-prime mortgage crisis , which led to the financial crash			2
@entity2 hit : the group confirmed plans to pull its @entity10 business in the @entity5 and reported its first fall in full - year group profits for two decades @entity2 poured £ 1billion into the venture , but it has never turned a profit during more than five years of trading			1
only 199 stores were opened			0
@entity5 were put off by the stark aisles , plastic wrapped fruit and veg , ready meals and self - service check - outs in a country where bagging up groceries for struggling shoppers is a customer service essential			0
at the same time , it was unclear whether the chain was presenting itself as a budget option or a place for aspiring shoppers to buy high quality food and drink			0
in the @entity14 , a growing number of shoppers buy their groceries online or via smartphone , but in the @entity5 very few families shop in this way			0
@entity10 , which employs some 5,000 people , was the brainchild of former chief executive sir @entity64 , who sent his most senior lieutenant , @entity130 , to run it			0
despite mr @entity130 ’s expertise , the venture failed to take off and he quit the @entity5 business last december with a pay - off reported to be £ 5.7million			1
now , @entity2 has appointed a @entity5 firm to try to find a buyer for the whole business or some of the stores			1
@entity5 rival @entity140 ’s is expected to buy all the stores in @entity80 and @entity92			0
@entity143 , director of retail consultants @entity144 , said : ‘ this grim set of numbers shows that even @entity2 is mortal			1
‘ from day one , @entity10 was an unmitigated disaster for @entity2			2
boss : @entity2 's chief executive @entity32 spoke of ' natural consequences of strategic changes ' it is retreating from the @entity5 with its tail firmly between its legs			2
‘ even without the @entity10 debacle the supermarket would probably still have seen its profits fall for the first time in 20 years			1
@entity2 took its eye off the ball in spectacular fashion and , in its goal to be a world - beater , forgot to take care of the basics			1
’ @entity2 said the investment in improving stores and customer service in this country is already bearing fruit			2
but the business was among the big losers from the horse meat scandal after it was forced to remove many contaminated products from sale			0
chief executive mr @entity32 said : ‘ the announcements made today are natural consequences of the strategic changes we began over a year ago and which conclude today			0
‘ @entity2 already looks , feels and acts like a different and better business			2

@entity2 group reports first fall in full - year group profits for two decades
down 52 *%* to £ *2bn* after property *writedowns* and *slowing* sales growth
but it saw best like - for - like sales growth for three years in final quarter
