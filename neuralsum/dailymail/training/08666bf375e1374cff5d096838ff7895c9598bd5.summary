by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 07:41 est , 9 november 2012 concerns : @entity3 , 53 , does not have accessible veins in his arms , hands or legs because he is so obese , a doctor said a 400lb death row killer is ' too fat ' to receive a lethal injection , his doctor said in a court filing			1
@entity3 , who is scheduled to die in january , does not have accessible veins in his arms , hands or legs because he is so obese , the doctor said			1
@entity12 , 53 , now wants a federal judge to stop his execution on the grounds his weight could cause him to suffer severe pain during the procedure			1
it is ' highly unlikely ' that an iv could be placed in @entity12 's legs and ' extremely unlikely ' that veins could be found in his hands , @entity21 medical center anesthesiologist @entity19 said in affidavit filed on thursday			2
@entity12 also has scars on his left and right forearms from a suicide attempt that make his veins inaccessible for an iv , @entity19 added			2
the killer said his depression and scar tissue would also make it difficult for his executioners to administer a lethal injection			2
@entity12 weighs more than 400lbs ( 28.5 stone ) , his doctor said , adding the killer had given blood in the past but had found it extremely difficult			2
providing blood samples was no guarantee an iv could be inserted into @entity12 's vein , the doctor added			2
@entity3 was sentenced to death for shooting dead @entity47 in 1983			1
@entity47 's son , @entity48 , has called @entity12 's arguments ' laughable '			1
fears : @entity12 is worried executioners at the @entity52 will not be able to find a vein because of his weight arguments : @entity57 , who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008 , argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible escaped death : in 1994 @entity64 , who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death , had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation the lethal injection , invented in 1977 , is designed to kill a patient quickly and painlessly			1
the cocktail of drugs used varies from state to state , but generally it contains a barbiturate that induces a deep sleep ; a paralysing agent that halts breathing ; and potassium chloride , which stops the heart			2
however , dosages vary by state , not by inmate ; people are given the same dosage regardless of their size			0
as a result the lethal injection is not necessarily quick or painless , a 2007 study published in @entity87 found			0
if any of the doses in the injection are off the patient feels pain but also may suffer a slow death by asphyxiation , according to the study			1
molecular biologist @entity97 of the @entity98 , told the @entity99 at the time : ' this idea that this is a painless procedure is completely wrong			1
it 's just invisible because the person is paralysed			0
' @entity12 's attorneys also want more time to pursue arguments that claims of a full confession by the inmate to several people have been falsely exaggerated			0
@entity12 has tried losing weight , but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise , according to the court filing			1
@entity12 's request for gastric bypass surgery has been denied , he has been encouraged not to walk because he 's at risk for falling , and severe depression has contributed to his inability to limit how much he eats , his filing said			1
the state currently opposes @entity12 's request			0
before his execution in 2008 , 266lb ( 19 - stone ) death row inmate @entity57 also claimed @entity127 authorities would have trouble finding a vein in his flab			0
in a lawsuit , @entity57 argued that he would suffer a painful death by lethal injection because of his size			0
however , his execution passed without any recorded incident			0
in 1994 in @entity138 , a federal judge upheld the conviction of @entity64 , but agreed with @entity64 's contention that at more than 400 pounds , he was too heavy to hang because of the risk of decapitation			0
@entity64 argued that hanging would constitute cruel and unusual punishment			0
after numerous court rulings and a third trial , @entity64 was eventually sentenced to life in prison , where he died in 2006 .			0

@entity3 worried his weight will mean he suffers severe pain during procedure
shot @entity47 dead in 1983
