by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:33 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 25 march 2013 criminal families are being granted the chance meet up behind bars under controversial rules designed to stop relatives losing touch if they are both jailed , it can be revealed			2
@entity11 mps said it was ' disgusting ' that inmates are transported across the country to be reunited with girlfriends , husbands , fathers and daughters serving time in different prisons			1
figures obtained by @entity1 reveal that despite deep cuts to justice budgets , taxpayer - funded trips are organised once a fortnight to ensure prisoners can ‘ maintain strong family ties ’ while on remand or serving sentences			0
under @entity31 rules , jails have a duty to arrange inter-prison visits for inmates to see relatives also serving time under official rules published by the coalition , jail staff have to make efforts to arrange for inter-prison visits for inmates to meet relatives who are also locked up			1
the trips , which could cost more than £ 100 - a - time , can take place every three months			0
@entity11 mp @entity46 said : ' prison is a place where criminals are sent to be punished for their crimes and stripped of their liberty			1
' it is disgraceful to see bureaucrats allowing quarterly visits between relatives in jail as part of the justice secretary ’s plans to remove prisoner perks i hope he will consider abolishing this entitlement			0
' when members of our @entity65 putting their lives at risk fighting for our country are expected to go months without seeing their loved ones , it will disgust the public to see criminals enjoy this perk			1
' relatives who qualify include husbands and wives , civil partners , children , siblings including half - and – step brothers and sisters , grandparents , anyone an inmate was living with in an ‘ established relationship ’ before being jailed and ‘ those who have clearly demonstrated the intention to register a civil partnership but have not yet done so ’			1
@entity31 records , obtained through freedom of information laws , reveal 28 inter-prison visits were arranged last year , including four male prisoners visiting girlfriends , two men visiting brothers , one man meeting his mother and another meeting his wife			0
' disgusting ' : @entity11 mps @entity46 and @entity100 criticised the arrangements , insisting convicted relatives should not be allowed to meet up in 2009 @entity103 , the ringleader of an animal rights gang which targeted an animal testing laboratory , boasted of being transferred from @entity107 prison to visit his jailed wife @entity108 in @entity109 in @entity110 while they were both on remand			1
in a newsletter to supporters , @entity103 boasted said the £ 110 taxi ride had secured ‘ two hours of heaven ’ together			2
the pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to blackmail and were sentenced to nine years in jail			0
since then the number of inter-prison visits have risen sharply from just 18 in 2010 , including female prisoners visiting daughters , husbands and boyfriends , to 28 last year			0
@entity11 mp @entity100 , a member of the justice select committee , said : ' i ’m glad that the numbers we are seeing are so small as it should never be the norm that convicted relatives are routinely able to meet up			1
' @entity133 should be about punishment and rehabilitation of offenders , and i fail to see how anything but the most exceptional of circumstances can warrant a family get together behind bars			1
' the rules state that the reunions behind bars must be arranged , subject to the availability of transport and accommodation for the inmates are prison guards official guidance which runs until 2015 states that ‘ subject to security requirements and the availability of transport and accommodation ’ , arrangements may be made for inter-prison visits to take place at three - monthly intervals			1
each prisoner must surrender one visiting order and each visit should last ‘ as long as local circumstances permit ’			0
@entity161 , a @entity11 member of the justice select committee , defended the arrangement			2
he said : ' there 's stacks of evidence that says maintaining positive family relationships during a stay in prison helps with resettlement on release so , we should n't bite our nose off by arbitrarily closing down inter-prison visits			1
' @entity174 should , and do , manage each case individually which includes for - instance , a very different regime for high risk offenders			0
' the @entity31 said : ‘ the purpose of inter prison visits is to enable close relatives , where both parties are prisoners at separate establishments , to maintain strong family ties			2
‘ inter-prison visits will be granted by the governor only where security requirements are met and subject to the availability of appropriate transport and accommodation			0
‘ the decision to allow any visit must be balanced against the need to maintain security and keep prisoners in lawful custody			0
‘ visits must be well managed , monitored , and where necessary due to inappropriate behaviour , terminated to maintain the good order and discipline of the prison			2

prison staff are *obliged* to organise reunions behind bars for inmates to see spouses , civil partners , parents , grandparents or children
@entity11 mps condemn ' disgusting ' perk , insisting criminals must be punished
supporters argue maintaining contact will help rehabilitation after release
