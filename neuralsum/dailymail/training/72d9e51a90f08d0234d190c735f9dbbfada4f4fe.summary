by @entity0 published : 09:44 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 16:13 est , 9 march 2013 for many travelers , taking pictures is simply part of the experience , but for one frequent flier , his trip almost did n't happen after taking a photo on board his plane			1
@entity11 , 26 , who has racked up nearly a million air miles , was settling into his business class seat from @entity14 to @entity15			1
excited after being upgraded , mr @entity11 decided to blog about the experience and started clicking away with his iphone			1
little did he know he had broken one of @entity20 's rules			0
welcome aboard : but do n't take any pictures please ! a business class blogger was asked to leave his flight after taking a photo from his seat before takeoff after taking a picture of the empty seat in front of him , a fight attendant ran over and told him he could n't take a picture and was escorted from the plane			1
writing about the experience in his travel blog , mr @entity11 says he was told the taking of pictures violates @entity20 's policy			1
the policy appears in the in - flight magazine : the use of still and video cameras , film or digital , including any cellular or other devices that have this capability , is permitted only for recording personal events			2
photography or audio or video recording of other customers without their express prior consent is strictly prohibited			0
also , unauthorized photography or audio or video recording of airline personnel , aircraft equipment or procedures is always prohibited			2
any photography ( video or still ) or voice or audio recording or transmission while on any @entity20 aircraft is strictly prohibited , except to the extent specifically permitted by @entity20			0
determined not to be forced from his flight to @entity67 mr @entity11 begged the flight attendant to let him stay : ' look , i am a traveler			1
i am not a terrorist , i write about airline stuff all the time			2
here is one of my business cards , ' he told her			0
a few moments later he was dragged from the plane by one of the gate agents passing the captain on the way			0
' the captain was quite rude , and he says , essentially , ‘ i do n’t want to hear you , get off the plane before i call the police			0
’ upgraded then offloaded : @entity11 , 26 , joked to a flight attendant that he was a blogger and not a terrorist			1
it did n't go down well with the captain who threatened to call police unless he left the plane ' there were whispers throughout the business class and @entity97 cabins as i made the walk of shame down the aisle , ' @entity11 wrote on his blog			1
he called the incident ' traumatizing and highly embarrassing			0
' agents at @entity105 rebooked him onto another flight that left 45 minutes later but it was n't until he had written about the experience on his blog that management from @entity20 reached out to him			2
they offered him what he describes as some modest compensation for the disruption to his travel plans			0
no explanation : @entity20 rebooked mr @entity11 on another flight but have not explained their reasons for removing him from his flight			1
they say customers can take pictures on board so long as it respects the security and privacy of other customers @entity20 have not commented on why mr @entity11 was removed from the aircraft but instead have told mr @entity11 that an ' extensive internal investigation ' is underway			2
they have also provided a statement about their policy : we welcome customers to record their personal experiences on board provided they do n’t take photos or videos of customers and crew members without their consent			0
this is both a security and service measure we take that also respects the privacy of other customers			0
mr @entity11 has admitted it was n't his smartest moment to use the word ' terrorist ' on the plane , but he says he does n't want anyone else to experience inconvenience and embarrassment that he has had to endure .			1

blogger @entity11 has almost a million air miles but it was n't enough to keep him on his a flight to @entity67
upgraded to business class he started snapping away violating airline policy
he joked that he was ' not a terrorist ' but the comment got him kicked off the plane
