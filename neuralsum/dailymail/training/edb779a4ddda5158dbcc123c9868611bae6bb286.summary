by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 20 november 2013 an ancient pocket of seawater has been discovered deep underground in @entity3 , @entity4 , and provides hints at what the world 's oceans were like during the time of the dinoaurs			1
the sample is thought to be 100 to 150 million years old and suggests that the @entity12 was once twice as salty as it is now			1
the water contains chloride and bromide as well as other chemicals which helped the scientists age it to the @entity19			2
the water is thought to date back 150 million years , when the @entity21 roamed @entity22 ( @entity23 of dinosaur , pictured ) the @entity25 refers to the state of the @entity27 142 million to 65 million years ago			1
it ended with the greatest mass extinction in history - the entire planet 's dinosaurs died out			2
it is thought that a giant asteroid impact caused the mass extinction			2
prior to this , the @entity27 was warm with no ice caps at the poles			0
much of what we now know as dry land - such as southern @entity41 and the midwest of the @entity43 was underwater , since sea levels reached their highest ever during this time			0
the @entity12 grew much wider as @entity45 drew apart from @entity46 and @entity47			0
the @entity48 was formed at this time , and the island that was @entity50 began its journey north towards @entity52			0
while older water has been discovered in @entity54 , the @entity3 water that sits more than half a mile underground is now thought to be the oldest large body of water known on the planet			1
' previous evidence for temperature and salinity levels of geologic - era oceans around the globe have been estimated indirectly from various types of evidence in deep sediment cores , ' said @entity68 , a @entity69 research hydrologist and lead author of the investigation			2
' in contrast , our study identifies ancient seawater that remains in place in its geologic setting , enabling us to provide a direct estimate of its age and salinity			0
' scientists have described the finding as ' like a fly trapped in amber ' , which was trapped by the aid of a massive comet or meteorite impact that struck the area about 35 million years ago , creating @entity3			1
the largest crater discovered in the @entity43 , the @entity3 impact crater is one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide			1
the largest crater discovered in the @entity43 , the @entity3 impact crater is one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide			1
scientists have described the finding as ' like a fly trapped in amber '			0
it is thought to have been trapped by the aid of impact of a massive meteorite ( @entity23 pictured ) about 35 million years ago a huge rock or chunk of ice traveling through space blasted a 56 - mile - wide hole in the shallow ocean floor near what is now the mouth of the @entity3			1
the force of the impact ejected enormous amounts of debris into the atmosphere and spawned a train of gigantic tsunamis that probably reached as far as the @entity119 , more than 110 miles away			0
the impact of the comet or meteorite would have deformed and broken up the existing arrangement of aquifers - water bearing rocks - and confining units - layers of rock that restrict the flow of groundwater			2
@entity4 's ' inland saltwater wedge ' is a well - known phenomenon that is thought to be related to the impact crater			1
the outer rim of the crater appears to coincide with the boundary separating salty and fresh groundwater			0
' we knew from previous observations that there is deep groundwater in quite a few areas in the @entity142 around the @entity3 that have salinities higher than seawater , ' said @entity145 , acting @entity69 associate director for @entity147			1
' @entity149 theories related to the crater impact have been developed to explain the origin of this high salinity			0
but , up to this point , no one thought that this was @entity12 water that had essentially been in place for about 100 million years			1
' ' this study gives us confidence that we are working directly with seawater that dates far back in @entity27 ’s history , ' @entity158 continued			0
' the study also has heightened our understanding of the geologic context of the @entity3 as it relates to improving our understanding of hydrology in the region			1
' groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of @entity54 may predate the emergence of multicellular life , but it certainly does n't taste great , a leading scientist claimed earlier this year			0
a joint @entity175 and @entity54 team discovered the ancient pockets of water , which they say are like ' trapped time capsules ' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years			1
@entity180 , an @entity27 sciences professor at the @entity181 , who was studying the water , described it as tasting ' terrible ' after feeling compelled to take a sip			2
the water , that is still being studied , could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight			1
more exciting still , the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on @entity199 raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the @entity199			1
in an interview with the @entity205 , she said that what jumps out at you first is the saltiness			0
she said : ' because of the reactions between the water and the rock , it is extremely salty			2
' it is more viscous than tap water			0
it has the consistency of a very light maple syrup			0
it does n't have colour when it comes out , but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy colour because the minerals in it begin to form — especially the iron			0
' she added that ' you would definitely not want to drink this stuff ' .			0

water was discovered deep underground in @entity3 , in @entity4
while older water has been discovered , this water is now thought to be the oldest large body of water known on the planet
