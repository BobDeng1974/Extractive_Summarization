nowadays , we ’re all glad to be grey			2
or so we ’re told			2
apparently it ’s never been so fashionable to be wrinkly			2
look at the novelist @entity2 in the new ultra-cool photo shoot for high - end @entity5 fashion brand @entity6 , wearing a tight black pullover , giant sunglasses and what looks like a brass cowbell around her neck			1
or the latest campaign from @entity14			1
no skinny scantily - clad 20 - somethings here , but instead three old women in widow ’s black — very chic , naturally — clasping @entity14 ’s latest must - have handbags			1
i ’m guessing they ’re all well past their 70th birthday			2
novelist @entity2 , 80 , ( pictured ) stars in this season 's @entity6 campaign , @entity2 is just one example of older models being used in high fashion advertising then there ’s singer @entity29 , 71 , all over the new @entity31 advertisements , lost in music as she plucks at her guitar			1
and @entity36 , the 86 - year - old @entity38 model and another @entity14 veteran , whose career seemingly goes from strength to strength			1
meanwhile , finger - on - the - pulse fashion store @entity42 has this year scrapped its annual @entity44 showcase — in which it introduces the work of trend - setting young designers — and instead launched @entity47 , a platform for stylish 50 to 80 - somethings and a celebration , so the shop says , of the ‘ retirement renaissance ’			1
old ladies , it seems , are having a moment			1
as though the style - gurus have suddenly decreed that being young is a bit , well , passé			1
the @entity59 ( pictured ) also stars three stylish older women but why , i wonder ? have the fashionistas at last woken up to the beauty of the ageing female face ? are we , the over- 70s , the new @entity66 ? well , forgive me for being cynical			1
but i do n’t think so			2
deep down the fashion industry does n’t for a moment believe that older women can be style icons , and never has			1
this is not about grey power , but about the power to shock			1
for the way in which these older women are photographed by the fashion industry — all sagging skin and lifeless hair and stark lighting with its deep , dark shadows — does them no favours			1
the images are striking and headline - grabbing , but they are not designed to lure my generation into the shops			1
i am 74 and have spent more than 50 years in and around the fashion industry — and believe me , there has never been a time when youth was not worshipped as the most desirable quality in a woman			2
every woman , whatever her age , was always assumed to want it			2
why on earth would you aspire to look old ? @entity29 , pictured in 2013 , is all over the new @entity31 campaign for 2015 and they do look very old , these women			1
only @entity2 could carry off the austere look she ’s been given , make - up free and with her grey hair combed flat			1
i admire her intellect enormously , but i do n’t want to look like her in the @entity6 advert , and it does n’t make me want to buy the sunglasses			1
but these advertisements are not directed at me and my generation			1
they are far too exclusive for that , with their sheen of urban sophistication and layers of irony			2
look at us , they say : are n’t we radical ? putting wrinkly old ladies in young women ’s clothes			1
these ads are still designed to sell frocks to the young			1
at best they are a bit of fun ; at worst , they poke fun			0
at a pinch they might be art. but truly they are not busting any myths about the fashion industry			0
oddly enough i find the @entity131 campaigns much more ground - breaking			0
in the @entity131 advertisements , older women feature alongside younger ones , and all of them look stylish , elegant and chic			1
older women want to be fashionable — but they also want to be taken seriously , and to be offered clothes in which they will look their best			1
all of this seems very familiar to me			0
i made my name as a model during the ‘ youthquake ’ , when the elegant grown - up fashions of the @entity143 were forgotten in the rush to celebrate all things young			2
neat suits and white gloves gave way to mini-dresses and hot pants			0
these were not looks anyone over 25 could successfully attempt			0
no wonder models were on the whole judged past their sell - by - date at 30			2
i once appeared in a fashion campaign at the geriatric age of 47			0
when @entity159 ’s prs rang to ask if i would appear in a group shoot , i assumed they ’d made a mistake and felt obliged to warn them i was ‘ no spring chicken ’			0
to my huge surprise , they still wanted me , and in the end i did a shoot on my own			0
yet my appearance in the campaign — wearing well - cut jodhpurs and plain shirt — was still considered daring , @entity169 took the time to comment on the ‘ originality ’ of my inclusion			0
like the older women in the current ads , i was a faddish anomaly			1
but by making news in the right magazine , i served my purpose			0
@entity183 ( pictured ) is 74 and was featured in a @entity159 campaign at 47			1
she says her appearance in the campaign was considered daring even then , whereas now the designers are picking far older women the real proof that fashion has n’t fundamentally changed is on the shop floor			2
old age may have been designated ‘ chic ’ this season , but it remains very difficult to find smart , stylish clothes that are suitable for a woman of my age			2
and why do designers still think all 70 - year - olds — except those in daft adverts — should be wearing beige ? it ’s a killer of a colour that makes almost everybody look washed out			0
there is , however , one sector of the business that has started to get it right			0
@entity211 , 47 , ( pictured ) is the new face of @entity214 cosmetics			0
@entity183 says that the make - up industry is are the real champions of the fashionable pensioner at 47 , actress @entity211 has been hired as new face of @entity214 cosmetics			1
indeed , the real champions of the fashionable pensioner are the make - up companies			0
at last they have begun to appreciate who their real customers are , and how much disposable cash they have			0
a third of the @entity38 population is aged over 50 , while most major household spending decisions are taken by women aged between 40 and 60			0
more women over the age of 50 are working than ever before			0
twenty years ago , the radiant @entity229 was famously dropped by make - up company @entity230 for being ‘ too old ’ days after her 40th birthday			0
@entity183 saus she found @entity131 's 2011 adverts featuring veteran models like @entity234 ( centre ) alongside younger models far more groundbreaking than those solely showing older women but that ridiculous ageism is long gone in the cosmetics industry			1
look at the @entity243 advertisements starring @entity244 , 69			0
who would n’t want to look like her — whatever their age ? or for that matter , like @entity249 , 68 , who smouldered in last year ’s campaign for @entity252 cosmetics ? these women are allowed to look beautiful rather than bizarre			0
and as they know so well , real style is ageless			0
there are n’t many good things about growing old , but one is that you start to care much less what other people think about you			0
which is a good thing in my book			0
otherwise we ’d all be posing in sunglasses and polo necks and impractical dresses which would look much better on our daughters			0
or our grand - daughters , come to that .			0

@entity2 for @entity6 , @entity29 for @entity31 and @entity272 , a @entity14 veteran , are all examples of older models of the moment
but is this really a *nod* to the older generation or is it just a shock *tactic* ?
@entity183 says these ads are not directed at her and her generation but just a new way of selling clothes to the young
