by @entity0 published : 03:31 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 2 january 2013 tragic : @entity1 has died in hospital			1
his family had been battling against a hospital trust 's attempt to withdraw treatment , saying he still ' enjoyed life ' a grandfather has died just ten days after his family lost a legal battle that allowed his hospital to withhold treatment if his condition deteriorated			1
@entity1 , 68 , walked into his local hospital last may with suspected constipation but never left after developing hospital acquired pneumonia and blood poisoning			1
within weeks he was in intensive care and was left unable to speak or breathe unaided			0
last summer the hospital trust - which can not be named for legal reasons - launched a rare legal action seeking permission to withdraw potentially life - saving treatment from mr @entity1			1
his appalled family insisted mr @entity1 , a professional musician , still enjoyed life and was not ready to die leading to a judge rejected the hospital trust 's application but the trust won an appeal against the decision days before @entity33 meaning treatment could be withheld from mr @entity1 if his condition deteriorated			1
his daughter @entity34 , 48 , described the ruling as ' legalised murder '			1
little more than a week later mr @entity1 ' condition deteriorated and he died in the early hours of @entity38 with his family saying they begged staff to do more to help			1
@entity34 said : ' when the nurse told us he was going i just got hold of him and held him tight			2
i told him we would keep on fighting for him			0
' we are all in total shock			0
it 's very hard to take in and my mum is distraught			0
' @entity48 has bounced back so many times that it 's hard to accept that it 's not going to happen now			0
' even now i feel i should be getting ready to go to hospital to see him			2
it is hard to believe that this happened to a man who came into hospital for constipation a few months ago			2
' mr @entity1 's condition deteriorated over the weekend and by sunday his blood pressure was very low and his kidneys had started to fail			1
he was given medicine to tackle the low blood pressure but @entity34 says their calls for him to be given kidney dialysis were rejected			2
@entity34 says the hospital told her dialysis would be ' futile ' and would have subjected her father to ' unnecessary distress '			1
family fight : @entity1 's wife may with daughter @entity73 refused to give up hope and fought for their husband and father not to be put on the care pathway before visiting hospital : @entity1 pictured at home in @entity81 this year before he contracted pneumonia in hospital eventually mr @entity1 went into cardiac arrest on the morning of @entity38 and in accordance with the legal judgement hospital staff did not give cpr			1
when mr @entity1 's heart failed last august staff did give cpr and he made a good recovery			1
mr @entity1 died with his wife of 50 years may , 76 , @entity34 and son @entity92 , 37 , at his bedside			1
@entity34 added : ' this is a direct consequence of the court judgement ten days ago			2
i think they have effectively been slowly withdrawing treatment ever since			0
' as far as the family are concerned my dad has been a victim of neglect from day one - and ever since the court reversed his decision he was effectively sentenced to death			0
' we are just all devastated that it happened so quickly			0
' legal battle : may , right , @entity34 arriving at the @entity108 in @entity109 month ahead of the ruling which saw @entity1 put on the care pathway the case of mr @entity1 further illustrates the furore surrounding the @entity114 ( @entity114 )			1
some relatives argue the controversial palliative care system is a way for medical staff to kill off the terminally ill and old			0
the courts accepted a claim by the hospital that they were not invoking @entity114 in mr @entity1 's case but his family are adamant in their belief he was secretly placed in the @entity114			1
@entity34 added : ' after the latest court hearing doctors told us they would negotiate with us when it came to on - going treatment			2
' we did n't like that word - this is a human life we are talking about , not buying a new car			0
' we knew it was futile too , because ultimately no - one can tell a doctor what to do and what not to do			0
' happier times : @entity1 and may @entity136 on their wedding day in @entity114 in 1962 mr @entity1 had played guitar on the 1974 hit who do you think you are by @entity142 and had also played alongside the likes of @entity144 and the @entity145			1
he was diagnosed with bowel cancer 11 years ago and given just six months to live but made a full recovery after chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery			0
he enjoyed good health until last may when he was admitted to his local hospital with suspected constipation			1
the hospital wanted to give him a ct scan which , as it was a @entity156 , could not take place for a few days			2
when his wife returned the following day she was told he had got hospital acquired pneumonia			1
his condition worsened as he also developed a water infection and septicaemia before being admitted to intensive care three weeks later			0
he then spent the rest of his life on a ventilator and suffered a stroke and cardiac arrest while his court case was still underway			0
but his family have refuted the hospital 's claims that he suffered ' multiple organ failure ' several times			2
@entity92 said : ' he fought and fought until the very end			0
and we will keep fighting to get justice for him			0
' it is understood all treatment given to mr @entity1 was in line with the court ruling , which concluded that @entity183 was not in mr @entity1 ' best interests if his condition deteriorated			1
a hospital spokesman said : ' we 've had close communication with mr @entity1 ' family throughout this process and if there are any issues they would like to discuss further we 'd welcome that			2
