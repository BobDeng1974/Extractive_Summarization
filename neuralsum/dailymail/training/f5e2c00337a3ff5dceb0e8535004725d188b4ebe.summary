@entity0 are close to signing @entity2 midfielder @entity1 for a fee approaching £ 6million			1
@entity4 is determined to strengthen his squad and the purchase of the @entity7 international would be the club ’s first significant outlay of the summer			1
borrowed : @entity1 was on loan at @entity11 for most of the 2013 - 14 season from @entity2 @entity1 , 25 , returned from the @entity13 in @entity14 as one of his country ’s better performers but has one year left on his contract in @entity19			1
