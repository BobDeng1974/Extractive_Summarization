said research house prices will be 13 per cent higher over next 20 years than if migration were at zero @entity4 prices will rise by more than 10 per cent unless mass immigration is controlled , @entity2 warned yesterday			1
the increases in the years to come would go beyond other pressures on the housing market – dealing a blow to young @entity10 already struggling to get on the property ladder			2
in a speech in @entity14 , the home secretary delivered a blunt analysis of the impact of @entity18 ’s ‘ open door ’ immigration policy			1
home secretary @entity2 announced plans for a simplified visa applications for overseas students she said the influx had driven down wages for the working classes and placed huge pressure on schools and social cohesion			1
mrs may cited house prices as an example of how demand created by migrants was having an impact on the wider public			2
her officials pointed to research by professor @entity37 which predicted that , if net immigration runs at 190,000 a year , house prices will end up 13 per cent higher over the next two decades than they would if migration were at zero			1
currently , net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the @entity10 and those leaving – is 183,000 , though mrs may has vowed to reduce it to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			2
busy : the need for housing is growing she said : ‘ more than one third of all new housing demand in @entity10 is caused by immigration			1
‘ and there is evidence that without the demand caused by mass immigration , house prices could be 10 per cent lower over a 20 year period			1
’ mrs may delivered her speech to the @entity63 think - tank only 24 hours after publication of the 2011 census			0
the survey showed how , under ten years of @entity18 , nearly four million immigrants joined the population of @entity69 and @entity70			0
in total , 7.5million people who were born abroad were living here last year – and more than half of these have arrived since 2001			0
in a blistering attack on the @entity18 years , mrs may criticised the last government for failing to measure the impact of immigration on public services and housing , and for assuming it had no impact on the jobs and wages of the settled population			0
she warned that mass immigration undermines social cohesion by making it ‘ impossible ’ to establish the relationships , family ties and social bonds that create a community			0
mrs may said the @entity92 , which is a panel of government advisers , had found ‘ a clear association between @entity96 immigration and employment in the @entity10 ’ – with 160,000 @entity10 workers ‘ displaced ’ between 1995 and 2010			2
some 23 @entity10 workers were kept out of employment for every additional 100 immigrants employed , she said , adding : ‘ for those on lower wages , more immigration means more workers competing for a limited number of low - skilled jobs			1
‘ the result is lower wages – and the people who lose out are working - class families , as well as ethnic minority communities and recent immigrants themselves			0
’ in future , government impact assessments will no longer assume that migrants make a positive contribution to the economy by paying taxes and spending their wages			0
the burden they place on public services will also be considered , she said			0
mrs may also denounced the student visa policy inherited from @entity18 as a ‘ mess ’ which was ‘ abused on an industrial scale ’			0
last night sir @entity127 , chairman of @entity128 , said : ‘ at last we have a home secretary who is honest about the consequences of mass immigration and ready to take on the bogus arguments for it			1

home secretary : ‘ more than one third of all new housing demand caused by immigration '
said research house prices will be 13 per cent higher over next 20 years than if migration were at zero
fewer than one in every 150 last - ditch immigration appeals is *successful* , ministers will *reveal* today as they launch plans to combat ‘ *spurious* ’ court actions . critics say the appeals are often a ploy to let illegal immigrants and failed *asylum* *seekers* *prolong* their time in @entity10 .
