be it ' planking , ' @entity6 ' or ' owling , ' the arbitrary , bizarre internet meme is here to stay - and the latest means of entertainment for the web 's geekiest contributors is about as weird as they come : ' @entity13			2
' ' @entity13 ' - like ' @entity15 ' and ' planking ' before it - does n't require much skill			0
in fact , it requites no skill at all - all you need is a rubber unicorn mask , a camera and a friend willing to snap a photo of you wearing your mask in any random , public , inappropriate place			1
' @entity13 ' was started last fall by a @entity29 - based film producer who began collecting unicorn masks and handing them out to friends for pictures			1
unicorning : the latest trend in @entity35 geekdom @entity13 : the meme was started by a @entity29 producer who gave the masks to her friends for photos making of a @entity41 : the fad gained steam earlier this month when a porn star was kicked out of a baseball game for ' unicorning ' creator of a meme : @entity49 is responsible for the latest viral internet meme : @entity51 ' i put it on when a pizza delivery guy was at the door and his expression was priceless , ' @entity49 , who inadvertently started the meme 's craze , told the @entity60			1
' it 's such a goofy creepy thing			0
especially if you wear one to @entity63 to get free samples			1
' @entity49 posted hundreds of photos of people posing in unicorn masks on her website , @entity70 , before the idea was picked up by the general public and the meme went viral			1
one of ' unicorning 's ' biggest fans is adult film star @entity76 , who is a friend of @entity49 's and knows first hand that ' unicorning does n't always go according to plan			1
out of date : @entity51 has replaced planking as an internet trend the @entity13 strikes with the @entity83 awkward : the most successful ' unicorning ' occurs at the most arbitrary locations - like the grocery store recruitment : all you need to join the @entity13 is a unicorn mask and a friend with a camera earlier this month , @entity91 was ejected from a @entity93 baseball game for ' unicorning ' in the stands and blocking an aisle			1
according to reports , she was wearing a unicorn mask and dancing in the aisle with the hopes of getting on the stadium 's jumbotron			1
it did n't work - a security guard asked her to take her seat , but she did n't and was ultimately thrown out			2
@entity91 says she did n't hear the security guard ask her to take her seat			0
later , a @entity109 police officer got in a bit of trouble after he was photographed with @entity91 wearing her unicorn mask			2
acting pittsburgh police chief @entity114 said in a statement after the incident : ' we are aware of the photos on the @entity35 ( @entity119 ) and are currently investigating the incident			0
' uni-trouble : a @entity109 police officer landed himself in hot water when he was photographed ' unicorning ' with porn star @entity76 the future of memes : what 's next ? ' pigging ? ' ' monkeying ? ' ' @entity127 ? ' internet idiocy knows no bounds a proud soldier in the @entity13 bends down for a drink - in a public fountain the investigation is understood to be probing whether the unidentified officer 's behaviour was appropriate under the circumstances			1
according to authorities , it remains ongoing			0
' i feel stupid , ' @entity91 told @entity60 after the incident			0
i usually only act ridiculous when i get paid			0
' embarrassed or not , @entity91 sees a future in ' unicorning			2
' ' i think it 's the new ' planking , ' she said			0
' and i think it 's safer			0
i heard someone died while planking			0
@entity51 is not as dangerous -- just to a police officer 's career			1

@entity51 got its start when a @entity29 film producer started giving her friends unicorn masks to wear in photographs
a porn star was recently thrown out of a baseball game for unicorning
