mr @entity1 , a former nuclear engineer who now works as a national safety adviser for the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , told the @entity33 : ‘ it is really worrying that there are about 50 cases where they have sufficient concerns to examine cases further			1
‘ i am pleased with the way the inquiry is operating			2
they are interviewing the right people and it seems to be a very thorough process with no stone left unturned			0
’ the inquiry was also set up to address concerns that health regulators at the @entity32 covered up their failure to act on concerns about maternity care at the @entity52 of @entity53			2
each case involves the deaths of mothers in or after labour , still births or the deaths of newborns which are now being examined			1
the inquiry is due to resume interviews next week following a break during the summer			2
it is being led by dr @entity65 , a former deputy chief medical officer , part of the @entity68 and @entity69 inquiries			0

@entity3 died at @entity5 in 2008 following an infection			1
after his death his parents called for an investigation , prompting health secretary @entity25 to order an inquiry in september last year an internal review by the trust uncovered concerns about the maternity unit in march 2010			1
it highlighted poor training of midwives , and a ' dysfunctional ' relationship between staff			0
however , @entity32 inspectors failed to read the report and later that year visited the hospital , ruling it was ' safe '			2
in october 2011 leaked figures revealed the trust had the highest mortality rate in the @entity103 , with 600 ' excess deaths ' in the previous four years			0
three grieving families contacted the @entity106 in 2011 fearing that more lives would be lost unless the hospital was investigated			0
the deaths of @entity114 , 35 , her son @entity109 , @entity111 and @entity112 all occurred within three months at the hospital			1
in december the @entity116 published her findings which concluded there was a series of major failings by midwives may have contributed to the deaths			0
in the case of baby @entity112 , who died in november 2008 when he was nine days old , the report highlighted he would have had a 90 per cent chance of survival had he been given antibiotics			1
in october 2011 , leaked figures revealed @entity128 , which operates the @entity5 , pictured , had the highest mortality rate in the @entity103 , with 600 ' excess deaths ' in the previous four years midwives assumed his temperature was low because the room was cold - when he was actually suffering a serious chest infection			1
he was left in the hands of a junior maternity assistant whose other tasks included serving up patients ’ food			0
the report also found that @entity114 and baby @entity109 died in july 2008 after midwives failed to carry out crucial checks despite knowing the birth would be high risk			2
mrs @entity114 was diabetic and midwives should have checked the baby ’s heart every five minutes but they did n’t even do this every 15 minutes as would happen in a normal labour			0
and it found that @entity111 was stillborn in september 2008 after midwives failed to intervene quickly when his mother got into difficulties and did not monitor the baby ’s heart			0
