it may be difficult to believe , but according to research published next month a world without war may be getting nearer			1
futurologists from the @entity5 in @entity6 and the @entity7 have predicted that global conflict will halve in the next 40 years			1
their study claims the combination of higher education , lower infant mortality , smaller youth cohorts , and lower population growth are a few of the reasons why the world can expect a more peaceful future			1
world at war : soldiers who support @entity22 's breakaway military leaders known as @entity23 at a position held by @entity26 soldiers conflict zone : @entity28 burn a @entity30 flag near the @entity32 office in @entity33 earlier this month			1
the on - going tension in the region will die down by 2050 , research suggests professor @entity37 predicts conflict will be on the wane by 2050			1
here 's how the war map will change that will mean in the next five years the current conflicts in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity26 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 will probably be over , the research suggests			1
as the risk of war decreases worldwide , by 2017 it will be greatest in @entity53 , @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
and by 2050 , as the number of countries at war falls from one in six to one in 12 , the risk of conflict will be greatest in @entity53 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity54 and @entity65			1
the conclusions were made by @entity67 , a professor in the university 's department of political science , who has devised a statistical model in collaboration with @entity74 's @entity7			0
the model , it is claimed , is capable of telling us what is likely to happen in the future			2
' the number of conflicts is falling , ' said professor @entity37			1
' we expect this fall to continue			2
we predict a steady fall in the number of conflicts in the next 40 years			1
@entity86 : research by professor @entity37 suggests conflict will halve by 2050 ' conflicts that involve a high degree of violence , such as @entity46 , are becoming increasingly rare			1
' we put a lot of work into developing statistical methods that enable us , with a reasonable degree of certainty , to predict conflicts in the future			2
' a conflict is defined as a conflict between governments and political organisations that use violence and in which at least 25 people die			2
this means that the model does not cover either tribal wars or solo terrorists like @entity110			0
' in the 1700s it was normal to go to war to expand your country 's territory			2
this strategy has passed its sell by date			0
but , demands for democracy may be suppressed with violence and result in more violence in the short term			0
' his research has found there has been a decrease in armed conflicts and the number of people killed since @entity132 and this trend will continue			1
' @entity132 has become less acceptable , just like duelling , torture and the death penalty			0
' infant mortality , calculated by the @entity32 up to 2050 , is one of the key factors in professor @entity37 's model			1
' countries with a high infant mortality rate have a high probability of conflict			1
infant mortality is now decreasing everywhere			1
' the @entity32 has also estimated population structure up to 2050			2
the population is expected to grow , but at a slower pace than today , and the proportion of young people will decrease in most countries , with the exception of countries in @entity155			2
the @entity156 in @entity157 has extrapolated the level of education up to 2050			0
the simulation model is also based on the last 40 years ' history of conflicts , of all countries and their neighbours in the world , oil resources and ethnicity			1
the conflict data were collated by the @entity169 ' economic changes in society have resulted in both education and human capital becoming important			2
a complex economy makes political violence less attractive			0
@entity177 soldiers patrol the mountainous @entity49 - @entity179 border region where conflict has raged @entity63 is one of the countries where the risk of war will be greatest in 2050			1
here @entity63 soldiers march towards protestors during a demonstration against spiraling fuel prices in @entity189 earlier this year risk of war : an armed man waves his rifle as buildings and cars are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the @entity30 consulate compound in @entity200 , @entity44 , last month ' it has become too expensive to kill people			1
modern society is dependent on economic development			0
it is too expensive to use violence to destroy this network			0
it has also become harder to take financial capital by force			0
' it is easy to move capital across national borders			0
therefore , a cynical leader will be less likely to choose violence as a strategy			0
' it is hard to discern the most important reason why the future will be more peaceful , but some studies suggest that education is the crucial factor			1
' education may be a fundamental causal explanation , but this is difficult to show with our methods			0
demographers believe that more education leads to fewer children			0
there are fewer mouths to feed			0
' another explanation is the @entity32 's peacekeeping operations			0
the world has become better at employing means of preventing states using violence			0
' the @entity32 operations in @entity239 and @entity240 failed			0
but the @entity32 's operations have been more successful since 2000			0
of course , the @entity32 can not prevent conflicts , but fewer die and the intensity is lower when they intervene			2
' drawing to an end ? anti-government fighters celebrate the fall of @entity248 in @entity46 in october last year tension continues : an unidentified @entity30 soldier stands in front of the blast - shattered @entity253 building in @entity255 , @entity256 prof @entity37 used data from 1970 to 2000 to check whether or not the conflict model works as intended			1
he wanted to see if the model could predict the actual conflicts between 2001 and 2009 ' for 2009 we estimated that the likelihood of a conflict was more than 50 per cent in 20 countries			1
16 of these countries ended up in a real conflict			2
we missed by four countries			0
' the simulation programme , which for statistical reasons must be run 18,000 times , was programmed by @entity271 , a research fellow at @entity272			2
but changes had to be made as the on - going instability in the @entity275 impacted the model			0
' prior to the @entity278 spring , we expected 5 per cent of the countries in the world to be involved in a conflict in 2050			1
this percentage has now risen to 7 per cent			0
' the conflicts in the @entity275 weaken the clear correlation between socio - economic development and the absence of civil war			2
the conflicts in @entity46 and @entity44 show that we also have to include democratisation processes in the model			1
' to achieve this , we are now working on projecting democratic systems of government and regime changes , ' explains prof @entity37			0
the study is due to be published in the periodical @entity297 next month .			0

@entity5 research suggests number of countries at war will fall from one in six to one in 12
higher education , lower infant mortality and lower population growth are reasons why the world can expect a more peaceful future
current conflicts in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity26 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 will probably be over
the risk of conflict will be greatest in @entity53 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity54 and @entity65
