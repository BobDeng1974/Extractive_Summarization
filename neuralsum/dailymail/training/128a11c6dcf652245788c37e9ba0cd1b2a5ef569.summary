staff at the @entity2 clinic where @entity3 suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure failed to weigh her before sedating her with @entity7 - the anesthetic that killed @entity9 - a damning new report reveals			1
her daughter @entity12 is ' outraged ' by the revelations by the @entity2 @entity14 , her lawyers have said			1
on monday , the department reported that the legendary comic was in excellent health before undergoing what was supposed to be a routine endoscopy at @entity20			0
while the doctors who treated @entity23 are not mentioned by name , they are believed to be her personal throat specialist dr @entity26 and @entity28 medical director dr @entity27			1
indeed , dr @entity26 is said to have declared ' i 'll go first ' as she stepped into the operating room with dr @entity27 , the report says			1
it also confirms a picture was taken of the star while she was under anesthesia , alongside dr @entity26 and most worryingly , both dr @entity26 and dr @entity27 failed to notice that @entity23 's vital signs were going down , as the report claims they failed to provide ' timely intervention '			1
@entity30 now plans to ' direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient ' , her lawyers told today			0
in a scathing report , it was determined that @entity28 failed to do the following : according to the findings , @entity23 , 81 , arrived at @entity28 on the morning of august 28 for tests after suffering chronic reflux			1
she was in good health and her blood pressure was a normal 118 over 80 when her vital signs were first taken at 8.44am			0
her pulse was 62 and regular			0
@entity23 's doctors : dr @entity26 ( left ) is @entity23 's private throat specialist , while dr @entity27 was the medical director at @entity20			1
both are believed to have been treating @entity3 when she went into cardiac arrest during a routine endoscopy on august 28 the star was set to undergo an @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , where doctors insert a thin scope and camera into the area between the throat and upper intestine			1
however , even though @entity23 had only agreed to only the one procedure , the report states she underwent a @entity86 performed by her personal @entity88 doctor @entity26 - who was not authorized to practice at the clinic			1
this was stopped when dr @entity91 said she did not have a clear view			0
the @entity77 then went ahead , carried out by @entity93 , and dr @entity26 performed a second @entity86			1
worryingly , a staff member told the @entity97 investigators that @entity23 was not weighed before @entity7 was administered			1
this is ' critical ' according to the report			0
the records note an ' inconsistent ' log of the @entity7 dosage			0
although it says she was given a total of 300 milligrams , the clinic 's anestiologist said this was a mistake and only 120 milligrams was administered			0
@entity7 hit the headlines after the death of superstar @entity9 in 2009 , when it was revealed he had overdosed on the powerful sedative			0
bffs : distraught @entity12 posted a picture of her son @entity115 and her mother @entity23 , writing : ' @entity117 , 2004			2
mom + @entity115 = bffs ... a perfect day			0
@entity119 ' still working : dr @entity26 is still working at her @entity39 office			1
she charges $ 460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance			0
she is believed to have been in the room at @entity20 when @entity3 went into cardiac arrest on august 28 perhaps the most damning criticism of the clinic comes as the report says ' the physicians in charge of @entity23 failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention during the procedure '			1
indeed , by 9.30am , @entity23 's blood pressure had plunged to 85 over 49 and no pulse was recorded			2
the report , released after interviews with @entity28 staff and others , says there is conflicting information as to the time that @entity23 was resuscitated and transferred to @entity142			1
last month , it was revealed that @entity23 's daughter @entity30 has signed up a @entity39 legal powerhouse and will launch a multimillion - dollar law suit against the endoscopy clinic where the comedienne fell into a coma			1
@entity12 , 46 , will file a multimillion - dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against @entity28 and is working with top firm @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 & @entity158			2
in a statement , attorneys @entity157 and @entity158 said : ' our client , @entity30 , is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the @entity168 report			2
' as any of us would be , ms. @entity30 is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before , during and after the procedure			2
moving forward , ms. @entity30 will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient			0
' @entity177 ’ official cause of death is “ anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation			0
” the firm needs to obtain @entity23 's medical records before filing a case in @entity186 and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge			2
famous clientele : dr @entity26 , who is believed to have been in the room when @entity3 underwent her ill - fated procedure , counts @entity193 as one of her patients			1
in the singer 's 2010 documentary , dr @entity26 performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords today , dr @entity26 's lawyer , @entity202 , declined to comment			1
dr @entity26 is known as the throat specialist to the stars and counts @entity193 and @entity205 as well as a host of @entity208 stars among her patients			2
previously , mr @entity202 told @entity209 : ' @entity211 , @entity210 is a highly experienced , board certified otolaryngologist			0
she maintains privileges at one of the city 's most prestigious hospitals			0
she is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients			0
' as a matter of personal and professional policy , dr. @entity26 does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment			2
further , dr. @entity26 is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient			0
' for these reasons , neither dr. @entity26 nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice			0
