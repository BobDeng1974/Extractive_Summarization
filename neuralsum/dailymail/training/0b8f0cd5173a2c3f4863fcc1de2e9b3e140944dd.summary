in the last 170 years the number of people working in agriculture and manufacturing has slumped , while millions more now work in offices , shops and more people now work for the state in government , schools and the @entity20 than actually making things in factories			1
change : since millions went to work in factories in the 1930s ( left ) economic and social changes mean far fewer people make things and instead spend their day sitting at a desk growth in banking , out - of - town shopping centres and demand for flexible working have led to a boom in the so - called service industries , with manufacturing jobs outsourced overseas to take advantage of cheaper labour			1
a study by the @entity39 revealed the number of people working in farming and manufacturing has fallen below one in 100 for the first time			1
in 1841 the figure was more than one in five			2

industry : in the last 170 years the number of people working in manufacturing and farming has collapsed , while there has been a huge boom in the service industries @entity58 was as important as the service industry to the economy until the mid- 1960s			1
but large - scale factory closures and outsourcing meant that by the @entity63 80 per cent of people worked in the services , compared to just 8.9 per cent working in manufacturing			1
statistician @entity67 told @entity1 : ‘ we are less reliant on making things within the country , partly through increased globalisation			0
we do now rely on imported manufacturing			0
‘ we have moved towards desk work from manufacturing			2
the service sector tends to be lower average hour , it is more flexible working			0
‘ it used to be the @entity79 where all the shops were , now we have all these big shopping centres			0
’ desk jockeys : social and economic change means millions more people now work in offices census : data taken in the @entity63 every 10 years shows how the jobs we work in have dramatically changes service industries include distribution , hotels , restaurants , transport , banking , government , education and health			1

mr @entity67 said : ‘ in every @entity63 since 1841 the number of people working in agriculture has fallen			2
‘ we have got tractors and ploughs and inventions which mean it is less labour intensive ‘ but also over the last 100 years we built the railways , and we took the railways to the rest of the world , so now we can import food			0
‘ we rely a lot more now on food from the rest of the world than we ever have			0
’ gender : women are more likely to work in service industries while nine out of 10 people in construction are men regions : the data showed wide variation in different parts of the country , with rural areas more reliant on farming the study revealed a wide regional variation in the industries which dominate different parts of the country			1
around eight per cent of people in @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 in @entity148 and @entity149 in @entity151 work in agriculture , compared to the national average of 0.9 per cent			2
