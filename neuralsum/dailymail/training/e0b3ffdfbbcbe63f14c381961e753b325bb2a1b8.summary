@entity0 : 04:56 est , 22 december 2013 @entity1 : 08:50 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 has savaged @entity3 for demanding tougher controls on immigration , accusing the prime minister of behaving like @entity7			1
in an extraordinary attack , the @entity9 business secretary claimed the @entity11 were speading ‘ panic ’ about immigration and compared their ‘ populist policies ’ to mr @entity7 ’s notorious ‘ @entity17 ’ speech from the 1960s			1
and in a bizarre attack on the public , he suggested voters were ‘ schizophrenic ’ because they wanted curbs on migration despite enjoying holidays abroad			1
' panics ' : @entity2 , pictured yesterday , attacked @entity26 demands for greater immigration controls new laws : a ban on @entity31 migrants claiming out - of - work benefits from the moment they arrive in the @entity34 is being rushed through @entity35 ahead of the january 1 lifting of access restrictions on @entity38 and @entity39 nationals mr @entity2 ’s comments threatened to reignite a major @entity42 row over immigration ahead of an expected influx of migrants from @entity38 and @entity39 when controls are lifted on january 1			1
one @entity26 cabinet minister said the business secretary was once again ‘ spewing bile ’ and suggested mr @entity2 should resign if he ‘ hates us so much ’			1
the controversy erupted as a major new report warned that @entity38 and @entity39 migrants could put huge pressure on housing , schools and hospitals in @entity34			0
the study by the centre - left @entity59 says the @entity34 could see an increase in ‘ anti-social behaviour ’ such as ‘ aggressive begging , rough sleeping and even criminality ’ as a result of the new arrivals			0
and it warns that the prime minister ’s much heralded changes to benefits rules will make little or no difference			0
deputy prime minister @entity72 yesterday said it was right to ban new arrivals from claiming benefits for three months when they come to the @entity34			0
political : mr @entity2 made the comments during an appearance on @entity80 's @entity79 show but the @entity9 leader made clear his party would not sanction any further curbs on migrants , saying : ‘ this is where we draw the line			1
’ mr @entity2 went far further , rounding on his @entity42 colleagues with a venom that took senior @entity11 aback			1
accusing the conservatives of inflaming public fear of foreigners , he told @entity80 ’s @entity93 that they were behaving like mr @entity7 , who was sacked from the @entity26 frontbench in 1968 after warning that new arrivals would lead to social unrest			1
the business secretary said @entity26 home secretary @entity99 ’s desire to cap @entity31 migrants at 75,000 a year was ‘ illegal and impossible to implement ’ and claimed @entity26 interventions are doing ‘ a great deal of damage ’ to @entity34			1
dividing line : @entity72 , pictured left , has pledged to block attempts to cap the number of @entity31 migrants allowed into the @entity34 just days after @entity3 , pictured right , vowed to veto any expansion of @entity31 borders he said : ‘ what ’s happening here is that the @entity26 are in a bit of panic because of @entity114			2
' reacting the way they are , it ’s not going to help them politically but it ’s doing a great deal of damage			0
‘ we periodically get these immigration panics , i remember going back to @entity7 and ‘ ‘ rivers of blood ’ ’ and all that , and if you go back a century there were panics over @entity130 immigrants			2
‘ the responsibility of politicians in this situation when people are getting anxious is to try to reassure them and give them facts and not panic and resort to populist measures that do harm			1
’ mr @entity2 also attacked the @entity11 over ‘ very severe ’ public spending cuts , warning that the ‘ social fabric ’ of @entity34 is at risk			1
' we periodically get these panics on immigration , going back to @entity7 and rivers of blood ' @entity2 yesterday finally , he launched a bizarre attack on the public , saying their desire to block new arrivals contrasts with their own wish to travel abroad			1
he said : ‘ it was summarised for me in a debate i had on the doorstep recently			0
somebody said they are so absolutely fed up with all of these immigrants coming into @entity34 , they ’re going to go away and live in @entity159			0
‘ there ’s a lot of sort of schizophrenia about it			0
what we ’ve got to stop is damaging policies that actually do harm			2
’ in the @entity169 , mr @entity72 said immigration was ‘ the biggest dividing line in politics today ’ and plans for a cap were ‘ arbitrary , pointless and distracting ’			2
he wrote : ‘ sticking a big no - entry sign on the cliffs of @entity177 may be politically popular , but at a huge economic cost			0
what would happen if tonight every @entity181 living in the @entity34 boarded a ship or plane and went home ? ' are we really that keen to see the back of @entity187 lawyers , @entity189 accountants or @entity191 engineers ? do we want the @entity192 to fall over and the @entity193 to grind to a halt ? ’ sources close to mr @entity3 sought to downplay the row , insisting it is right to ‘ put in place more robust transitional controls ’ on new arrivals and ‘ to make sure people can come here to work but not just to claim benefits			0
’ referring to mr @entity2 ’s @entity7 comments , the source added : ‘ @entity2 is a member of the government and supports government policy			2
the words he chooses to do that are up to him			2
’ but the @entity26 cabinet minister told the @entity213 : ‘ once again @entity2 opens his mouth and spews bile			0
if he hates us so much , i do n’t know why he does n’t resign			0
we could then have a business secretary who has a clue how to help business			1
’ seventy @entity26 @entity220 are threatening to rebel over a vote on whether transitional restrictions should be reintroduced in january			0
mr @entity3 has resisted calls to face down the @entity31 and extend the controls , despite opinion polls showing public support for such a move			2
@entity26 minister @entity229 claimed fears that @entity34 will be inundated after restrictions on @entity38 and @entity39 migration are lifted on january 1 are exaggerated .			0
