by @entity0 a gp is being investigated amid claims he failed to diagnose a two - year - old with leukaemia and dismissed her symptoms as ‘ toddler bruising ’			1
@entity8 , 31 , took her daughter , @entity9 , to the doctor when worrying bruises began appearing on her body			1
she claims dr @entity13 did n’t even get out of his chair during the brief 30 second check - up at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
@entity19 was diagnosed with leukaemia after developing bruising			2
but , when her mother first took her to the @entity1 , she was sent away and told she had ' toddler bruising ' she is pictured before her illness she said he glanced over his desk , said it was ‘ toddler bruising ’ and there was nothing he could do and then sent them home			1
two days later , @entity9 ’s condition worsened and mrs @entity8 and her husband @entity34 , 30 , took their daughter back to see another gp at the surgery			1
this time , dr @entity38 immediately referred @entity9 to @entity39 where she was diagnosed with leukaemia			1
in the seven months since , @entity9 has had numerous blood transfusions and painful bone marrow tests and been forced to take chemotherapy tablets at home			1
but the family have finally had some good news after being told the treatment is working			2
it means @entity9 has just one month left of taking medication before she is slowly weaned off the chemotherapy			1
@entity9 's mother , @entity52 , says dr @entity13 just spent 30 seconds with her and that he did not check her over @entity54 @entity53 is investigating dr @entity13 who has voluntarily left the practice pending their report			1
mrs @entity8 , of @entity17 , @entity18 , said the gp should be permanently struck off			1
the mother - of - three said : ‘ i took @entity9 to see him and he did n’t even get out of his chair			2
he just peered over the table and said “ it ’s just toddler bruising ”			1
‘ i just thought “ i ’m not a doctor , i do n’t know ” so i left and made another appointment for blood tests in two weeks ’ time			2
‘ the second doctor examined her four times and immediately admitted her to hospital			2
he knew what was wrong but did n’t want to say			2
after months of chemotherapy , @entity9 is now responding well to treatment and will soon be weaned off medication ‘ when we found out it was awful			1
you just do n’t expect any of your children to come down with leukaemia			2
’ she added : ‘ it has been horrible but she has been happy the whole way through and i ’m so proud of her			0
‘ there is always a chance that it can come back which is extremely scary			0
i do n’t think i could go through it again			0
‘ now we want dr @entity13 struck off			1
we want to protect other families			0
you have to do your job properly and he did n’t			0
’ mrs @entity8 says she spoke about her concerns to a pharmacist before seeing dr @entity13 in august last year and they told her @entity9 should have a blood test			1
dr @entity13 is also being investigated by the @entity95 over separate allegations			1
he has been placed under a series of restrictions since november last year after concerns over his medical notes			0
he is one of four doctors who saw a 20 - year - old before she died from heart failure			0
@entity105 ’ family have refused to accept an inquest ruling that she died from @entity107 and say her symptoms should have been picked up sooner			0
a @entity95 spokeswoman said : ‘ i can confirm that the @entity95 is investigating			0
‘ dr @entity13 has restrictions on his practice while the investigation is on - going			1
they were imposed on october 17			0
’ in a statement released by the @entity114 , dr @entity13 , of @entity115 , @entity18 , said : ‘ while matters are being investigated , i voluntarily agreed not to attend the practice			1
‘ i can not comment while there is an investigation taking place			0
’ @entity121 , director of commissioning for @entity18 , said he could n’t comment on individual cases			0
fatigue and pale skin - this is because leukaemia can cause anaemia which makes a child feel weak , tired and light - headed			0
infections and fever - children with leukaemia lack normal white blood cells which would normally help fight infection			0
easy bruising or bleeding - this includes frequent nosebleeds , bleeding gums and bleeding a lot from small cuts			2
bone or joint pain - this is caused by a build up of leukaemia cells near the surface of the bone or inside the joint			0
swelling of the abdomen - leukaemia cells may collect in the liver and spleen causing them to enlarge			0
loss of appetite and weight loss - if the spleen and liver swell , they can press against the stomach causing loss of appetite			0
swollen lymph nodes - some leukaemias spread to the lymph nodes causing them to swell			0

@entity8 took daughter @entity9 to the gp with *unexplained* bruising
she says dr @entity13 said it was ' toddler bruising ' and sent her home
also says he did *n't* check @entity9 over and only spent 30 seconds with her
two days later , her condition worsened and she saw a different gp
she was immediately referred to hospital where she was diagnosed
after chemotherapy she is now responding well
