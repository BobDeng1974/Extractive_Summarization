@entity0 has been playing as a single , lone striker since he was 17 - years - old , when he broke into the first team at @entity3			1
he captained that team and has always played as the lone man up - front , taking relentless kick after kick			2
his devastating pace was used to get in behind defences with very few managers wanting or expecting good link - up play around the half - way line			2
finished : @entity0 will never rediscover the strengths that made him the player he was deadly : in his pomp @entity0 used devastating pace and movement to beat defenders he was always on the shoulder of the centre backs			1
@entity21 wrote in his book that @entity0 needed to have a break as he had been playing non-stop , through the summers in @entity25 , the @entity26 , or the @entity27			1
he had not had a break and played virtually continuously for eight years			0
no rest : @entity0 played almost continuously for eight years and injuries have taken their toll his strength was in his explosive speed , similar to a @entity35 car			1
but being constantly on full throttle that sharp edge has blunted and he has slowed down			0
injuries , kicks and fatigue would no doubt have set in and it is now impossible for him to rediscover what he had			1
it 's time to let him go			2
out of touch : @entity0 has just four @entity46 goals this season and none since january when @entity48 picked a team for the @entity51 quarter - final with no centre forward , even though he had two on the bench in @entity55 and @entity0 , he was sending a message loud and clear to mr @entity57 , who hovers above him , that a top quality centre forward is needed			1
his gamble on @entity60 has paid off to a certain extent , but he is not as quick as he once was and he 's nearly my age			2
message : @entity65 manager @entity48 was sending a message to @entity57 when he did n't start a striker in the @entity51 against @entity68 investment : @entity48 wants the @entity65 owner to invest in a new top class striker in the summer @entity48 's case for reinforcements was strengthened when @entity68 brought on the @entity76 fuel - injected winger @entity74 and the devastating @entity77 who both waltzed @entity78 - like through the @entity65 defence with ease			1
@entity65 's reinforcement at that late stage was 35 - year - old @entity83 , one of the best ever attacking midfield players who was forced on to play a holding midfield role			1
impact : @entity68 were able to bring on @entity77 from their substitutes bench @entity55 also looks a shadow of the striker i remember when he first moved over to @entity92 from @entity93 in 2011			2
i recall standing on the touchline at @entity97 's @entity96 training ground next to @entity98 watching a training session and one player was catching my eye			1
a shadow : @entity55 does not look the same player as the one who arrived in @entity92 in 2011 @entity98 , who is that chap with the bright green size 15 boots on ? ' i asked			0
' is he a trialist ? ' ' no @entity109 , no , ' he replied			0
' this player is @entity55			0
i have just signed him from @entity111			0
' i nodded and smiled , and i looked at @entity113 's 10 - to - 2 gait and bright green massive feet			1
he looked like a duck waddling around			0
i thought what an earth has @entity98 done ? the next day he banged in two against @entity119 ! impact : @entity55 was a huge hit at @entity97 and @entity122 but has failed to fire at @entity65 in 19 years as a manager in the @entity124 i 've never heard or had anyone mention rigging matches or spot fixing			1
never even had a sniff of it			0
i 'm sure for all the players who have been arrested it is a very difficult and testing time			0
until proven guilty : @entity135 captain @entity134 is one of seven players to be arrested for spot - fixing but we must remember they are all innocent until proven guilty			1
let them carry on playing and let them continue their lives until it 's proven that they have done wrong or not			1
of course it is a concern , but hopefully the investigations that are going on will nip it in the bud , so there are no longer any doubts about the integrity of the game			0
difficult : the players should be allowed to carry on playing and continue their lives until guilt is proven talking of integrity , what a mockery it has been made of after @entity158 's fine for fielding an ineligible player was brushed under the carpet and kept secret			1
it is simply not enough for them to be handed a hefty fine and a slap on the wrist for playing @entity168 in four @entity46 matches			0
mockery : @entity158 were only fined after playing unregistered @entity168 even though he is n't the best of players he is still a good one and why can @entity174 and @entity175 get docked points in @entity177 back in 2011 and @entity158 escape ? that is @entity180			1
there will be hell to play if they avoid relegation by only a few points			2
not only that , when he should n't have played in the @entity188 they knocked out my old club @entity190			0
i can not understand why somebody is not responsible for spotting that error at the @entity194 for one moment if they went through instead of @entity158			2
mad : @entity174 and @entity175 were docked points for a similar offence in 2011 they would 've gone on to play @entity200 in the next round which would 've given them a good chance to progress			1
and , who knows , they could 've then got a tie against a @entity46 club , potentially worth millions of pounds			0
when the team sheets were sent in for the league cup surely someone must hold their hands up and take responsibility for the error that has been made.and i say ' error ' as it is not cheating			0
just to make it clear , i do n't feel @entity158 have cheated , but potentially a lower league club could 've been cheated out of a lot of money due to the error			2
missing out : @entity190 may have missed out financially because @entity168 played against them on tuesday night last week i faced the dilemma of choosing between @entity222 versus @entity223 or @entity224 against @entity225			1
one was getting out into the thick of it			0
the other was putting my feet up on the sofa and sticking the telly on			0
there was only one choice for me			0
choice : going to see @entity222 and @entity223 was more appealing than staying in to watch @entity224 and @entity225 i love the big @entity51 games and watching the top players , but the sausage and chips in the board room at @entity222 before the game and the welcome from the ladies who dish out the tickets and serve the tea and the coffee is different class			1
they 're proud of the role they play and their love for @entity250 through the ups and downs is quite moving			0
the banter from the supporters in what must be the oldest shed - like stand in the country was hilarious			0
getting stuck in : the atmosphere at @entity124 and non-league grounds is second to none the one - liners , the stick the ' line - o ' got , and the laughs i had throughout the game made my trip to the @entity268 memorable			2
i enjoy the @entity269 and the @entity51 , but i love getting stuck in at @entity124 and non-league matches .			2

it 's impossible for @entity0 to rediscover what he once had - @entity65 should get *rid* of him
@entity48 was sending a message to @entity57 by not picking a striker in @entity278
those *accused* of spot - fixing are innocent until proven guilty
@entity158 not being docked points made a mockery of *football*
and why i *decided* to watch to choose sausage and chips at @entity222 over watching @entity224 and @entity225 in the @entity51
