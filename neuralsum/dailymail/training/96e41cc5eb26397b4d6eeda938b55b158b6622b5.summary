by @entity0 today @entity2 manager @entity1 announced his @entity4 squad			1
but how did it compare to popular opinion ? one company has picked the starting 11 according to the views of fans on @entity10			1
by counting the number popular tweets versus negative a players gets , telecommunications firm @entity11 has put together their own @entity2 team			1
is this how fans wanted @entity2 to line up against @entity17 in their first game of the @entity19 @entity4 ? it is according to company @entity11 , who compiled a starting @entity22 based on each player 's popularity on @entity10 ( denoted by number here ) before @entity1 's squad announcement today the company uses something known as @entity30 , which they say is a ‘ next - generation listening platform			1
@entity33 ( no ) 2			2
@entity34 ( no ) 3			0
@entity35 ( yes ) 4			0
@entity36 ( yes ) 5			0
@entity37 ( yes ) 6			0
@entity38 ( yes ) 7			0
@entity39 ( no ) 8			0
@entity40 ( yes ) 9			0
@entity41 ( yes ) 10			0
@entity42 ( no ) 11			0
@entity43 ( yes ) it is used to monitor messages on social media			0
in this case it has been used to keep an eye on @entity10 ahead of the @entity52 announcement			2
' @entity30 collected tweets that mentioned @entity2 players and @entity1 , ' the company said in an email			1
' for the players , it was trained to recognise the syntax relating to wanting a player in the team as positive and out of the team as negative			0
' ' to build the @entity2 xi we used the volume of positive mentions to reveal the top two rated strikers , the top four rated midfielders , the top four rated defenders and the top keeper			0
' looking through the @entity10 - picked squad , there are a few surprises			2
in goal , as has been throughout @entity2 ’s qualifying campaign and thus expected to start , is @entity76 's @entity43			2
at the back , while @entity77 ’s @entity41 and @entity78 ’s @entity40 were picked by @entity1 , @entity39 has long been ruled out of @entity2 contention			1
@entity42 , meanwhile , today announced his international retirement after being informed by @entity1 he would not be in the squad , although clearly the @entity10 users were keen for him to go to @entity19			1
it 's not surprising to see @entity36 ( middle ) ease his way into the @entity10 popularity list , but the omission of @entity90 's @entity89 ( left ) and @entity77 's @entity91 ( right ) is a surprise , although the data was taken a month ago before their late season surges in form in midfield the @entity10 users have picked @entity77 and @entity2 captain @entity35 , but their pick of @entity98 midfielder @entity34 was wide of the mark as he is not in the squad			1
@entity38 , however , was a popular choice as @entity10 users back the youngster to make an impact at the @entity4			1
perhaps surprisingly is @entity33 ’s pick as the number one most popular @entity10 player , having been the subject of a fan - led petition to make sure he is not picked for @entity2 back in february			1
@entity1 has not picked @entity33 in his initial squad of 23 , although he is on standby			1
@entity112 , meanwhile , @entity36 and @entity37 lead @entity2 's attack in both the real and @entity10 squads			1
@entity115 says their team was closely aligned with the bookies ’ picks , aside from @entity39 and @entity42 ’s exclusion			0
the company also measured the popularity of @entity1 , and found it to be at a rather favourable 100 per cent positive			1
' for @entity1 , @entity30 was trained to measure positive and negative sentiment , ' the company adds			2
' we have created the ‘ hod - o - meter ’ feature because this particular figure is changing all the time			0
' for instance , after the news that @entity42 did n’t make the team , initial analysis revealed that 61 % of fans thought @entity1 made the wrong choice ( had negative sentiment toward this decision )			2
' within the hour , this dropped to 73 per cent			0
' at the last @entity4 @entity11 says a record 143,199 tweets per second were posted			1
they also say over 10 million @entity4 - related tweets have been posted since the start of the year .			2

company *wds* have used @entity10 to pick @entity2 's @entity4 squad
they monitored tweets to work out which players were the most popular
using this they then created a starting 11 for @entity2 against @entity17
@entity98 midfielder @entity33 , *snubbed* by @entity1 , tops the list
but there 's no room for young stars like @entity77 's @entity91
@entity11 also said that @entity1 has a 100 % *approval* rating from fans
