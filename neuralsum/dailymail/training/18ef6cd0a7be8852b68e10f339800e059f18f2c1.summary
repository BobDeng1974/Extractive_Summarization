@entity0 and @entity2 's bizarre baby name instantly became the subject of jokes around the globe after it was revealed on thursday			1
and it seems even the reality tv star , 32 , found the name @entity9 rather humorous when it was first raised in public during an interview with @entity12 back in march			1
' without batting an eyelash , a giggling @entity0 immediately dismissed the idea and the audience guffawed along with her			2
' that is not one of the names on our list , ' she insisted , before adding : ' but that i do like @entity34			2
' ' it kind of goes with @entity14			2
i think that 's cute , ' she said with a smile			0
despite her chuckles , @entity9 turned out to be no joke - @entity20 obtained a copy of the birth certificate on friday , confirming that the couple have settled on the moniker - and no middle name			1
there was widespread speculation that @entity0 would follow her family 's ' k ' tradition but even back in march she admitted that her baby name list was varied			0
' some of them are k names and some of them are not , ' she said			0
another direction : the 32 - year - old instead offered the name @entity34 , which she thought was ' cute ' mixing things up : @entity0 also said that she 's fond of the trend to give girls names traditionally used for boys news of the baby 's name comes five days after @entity0 was rushed to a hospital in @entity63 on june 15 , giving birth to her daughter after going into labour five weeks before her due date			1
one week later , the pair checked out of the hospital following the premature birth			1
and a source told @entity72 that the couple have already given their daughter a nickname - she will be ' @entity76 for short '			1
proud parents : @entity0 and partner @entity2 welcomed their first child on 15 june while @entity14 was to prove her final choice , @entity0 was said to be very keen on @entity80 , to match her family 's fondness of the letter ' k '			1
the reality star was reported to like the idea of calling the @entity86 for short			1
and further report claimed the middle name would be @entity89 , in honour of @entity2 's late mother , who died in 2007 due to complications from cosmetic surgery			1
nothing official : despite the birth certificate leak , @entity0 has yet to make a statement on the baby 's name meanwhile @entity0 's close friend @entity99 recently revealed that she had been to visit the baby in the hospital and a decision was nearly made			1
but she said @entity0 did n't welcome her suggestions			0
' we kind of went back and forth and the name that i wanted , [ @entity0 ] did n't love , ' she said			0
first for everything : the name of the baby was predicted to start with @entity110 , just like the names of the couple and of @entity0 's siblings @entity0 gave birth to her first child saturday 15 june			2
@entity20 exclusively revealed that the reality star had been admitted to hospital in @entity118 the night before			1
@entity0 had taken out a birthing suite at @entity120 , a hospital of choice among many celebrities including @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			2
something for @entity0 ? @entity0 's stepfather @entity126 was seen stopping by a flower shop in @entity128 on friday hours later - around 1:30 a.m. - she gave birth to her baby girl , now believed to be named @entity14			1
her partner , rapper @entity2 , and mother @entity131 were reportedly at her side			1
@entity0 's due date was reportedly july 12 , just one day after @entity135			0
the date would also have been @entity2 's mother @entity138 's 64th birthday			1
' @entity0 & @entity2 almost named the baby @entity139 , until they heard the infant would then be required to make 3 daily flights to @entity144			1
' @ joelmchale ' sending poor @entity9 my attorney 's number			0
no one should have to go through life with a novelty name , not even a @entity0			0
' @ surisburnbook ' @entity151 , but i 've never been a fan of @entity152			0
' @ @entity153 ' we heard @entity9 months ago			0
it 's like an episode of @entity157 where it turns out that it actually was lupus			0
' @ @entity158 ' @entity159 is thinking , " my name is n't as bad now , is it " ' @ @entity160 ' oh good when kim and kanye ’s daughter has her own fragrance it ’ll be called “ north , by north west ” ' ‏ @ andylevy ' the only way we can fix this and save @entity9 is if we all change our names to @entity14 to make her feel perfectly normal			2
' @ samir ' @entity172 and # @entity2 named their kid @entity9 ? this might be better than @entity175			2
' @ jessi ' @entity9 ? did @entity0 give birth to a baby or a compass ? ' @ @entity179 ' whenever you 're mad at your mom just remember she didnt name you north west ' @ hashtagfranki ' @entity0 and @entity2 would have named their baby @entity139 but that dang airline beat them to it ! ' @ @entity187 ' @entity188 got the stripper name , and @entity9 got the direction to the strip club ? @entity192 , team work			1
' @ @entity194 ' maybe i 'm just getting punk 'd			0
. where you at ? @entity9 is a joke right ? ' @ @entity200 ' y'all making fun of @entity9 for that baby 's name but she going straight to the top ... ... ...			0
and slightly to the left			2
' @ @entity206 ' @entity9 ? way to almost spend a minute thinking of a name			0
' @ @entity208 ' her siblings " @entity139 " , " @entity210 " and " @entity211 " are coming soon ... ' @ djcoreycraig ' we need to successfully abolish bullying before @entity9 gets to 4th grade			0
' @ @entity215 ' @entity0 and @entity2 named their baby " @entity9 "			2
i guess it 's one of the few things in @entity0 ’s life that has n’t gone south ! ' @ jordansammy ' not even @entity0 & kanye 's fortunes combined could pay for the amount of therapy this kid will need for being named @entity9			0
' @ @entity228 ' too late to change to " @entity229 ? " ' @ kenbakernow @entity231 's @entity230 and @entity232 :			0
