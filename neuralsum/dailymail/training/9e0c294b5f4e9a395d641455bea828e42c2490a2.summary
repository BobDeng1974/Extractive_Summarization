most caterpillars tend to rely upon camouflage or being as unpalatable as possible to protect themselves from predators , but the eastern tiger swallowtail has a more unusual approach - it pretends to be a smelly snake			1
the caterpillar of the eastern tiger swallowtail , which is native to @entity8 , has two green ' eyespots ' on the top of its body that makes it look like a snake slithering between the leaves			1
incredibly , when disturbed the insect larvae shoots out two bright orange structures that look like the forked tongue of a snake			1
scroll down for a video the eastern tiger swallowtail pushes out a protrusion that looks like a snake 's forked tongue ( shown above ) and as if resembling a potentially dangerous reptile was not enough to put off hungry birds , the caterpillar has another weapon in its armory			1
having bright colours and distinguishing features is a common way for insects to scare away predators like birds			0
often they help to lure them away from vital body parts or confuse them			0
however , this only works on predators that hunt using sight while bats tend to be immune to such devices			0
now scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the ultrasound used by bats			0
the luna moth has two tails that extend for more than an inch beyond its body			0
scientists in the @entity52 showed that these appendages produce a confusing acoustic signature in the bats echolocation			0
it makes the bats target the end of the tails rather than the moth itself			0
pushing out the orange tongue - like structure - known as an osmeterium - releases a powerful and smelly substance at the same time			1
now scientists have found evidence hidden in the genome of these strange butterflies that helps explain how they developed this in the first place			2
the foul - smelling substance consists of chemicals called terpenes , which are created by enzymes in the caterpillar 's body			1
most butterflies have just one or two of these enzymes , but the eastern tiger swallowtail and its relatives , known as @entity84 butterflies , appear to have many			1
writing in the journal @entity86 , dr @entity87 , a geneticist at @entity88 , said these butterflies exist appear to have broken off from the main branch of the butterfly evolutionary tree			1
he said : ' the @entity84 - specific @entity94 enzymes form a clade in the evolutionary tree			2
' we hypothesized that they could function in a pathway to synthesize predator - repelling terpenes secreted by the osmeterium , a @entity103 - specific organ among butterflies			1
' the researchers used a rapid and cheap dna sequencing technique to assess the genome of the eastern tiger swallowtail			1
the eastern tiger swallowtail caterpillar also has distinctive eyespots ( pictured ) that make it look like a snake by looking like a green snake , like @entity115 vernalis above , the caterpillar is able to frighten off predators the geneticists also found that the butterflies appear to produce more molecules that are sensitive to green , blue and ultraviolet light			1
this , they say , ' may indicate a more advanced colour perception '			0
they also found that the butterflies have mutations in proteins that are responsible for the circadian rhythm - the internal clock that works in cells			1
this , they say , might explain why @entity133 tiger swallowtails mature quickly into adults and hatch from their chrysalises quickly compared to their cousins , the @entity138 tiger swallowtails , which sleep through the winter			2
the scientists also found the @entity133 tiger swallowtails had high numbers of proteins involved in the detection of chemicals from their food			2
other species of @entity84 butterfly , like the black swallowtail above , also use osmeterium to look like snakes dr @entity87 and his colleagues added : ' they are also significantly enriched in proteins involved in the detection of stimuli ( chemosensory ionotropic receptors ) , which may be related to the wide range of food plants they feed on			2
' the butterfly 's genome was found to be 376 million bases , or ' letters ' of dna , long			0
the human genome consists of 3.2 billion bases			0
dr @entity87 said that with the technique they have developed , it may be possible to cheaply sequence the dna of insects to identify them			0
he said : ' with our protocols , the cost per new genome falls below $ 4,000 , making insect sequencing projects feasible			0
' we think the power of comparative genomics can be fully exploited only when there are thousands of genomes available			0
' despite the fearsome appearance of its caterpillar , the adult @entity180 ( above ) is beautiful			2

the eastern tiger swallowtail is native to the east coast of @entity8
its caterpillar has *yellow* eyespots near its head make it look like a snake
when *threatened* the caterpillar pushes out an orange tongue - like ' fork '
this fork also releases smelly chemicals called terpenes at the same time
geneticists at the @entity88 have *studied* the genes responsible
they say these butterflies have far more terpene genes than other species
