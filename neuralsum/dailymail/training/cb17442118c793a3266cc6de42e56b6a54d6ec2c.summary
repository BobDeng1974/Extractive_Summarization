@entity0 once said that the champions of golf are measured by their performances in the majors but there is something that even separates men like @entity0 from the rest			1
it is something that divides the greatest from the great , and something that we have witnessed here at @entity13 this week in the form of @entity15			1
@entity16 had said there is no real weakness in his game and so it proved on the lush fairways of @entity21 , @entity15 withstanding what amounted to a serious attack from the @entity24 with a measured , impressively mature performance			1
the bogeys on five and six			2
not to mention the dreadful tee shot on 13 that enabled @entity16 to close to within two shots of the @entity43			1
but never did he allow @entity16 to move any closer			2
never , even when @entity16 was tearing up this golf course prior to his own mistake in the bunker at 15 , did he relinquish control			2
@entity15 was in control from the gun to the tape over four mesmerising days , taking command of the 143rd @entity29 with a magnificent demonstration of his ability			1
he has been blessed with powers few athletes possess			2
a degree of talent that , when harnessed , makes him simply untouchable ; completely unplayable ; a class apart			2
family affair : @entity15 was joined by his mum @entity61 and dad @entity62 after claiming victory on the @entity64 video the open championship : final round at times , and certainly over the first three days , it was like watching @entity69 in full stride , @entity71 at full stretch , @entity73 at full throttle			1
happy chappy : the new open champion poes with the famous @entity77 it was @entity79 when he had @entity80 comparing him to a @entity82 figure , or @entity83 when a moment ’s improvisation produced a moment as magical as that mule kick against @entity88			2
there was a moment on sunday afternoon when @entity16 dared to dream			0
when an eagle at the tenth was followed by an exchange of looks between player and caddie that said , ‘ hey , we might just have a chance here ’			0
but @entity16 will also reflect on this tournament and remember why , on saturday night , he compared @entity15 to @entity0 at his indomitable best , and perhaps accept that he was always coming from too far back to snatch what would have been his first major			1
so glorious was @entity15 he actually left the rest of the field feeling they were competing for second place in a way that only the finest athletes on the planet do			1
a few hours before delivering what @entity109 considered the performance of the @entity112 , @entity108 offered @entity113 a few words of advice			0
@entity108 informed his fellow @entity116 of his intention to become the first man to cover two laps of the athletics track in less than a minute and 41 seconds that night and suggested it would be unwise to follow him if he wanted to win a medal			0
write caption here at 25 years and two months , @entity15 is the youngest @entity33 champion since @entity0 in 2000			1
woods won it aged 24 years 6 months @entity113 listened , let @entity108 dominate the 800m final from the gun and in the last straight picked off those foolish enough to chase the world record holder to take bronze			0
when @entity71 was at his peak , winning the @entity33 in 2007 without dropping a set and losing only one set en route to securing the third of his seven @entity139 titles in 2005 , the best his rivals could realistically hope for was the prize money for the runner - up			1
to the brand of tennis he was able to produce , a beautiful yet devastating combination of finesse and power , they had no answer			0
armed with a golf club @entity15 also combines that finesse and power , striking the ball not just with perfect timing but with the kind of precision that nobody else could match with such consistency here on the @entity64			1
it was a privilege to watch			0
to see those drives on the fifth on thursday and the 17th on friday , the second of which was just shy of 400 yards			0
@entity15 pointed out afterwards that @entity165 had driven the ball even further on that particular fairway , ignoring the fact that @entity165 is near enough a foot taller than him and built like a basketball player			1
winning combination : @entity15 's father @entity62 banked £ 50,000 after @entity15 won @entity173 this year @entity174 , however , is not the only determining factor			1
accuracy and control are vital components too , as @entity15 demonstrated on saturday with eagles at 16 and 18 that also emphasised the importance of timing of a different kind			1
the timing of an attack , that one coming just as @entity184 and @entity16 were dropping shots			0
this is why @entity15 has become the first @entity190 golfer to win three different majors and why it felt last night like there will be plenty more to come			1
beyond even a career @entity195			0
those close to him certainly see a 25 - year - old now coming of age , just as they see significance in that recent meeting with @entity200			0
perhaps the guidance he took from the greatest golfer of all amounted to the final piece of the jigsaw in creating the champion now in possession of the @entity77			0
all week he has oozed confidence , even when there was talk of his ‘ freaky friday ’ problem after that opening 66			0
that afternoon in the media tent he was completely unfazed ; not the slightest bit rattled			0
it is how the greatest of the greats are , whether they are on a football pitch , a running track , a tennis court or a golf course			2
indeed , after one game at the @entity222 , @entity79 was said to be ‘ from @entity223 ’			0
the same could be said of @entity15			2
he already has a home there after all .			0

@entity15 *triumphed* at @entity21 to claim three of the four golf majors
@entity43 showed why he is one of the true *sporting* greats and is at times unplayable
watching @entity15 was like seeing @entity69 at full stride or @entity71 at full stretch
