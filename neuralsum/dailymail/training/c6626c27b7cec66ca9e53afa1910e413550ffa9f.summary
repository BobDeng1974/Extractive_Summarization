@entity0 died after taking a mouthful of pear drink shipped from the @entity3 which contained lethal levels of cocaine , an inquest heard a @entity9 veteran died after drinking a mouthful from a pear drink shipped from the @entity3 which contained cocaine in a concentration at least 20 times the lethal level , an inquest has heard			1
@entity0 , 33 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , became ill after trying the drink which he spat out because of its bitter taste			2
mr @entity0 , who was working at a food import company , consumed the drink in @entity20 on december 5 last year and died that night at @entity21			1
the inquest jury heard how tests showed that the drink , called @entity24 - imported by his employer @entity25 on behalf of a client - contained an ' overwhelmingly high ' concentration of cocaine			1
@entity28 , coroner for @entity16 , said : ' @entity0 worked for a company which imported food and drink from the @entity3 and distributed them in this country			1
he was a driver and general assistant working mainly on a part - time basis			0
' on december 5 2013 , @entity0 drank from a bottle at his employer 's garage where he was unpacking a delivery of drinks			1
the bottle was labelled @entity24 , a form of pear cordial not normally available in this country			0
' he took only one mouthful and he felt it tasted bitter and spat it out			0
' after this he started to feel unwell and he was taken to hospital by his friends			0
he died later the same day at @entity21			0
' tests of the contents of the bottle showed it had a very high concentration of the drug cocaine in solution			1
' @entity58 , a @entity59 pathologist , said he had been informed that mr @entity0 consumed the drink at the home of his employer and fell ill immediately			1
he said the bottle was part of a consignment of 90 cases imported from the island of @entity68 but the bottle had tested for dissolved cocaine - a smuggling method for the drug			1
he said mr @entity0 was a healthy man whose only medical issue had been a problem with his back which had led to him receiving a medical discharge from the @entity9 in 2012			1
dr @entity58 said : ' @entity77 had inadvertently taken a swig and no more than that from one of the bottles			0
' he said mr @entity0 was obviously ill as he began to shake and collapse and was rushed to hospital by his friends			1
stating that the cause of death was cocaine intoxication , dr @entity58 said toxicology tests showed that mr @entity0 had a ' very high ' cocaine level of 21.3mg per litre of blood , with a fatal level being as low as 1mg			1
the drink would have contained 1g of cocaine in 3ml of liquid			1
he compared the level to that of a drug smuggler who died after four cocaine packages burst in his stomach , leaving him with a level of 4mg/l			0
@entity0 , 33 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , became ill after trying the drink which he spat out because of its bitter taste dr @entity58 said that as a ' naive user ' - someone who was not a cocaine user - the drug would have had a greater effect , and added : ' we are dealing with an overwhelming overdose of the drug			1
' he added that one of mr @entity0 's colleagues put some of the liquid on his tongue and it caused it to go numb for three hours			1
@entity118 , company secretary of @entity119 's @entity25 , said the firm imported drinks from the @entity3 at the request of customers			2
she said : ' in this case we did n't source the drink , we just facilitated the process of bringing it from @entity68 to the @entity129			2
' she explained that the van - load of drinks arrived at @entity133 docks on november 24 and , once duties had been paid , mr @entity0 collected it two days later and took it to the garage at ms @entity118 's home in @entity20 where the company is based			1
she said the company had not ordered any @entity24 drink and she had not come across the brand before			0
she told the hearing at @entity144 that the client paid £ 750 for the consignment			2
ms @entity118 said : ' i was familiar with a drink called @entity149 and i assumed it was linked to this drink			0
' she said mr @entity0 arrived at her home at about 6.30pm with a colleague , @entity152 , with a van of items collected for export			1
she said he picked up a bottle to drink , which he was allowed to do , and she saw him in the kitchen drinking a mouthful from it			2
she said : ' when he had a sip of it he said it did n't taste right			0
i am not sure if he swallowed because he went out to the sink , i do not know how much he swallowed			0
' he was trying to get it all out , trying to make himself sick			0
i asked him when he said it did n't taste right , i asked him if he broke the seal on the bottle , he said yes			0
' she said he complained of the bitter taste from the drink which he pointed out was not carbonated as it should have been and asked for some sugar to get rid of the taste			0
she told the hearing mr @entity0 had said he wanted to get the contents of the bottle tested at a hospital and he left with her partner , @entity119 , and mr @entity152 before he began showing physical problems			1
ms @entity118 said she heard mr @entity0 say to mr @entity119 : ' do not let those people use you			1
' she said : ' he was probably thinking this bottle that he had a drink from probably had come from the customer and they knew exactly what was in the bottle and the company was using the company to get them			2
' she added : ' probably we were a bit naive , it 's not something we thought someone would try to do to us			0
' since this incident we have not imported any drinks , not for the customer , not for ourselves			0
we have taken the decision that any drink we have to source ourselves			0
' ms @entity118 said she had known mr @entity0 , who was paid £ 10 - an - hour for his work , since they had both lived in @entity68 and they had joined the @entity9 at the same time			1
@entity203 of @entity204 said an examination showed the bottle contained 189g of cocaine			2
detective sergeant @entity208 , of @entity209 , said mr @entity0 was taken to @entity210 by mr @entity152 but because it did not have an accident and emergency department he was taken by ambulance to @entity21			1
he said : ' @entity152 steps around the vehicle to open the door for @entity77 who by this stage already appears to be beginning to fit			0
he 's not able to exit the vehicle and collapses			0
' det sgt @entity208 said that once the danger of the drink had been established , the @entity221 issued an alert to local authorities to check for bottles which might have reached shops in the @entity129			0
the jury heard that the pear fruit drink containing deadly levels of cocaine had a street value of up to £ 50,000			2
he said the rest of the consignment was not recovered , including other bottles of @entity24 imported at the same time , and he believed that someone slipped the contaminated bottle into the crates being exported			2
he said the customer , a @entity240 , was investigated but not traced , with her telephone number and email address no longer in use , and he added that he did not believe this was a genuine identity			2
