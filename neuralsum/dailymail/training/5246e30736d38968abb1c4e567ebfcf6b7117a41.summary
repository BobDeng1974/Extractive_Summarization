‘ @entity9 was pottering around but the dog ran up to the hutch , where my three other rabbits were , ’ she said			2
‘ it was barking like mad and scratching at the hutch trying to get at them			2
that was when it turned and saw @entity9			2
‘ it ran up and started shaking him			0

i was screaming and sobbing but there was nothing i could do			0
