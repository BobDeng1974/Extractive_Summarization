by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 07:25 est , 28 july 2013 killed : @entity1 , a @entity4 - @entity3 engineer , was shot dead alongside his wife and mother - in - law in the @entity8 @entity7 two sisters orphaned during a gun attack in the @entity7 in which four died are to be taken out of foster care and returned to their family – under police protection			1
@entity14 and @entity15 have spent the last 10 months under the protection of social services			1
this was mainly because at least one adult member of their own family was under suspicion following the murder of their parents near @entity25 , in eastern @entity8			2
@entity1 , a 50 - year - old satellite engineer from @entity27 and his wife @entity28 , 47 , died alongside the girls ’ grandmother @entity29 , 74 , as they sat in the family @entity32 estate car			2
@entity34 , a 45 - year - old @entity8 cyclist , was also shot dead in the attack on september 5 last year			2
the authorities on both sides of the @entity38 still fear that the girls are in danger because @entity41 is thought to have seen the killer or killers carrying out the attack			1
a @entity46 ruling handed down last week now clears the way for the girls to live with their maternal aunt , uncle and cousin , who can not be named for legal reasons			1
mr @entity53 ruled that the family had been assessed by social services and ‘ have the capacity to care for the girls in these very difficult circumstances which will include a level of police protection ’			1
the judge added : ' it is plainly in their interests to be brought up within their natural family			2
such a placement will sustain links with their family background and may help them over time to come to terms with their tragic loss			0
' the ruling says : ‘ @entity41 and @entity15 have made it clear that they want to live with their aunt and uncle and cousin with whom they have a warm and close relationship			1
’ it continues : ‘ the police do not say that the level of risk is such that they should not be placed with the aunt and uncle ’ , although the ruling insists on the continuation of police protection			1
@entity89 , the children ’s 54 - year - old paternal uncle , was arrested last month at his home in @entity27 on suspicion of being involved in the murders			1
he is on bail awaiting further enquiries into an alleged dispute with his brother @entity96 over their father ’s will			0
@entity89 denies any involvement in the crimes			0
the @entity8 authorities have privately criticised social services in the @entity4 for preventing the girls from being interviewed adequately about the attack , in which @entity41 was pistol whipped and was hit by a bullet in her shoulder			1
last october , mr @entity120 said @entity41 and her father got out of the car after parking in an isolated layby , but mr @entity89 then quickly returned to the vehicle			1
‘ she talked of hearing screams , of seeing violent acts and of her fear , ’ said mr @entity120			0
the @entity132 murders have baffled detectives , with @entity134 being the only arrest in connection with the case			0
mr @entity120 believes an international contract killing may have taken place , with a police source saying : ‘ this was the work of somebody who knew exactly what he was doing			2
whoever carried out this crime had no qualms			0
this was not the work of an amateur			0
’ a total of 21 bullets were fired at the scene and each hit its intended target			0
the bodywork of the @entity32 was unmarked			0
@entity27 police wanted to keep the @entity46 ruling a secret but , in a victory for open justice , @entity162 writer @entity161 challenged an order to exclude him from court			2
lawyers for the newspaper successfully argued that ‘ the right to attend is an important aspect of the media ’s watchdog role ’			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity41 and @entity175 allowed to live with aunt under police protection
they were orphaned when their parents and grandmother were shot in @entity7
another uncle @entity184 was arrested and bailed in relation with the deaths
