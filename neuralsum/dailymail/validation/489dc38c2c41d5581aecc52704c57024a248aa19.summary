' @entity0 ' are paid £ 40,000 a year to spend their days with tens of thousands of fluffy chicks			1
but despite the seemingly attractive offer , @entity3 's poultry industry is struggling to recruit and is now facing a staff shortage that is threatening exports			1
the problem , according to one industry chief , lies in the nature of the job : sexers spend 12 hours a day ' staring at the backside of a chick '			1
and each new recruit must spend three years learning how to do it			2
each future ' chick sexer ' receives years in training in how to spot ' minuscule differences ' in the size and shape of a newly - hatched chick 's genitalia to determine whether it will be a rooster or a hen			1
they are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day - old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent			1
this must be done for as long as it takes to fill an order , which can be up to 13 hours			0
and each chick must have its genitalia - known as its ' vent ' - checked without being harmed , mr large told the @entity53			0
delicate : each chick must be handled with care although the checking technique can be taught relatively quickly , the ability to maintain standards for such long periods at such level of intensity has to be developed over a longer time			0
in 2013 the industry failed to recruit a single ' vent chick sexer ' and asked for the job to be added to an official government list of occupations with staff shortages			1
mr large told @entity53 : ' it takes three years to train someone so they develop the sensitivity and dexterity to reliably sex the bird and a lot of people do n't want to spend that amount of time training			1
' i think the problem is the job itself			0
you are spending hours every day staring at the backside of a chick			2
that is not seen as being attractive			0
' in southeast @entity88 a chick sexer is a high status job			0
in the @entity3 it is more likely to be the butt of humour			2
' there are an estimated 100 to 150 chick sexers in the country but a shortage of 15 workers means the industry risks losing overseas clients			2
but the @entity100 , who advises the government on whether a job should be added to the shortage list , ruled that chick sexing should not be included			0
@entity106 has previously made headlines as a number of the birds - mainly male - are discarded and killed if they are surplus to the requirement of the order			2
when asked by @entity114 whether this could affect the number of jobseekers applying for jobs as chick sexers , mr large said it was not an issue that had been raised with them			0
he added that it was only if the birds did not fit the order , and could not be redirected to meat production , that they were ' humanely culled '			0
waiting to be checked : chick sexers are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day - old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent			1
