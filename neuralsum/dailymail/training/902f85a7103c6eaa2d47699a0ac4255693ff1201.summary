this is the moment a former showjumping horse had to be winched out of a metre - wide well half - full of water , after falling in			1
@entity3 , a 12 - year - old @entity4 had to be pulled to safety in a harness upside down after she became stuck in water inside a well near @entity8 in @entity9			1
two fire crews were called to help the horse after she was heard crying for help after falling through a thin covering of wood over the well			1
@entity3 , a former showjumping horse , had to be winched out of a metre - wide well she had fallen into when crews arrived they could only see the animal 's head and front legs poking out of the water filled well rescuers found her with just her head and front knees poking out and it was unclear how many hours the animal had been stuck for			1
@entity29 , from @entity30 and @entity32 's @entity31 said : ' @entity33 was out of the ordinary			2
' we 'd never seen anything like this before			0
' it 's not a situation that we envisage , so you ca n't train for it			0
' you 'd never think a horse could get into that position in the first place			2
' when we got there we could only see her head , neck and front knees - everything else was submerged			0
' @entity53 's animal rescue team were also called and helped secure a around the front of her body so she could be slowly winched out of the well			1
as the rescue party were n't sure of the success of the operation , they had to request a police marksman for the worst case scenario			0
this was not necessary but in the process of being freed the back of one of @entity3 's knees was cut and fractured and dirty water seeped into the wound			1
this led to a joint infection , and she required eight weeks of intensive care and treatment at @entity76			2
two fire crews were called to winch @entity33 to safety from where she had fallen down into the covered well crews strapped @entity3 to a harness as they began to pull her free from the water and the narrow well it was unclear how long @entity3 had been stuck in the well and the alarm was only raised when she cried out as she was pulled out of the well , @entity3 damaged one of her legs and later contracted a joint infection the animal 's leg was cut and became infected and she needed veterinary care which ran to a total of £ 20,000 this treatment cost £ 20,000 of vet bills to get her back on her feet			1
but the insurance only offered £ 2,000 towards the fees due to a previous tendon condition so the family had to use owner @entity102 's savings and sell her father 's bike to cover the cost			1
miss @entity102 only found out about the fate of her pet after her parents telephoned her after she had completed her first year exams at @entity110			2
she said : ' i 'd just finished my last exam when my dad rung			0
' i knew something had been wrong as he had called earlier in the week asking me to call once i 'd finished			0
' it 's unbelievable how far she 's come in eight months			0
' she 's still a bit wary around crowds of people but apart from that she 's almost fully recovered			0
' miss @entity102 has owned the animal for five years and used to compete in county showjumping events with her			1
the grey mare suffered a fractured back knee from the rescue but eight months after surgery is now back on her feet			2
miss @entity102 added : ' it 's a bit like a car being written off			2
' the insurance company said that due to her tendon problems she was only worth £ 2000			0
' obviously to us she 's invaluable so we 've done whatever was necessary to get her healthy again			0
' i know i 'll never be able to jump her again but seeing her back on her feet was worth it			0
' owner @entity102 said she is relieved the horse is back on her feet again after vets ' bills costing £ 20,000 @entity33 is now back on her feet eight months after the ordeal , which left her with a fractured leg and infection @entity33 is now back on her feet after eight months following the ordeal at the field in @entity8 in @entity9 miss @entity102 used to compete with @entity3 at county showjumping competitions before she became injured			1
