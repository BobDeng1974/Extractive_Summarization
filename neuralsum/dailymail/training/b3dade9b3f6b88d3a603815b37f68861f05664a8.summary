doctors have treated the first case of @entity3 addiction			1
an unnamed man , a 31 - year - old @entity5 navy serviceman , admitted he wore the smart specs for 18 hours a day , removing them only to sleep and wash			1
he admitted feeling irritable and argumentative when he was n't wearing @entity3 , and that he also wore it in his dreams			1
now the first owner has been treated for his addiction to his device after he started to wear it in his dreams			2
internet addiction disorder ( @entity19 ) is characterized by the problematic use of online video games , computer use , and mobile handheld devices			0
while not officially a clinical diagnosis , individuals with @entity19 manifest severe emotional , social , and mental dysfunction in multiple areas of daily activities due to their problematic use of technology and the internet			0
the man had been using @entity11 's technology for around 18 hours a day – removing it only to sleep and wash – and complained of feeling irritable and argumentative when doctors took his glass away			1
in the two months since he bought the device , he had also begun experiencing his dreams as if viewed through the device 's small grey window			2
' during his residential treatment program at the @entity43 's @entity42 and @entity44 ( @entity45 ) for alcohol use disorder , it was noted that the patient exhibited significant frustration and irritability related to not being able to use his @entity3 , ' the doctors wrote in the journal @entity52			1
' the patient exhibited a notable , nearly involuntary movement of the right hand up to his temple area and tapping it with his forefinger			0
' he reported that if he had been prevented from wearing the device while at work , he would become extremely irritable and argumentative			1
' however , the man also had other problems			0
' the patient has a history of a mood disorder most consistent with a substance induced hypomania overlaying a depressive disorder , anxiety disorder with characteristics of social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder , and severe alcohol and tobacco use disorders			0
' the patient was admitted for a 35 day residential programme to beat his @entity3 addiction			1
' over the course of his 35 - day residential treatment , the patient noted a reduction in irritability , reduction in motor movements to his temple to turn on the device , and improvements in his short - term memory and clarity of thought processes			2
the man had been using the technology for around 18 hours a day – removing it only to sleep and wash ' he continued to intermittently experience dreams as if looking through the device			1
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of @entity19 involving problematic use of @entity3			2
' internet addiction disorder was not included as a clinical diagnosis in the 2013 update to the @entity99 , the official reference guide to the field , and many researchers maintain that its effects are merely symptoms of other psychological problems			0
there 's nothing inherently bad about @entity3 , ' @entity105 told @entity108			2
' it 's just that there is very little time between these rushes			0
' so for an individual who 's looking to escape , for an individual who has underlying mental dysregulation , for people with a predisposition for addiction , technology provides a very convenient way to access these rushes			0
' and the danger with wearable technology is that you 're allowed to be almost constantly in the closet , while appearing like you 're present in the moment			0
