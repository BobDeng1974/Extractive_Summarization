lord @entity0 revealed his manifesto for the presidency of athletics ’ world governing body — the @entity6 — and promised he would clamp down on ‘ plastic @entity7 ’ who switch nationality for financial reasons			1
@entity0 , who appears certain to face pole vault great @entity11 in next august ’s election , has included in his manifesto a commitment to making it more attractive for an athlete to stick with the country of their birth , after @entity21 came under fire before the @entity23 for selecting several recently naturalised citizens			1
lord @entity0 is aiming to succeed current @entity6 president @entity25 ( right ) when he steps down next year - reforming the world athletics calendar and bringing in city centre ' street athletics ' competitions			1
- maximising commercial growth and focusing on youth engagement			0
- increasing resources for anti-doping and creating a new @entity6 ethics department			1
- changes to the @entity6 internal structure to give a greater voice for athletes			2
he said : ‘ clearly , there is an issue about transfer of allegiance , where it is based purely on a financial exchange			0
and it is very important that the sport has a proper discussion on this and that we act on it			0
i know there is significant strength of feeling in many continents that this does have to be resolved			0
’ the former double @entity55 champion , 58 , is currently chairman of the @entity56 , executive chairman of @entity58 , a global ambassador for @entity60 and an adviser to @entity62 and @entity64 @entity63 , but insisted that , if appointed by the @entity6 , he would avoid a conflict of interests as he did during his chairmanship of @entity23			2
@entity0 , currently a vice-president of athletics ' world governing body , is standing to succeed @entity25 , who is stepping down in august			1
@entity0 , seen giving a speech at the closing ceremony , headed the @entity23 organising committee @entity0 said : ' to many within and outside our sport , our calendar seems disjointed , lacks a narrative and the essential glue to build excitement and a loyal and passionate following			2
' many fans do n't know when the athletics season starts , when it ends , why it seems to bounce around from the @entity84 to @entity85 to @entity86 and back again			0
a harmonised calendar is the key to promotion , marketing , the athletes and member federation development and we must address this			0
' we need to be more innovative in how we project and present our sport to the world , both in venue and on screen , give serious consideration to an ' @entity99 ' circuit to help reach new audiences , and create a new @entity6 division that has the sole purpose of focussing on youth engagement , especially via social media			1
