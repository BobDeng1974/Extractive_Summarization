by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 29 may 2013 a frantic husband called police after his diabetic wife phoned him from hospital because she desperately needed a sugary drink			1
@entity7 , 62 , had repeatedly pressed her emergency button in the early hours to summon a nurse			1
she was concerned that her blood sugar levels were falling dangerously low and feared she would lose consciousness			1
@entity7 ( pictured here on holiday in 1990 ) had been admitted to @entity15 hospital with a chest infection			1
her husband @entity17 was forced to call the police because nurses repeatedly ignored her calls for help when she feared she was having a ' diabetic hypo ' when no nurse arrived she called her husband , @entity17 , at home			1
he immediately telephoned the ward at @entity26 in @entity27 and spoke to a nurse			2
but after a further 20 minutes a distraught mrs @entity7 phoned him back and said a nurse still had not come to offer her a drink			1
in desperation mr @entity31 telephoned the police to ask for their help but the switchboard operator directed him back to the hospital			1
eventually mrs @entity7 was given a sugary drink which was necessary to prevent her becoming hypoglycaemic , a diabetic condition caused by low blood sugars that can induce a coma and even cause death			1
@entity31 said said he was left with no choice but to dial 999 because he was worried his wife would go into a coma or die			2
mrs @entity7 was eventually given the attention she needed but died four days later after contracting the superbug @entity47 tragically , the great - grandmother died four days later in august last year from chronic heart failure and lung disease , as well as contracting the superbug @entity47 in the hospital			1
last night her husband condemned @entity26 for failing to provide basic life - sustaining drinks for a seriously ill patient			1
mr @entity31 , 54 , said : ‘ what happened to @entity7 in @entity15 was terrifying			2
she rang me around 4am and said she had low blood sugar			1
‘ she said she had been pressing the buzzer for more than 20 minutes , but no one was coming			1
‘ she asked me to ring the landline so i called the ward and spoke to a nurse who said , “ leave it with me ”			2
since the death of his wife , @entity17 ( pictured here on her wedding day in 1986 ) said he has been waiting for answers ‘ but 20 minutes later my wife rang back saying still no one had seen her			1
i tried to call the ward back but the landline was engaged and i could n’t get hold of anyone			0
‘ i did n’t know what to do			0
i was so worried i rang the police			2
‘ eventually , my wife rang back and said someone had been to give her a drink			0
the next day the matron on the ward said i should n’t have rung the police – but what would have happened if @entity7 had n’t been able to call me for help ? she would have been in a coma			1
’ @entity26 has been at the centre of dozens of complaints over standards and is one 14 hospitals identified as needing an in - depth inspection because of its higher than average death rates			0
mr @entity31 is one of more than 100 relatives and former patients who recently met inspectors			0
he has made an official complaint to the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) about his wife ’s treatment			0
he said : ‘ i think the hospital management need a kick up the backside			0
i ca n’t forget how @entity7 was treated			2
’ last night a spokesman for @entity26 said : ‘ we are sorry that mr @entity31 was not reassured following conversations with the @entity99 team and the consultant overseeing his late wife ’s care			0
‘ we are happy to look into his continuing concerns and would urge him to contact us via the complaints co-ordinator			0
’ the case echoes that of diabetic @entity116 who died of dehydration at a @entity119 teaching hospital after he phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty			1
an inquest heard police arrived at his bedside only to be sent away by nurses who said he was confused			2
mr @entity116 , who had previously had a brain tumour , was in a side room in @entity128 , @entity129 , after lashing out at nurses when they would not give him more water			0
a @entity133 inquest heard he called his mother , @entity134 , who said : ‘ he sounded really , really distressed			0
‘ he said , “ they wo n’t give me anything to drink ”			0
he also said , “ i ’ve called the police			2
you better get here quickly , they ’re all standing around the bed getting their stories straight ”			0
’ his mother immediately went to the hospital where she found him delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue			0
she told the inquest that staff tutted at her and refused to listen to her concerns that her son had not been given vital medication			0
recording a narrative verdict , coroner dr @entity151 said : ‘ @entity116 died as a result of dehydration contributed to by neglect			0
