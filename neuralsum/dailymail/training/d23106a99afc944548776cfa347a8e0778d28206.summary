speaking to the @entity39 , ms @entity17 said : ' this is not justice			1
they said i was doing the right thing , that when my son came back they would try to help , but this terrible sentence – all they have done was to set me against my son			2
' the police say " mothers come forward " , you can trust us , we will help			1
but now they will see what happened to my son			0
what kind of person would go to the police if they think their son will get 12 years in prison ? nobody wants to do that			1
i did not want that			0
' my husband just sits silently most of the time , crying a lot			0
' the family were told that the 22 - year - old , whose grandfather served with the @entity69 , might expect a two - year sentence , they said			1
ms @entity72 said her son wanted to come home and that she would have met him in @entity75 but was warned not to by the @entity76 and the police			2
' my son is not a terrorist , he did n’t make bombs , he did n’t kill anyone , he tried to help			0
he did a stupid thing and when he realised this he wanted to come home , ' she said			0
@entity10 left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for @entity3 , but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend @entity23 when they flew back to @entity2 eight months later			1
it read : ' make sure you do n't get any authority involved its ( sic ) a kuffar ( infidel ) government			0

@entity23 also told his childhood friend @entity10 : ' i can not tell anyone i 'm going to do jihad			1
i 'll get arrested ' just before they left @entity11 and joined rebels in @entity128			2
the men were arrested on their return to the @entity2 and pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism acts contrary to @entity135 of the @entity136			2
judge @entity137 said : ' they willingly , enthusiastically and with a great deal of purpose , persistence and determination embarked on a course intended to commit acts of terrorism			0
' after eight months fighting in @entity3 , they were arrested on at @entity146 in january because their worried families tipped off counter-terrorism detectives			1
the judge said they believed in ' violent @entity153 extremism ' and praised the ' extraordinarily brave ' mother who reported her son to the police			1
prosecutor @entity157 said : ' without the mother 's actions , the police would not have been in a position to be waiting for the men on their return			1
' the judge said they had made a careful plan ' to join the ranks of the @entity153 forces ' , adding ' before travelling , you both went to some trouble to fabricate cover - stories '			2
the judge said both men ' intended to be martyred on the battlefield in @entity3 ' and plotted ' to attack @entity175 's forces , with the obvious risk that these intended attacks may have resulted in both military and civilian losses '			1
he also discussed a note written from @entity10 to his mother , which hailed the @entity105			2
' its contents provide an insight into the true purpose of your journey			0
' this was not a spontaneous response to travel to a humanitarian crisis			0
without any doubt , it shows you were travelling to @entity3 intent on jihad '			2
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity23 , both from @entity11 , fled to the war - torn country in may last year after contacting @entity22 extremists online reference books : the pair bought @entity117 for @entity203 , the @entity204 for dummies and @entity206 for @entity203 from @entity120 ahead of their @entity3 trip , where they spent eight months fighting in @entity128 he said the sentences were designed to ' punish , deter and incapacitate ' and ' both of these defendants are fundamentalists who became interested in and then deeply committed to violent extremism '			1
he said he could not be sure the defendants planned to launch attacks in @entity2 , but noted ' the retention of the disk , containing detailed instructions of how to make an ied , is a deeply disturbing feature '			2
he handed both men a jail term of 12 years and 8 months , to be followed by five years on extended license			1
they will be also be subject to counter-terror notification requirements for 30 years			0
the court heard the men fled to @entity3 claiming it was a university trip elsewhere but after returning to @entity2 they told officers they had been doing humanitarian work but a camera containing ' thousands ' of images , including some of them posing with guns on the front line , was found in their luggage			1
traces of ' military - grade explosives ' , including @entity239 and nitro - glycerine were on the men 's clothes and trainers			0
@entity10 's family reported him missing to police in may last year after they found a hand - written letter from him in which said he had left to join a terrorist group called @entity249 ( @entity250 ) - later renamed @entity251 - ' to do jihad '			1
family : @entity10 left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for @entity3 , but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend @entity23 when they flew back to @entity2 eight months later @entity259 : the pair said they were travelling to @entity75 as part of a two - week trip organised by @entity264 ( pictured at @entity146 ) but they then went on to @entity3 officers also found social media and email conversations between the pair and @entity22 extremists			1

@entity23 later asked a @entity280 @entity22 extremist : ' would the brothers in @entity282 accept me ? ' the families of both men had put pressure on them to return to the @entity2 once they discovered where they were			2
days earlier he had told his family he was travelling to @entity75 as part of a two - week trip organised by @entity264 , where he was a part - time computer science student			0
it prompted a search of the men 's homes , which revealed an online conversation between @entity23 and a @entity273 national fighting with the @entity250 , during which @entity23 said he wanted to join the terrorist group			0
@entity298 said the men showed the mind - set to go and join the jihad in @entity3 , before carrying out research , buying equipment , and finally travelling their via @entity75			1
