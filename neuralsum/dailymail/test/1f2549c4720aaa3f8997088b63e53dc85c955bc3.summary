@entity0 has won approval from @entity3 federal regulators to test the latest version of its delivery drone outdoors , less than a month after the e-commerce powerhouse blasted regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing			1
the @entity10 had earlier given the green light to an @entity0 prototype drone in march , but the company told @entity3 lawmakers less than a week later that the prototype had already become obsolete while it waited more than six months for the agency 's permission			1
the @entity10 granted @entity0 's request to test its new delivery drones in a letter dated wednesday , posted on the agency 's website			1
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds			0
about 86 percent of @entity0 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said			2
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making @entity31 available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' @entity0 has said			2
@entity0 must keep flights at an altitude of no more than 400 feet ( 120 meters ) and no faster than 100 miles per hour ( 160 km per hour ) , according to the letter			2
@entity42 - based @entity0 has been pursuing its goal of sending packages to customers by air , using small , self - piloted aircraft , even as it faces public concern about safety and privacy			2
the company wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers over distances of 10 miles ( 16 km ) or more , which would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft			0
in february , the @entity10 proposed long - awaited rules to try to set @entity3 guidelines for drones , addressing growing interest from both individual and corporations in using unmanned aerial vehicles			1
@entity0 did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
previously the firm blasted federal regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing - and warned the @entity3 is falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area of unmanned aviation technology			1
less than a week after the @entity10 gave @entity0 the green light to test a delivery drone outdoors , the company told @entity3 lawmakers that the prototype drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more than six months for the agency 's permission			1
' nowhere outside of the @entity3 have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing , ' @entity83 said in written testimony submitted to the @entity87 on @entity88			0
@entity83 said @entity0 had applied on friday for permission to test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker approval			1
the @entity0 case illustrates the frustrations of many companies and industry lobbyists , who say the @entity3 regulatory process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for a range of industries			1
@entity83 , who was scheduled to join a witness panel at the subcommittee hearing , said @entity106 and other international authorities have more ' reasonable ' approaches that recognize the potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations			0
' this low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate , especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries , ' @entity83 said			0
' the ( @entity10 ) already has adequate statutory authority			0
' what the @entity10 needs is impetus , lest the @entity3 fall further behind , ' he added			0
the @entity10 recently proposed rules that would lift the current ban on most commercial drone flights , but several restrictions attached would make package delivery and other business applications unfeasible			1
among other constraints , the proposed rules would limit commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet ( 150 metres ) , allow flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the aircraft in sight at all times			0
the agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late 2016 or early 2017 , according to government officials .			0
