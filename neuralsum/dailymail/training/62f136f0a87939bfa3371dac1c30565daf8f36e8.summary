by @entity0 in @entity2 , the sky was red with fireworks			0
in the suburbs of @entity6 , the streets were packed in celebration			0
in @entity9 itself , the whole country reached a frenzy of euphoria			2
@entity9 has waited a long time for this			2
they should have reached the second phase of the @entity17 in 1982 ; finally , 32 years on , a draw against @entity19 took them out of the group for the first time			1
that 1982 side lives on in the romantic imagination as one of the great what - might - have - beens			2
four years earlier , @entity28 had beaten @entity29 to become the first @entity31 side to win a match at the @entity17 , but that achievement was nothing to the shock of @entity9 ’s win over @entity37 in @entity38			1
past glory : the @entity41 coach and players celebrate victory in 1982 when they beat @entity37 revenge : @entity9 were knocked out despite winning in ' 82 after the ' @entity45 ' - now they want revenge they then lost to @entity49 but beat @entity50 and would have gone through with any result other than a narrow @entity53 victory over @entity49 in their final game — a match played after @entity9 ’s last game			1
@entity37 , of course , won what became known as the @entity61 match 1 - 0 and @entity9 , in the cruellest circumstances , were out			1
‘ we have not forgotten , ’ @entity9 ’s @entity64 coach @entity63 warned before the tournament			1
he also has unfinished business at the @entity17			2
he was part of the @entity69 squad in @entity70 , but was largely kept out of the side by @entity72 , who coached @entity64 at this @entity17			2
then he should have taken @entity73 to the @entity74 , only to be sacked following defeat to — coincidentally — @entity9 in the quarter - final of the @entity77			1
his side took the lead with a minute to go , only to concede an injury - time equaliser and then a winner two minutes into extra-time			2
the rest of the world — @entity41 included — may be surprised by what the country have achieved , but @entity63 has always given the impression that he expected progress to at least the round of 16			1
delight : @entity41 fans around the world , and particularly in @entity93 , celebrated widly last week diaspora : many of the @entity41 team , were born in @entity93 where last - 16 qualification was celebrated ‘ i ’ve succeeded wherever i ’ve been , ’ he shrugged			1
he won a league title and an @entity99 with @entity100			0
he took @entity101 to promotion and then into the @entity99			0
he saved @entity103 from relegation			0
he won the league with @entity106			0
he is as irascible as he is intelligent , but he has been successful			0
he is also utterly his own man			0
@entity63 retired from his playing career following the death of his mother			2
during the @entity111 , he returned to @entity112 to defend his home and remained even after being wounded , only leaving after @entity115 nationalists threatened his life , eventually destroying his home			0
he has a clear idea of how football should be played and has reshaped the @entity41 game to that image			2
when @entity9 shocked @entity37 they were an attractive side based around the direct attacking play of the likes of @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
success : @entity130 has taken @entity9 further than many outside the country expected unique : @entity130 , who has had a difficult relationship with the @entity17 , is confident in his own abilities @entity136 was supposed to be three giants plus @entity138 , yet it was the @entity140 side who came top of the group			1
their method is simple : pack men behind the ball and look to break using the playmaking ability of @entity149 and the lone front - running of @entity151			2
@entity152 were a shambles in qualifying , with @entity155 their fourth coach in 12 months			0
but they got to @entity157 in the end , and they have been defensively sound and neat in possession , inspired by the goalkeeping of @entity161 and the calm of @entity163 , 35			0
@entity164 ‘ one day i will be in charge of @entity164 , and then they will know what a coach is , ’ said @entity165 in 2006			0
he has been as good as his word , ending a 19 - year trophy drought by winning the @entity77 then leading them to the last 16 of the @entity17			1
@entity175 in the @entity176 is improving , but few would have picked them to get past @entity177 and @entity178			0
they are extremely fit and have a tremendous spirit and , if they were fortunate to beat @entity178 , they were much the better side in drawing 2 - 2 with the @entity181			0
they retained that reputation through the @entity184 when they were regular contenders for the @entity77 before finally winning it on home soil in 1990			0
the civil war of the @entity189 broke up that side , though , and more recently @entity9 have become more noted for the sort of dour defence they demonstrated in drawing 0 - 0 with @entity194 at the last @entity17			1
@entity63 , though , has unleashed the attacking instinct of @entity41 football			1
they are good to watch again and the coach must take credit for that			0
the other key figure in the creation of this side has been the president of the football federation , @entity204			0
moment of joy : @entity208 headed home against @entity19 to send @entity9 into the last 16 for the first time not only did he work with tremendous energy to keep football alive during the worst days of the war , but he lobbied @entity214 to change their rules on national eligibility			1
as a result , @entity9 have been able to draw from the vast diaspora to the extent that 16 of the 23 - man squad were born in @entity93			1
as ever , results outweigh all else , and if @entity9 could shock @entity37 and gain their revenge for 1982 , every member of the side would be celebrated wherever there are @entity41 .			1

@entity9 were knocked out of 1982 @entity17 when @entity37 and @entity49 played out match with 1 - 0 result that put both through
32 years on they meet @entity37 in first ever last - 16 match
@entity63 has built a team that play attractive football
@entity9 face @entity37 on monday night in @entity237
