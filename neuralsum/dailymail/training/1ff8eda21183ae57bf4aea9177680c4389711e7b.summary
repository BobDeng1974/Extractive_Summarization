a trio of advisers to the president warned a congressional committee on wednesday that @entity4 and the @entity5 are competing against each other to be the dominant terrorist group and that rivalry could lead to an attack on the @entity10 responding to a question from @entity14 rep. @entity13 , secretary of homeland security @entity15 , @entity18 director @entity17 , and @entity19 director @entity11 expressed concern over the tug - of - war and acceded that @entity4 may be trying to reassert itself as the leading global terrorist network			1
' these groups are in competition with one another for attention , for fundraising , for recruitment , and one way to compete is to show that you 're the biggest and baddest group out there , ' @entity15 told members of the @entity33			1
' the logic of it is compelling , ' @entity17 concurred			2
' you 're not going to be the leader in the global jihad without striking @entity10			1
' @entity10 homeland security secretary @entity15 , center , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) @entity17 , left , and director of the @entity19 @entity11 , right , appeared before the @entity33 today to update members on ' @entity42 ' @entity43 said the recent announcement by @entity4 of a new affiliate in @entity46 could be interpreted as an indication that it 's trying to reaffirm its supremacy			1
@entity4 and @entity50 were once a part of the terrorist group in @entity53 but the two groups parted ways earlier this year as the @entity5 's tactics became increasingly barbaric			1
since then , @entity4 has denied any affiliation between their group and @entity50			0
they are now in ' what appears to be a competition ' to ' see who is the true heir apparent to [ @entity66 ] @entity66 , ' @entity33 chairman @entity61 told his colleagues during today 's hearing			0
' it 's a dangerous competition			0
and the way i see it , is to up the ante , what better way to do that than to attack the @entity78 , ' he expounded			0
@entity61 said in a statement at the start of the hearing that the @entity10 needs to only only rollback @entity50 in @entity53 , it needs to ' destroy them wherever they emerge ' lest they grow to become an even greater threat to the @entity10 ' let us be clear , our nation is at war with this group and the twisted ideology it is seeking to spread , ' he said			1
and ' if we do not take the fight to the enemy oversees , we risk having to fight them here at home			0
' the @entity98 @entity14 's comments came as new evidence of @entity50 ' designs on the @entity10 emerged online			1
a @entity102 - style film trailer released by @entity50 on tuesday that claims to be a preview of what is ' coming soon ' suggests the terrorist group may attack the @entity106 if the president enlists @entity10 combat troops to fight alongside the @entity53 army			1
while the the 52 - second video , which has since been removed by @entity111 , does not explicitly name the @entity106 as a target , footage of the the president 's quarters alludes to the group 's intentions			0
in a speech to servicemen and women at @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124 , this afternoon , president @entity118 admonished the extremist group and promised that the @entity10 would hunt down and destroy them			1
' whether in @entity53 or in @entity127 , ' the president said , ' these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of @entity4 already know : we mean what we say			0
' ' our reach is long			0
if you threaten @entity10 , you will find no safe haven			1
we will find you eventually , ' he added			0
ominous : a new @entity50 video , which has since been taken down by @entity111 , includes a brief and shaky clip of the @entity106 as a car drives past - clearly threatening the home of the @entity10 president @entity144 police officers stand guard in @entity146 on wednesday after a blog affiliated with the @entity5 in @entity53 and @entity127 ( @entity50 ) mentioned the iconic city center as a target for bombing president @entity118 admonished @entity50 this afternoon and promised the group that ' if you threaten @entity10 , you will find no safe haven			1
we will find you eventually ' the @entity10 intelligence community believes that @entity50 has now convinced as many as 30,000 people , including 15,000 foreigners , to join its missions in @entity53 and @entity127			2
the @entity160 estimates that 100 @entity10 have also joined @entity50 ' ranks , and @entity10 officials fear that they could return home and commit acts of terrorism			2
during today 's @entity167 hearing @entity61 pressed the @entity118 administration officials on their level of ' confidence ' that the government capturing @entity10 aligned with @entity50			1
' we have a reasonable degree of confidence , not a high degree of confidence ... that we know the numbers and who is attempting to travel , ' @entity15 told him			2
@entity17 explained that his agency spends its whole day ' sorting among that group to find the bad guys ' and that it is able to jail many of them before they leave the country or as they attempt to come back			2
but given the nature of the group , @entity17 said , he 's not ' over confident ' about their ability to catch each and every one of them			0
the @entity18 chief assured @entity61 that agents scour the internet looking for people who have been radicalized , however , ' in a country this big and this free , ' he said , it 's sometimes difficult to arrest people before they 've committed a crime			0
and while the @entity18 is ' interested ' in suspending the passports of suspected would be terrorists like the @entity199 government , @entity17 later said , that may be a violation of due process rights			0
members of @entity203 have also voiced angst over the possibility of jihadists sneaking into the @entity10 through its porous border with @entity208			0
@entity15 and other members of @entity118 's cabinet have repeatedly stated that they 've seen no evidence of an imminent threat from @entity50 at home or abroad			1
' having said that , we do need to be vigilant , ' @entity15 said today			0
' we do need to be aware of the risk of potential infiltration by @entity50 or any other terrorist group			2

homeland security secretary @entity15 told a congressional committee ' one way to compete is to show that you 're the biggest and baddest group '
' you 're not going to be the leader in the global jihad without striking @entity10 , ' *fbi* director @entity17 concurred
the hearing came as new evidence emerged that @entity50 may try to attack the @entity106
*speaking* at a *military* base this afternoon , @entity118 told the terrorist group , ' if you threaten @entity10 , you will find no safe haven '
