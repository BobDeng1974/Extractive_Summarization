there appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary in the parking lot of this @entity5 apartment complex - until a speeding fighter jet dropped out of the sky and crashed there in a fiery wreck			1
part of the dramatic april 6 crash were captured by a security camera that was rotating just yards away from where the @entity13 slammed to earth			1
the two - seater f - 18 jet crashed into the @entity18 apartment complex , about a mile from the @entity19 , , after suffering a ' catastrophic mechanical malfunction ' during a training flight			1
the jet is moving so fast that it can only be seen in two frames of the video			2
and even in those two frames , it is just a blur			0
while the camera was not fixed on the building at the time of the crash , the moment of impact can be seen in a reflection on a car door , glowing bright orange as flames erupt from the downed jet			2
as the tape continues rolling , a driver appears not to notice what had just happened as he calmly exits the parking lot			1
response : moments after the crash , police and firefighters can be seen arriving at the scene flames : callers flooded 911 following the sudden impact of the jet into the apartment complex in @entity5 inferno : though the pilots expelled most of the fuel before crashing , the fuselage caught ablaze as people called for help moments later , residents , police and firefighters are on the scene to deal with the emergency situation			1
miraculously , no one on the ground was killed , and both pilots had ejected safely from the plane			2
three three buildings and damaging more than 65 of the housing units of the @entity18 were destroyed , and several residents were hospitalized with smoke and stress - related injuries			0
the pilots ejected from the plane and are credited with saving lives by dumping their fuel seconds before impact			0
aircraft : the jet was an @entity105 , similar to the one seen here concerns : there are no known fatalities from the dramatic crash , but three elderly residents who lived in the apartment block are unaccounted for wrecked : an aerial view of the apartments shows the roofs of several buildings completely destroyed @entity116 , the @entity117 division chief , said that it seemed like the pilots were dumping the jet â€™s fuel prior to the crash			1
that action likely prevented a massive fireball upon impact , he said			0
' he mitigated what could have been an absolute massive , massive fireball			0
with all of that jet fuel dumped , it was much less than what it could have been			0
' the @entity132 said that the jet was an @entity105 assigned to @entity134 106 based at @entity135			2
it crashed shortly after takeoff at a site near the base at about 12:05pm			0
