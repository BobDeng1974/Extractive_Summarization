the remains of @entity1 , 22 , make the first complete skeleton to be recovered from the battle of @entity4 200 years ago the 200 - year - old skeleton of a soldier killed at the battle of @entity4 has been discovered under a car park - just like @entity8 - and identified by archaeologists			1
after a painstaking process historians identified the man as @entity12 , 23 , a @entity14 hunchback who trained in the @entity17 resort of @entity18			1
@entity12 , a member of @entity21 ’s @entity20 , was killed by @entity23 ’s forces and was found with a musket ball between his ribs , the @entity19 reported			1
an archaeologist working for the @entity28 government , @entity29 , called the find ‘ unique , ’ explaining that no complete skeleton had ever been retrieved from the battle of @entity4			1
the mystery surrounding @entity12 ’s origins and identity was cracked by @entity35 , 54 , a former @entity36 officer and historian , who said @entity12 would never have been allowed to serve , because of his deformity , under modern military standards			2
however his @entity14 unit , loyal to the king , would have fought alongside @entity43 and @entity44 troops against @entity23 the skeleton was uncovered in june 2012 when a digger excavated a car park near the @entity49 ’s @entity48 at @entity4 battlefield just south of @entity51			1
it took three years of intense research and a little luck to pin - point @entity12 ’s identity			2
a piece of wood carrying the initials cb , and the date 1792 as well as 20 @entity60 and @entity61 coins amounting to a month ’s wages and an iron spoon proved crucial			1
the team at @entity4 had to use the process of elimination to identify their unknown soldier and could not rely on dna tests like those used by the group that discovered @entity8 under a car park in @entity73 in 2012			2
because , unlike @entity8 , none of @entity12 ’s relatives were known , historians had to use what little records remain from the 1815 battle at @entity4 to piece together the story			1
@entity81 recognised the skeleton carried deformities indicating severe spinal issues			0
further tests put the skeleton ’s age at death between 20 and 29			0
the musket ball that killed the young soldier was found lodged between his ribs at the @entity4 battlefield killed apparently by a musket ball which was found between the recently identified soldier 's rib bones the team was ready to give up on the case until @entity35 , treasurer of the @entity98 and author of @entity4 : myth and @entity100 , matched troop formations to where the body was found and was able to identify the fallen soldier as a member of the @entity60 legion			1
using the information he was able to calculate that the soldier was probably killed between 1pm and 4pm when his unit marched on a ridge at @entity112			0
then in february an important clue was brought to light when a piece of wood originally believed to be inscribed with the initials @entity118 actually showed @entity119			2
the letter @entity121 had faded over time			0
@entity12 was killed most likely between 1pm and 4pm at @entity49 which now stands as a monument to the dead this painting by @entity126 captures the moment @entity130 's @entity129 - @entity44 army clashed with the @entity61 using this vital piece of information @entity35 found that only two soldiers with the initials had been killed at the battle			1
he was able to rule one of the pair out after consulting payment records dating back to august 1815			0
eventually the historian was left with @entity12 , a private in the @entity20 ’s second line battalion			2
it appears that @entity12 was single as no one came forward to make a widow ’s pension claim following his death			0
@entity28 archaeologist @entity29 shows the place where he found the remains of the @entity60 soldier while the @entity60 soldier would originally have trained in @entity151 , based there until 1814 , it is likely that at the outbreak of war he was located in @entity154			0
an estimated 50,000 died at @entity4 with a proportion of the dead burnt and then buried in mass graves			0
other bodies were sold commercially as fertiliser or their teeth were sold as dentures			0
@entity12 ’s skeleton will feature in an exhibition to be unveiled at @entity4 in may			1
@entity28 archaeologist @entity29 examines the teeth and jaw of remains belonging to the soldier			0

the remains are the first complete skeleton to be recovered from @entity4
a piece of wood , a spoon and a month 's wages turned out to be vital clues
