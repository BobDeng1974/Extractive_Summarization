at first sight , it could be the catwalk equivalent of the emperor 's new clothes			0
and though the lithe models sashaying down the catwalk on the first day of @entity7 were at least partially clad , @entity9 's debut collection for @entity10 is not for the faint - hearted			1
from nude body stockings to see - through skin - coloured crop tops , the outfits were entirely unforgiving - and strictly for the body confident			1
but while public opinion is still out , the bizarre ensembles do at least have one famous fan in the shape of @entity9 's wife , @entity20			1
we 're not used to seeing miss @entity43 in anything but form fitting designer duds , but we 're really loving this loose look on her			0
that @entity48 oversized jacket is everything ! unfortunately it 's not available to buy just yet though			0
the reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990 's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of @entity55 camouflage pants just the other day			0
take a page from @entity20 's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below			2
both @entity62 and @entity63 make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a @entity68 jacket on sale for only $ 73.95 ! our favorite item here at @entity72 is a @entity74 's mixed media camo bomber , which at $ 140.00 is also a style steal			0
rothco the @entity75 at @entity76 ( now $ 73.95 ) visit site @entity78 at @entity79 visit site @entity81 at @entity82 visit site @entity84 at @entity85 visit site the 34 - year - old reality tv star liked the look so much , she even posted an @entity90 photo of herself in one of the sheer ensembles , adding the legend : ' my look for the @entity96 ! ! ! ! ! ! yeezy head to toe ! ! ! ! ! ' critics similarly seemed to enjoy @entity9 's latest fashion offerings with @entity100 saying : ' @entity9 's @entity7 collection with @entity10 lives up to the hype			1
' the very fact that he had the fashion bible 's editor - in - chief , @entity107 , and top designer @entity108 sitting front row at the show was testimony to to mr @entity9 's popularity			1
in a review posted on the fashion magazine 's website they seem notably impressed at the fact that @entity9 had managed to persuade @entity10 to drop their traditional three stripe logo from his designs , a feat never achieved by their previous collaborators			1
they said : ' @entity123 were raw and frayed , tops billowy , bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned boosts			0
' there were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they ’ve actually taken shrapnel , and everything was said to be unisex			0
concluding : ' on display , in rigid lines of expressionless youth , it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear			0
' sportswear : @entity9 said he wanted to design a range of ' solutions based ' clothing different shapes and sizes : @entity9 has been praised for using models of different shapes , sizes and races fashion royalty : @entity100 editor @entity107 attended the show posing her with @entity20 and @entity9 however much like anything @entity9 does the show did n't come without controversy			1
from guests complaining they had to wait an hour in the cold for the event to start , to his daughter @entity160 screaming the house down mid show			0
and of course @entity9 , who is known for his impassioned and sometimes angry rants , could n't resist making a dig at the fashion industry , even whilst he was trying to impress them			2
in an early review of the collection , @entity168 commented that @entity9 seems to be , ' perpetually running defense , clearly still wounded by the criticism directed at his previous design endeavors			1
' indeed it was reported that he played a track over the top of the show telling his audience : ' i want to create something better for you			0
' we have been limited			0
it 's bigger than who i am even in my present living			0
it 's about what when i was on earth what did i do to help ? ' he went on to say : ' i 'm here to crack the pavement and make new ground			0
' there 's a lack of creativity in every field … people are afraid to create			0
i want people to think awesome is possible			0
' but did he manage to crack that pavement ? well , yes and no. @entity9 certainly has n't faced the same level of criticism that he has for his previous forays into the fashion world			2
praised : the show is the first time @entity9 has received praise for his attempts at fashion design casual : as well as the body suits some models wore relaxed sweatshirts and jumpers family affair : @entity20 's younger sister @entity216 was featured in the show rocking a parred back look refinery 29 noted that @entity9 's collection probably would sell well saying : ' it was a lineup of oversized jackets , sweatshirts , sweaters , and leggings , interspersed with @entity225 nude - colored underwear			1
' a camo parka that @entity20 also wore was a highlight , and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that 'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials			2
' he has also been praised for using a variety of models , notably men and women of different races , shapes and sizes			2
' short , tall , sample size , not sample - size ... while the diversity in the show was n't quite a true - to - life cross-section of @entity249 ( or even the subway car during your morning commute ) , it was a more interesting line - up of bodies than what we normally see during @entity7 , ' said @entity256			1
one notable face was his wife 's younger sister @entity216 , who appeared on the run way looking fresh - faced in comparison to her usual made up look			2
perfect parker : the collection featured baggy coats which sat over the body - stockings walk that walk : @entity216 looked as the models walked past in some of @entity9 's more brightly coloured designs @entity9 claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of ' solutions based clothing , ' saying , ' i do n't want the clothes to be the life , i want the clothes to help the life			1
' it is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans			0
and the show certainly was n't without support from a whole host of his famous friends			0
from @entity290 and @entity291 to @entity292			1
@entity290 praised the collection saying : ' i thought it was beautiful			1
i loved how the ladies lined up			0
' she was referring to the army like line - up of models which @entity9 has revealed was inspired by the @entity301 which were going on when he started designing the collection			1
it was this inspiration that @entity305 believed helped the designs , they said : ' it was that suggestion of conflict that gave some spine to this collaboration with @entity10 : a protective toughness , a body - conscious severity that made the clothes more than a simple accessory to the footwear that was the predictable focus of the whole event			1
' the footwear they reference is the @entity320 - which @entity9 himself wore for the presentation			1
camo : this model wore a camo jacket and the @entity327 trainers which @entity9 himself wore for the show @entity9 's army : the model 's stood in an army - like formation wearing their outfits designed by the rapper @entity9 was n't alone in creating his show taking advice and inspiration from artist @entity340 on staging			1
he told @entity341 of working with her : ' me and @entity225 and her husband @entity344 just kept bouncing ideas			0
' she really pushed and drove it to be something that was her absolute communication against the idea of bags that you could buy at the adidas store			0
' @entity341 further praised @entity9 for his latest attempt at fashion			2
they said : ' he 's certainly trying			0
@entity9 's earnest commitment to fashion saw its fullest expression to date in this show , which blended artistic elements in an interesting way			2
' for lest we not forget mr @entity9 's previous fashion work has never earnt him the acclaim he so desperately seems to desire			2
when he released a womens - wear collection in @entity367 it was widely @entity368 said @entity9 should , ' @entity369 to the day job			1
' the @entity371 bemoaned @entity9 's designs , criticising the models over-sized shoes and likening his attempts at design to when @entity377 did a line for @entity379 - which was a resounding flop			1
then when in 2013 he released a capsule collection with @entity382 questioned , ' @entity9 's @entity382 collection : the new boring ? ' so to win praise is certainly a step forward for @entity9 although it remains to be seen whether his clothes will be as popular with the public as they are with the editors			2
famous friends : the show was attended by the likes of @entity290 and @entity107 , however , @entity9 's daughter @entity160 had to be carried out after throwing a tantrum designer pals : @entity395 sat front row next to @entity108 , @entity397 and @entity292			1

models were seen wearing nude body suits and see - through crop tops
his wife @entity20 arrived wearing the designs
