by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 16 august 2013 @entity2 girls being taken abroad for forced marriages are being urged to hide spoons under their clothes in order to alert authorities to their plight			1
as @entity2 puts airport staff on alert to spot potential victims , one campaigning group says the trick has saved some youngsters from coerced unions in @entity16			1
the concealed cutlery sets off the metal detector at security control in @entity2			1
girls - and sometimes boys - can then be taken away from their parents to be searched , which gives them a last chance to seek help from airport staff			1
thousands of young women are being taken ' on holiday ' to marry a stranger in a country they do n't know the @entity2 school summer holidays , now well under way , mark a peak in reports of young people - typically girls aged 15 and 16 - being taken abroad on ' holiday ' , for marriage without consent , the government says			1
the bleep at airport security may be the last chance they get to escape a union to someone they have never met in a country they have never seen			1
the spoon trick is the brainchild of the @entity53 charity , which supports victims and survivors of forced marriage and honour - based abuse			1
based in @entity59 , central @entity60 , it fields an average of 6,500 calls per year from around @entity2			1
however , the organisation says this number has already been reached with another four and a half months to go until the end of 2013			1
it says this increase is due to increased awareness of the issue			0
when petrified youngsters ring , ' if they do n’t know exactly when it may happen or if it ’s going to happen , we advise them to put a spoon in their underwear , ' said @entity76 , @entity53 ’s operations manager			1
when the girls go though security , the spoon will set off the alarm - if 16 or over , they will be taken away to a safe space when the spoon sets off an alarm , ' they will be taken to a safe space where they have that one last opportunity to disclose they ’re being forced to marry , ' @entity76 told @entity88			1
' we ’ve had people ring and tell us that it ’s helped them and got them out of a dangerous situation			0
it ’s an incredibly difficult thing to do with your family around you - but they wo n’t be aware you have done it			0
it ’s a safe way			0
' the charity is working with airports - so far @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , with @entity102 to come - to spot potential waring signs , such as one - way tickets , the time of year , age of the person and whether they look uncomfortable			2
' these are quite general points , but there are things that if you look collectively lead you to believe something more sinister is going on , ' said @entity76			0
people who come forward can be escorted out of a secure airport exit to help outside			0
marriages without consent have led to suicides and so - called honour killings			2
officials fear the number of victims coming forward is just the tip of the iceberg , with few community leaders prepared to speak out and risk losing their support base			2
one woman , whose identity has been protected by @entity128 in southeast @entity60 , was forced to get married in @entity129			2
she said she was threatened by her father ' because he said if i thought about running away he would find me and kill me '			0
' i was shipped off with a total stranger			2
' that night i was raped by my husband and this abuse continued for about eight and half years of my life			2
last year , the @entity140 ’s @entity139 dealt with some 1,500 cases - 18 per cent of them men			0
a third of cases involved children aged under 17			0
the oldest victim was aged 71 ; the youngest just two			0
the cases related to 60 countries : almost half were linked to @entity149 , 11 per cent to @entity150 , eight per cent to @entity129 , and two per cent to @entity151			0
other countries involved included @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			0
calls to @entity53 tend to spike before the @entity2 school summer holidays and again at the end , said @entity76			1
' the holidays are a really good time for young people to go missing because there is nobody accounting for where they are at school , ' she said			0
since @entity168 ended last week , calls have risen again , including one from an 18 - year - old who has fallen pregnant - her family is trying force her into marriage to conceal it			2
burdened by codes of ' izzat ' , or family honour , youngsters can be put under extreme physical and emotional pressure to marry relatives in a culture and country they were not brought up in			1
if they refuse , they are often threatened with being thrown out of the family - or worse			0
' it really takes a brave person to stand up against their family , ' said @entity76			0
' in june 2012 , the government announced that forced marriage will become a criminal offence and by doing so we are sending out a clear message that this brutal practice is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the @entity2			1
' the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) provides direct assistance to victims as well as undertaking a full programme of outreach activity to practitioners and communities , to ensure that people who are in contact with victims are fully informed about how to approach such cases			2
statutory guidance is already available to support those agencies that exercise public functions to safeguard children or vulnerable adults			0
' this year the @entity139 is handing out " marriage : it 's your choice ” cards , to all professionals across the @entity2 , including airport staff , safeguarding professionals , teachers and @entity211			1
these cards will provide victims and potential victims with key information , in addition to signposting them to where further confidential advice and support can be obtained			2
