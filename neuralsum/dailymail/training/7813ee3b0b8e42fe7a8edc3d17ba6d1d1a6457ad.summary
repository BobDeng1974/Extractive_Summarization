the family of a man who died in 2010 believe he too may have been the victim of the the @entity3 poisoning scandal			0
campaigners have called for a fresh probe into @entity7 ’s worst ever mass tapwater poisoning incident after it has been linked to the death of @entity10			1
drinking supplies were polluted when tonnes of aluminium sulphate were tipped into the wrong tank at the @entity16 treatment works in @entity17 , @entity18 in july 1988			0
last year an inquest ruled that @entity20 ( pictured when younger ) possessed abnormal levels of the metal aluminium in her brain when she died aged aged 59 last year a coroner said it may have contributed to the death of @entity20 , 59 , who died in 2004			1
@entity20 suffered with a rare neurological disease and was found with high levels of aluminium in her brain			1
now the family mr @entity10 say new tests have shown that he had similarly high levels of aluminium sulphate in his brain when he died aged 60 in 2010			1
they said initial tests were inconclusive but a second set has proved that he had similar levels of aluminium as ms @entity20			1
mr @entity41 ’s son - in - law @entity40 said : ' after his death we asked for tests to be performed to establish if there was any evidence of aluminium accumulation in his brain tissue			1
' ' initial tests were performed , which proved to be inconclusive for aluminium			0
' unfortunately these tests were performed on small samples of tissue rather than the whole brain			2
the @entity54 in @entity17 ( pictured ) was the scene of a terrible accident when tonnes of aluminum were accidentally dumped into the local water supply ' we requested that the test be re-run but using the whole brain to establish if there was any accumulation			2
' after the second test it turns out that @entity10 ’s brain did indeed have high levels of aluminium particularly in the hippocampus , the area of the brain responsible for short term memory			1
' the two people tested for brain aluminium levels , @entity20 and now @entity10 , have shown high levels of aluminium in their brain tissue			1
' this evidence shows the need for further study amongst the population exposed in july 1988			0
' the poisoning occurred when a relief delivery driver inadvertently dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate directly into the unmanned treatment works			0
the alumininium sulphate was then pumped into the water system to @entity89 's customers			0
there were widespread complaints of stomach cramps , ulcers aching joints and even hair turning green			0
the incident polluted the supply to 20,000 people but authorities insisted it was safe and even suggested the ' foul ' taste could be disguised by mixing it with orange juice			0
locals quickly began reporting stomach cramps , rashes , diarrhoea , mouth ulcers and aching joints - some even complained that their hair turned green			0
mr @entity10 , of @entity112 , @entity18 , later complained of short - term memory loss , osteoporosis , osteoarthritis and kidney damage			2
he also suffered with decaying finger and toe nails , skin problems and recurring gum and ear infections , which he believed were linked to the contaminated water			1
a recent study by the government - appointed @entity124 of the @entity126 said there was ' no conclusive link ' between the leak and the chronic symptoms and diseases reported			0
but it called for further research to examine the long - term neurological effects on young childrenand babies born in the immediate aftermath .			2

last year a coroner ruled that contaminated water may have been responsible for death of @entity20 , 59
new tests have shown that when @entity10 died age 60 , he too had high levels of aluminum in his brain
government *committee* said that more research is needed to examine effect of metal those exposed
