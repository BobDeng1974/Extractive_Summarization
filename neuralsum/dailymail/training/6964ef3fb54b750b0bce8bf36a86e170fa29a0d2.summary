by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 6 november 2012 researchers have observed the brightest flare - up yet seen from the black hole at the heart of our @entity6 galaxy			2
as supermassive black holes go , @entity8 is relatively quiet , giving off roughly as much energy as the sun - in spite of the fact it is some 4billion times as big			1
about once a day , however , it emits a burst of light - a phenomenon scientists have been keen to investigate to get a better understanding of how black holes evolve			1
@entity20 : this false - color image shows the central region of our @entity6 as seen by @entity25 's @entity24 , with a flare from the @entity8 black hole visible as a bright , point - like source at the centre of the image now an international team using @entity25 's @entity24 have detected the brightest flare yet observed from @entity8 , which for an hour glowed some 150 times brighter than the black hole 's usual luminosity			1
they say the brief burst of activity may offer a vital clue about how mature black holes behave			1
@entity40 , postdoctoral associate at @entity42 's @entity41 , told @entity43 : ' we ’re learning what black holes do when they ’re old			1
' they ’re no young whippersnappers like quasars , but they ’re still active , and how they ’re active is an interesting question			0
' as black holes swallow nearby matter , they emit light energy which allows astronomers to detect them			1
however , while the centres of newborn galaxies and quasars spew huge amounts of energy as they devour matter around them , older black holes tend to slow down as they age , consuming less and appearing fainter			1
brief : this animation shows the unexplained hour - long burst of light detected emanating from @entity8 in february which scientists say could offer clues as to how supermassive black holes evolve an influential astrophysicist hired by @entity69 to pinpoint the location of @entity72 ’s home planet , @entity73 , has done just that			1
the fictional planet @entity73 would have orbited a red dwarf star called @entity77 , says @entity78 , director of the @entity80 's @entity79 in @entity81			0
the star is 27.1 light - years from @entity83 in the southern constellation @entity85 , also known as ‘ @entity86 ’ , says dr. @entity78			0
the star is cooler and smaller than our sun. ‘ this is a major milestone in the @entity72 mythos that gives our super hero a place in the universe , ’ @entity69 co-publisher @entity90 said in a company statement			0
‘ having @entity78 in the book was one thing , but by applying real - world science to this story he has forever changed @entity72 ’s place in history , ’ he said			0
‘ now fans will be able to look up at the night ’s sky and say , “ that ’s where @entity72 was born ”			0
’ while the popular idea of black holes is like a vacuum sucking up everything that drifts by , @entity113 , a research scientist explains that ' in this really low - accretion - rate state they ’re really finicky eaters , and for some reason they actually blow away most of the energy			2
' however , an analysis of @entity8 made by @entity120 on february 9 showed a spike of 700 photons - 150 times brighter than its usual luminosity			1
' suddenly , for whatever reason , @entity8 is eating a lot more , ' said @entity128 research scientist @entity127			0
' one theory is that every so often , an asteroid gets close to the black hole , the black hole stretches and rips it to pieces , and eats the material and turns it into radiation , so you see these big flares			0
' dr @entity127 told @entity43 that he suspects such flare - ups occur more frequently than scientists had previously thought and the team have now reserved more than a month on @entity24 to observe @entity8 in the hopes of detecting more and finding out what is causing them			2
another question the team hopes to investigate is why the black hole gives off so little energy			0
dr @entity113 in 2003 calculated that given the amount of gas surrounding it , @entity8 should be a million times brighter			2
his findings suggested that the black hole is actually throwing away most of the matter that floats into its gravitational pull - the physics of which remains a puzzle that could explain the history of our galaxy .			0

flare up measured at 150 times the usual luminosity of @entity8
scientists believe further study could reveal how older black holes behave
