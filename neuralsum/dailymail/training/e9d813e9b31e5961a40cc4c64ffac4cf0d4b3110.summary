by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 18:09 est , 17 july 2013 new chief inspector of @entity2 , sir @entity3 , has called for hundreds of @entity5 patients to join inspection teams over next 2 years patients are being recruited to inspect hospitals as part of a drastic new measures to root - out poor care			1
they will form 15 - strong squads with doctors and nurses which will carry out thorough investigations of all @entity5 trusts over the next two years			1
the @entity18 yesterday unveiled plans of a major overhaul of the way it inspects hospitals following concerns that substandard care was being missed			0
on tuesday , the government announced that of the worst @entity5 11 trusts were being put into special measures with teams of outside experts sent - in to make urgent improvements			2
it followed a major investigation of hospitals with high death rates which uncovered widespread failings including desperate shortages of nurses and doctors , a lack of compassion and poor hygiene standards			2
but it has since emerged that nine of these 11 failing trusts had previously been passed as safe by the @entity18			0
only two - @entity46 and @entity47 , in @entity48 and @entity49 - had been given warning notices and told to they needed to make improvements			0
the @entity18 ’s new chief inspector of hospitals , professor sir @entity3 , admitted yesterday ( @entity55 ) the previous @entity18 inspections had been ‘ flawed			1
’ he said : ‘ we acknowledge the system was flawed and we would n’t be changing it if it was n’t			0
’ sir @entity3 , who formerly worked as the government ’s cancer tsar improving diagnosis rates and treatment , added : ‘ there is too much variation in the quality of care patients receive - poor hospitals need to up their game and learn from the best			1
‘ i will not tolerate poor or mediocre care			0
’ the watchdog has been repeatedly criticised for missing poor care and last month it emerged that it had passed the maternity unit at @entity77 in @entity78 as safe even though babies and mothers had died unnecessarily			0
under sir @entity3 ' new leadership , patients will join forces with medical professionals to assess @entity5 hospitals			1
the methods used to grade each hospital trust will be similar to the system used by @entity90 when inspecting schools and last month the chair of the @entity18 @entity92 admitted that until recently policemen and firemen were being sent in to inspect hospitals rather than doctors and nurses			1
from august , teams of five to six doctors , five to six nurses and five to six patients and relatives will be sent to inspect all 170 @entity5 trusts in @entity105			1
they will spend at least two days monitoring care and speaking to staff and relatives and will also carry out an unannounced inspection at nights and weekends			0
each trust will be given one of four ratings - outstanding , good , requires improvement , or poor - similar to the system used by @entity90 when grading schools			1
hospitals rated as poor will be put into special measures unless the @entity18 is confident its bosses are capable of making the urgent improvements themselves			0
the @entity18 has lined up the first wave of 18 trusts which will be inspected between august and december - and they will enable the watchdog to test its new system			2
they include six trusts where the watchdog expects to find poor care - based on previous inspections and complaints - which include @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 in @entity48 , @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity2 , @entity140 and the @entity141 and @entity143 hospitals			2
another six are deemed to be of medium standard , while six are expected to be providing a high quality care			0
patients and relatives wanting to join the inspection teams will undergo a series of interviews and criminal records checks			1
they will be paid for each inspection - although the amount has not yet been decided - and will be reimbursed for any travel costs			2
but they will only be allowed to inspect hospitals more than 50 miles from where they live to ensure their opinion of the hospital is impartial and not tainted by their own previous experiences .			0
