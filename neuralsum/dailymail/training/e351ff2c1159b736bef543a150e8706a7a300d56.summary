by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 mayor madame @entity2 has proposed a ' @entity5 ' hostel in the town for 400 migrants a children ’s summer camp set in idyllic surroundings on the outskirts of @entity3 could soon become home to hundreds of destitute @entity13 bound migrants			1
the town ’s mayor , madame @entity2 , has proposed a ‘ @entity5 ’ hostel for 400 migrants to appease the local population of the port where currently 1300 @entity20 and @entity21 are squatting in sordid camps and disused buildings			0
sources say the @entity26 leisure camp set in open countryside next to a beach and sand dunes looking over to the white cliffs of @entity31 is the most likely of four potential locations favoured by local politicians			1
the camp ’s buildings are capable of housing several hundred people and are fully equipped with sanitary , shower and cooking facilities			0
it is located about three miles from the town centre and the ferry terminal			0
both @entity43 and president of a charity organisation which feeds migrants , @entity47 , are both said to favour the summer camp			2
but the @entity26 camp ’s proximity to the port ’s ferry terminal and trucker ’s depots is likely to enrage lorry drivers who regularly clash with migrants attempting to break into their trailers and stow away to the @entity13 on ferries to @entity31			1
if the camp is turned into ‘ @entity61 ’ migrants would be able to take shortcuts through the sand dunes passing @entity64 @entity66 bunkers and reach the truckers ’ depots within half an hour on foot			1
meanwhile , the former director of the original @entity61 hostel run by the @entity72 has warned that the creation of new state - run hostel would escalate the number of migrants coming to @entity3 , causing more chaos			0
in an interview with newspaper @entity82 du @entity80 , said when @entity61 was created in october 1999 the number of people arriving tripled in just three months			0
@entity3 currently has 1300 @entity86 and @entity21 squatters who are living in sordid camps and disused building the porposed site for the camp overlooks the white cliffs of @entity31 , and is a short walk to the local port and truckers depots the majority of @entity3 migrants are camping at what has been dubbed ‘ @entity97 ’ , a vast open air squat with no running water or toilets situated on land owned by a chemical factory			1
hundreds more migrants are being housed and fed in huts provided by local village councils and charity groups at @entity107 and @entity108 near @entity109 as well as @entity110 on the motorway south of @entity3			0
in early august the factory obtained a court order for the eviction of the migrants at ‘ @entity97 ’ but @entity3 prefect @entity116 announced he would only bulldoze the camp after migrants had been informed of their asylum rights in @entity120 .			2

the @entity26 leisure camp overlooking @entity31 is the most likely location
the camp would allow migrants to reach trucker *'s* depots within 30 minutes
it is *feared* they may break into trucks or stow away to the @entity13
