she was rushed to hospital but died later that evening , an inquest at @entity28 heard			0
forensic pathologist dr @entity30 said she had an underlying hypertensive heart disease which caused her death			1
but the doctor added that the stress of the vandalism may have lead to her dying			1
he said in a statement : ' it seems logical to consider the upset and anger caused by the incident was capable of placing increased physiological demands upon her heart			2
' whilst i can not be certain it seems reasonable to conclude that the stress apparently caused by the incident has probably made some contribution to this woman 's death by exacerbating her underlying heart disease , although she could have died suddenly from the heart disease			1
' neighbour @entity55 said after the stone was thrown he helped her find a shovel to clean up the broken glass and they both went into her house			0
he said : ' i thought she tripped over the door frame			2

she was taken to @entity86 but sadly died there			0
' the coroner added : ' it can not be clearly established that there is a definite link between mrs @entity1 's death being caused by what happened			1
' the pathologist says it may have made some contribution , but he also says she could have collapsed at any time			2
' the court also heard from detective chief inspector @entity99 , the chief investigating officer into mrs @entity1 's death			1
he told how the police had identified four youths who were in the vicinity in @entity103 , @entity4 , @entity80 , at around 5.30pm on november 27 last year			0
they were arrested in connection with both the damage to the elderly lady 's house and also her death			0
