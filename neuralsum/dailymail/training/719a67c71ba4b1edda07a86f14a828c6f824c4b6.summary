by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 09:33 est , 6 november 2012 it 's every plane passenger 's worst nightmare - but a surprisingly good premise for a film			2
unfortunately , it seems @entity7 's portrayal of a fully - functioning alcoholic pilot in the new film flight is n't going down well with everyone			1
@entity12 @entity11 has asked @entity13 to obscure or remove the @entity15 logo from scenes of the movie showing @entity19 's character drinking the beer while in the cockpit			1
and the distributor of @entity23 has made a similar request - despite the film already showing in @entity27 cinemas and grossing £ 15.7m in its debut weekend			1
sobering : @entity7 plays an alcoholic pilot in the film flight , which opened in @entity27 cinemas last weekend , but some drinks companies are not happy with the portrayal of their products @entity19 's character frequently drinks vodka throughout the film , with several different brands represented			1
but @entity38 , who distribute @entity23 in the @entity27 , said it did not license its brand for inclusion and would have refused permission if asked			0
@entity43 , a spokesman for the company , said the company had a strict code for how their vodka was portrayed in films and wanted to market it responsibly			0
' considering the subject matter of this film , it is not something in which we would have participated , ' he said			2
alcoholic : @entity19 plays pilot @entity55 in the @entity13 film , a drunk pilot who is forced to make an emergency landing on a supposedly routine flight between @entity60 and @entity61 @entity62 , vice president of @entity15 , said his company had not been contacted by @entity13 or the production company of director @entity65 for permission			1
' we would never condone the misuse of our products , and have a long history of promoting responsible drinking and preventing drunk driving , ' he said			0
' we have asked the studio to obscure the @entity15 trademark in current digital copies of the movie and on all subsequent adaptations of the film , including dvd , on demand , @entity82 and additional prints not yet distributed to theatres			1
' a spokesman for mr @entity65 referred questions to @entity13 , which did not return a message seeking comment			1
bottle it : @entity11 , the brewer of @entity15 , has called for all logos to be obscured or removed in the film flight			1
@entity19 's character is seen drinking @entity15 at the controls regrettably for the drinks companies , experts say there 's little they can do about it legally			1
' trademark laws ' do n't exists to give companies the right to control and censor movies and tv shows that might happen to include real - world items , ' said @entity103 , a resident fellow at @entity105 's @entity104			0
' it is the case that often film - makers get paid by companies to include their products			2
i think that 's sort of led to a culture where they expect they 'll have control			0
that 's not a right the trademark law gives them			0
' @entity121 , a professor at @entity122 , said the use of brands in films had generally been protected by the courts , even when the companies are not pleased with the portrayals			0
' it would n't have been effective as film if we used a bunch of non-generic brands , ' said prof @entity134 , who is also the director of the school 's @entity135			2
' in a normal situation , if the alcohol were just there as a smaller part of the movie , they might have created an artificial brand for it			0
' other vodka brands , including @entity146 and @entity147 , are also included in the film			0
representatives of those companies did not return messages seeking comment .			0
