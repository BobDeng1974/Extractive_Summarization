the mother and maternal grandparents of an 8 - year - old @entity3 boy doctors said ' looked like a @entity5 survivor ' were ordered on thursday to stand trial on attempted murder and other charges for allegedly denying the boy food regularly and hiding him from public view			1
district judge @entity12 was so shocked by pictures presented in court and by medical reports of the boy 's condition after he was removed from the family 's @entity19 home in june that the judge ordered the three defendants jailed and set bail at $ 100,000 each			1
police allege the boy was fed only small amounts of food so he turned to eating bugs when he was allowed onto the back porch			1
trial set : @entity31 , in white , and her mother , @entity33 , center , are lead by sheriff 's deputies from the courthouse to an awaiting police vehicle on thursday the boy was 7 and weighed 25 pounds when caseworkers took him to @entity41 , where a doctor reported : ' the young man is so emaciated he looks like a @entity5 survivor			1
' a doctor said he was one month from dying			0
the judge 's decision drew applause from about 60 courtroom spectators - friends , relatives and some complete strangers to the boy - some of whom gasped when the pictures a @entity56 caseworker took of the boy this summer were flashed on a video screen minutes earlier			1
lawyers for the boy 's mother , @entity64 , 28 ; his grandmother , @entity60 , 48 ; and his step - grandfather , @entity62 , 59 ; expressed disappointment that their clients were jailed			1

tragic : @entity62 , left , and @entity31 , right are accused of starving the 8 - year - old boy			1
the boy was removed from his home in june when a neighbor noticed his ' skeletal ' appearance ' i think there 's no question what happened here was a tragedy , but the question is who 's responsible for it and whether it 's a criminal offense , ' @entity31 's attorney @entity78 said			2
@entity88 , an attorney for the grandmother , told the judge the adults may be guilty of not seeking proper medical attention for a boy who ' had trouble keeping his weight on ' but nothing more			2
' it sounds more to me like a situation that got away from them , ' @entity88 said			0
county detective @entity100 , one of two witnesses at the hearing , has said he believes the grandmother disliked the boy and influenced the others to mistreat him , but the detective did n't testify about that thursday			2
he told the judge that one next door neighbor thought @entity31 , who has four children , had only three children because the neighbor only saw two girls and a boy playing outside			2
district attorney @entity113 said the starved boy - identified in testimony only by his initials @entity117 - was purposely kept from public view			1
when a neighbor finally did see him on june 6 , she called to report ' what she said appeared to be a walking skeleton , ' county welfare worker @entity119 testified			0
home : one next door neighbor thought @entity31 , who has four children , had only three children because the neighbor only saw two girls and a boy playing outside the home , pictured medical personnel noted that the boy 's bones protruded so sharply that his skin broke open in some areas , and a doctor at @entity134 of @entity135 in @entity136 , where he was eventually transferred , concluded he was a month from dying			0
@entity60 's attorney noted that the boy told a caseworker he ate three meals a day , was treated kindly , and sometimes forced himself to vomit after meals			1
but the prosecutor said the boy ate and gained weight normally once he was hospitalized , and has gained about 20 pounds			0
@entity113 said the boy 's statements that he was decently treated can be explained by his perspective as a child			0
' he does n't know that they 're trying to kill him , ' @entity113 said			0
' all four of @entity31 's children have been placed in foster care .			0
