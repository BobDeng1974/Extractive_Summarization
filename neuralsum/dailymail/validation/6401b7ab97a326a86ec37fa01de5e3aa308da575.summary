museums give a snapshot of the past but their static displays struggle to truly emulate what it would have been like to live in an ancient era			0
now an archaeologist is hoping to merge the present with the past using augmented reality to make people feel as if they have travelled back in time			1
the @entity12 app puts virtual buildings on top of real world images , and his @entity12 ’s nose bag emits odours to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past			1
the @entity12 prototype was developed by dr @entity21 from @entity22			1
it uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world ( virtual huts are shown on the site of a prehistoric settlement on @entity29 , @entity30 )			1
the setup uses the camera on an @entity33 and an augmented reality app the prototype applications and hardware were developed by dr @entity21 , an honorary research associate at the @entity37 ( @entity22 ) and a member of l - p : archaeology			1
@entity41 uses an @entity33 ’s gps to pinpoint the user ’s location			2
when they hold the @entity33 ’s camera up to the landscape , virtual reconstructions are placed on top of the real world images			1
these reconstructions move and change in real - time as the user moves around the terrain			0
it uses a mixture of the @entity57 gaming engine and @entity59 ’s augmented reality technology to place the virtual layers in their correct location and perspective - taken from archaeological data - based on where the user is stood			1
' augmented reality enables us to give glimpses into the past - that are not possible if you are just walking around a site or indeed part of a city of a rural field in the middle of nowhere , ' dr eve told @entity77			1
' these ' experiences ' could be easily recreated within a virtual reality environment , by donning an @entity80 and some @entity82 gloves we can see and touch the past			1
during the @entity86 the site on @entity85 was a tin - mining village			0
when dr eve held the camera up to the hill ( left ) a series of huts appeared to make it look like he was exploring the ancient village ( right )			1
these reconstructions move and change in real - time as the user moves around the terrain to make this experience more immersive , the archaeologist also developed the @entity100 ( shown being worn by dr eve )			1
it can emit specific smells and these could include the smell of barbecues wafting through a virtual scene , or the bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure ' however , by creating the whole experience within a computer and then donning a pair of closed goggles - we run the risk of cutting ourselves off from the real world - and creating bands of zombies plugged into computers who never have any experience of the real world and instead choose to live within a virtual world - with all interactions mediated through a computer			1

@entity147 ’s nose is a prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts smells to the user 's nose based on their location			1
the hardware is built using an @entity158 microcontroller and computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user ’s choice			0
software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and ‘ fires off ’ smells when connected to the @entity57 technology , for example			2
consequently the smells are released at the correct time and location as the user explores			0
in one example dr eve used his technology on the side of @entity29 , in the middle of @entity85 in @entity30			0
during the @entity86 the site was a tin - mining village			0
when dr eve held the camera up to the hill a series of huts appear to make it look like he ’s exploring the prehistoric settlement			2
‘ seeing a reconstruction of the village that can be physically explored when you are standing in the real location is a visceral experience and , for me , comes pretty close to a time machine , ’ added dr eve			1
to make this experience more immersive , dr eve has also developed the @entity12 ’s nose bag			1
the devices can either be placed around the landscape to emit specific smells , or worn by the user as they explore the augmented world			2
for example , the smell of barbecues could be wafted through scene or a bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure			0
‘ @entity147 ’s nose is a very early prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts certain smells gently into your nose based on your location , ’ said dr eve			1
the hardware uses an @entity158 microcontroller with standard computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user ’s choice			0
software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and ‘ fires off ’ smells when connected to the @entity57 technology , for example			2
the @entity225 ( prototype shown ) uses an @entity158 microcontroller with standard computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user ’s choice			0
software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and ‘ fires off ’ smells when connected to the @entity57 technology , for example in a similar project , the @entity234 's @entity233 app lets people walk side - by - side with @entity238 from the 19th and 20th century			2
the app recognises a user 's location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives in february last year the @entity234 updated its @entity233 app to let people walk side - by - side with @entity238 from the 19th and 20th century			2
for those using the app on the move , the app recognises their location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives			0
each historic photograph was taken by a renowned photographer , including @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260			0
there are more than 100 locations and images ranging from 1868 to 2003			0
consequently the smells can be released at the correct time and location as the user explores			0
‘ technological development is moving at an incredible rate , and already it is possible to wear transparent glasses with forward - facing cameras to overlay the @entity275 information directly onto your field of vision , rather than having to use a portable handheld device such as a mobile telephone ’ continued dr eve			1
‘ as this develops further , this will go some way towards mitigating the disconnectedness of having to hold up a mobile device in order to experience the virtual objects			2
’ the name of the prototypes was taken from the @entity291 ' short story , ‘ @entity292 ) ’			0
in the story , character mr @entity293 discovers a pair of field glasses and when he looks through them , he sees the past			0
' it is really exciting stuff and the technology is in its infancy - but as with any new thing - it has to be carefully led in the right way , otherwise it will just end us up in some dystopic future where we get things beamed directly to our brains ! ' concluded dr eve			0

the @entity12 prototype was developed by dr @entity21
it uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world
setup uses the camera on an @entity33 to see the virtual world on the screen
this can include anything from a reconstruction of a wall to entire villages
dr @entity339 has also created a prototype ‘ @entity100 ’ device
this emits odours designed to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past
