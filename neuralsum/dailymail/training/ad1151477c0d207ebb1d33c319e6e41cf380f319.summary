a marketing ploy launched by @entity1 in an effort to win back customers has backfired after it was deemed insensitive in light of two air tragedies that killed more than 500 people			1
the struggling airline has changed the wording of its ‘ @entity11 ’ contest – promoted just months after the twin air disasters – after it was widely criticised for the word choice			2
‘ bucket list ’ is a term that refers to the things a person wants to experience before they die			1
insensitive : @entity1 has been criticised for a free flight giveaway named ' @entity11 ' the ‘ @entity11 ’ free flight giveaway was offered to customers in @entity24 and @entity25 , but the campaign turned into a disastrous public relations move for an airline that is desperately trying to revive its image			1
@entity1 ’ ill - conceived contest asked customers who had already booked flights to submit an entry and , in 500 characters or less , explain which destinations are on their bucket list for a chance to win one of 12 economy class return tickets to @entity39 or an @entity40			1
it said : ‘ what and where would you like to tick off on your bucket list , and explain why ? ' the state - owned airline has pulled references of ‘ @entity11 ’ off its website , with links now directing to error pages			1
the contest still exists but it is now asking customers to describe their ‘ ultimate to - do list '			1
in a statement provided to @entity57 , the airline confirmed it has altered the contest 's name and it did not intend to offend anyone			2
it said : ‘ @entity1 has withdrawn the title of a recent competition running in @entity24 and @entity25 , as it is found to be inappropriate at this point in time			1
’ ‘ the competition had been earlier approved as it was themed around a common phrase that is used in both countries			0
‘ the airline appreciates and respects the sentiments of the public and in no way did it intend to offend any parties			0
‘ the initiative of the competition is designed to inspire and encourage travellers to dream , plan and book their next holiday with @entity1			2
’ @entity77 tragedies : @entity39 army personnel carry the remains of victims who were aboard @entity81 people were quick to criticise the airline for its word choice			0
twitter user @entity85 wrote : ‘ @entity1 calls their new promotion “ @entity11 ” – seriously ! u know what that means , right ? ’ a user named @entity90 said : ‘ this is a sick , sick joke , right ? ! marketing / @entity92 needs to be fired			2
’ @entity93 wrote : ‘ can there be a worst competition name than @entity1 ( @entity1 ) ’s “ @entity11 ” competition ’			0
[ sic ] in addition to giving away free flights , the cash - strapped airline has slashed prices on certain routes after being hit by plunging ticket sales following the tragedies			1
photos posted on social media have shown nearly empty cabins on some flights			0
heartbroken : the wife of flight mh17 captain @entity110 carries his portrait as victims ' bodies are returned the airline was already struggling with financial woes when the disasters occurred , and last week it announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs as part of a £ 1.1 billion overhaul that is expected to lead to some routes being eliminated			0
in july , 298 passengers and crew were killed when @entity81 was shot down over eastern @entity124 – in an area controlled by @entity127 separatists – while it was en route to @entity130 from @entity131			0
and 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after @entity134 , travelling from @entity130 to @entity135 , veered far off course and disappeared over the @entity136 in march			0
no wreckage has been found and the plane is thought to have crashed some 1,100 miles off @entity24 's west coast .			0

@entity1 opened contest to *residents* of @entity24 and @entity25
