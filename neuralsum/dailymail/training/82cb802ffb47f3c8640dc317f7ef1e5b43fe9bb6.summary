by @entity0 published : 03:21 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 11 june 2013 on high streets where many shops still lie empty as they recover from the worst recession in @entity6 since the 1930s , one type of business has continued to thrive in the economic gloom			1
bookmakers have swamped the @entity6 's shopping parades – with numbers up 25 per cent since 2008 - and in one @entity14 borough , @entity15 , there are currently 82 - six per square mile			1
around almost every corner in this generally deprived part of @entity14 are shops where people can stake £ 100 a spin on casino - style gambling machines , which are as addictive as crack cocaine			2
yesterday @entity25 was in court to defend its decision to block plans for a new @entity30 shop , and if they win it could lead to hundreds of betting shop licences nationwide being turned down or revoked			1
concentrated : this graphic shows the main areas which have been saturated by betting shops in @entity15 , @entity14 , which has 82 bookmakers the local council say these bookmakers , often open for 14 hours a day , fuel violent crime , street drinking and underage gambling			1
a source from within the council said : ‘ we mapped out where crimes and disorder take place and compared that with where the betting shops are – and it lit up like a christmas tree '			1
earlier this year they rejected an application for the new betting shop on the grounds that it would make more money from gaming machines than from traditional betting on horses and sports results , saying this meant it fell foul of the @entity64			0
councillor @entity65 , chairman of the licensing sub-committee , said : ‘ we are the first council to invoke the primacy clause to reject a licence application , as we are unconvinced that at least half of the gambling on premises would have been traditional betting			0
‘ we are increasingly concerned about the number of gaming machines in @entity15 and their impact on our high streets			2
‘ not only that , we are concerned at the high proportion of incidents of crime and disorder and that betting shops are part of the problem			1
’ battle : critics say that betting shops are filled with fixed odds betting terminals , which are as addictive as crack cocaine contrast : @entity15 is one of @entity6 's poorest boroughs yet it has one of the highest number of bookies in the country , raising questions about whether bookmakers target poor areas 1 ) @entity99 2 ) @entity100 3 ) @entity15 4 ) @entity101 5 ) @entity102 6 ) @entity103 7 ) @entity104 8 ) @entity105 9 ) @entity106 10 ) @entity107 upon @entity108 source : @entity110 , 2011 @entity30 has said it will not comment until the case ends , with a decision due by magistrates on wednesday			1
@entity15 frequently appears high up lists of the most deprived areas of @entity6 , along with nearby @entity14 boroughs such as @entity100 and @entity104			1
it is an area of high immigration , and has been thought to be in serious economic decline since the fall of manufacturing and the closure of the nearby @entity121			0
the @entity122 at @entity123 is located within @entity15 , but it has yet to be seen whether the complex will have its desired effect of revitalising the borough and bringing employment back to the area			2
@entity129 , 32 , who runs a phone card stall on @entity131 , where the @entity30 could still appear if they win the legal battle , says that these shops are damaging lives			1
' they have a bad effect on young people , it 's too easy to lose money			0
it brings problems to the area			0
the gambling creates problems : fighting in the streets , drinking			0
there is a bigger problem coming in the future , ' he told the @entity151			0
until now , town halls have complained that they can block betting shop applications only if there is evidence that there will be an increase in crime , a threat to the vulnerable , or there is proof of unfair gambling , which is difficult to establish before a shop has opened			2
legal fight : @entity15 is locked in the courts with @entity30 as the council tries to stop the opening of another betting shop in their area , as they say there are too many ( examples in @entity174 , above left to bottom right ) previous decisions to reject applications have often been overturned on appeal			1
in many cases , councils withdraw their objections as they are liable for costs if they lose			0
this has led to accusations that councils are being ‘ bullied ’ by expensive legal teams brought in by the bookies			2
the @entity187 said previously that @entity15 ’s decision to throw out the application was ‘ at odds with the @entity192 ’s advice and guidance on this issue			0
‘ there is a misconception that there must be more profit or turnover from betting than machines to satisfy primary gambling activity			0
that is simply not the case			0

@entity25 is in court because they say bookies fuel street crime
legal battle with @entity30 could allow other councils to refuse licences
borough is one of @entity6 's poorest , but has some of the most betting shops
@entity15 has been ranked the third most deprived area of @entity218
