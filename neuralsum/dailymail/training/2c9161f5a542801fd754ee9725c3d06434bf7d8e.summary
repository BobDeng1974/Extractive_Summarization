by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 25 september 2012 plans by the @entity3 government to switch its citizens ' internet to a domestic network to ' improve security ' have been described as a deliberate attempt to control their access to the web			1
officials said the move will improve the country 's protection against cyber attacks , but many @entity3 believe it is the latest tactic to restrict and filter information online			1
the announcement was made by a government deputy minister on sunday and came as state television announced @entity21 's search engine and its email service would be blocked ' within a few hours '			0
vital communication tool : dissidents in @entity3 have previously used social networks , like @entity26 , to organise demonstrations ( file picture ) in the televised announcement , an official - identified only by his last name , @entity31 - said : ' @entity21 and @entity33 will be filtered throughout the country until further notice			1
' no further details were given			0
the @entity21 ban was thought to be connected to the @entity39 film posted on the company 's @entity41 site which has caused outrage throughout the @entity45 world , according to the @entity46 ( @entity46 )			0
however , there was no official confirmation of this			0
@entity3 has one of the biggest internet filters of any country in the world , preventing normal @entity3 from accessing countless sites on the official grounds they are offensive or criminal			1
however , many @entity3 believe the block on sites such as @entity60 and @entity41 is due to their use in anti-government protests after the disputed re-election of president @entity64 in 2009			1
sites expressing views considered anti-government are also routinely blocked			0
virtual private network ( @entity69 ) software , which makes the computer appear as if it is based in another country , is commonly used by @entity3 to overcome the government filter			1
however , officials have long spoken of creating an @entity3 internet system which would be largely isolated from the @entity76			1
protesters march during a silent demonstration against the results of the 2009 @entity3 presidential election in central @entity81			1
dissidents used the internet to garner support blocked : an announcement on state television revealed filters on @entity21 and @entity33 in @entity3 ' until further notice ' @entity89 , deputy communications and technology minister , said : ' in recent days , all governmental agencies and offices ... have been connected to the national information network			1
' he added that the second phase of the plan would be to connect ordinary @entity3 to the national network			1
according to @entity3 media , the domestic system would be fully implemented by march 2013 but it was not clear whether access to the global @entity102 would be cut once the @entity3 system is rolled out			1
anti-government protests took place after the disputed re-election of president @entity64 ( pictured ) even using vpns , many @entity3 suffered serious problems accessing email and social networking sites in february , ahead of parliamentary elections			1
cyber security was tightened by the @entity113 after its nuclear programme was attacked in 2010 by the @entity116 computer worm , which caused centrifuges to fail at its main uranium enrichment facility			2
@entity81 , whose nuclear programme is suspected by the @entity121 of being aimed at developing a bomb , accused the @entity123 and @entity124 of deploying the worm			0
in april , authorities claimed a computer virus was detected inside the control systems of @entity129 - which handles the vast majority of @entity3 's crude oil exports - but the terminal remained operational			1
last month @entity133 , @entity3 's communications and technology minister , said @entity3 needed to develop its own network to ensure the safety of the country 's information			1
he added : ' control over the internet should not be in the hands of one or two countries			0
especially on major issues and during crises , one can not trust this network at all			0
' in may , @entity3 threatened to take legal action against @entity21 over its decision to drop the term ' @entity149 ' from its @entity150 and leaving the waterway between @entity3 and the @entity152 nameless			2
many @entity154 states refer to the sea as the ' @entity149 ' , a term @entity3 considers unacceptable			2
@entity3 is no stranger to internet censorship			2
in a country known for the oppression of its own people , fears over this latest move are , perhaps , unsurprising			2
earlier this year internet links were mysteriously cut - leaving millions without email and social network access - as rumours of planned anti-government protests circulated			2
@entity33 , @entity21 and @entity169 were all thought to have been restricted and users were locked out of their online banking accounts			0
for dissidents opposing the @entity113 's leadership , the internet has become one of the most powerful communication tools at their disposal			0
demonstrations have been orchestrated using blogs and social networks to gather support and increase numbers			0
shocking : millions saw @entity184 die in @entity81 after footage was uploaded to @entity41 but , perhaps more importantly , the web has also been a crucial outlet for citizens to expose their oppression to the outside world			0
events that would have otherwise been shielded from @entity193 eyes have been revealed to the international community , much to the anger of the government			0
at no time has this been more obvious than during demonstrations in the wake of the 2009 elections , when thousands took to the streets to protest against the disputed victory of @entity3 president @entity64			2
as @entity3 played down events to outsiders , dissidents used @entity26 , @entity60 and @entity41 to tell the world what was really happening			2
the most shocking example of this was the death of music student @entity184 , whose murder at the hands of a government militiaman was captured on a camera phone and uploaded to @entity41 in 2009			0
millions watched horrific footage of the 26 - year - old , who had been taking part in a peaceful protest in @entity81 , as she was shot through the heart by a sniper and died minutes later in a pool of blood .			0

officials claim filtered access to the web will protect @entity3 from cyber attacks
many @entity3 fear it is the latest tactic to restrict online information
