by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 13 december 2012 it was a simple case of pressing a button			0
but he probably would n’t be the first among us to be a little perplexed by a touchscreen			0
pope @entity7 looked as though he was struggling to get to grips with his @entity9 as he posted his first @entity10 update yesterday			1
but after a little bit of not - so - divine intervention , the 85 - year - old pontiff successfully hit send – and appeared rather delighted with the result			2
thank you for your generous response			0
i bless all of you from my heart			0
’ pope @entity7 posted the message at the end of his weekly general audience this morning			1
as well as going out to his followers on @entity10 , the 140 - character message also flashed on the large screens in the modernist pope @entity40 where the audience was held			1
at around the same time the message was sent , the account 's followers surpassed the 1 million mark on the eight languages of the handle , adding some 11,000 followers in the last two hours alone			1
today is the feast of the @entity51 and the 85 - year - old pontiff has said he will respond to three messages sent to him from around the world using the hashtag # askpontifex , the @entity49 said			2
after his initial tweet , the @entity7 seemed to post a question - possibly one sent in to him - and an answer to it			1
new technology : pope @entity7 being shown his first twitter message during his weekly general audience new age : after being shown the ropes , pope @entity7 clicks on a tablet to send his first twitter message his tweets read : ' any suggestions on how to be more prayerful when we are so busy with the demands of work , families and the world ? ' offer everything you do to the @entity72 , ask his help in all the circumstances of daily life and remember that he is always beside you '			1
the first papal tweet has been the subject of intense curiosity for months			0
pope @entity7 actually sent his very first tweet over a year ago , using a generic @entity49 account to launch the @entity49 's news information portal			1
is anything happening ? the pontiff waits for confirmation that his first @entity10 update has worked successful social networking : as the tweet is published , pope @entity7 appears delighted someone in his name tweeted daily during @entity91 , part of the @entity49 's efforts to increase the church presence in social media			1
a personal @entity10 account has been the subject of speculation ever since the @entity49 's senior communications official said in february the idea was gaining traction			2
@entity49 officials have acknowledged the pope wo n't actually type the messages and that someone in the @entity49 's secretariat of state will write them on his behalf			0
but they have insisted that the words will be his alone , culled from his speeches , homilies or catechism lessons			0
blessing : pope @entity7 blesses faithful during his weekly general audience at the @entity40 hall at the @entity49 as incongruous as it may seem for the 85 - year - old @entity7 to be on @entity10 , @entity113 officials have stressed that he is merely walking in the footsteps of his predecessors in using the latest in communications technology to spread the faith			1
pope @entity120 , for example , caused a similar stir when he launched @entity122 some 80 years ago to bring the pope 's message on radio waves around the globe			2
the @entity49 also has its own newspaper , television service and maintains dedicated @entity130 channels and an internet news portal			0
although pope @entity7 sent today 's first tweet himself , in the future most will be written by aides and he will sign them off before they are sent			1
the tweets will be going out in @entity144 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity136			0
other languages will be added in the future			0
@entity147 , senior media advisor to the @entity49 said the @entity10 handle @ @entity148 is appropriate for a number of reasons			0
' the handle is a good one			0
it means " pope " and it also means " bridge builder " , ' he said			0
' the @entity7 wants to reach out to everyone			2
' we are going to get a spiritual message			0
the @entity7 is not going to be walking around with a @entity159 or an @entity9 and no one is going to be putting words into the @entity7 's mouth			1
' he will tweet what he wants to tweet , ' @entity147 said			0
primarily the tweets will come from the contents of his weekly general audience , sunday blessings and homilies on major @entity171 holidays			1
they will also include reaction to major world events , such as natural disasters			0
but while the @entity7 will be one of the world 's most high - profile tweeters and have many followers , he will not be following anyone himself			1
the @entity7 's @entity10 page is designed in yellow and white - the colours of the @entity49 , with a backdrop of the @entity49 and his picture			1
livery : the official account features @entity49 livery and images of the city state , as well as the @entity7 's signature it may change during different liturgical seasons of the year and when he is away from the @entity113 on trips			1
the @entity49 said precautions had been taken to make sure the @entity7 's certified account is not hacked			1
only one computer in the @entity49 's secretariat of state will be used for the tweets			0
pope @entity7 blessed the possibilities of social media last year but warned it may lead to isolation			1
' the @entity7 's presence on @entity10 is a concrete expression of his conviction that the @entity171 must be present in the digital arena , ' the @entity49 said			2
' this initiative is best understood in the context of his reflections on the importance of the cultural space that has been brought into being by the new technologies ... the @entity7 's presence on @entity10 can be seen as the ' tip of the iceberg ' that is the @entity171 's presence in the world of new media , ' it said in a statement			2
mass : pope @entity7 sits by a crib during his weekly general audience this morning the @entity7 , who still writes his speeches and books by hand , has given a qualified blessing to social networking			1
in a document issued last year , he said the possibilities of new media and social networks offered ' a great opportunity ' , but warned of the risks of depersonalisation , alienation , self - indulgence , and the dangers of having more virtual friends than real ones			0
the @entity49 decided against using a personal @entity237 page for the pope because they thought it was too personal an interaction and would require more manpower to keep updated			2
in 2009 , a new @entity49 website , www.pope2you.net , went live , offering an application called ' the @entity7 meets you on @entity237 " , and another allowing the faithful to see the pontiff 's speeches and messages on their iphones or ipods			2
the @entity49 famously got egg on its face in 2009 when it was forced to admit that , if it had surfed the web more , it might have known that a traditionalist bishop whose excommunication was lifted had for years been a @entity257 denier			0

pope @entity7 used an @entity9 to post first tweet from personal account
