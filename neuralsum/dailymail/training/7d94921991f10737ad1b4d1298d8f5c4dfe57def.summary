the ocean floor is home to many weird and terrifying predators , many of which could discourage anyone from ever setting foot into the sea again			1
this creature is @entity9 - also known as the @entity11 worm , apparently after an underwater photographer decided two decades ago that its hunting methods were similar to the @entity15 family incident of 1993			1
that incident involved @entity15 slicing nearly half her husband 's member off			1
@entity19 is similar , according to a 2011 paper in @entity21 , ' because either the widely open jaw pieces resemble scissors , or because the exposed portion resembles an erect penis			1
' can literally slice its prey in two : the iridescent @entity28 aphroditois - nicknamed the ' bobbit worm ' - that snares prey between two sharp mandibles which snap shut like scissors the nickname is inaccurate - mrs @entity15 inflicted the grievous injury on her husband using a knife rather than scissors - but it has stuck nevertheless			1
and it is perhaps a close enough comparison to dissuade any man from skinny dipping in warm waters near the sea floor at depths of 30 to 130ft , where the long - living nocturnal worm is generally found			1
the creature , which spends its life mostly buried beneath the sand of the sea - floor , sticks just a portion of its body up into the water where it has five antennae to sense its prey , usually smaller worms and fish			1
mammoth : a scientists poses with the 10ft - long @entity61 discovered in @entity63 's @entity62 in 2009 it snares its prey using a complex feeding apparatus called a pharynx which can turn inside - out , like the fingers of a glove , and has sharp mandibles on the end which snap shut like scissors			1
unlucky creatures are sometimes sliced in two because of the speed and strength of the worm 's attacks , and it can dish out nasty bites to any humans who stray too close			1
one the prey is caught , the worm shoots back into its burrow to feed			1
when prey is scarce it also feeds seaweed and other sea plants , and will scavenge for morsels around the surface of its burrow			1
noted for its unusually large body size and length , @entity19 is found in warm waters all over the world			1
since the 19th century , marine biologists have recognised it has having one of the longest bodies among polychaetes - a class of segmented , mostly marine worms			2
they average a length of about one metre , but specimens measuring as long as three metres have been discovered			2
a white whale which learnt to imitate the voices of humans may have been trying to make contact , scientists believe			2
the male named @entity111 had a distinctly human - like voice , much to the surprise of scientists who previously thought whales typically produce sounds in a manner that is wholly different from humans			2
@entity111 died five years ago after 30 years of living amongst dolphins and other white whales and being in contact with humans at the @entity122 based in @entity123 in @entity124			1
however , the incredible recordings of the whale were revealed for the first time as the team published their findings			2
@entity130 , who led the study , said : ' our observations suggest that the whale had to modify its vocal mechanics in order to make the speech - like sounds			2
such obvious effort suggests motivation for contact			0
' a report by @entity142 , assistant director of the @entity143 in @entity63 , describes one such mammoth worm found hiding in one of the floats of a mooring raft in @entity63 's @entity149 in 2009			0
' [ @entity151 ] it is uncertain when the individual first entered the mooring raft and fish corral during the 13 years the structure sat in the harbour , ' he writes			0
' it is also uncertain whether the worm arrived by larval settlement or at a semi-adult stage of development			0
nonetheless , the individual surely had been living in its comfortable floating home for a quite a long time			0
' at 9ft 10in long , about a pound in weight and with 673 segments , the worm they discovered was one of the largest specimens of @entity173 aphroditois ever found			0
that same year , a report in @entity175 detailed how a 4ft - long specimen was unearthed in a @entity179 , @entity178 aquarium that was attacking coral and prize fish			0
workers at the attraction had been left scratching their heads as to why the coral had been left devastated and - in some cases - cut in half			0
after staking out the display for several weeks , the last resort was to completely dismantle it , rock by rock			0
@entity192 , the aquarium 's curator , said : ' something was guzzling our reef but we had no idea what , we also found an injured @entity199 so we laid traps but they got ripped apart in the night			0
' that worm must have obliterated the traps			0
the bait was full of hooks which he must have just digested			0
' staff believe the beast - which they nicknamed @entity209 - arrived by hitching a ride into the aquarium hiding inside a piece of coral when it was young and grew enormous over a number of years			0
mr @entity192 added : ' it really does look like something out of a horror movie			0

@entity9 apparently given the nickname by an underwater photographer two decades ago
it snares its prey using a complex feeding apparatus with two sharp mandibles which snap shut like a pair of scissors
