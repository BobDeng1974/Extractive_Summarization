the hostility @entity1 suffered for wanting to play rugby as a teenager was made to look even more absurd when she sealed @entity6 ’s @entity5 triumph last sunday with a superb individual try			1
like the rest of her team - mates , @entity1 is only too aware of the cliches surrounding women ’s rugby			1
‘ leave it to the men , ’ the dinosaurs say			2
‘ the rugby field is no place for girls ’			1
the excellence of @entity1 and her team - mates is helping to change perceptions of a sport that has seen participation levels more than double in the past 10 years			1
it is , in business terms , a growth industry			0
‘ we ’re aware of the stereotypes and the view that rugby is a “ man ’s game ” and it ’s a view we are working so hard to break down , ’ the 24 - year - old said at the clubhouse of her former club , @entity49			1
‘ those attitudes do n’t annoy me because it creates more of a challenge to break them down			0
it ’s a challenge to say , “ we ’re going to change your mind ”			0
a lot of the people who think women should n’t play rugby have never watched it			2
i would urge them to watch a game			0
if they are real rugby fans , they ’ll appreciate it			2
’ girl power : @entity6 's success has started to change the perception of women 's rugby it is hard to argue			1
@entity6 ’s 21 - 9 victory over @entity27 , in which @entity1 contributed 16 points , was the last of 30 matches in a compelling three - week competition in @entity79 which emphasised the quality and excitement of the sport			1
@entity1 ’s successful goal - kicking percentage of 79 success was much better than @entity86 ’s in his last @entity5			1
an average player weighs about three stones less than a professional male player and that athleticism , linked to an attacking mentality , means there is a view that women ’s rugby is better to watch			1
@entity1 grew up on her parents ’ farm in @entity98 unaware of stereotypes			1
‘ i was five when i started playing , ’ she said			0
‘ my brother , @entity100 , is three years older and my dad took him down to @entity49 when he was about eight			0
i went along with no intention of playing , just for something to do on a sunday morning			0
‘ a coach asked if i wanted to have a little pass around			0
i had a run around and was pretty much hooked from that point on			0
’ best foot forward : @entity1 's goal kicking was more accurate than @entity86 's @entity1 , a rangy inside centre who is ‘ 5ft 11¼in — and do n’t round it up ’ , played alongside boys until she was 12 before switching to a girls ’ team			1
but as a teenager she realised she was breaking the mould — and she was strong enough to ignore the barbs			0
‘ i did encounter hostility towards me playing , ’ she said			2
‘ i had a very sheltered life growing up on a farm but when i went to college i came across kids who had led much more of a city life who had grown up in a very different way			0
‘ i do n’t want it to sound like a big bullying thing but i definitely encountered hostility			2
it was just people not understanding why you were able to play rugby or why you would even want to			2
especially at that age when it ’s more about what you look like , what your boyfriend ’s called , how much make - up you ’re wearing			2
‘ i was still interested in all that , but it was n’t my main focus , which it is for a lot of girls			0
i loved playing sport , especially rugby			1
’ @entity148 skinned : the @entity6 centre admits she received some hostility as a woman rugby player with growing interest from tv audiences , which peaked at just over 2 million for a final shown in 137 countries , it appears to be a matter of time before enough investment is available to enable @entity161 and her team - mates to turn fully professional			1
the @entity6 squad , coached by @entity164 , self - fund much of their season with many of them returning to their ‘ proper ’ jobs within 48 hours of winning the final in @entity171			1
@entity1 , a pe teacher at @entity172 in @entity173 , tells one story of a match last season between her club , @entity178 , and a @entity180 side featuring @entity6 prop and vet @entity181 , who missed the first 60 minutes after receiving a call - out just before kick - off to deliver a calf			1
@entity186 worry that by turning professional , women ’s rugby could fall into the same trap as the men by placing an emphasis on brawn and power over skill and artistry ? ‘ you need to be strong for rugby , but the fact we ’re women does mean we do n’t have the capacity to get so big and personally , i ’d never want to get like that , ’ she said			2
‘ i still want to look pretty in a dress ! for other girls that ’s important , too			0
i ’m still able to do the job i can do looking like i do despite getting grief from the other girls for being puny			0
’ feminine side : @entity1 receives the @entity6 women 's @entity210 award in 2013 for now , all @entity1 really wants to do is savour @entity5 glory			1
‘ you waver occasionally and wonder if all the effort is worth it but at moments like this it ’s possible to step back and say , “ look what i ’ve achieved , look what that hard work and effort have done ”			0
