@entity0 will contribute £ 1bn to @entity2 bailout by @entity3 and @entity4 last updated at 2:03 am on 25th june 2011 the @entity8 debt crisis is the greatest threat to the faltering economic recovery , the governor of the @entity6 warned yesterday			1
as the turmoil spread to @entity13 , sir @entity11 said @entity0 would be at risk if a crisis of confidence over the euro spread ‘ contagion ’ to other countries			1
he also warned that handing the bankrupt @entity2 government another bailout would do nothing to solve the ‘ mess ’			1
experts : the impact of the crisis nations such as @entity26 and @entity27 will have a knock - on effect on the @entity0 and lead to a tightening of bank funding conditions @entity31 has claimed he has won a landmark victory in @entity33 by preventing the @entity0 being dragged into a new handout for @entity35			1
but sir @entity11 warned : ‘ the most serious and immediate risk to the @entity0 financial system stems from the worsening sovereign debt crisis in several euro area countries			1
experience has shown that contagion can spread through banking markets			2
’ last night those fears appeared to be partially justified when credit rating agency @entity45 threatened to downgrade the credit worthiness of 16 @entity13 banks and two government - backed financial institutions			2
warning : the @entity6 's financial watchdog warned the eurozone 's debt crisis poses the biggest single threat to @entity0 financial stability the analysts also said the outlook for 13 more @entity13 banks has slipped from stable to negative because of low growth and @entity13 government debts which are 120 per cent of national income			1
@entity45 ’s has already threatened to downgrade the @entity13 government ’s credit rating and yesterday ’s move sent bank share prices lower			2
sir @entity11 said uncertainty over exposure to countries such as @entity2 could lead to a " crisis of confidence " the threat to @entity13 sparked fears that @entity72 will also go under , since bigger countries are more likely to drag @entity8 into a new depression than the debt problems in @entity2 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
in a rebuke to @entity81 leaders , sir @entity11 warned that heaping yet more debt on to @entity2 wo n’t alleviate the deep - seated problems caused by the country living beyond its means			1
the governor said : ‘ simply the belief that we just lend a bit more will never be an answer			2
an awful lot of people wanted to believe that this was a crisis of liquidity			2
' it was n’t , it is n’t			0
until we accept that , we will never find an answer to it			0
’ he called on @entity0 banks to keep more assets to help them ride out the crisis , pointing out that while they have relatively modest exposures to @entity2 debt , they are ‘ quite heavily exposed ’ to @entity27 and @entity26 banks , which are themselves party to the @entity2 problems			1
sir @entity11 ’s comments came as mr @entity31 forced @entity26 chancellor @entity111 to abandon an attempt to make @entity0 taxpayers help to prop up @entity2			1
the new @entity2 bailout will be funded by the eurozone and the @entity116 rather than all @entity81 nations			1
former prime minister @entity118 the @entity8 single currency will survive its present crisis despite ' fundamental ' problems - and the @entity0 could still join in the future , ex-prime minister @entity118 said			1
mr @entity118 rejected claims by former @entity125 cabinet colleague @entity124 that the euro was doomed to collapse though he conceded the case for @entity0 entry was not ' compelling '			1
but he told the @entity129 that he remained ' absolutely in favour of doing it , politically ' if the economic circumstances meant the idea could be sold to voters			2
in an interview for the @entity136 he said he had fully supported then chancellor @entity137 ’s assessment - using five tests - that the @entity0 should not enter			1
but asked if that decision was a relief given the present eurozone chaos , he said : ' i do not take the view some people take that @entity0 joining the euro in the past or now would be a disaster			1
' but i always said that unless you could make a compelling case for it economically , you were never going to win a referendum			0
' the case for @entity0 joining is not compelling			1
it may become that at a certain point			0
' he went on : ' i was always absolutely in favour of doing it politically and still am , by the way			0
' mr @entity124 suggested last week that the euro could not survive and called for a speedy demise rather than a ' slow death '			0
' i do n’t think it will ( collapse ) actually , ' mr @entity118 said in the interview , which will be broadcast on sunday			0
' i do n’t think they are going to give up the single currency			0
that ’s not to say there are n’t huge issues as to how you get through the next months			0
' i think and hope the single currency will resolve its problems			0
' prime minister @entity31 said : ' it would be a dreadful idea for @entity0 to join the euro			1
' as long as i am doing this job , there is no prospect of @entity0 even contemplating joining			1
' @entity0 ’s contribution will amount to around £ 1billion through the @entity116			1
it would have been more than double that if mr @entity31 had not got his way			0
the prime minister said : ‘ @entity0 did not contribute to the first @entity2 bailout			1
we were not involved in the discussions about it			0
we are not in the eurozone			0
‘ as a result , it would be wrong to be drawn into the @entity8 element of a future payment			0
i sought assurances on that			0
i got assurances on that			0
that ’s important for @entity0			2
‘ we want the eurozone to sort out its problems and its difficulties and we ’ve been constructive in trying to make that happen			0
’ flashpoint : the @entity2 government 's austerity measures have been met with violent protests the prime minister said he agreed with the governor on the need for @entity8 banks to carry more capital			1
but critics called on the government to take a leadership role in the @entity81 to ensure that @entity0 ’s @entity8 partners get their economic houses in order			2
@entity216 , of think - tank @entity214 , said : ‘ the government gives the impression that it ’s happy standing on the side - lines of negotiations to deal with the crisis ... but the @entity0 must now push for a long - term solution			2
’ meanwhile , @entity118 says he still wants @entity0 to join the euro – when the time is right			2
in an interview with the @entity129 to be broadcast tomorrow , the former prime minister says : ‘ i was always absolutely in favour of doing it politically and still am , by the way			0
’ riot act : @entity31 insisted @entity0 would bail out @entity2			1
he said @entity2 prime minister @entity230 , right , was ' taking great steps forward ' @entity31 accused @entity81 leaders of wanting to live in a ‘ gilded cage ’ yesterday after @entity33 bosses raised two fingers to austerity by laying out plans for a lavish new headquarters costing £ 280million			1
the prime minister and other @entity81 leaders were presented with an expensive brochure about the building as they were discussing the need for austerity at a summit dinner on thursday night			0
computer generated images show a womb - like glass structure , dubbed the ‘ @entity249 ’ , and an enormous circular summit chamber resembling the war room in the film dr @entity253			0
mr @entity31 told @entity254 they ‘ just do n’t get ’ the need for austerity after it emerged that the @entity257 was spending £ 100,000 of taxpayers ’ money on the 16 - page pamphlet alone			2
it features @entity263 - gobbledygook saying the building – expected to be in use by 2014 – will be ‘ a patchwork of @entity8 diversity			0
housing the heart of @entity8 ’ , with achingly right - on areas such as ‘ humane gathering places ’			0
mr @entity31 said there was no need for a new summit building and expressed disgust that @entity81 officials were wasting money promoting their own ‘ grandiose schemes ’ rather than tackling @entity8 ’s economic woes			0
‘ it ’s important , whether it ’s at the national level or the @entity8 level , that politicians are n’t sitting in some gilded cage , ’ he added .			0
