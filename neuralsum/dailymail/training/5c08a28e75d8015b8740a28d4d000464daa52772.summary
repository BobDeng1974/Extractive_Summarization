one hand clinging to his boat 's gunwale , @entity0 submerges himself , eyes and ears wide open underwater as he ‘ listens ’ for fish sounds emanating from the blue depths			1
mr @entity0 is one of @entity10 's last ‘ fish listeners , ’ and he and his apprentice son @entity11 are believed to be the only active practitioners of this mysterious and dying local art. ‘ when you listen , it is like through a looking glass - you can see mackerel , sardine , ’ said mr @entity0 , 68 , who has fished the @entity15 lagoons on @entity10 's rural east coast his whole life			1
reel mysterious : fish listener @entity0 clings onto his fishing boat at sea near the @entity15 lagoons off the east coast of @entity10 dying art : other fish listeners have passed away , retired or turned to modern fish - detection technology ‘ for us , we only look for @entity30 ( a type of croaker )			1
but in the schools of gelama , there will be other fish			2
the gelama is the king of fish			2
’ other fish listeners have passed away , retired or turned to modern fish - detection technology as the traditional practice has retreated in the face of dwindling catches and proliferating undersea noise			1
studies show @entity10 waters lost 92 per cent of fishery resources between 1971 and 2007 due to overfishing			1
‘ you ca n't copy our technique			0
you must gain the skill and learn the lay of the waters , ’ said mr @entity0			1
distinct : mr @entity0 says that all fish have ' a voice ' ‘ the wholesalers tell me “ if you 're gone , there will be no more gelama ” , which fetches up to 10 times the price of similarly sized fish			1
‘ @entity65 ’ , as he is known locally - ‘ @entity66 ’ is a @entity63 honorific similar to ‘ @entity64 ’ - finds it hard to describe exactly how fish sound , but likens it to pebbles being dropped into water			1
‘ they have a voice			0
this sound is this fish , that sound is another			1
when someone is new , they ca n't tell one fish song from another			0
’ mr @entity0 and his crew of a dozen can go nearly a week without hearing gelama - which invites scepticism about the claimed fish - listening ability			1
but experts in @entity88 ( fish sounds ) say sailors have long heard sounds of whales and fish through boat hulls			1
hunting : mr @entity0 mainly hunts for schools of gelama dedicated : mr @entity0 has fished the @entity15 lagoons on @entity10 's rural east coast his whole life ‘ @entity102 divers often do not hear anything because their breathing and bubble exhaust makes so much noise			1
however free divers , or divers using quiet re-breathers , can hear much better , ’ said @entity100 - based marine ecologist @entity99			0
former fish listeners describe a range of techniques			1
some claim they can feel changes in water temperature			0
for mr @entity0 , it is a multi-sensory experience requiring eyes wide open			1
‘ after a while , it is as if you can see			0
even though the fish is very far , you can sense it in that direction and you go there			0
only when you get close , you can hear the fish clearly , ’ he said			0
though he sports a slight paunch on his sun - darkened frame under a spiky white head of hair , mr @entity0 remains sprightly despite his years , deftly clambering in and out of his boat in search of fish sounds			1
once he pinpoints a school of gelama , his crew - who have hung back with engines off - motor forward , drop their nets and strike the sides of their boats to spook the fish into the mesh trap			1
‘ you think it 's just stupid fish but they can see you coming			0
when they hear the sound of the boat , they run			0
the fish cry or shout and then their friends swim away , ’ he said			0
landing a rich catch was easy when stocks were abundant , mr @entity0 said			2
but after decades of overfishing , he now ‘ listens ’ up to several dozen times under the scorching equatorial sun before catching a snippet of gelama song			0
modernisation , including sand dredging , aquaculture , factories and fishing trawlers has transformed the @entity15 wetlands , a rich but threatened coastal ecosystem centering on a nine - mile ( 14 - kilometre ) long lagoon along the @entity169			0
the state of @entity171 is seeking to make it a protected park			0
now mr @entity0 's catch is increasingly unpredictable , averaging about $ 2,000 per week gross , leaving little left over after all crew are paid , and fuel , maintenance , and other costs are deducted			1
‘ each year , the catch has reduced			0
but i 'm not good at anything else , so i still have to do this , ’ said his son and apprentice @entity11			2
@entity10 ranks among the top consumers of seafood in the world			2
intergovernmental industry researchers infofish say @entity10 eat an average of 56.5 kilogrammes of seafood per person annually , more even than @entity190			2
the global average is 20 kilos			0
@entity193 - @entity10 chief @entity192 said overfishing threatens to leave @entity10 waters ‘ vast and barren ’			2
the organisation warns @entity10 's waters could run out of seafood by 2048			2
despite the long odds , @entity11 , 44 , said someday he will train one of his own sons			0
‘ i do n't want to see this practice die off , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 ' listens ' for fish sounds emanating from the depths
he and his apprentice son in @entity10 are the last remaining ' fish listeners '
he likens the sound of the fish to that of pebbles being dropped into water
@entity0 uses his art to pinpoint where his crew should cast their nets
