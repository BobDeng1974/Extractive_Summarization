by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 15 march 2013 it 's only 27 days into @entity2 but today is when many @entity3 will give in to temptation and indulge themselves in the guilty pleasure they promised to sacrifice for 40 days			1
a survey carried out by supermarket chain @entity7 of 2,000 shoppers found that 34 per cent will end their abstinence today			2
the majority of respondents ( 41 per cent ) cited a bad week at work as the main reason for succumbing to temptation followed by peer pressure from friends and family who are n't giving anything up ( 35 per cent )			1
giving in : those who gave up coffee and social networking for @entity2 were most likely to cave in first for a fifth , the thought that they had almost lasted a month was enough to make them feel less guilty about giving up before the end of @entity2			1
chocolate is a common sacrifice at @entity2 but many ca n't go the full 40 days without it regardless of religious inclination , three quarters of @entity3 still use @entity2 as an opportunity to give up bad habits			1
the most common things to forgo for the 40 - day period were food - related or social networks			2
carbs ( 19 per cent ) was the most popular food type to avoid followed by chocolate ( 16 per cent )			0
more people said they would give up @entity41 ( 17 per cent ) than @entity42 ( 12 per cent ) while avoiding swearing also made the top five sacrifices			0
it seems what you decide to give up determines how long you 'll last			0
those who gave up coffee and social networking sites were more likely to fail sooner than those who gave up carbs and chocolate - perhaps because the latter were able to see almost immediate results from their sacrifices			1
@entity7 nutritionist @entity57 said : ' giving up anything entirely for a long period of time can be tough , so it ’s easy to see why people crack before the 40 days is up			0
' it ’s interesting to see that those who gave up sugary or fatty foods were most likely to stick to it ; probably because of the obvious health benefits associated with a reduced calorie diet , such as weight loss			0
' the thought of devouring a delicious chocolate easter egg as a reward at the end of it probably helps too ! ' @entity2 begins on @entity75 and ends at @entity76 and is a @entity78 tradition marking the @entity80 story of when @entity81 when into the desert and was tempted by the devil .			0

on the 27th day of @entity2 , 34 per cent will indulge in what they vowed to sacrifice
nearly half blame their lack of self - *discipline* on ' a bad week at work '
those who gave up coffee and social networking were the most likely to give in first
