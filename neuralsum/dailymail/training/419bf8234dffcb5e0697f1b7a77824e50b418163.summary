human remains are still lying around the @entity4 crash site nine days after the tragedy and are exposed to the ' ravages of the @entity8 summer and animals , ' @entity1 prime minister @entity0 said			1
addressing media on saturday , mr @entity0 - referring to information he had received from @entity1 teams who have arrived in @entity14 - said the presence of ' unrecovered remains ' at the site highlights the urgent need for an international force to secure the area			1
local villagers are some of the people seen rifling through the wreckage , which stretches across kilometres of farming villages			1
@entity1 has sent 230 - strong team , comprising 190 federal police and defence personnel - including medical specialists , to @entity8 but they have had to remain in @entity29 until permission is given for them to enter eastern @entity14 to assist with the recovery operation			1
the nation 's officials had gained access to the site on friday , but mr @entity0 added : ' plainly , there are unrecovered bodies remaining in the area			1
' ' it 's the presence of unrecovered remains that makes it more important than ever that an international team be dispatched to the site to recover remains , to assist investigations and to obtain justice ... for the victims and their loved ones			1
it is one of many to have been rifled through at the crash site since the plane came down on july 17 permission from @entity14 's parliament for armed @entity1 personnel to enter the site should be secured next week			1
mr @entity0 said it was not unusual for armed representatives to be involved			1
' when you 've got a major humanitarian effort as we have , it 's normal and natural to have [ @entity83 ] assistance , ' he said			0
the presence of armed personnel should not compound the @entity4 tragedy but the recovery and investigation effort needed to move swiftly and those involved should not be in danger , mr @entity0 said			1
' we do want to get this done as quickly as we humanly can and that 's why we 're exploring all options			0
' special envoy air chief marshal @entity93 said the armed personnel would be protecting the experts at the crash site , and were working with the @entity14 parliament to ratify the arrangement			1
' we welcome acting prime minister @entity99 ’s comments on 25 july that he hopes the @entity100 [ @entity100 ] can adopt the arrangement next week , ' he said			1
' the president , government and parliament of @entity14 are working together to get the arrangement ratified			1
' @entity1 understands that this is a politically challenging time for @entity14 , and we greatly appreciate the assistance and cooperation received from president @entity109 , acting prime minister @entity99 , foreign minister @entity111 , and other @entity14 officials			1
' distressing : one woman breaks down in tears as she looks at the debris from @entity4 which landed in a field of sunflowers in @entity118 , eastern @entity14 painstaking : @entity120 experts check debris at the main crash site of the @entity124 flight which came down in a remote war - torn corner of @entity14 assessment : forensic experts have spent days at the crash site , near the village of @entity131 , to carry out investigations and attempt to locate the plane 's black boxes an @entity1 squadron leader who is one of the pilots flying remains of victims to the @entity139 on a c - 17 aircraft told the @entity141 that it was a ' big ' and ' very sad task '			1
@entity144 squadron leader @entity143 told the national broadcaster that flying from @entity146 to the @entity14 took three hours			1
then cargo and human remains were loaded up and the aircraft returned to @entity150 , where a ' ramp ceremony ' - respectfully removing the remains from the aircraft in coffins - was conducted			2
' it 's a big task			0
it 's a very sad task			0
but all the folks deployed over here take great pride in taking part in it and just being able to help out with getting the people back to their families			2
' squadron leader @entity143 said the most challenging moment had probably been meeting the families after a ceremony at @entity150			2
' that 's been certainly quite a touching moment , ' he said			0
' they are thankful for what we are doing here			0
' they 're obviously going through untold grief but their only real response has been thankful that we 're here			0
' tragic : a toy teddy bear placed at the crash site of @entity179 17 , near the village of @entity181 , eastern @entity14 , shows a mark of respect to the victims wreckage : the @entity124 flight was carrying 298 passengers when it came down over eastern @entity14 on july 17 tragic : one resident surveys the damage of @entity4 which was travelling from @entity189 to @entity190 when it came down over eastern @entity14 , killing all on board it has been nine days since the @entity124 jet was shot down over a remote war - torn corner of eastern @entity14			1
but as world leaders prevaricate over their response to an act of mass murder , the disgraceful failure to recover all 298 victims of flight @entity4 was all too evident yesterday			2
three generations of one @entity14 family could be seen picking their way through the wreckage like people inspecting the aftermath of a storm			1
many bodies are still lost in the fields of sunflowers that surround the area – and could remain until the 1.5m high crops are harvested next month			1
but it is the inescapable stench of rotting flesh in 30c heat that is so distressing – at a site controlled by the same heavily armed @entity220 rebels accused of destroying the @entity124 with a missile			1
it can only be guessed what the families of those who lost their lives on the flight from @entity189 to @entity190 must make of it all			2
although the repatriation flights have begun , just 200 bodies and an unspecified number of body parts have so far been sent to the @entity139 for identification			2
almost a third of the 298 killed – who included ten @entity236 – could still be missing and may never be found			2
the band of inexperienced kalashnikov - wielding recruits in charge in this corner of @entity14 has refused access to international forensic experts			1
as a result , the crash scene – which stretches for kilometres across the farming villages of @entity245 , @entity131 and @entity246 – remains in a state of ugly chaos			2
persistent looting means vital evidence – and sentimental keepsakes – have been lost			0
parts of the plane have been stolen to be sold as scrap			2
giant pieces of fuselage are strewn for miles , along with twisted burnt metal , suitcases and clothing			0
parts of the doomed jet ’s cockpit lie surrounded by personal possessions that have clearly been tampered with or stolen from			0
wallets – emptied of cash – lie next to children ’s shoes and toys			0
a baby ’s bottle rests by a pile of opened letters			0
nearby , a collection of classical music is scattered across the charred ground			0
also still visible are the remains of animals and birds from the jet ’s hold , including pigeons , two dogs , peacocks and parrots			1
respect : funeral hearses carrying the first 40 victims of @entity4 arrived at the @entity293 van @entity291 barracks in @entity294 , @entity139 on thursday tributes : hundreds of flowers and tributes were laid n @entity150 , @entity139 , as several of the bodies of the @entity4 victims were transported back to the country some locals have begun to light candles around the debris and to lay teddy bears in memory of the 80 children who died			2
retired miner @entity308 , 57 , who lives yards from the crashed cockpit , said many bodies are still hidden in the sunflowers as temperatures soar			2
the father of two , one of 200 volunteers told by the rebels to search for bodies , said : ‘ you can smell them everywhere			2
there are also wild dogs here			0
the bodies will not last much longer			0
we need international forces to help search the site properly before it is too late			0
‘ the bodies are in the fields but you can not see them for the sunflowers			0
we do not harvest until the end of august so unless someone comes to help , they will not be uncovered until then			0
’ tears streaming down his face , mr @entity308 added : ‘ i saw many dead children here by my house			0
i bring flowers and light candles as respect for them			0
’ grieving relatives have told of how credit cards and mobile phones belonging to victims have been used since the crash			0
the @entity350 yesterday said it will work with relatives to help protect against fraud			0
the crash investigation is being led by a @entity139 team as 194 of those killed were from the @entity139			2
yesterday , a small group was able to visit part of the scene , while a group of 40 @entity139 policemen are reported to be on their way to try to help secure the area			0
some 90 @entity1 military police are on standby in @entity362			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity0 fears some remains will never be recovered unless security is tightened			1
@entity366 ambassador to the @entity14 @entity367 said the crash site is ‘ a giant crime scene and needs to be treated that way			1
’ ‘ further destruction of the wreckage must be stopped			0
it ’s tragic that the site has still not fully been secured , ’ he added .			0
