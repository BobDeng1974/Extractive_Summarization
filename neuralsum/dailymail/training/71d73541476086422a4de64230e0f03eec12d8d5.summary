by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 10:19 est , 25 september 2012 the boyfriend and personal chef of the late @entity4 investor @entity5 are locked in a vicious legal battle over the legendary moneyman 's $ 300 million estate			1
in court papers filed this week in @entity10 , @entity11 , who worked for @entity13 for 18 - years said that the broker 's jealous partner @entity14 had swindled him out of almost $ 4 million that was left to him by @entity13 in his will			1

the court filing says that a 1999 version of the will that @entity13 drew up left $ 4 million to his long - time personal chef who also claims that he was a confidant to the successful investor who counted billionaire @entity69 among his clients			1
however , after @entity13 began dating @entity14 in 2003 , @entity11 claims that the former chief of value investment firm @entity72 changed his will to leave his boyfriend with $ 100 million and reduced his chef 's share to $ 500,000			1
court papers also show that @entity13 was willing to leave his chef with the @entity80 apartment that he had bought for @entity11 and his family			2
it was in 2007 , that the will changed again after @entity13 suffered an accident and a severe head injury			0

but just weeks before @entity13 suffered a fatal heart attack in 2009 , aged 62 , @entity11 was fired and he and his family were ordered to leave the building - the suit alleges that he firing was ' on mr. @entity14 's say - so '			1
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 seen here in 2008 , a year before the investor died ' it ’s a shame that someone so loyal was treated so poorly by someone so rich , ' said @entity11 ’s attorney @entity99 to the @entity100			1

long known as one of the most successful investors on @entity4 , @entity5 was known for buying up stocks that were at rock bottom and waiting for their value to soar before selling			2
succeeding his father as senior partner at the firm @entity115 in 1969 , @entity13 developed the company to the point where it managed more than $ 10 billion in value investments			0
