@entity53 ( @entity52 ) @entity8 , who racked up his 40th pole position in @entity55 , said : ' i think the first lap was quite good			1
none of us have driven this weekend in the wet and the first lap is just the unknown			0
the next one was up at one stage , but generally it was a fantastic job by the team			0
' when you go out in the wet for the first time it is all about adapting to new conditions			0
because there is water on the ground you do n't know which part of the track you 're going to slip out of corners but you 're just trying to test it and feel it and i 've always been pretty good at that			0
' it is going to be a hard race being a bit earlier			0
it is going to be hotter and tougher for the tyres			0
' i 'm happy to see that @entity11 are doing really well and are so close , it shows we do have a race with someone else as well			1
' television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit during @entity94 @entity8 's pole position was his 40th in @entity55 and second in a row to start the 2015 season the @entity99 finished 0.074 seconds ahead of @entity10 in @entity94 with his lap on the intermediate tyres ‘ yes , @entity106 , great , @entity12 50.2 , ’ chimed @entity10 over the radio , having beaten his fellow @entity103 by three - tenths of a second in tough but drying conditions			1
' maybe it is just the track and condtions that went our way but hopefully we can keep that trend tomorrow , ' the four - time world champion told @entity114 after qualifying			1
' i think it has been a bit too chilled for them ( @entity14 ) for the last few months			1
' i think we can win but it depends on a lot of things			0
i think the pace looks decent but we have to be realistic that @entity14 still have an advantage			1
we just have to look after ourselves			0
' @entity12 conceded he simply ' did n't drive well enough '			2
he added : ' i 'm annoyed by that , third place is not good enough			2
' for tomorrow , i 'm on the clean side of the grid so that should help me pass @entity129 at the start			2
' @entity10 's @entity106 finish for @entity11 ended @entity14 ' run of nine straight front - row lockouts @entity12 was annoyed by his @entity135 finish and simply admitted he was not good enough @entity8 set the fastest time with his first lap of the final session , skipping around adroitly on intermediate tyres			1
his calm performance followed the delay caused when rain started to fall two minutes into the second session			2
it was soon bouncing ankle high off the @entity22 track			2
the cars , which had lined up at the end of the pit straight to get on the track to set a time before the rain started , tiptoed back to the garage			2
the times already set stood : @entity8 was only eighth fastest			2
his @entity14 team - mate @entity12 was fastest			1
‘ you guys got me too far behind everyone , man , ’ @entity8 radioed back to his team about not getting to the front of the queue			1
but he had at least scraped through into the final session of qualifying , where he was to show his class in wet conditions			2
@entity29 will join @entity12 on the second row in @entity6 in his @entity30 @entity33 teenager @entity32 qualified for sunday 's race in sixth position @entity10 ’s team - mate @entity41 , who was impeded on the busy track as he tried to set a fast lap , was eliminated early			1
race officials called a hiatus of at least 15 minutes			2
the drivers got out of their car			0
fans had already run for cover from the exposed green banks			2
a restart was then planned for 6.15pm local time – a quarter of an hour after the scheduled end of the session with daylight beginning to fade			0
the @entity180 were out of the reckoning even before the rain started			2
@entity48 had one - tenth of an advantage over his team - mate @entity50 , but they were both eliminated in the first session			1
@entity41 will start 11th on the grid after being eliminated in the second qualifying session dark clouds gather in the background at the @entity191 during the qualifying session ‘ i ca n’t get the tyres working , ’ said @entity48 , who will start 17th			1
an optimistic @entity48 told @entity114 : ' when you get out of the car and you are 17th on the grid you 're disappointed			1
but we 've got to look at our progress and it is a lot of progress			0
we have made massive steps with the engine and are more competitive on the long run			0
it 's still going to be tough tomorrow but we 're making progress			0
@entity50 added : ' it is a tough period at the moment for us but the facts and numbers are much better than @entity209 in terms of pace and we are making progress			2
every race we will improve and we will learn things			0
' @entity50 returned to action in @entity6 following his crash in pre-season testing @entity48 will start 17th on the grid after being eliminated in the first qualifying session @entity50 also struggled in the @entity49 and will begin the race on sunday in 18th place on the grid only the manor cars were below the mclarens on the timing sheets			1
@entity51 was seven seconds off the pace while his team - mate @entity53 did not even put in a lap. a fuel pressure problem was to blame , the latest in a catalogue of problems for the team			2
@entity53 however , will line up at the back of the grid after @entity233 applied successfully to the stewards to let him race on the grounds he ‘ set satisfactory times in practice ’			0
they failed even to get on to the track in @entity240 a fortnight ago and will have only @entity241 representing them in the race here			0
their part - participation in @entity55 is in danger of turning into a prolonged embarrassment .			0
