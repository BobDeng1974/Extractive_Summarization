by @entity0 published : 05:08 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 05:13 est , 26 september 2013 men may believe that whizzing around in an expensive set of wheels is the way to a woman 's heart , but they could n't be more wrong			1
the stereotype that women are turned on by flashy cars is in tatters as new research has shown that , while 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex , women actually labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant , self - centred and dangerous			1
new research aimed to establish whether the type of car you drive actually does influence perceptions - and the results could make you think twice before buying your next car			2
sorry , @entity24 ! women label drivers of sports cars as ' arrogant , self - centred and dangerous ' while men might believe a sports car gives them the edge , women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits			2
meanwhile , men tended to most associate negative personality traits with drivers of 4x4s , viewing owners of these vehicles as arrogant , rude , and self - centred			0
by comparison , women felt that saloon drivers ( like @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ) were likely to be hard working and safe drivers , while hatchback drivers were seen as being modest			0
both sexes attributed the most positive personality types with eco- car drivers ( such as @entity52 , @entity53 ) , naming them as the most likely to be conscientious , intelligent and also the safest drivers on the road			1
despite being one of the most difficult colours to keep clean , the research found that black is the car colour that is most likely to turn someone ’s head			0
not so fast ! while men might believe a sports car gives them the edge , women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits and prefer those who drive eco-friendly cars the research suggests that the perfect car for a man looking to attract a partner would be a black eco-car , such as a @entity53 or @entity52			1
@entity74 , a spokesman for @entity75 , who carried out the research , said : ' our survey provided an interesting snapshot into how people perceive car drivers , with the bad boy sports car stereotype still holding true			0
' the disparity between men and women suggests that the yummy mummy “ @entity90 tractor ” stereotype might be having a similar effect on men as sports cars appear to be having on women			0
' while there is no doubt that owning the @entity99 or a @entity100 would be a conversation starter if you ’re looking to meet new people , in reality the car we buy is likely to make us feel more confident rather than make other people find us more attractive			0
' opposite effect : while 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex , women labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant , self - centred and dangerous			1

some 48 *%* of men think an expensive car makes them more attractive
black eco-car , such as a @entity53 or @entity52 , is most attractive
men *dislike* women who drive 4x
