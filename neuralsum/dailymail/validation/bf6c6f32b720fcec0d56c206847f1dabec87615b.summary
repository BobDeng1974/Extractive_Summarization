a reporter for @entity1 in @entity2 has come under fire for telling very different versions of a home invasion story that she has repeated while advocating gun ownership			1
@entity8 , the chief investigative reporter for @entity9 , has previously claimed she fell victim to a terrifying home invasion on @entity12 in 2010 while dog - sitting for friends at their house			1
in one interview for the @entity17 , she said she returned to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men			1
but a police report has now revealed a very different - and far less harrowing - tale than the one she has shared publicly			1
she asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood , the police report noted , and left			1
@entity8 , who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog , went into the house and ' felt that something was not right ' , according to the report , so left to take a photo of his car			1
outside , the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving , and @entity8 saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company			1
but later that evening , her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $ 50 were missing , according to the report			1
she had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog			1
the police report shows that after she told police about the fraudulent activity on her card , they tracked down the purchases to a @entity73 and a tattoo shop			2
harrowing : in one retelling of the story , for a 2014 video for the @entity17 ( pictured ) , @entity8 said she returned to find the home being robbed and the man took off with her wallet terrifying : a reenactment of the crime in the @entity17 video shows it happened at night , rather than at 3pm but when police tried to contact her to take the case further , she did not return messages they left on her phone on three separate occasions and the report was suspended			1
the tale is far more dramatic when she re-tells it			0
in one example , she recounted the story on a video for the @entity17			0
a reenactment of the robbery in the video shows the robbery unfolding at night , rather than at 3pm as shown in the police report			2
tale : in her book , @entity8 says she attempted to take the man 's photo in the street but he stopped her ' a man - the police believed to be a drug addict - got into the house and started robbing it , ' she said on the video			1
' so when i came back into the house he was in there robbing			0
' he took my wallet but i was able to talk him out of the house without hurting me , thank @entity116			0
' she claims she then decided to follow him to get a picture - ' which was really stupid ' - and came across 15 men standing around two pickup trucks in the street			2
when they saw her , they started running towards her and she fled back to the house , where she called the police , she said			0
' going to bed that night in this house , it was the first time in my life i thought " i just wish i had a gun by my night table then i can defend myself if those men come in " , ' she said			0
@entity8 has also said she was a ' victim of a home invasion ' on other occasions , including in speeches			1
and in a series for the @entity138 , ' @entity136 ' , she said the man told her he had come to service the swimming pool before leaving			0
she followed him with her phone			0
' i walked down the street , and as i turned the corner , i saw about 15 scruffy young men standing around two pickup trucks , ' she wrote			0
when she held up her phone to take a photo , a man blocked her shot and demanded to know what she was doing			0
' " nothing , i 'm um , just going now , " i said as i put my @entity150 down instead of taking the picture around him and went home , ' she wrote - not mentioning a chase			0
she later turned her @entity138 series into a book , ' @entity136 ... but @entity158 wants to take yours ' , which was published in september 2013			0
advocate : she has shared the story while advocating for gun rights in @entity2 in a recent series on @entity165 , she charted her attempts to get a gun in the state according to @entity35 of the @entity36 , the discrepancies in her story are important because she ' has hitched her career ' on it			1
she has cited the incident as a driving force behind her wish to get a gun in @entity2 , and has charted her attempt in a series on @entity165			2
in a report on @entity165 last week , she revealed that she had been approved for the gun permit after providing the state two police reports showing threats on her life , she said			2
in another questionable move , she has been described as a pro-gun advocate while still working as a journalist			0
@entity1 identified her as ' a proponent of @entity190 rights ' when it published her recent stories			2
when reached by @entity192 for comment , @entity8 , 44 , directed requests to @entity1 's public relations team , who have yet to respond			2
before working for @entity1 , she worked for the @entity138 , @entity198 's @entity197 and @entity199 , according to her online bio .			0
