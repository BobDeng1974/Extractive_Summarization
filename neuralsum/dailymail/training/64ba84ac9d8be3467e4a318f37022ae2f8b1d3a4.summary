by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 19 july 2013 sunday night ’s legal drama @entity2 : @entity3 conjures images of pulsating glamour , where barristers duel with words across hallowed courtrooms			1
they are defending the very fabric of civilisation , even as they ’re falling in love with their bitterest opponents			1
here ’s the reality , on @entity16 ( @entity17 ) : a bearded solicitor in a horsehair wig sucks at a ciggie on the steps of a magistrates ’ court in @entity24			1
not so glamorous : the briefs offers viewers an insight into @entity29 justice from the perspective of the defence @entity33 - smile of weariness flickers through the fag smoke — he ’s seen it all , and he knows there ’s not a shred of romance anywhere in the system			1
it ’s a tawdry , depressing treadmill			1
nearly three - quarters of the defendants who get legal aid from law firm @entity45 are repeat offenders			1
some of them return dozens of times : one youth on a charge of armed robbery has been a @entity53 client since he was 11 — ten years later , he was ready for his 36th court appearance			1
he did n’t seem to think he had done anything wrong , though his solicitor reproved him : ‘ if you brandish an axe in a public place , that would constitute a breach of your @entity62			1
’ the youth walked free , because @entity53 stirred up confusion about his identity			2
afterwards , the solicitor , dragging hard on his cigarette , muttered something about the burden of proof			2
he had got his client off , but he did n’t look proud of it			2
legal aid work looks soul - destroying : this programme certainly was			2
we met a professional thief called @entity78 who was furiously indignant to be charged with a crime that , for once , he had n’t committed			2
accused of criminal damage , @entity78 ’s self - righteous defence was clear - cut : ‘ i am a thief , right , and if i ’m going to do something , i ’m going to do it for financial purposes			1
’ to hear @entity78 tell it , he was a modern - day @entity87 who , under this unjust accusation , had become the @entity29 @entity90			1
the courts sent him on his way , presumably to burgle more businesses			2
to the perma - tanned senior partner at @entity95 , @entity94 , revving into the court car - park in his open - top sports car , repeat clients were meat and drink			2
food for thought : we spend £ 2.4 billion annually on biscuits , @entity29 's @entity103 presenter @entity102 informed us @entity94 was full of praise for one regular , a fat scar - faced yob called @entity109 who was constantly getting into fights			1
‘ he ’s the perfect client , ’ @entity94 insisted			1
‘ he takes our advice and he ’s never any trouble			1
’ the courts disagreed after 23 - year - old @entity109 threatened a police officer with a knife			0
@entity109 ’s defence , that a friend had dropped the knife and @entity109 had picked it up for safekeeping , perhaps was n’t their most watertight			1
@entity109 got four - and - a - half years			0
if the statistics for repeat crime in @entity24 were grim , the figures trotted out on @entity29 ’s @entity103 ( @entity124 ) were wholly head - spinning			1
as a nation , we drink 60 billion cups of tea a year			0
that , presenter @entity102 informed us , was enough to fill the @entity130 150 times over			0
legal aid work looks soul - destroying : this programme certainly was @entity102 looked humbled by this statistic			0
but images like this are n’t helpful , because they divert the mind from the facts and start us puzzling about irrelevant problems			0
such as , how would you empty the @entity130 , once it was filled with tea ? if you simply opened the doors and let it pour down the steps , the surrounding streets would be awash			0
the nearby @entity147 would be flooded			0
there ’d be hell to pay			0
we spend £ 2.4 billion annually on biscuits , we eat 11.5 billion sandwiches , every one of us gobbles 128 packets of crisps each year , and if you lined up all the soup tins produced by a single factory , they would stretch from @entity159 to @entity160			0
but how could you line up cans across the ocean , @entity102 ? they ’d sink			0
were you proposing some sort of platform linking the continents , like a transatlantic @entity167 ? have you considered the practicalities ? @entity102 is a distracting presenter generally			0
she has the brisk demeanour and exaggerated facial expressions of a primary school teacher			0
frowning , gaping , goggling , blinking and gasping , she threw herself at the cereal aisles and the fruit - and - veg section			0
full marks for trying , at any rate			0
which is much more than you could ever say for @entity53 ’ clients .			0
