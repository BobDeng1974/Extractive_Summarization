you ’ve just bought a new outfit and you ’d really like a new nail polish to co-ordinate with it			1
or perhaps you ’ve picked up a dress for a party the same night and it needs more of a glitzy make - up look than usual			1
now , you no longer need to hotfoot it to the department store or chemist to stock up on make - up — because fashion retailers have got in on the beauty act			1
fashion retailers have started to get in on the beauty act with plenty of shops now offering their own make - up ranges as well as clothing from @entity20 to @entity21 , they ’re all at it , flogging foundation and lippy alongside frocks and leggings			1
but are any of them worth splashing your cash on ? @entity27 put some of the biggest fashion beauty brands to the test			1
@entity31 the @entity33 giant has all of this season ’s beauty looks , from a rainbow of nail polishes ( £ 6 ) to @entity38 ( £ 9 ) — sets of two cream - to - powder formulation lip colours to be worn in tandem ( caution : lips must be very well moisturised )			1
@entity44 ( £ 16 ) was a rather pleasant surprise			1
it has a good amount of silicone , so slides on easily , and coverage is smooth — but there are only four shades and the dropper applicator is a bit of a gimmick			1
@entity31 's eye shadow ( top left and right ) creates an iridescent shimmer and the @entity59 colour is perfect for a smokey eye while the @entity33 giant also stocks a wide range of nail polish and lip colour @entity64 buy : @entity65 ( £ 5 )			1
do n’t be put off by their initial glittery appearance			1
once on , they ’re not nearly as sparkly , with more of an iridescent shimmer			1
@entity59 , a purplish black , is perfect for a smokey eye			1
do n’t bother with : concealer ( £ 10 )			2
the pump bottle dispenses more than you need			2
it covers well , but the result is flat , with not enough luminescence to brighten the under - eye area			1
next make me beautiful this collection , in its chunky silver and transparent packaging , was a real surprise			1
with everything from @entity87 ( £ 4 ) to @entity88 ( £ 7.50 ) , which can be used wet or dry , in elegant , wearable shades , there ’s something for everyone			2
but i wish they would n’t package stuff together , like the @entity95 and @entity96 ( £ 20 for both ) — the former has too much silicone and feels greasy , while the latter has a subtle glow to wear alone or under foundation			2
next 's @entity102 ( pictured ) is moisturising with tonnes of pigment and almost matches up to @entity107 ’s @entity106 lip colour @entity64 buy : @entity102 ( £ 8 or £ 20 for three )			2
i loved the @entity108 almost as much as @entity107 ’s @entity106 , which is miles more expensive			2
moisturising and with tonnes of pigment , just blot and reapply to get a bit more staying power			2
do n’t bother with : @entity113 ( £ 8 ) — it was greasy and a bit disappointing			2
@entity116 it ’s bargain basement and , on the whole , it looks it , feels it — and smells it			2
the range is all either synthetically sweet or a bit plasticky			2
i worry even pre-teens would turn their noses up at this			0
but if you absolutely had to go straight from @entity21 to a party , had no make - up and only £ 5 to spend , it would do			1
the @entity129 ( £ 1.50 ) looked a bit chalky , but i liked the chubby brush on the @entity132 ( £ 2 ) , even if it was a bit clumpy			0
@entity64 buy : @entity134 ( £ 2 )			0
i would n’t use this as my everyday foundation , but i ’d definitely keep it in my handbag for on - the - go touch - ups			1
it feels a bit greasy , but the coverage is decent and the finish is matte enough not to require powder			0
do n’t bother with : @entity146 ( £ 1.50 )			0
it comes in innovative , twist - up packaging , like a lipstick			1
but there ’s no way of sharpening the point , and it has zero staying power ( unlike the @entity154 , £ 1 , which , once dry , does n’t budge )			0
@entity155 the sleek , black and glossy packaging feels substantial and very @entity157 in style			0
but then , at £ 6 for a nail varnish and £ 10 for a lipstick , this is the most expensive of the brands i tried			0
the @entity166 ( £ 10 ) is moisturising , with a matte — but not flat — finish , while the @entity170 ( £ 9.50 ) are a cut - price version of @entity173 ’s famous @entity172			1
@entity174 ( pictured ) has a great , buildable colour with a slight shimmer but no sparkle these have decent staying power — even if they do only come in four shades			0
on the downside , for a brand that targets the older consumer , there ’s a lot of sparkle in their eye shadows			0
@entity64 buy : @entity190 ( £ 15 )			0
a lovely , moulded bronzer that looks a little @entity192 in style			0
great , buildable colour with slight shimmer , but no sparkle			0
do n’t bother with : neverending lashes @entity198 , ( £ 10 )			0
the absurdly long wand and very thin brush gave little control — i ended up daubing it on my eyebrows ! @entity206 @entity205 if you ’re not a teenager , you probably wo n’t be shopping in @entity206 — and , on the whole , its make - up range reflects that			1
the @entity213 ( £ 3.99 ) are as heavy on glitter as they are on pigment , while the packaging is inelegant			0
@entity206 's @entity205 nail polishes ( pictured ) come in a range of great colours , go on evenly and dry really quickly while the @entity220 in @entity221 gives skin a beautiful sheen but the brushes ( from £ 1.99 ) are n’t bad , and do n’t moult like many cheap brushes do			0
also the @entity226 ( £ 3.99 ) is n’t drying and , while theb comes with more of a cocktail stick applicator than a brush , once applied it stays put			0
@entity64 buy : i was torn between the @entity231 ( £ 2.99 ) , which come in plenty of great colours that go on evenly and dry really quickly , and the @entity220 in @entity221 ( £ 4.99 ) , which gives skin a beautiful , almost soft - focus , sheen			1
do n’t bother with : pure volume @entity236 ( £ 4.99 )			0
it comes out of the tube thick and cloggy — and goes on thick and cloggy			0
one of the worst budget mascaras i ’ve ever used .			0

fashion retailers have started to produce their own make - up ranges
you no longer have to head across town to a chemist or department store
