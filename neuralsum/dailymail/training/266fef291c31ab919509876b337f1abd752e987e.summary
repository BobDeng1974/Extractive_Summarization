the referendum gives us an opportunity to see how much money is due and how we can pursue it			2
' councillor @entity47 , leader of @entity48 , said officers were already scrutinising the updated voters ' roll to see if records tallied up with their own books			2
' if they do n't , we will go after them for that money , ' he said			0
' we do n't ever give up on money owed			0
' a spokesman for @entity58 confirmed it would also pursue debtors through the electoral roll			1
' the council uses all the data available to it to collect outstanding debts , ' she said			0
the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , an umbrella group for councils , backed the steps			0
a spokesman said : ' councils are within their rights to use whatever sources of information are available legally to pursue unpaid debt			2
' @entity5 's councils take collection of debt very seriously and place great emphasis on it for a number of reasons			1
' firstly , every pound of debt collected is a pound for frontline services , and secondly , they feel a moral obligation on those people who do diligently pay tax			1
' the deeply unpopular poll tax was introduced in @entity5 before the rest of the country , in 1989 , and led to widespread rioting the poll tax was abolished in 1993 but over the four years , councils billed @entity5 households for £ 3.678billion - of which just over £ 3.35billion was paid , leaving £ 324.4million still to be collected			1
arrears from the abolished tax in @entity13 and @entity97 were pursued through the court system			1

it was introduced by the @entity12 government to replace the property - rates system , with a simpler , individual local tax			2
@entity114 protests in @entity5 were followed the year later in central @entity115 , and around the country , with violent scenes , looting , smashed shop fronts and mounted police battling to control rioters			2
the poll tax , officially known as the community charge , was eventually scrapped and was integral to the fall of @entity12			0
it was eventually replaced by the council tax in 1993			2
and , if some effort has been made to recover the debt since 1993 , the clock is then reset to 20 years since the last attempt was made			0
nationalists were also keen for councils to pursue poll tax arrears - but split on whether they should use voter registration to do it			0
@entity135 , an @entity136 councillor in @entity137 , said : ' if people deliberately did not pay , and can afford to pay , then they should do			0
i would not be surprised if some councils are now potentially going after people who have suddenly popped up on their computer			0
' but councillor @entity143 , @entity136 leader in @entity31 , said : ' clearly , there is a duty on local authorities to pursue debts through means available to them but the fear that will be there for some folk , keeping them from exercising their vote , is bad for democracy and ultimately bad for government at all levels			0
' @entity158 has the largest unpaid debt , with £ 125million outstand - ing. the council uses the electoral roll to trace debtors but is understood to be sceptical about how helpful the surge in registered voters will prove to be			1

' however , it becomes increasingly difficult to secure payments from historic accounts as time passes			0
in many cases , it is impossible as a substantial number of people will now have passed away			0
