by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 04:36 est , 19 june 2012 even the most determined entrepreneur could falter in the face of outright ridicule from the hard - to - please investors on @entity5 ’ @entity6			2
two years after @entity8 told him he ’d rather stick pins in his eyes than back his idea for a collapsible water bottle , his invention is available in 16 countries – and he has sold 100,000 of them			1
and if that was not enough to convince the @entity5 they had missed a trick , he has also signed a distribution deal with @entity19			1
dismissive : dragon @entity8 was not impressed with @entity6 's collapsible plastic water bottle invention when the inventor appeared on the show two years ago the chain is selling the bottle , called @entity26 , near checkouts and in its takeaway food @entity28 in @entity29 , the ‘ collapsabottle ’ is sold as a cheap and environmentally friendly alternative to buying bottled water			1
mr @entity6 originally presented his idea to the @entity35 ’s five dragons – mr @entity8 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 – in 2010			1
all five dismissed the idea , and even by the standards of the notoriously tough show , they gave mr @entity6 a grilling			1
an angry mr @entity37 said the @entity26 would not take any sales from the bottled water market			1
‘ this is not something that is going to sell in anything like the volume you think , ’ he said			0
mr @entity36 , who runs gyms , described the bottles as cumbersome – and got so angry that he threw one across the room			0
he said : ‘ this is a terrible invention			0
i just can not see the point of this			0
’ confident : @entity6 makes his pitch for his collapsible plastic water bottle product on @entity61 in 2010 mr @entity8 was particularly dismissive and delivered the final blow , saying : ‘ this is one of those “ i ’d really want to stick pins in my eyes ” moments			1
you ’ve got five sophisticated investors here who do n’t want to be treated like idiots			0
’ the buyers at @entity19 , however , took a different view			1
@entity74 , its ‘ @entity76 ’ expert , said : ‘ this is perfect for the summer months when you ’re on the go and need a bottle of water to hand without the hassle of having to carry something heavy around			1
we are going to be stocking it near our till points and as part of our “ @entity76 ” range so it can be easily picked up by our customers who we know like to buy food and drink they can enjoy when on the go			0
’ the @entity26 is also on sale in 15 other countries , including @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
the plastic bottles have a concertina design so that , when compressed , they are only a third of their original size , small enough to be carried in a handbag or pocket			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ 100,000 @entity110 pocket - bottles later , it seems the public and the @entity5 reached very different verdicts			0
popular : the @entity26 is on sale in the @entity110 and 15 other countries			0
more than 100,000 collapsible bottles have now been sold ‘ it ’s a real vote of confidence that @entity19 spotted the environmental and commercial benefits of collapsabottles			1
to have @entity26 collapsible bottles available nationwide , and internationally , means we ’re now in that luxurious position of being able to cast the @entity5 aside , and not vice versa			2
‘ it ’s pretty clear that the @entity5 were the only people who did n’t understand the value of our product			0
it ’s handy , convenient and sustainable and makes a great alternative to buying bottled water			1
’ the brightly coloured bottles , which expand to hold 500ml of water , cost £ 4.99			2
it is not the first time that an invention rejected on @entity5 ’ @entity138 has been picked up with great success by @entity19			2
@entity141 ’s idea for a ‘ cup - a - wine ’ was dismissed by the show ’s investors , but @entity19 later made him an offer , and in 2010 began selling a single - serve plastic cup of its @entity148 wine			1
the cups , which have a tear - off lid , proved hugely popular , particularly with concert - goers and picnickers , and initially sold out			0
@entity19 has since extended the range to include a four pack			2
video : the durability of an @entity26 bottle is put to the test			2

two years after dragon *slammed* collapsible bottle idea a *worldwide* hit
inventor has also signed a distribution deal with @entity19
bottle is cheap environmentally friendly alternative to bottled water
all five dragons dismissed idea and gave entrepreneur a grilling
