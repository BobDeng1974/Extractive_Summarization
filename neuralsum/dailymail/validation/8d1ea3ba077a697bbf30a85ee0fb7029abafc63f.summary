diary : the new guidance from @entity2 suggests keeping a diary of everything you eat to help keep those extra pounds off they are pastimes that millions of us do every week to keep relatively fit and healthy			1
dancing , gardening and walking up hills are all well - known as simple exercises that would help to fight the flab			2
but the health watchdog @entity2 believes we should be given official guidance to remind those who do n’t bother - and that we should keep a daily diary alongside details of meals , snacks and drinks			1
the watchdog warns to pay particular attention to lattes , high protein drinks , nuts and alcohol which contain hidden calories they may not realise they have consumed			1
it is estimated that a quarter of adults in the @entity32 are obese although this is projected to increase to almost two thirds by 2050			1
the condition is thought to cost the health service and economy £ 16 billion a year through medical treatment , sick days and benefits			2
officials from @entity2 hope that encouraging adults to ‘ self - monitor ’ their activity and food intake will prompt them to adopt healthier lifestyles			1
they are particularly concerned that the emergence of a ‘ coffee culture ’ in recent years has led to @entity32 consuming calorie - laden lattes and muffins on top of their meals and snacks			1
guidance also points out that many adults who do exercise underdo the good work immediately afterwards by ‘ refuelling ’ on high sugar sports drinks and protein shakes			0
additionally , the watchdog instructs parents to avoid giving children sweets at weekends , the school holidays or even for good behaviour			2
even in small amounts , they can ‘ disrupt ’ everyday healthy eating habits and lead to obesity , they state			0
other recommendations include urging adults not to drink too much alcohol as this also contains high numbers of hidden calories			0
it points out that even if a woman sticks within the recommended safe limits of 2 to 3 units a day – a large glass of wine – this contains as many calories as @entity87 bar			0
do n't undo good work at the gym by drinking protein shakes or high sugar sports drinks afterwards			0
avoid calorific coffees like lattes – and the muffins and cakes that come with them			0
remember nuts and alcohol have ' hidden calories '			0
do n't allow children more than two hours of ' screen time ' a day – which includes watching tv or playing handheld video games			1
have ' tv - free ' days and go on a walk or cycle - ride instead			0
source : @entity2 guidance professor @entity116 , deputy chief executive at @entity2 , said : ‘ overweight and obesity is an enormous concern for the health service in @entity120 , it has a huge personal health cost to the individual and the financial impact of dealing with obesity and its associated conditions and its associated conditions is creating a significant burden on the @entity115			1
‘ a significant amount of effort is needed to lose weight and keep it off			0
this guidance sets out the many things individuals can do to maintain a healthy weight that are known to be effective			0
professor @entity128 , an expert in diet and population health at the @entity131 , said : ‘ in 21st century @entity32 most people are less active than recommended for good health and it is all too easy to eat more calories than we need – weight gain is unfortunately all too common			1
‘ the recommendations emphasise the value of reducing the consumption of energy - dense foods and the amount of time spent sitting down and inactive			2
’ the guidance also states that ideally , children should have no more than two hours screen time a day – which includes watching tv or playing handheld video games			1
parents are also encouraged to have tv - free days either weekly or monthly and spend the time going for a walk or cycle ride			2
@entity153 , of the @entity154 said : ‘ finally @entity2 is getting the message , sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind			2
‘ children , and maybe their parents too , will rebel against the advice that sweets should never be offered as treats on any day of the year - but both will welcome the advice long - term			1
’ move more : it also suggests people try and get more active to keep their weight within healthy levels only yesterday the head of the @entity115 @entity170 launched an initiative that will very overweight patients referred for cookery classes and @entity174 keep fit sessions			1
sessions paid for by the health service will teach adults to boil , grill and steam food rather than dunking them in the frying pan			0
