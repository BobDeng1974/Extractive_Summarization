one of @entity1 's high school classmates says that the presumptive @entity3 presidential nominee was ' evil ' in his younger years , and acted like he was a schoolboy gone mad ' like @entity5 '			1
the @entity1 camp was reeling after the revelations that he forcibly shaved the head of a high school classmate who was regularly taunted for being gay			1
the former governor of @entity12 grabbed tearful @entity13 and hacked away with a pair of scissors because he thought his bleached blond hair was ‘ wrong ’			1
mr @entity1 also supposedly mocked another student who was a closeted gay by shouting ‘ @entity19 ! ’ when he tried to speak in class			1
now , in damage control mode , mr @entity1 's campaign staff have contacted a number of the candidate 's former classmates to try to get them to speak out publicly on his behalf			1
family politics : @entity1 ( left ) is pictured with his father @entity27 and mother @entity28 in 1962 , one year before @entity30 's death that plight is n't going so well , as a number of those contacted have been thinking the choice over			1
@entity35 , a friend of mr @entity1 's who attended @entity36 with the candidate , said that he is ' still debating ' if he will help the campaign after he received a call from mr @entity1 's older brother @entity40			1
' it 's been a long time since we 've been pals , ' mr @entity35 told @entity43			1
though they may not have spoken for some time , mr @entity35 's name does come up on the @entity1 campaign trail as he was the one who threw the party where mr @entity1 met his wife @entity48 mr @entity35 , who says he is not the only classmate to have been contacted by the campaign , was quoted in the explosive @entity52 article as saying that he has ' long been bothered ' by the hair - cutting incident			1
@entity54 , an old friend of mr @entity1 's , called the incident ' bullying supreme '			1
' i grew up with him			1
we were best friends in elementary school			1
@entity1 is wonderful , very bright , an enormously energetic human being … a friend all my life , but this was a side of him that i had n’t seen , ' mr @entity54 said			1
torment : the @entity3 presidential hopeful was said to have taunted students who were known to be gay and those from poor backgrounds at the exclusive @entity36 in @entity69 , @entity70 @entity43 cites an unidentified classmate as saying that ' a lot of guys ' who attended @entity36 have ' really negative memories ' of mr @entity1 's behavior			1
apparently those classmates are hesitant to come forward because of mr @entity1 's denials when the incidents have been discussed			1
the incident supposedly happened in the summer term in 1965 when mr @entity13 , who was a year below mr @entity1 , came back from @entity82 with his hair dyed blond and styled so it was draped over one eye			1
according to the @entity52 , mr @entity1 would not let it go and told his friend @entity87 : ‘ he ca n’t look like that			2
just look at him ! ’ a few days later mr @entity1 assembled a posse which found mr @entity13 , tackled him to the floor and held him down whilst the future governor of @entity12 snipped away			2
when it was completed , the crowd cheered @entity1 as he walked out of the room			2
the incident was recalled by five former @entity98 pupils including @entity99 , a retired prosecutor , who helped hold mr @entity13 down			2
he said : ‘ it happened very quickly , and to this day it troubles me			2
what a senseless , stupid , idiotic thing to do			2
’ @entity54 , who is now a lawyer , added : ‘ it was a hack job			2
’ mr @entity87 , a dentist , also felt bad for not stopping it happening and admitted mr @entity13 was ‘ easy pickins ’			2
' it makes these fellows ( who have told the stories ) very remorseful			2
for ( mr @entity1 ) not to remember it ? it does n't ring true			2
how could the fellow with the scissors forget it ? ' the man told @entity43			1
mr @entity1 was quick to arrange a radio interview on wednesday so that he could make an apology , though that does not seem sufficient to trump the symbolism of the story coming out the day after president @entity120 publicly announced his support of same sex marriage			2
' i participated in a lot of hijinks and pranks during high school and some may have gone too far			0
and for that i apologize , ' mr @entity1 said			0
he continued to try to distance the incident from the debate over same - sex marriage by denying that the perceived homosexuality of the victims had nothing to do with the pranks			0
' ( @entity134 ) was the furthest thing from our minds back in the 1960s , so that was not the case , ' he said , adding that the students involved ' did n't come out of the closet until years later			0
' he said : ‘ back in high school , you know , i did some dumb things			0
if anyone was hurt by that or offended by that , obviously i apologize			0
‘ but overall , high school years were a long time ago '			0
interviews with mr @entity1 ’s former classmates at the $ 54,000 a year @entity36 in @entity69 , @entity70 , reveal he was fond of jokes that were mostly good - natured by sometimes had a hard edge			0
after the shaving incident mr @entity13 ‘ seemed to disappear ’ from life in school and was later expelled for smoking and died in 2004 of liver cancer			0
decades after it happened he ran into one of @entity1 ’s friends who helped hold him down and told him : ‘ it was horrible			0
it ’s something i have thought about a lot since then			0
’ opposition : @entity1 was forced to defend himself saying he was not homophobic the day after president @entity120 said he supported gay marriage family man : from right , @entity70 governor @entity169 , his wife @entity28 , daughter @entity170 and son @entity1 in @entity171 , 1964 friends recalled how he and his friends would be up all night larking around , the sound of his laughter filling the corridors at 2am			1
in @entity179 class however things took a more sinister twist - mr @entity1 had a habit of interrupting fellow pupil @entity183 , a closeted gay at the time , by shouting : ‘ @entity19 ! ’ according to the @entity52 he also behaved in a ‘ sour ’ fashion towards scholarship student @entity186 when he found he he was from a poor area of @entity189			1
mr @entity1 ’s wife @entity190 has claimed that contrary to his public image as a ‘ tin man ’ , as one friend has claimed , he is actually a ‘ wild and crazy man ’			0
it was a hack job			0
@entity54 , former classmate of @entity1 and details about his pranks have come to light before , notably in the biography , ‘ @entity205 ’ , by @entity202 investigative reporters @entity203 and @entity204 the problem with the latest revelations however is that they suggest a cruelty which voters might find hard to stomach			0
@entity1 ’s most famous such incident is also his most controversial - when he strapped his dog to the top of his car whilst on a 12 - hour drive from @entity12 to @entity217 in 1983			0
@entity219 the @entity218 was put in a crate on top of the vehicle because there was n’t room inside			0
among the claims in ‘ @entity205 ’ , is that mr @entity1 once shouted : ‘ oh yeah ! ’ and gave an impromptu rendition of the @entity227 hit ‘ @entity230 ’ at a meeting with other @entity229 - whilst doing the @entity231			1
while at @entity232 he dressed up as an @entity234 protester to infiltrate what he thought was a plot to embarrass the college			0
at @entity98 he also once staged an ‘ elaborate formal dinner ’ in a busy corridor and another time impersonated a cop to scare two girls who were being driven around by two friends			0

mr @entity1 ’s spokeswoman @entity261 said : ‘ anyone who knows @entity1 knows that he does n’t have a mean - spirited bone in his body			0
’ @entity120 's dramatic change of heart on the issue of gay marriage yesterday sent shockwaves through the political world			1
but while gay rights advocates applauded @entity120 's announcement on wednesday , @entity3 accused the commander - in - chief of pulling off a cynical political manoeuvre			1
@entity276 chairman @entity275 accused @entity120 of placating voters			0
@entity275 said in a statement : ' while president @entity120 has played politics on this issue , the @entity3 and our presumptive nominee @entity1 have been clear			1
' @entity120 's announcement also opened up the first major battleground in this year 's election campaign			0
@entity1 himself did not swipe at @entity120 directly , but affirmed his own views on same - sex unions during an @entity290 campaign stop , saying : ' i believe that marriage is between a man and a woman			0
