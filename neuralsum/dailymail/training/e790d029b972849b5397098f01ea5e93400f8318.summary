by @entity0 it should help end the debate around the office kettle			0
although @entity5 drinks 165 million cups of tea a year , there is little agreement on how it should be served			1
in a bid to settle the centuries old argument , scientists have now got together to formulate a step - by - step guide for the perfect cup of tea			1
a nice cup of @entity16 : scientists at @entity18 have managed to work out how to make the perfect cup of tea			1
@entity21 type , water temperature and timing are all crucial and whether you prefer to brew your @entity26 in a mug or teapot , there is one area in which the experts unanimously agreed - for the best results steer clear of disposable cups			1
speaking on the chemistry of tea , professor @entity33 from @entity18 said the perfect cuppa is about ‘ patience , love and care ’			1
but he said the smooth surface of a china cup or mug made not only keeps the natural tannins in the tea from sticking to the side , but the sounds , such as the teaspoon clinking against its hard surface were ‘ comforting ’			1
‘ you want a smooth , impervious surface , you do n’t want cup to bind the tannins			2
and also from a psychological aspect , it provides a lovely association of things like drinking tea with your grandmother which foam cups do not			2
’ using freshly drawn water in the kettle ensures the tea can express its full flavour , as repeated boiling reduces the oxygen content and makes the water harder , giving the brew a chalky film			2
@entity68 , tea buyer from @entity70 said : ‘ always use freshly drawn water , as the longer it boils , the less oxygen it has and the less flavour the leaves impart			2
a delicious infusion requires brewing the tea for between three and five minutes			0
this helps to optimise the balance of flavour and the strength of the drink and as for temperature , let the kettle come to the boil and click off			0
then give it a few seconds before pouring			0
’ controversially , although harder water – common in the south and east of the country - results in a residue forming on the tea ’s surface , for many connoisseurs it produces a better cup			1
‘ although it does n’t look nice , you may get a bit more flavour and body from the minerals reacting with the tea , ’ said mr @entity68			0
temperature also plays a crucial role , with the experts advising drinkers wait a few seconds before pouring the almost boiling water on the tea			1
for more delicate teas , such as green and white , waiting for the kettle to cool to 80c is essential to ensure the leaves are not damaged			0
steer clear of plastic , disposable mugs and use a porcelain cup only use freshly drawn water for the kettle once water is boiled , wait five second before pouring into cup or warmed teapot brewing time between three to five minutes for optimum balance of flavour and strength add five per cent of semi-skimmed milk to the cup before adding tea wait for six minutes for the temperature to drop to @entity125 before drinking ‘ when the water is even 10c hotter , it doubles the rate of chemical reactions			1
in coffee for example , water at 100c can cause a bitter taste			0
with black tea , the temperature is less of an issue , but in green teas , it can damage the flavour , ’ professor @entity33			2
it was the @entity5 that started first started drinking milk with their tea , and have never lost the habit			1
speaking at the @entity146 ( must keep ) , mr @entity68 said : ‘ when tea was first imported to the @entity5 in the 18th century lots of people could n’t afford the fine bone china services			1
the cups available could n’t withstand the heat of the boiling water and would shatter , so milk was added first			1
it also helped to get rid of the bitter taste of some of the cheaper teas			0
’ although brewing time in a mug is slightly reduced compared to a pot , scientists suggested three minutes allows the flavour to best develop			0
the experts recommend around five per cent of milk in the cup – and adding it first if pouring from a teapot – which helps bind with the harsh tannins and make it a smoother , more enjoyable drink			2
‘ the proteins in the milk clump together with the tannins , making a black tea much more easy to drink			2
but adding milk to hot water causes it too ‘ cook ’ slightly , so the ideal would be to pour the tea into your milk and then enjoy , ’ said professor @entity33			1
‘ the ritual of tea making is also important			0
making it in teapot and pouring it in porcelain cups invariably tastes better , even though from a chemical point of view it should be the same however you serve it			0
’ finally , the secret is patience			0
drinking your tea too hot just causes the mouth to burn			0
a wait of six minutes allows the brew to cool down to @entity125 , the perfect temperature for sipping .			0

@entity5 drinks 165 million cups of the beverage a year , but there is little agreement on exactly how a proper cuppa should be made
scientists say that the cup , freshness and temperature of the water as well as the *precise* moment the milk is added are all crucial to tea *'s* chemistry
