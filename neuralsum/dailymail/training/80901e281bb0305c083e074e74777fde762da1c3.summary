president @entity0 is encouraging more employers to adopt family - friendly policies by hosting a daylong summit monday , even though the @entity5 government does n't always set the best example			1
the @entity5 is the only industrialized nation that does n't mandate paid leave for mothers of newborns , although @entity0 says he 'd like to see that change			1
' only three countries in the world report that they do n't offer paid maternity leave and the @entity5 is one of them , ' @entity0 said in his weekly address			1
a few states have acted on their own to give workers paid family leave , but this should be available to everyone , because all @entity5 should be able to afford to care for a family member in need			1
' @entity0 's summit comes in a midterm election year focused in many respects on women voters , and the @entity17 was devoting all its star power to the event and even a surprise appearance by a celebrity to echo @entity0 's criticism of @entity39 policies in today 's workplace			1
@entity41 , who plays single mom @entity42 on the @entity44 drama that takes place at a 1960s ad firm , said , ' in the @entity49 the only place for a story like @entity42 's should be on tv			2

@entity0 adviser @entity81 said in a conference call with reporters sunday that the president is trying to start a national conversation to explore the issue			2
' cost is an issue for any federal program and we need to make sure we do this in a way where we are not raising taxes on middle - class families , ' she said			1
' but we also know what a good investment in our workforce it would be if they had paid leave , and that investment will pay great returns			2
' while some companies offer paid family leave to attract workers , the 1993 @entity102 only requires that employers provide unpaid leave for medical and family reasons			1
@entity109 kisses her husband , vice president @entity56 , as she introduces him at the @entity17 on @entity18 on monday when @entity0 came to the @entity17 , he instituted six weeks of paid leave for his workers when they have a child , get sick or injured or need to care for an ailing family member , using his authority to set his staff 's compensation under the personnel code			1
he does not have the power to award paid leave to other federal workers without congressional action since they are covered under a different section of law			2
the @entity17 has supported the goal of legislation introduced by lawmakers to change that , but it has yet to get through @entity130			0
@entity0 said in an interview broadcast monday on @entity133 's @entity132 that he took a month off when his older daughter , @entity134 , was born			0
he called it ' one of the most precious memories that i 'll ever have ' and said the middle - of - the - night feedings created an irreplaceable bond			0
' we have unpaid family leave right now but for a whole lot of families it means they ca n't use it because they just ca n't afford it , ' he said			1
' a few states have acted on their own to give workers paid family leave , but this should be available to everyone , because all @entity5 should be able to afford to care for a family member in need ' - president @entity0 despite the paid leave for @entity17 staff , the challenges of balancing parenting and working still remain evident there			1
the president 's top aides include several dads of minor children but hardly any mothers with school - age kids — national security adviser @entity167 being one prominent exception			0
' it is a very challenging and demanding environment ' for parents , @entity169 said at a media availability hosted by @entity173			0
' and i think part of what we have to achieve here is to make it easier — that does n't mean it 's going to be easy — it 's just going to be easier			0
and i think that 's what the private sector acknowledges			0
