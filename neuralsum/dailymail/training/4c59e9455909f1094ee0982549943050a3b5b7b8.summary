shedding light on the woes of the upper middle , the ' overheard in @entity2 ' facebook page took the internet by storm			1
infants were heard pining for star fruit and lychees , as mothers barked : ' @entity12 ! you 've had enough @entity14 for one day ! ' but now , as hard - up families turn to budget rivals , a version has been made for the cut - price alternative : @entity19			1
one post on the site , which has more than 2,000 ' likes ' , reads : ' this place is fantastic value for money , i got a shopping trolley that was on display outside for £ 1			1
' another adds : ' @entity55 put that f * * * * * * vodka back you already got a bottle for ya 16th birthday last week ! ! ' the company , with its no frills approach and low prices , has seen sales rise by 31.5 per cent , massively outpacing the big four of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ’s and @entity71			0
@entity19 has made huge efforts to attract @entity74 shoppers by introducing a range of superior products at budget prices from fine wines and spirits , to coffee , olive oil , @entity83 steaks and even fresh goose for @entity85			2
the group slims down its overheads and profit margins to the minimum with minimalist stores , fewer staff and charges for plastic bags			0
confused : compared to the @entity2 version , quotes on the @entity19 page are not littered with elaborate words shoppers : one commenter used the format of @entity102 's song @entity103 to describe the typical @entity19 shopper dialect : while most of the @entity2 quotes have a posh air , @entity19 's shoppers speak in local dialects significantly , it does not stock any of the big brands , like @entity111 ’s and @entity112 , however it has run into trouble for creating its own cheaper copycat versions			1
its approach has proved popular because of the resulting low prices which appeal to a nation suffering the longest and deepest cut in incomes and living standards ever recorded			0
the low prices do not mean poor quality or taste			0
just last week the supermarket won 16 gold medals and another 10 silvers in an annual test to find the nation ’s best own - label supermarket foods			0
the webpage also features a conversation between two shoppers who struggle with simple maths and get confused by half price offers			0
there is also a conversation in which a youngster asks their dad to buy them cigarettes , but he replies : ' @entity142 forgot my fake id '			1
another post about an aubergine sees a boy ask his mum if the vegetable is a cucumber , to which she answers : ' no , it ’s a courgette dumb s * * *			0
' it is a stark contrast from @entity153 in @entity2 , which paints a picture of shoppers whose wealth has left them out of touch with everyday lives			2
popular : it seems the group is a response to the @entity2 page as @entity19 continues to soar in popularity cut - price : @entity19 has gained a name for winning customers with bargains - and it seems that 's all they come for one child was overheard asking his mum if they were ' doing shopping for the boat as well '			1
another parent was reported telling her son : ' @entity175 put that falafel down , you already chose olives with @entity14 for your treat			0
' according to the @entity187 page , one couple in the @entity182 branch in @entity183 who spotted another customer with an @entity69 shopping bag said to each other : ' should she be walking around in here with that ? ' and after a @entity2 butcher told a woman they had run out of fillet steak but she could have topside instead , she replied : ' @entity194 ? why on earth would we feed @entity198 topside ? @entity199 : @entity2 is the darling of the upmarket shopper serving the sturdy middle and upper classes children in @entity2 clearly have different tastes to those whose parents shop in less exclusive supermarkets nightmare : @entity2 customers can hardly imagine the horror of running out of such culinary essentials ' anyone would think you wanted to kill the poor dog			1
' ( to this , one @entity187 user replied : ' you have to work at @entity2 , as i did for 27 years , to know that comments like this are not fictitious			2
' ) a customer in the @entity222 , @entity223 , branch was overheard telling her husband : ' please do n't rummage in the reduced bin , darling , someone from the golf club might see you			0
' one child following its mother down an aisle asked : ' @entity234 , are we doing shopping for the boat as well ? ' meanwhile , the @entity19 page describes one shopper using the form of @entity102 's song low : ' she 's got them @entity244 bottom jeans , fake uggs with the furr , the whole of @entity19 was looking at her '			1
