the @entity100 - based practitioner said by sitting badly at work , slouching in the car or walking with rounded shoulders , people compromise their posture , putting excess strain on different parts of the body , which over time can lead to pain and in some cases structural changes in the body			2
he said to maintain good posture it is vital to regularly move around , taking breaks from sitting or standing in one position			0
he said : ' bad posture can lead to breathing difficulties , it can slow down your digestive system , as well as causing the more common complaints of low back pain , neck and shoulder pain , tension headaches , aching through the hips and more			1
' people often come to see me after they ’ve injured themselves doing something at the weekend , like working in the garden , but often the problem stems from the posture they have adopted during the preceding days			0
' i advise many of my patients to imagine they are a string puppet being pulled up through the top of their head , which engages your core muscles and in turn your shoulders will drop , your neck will elongate and your rib cage will lift			0
' this allows you to breath more easily and reduces the load on your lumbar spine			0
my patients often tell me they are lighter on their feet as a result			0
