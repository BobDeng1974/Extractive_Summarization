@entity0 has joined a growing chorus of high - profile stars to raise concerns about professional rugby ’s ‘ gym - monkey ’ culture at academy level amid fears careers will be cut short by increasingly brutal collisions			1
the 36 - year - old @entity10 8 , who only turned fully professional 11 seasons ago and was not involved in academy rugby , believes the size of youngsters entering the sport now is cause for serious concern			1
a mail on sunday investigation earlier this year found the @entity21 under 18 side that played @entity22 last season was heavier man - for - man than @entity26 ’s 1991 senior @entity21 side that reached the @entity28 final			1
@entity0 charges into the @entity30 defence during his side 's 14 - 13 loss at the @entity33 on saturday @entity34 makes the hard yards against @entity36 during @entity21 's @entity28 pool match in @entity38 in 2011 @entity34 ( left ) gets to grips with @entity40 no 8 @entity41 during the @entity43 quarterfinal @entity34 ( right ) offloads to @entity44 during @entity21 's @entity43 final defeat to @entity46 in @entity47 ‘ if i ’d been playing high - level club and international rugby at 20 or 21 in an attritional position like no 8 i ’m not so sure my body is in the same condition it is now			1
that is the fear for a lot of the youngsters coming through now			0
they are two or three stone heavier per man than @entity21 under 18 sides of the past and yet they are running at higher collision speeds now			1
‘ it might be a good thing that they are doing all their weights and are on the protein shakes building their muscles up but there are other areas of your body that probably are n’t fully developed and are taking a lot of hits			0
there might be a few repercussions as far as that is concerned in years to come			0
’ the remarkable increase in the size of schoolboy players has coincided with an unprecedented period of success for the @entity21 under 18 side which has yet to be translated into the senior team			1
a mail on sunday investigation earlier this year found the @entity21 under 18 side that played @entity22 last season was heavier man - for - man than @entity26 ( above ) and his 1991 senior @entity21 side @entity34 is not the first senior professional player to claim the next generation of players are focusing too much on weight training and not enough on skills , with former @entity21 lock @entity96 first raising concerns back in 2009			1
but those concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears			0
‘ someone like @entity101 is naturally a big bloke but the guys who naturally are n’t that big are potentially a worry , ’ @entity0 added			2
‘ you see a lot of the tall and lithe back rows and second rows who are told to bulk up			0
you see it when they have a shoulder injury or an upper body injury because they completely lose their mass. you think “ @entity117 , that ’s probably what they are naturally like ”			2
former @entity21 lock @entity96 raised concerns about the size of modern rugby players back in 2009 ‘ when they are training they all look pretty much the same but some guys are naturally quite big and can put up with punishment but others find it harder to keep the weight on			1
their bodies are not meant for that punishment			0
’ last week @entity133 chief executive @entity132 admitted to serious concerns about the number of positive doping tests returned in junior rugby in recent times while insisting the professional game is too tightly monitored for a doping culture to exist			0
another @entity21 star who did not go down the academy path , @entity143 , agrees the sheer size of young players is a worry			1
veteran @entity147 fly half @entity149 believes there is too much of an emphasis on weight training ‘ not everyone goes the conventional route of academies , ’ @entity143 told @entity154			2
‘ i ’m happy with the way it ’s gone			2
you see a lot of people who have been in the system for a long time and that sort of training routine leaves their bodies getting smashed			0
’ @entity147 fly - half @entity149 , 34 , believes the emphasis on weight training among the next generation of @entity172 - qualified players is bound to have a detrimental effect on the national team			2
‘ we seem to have gone away as a culture from kids playing enough rugby to trying to make them big in the gym , ’ @entity149 said			0
‘ now it seems to be about how much you can lift rather than developing kids with skill			0
‘ that ’s the big difference between us and the southern hemisphere			0
’ @entity21 number eight @entity143 ( centre ) agrees the sheer size of young players is a worry			1
