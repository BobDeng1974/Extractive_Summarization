by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 13 march 2013 councils that dish out spot fines for feeding the ducks or putting up lost cat posters were accused last night of using the public as a ‘ cash cow ’			1
@entity8 secretary @entity7 launched a ferocious attack on town halls for milking residents after a report revealed a five-fold increase in town halls ’ use of penalty notices in a decade			1
nearly 1,400 fines are handed out every week for petty ‘ offences ’ such as handing out leaflets without a licence , dropping a cigarette butt in your own garden and overfilling rubbish bins , the study found			1
milking the public : @entity7 has slated local authorities for their abuse of spot fines residents have been fined up to £ 85 for feeding the ducks , putting up a ‘ lost cat ’ poster and walking a dog in a banned zone			1
the report , published by the @entity38 think - tank , found that fines shot up when councils introduced targets or outsourced fine collection to a private sector company			1
@entity44 mr @entity7 said such practices were ‘ unacceptable ’ and would ‘ undermine justice ’			1
his comments signal that ministers are considering reining in such powers , which have been extended dramatically in the past decade			2
on the up : police issued 226,000 spot fines last year ‘ this timely report highlights concerns over the proliferation of fixed penalty notices introduced by the last @entity59 government , ’ he said			1
‘ local councils should not be using residents as cash cows and persecuting people for petty or insignificant breaches of municipal rules			1
it is clearly unacceptable for external contractors to be paid based on the volume of penalties or the revenue raised – this both undermines the quality of justice and erodes public confidence			2
’ in 2001 , around 13,926 spot fines were imposed by councils , mostly for litter and dog fouling			1
by last year , that had increased more than five-fold to 72,136 , including 278 fines for unauthorised leafleting and 2,734 bin fines			1
the number of litter penalties increased to 63,883			2
the report includes a string of cases in which members of the public claim they have been trapped by officials hiding in bushes or otherwise out of view waiting for them to commit an ‘ offence ’			0
the report also says that police handed out 226,000 penalty notices for disorder last year			0
their number has fallen from their peak in the mid- 2000s but they are still used for minor offences and , worryingly , for more serious offences such as theft and criminal damage			0
the use of spot fines by police and town halls combined has increased 16-fold in the past decade			1
abuse : the number of spot fines issued have increased five-fold in a decade when police figures are included , the number of spot fines has risen 16-fold in a decade			1
council cases include : a mother fined £ 75 for feeding ducks			0
the official who levied the fine said @entity123 ’s one - year - old son @entity122 escaped a fine only because he was ‘ too young to prosecute ’			0
mrs @entity123 , 26 , was fined for being outside ‘ designated feeding areas for birds ’ in @entity127 , @entity128			0
a woman fined by @entity130 for putting ‘ commercial waste ’ in her domestic rubbish because she had included a single work bank statement			0
officials had searched through residents ’ bins			0
a couple threatened with a spot fine for ‘ anti-social behaviour ’ after they put up posters appealing for the return of their lost cat			2
@entity144 and @entity145 were told to remove the notices from lamp - posts in @entity148 , @entity149			0
a woman handed an £ 80 litter fine after her toddler grandchild dropped some crisps on the pavement			0
@entity155 picked up the packet of @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 , but two crisps remained on the ground			0
@entity44 mp @entity162 , who wrote an introduction to the @entity38 report , said the growth of council spot fines was a ‘ troubling development ’			1
he said : ‘ we should be concerned by the arbitrary abuse of decent people in their daily lives by jobsworth officials or their private sector agents			0
’ @entity174 , the report ’s author , said : ‘ too often , public authorities ’ answer to every problem is simply to dole out fines			2
this is lazy at best and profiteering at worst			0
on - the - spot fines have their place for procedural violations such as parking , but this unprecedented expansion to criminal justice and the public services is a recipe for injustice and corruption			1
’ the report found 15 councils have outsourced fine collection to a private company , @entity194 , which receives around £ 45 of every £ 75 fine			2
to october 2012 it had issued 43,498 fines and was paid £ 1.6million			2
the report warns about the lack of a formal appeal system , meaning people must to go to court to challenge a fine , and accuses councils of targeting the normally law - abiding			1
@entity206 , deputy chairman of the @entity207 ’ @entity205 , criticised the ‘ inappropriate ’ use of penalty notices for serious offences which should be dealt with in court			0
‘ this report highlights that a similar problem seems to exist where relatively trivial offences are concerned , ’ he said			0
‘ justice should be seen to be delivered fairly , openly and transparently , no matter what the offence			0

@entity7 slated councils for using the public as a ' cash cow '
he added that they should not fine people for petty breaches of the rules
this comes after it was revealed that the number of spot fines issued has increased five-fold in a decade
