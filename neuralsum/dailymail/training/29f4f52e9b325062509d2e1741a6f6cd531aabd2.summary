quetiapine is an anti-psychotic drug used to treat bipolar and schizophrenia			0
when he saw her again nine days later he also prescribed the anti-depressant sertraline as quetiapine is only considered a short - term remedy for emotional problems , the inquest heard			1
@entity42 affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause depression , panic , anxiety , or obsessive - compulsive symptoms			2
although not recommended for patients under 18 years old , the inquest was told by a medical experts that use of such drugs is common and that the risk of death ' extremely rare			1
' dr @entity24 saw her a third time at her home on september 25 , when she mentioned she had not been taking sertraline as she ' did n't see the point			0
' @entity0 's mother @entity61 wept as she told the hearing : ' she was just my @entity0			1
' coroner @entity65 reviewed her statement and said : ' you say she had a few problems at school			2
' @entity0 had cut herself so badly at school that it required hospital treatment			1
' you went to school and were told that @entity0 had put a knife to her own throat and she said she would kill herself			1
@entity0 's mother @entity61 described the teenager , pictured , as her ' everything ' and said she ' was lovely ' ' while she was at the hospital @entity0 had to be restrained but then she was discharged later that night			1
' mrs @entity61 replied : ' she told me about what she was going			0
sometimes she would show me the cuts and sometimes she would n't			0
' @entity84 would ring up and say she needs to go to the hospital because she has cuts on her arms			0
' the coroner recounted the morning mrs @entity61 found her daughter unresponsive in her bed at her home in @entity92 , @entity93 , on october 8			1

' attempts to resuscitate @entity0 were carried out but she was later declared dead			2
her psychiatrist dr @entity24 told the inquest that the use of unlicensed drugs such as @entity106 are commonly used for children			1
he said : ' there are very few medications that have a licence for young people or children and that is in regards to mental health issues			2
' like many other medications it has a licence to be used for psychiatric illness in adults - for people with bipolar			2
' but these groups of medication that do not have a license are not recommended for people under 18			0
' there are a number of reasons why			0
it is very difficult to find evidence that they work on children			0
' when asked by the family if there were any licensed medications he could have prescribed , dr @entity24 said : ' they are all unlicensed			2
there is no licensed medication for children that age			2
' a pathologist , who conducted a post mortem examination on the teenager , was unable to determine a cause of @entity0 's death			1
forensic pathologist , @entity146 said : ' quetiapine is a anti-psychotic drug used for schizophrenia , depression and bipolar disorders			0
it is reported to have some adverse effects when taken therapeutically including drowsiness and headaches			0
' there are also reports of effects to the heart			0
it can affect the rhythm of your heart beat and can lead to irregular heart rhythm although this is considered to be extremely rare			0
the cause of a cardiac event would increase with a higher dose			0
' quetiapine is not generally recommended for children under 18			0
there is a lack of clinical trials to support its use rather than a specific risk of prescribing it for that age group			0
therefore it may be prescribed for under 18s in some instances			0
the risk of cardiac event is extremely small when used in therapeutic doses			0
' coroner mr @entity65 recorded an open verdict and said : ' i can not say it was an accident or accidental death			1
' i can not say it was drugs - related or related to prescribed drugs as the evidence is the medication was prescribed only in therapeutic doses or levels			1
