but legalizing it does n't eliminate the black market or solve a state 's budget problems			0
those are the lessons from @entity7 's first full year of tax collections on recreational pot. the year - end report , released tuesday , tallied about $ 44 million in new sales taxes and excise taxes from recreational pot. add fees and pre-existing taxes from medical pot , which has been legal since 2000 , and @entity7 's total 2014 pot haul was about $ 76 million			1
taxes : @entity7 tallied about $ 44 million in new sales taxes and excise taxes from recreational pot in 2014 @entity7 was the first government anywhere in the world to regulate marijuana production and sales , so other governments are watching closely			1
estimates varied widely for how much money @entity7 would make , and the final hard numbers have important lessons for other states considering legal weed markets			1
@entity7 started selling recreational weed on jan. 1 , 2014			1
but its first month of sales resulted in only $ 1.6 million for the state			1
by december , that figure was $ 5.4 million			2
for reference , in february , it was about $ 1.8 million ; march , about $ 2.5 million ; april , about $ 3 million ; may , approximately $ 3.2 million ; june , about $ 3.4 million ; july , approximately $ 4.4 million ; august , about $ 4.8 million ; september , about $ 4.4 million ; october , approximately $ 5 million ; and november , approximately $ 4.3 million			2
@entity38 reported that the $ 44 million figure is lower than what was first predicted , writing that ' new taxes were estimated to bring in about $ 70 million			1
' the reason for the increase ? regulatory delays			0
red tape meant stores opened slowly , with many municipalities waiting months before allowing pot shops to open			0
in @entity50 , delays were even more pronounced			0
@entity50 voters legalized pot at the same time @entity7 did , in 2012			1
but retail sales in @entity50 did n't start until june , with stores slowly opening and sales increasing each month			0
things will speed up as more states legalize pot and can look to @entity7 and @entity50 for regulatory guidance			1
but legal weed is n't an overnight flood of tax money			2
' everyone who thinks @entity7 's rollin ' in the dough because of marijuana ? that 's not true , ' said state sen. @entity67 , a @entity69 @entity68 and one of the @entity72 's main budget - writers			1
@entity50 and @entity7 set vastly different tax rates , both based on a percentage of the pot 's value			1
the states then had to immediately set a value for a product with no legal sales history			2
what 's the right price ? @entity7 's pot regulators have struggled to establish a wholesale pot price to collect excise taxes			1
' taxing a percentage of price may simply not work , ' said @entity89 , a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana 's tax potential at the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			2
he pointed out that the two latest legal weed states — @entity96 and @entity97 , both still working on retail regulations — will tax marijuana by weight , similar to how tobacco is taxed			2
every state in the union , liberal to conservative , has a market for marijuana			0
and making pot legal does n't guarantee those consumers will leave the black market and happily sign up to start paying taxes			1
in @entity50 , medical marijuana is n't taxed			0
it is in @entity7 , but all adults are allowed to grow up to six plants on their own			2
that means the states ' new marijuana markets had legal competition from @entity119			0
and that does n't account for the black market , which of course is completely free of taxes and regulations			0
lawmakers in both @entity7 and @entity50 are looking for ways to drive pot smokers out of the lower - taxed medical pot market and into the recreational one			1
' if there is untaxed medical pot , the taxes are voluntary			1
when you make it voluntary , people wo n't necessarily pay , ' @entity89 said			0
the marijuana market is far from settled			0
@entity7 benefited from first - in - the - nation curiosity and marijuana tourism			2
as more states legalize , @entity7 and @entity50 will face competition			0
' @entity7 is probably kind of a best - case scenario ' for pot tax collections , said @entity144 , a @entity145 economist who studies the drug market			1
' if a number of other states legalize — and two of them already have — then bit by bit , @entity7 revenue is likely to decline			0
' there 's an even bigger uncertainty looming for states considering legal weed — a new president in 2016			0
' the huge unknown is still federal policy , ' @entity144 said			0
' a new president can radically change state policies toward legalization			0
' senators @entity67 , left , @entity69 , and @entity164 , @entity69 , are seen in this 2013 file photo			0
@entity67 is one of @entity7 's legislative budget - writers and has been tasked with following @entity7 's pot tax collections			1

@entity7 's year - end tax report was released tuesday
the report tallied about $ 44 million in new sales taxes and excise taxes from recreational pot
add fees and pre-existing taxes from medical pot , which has been legal since 2000 , and @entity7 's total 2014 pot haul was about $ 76 million
