by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 today becomes the most senior figure to demand @entity4 joins the @entity5 in carrying out bombing raids against @entity8 fanatics			1
as @entity10 finally returns from his holidays , the former defence secretary calls on the prime minister to sanction the use of our military to protect civilians from ' barbaric ' @entity18 fighters			1
he attacks the ' catastrophic complacency ' of @entity21 politicians over the humanitarian crisis , accusing them of policy paralysis			1
resisting strong pressure to recall @entity60 , the @entity58 said last night there were no plans to make the @entity4 operation in @entity8 more than a humanitarian mission			1
however , writing in the @entity1 today , dr @entity2 says this approach is unsustainable – and that aid on its own is not enough to help defenceless @entity8			1
instead of leadership , he says there has been a vacuum that has allowed @entity18 to press ahead with a campaign of mass slaughter			1
and he warns that unless the maniacs are vanquished , young jihadis could flood to @entity4 to bring death and mayhem to our shores			2
in his hard - hitting article , the former minister calls on mr @entity10 to send the @entity47 to join @entity5 jets in blitzing @entity18 fighters – and says we should also supply arms to @entity53 fighters			1
apilot based at @entity31 entering a @entity29 prior to taking off for the reconnaissance mission over @entity8 an engineer preparing the @entity86 pod on a @entity29 for its reconnaissance mission over @entity8 @entity2 has called on the prime minister to sanction the use of our military to protect civilians from ' barbaric ' islamic state fighters ( pictured ) if @entity47 helicopters fly into action in @entity8 – even on a humanitarian mission – it represents a considerable upping of the stakes			1
the heavy - duty twin - rotor aircraft can transport tons of aid and airlift out dozens of refugees but not without significant risk			2
their advantage over high - flying cargo planes is that they can land , but this makes them vulnerable to attack			2
crews would also face having to fend off hundreds of desperate refugees threatening to overload the helicopter , as has been happening with @entity8 @entity116 aircraft this week			2
humanitarian crisis : displaced people from the minority @entity49 sect , fleeing violence from forces loyal to the @entity18 in @entity123 town , walk towards the @entity125 border the use of @entity127 would also raise the prospect of @entity4 forces effectively becoming involved in combat , given that they might have to defend themselves against an attack by @entity93 fanatics who would relish the chance of downing a @entity4 helicopter			1
as the spectre of ' mission creep ' was raised again yesterday , three @entity138 warplanes jetted from @entity31 in @entity141 for @entity34 , from where they will fly sorties over @entity8			0
between six and eight @entity36 will be equipped with reconnaissance pods used to scan the landscape distinguishing friend from foe , to identity where humanitarian supplies should be dropped			0
mr @entity10 , who has faced criticism for remaining on holiday in @entity152 as the crisis unfolded , returns from his holiday later today and will be back at his desk at @entity45 tomorrow			0
the government has faced growing criticism over its apparent lack of a coherent strategy on how @entity4 is to respond to the @entity8 crisis			1
one of the country 's most senior generals yesterday accused the ' commitment - phobic ' government of being ' terrified ' of intervening in the @entity8 crisis before next year 's general election			1
general sir @entity165 told the @entity166 : ' the longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate , the more dangerous the situation is going to become			0
' yesterday both @entity171 mp @entity170 and @entity173 's @entity172 wrote to the prime minister to demand he recall @entity60 to discuss possible @entity4 action in @entity176 his letter to @entity45 , mr @entity170 said stronger action was needed against @entity18 because ' these people want a holocaust of everyone who does not share their brutal ideology '			1
former @entity183 leader sir @entity183 said ' it would be in the interests of the government ' to have @entity60 recalled			1
foreign secretary @entity187 again dismissed calls for military assistance yesterday			1
a @entity191 spokesman said : ' as part of our efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in @entity8 , we are sending a small number of @entity47 helicopters to the region for use if we decide we need further humanitarian relief options			0
' we have also agreed to transport from other contributing states some critical military re-supplies for the @entity53 forces , so that they can provide effective protection from @entity27 for the huge number of refugees now in @entity207 , and humanitarian operations			1
' dr foxwarns a fundamentalist caliphate would be a magnet for jihadists around the world isis are @entity4 's enemy and have to be defeated by @entity2 , former @entity171 defence secretary for months , we have watched isis tighten their grip on the territory and people they control			1
they are well funded and well organised , strengthened by the chaos of the civil war in @entity125 and the actions of the disastrous @entity223 government in @entity8			1
they are one of the most barbaric and savage forces we have witnessed in the world since the genocide in @entity228			1
they pose a direct threat to the lives of civ - ilians who oppose their hardline religious views , they destabilise further an already volatile region and they will increasingly create young jihadists who will find their way to countries like our own			0
the idea that this is not our problem is wishful thinking at best , and cata - strophic complacency at worst			1
yet , in the face of all the evidence , there has been policy paralysis in the @entity250			0
where we have needed leadership we have found a vacuum			0
certainly , public opinion is split over any military action , understandable after the protracted conflict in @entity8 , but this is an occasion where we need to lead public opinion , not follow it			2
the consequences of allowing an extremist caliphate to be formed , stretching from @entity125 to the borders of @entity261 , are almost unthinkable			0
not only would it bring further horrors to innocent people , the likes of which we have seen graphically in the last few weeks , but it would potentially risk a full - scale @entity265 conflict with profound economic consequences for us all			0
those who say we should have nothing to do with the conflicts in the region might want to think about the effect on oil prices in the event of a clash involving @entity261 or @entity279			0
if the global economy were to suffer another oil shock , the price , for the poorest countries in particular , could be disastrously high			0
perhaps worst of all , a fundamentalist caliphate would be a magnet for jihadists around the world and it would soon be used as a base from which to export terrorism and extremism			0
so , we need to be clear , @entity27 are our enemy and need to be defeated			0
either we use our military power to degrade and diminish their military capabilities , so that the countries in the region are able to deal with them effectively , or we can ensure that we supply our allies in the region with the equipment and knowledge they need to do the job themselves			2
in all likelihood , we will have to do both			0
a half - hearted and ineffectual intervention will only increase the suffering of those caught up in the nightmare of @entity27 and increase the risk of a widening crisis			0
the @entity5 government has made a belated , but welcome , decision to use @entity5 air power to hit @entity27 bases			2
we should be willing to do the same if asked			0
sending humanitarian aid is right but if we are leaving the vulnerable unprotected from the military terror of the @entity27 forces then our help is superficial			2
there are , of course , risks involved with any outside intervention , but those who think that we will be left alone by the fanatics if we are not seen to be taking a side are fooling themselves			0
in the @entity250 , we need to understand that @entity328 fundamentalists hate us , not just because of what we do , but because of who we are			0
our systems of law and government and our concept of rights , especially women ’s rights , and religious tolerance undermine their very existence in the long - term			2
there is not going to be a cost - free option available in a situation which has already been allowed to continue for too long , but the cost of failing to act could be higher still .			0
