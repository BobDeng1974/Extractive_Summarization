blinded : @entity0 was hit by debris after a railway detonator he and friends put on a fire exploded a schoolboy has been blinded in one eye after an unmarked box of railway detonators he and some friends had put on a fire exploded			1
@entity0 , 15 , entered a railway depot through a broken fence with two older boys and took some rubbish from a skip to build the bonfire			1
when the unmarked box – filled with detonators used to warn maintenance crews a train is approaching in thick fog – started to explode as the fire started , he tried to kick it away from the flames			1
debris flew into his face and he was taken to hospital where surgeons operated to remove the fragments			1
however , they later told his parents @entity31 , 45 , and @entity32 , 49 , that he had been blinded in his right eye			1
@entity34 are planning to speak to @entity0 when he has had time to recover			1
officers have already arrested two 17 - year - old boys on suspicion of theft and interviewed them before releasing them on bail			1
mr and mrs @entity41 yesterday criticised @entity42 for leaving explosive devices where children could find them			1
mother - of - four mrs @entity41 said : ‘ @entity0 is not the kind of boy who would go looking for trouble			1
‘ he ’s predicted straight a-grades at school – we were just in shock when we were told about his injuries			1
‘ the doctors have told him he will never be able to see out of his right eye again			1
’ mr @entity0 , a builder , added : ‘ @entity42 has never had a problem with the kids grabbing crates from there before			1
scene : the remains on the fire could be seen at the skate park near @entity67 , @entity68 theft : the teenager and two friends had thrown the box of explosives , used as railway warning signals , onto a bonfire ( file picture ) ‘ now my boy ’s been injured they ’re accusing them of stealing explosives			1
why were the detonators there in the first place ? ’ @entity0 was out playing with the older boys near his home in @entity67 , @entity68 , on saturday night			2
he was discharged from @entity86 the following day			2
speaking afterwards , with a patch over his eye , he said : ‘ we were building a small fire and just dumped a few bits from the skip on there			2
one thing was an unmarked box but before we knew it , it started exploding			2
‘ we tried to spray the fire with water and i tried to kick the box off the heat but that was when i got hit in the face			2
now i ’m going to be paying the price for that mistake for the rest of my life			2
’ railways detonators are used as a warning signal for train drivers			2
about the size of a large coin , the detonator is strapped to the top of the rail with metal straps			2
when a train wheel passes over it , the device emits a loud bang to warn drivers about a number of things including : dense fog , a train stopped on the line ahead or ongoing engineering works			0
they are also used by signallers when they need to stop approaching trains in an emergency the explosives can be dangerous if handled in the wrong way - throwing them onto bonfires for example			0
large pools of blood could still be seen splattered across the concrete yesterday at the skate park where the teenagers built the fire			1
skateboarders in the area described how the boys walked through a gap in a nearby fence which had been there for ‘ months , probably years ’			0
one said : ‘ i do n’t know why they did n’t fix the fence before			0
‘ what he did was stupid but why the hell were they dumping detonators yards from a skate park ? ’ the damaged fence was fixed within hours of the accident			0
@entity158 detonators are yellow disks of metal just over two inches in diameter and less than half an inch deep			0
maintenance workers line up three on the track when visibility is poor			0
they are triggered when a train runs over them , making a loud but harmless bang to warn them of the approaching danger			0
transport police said 31 had been recovered			0
it is not known how many were triggered by the fire			0
a spokesman said : ‘ they are very difficult to set off			0
it takes the weight and impact of a train to set them off – but putting them in a bonfire is a different matter			0
‘ they do n’t fragment much			0
it is possible the boy ’s injuries were caused by something such as splinters that came out of the fire			0
’ detective constable @entity190 added : ‘ this is a tragic accident which has had very serious consequences for the youngster involved			0

teenagers were able to access @entity42 depot where explosive were through broken railing
