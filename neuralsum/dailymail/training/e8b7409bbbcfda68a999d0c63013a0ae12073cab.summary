by @entity0 @entity1 confirmed today he has had dinner with ' significant ' @entity4 donors at his flat in @entity6 on three occasions since becoming prime minister , as well as at a post-election dinner in no 10 in 2010			1
the prime minister said he will publish details of the meetings later today , and will order the party to publish details of all meals with donors on a quarterly basis			0
but he insisted that most of the guests at the dinners were long - standing acquaintances and former @entity4 co-treasurer @entity20 had never recommended that a donor should be invited			2
mr @entity20 was forced to resign his post on saturday after the @entity23 published secret recordings in which he told undercover reporters that they could secure meetings with senior ministers by giving the party money			1
scroll down to hear @entity1 's reaction close relationship : @entity4 treasurer @entity20 , left , boasted that he could give donors private access to @entity1 , right mr @entity1 said he had broadened the @entity34 ’ funding base since becoming leader , but there was still an ' urgent need ' for wider reform in @entity41 politics			1
' i am ready to impose a cap on individual political donations of £ 50,000 without any further need for state funding			0
' but to be fair this must apply equally to trade unions as well as private individuals or businesses			0
' government sources were forced to admit the existence of the intimate dinners after mr @entity20 was secretly filmed boasting that he could provide direct access to the prime minister for ‘ @entity57 ’ donors			1
but a source said it was ‘ simply untrue ’ to suggest donors were able to buy access or influence , adding : ‘ this was never in exchange for anything			2
' the @entity55 is entitled to meet with people even if they happen to have given money to the party			2
’ but the revelation threatened to bring the ‘ cash for access ’ scandal to the very heart of @entity6			1
mr @entity20 , a multi-millionaire who was forced to quit as soon as the revelations became public , suggested major donors who agreed to give £ 250,000 a year would have their concerns and ideas ‘ fed in ’ directly to the @entity6 policy unit			1
he told undercover reporters posing as wealthy foreign businessmen that they could expect to attend dinners with mr @entity1 , chancellor @entity81 and senior ministers if they donated enough cash			1
' business deals ' : mr @entity20 was secretly filmed telling undercover reporters he could arrange private meetings with senior conservatives he went on : ‘ some of our bigger donors have been for dinner in no 10 @entity6 , in the prime minister ’s private apartment , with @entity92			1
’ @entity4 donors invited for dinner are believed to have included billionaire @entity95 businessman @entity94 , himself a former party treasurer			0
government sources last night said no donation had been offered or accepted , and claimed that mr @entity20 was acting as a rogue operator whose boasts broke party rules			1
but the revelation that the prime minister has hosted private dinners for donors could leave him open to accusations that he has breached his own ministerial code , which requires ministers to avoid any activity that could be perceived as improper			2
in another ominous twist , the @entity111 were last night asked to investigate suggestions that mr @entity20 or others may have accepted donations from wealthy foreigners – which is illegal under @entity41 electoral law			2
mr @entity1 described mr @entity20 ’s comments as ‘ completely unacceptable ’ , adding : ‘ this is not the way that we raise money in the @entity4 , it should n’t have happened			1
’ the prime minister said he was ordering an internal inquiry into the affair			0
sources initially suggested it would be led by the party ’s co-chairman @entity130 , who recruited mr @entity20 and was effectively his line manager			1
but the idea was dropped after critics questioned whether @entity130 , mr @entity1 ’s former tennis partner and closest friend in politics , was sufficiently independent			1
appalled : sir @entity137 , chair of the @entity138 , said the revelations were ' not an isolated incident ' while @entity142 leader @entity141 called the news ' disturbing ' @entity142 called for an independent inquiry and will today press mr @entity1 to make a full commons statement on the affair			1
@entity141 said : ‘ these are very disturbing revelations			2
the @entity4 has been seeking cash in exchange for access to the prime minister and @entity81 and indeed influence over policy making			2
‘ it ’s no way to run a government or a political party and these allegations ca n’t be swept under the carpet			0
there needs to be a proper independent investigation into whether influence was sought , what influence was gained and what impact it had			0
’ sir @entity137 , chairman of the @entity138 , last night warned that the revelations were ‘ not an isolated incident ’			0
he added : ‘ as long as we have a system in which the main political parties are reliant on very large donations from very rich individuals – or organisations , in the case of the @entity142 – then events of this kind are almost bound to happen			0
‘ it is a cancer which needs to be addressed			0
’ @entity6 last night said it was fast - tracking cross-party talks on reform of party funding			0
a source said : ‘ clearly the current set - up is not ideal			0
’ the revelations are deeply embarrassing for mr @entity1 , who pledged two years ago to crack down on the shadowy world of lobbying			1
the existence of secret dinners with donors also undermines the @entity186 ’s much - vaunted transparency drive , which allows the public to see who ministers have met in their official capacity			0
@entity1 : register of ' donor dinner guests ' to be published ... from now on .			0

@entity20 offered access to @entity55 in return for cash
he suggested donors who agreed to give £ 250,000 a year would have their ideas ' fed in ' to @entity6
undercover reporters told they could dine with mr @entity1 , @entity81 and senior ministers
' bigger donors ' visited @entity1 and wife @entity92 's apartment , he claimed
mr @entity141 called revelations ' disturbing '
mr @entity1 said @entity20 's comments were ' unacceptable '
