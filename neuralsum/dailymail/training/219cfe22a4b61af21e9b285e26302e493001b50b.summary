by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 22:14 est , 6 december 2012 the death toll from cancer has fallen over the past decade , official figures showed yesterday			1
earlier diagnosis and better treatment have seen the rate drop by an average of 9.5 per cent since 2001			2
a decline in smoking was also cited as a factor because tobacco causes cancer of the lung as well as other forms of the disease including breast , bowel , liver , throat and mouth			2
the chance of dying from cancer is still greater however in @entity23 than in some other @entity25 countries			1
a recent report has shown that the number of women dying from ovarian cancer - one of the most aggressive types - had fallen by a quarter in a decade among women the death rates are the third highest in @entity33 and worse than in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
the 2011 figures from the @entity38 show that death rates for men have fallen by 10.9 per cent since 2001			2
on average , 204 die from cancer per 100,000 of the male population each year			1
in 2001 the toll was 229			0
in women the rates have fallen by 7.5 per cent , from 161 to 149 deaths per 100,000 each year			1
the average decline for both sexes was 9.5 per cent			0
‘ the good news is that as individuals our risk of dying from the disease has fallen , ’ said @entity49 , head of statistics at @entity51			0
‘ the reduction in people smoking has helped hugely for many cancers , and we ’re better at diagnosing some cancers earlier			1
we ’re also better at treating many cancers , with surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy , as well as developing more tailored personalised medicine			0
’ countries with the worst cancer survival rates in @entity33 health secretary @entity68 said : ‘ it is encouraging to see figures moving in the right direction with overall deaths falling , but there is more we can do to make sure that our cancer services are world class and that @entity77 patients receive the best treatment available			1
’ of the ten countries included in @entity33 , only @entity79 and @entity80 recorded higher figures for cancer death rates in women			0
death rates for men were fifth out of the ten states across @entity33			0
around 320,500 @entity23 are diagnosed with cancer a year and 157,000 patients die			1
breast : 48788 lung : 41428 bowel : 41142 prostate : 40841 latest annual figures ( 2009 ) from @entity51 last month a report showed that the number of women dying from ovarian cancer – one of the most aggressive types – had fallen by a quarter in a decade			0
death rates have always been higher in men than women and researchers believe this may be because they have poorer lifestyles			0
in 2009 , figures from @entity51 showed that men were 60 per cent more likely to get cancer and 70 per cent more likely to die from @entity108 from the charity said that there was no obvious reason except that men tended to be less ‘ health conscious ’			1
they also said it may be that men had a ‘ stiff upper lip ’ and were more reluctant to see their gp if unwell .			0

around 320,000 people @entity23 are diagnosed each year
around half die , but patients are six times more likely to survive than 40 years *ago*
