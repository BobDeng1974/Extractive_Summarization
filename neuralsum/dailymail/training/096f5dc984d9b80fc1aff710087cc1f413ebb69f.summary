by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 22 april 2013 it 's unlikely you 'll hear a little girl utter the words , ' when i grow up , i want to be a funeral director			1
' but @entity7 , 29 , who has herself embarked on the morbid career , thinks more women should break into the male dominated profession			1
' women are in the minority in this industry			0
while women often care for the dying as nurses , there 's a perception that when you die it 's then the ' @entity21 ' who should come in and sort everything out , ' she told the @entity23			2
career change : @entity7 gave up a job at @entity26 to set up her own funeral service ' there 's a perception that men are better at coping with death because they can shut down their emotions			1
but it 's also important to be in touch with feelings and to be caring - both for helping take care of someone 's body and helping their bereaved family			2
' @entity7 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , gave up a career as deputy director and expert at @entity26 to set up her own business , @entity7 's funerals , last june			1
her change in career was influenced by her work volunteering at the @entity51 and @entity52			0
she explains : ' i wanted to do a job that was more important , where i could help people			2
the way we have dealt with death and dying has n't changed for centuries			0
i want to give people more choice and support			0
' no ' @entity21 ' : @entity7 takes a more feminine approach with no black hearses or black coffins she added that she has ' no fascination with death ' as her work is really about ' helping the living ' by supporting grieving families			1
nevertheless , of course she does also have to work with death bodies in the mortuary on a regular basis and prepare them for cremation			0
so how does she cope with this aspect of the job ? ' before i did the job i had never seen a dead body and , like most people , thought of it as something scary			2
but i quickly got used to it			0
it 's not scary , it 's the person who you love whose heart has stopped beating , ' she said			2
' the job has made me hold the people i love tighter and appreciate them more ' dealing with grieving families daily must also be harrowing but @entity7 said she finds the work ' sad but fulfilling '			1
she added : ' with this job i get a tangible sense of helping people			2
it 's meaningful , wonderful work			1
' if she ever has a particularly difficult day , she said she unwinds by talking about it to husband @entity105 , 29 , and going for walks			2
she added that her work has changed her own outlook on life			0
' it has made me hold the people i love tighter			0
it has made me appreciate them more and not to dwell on small things , hold grudges or let arguments lie unresolved			0
' rewarding work : the funeral director said she no longer finds dead bodies ' scary ' @entity7 said is putting feminine touches into her business by doing away with black hearses and black coffins			1
instead , her vehicles are white and covered in poppies and they use coffins made from willow and bamboo			0
she believes her approach is more personal and meaningful , doing away with the pomp for a simpler and modern cremation where the families of the bereaved can call the shots			1
as many people do n't like to think about death , @entity7 said when she reveals her profession it can often be a conversation - stopper at parties			1
she spoke to the @entity23 to mark the release of a new film released this friday , @entity142 , starring @entity143 , that is set in a funeral home			1
she hopes such films can get people talking more openly about death			0
' it is something we all have to face eventually , ' she said			0
' it is important to think about what you want to happen to yourself and the people you love when they die			0
' morbid subject : @entity143 's new film @entity142 is set in a funeral home and @entity7 hopes it will make people talk about death more			1

@entity7 , 29 , set up her own funeral business last year
she said she enjoys the job because it 's ' sad but meaningful '
she tries to offer a modern approach without the ' pomp ' and ' men in black '
