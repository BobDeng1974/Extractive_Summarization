@entity0 will make a new goalscorer his @entity3 priority in january as he bids to resurrect @entity5 ’s season			1
the @entity6 have lost three matches on the spin , including the @entity10 quarter - final at @entity11 and sunday ’s @entity12			1
they have scored just once in that period – @entity17 ’s consolation in the 4 - 1 defeat at @entity19 – and while the young @entity20 has been a positive for @entity0 , he remains concerned about the condition of seven - goal top scorer @entity22			1
@entity5 manager @entity0 remains concerned about the condition of top scorer @entity22 and that will see @entity0 ask owner @entity25 to open his cheque book when the transfer window reopens in the @entity28			1
‘ i think we are still a striker light , ’ he said			1
‘ even when @entity31 returns , i think we ’ll need another one			2
‘ @entity22 - even taking away the flu - he is still not right			1
he ’s not 100 per cent and you could see that in the way he plays			2
that ’s something we need to look at			2
we need another striker if we can get one			1
’ @entity0 will make a new goalscorer his no 1 priority in january as he bids to resurrect @entity5 ’s season @entity42 is @entity44 ’s top target but @entity45 are determined to keep their star striker until the end of the season , even though his contract expires in the summer			1
for now , 21 - year - old @entity17 will continue to lead the line			2
the £ 1.5million former @entity51 forward has scored four from eight starts , and @entity0 has been pleasantly surprised by his impact			1
‘ if you said at start of the year he would be in this position i would have said that was unlikely , ’ said @entity0 , who will start with @entity17 at @entity44 on @entity54			1
‘ his physical improvement has been immense			2
he was already technically accomplished , which was obvious when he arrived			2
his physical attributes and mentality in games have improved massively			0
‘ he enjoys playing against top opposition as much as lesser opposition and that bodes well			1
we have been absolutely reliant on him in a lot of ways			0
‘ i said at the start of the year we were a striker light and we really needed someone to come through and help us out - and he ’s done that			1
’ @entity42 is @entity5 's top target but @entity45 are determined to keep him until the end of the season @entity17 , who has scored four goals from eight stars , will continue to lead the line for the @entity6 @entity0 , though , is not concerned by @entity17 ’s slight frame			1
‘ i do n’t want him to be a big brute of a player , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s never going to be that , but there is a strength in holding players off the ball and it ’s something @entity88 needs to gain			0
‘ when he first arrived he looked too light in training and was knocked off the ball far too easily			0
he did n’t hold his own in tight areas , but now he does in training and in matches			0
‘ he ’s not going to grow much bigger and i do n’t want him to			0
that wiry strength is a big part of his game			0
‘ he did a couple of tricks on sunday that i do n’t think anybody else on the pitch could have produced			0
his feet are so fast			0
he ’s been a real asset			0
