by @entity0 , political editor for @entity1 labour leader @entity2 tonight faces revolt from his @entity5 @entity4 over his refusal to bar @entity8 mps from voting on policies which only apply south of the border			1
former cabinet ministers @entity12 and @entity13 have formed a new group dubbed @entity15 to challenge the party leadership 's refusal to admit it is ' unfair ' for @entity8 to vote on @entity5 matters			1
mr @entity2 is under pressure for refusing to back home rule for @entity5 , and @entity22 said it should form part of the response to @entity8 rejecting independence in last week 's referendum			1
former labour cabinet ministers @entity13 ( left ) and @entity12 have challenged the party leadership 's refusal to say it is unfair for @entity8 mps to vote on @entity5 laws the @entity15 leadership is struggling to hold the line on the @entity5 votes issue , insisting it could ' drive our country apart '			1
mr @entity22 has said reform at the @entity39 should be carried out ' in tandem ' with the further devolution to @entity42 promised by the leaders of the three main @entity45 parties in the final days of the referendum campaign			2
mr @entity2 's chances of being able to form a @entity39 majority after the next general election are likely to depend on the votes of @entity8 mps			1
he has called for constitutional convention to consider wider issues of reform , and was asked 13 times by the @entity55 's @entity54 whether he backed the idea of ' @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ' , but refused to give a direct answer			1
to add to the sense of confusion , @entity15 deputy leader @entity59 tonight told @entity62 : ' we do have to recognise there 's an anomaly and look at different ways we can address that			1
' now it has emerged that @entity4 in @entity5 have formed a rebel bloc to challenge the leadership			1
former culture secretary mr @entity12 told the @entity71 : ' our leadership has to be much clearer that there 's a problem that needs addressing			2
' they 've very good at talking about devolution , they 're very good at talking about powers to communities and local government			2
' we need to be absolutely crystal clear there is an imbalance and unfairness in our constitutional settlement			0
' shadow chancellor @entity86 and @entity15 leader @entity2 have refused to say it is unfair for @entity8 to vote on policies which do not affect their constituencies @entity90 , the @entity91 , said @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ' could not be avoided ' commons leader @entity90 tonight fired a warning at @entity15 that banning @entity8 mps from voting on @entity5 laws ' can not now be avoided '			1
the former foreign secretary , emerging from a summit with @entity98 mps at the prime minister 's countryside retreat at @entity101 , said ' @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ' was ' something we have to face up to ' in the wake of the @entity8 independence referendum			1
he said handing more devolved powers to @entity42 had to go hand in hand with less @entity8 influence over @entity5 laws			1
but mr @entity90 held out an olive branch to the @entity111 â€“ insisting that it would be prepared to hold talks on the issue in the coming weeks			0
he said : ' we will be open to discussions - of course we will be - with the @entity111 and other parties as well			0
' however he stressed that the issue had to be dealt with and that if the @entity45 parties - including the @entity121 - could not reach agreement they would have to set out their rival positions at the general election in may			2
he said : ' this issue of fairness for @entity5 - as well as for @entity8 , @entity127 and @entity128 - i think is one that can not now be avoided			2
that is now something we have to face up to			0
' it has been discussed for a very long time			0
the time has now come to make some decisions about this			0
' mr @entity12 , who attended the inaugural meeting of the @entity5 @entity111 , with mps , council leaders and representatives of the church and civic leaders , added : ' we have to acknowledge an unfairness where @entity8 mps vote on exclusively @entity5 matters			1
the question as to whether this is unfair has to be a ' yes '			0
' however , today shadow chancellor @entity86 dodged questions about whether the system is fair six times			0
he told @entity153 only that he wanted a ' fairer ' solution to the problem , but said : ' i think @entity22 is just trying to dupe people with an idea that he 's got some easy , quick political fix which him and @entity90 and @entity160 sorted out			0
' you ca n't play political games with our constitution			0
i want fairness , but i 'm not going to say there 's an easy and fair solution to the question you 're raising			0
' he continued that the prime minister was ' playing fast and loose with the whole of our @entity173 '			0
speaking at a fringe event in @entity177 , @entity15 mp @entity175 said mr @entity2 has to come out with substantial ' road map ' to @entity5 devolution or he 's in ' real trouble '			2
he added : ' if he does n't address it tomorrow then he 's got a real problem ... then we are really on the back foot			0
' why we could n't have had a good offer ready ... just beggar 's belief in my opinion			0
' meanwhile mr @entity13 , a former communities secretary , said the offer more powers to @entity8 had to mean more autonomy for @entity5 too			1
he told @entity191 : ' i think there 's no doubt @entity5 needs to decide what it wants and that means you have to find a way that laws just affecting @entity5 have the consent of @entity5 mps			1
' so i do n't have a problem with the principle that [ says ] as the powers of the @entity42 increase the role of @entity8 mps in @entity5 affairs is bound to decrease			1
' @entity208 mayor @entity207 said proposals to hand sweeping new powers to @entity211 were being introduced at a ' blisteringly fast ' pace - despite claims by @entity8 nationalists that @entity45 was ' reneging ' on its campaign promises			2
but he warned that the ' basic unfairness ' of allowing @entity8 mps to vote on legislation which does not apply north of the border needed addressing			1
he said this ' can be done while keeping the @entity173 together ' , but added : ' it is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight			0
' prime minister @entity22 mr @entity22 said the ' @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ' measure should be introduced ' in tandem ' with handing new powers to @entity42			2
the @entity22 today held talks with senior backbenchers at his official country retreat , @entity101 , to win support for his proposal .			0
