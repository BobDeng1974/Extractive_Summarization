@entity0 won their first @entity2 warm - up with relative ease at @entity4 with @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 on the scoresheet			1
but who performed and who should be looking over their shoulder ? @entity12 gives his ratings			0
largely untroubled and scored with an excellent header - 6.5 definite starter composed : @entity6 was untroubled and made sure of victory by scoring the second goal @entity7 : looks comfortable at this level now			0
knows , if he 's fit , he plays and benefitting as a result - 6.5 definite starter @entity38 : safe pair of hands down the left and delivery from wide will be an asset			0
two assists - 7 definite starter @entity46 : assumed his club ' quarterback ' role and was yet again @entity0 's heartbeat			0
booked - 6.5 definite starter @entity51 : showed great energy in midfield , but still question marks about his quality on the ball - 6.5 in contention willing : @entity51 showed great energy but there are question marks over his ability @entity61 : showed in flashes why he 's being touted as a starter for the opener against @entity66 - 6.5 in contention @entity68 : being positioned just behind @entity5 suits his game , but he must maintain his goal threat - 6.5 definite starter @entity71 : looked dangerous at times , but the @entity74 man does n't do enough when in possession - 6 on the bench @entity5 : led the line and marked the occasion with a brilliant opener			1
has the potential to be @entity0 's main man - 7.5 definite starter on the bench : @entity71 looked dangerous at times but should not start against @entity66 @entity84 ( for @entity46 64 ) : got 25 much needed minutes under his belt and will be better for it - 6 in contention @entity88 ( for @entity68 66 ) : tipped to be @entity0 's wild card in @entity28			1
added urgency into @entity0 's attack - 6.5 in contention @entity93 ( for @entity61 73 ) : what you see is what you get			1
will be important in games against top opposition - 6 in contention wild card : @entity88 but be @entity0 's secret weapon in @entity28 @entity103 ( for @entity7 73 ) : in the squad for his versatility			1
slotted in comfortably at centre - back - 6 on the bench @entity108 ( for @entity109 76 ) : big night for the youngster on his @entity0 debut			0
one for the future - 6 on the bench @entity113 ( for @entity5 , 83 ) : has the ability to break teams down with a flash of brilliance			2
a weapon as a sub - 5 on the bench subs not used : @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity113 , @entity125 , @entity126 bigger challenges lay ahead but he 'll be happy with the result , if not completely by the performance - 7 steady : @entity15 will be happy with the result if not entirely by the performance @entity132 5 ; @entity133 6 ( @entity134 78 ) , @entity135 6 ( @entity136 68 ) , @entity137 6 , @entity138 6 ; @entity139 6 , @entity140 6 , @entity141 6.5 ; @entity142 5 ( @entity143 65 , 5 ) , @entity144 6 ( @entity145 , 87 ) ; ramirez 6 ( @entity146 , 60 , 5 ) subs : @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 @entity152 - his side certainly did n't come to make up the numbers			2
provided @entity0 with a decent test - 6.5 @entity156 ( @entity157 ) : did n't endear himself to the home supporters by booking captain @entity46 for a meaty first half tackle - 6			0

@entity5 led the line brilliantly and capped performance with a goal
@entity68 was good in a *deeper* role but needs to be a goal threat
@entity71 looked dangerous at times but does n't do enough
@entity88 added urgency when he was *introduced*
