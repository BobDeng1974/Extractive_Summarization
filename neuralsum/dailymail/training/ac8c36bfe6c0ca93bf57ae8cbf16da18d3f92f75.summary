a trio of @entity2 engineering students may have found a way to thwart even the best bicycle thief with the world 's first ' unstealable bike			2
' the design , called the @entity8 , looks like most bikes on an average city street , but the bottom tube of the frame can be split into two parts and wrapped around a pole			1
it is then secured to the pole or tree using the seat post to connect the arms , and locked shut			1
he created the bike with partners @entity37 and @entity39			2
' sadly , @entity39 had two of his bikes stolen in a short period of tim , @entity40 added			2
' a few years ago we took an engineering design class at @entity46 here in @entity2 and were asked to solve a problem to an actual commute			0
using @entity39 ’ experience as a starting point we started to throw ideas to the table trying to solve this problem , and finally came up with something very similar to what we have today			0
' the company is working on prototypes that will connect combination locks to your smartphone via @entity62			0
@entity63 poses for a picture with the @entity65 , a prototype for an unstealable bike at a bicycle trail in @entity69 , @entity2 while they call it the world 's first unstealable bike , critics say the lock could be picked or the bike easily destroyed			1
' remember how people used to open those ubiquitous cylinder locks with a @entity79 pen ? any lock can be picked and the bike stolen , ' said @entity82 , the managing editor at the website @entity84			1
' over at @entity86 , the one bike site that i have seen cover this , a commentator noted that one good kick on that seat post and it will be dented , making the bike unrideable for the owner as well			1
' thieves might also be happy simply to get the handlebars or front wheel			0
' if we were n’t doing something as disruptive as this , or something that people are n’t interested in , we would n’t receive any critics , and believe me when i say we ’ve had lots of them mainly referring to the same ‘ what if i cut the seat post ’ question , '' @entity40 shot back			0
' we try to learn and improve our project with every critic , and we are soon to release a video in which we probably answer those kind of questions			0
' the bike should retail for between $ 400 and $ 1,000 when it hits the market early next year .			1

design , called the @entity8 , splits into two parts to lock around a tree or pole
will go on sale early next year for between $ 400 and $ 1,000
critics claim the bike could be stolen by a good *lockpick* or simply *wrecked*
