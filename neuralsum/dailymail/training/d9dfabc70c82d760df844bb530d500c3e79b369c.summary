the @entity6 exposes the risks of low carb diets for children
82 per cent of parents give their children the same meals when they were going on diets themselves
45 per cent of these parents limited the bread their children ate , and 17 per cent cut carbs from their children ’s diet altogether
this can *hinder* *optimum* brain development and lead to depression in children
