proving a smartphone camera can be used just about anything , a team of thermal imaging experts has created an @entity14 case fitted with a tiny heat - seeking device			1
called @entity16 , the case and camera can be used to find visible , and hidden , heat sources and , coupled with an additional visible camera , even lets users see in total darkness			1
it can be used see in total darkness , through smoke , view wildlife , and find invisible heat and damp spots			1
this could help homeowners identify where drafts are coming from , or find mould and wet spots before they appear launch date : expected in @entity38 @entity39 : $ 350 ( around £ 212 ) scene range temperature : 0 ° c to 100 ° c weight : 3.2 ounces ( 90grams ) dimensions : 5.5 inches x 2.4 inches x 85 inches battery capacity : 1400 ma / h sensitivity : temperature differences as small as 0.1 ° c this can help homeowners identify where drafts are coming from , or find mould and wet spots before they appear , for example			1
additionally , it could be used to identify heat loss around windows and doors and spot overloaded electrical connections and circuits			0
the case was created by @entity61 - based @entity60			0
users fit their phone into the device , download the @entity66 app and then point the camera at everyday objects			2
the camera uses what 's called ' multi-spectral dynamic imaging ' to create high - quality thermal pictures in real - time			0
these images can be seen on the @entity14 's screen , pictured the camera can detect minimal changes in temperature of just 0.1 ° c to show which areas of an object are hotter , or cooler , than others			1
as seen in the face and body of this cat			0
as well as showing heat spots , the camera can be used at night to see in total darkness and see through smoke the case also comes with a visible camera and is charged by usb			2
it is expected to cost around $ 350 ( £ 212 ) when it goes on sale in the @entity38 the camera uses what ’s called ‘ multi-spectral dynamic imaging ’ to create high - quality thermal pictures in real - time			2
these images can be seen on the @entity14 ’s screen and the app can also give temperature readings of the objects in the pictures			1
it can even detect minimal changes in temperature of just 0.1 ° c to show which areas of an object are hotter , or cooler , than others			1
as well as showing heat spots , the camera can be used at night to see in total darkness and see through smoke and mist			2
it will additionally find invisible heat sources and cool spots that are naked to the human eye			1
elsewhere , wildlife enthusiasts can use the camera to track animals in daylight , and at night			0
the case is fitted with its own battery and will last for up to two hours continuous use on a single charge			0
however , the technology still comes at a price - the case is expected to cost around $ 350 ( £ 212 ) when it goes on sale in the @entity38			0
the first model was created for @entity14 and @entity132 models but an @entity134 version is expected later this year .			0

@entity16 is an @entity14 case with a small thermal camera fitted on the back
the camera can detect minimum temperature changes of just 0.1 ° c
temperature readings are *displayed* on the phone ’s screen via an app
it lets users see in darkness and find invisible heat and damp spots
this helps homeowners check for drafts and find mould before it appears
