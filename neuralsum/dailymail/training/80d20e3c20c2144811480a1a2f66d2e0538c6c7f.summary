by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 is just 19 and had only run five 400 metre races this season before he took an astonishing 0.83 seconds off his personal best to become the quickest @entity6 athlete of 2014 over a lap of the track			1
the teenager ’s 44.97sec performance to finish third at the @entity12 ’s @entity11 was also the second fastest time by a @entity14 athlete this season			1
it was a quite extraordinary breakthrough for a runner who only moved up to the 400m this season and he was rendered wide - eyed and almost speechless by his achievement			2
@entity1 was only invited to take part in the prestigious @entity22 event five days before the race and ran blind from lane eight , yet finished with such a powerful surge on saturday that there is surely more to come from this teenager			1
bright future : @entity29 reacts after finishing third in the 400m at the @entity31 @entity11 on the run : @entity1 ( far left ) finishes strongly at the @entity22 meeting at @entity34 1			1
@entity1 is currently on a gap year , but plans to go to @entity36 next year to study sports science			1
his personal best of 44.97sec was the second quickest ever by a @entity6 teenager and ranks fifth of all time at under 23 level			2
the @entity42 dedicated @entity43 to his coach , @entity45 , and his mum , and celebrated with a roast dinner at his nan ’s			0
@entity1 won bronze medals in the 200m and 4x400m at the @entity51 last year , despite having run only one relay leg for his club before joining the @entity6 quartet			1
he said he felt like ‘ a jaguar being chased by a lion ’ as he went under 45 seconds for the first time			2
‘ i surprised myself more than anything , ’ he said			0
‘ i knew i would get to 300m fine but i seemed to find a different gear so i just kept going			0
‘ it ’s my first @entity22 event and i ’ve set the bar pretty high			0
i ’ve literally just moved up from 200m			0
it was my sixth 400m of the year and it ’s unbelievable			2
’ his coach , @entity45 , was not surprised			0
@entity45 guided 1994 @entity14 400m champion @entity65 and world 4x400m champion @entity66 and knows a decent one - lap runner when he sees one			1
it was @entity45 who looked after @entity71 ’s camera when he fought his way on to the track to help injured son @entity74 complete his 400m semi-final at the @entity76			0
@entity1 won a @entity14 junior bronze medal over 200m last year , but turned heads in the 4x400m relay by running a 45.9sec split			1
he has since been selected to represent @entity81 in the relay at the @entity83 , but now hopes to secure a place in the individual 400m at the @entity86 when the selectors meet today			1
he might be the quickest @entity6 man this season but he was disqualified in the heats of the @entity90 after stepping out of his lane and will therefore be reliant on the selectors ’ discretion			2
‘ he was very angry about what happened at the trials , ’ said @entity45			0
‘ it was like he got all dressed up for the party and then someone said , “ you ca n’t come in ”			0
aiming high : @entity1 is hoping to be selected for the @entity86 after his recent displays ‘ we knew he had a quick time in him because i had n’t seen the times he was running in training since @entity65 and @entity106			1
‘ he did n’t really distribute his speed very well on saturday and he left some energy in the tank that could have been used on the back straight			0
‘ so he can go very , very fast if he keeps on working hard			0

@entity1 ran 44.97sec at the @entity31 @entity11
the 19 - year - old *'s* time is the second fastest by a @entity14 this season
he is hoping to be selected for the @entity86
