by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 05:29 est , 3 december 2012 you ca n’t have a good showbiz tale without at least one tear - jerker of a comeback in which the hero , after suffering ridicule and criticism , triumphantly returns to wipe the floor with the opposition			2
and that ’s exactly what gymnast @entity11 did on saturday ’s @entity13 when he did a @entity14 that was hailed as the best dance of the night			1
having been accused of lacking personality , producers unpacked and dusted down the ‘ acting coach ’ that they like to wheel out every series to inject a dose of luvviness into a chosen celebrity ’s performance			2
he gurned his way through the @entity14 like @entity42 on acid , even throwing in a moonwalk and a somersault for good measure			1
following the disappointment of his @entity49 the previous week and his subsequent savaging by the nasty , mean judges , it brought the house down			0
the studio audience – largely made up of middle - aged housewives – got a bit carried away , not only giving him the obligatory standing ovation but also whooping and noisily stamping their feet in appreciation			0
they ’ll all be rioting in their cul - de - sacs if @entity34 is n’t in the final in three weeks ’ time			0
always a professional : @entity64 drew on her stage experience and carried on with her routine despite partner @entity67 forgetting part of the routine powering through : @entity64 was praised for keeping calm and carrying on after @entity67 lost his way during the dance his sterling efforts earned him a 37 from the judges , including 10s from @entity76 and @entity77			1
with @entity34 stealing the show , @entity78 lost her place at the top of the leaderboard thanks to an uncharacteristically messy salsa			1
stealing more than a few of @entity87 ’s skirt - flapping , @entity90 knees - up moves , @entity64 ’s dance was nowhere near the standard we ’ve come to expect from her			1
matters were n’t helped by her dance partner @entity94 forgetting his routine halfway through , standing on the dancefloor rather like a lemon waiting for the number 14 bus to come along			1
it ’s understandable when the celebrities forget what they ’re doing but hard to summon up much sympathy for a trained professional			0
pulling all the stops out : even though @entity107 was determined not the end up in the dance - off , he was voted off despite all this , @entity110 still saw fit to award @entity64 and @entity67 ’s performance an eight out of ten – the same score he gave @entity34 ’s totally flawless @entity14			1
he was n’t the only judge behaving strangely on saturday			0
@entity77 , an excitable chap at the best of times , seemed to have really overindulged on the orange @entity116			0
not only did he actually fall off his chair , he gave viewers more innuendo and double entendres than a @entity123 film boxset			0
while the male judges may be misbehaving , @entity124 is becoming more delightful with each passing week			0
i love her constructive criticisms , quirky tips and easy banter with the panel			0
i think she ’s been a breath of fresh air for @entity13			0
after getting great scores for his @entity14 last week , @entity134 was hoping to build on that success with his @entity137 performed to @entity139 ’s @entity138			1
is it my imagination or have @entity143 themes become almost compulsory for @entity13 tangos ? unfortunately , rather than capturing the passion and drama of the dance , @entity134 looked more like he was paying his own one - man tribute to @entity150 ’s @entity149 as his legs flailed around uncontrollably			2
i can only assume that after a decade of sitting on a stool as part of @entity154 , he has a lot of leg - using time to make up for			0
it was no surprise when @entity134 ended up in the dance - off			2
it was also no surprise that he was joined there by @entity160 , following the cricketer ’s uniquely arthritic interpretation of the samba			1
‘ i am going to do everything i can to make sure i do n’t end up in the dance - off , ’ said @entity107 before performing			2
and , you ’ve got to hand it to him , he pulled all the stops out			1
he unbuttoned his shirt , slapped on the fake tan and had his dance partner @entity171 stand in front of him throughout			2
however , none of this could hide the fact that his latin dances are always a clunky , funk - free zone			0
even though @entity107 was voted off last night , he was a great competitor who ’ll be fondly remembered for his brilliant @entity179 smooth at @entity180 – if not for his ‘ dad - dancing ’ samba ... now watch @entity11 's @entity14 ...			1
