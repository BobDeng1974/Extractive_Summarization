a family butcher in the @entity2 borders has come up with a new way to eat @entity4 - inside a scotch egg			1
@entity6 and @entity7 say their snack contains 1,000 calories - and is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli - flavoured pork			1
@entity6 's @entity13 in the village of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity2 , is now even planning to sell mini egg sausages to add to shop 's @entity19 offering			1
@entity6 's @entity13 has created an unusual offering for @entity19 ; their deluxe @entity23 egg @entity24 has outdone the battered @entity25 by creating the 1,000 calorie egg and for for just £ 1.85 you too could could enjoy the @entity28 surrounded by chilli flavoured sausage meat and covered in breadcrumbs			1
@entity24 explained : ' we always try to think up something new and exciting for the time of year - we try to get our thinking caps on			2
' the 36 - year - old continued : ' we came up with the sweet chilli in the sausage meat and the egg in the middle			1
' asked what people think of his latest culinary creation mr @entity6 said : ' it 's pretty spilt			1
' however locals seem keen to try something new			2
' we made up a batch at the weekend , ' he said , ' just to see what demand was like , and it sold out pretty quickly			2
' he said around 75 per cent of the school children who come to the shop gave it the thumbs - up			2
@entity24 who has created a deluxe ' creme egg scotch egg ' for @entity19 at @entity58 pictured with co-creator @entity7 and colleague @entity59			1
the egg is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli - flavoured pork but the madcap meat - sellers are not resting on their laurels , and are working on a smaller version using a @entity66			1
mr @entity6 said : ' we 've got another idea - @entity66 sausages			1
pork sausage with whole @entity70 - the little ones coated in sugar			1
' that would work well , i think , with plain sausage meat , and letting the chocolate melt inside the sugar casings of the egg , ' he continued			1
he said a cracked black pepper and strawberry sausage produced to mark @entity80 was also a great success			2
if you do n't have the time to make chocolate from scratch , you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs			0
once your chocolate is melted , it will need to be tempered			0
the cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along , just pop your chocolate into the freezer ( no longer than 30 seconds )			0
place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it			0
keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process			0
stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature			0
bittersweet / dark chocolate should reach a temperature of @entity103 ; milk chocolate should reach @entity105 ; and white or coloured chocolate should reach @entity107			0
once the first batch has melted , add more chocolate to your bowl , stirring as you go along			0
as soon as the correct temperature is reached , start building your @entity113 layers			0
spoon some chocolate into a mould ( you can get them from @entity118 , @entity119 or @entity120 ) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould			0
you can make it as thick as you like , building each layer as the previous one cools			0
once the final layer has been built , leave aside to cool and harden before decorating .			0
