@entity0 were short of runs , and appropriate bowling skills , as @entity3 helped @entity4 to a six - wicket win in the fourth one - day international at the @entity6			1
@entity8 's breakthrough innings of 90 , in just his third odi and first in 15 months , was the major contribution in a patchy 265 all out - stand - in captain @entity11 ( 62 ) doing his best too to try to salvage a par total after choosing to bat on a dry pitch			1
but it did not quite stretch the hosts , @entity3 ( 86 ) sharing a stand of 96 with @entity18 and @entity19 finishing the job with an unbeaten 51 - farming an attack surprisingly loaded towards seam rather than spin - to keep @entity4 always just ahead of the game			0
whereas they used 36 overs of spin , @entity11 had only 10 available to him from a frontline slow bowler - and @entity3 took routine advantage , easing past his third successive half - century and hitting seven fours in all from 105 balls			0
@entity0 were flattered that victory came with only two balls to spare - and from 3 - 1 down , they must win all the remaining fixtures if they are to somehow start their @entity35 winter with a series success			2
@entity8 came in at @entity37 and scored 90 , but could n't prevent @entity0 from falling to another defeat			0

@entity3 scores 86 as @entity4 win fourth odi in @entity41
@entity0 won the toss and scored 265 after *electing* to bat first
@entity8 *top* scored with 90 as captain @entity11 added 62 @entity3 *anchored* @entity4 's *response* as they won by six wickets
@entity4 take 3 - 1 series lead with three matches to play
