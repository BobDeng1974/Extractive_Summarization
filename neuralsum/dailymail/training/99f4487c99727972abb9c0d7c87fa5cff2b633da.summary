by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 21:26 est , 1 september 2013 police in @entity2 have arrested a cat burglar accused of stealing more than $ 10 million worth of fine antique silver			1
for years , the precious pieces of silver were stolen mainly from historic mansions across the south and celebrity homes including those belonging to @entity11 and @entity12			1
in virtually every instance , no clues were left and the robber , @entity15 , 51 , would even cover his tracks , replacing panes of glass removed from windows			1
arrested : @entity15 after his arrest in @entity21 , @entity2 on monday morning			1
he was charged with burglaries in @entity23 to catch a thief : @entity25 , a retired @entity26 detective , suspected that a series of thefts in the @entity29 might be the work of an old adversary			2
he made a career out of chasing @entity15 the @entity33 in @entity2 say @entity15 was expert at sneaking past ‘ sleeping dogs ’ and disabling alarm systems			1
‘ when all alarms were disabled , he would remove entire drawers full of silver items and take them outside to test them with his own silver test kit ; plate silver would be thrown away at the scene and he would leave with only the finest and most expensive items , ’ said sheriff @entity36 said in a statement			1
only the finest : @entity15 would only snatch high - quality silverware , leaving behind lesser silver and cheaper jewellery the robberies began in february 2011 yet despite dozens taking place across the @entity29 from @entity53 to @entity2 , local police seemed unable to connect the dots until a retired @entity26 police detective who had put @entity15 away five times previously , worked it out			1
ex-cop @entity25 first put @entity15 away in 1983 and figured it would n’t be long before he got up to his old tricks			1
he put together a four - man crew of retired police detectives and one retired federal marshal with the sole purpose of tracking @entity15 and putting him behind bars			1
all of the retired detectives came across the silver stealer at least once in their respective professional paths , in @entity26 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
‘ i started googling silver thefts , ’ @entity25 told @entity70			2
‘ and as soon as i saw a pattern , i knew it was @entity15			1
i called the police in @entity23 and told them , ' let me explain how this is all going to go down			0
' ’ during his career , detective @entity25 became something of an expert on @entity15 and nicknames him ‘ the @entity79 ’ or the ‘ @entity80 , ’			1
‘ it 's his addiction , ’ det			0
‘ he does n't do drugs or drink alcohol			0
he needs to prove he 's better than the police			0
’ he explained that robbing silver also had its advantages with many victims not realising they have been robbed until closer to the holidays when it ’s time to take out the good silverware			2
he would usually target expensive homes and look for leads in architecture magazines that showcased the homes of the rich and famous			0
thief to the stars : amongst his 300 burglaries @entity15 stole silver from the homes of @entity11 and @entity12 the retired detective helped several police departments with their enquiries pointing out similarities in the cases such as the same way in which the suspect always cut holes in windows , so he could crawl in			1
then he would snatch high - quality silverware , leaving behind less valuable silver and pieces of jewellery			0
sheriff 's deputies in @entity21 , @entity2 arrested @entity15 on monday and charged him with felony burglary and conspiracy			2
after a short chase , he was cuffed and officers called detective @entity25 to let him know the news			0
‘ they told him , ' @entity122 , there 's someone on the phone			0
' when they told him it was @entity25 , he just buried his head in his knees , ’ detective @entity25 said			0
‘ i know @entity15 , ’ @entity25 said			2
‘ he ca n't help himself			0
in the past i tried helping him get a job			0
the guy is brilliant and could do anything he chose			0
but he chose being a thief			0
’ although @entity15 was arrested in @entity2 , he is expected to be extradited first to @entity23 before authorities in @entity53 and @entity136 press charges .			2
