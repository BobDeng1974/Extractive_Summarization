@entity1 women are officially the most overweight in @entity2			1
a quarter are obese – so fat it threatens their health – according to alarming figures			2
this is a far higher proportion than in the other countries of @entity2			0
obesity levels in the @entity1 are far worse than @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 @entity1 men are doing almost as badly , with more than one in five classed as obese , according to the authoritative figures			1
experts are especially concerned by the young age at which so many women here are developing serious weight problems			0
a disturbing 16 per cent of young women aged 18 to 24 are obese – up to 16 times higher than many other @entity22 countries where the rate is between 1 per cent and 3 per cent			2
young men are doing better , around 6 per cent are obese , but a worrying one third of men aged 45 - 64 are obese in the @entity1			1
the deeply troubling figures are contained in a report from @entity29 , the @entity30 ’s statistics agency , which compares obesity levels in 19 countries from 2008/2009			1
only the @entity33 and @entity34 , which are not included in the league table , have higher obesity rates in the developed world			2
the latest table shows that only the former @entity40 states of @entity41 and @entity42 – where one in five women is obese – approach the @entity1 ’s unenviable league - topping figure of 23.9 per cent			1
women in @entity48 are catching up fast with rates of 22 per cent			0
fifteen per cent of women in @entity9 are obese , while they are slimmer still in @entity11 ( 12.7 per cent ) and @entity10 ( 9.3 per cent )			1
the report says it is ‘ particularly significant ’ that a third of men in the @entity1 are obese between the ages of 45 and 64			1
overall , 22 per cent of @entity1 men are obese – and twice as many are overweight , say experts			1
@entity56 , director of policy and public affairs at the @entity59 , said the @entity1 led the field in obesity – but in almost all developed countries two - thirds of adults are overweight or obese			1
‘ levels of fatness are increasing all the time , ’ he said			2
‘ they go from overweight to obesity and affect more than 60 per cent of adults in most countries			2
‘ the recession is likely to make things worse , as people find they can not afford the expense of buying healthier foods and fill up on fatty and sugary junk foods			2
’ the @entity77 estimates that obesity causes at least 30,000 deaths a year in the @entity1 , through conditions such as cancer , heart disease , strokes and diabetes			1
it is shown to shorten lifespan , with individuals carrying 4st extra in weight at risk of losing three years in life expectancy			0
@entity92 measurement is used to calculate whether an individual is a healthy weight or not			0
this is calculated by dividing weight ( in kilos ) by the square of his or her height ( in metres )			0
under 18.5 is underweight , 18.5 - 25 is a healthy weight , 25 - 29.5 is overweight , 30 - 35 is obese and over 35 is very obese			0
it means , for instance , a 5ft 6in woman weighing 14st would have a @entity105 of 30 and would be seen as obese			0
a 6ft man weighing 16st also has a @entity105 of 30			0
the formula has been criticised because it may penalise those who have a lot of muscle , said mr @entity56 , but he added : ‘ everyone knows when it ’s fat			0
’ the report follows estimates made earlier this year in @entity116 medical journal which found that if current trends continue , the size of the obese population in the @entity1 will increase by 11million over the next two decades – up from 15million at present			1
by 2030 the problem will trigger a startling number of illnesses			0
there will be almost half a million more cases of heart disease and there will be around 700,000 extra cases of diabetes , with 130,000 more developing cancer as a consequence of their weight			0
experts blame abundant energy - dense food , too little exercise and lack of will by policymakers to curb over-consumption			0
the @entity29 report links obesity with levels of education , saying that the better educated tend to be slimmer			1
percentage of population classed as clinically obese : figures were not available for @entity148 , @entity34 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 experts have been calling for ‘ fat ’ taxes on unhealthy food and a ban on advertisements aimed at children			1
@entity160 , of the @entity162 campaign group , said education was key to fighting obesity			0
‘ until the @entity1 puts domestic science properly back into the school curriculum , many women will continue to rely on cheap , ready meals and fast , processed foods for their families and themselves , ’ he added .			2

obesity levels far worse than @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11
more than one in five @entity1 men classed as obese
