during that march , energy bills were burned , fireworks were shot at @entity154 and there were 15 arrests , following scuffles with police			1

today , it seemed the group were hoping for a similar result			2

only thing that gets through are @entity235 and ambulances			0
' fireworks and smoke were seen rising out of @entity65 as the protest got underway last night the group - which uses the @entity15 masks as its trademark - said it fights against mass surveillance , austerity and infringement of human rights the protest was held on the night of @entity182 's @entity15 , and many of the marchers wore the white masks of the man who plotted to blow up parliament in 1605 protesters chanted anti-establishment slogans as they milled around , while others climbed on to the base of @entity151 let off fireworks the group also warned it would have ' bigger banners , louder voices , more people and a louder system '			1

protesters waved banners and placards during the march the protesters came up with a number of creative ways to express their messages of discontent the group said in its manifesto that it fights again mass surveillance , austerity and infringement of human rights anti-capitalist protesters held up signs saying ' expect @entity316 ' ' we are @entity198 ' and ' we are everyone ' rather than communicate directly with local authorities , @entity198 sent a message to the government the protesters made their way through central @entity5 , going to @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 and it added that they have imposed @entity324 of the @entity325 across @entity326 between 5pm today and 2am tomorrow , which provides powers to remove masks when police fear a crime will be committed			1
@entity331 said : ' @entity332 deals with around 4,500 protests and events every year			0
these can range from a single protester to hundreds of thousands of people walking through the capital 's streets			2
' officers work with organisers to ensure that people are able to carry out their right to peaceful protest whilst ensuring @entity345 can go about their daily business			2
' last year ’s @entity5 march saw more than 2,500 protesters take to the streets , in a rally which saw fireworks thrown at @entity154 and a total of 15 arrests			2
rather than communicate directly with local authorities , @entity198 sent a message to the government , and to global world leaders : ' to oppressive governments , we say this : we do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame			1
however , you will not prevail against the angry masses of the body politic			0
