in return for the secret payments , the eavesdropping agency was expected to ‘ pull its weight ’ , according to documents leaked last night by the fugitive whistleblower @entity4			1
one document states that weaker regulation for @entity11 spies than @entity9 agents is one of the intelligence services ’ ‘ selling points ’ for the @entity9			0
the leaked papers will raise more questions for the spy agency and ministers who oversee it , over the extent to which the @entity9 makes demands of @entity11 in its intelligence - gathering activities			2
in a document from 2010 , @entity12 said the @entity40 had ‘ raised a number of issues with regards to meeting [ its ] minimum expectations ’ , and @entity12 ‘ remains short of the full @entity40 ask ’			1
a cache leaked to @entity42 reveals the @entity11 ’s biggest fear is that ‘ @entity9 perceptions of the … partnership diminish , leading to loss of access , and / or reduction in investment … to the @entity11 ’			2
the information is the latest to be leaked by mr @entity4 , a former @entity40 contractor who was charged with espionage in the @entity9			1
he left @entity56 ’s @entity55 yesterday where he has been since late june after exposing @entity57 – a @entity9 intelligence project to snoop on @entity60 accounts , emails and phone calls			0
claim : the @entity9 government gave @entity11 's spying centre at @entity12 ( pictured ) £ 100million over three years and apparently expected to influence its work , it was alleged @entity12 was criticised after he claimed @entity11 spies used the @entity57 system to bypass @entity11 laws			1
last week @entity71 ’s spy watchdog called for an investigation into the laws on intelligence eavesdropping , saying they may not be fit for purpose			0
the latest documents reveal the @entity40 gave @entity12 £ 22.9million in 2009 , £ 39.9million in 2010 , and another £ 34.7m in 2011 - 12			1
the 2010 payment included £ 4million to support @entity12 ’s work for @entity80 forces in @entity81 , and £ 17.2million to fund the agency ’s mastering the internet project , which gathers and stores vast amounts of ‘ raw ’ information ready for analysis			2
fugitive former @entity9 spy @entity4 was granted refugee status in @entity6 yesterday amid @entity90 concerns he is now in the embrace of @entity56 ’s secret services			1
the 30 - year - old intelligence leaker was accompanied by his @entity11 handler @entity94 as he left @entity56 ’s @entity55 in a taxi			0
miss @entity94 , an ex-lover of @entity97 boss @entity96 , has been at mr @entity4 ’s side in the airport ’s transit area for almost six weeks			0
the granting of refugee status pending his application for temporary political asylum is certain to spark fury in @entity106 which had urged president @entity107 to deport him to the @entity9 to face espionage charges			0
also funded by the @entity40 was redevelopment of @entity12 ’s sister site in @entity111 , @entity112 , to the tune of £ 15.5million			1
the site intercepts transatlantic cables that carry internet traffic			0
in return , the documents suggest @entity12 has to take the @entity9 view into account when deciding what to prioritise			1
the money has been an important source of income for the @entity11 agency as it has been forced to cut costs and has shed more than 300 of its 6,000 staff			0
documents seen by the newspaper show @entity12 is heavily investing in harvesting personal information from mobile phones and apps , and wants to be able to ‘ exploit any phone , anywhere , anytime ’			2
but some @entity12 staff expressed concern about ‘ the morality and ethics of their operational work , particularly given the level of deception involved ’			2
a @entity11 @entity144 paper setting out @entity12 ’s view after the 2010 strategic defence and security review says : ‘ our key partnership is with the @entity9 … @entity12 must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight			1
’ a @entity152 spokesman said : ‘ in a 60 - year alliance it is entirely unsurprising that there are joint projects … but the benefits flow in both directions			0
