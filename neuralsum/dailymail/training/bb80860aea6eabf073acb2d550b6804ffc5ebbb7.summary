@entity10 is aimed at @entity161 teams within companies , or by recruiters

employees are given a score based on time at the firm , for example

if the employee follows a new company on @entity35 , or connects with a recruiter on @entity36 their score increases
the @entity161 team or recruiters are then alerted to this change in behaviour
