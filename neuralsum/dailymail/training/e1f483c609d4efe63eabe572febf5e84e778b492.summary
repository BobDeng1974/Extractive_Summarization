by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 03:15 est , 2 january 2013 a couple who created their own children ’s programmes because they were so appalled by ‘ nonsense ’ such as the @entity6 have become an internet hit			1
@entity8 , 44 , and @entity9 , 35 , were regularly having to switch off the television because they believed the shows on offer were ‘ numbing ’ their two young children ’s brains			1
the married couple believed popular programmes such as @entity19 were just ‘ virtual e-numbers ’ that made children hyperactive – so they decided to make their own			1
the stories are designed for pre-school children and can be downloaded via the internet			1
the 15 - minute episodes can be viewed only once they are started by parents , meaning that children can not just sit watching programme after programme as they could with television			2
mr @entity8 and miss @entity9 believe this gets youngsters to interact with their parents and discuss the show			1
the couple are now receiving more than 500,000 monthly hits worldwide on the animated tales , with interest particularly keen in the @entity63 , and experts reckon the venture could now become a multi-million - pound business with the right investment			1
rubbish : shows like the @entity6 are ' virtual e-numbers ' according to the parents and offer nothing good for @entity73 's children mr @entity8 , a freelance media lecturer who lives in @entity74 with his wife and their two children @entity27 , eight , and @entity28 , five , said : ‘ we ’re delighted with the success we have had			1
that was never the aim , so it has been a terrific bonus			0
we were just fed up with all the unnecessary nonsense children ’s heads are filled with			0
we wanted to make something we felt happy about our son and daughter sitting down to watch			0
‘ when we were young , there would be a short spell after school when you could watch children ’s tv			0
now there are entire channels dedicated to it			0
‘ the massive problem with tv for pre-schoolers in the @entity73 is that you are either sending them to la - la land with the @entity6 , or making them hyper watching programmes like the @entity19			1
‘ tv effectively becomes virtual e-numbers for children with nothing remotely stimulating for them			1
’ concerns : @entity27 and @entity28 watch the box and they themselves contribute to the show created by their mum and dad happier : more than 500,000 people have watched their animations in a venture that could make them huge sums in the future housewife miss @entity9 added : ‘ @entity31 is n’t filling children ’s heads with rubbish but it still captures the imagination enough for them to be entertained			1
‘ it harks back to old - school , traditional values in terms of children ’s tv , fulfilling genuine educational material			2
at least that ’s what we ’ve aimed for			0
’ the creative couple were inspired to make the films when @entity27 was four and began asking questions about @entity139			2
they looked for programmes to help explain but found nothing suitable			2
instead they designed @entity144 , a 70 - minute animated film about the friends discovering the true meaning of @entity139			0
it proved so popular with their children and friends ’ children that they decided to continue			0
pair : @entity27 and @entity28 say they love the @entity31 characters and learn a lot more from them mr @entity8 produces and writes each episode , @entity27 performs the voice of @entity31 and miss @entity9 performs the voice of @entity32			1
family friend @entity160 draws the animations , which have been expanded to a whole series of stories			0
last month , mr @entity8 and miss @entity9 launched their own online channel , allowing anyone with a @entity167 or a smart tv to stream their programmes via the internet , like @entity171			1
the programmes can currently be downloaded for free but the couple also sell dvds via their website , www.jackandholly.com			2
they set up the enterprise on a ‘ shoestring budget ’ and currently operate on a not - for - profit basis , donating their small profits to children ’s hospices across the @entity73			0
but business development experts have told them their creation has the potential to make them millionaires			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ with the right investment we certainly believe the business could potentially be worth more than £ 500,000 within just a year or so			2
from there who knows ? we ’ve been told the sky ’s the limit			0
‘ the response has been so terrific – it shows parents are looking for quality programming for their children			2
and at least we finally have something for our two to watch			0

@entity24 and @entity9 created **cartoon** ' @entity31 '
the educational **cartoon** has became a *surprise* internet hit
their films have had 500,000 hits a month online from across the world
parents said programmes like @entity19 are ' virtual e-numbers '
