new research suggests people at high risk of developing diabetes may be able to escape the condition by cutting the time they spending sitting down by 90 minutes every day			1
consequently , official advice recommending 150 minutes of physical activity each week should be amended to encourage people to be less sedentary all the time , say studies from @entity22			1
they found important risk factors for type 2 diabetes , such as blood glucose and cholesterol levels , improved far more in people told to sit less , compared with those doing required amounts of exercise			1
research leader @entity32 said : ‘ these studies provide preliminary evidence that sedentary behaviour may be a more effective way to target the prevention of type 2 diabetes , rather than just solely focusing on physical activity			1
‘ moreover , sedentary time occupies large portions of the day , unlike moderate to vigorous physical activity			2
’ type 2 diabetes mostly affects middle - aged people and occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar , leading to high levels which can damage body organs and years of ill - health			1
it is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese , leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet			0
patients from two studies on activity levels and diabetes were investigated by a team from the @entity59 at @entity22			2
the patients , who were at high risk of developing diabetes , ranged in age from early 30s to late 60s			0
the team examined the extent to which sedentary time , breaks in sedentary time , vigorous exercise and total physical activity were linked with cardiometabolic risk factors in a population with known risk factors for type 2 diabetes			1
these include blood sugar and cholesterol levels			0
those who spent longer sitting down had risk factors that were ' detrimentally ' linked to diabetes they found those who spent longer periods of time sitting had risk factors that were ‘ detrimentally ’ linked to diabetes whatever their age			2
sedentary time had stronger links with negative scores than improvements brought about by vigorous exercise , says a report in @entity89 ( the journal of the @entity91 )			0
mr @entity32 said the research suggested that cutting sitting time by 90 minutes a day would significantly help people at risk			1
‘ along with messages related to accumulating at least 150 min per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity , which form the cornerstone of diabetes prevention programmes , such interventions may be more effective still if individuals are further encouraged to simply sit less and move more , regardless of the intensity level , ’ he added			2
there is growing evidence which suggests too much sitting - as opposed to insufficient activity - may be a new risk factor for premature death and illness			0
the study comes after @entity111 research showing office workers who sit for more than four hours a day are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease			0
it found those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes			0
dr @entity120 , @entity121 at @entity122 , said : ‘ this study adds to the extensive evidence that spending a lot of time sitting or lying down is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and that being more physically active can help to reduce this risk			1
‘ the suggestion that time spent sitting or lying down may be a more important indicator of poor health than a lack of moderate or vigorous exercise is interesting			0
however , this is not yet confirmed and must be proven with further research			0
‘ what is clear is that anyone who spends a lot of time sitting or lying down could benefit from spending more time being physically active , regardless of the type of activity involved			2
‘ finding activities that you enjoy and can incorporate into your daily life , such as walking , gardening , diy or housework , is the best way to achieve this			0

cutting the time people spend sitting down by 90 minutes a day could reduce type 2 diabetes risk
scientists in @entity22 suggest physical activity advice should be amended as a consequence
