by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:25 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 17:29 est , 9 march 2012 however long it lasts , labour is a gruelling affair			2
so spare a thought for @entity5 , who endured an astonishing 75 days of it			1
and as if that was n't challenging enough , the 31 - year - old was forced to lie upside down for the entire time			1
mrs @entity5 was pregnant with triplets when she went into labour at 21 weeks			1
her first baby was born prematurely and , tragically , was too weak to survive			0
delight : @entity5 with one of her surviving babies after she was able to hold off giving birth for 75 days sleeping easy : @entity17 rests unaware of her dramatic birth the other two were in danger of suffering the same fate – until doctors stepped in to try to delay their delivery			1
they gave mrs @entity5 medication to stop her contractions and got her to lie on a bed tilted at a 30 degree angle , with her feet pointing upwards , to reduce the risk of contractions starting again			1
the umbilical cord was tied and put back inside her uterus			1
she remained in the upside down position 24 hours a day for two and a half months			2
after 75 days – and what is believed to be the longest labour ever recorded – mrs @entity5 gave birth to a healthy girl , @entity17 , and boy , @entity39 , at a neo-natal clinic in the @entity42 town of @entity43			1
yesterday she said she had not been put off by the prospect of lying in such an awkward position for months			2
' i was relieved that there was a chance to keep the pregnancy and to give the babies a chance to be born successfully , ' she added			0
' i am feeling so elated that words ca n't describe it			0
they are such good babies , they are really calm and sometimes they even have the gentlest little smile			0
' i 've been told the labour was a world record			0
i am amazed by what happened but all i want to do is express my gratitude to the staff of this hospital for their wisdom and helpfulness			0
i would never have been able to get through this without them			0
' at 32 weeks into the pregnancy , the doctors decided to deliver @entity17 and @entity39 ( pictured ) by @entity68 on february 15			2
each weighed just under 4lb professor @entity70 , head of the @entity43 obstetrics and neo-natal clinic , explained that mrs @entity5 's labour is considered to have begun when the first baby was born because that was when ' the birth had started '			1
he said mrs @entity5 was kept at the 30 degree angle to ' take pressure off her body '			1
dr @entity70 led the team that saved @entity17 and @entity39 her contractions were suppressed by the drug @entity82 throughout most of the 75 days to prevent her giving birth to the babies too early			2
one of the biggest dangers was mrs @entity5 picking up an infection which could have killed her or the babies			1
' it would be fair to say that this situation , throughout the 75 days , was like trying to not jog a live bomb , ' professor @entity89 said			0
' this [ labour ] started with the premature birth of mrs @entity5 's first triplet , who had no chance of survival , and ended with the birth of third triplet			1
the whole process was very risky			0
' mrs @entity5 was not allowed to move from the bed until the birth , and was fed and bathed while tilted in the same position			1
she added : ' i had to be very disciplined as i was not allowed to move out of the bed for the whole 75 days			0
this was very uncomfortable , but the staff kept me going			0
' we had to arrange for everything to be done at the bed , and i mean everything – i could n't even visit the toilet			0
' at 32 weeks into the pregnancy , the doctors decided to deliver @entity17 and @entity39 by @entity68 on february 15			2
each weighed just under 4lb			0
after leaving her hospital bed , mrs @entity5 had trouble with her balance , but now visits and holds her two babies every day			1
they remain in incubators but are expected to leave hospital soon			0
in december , @entity122 , 29 , from @entity123 , spent ten weeks in a hospital bed tilted at 45 degrees to prevent her suffering a third miscarriage .			2

@entity5 lost one of her triplets at just 22 weeks
drugs eased contractions , umbilical cord tied and put back in the uterus
had to lie almost upside down for more than 10 weeks
