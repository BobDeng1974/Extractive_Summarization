extraordinary new drugs have cleared tumours that have spread throughout lung cancer patients ’ whole bodies , scientists say			1
some are even talking of the new immunotherapy drugs effectively curing patients of the disease , which has a grim survival record			2
after lung cancer has spread to other organs – and by the time it ’s spotted , it usually has – most patients die within months			1
dr @entity15 : the doctor saw one man in his 40s who had lung cancer which had spread to his liver , brain , bones and adrenal glands - but the disease disappeared of all cancers it is by far the biggest killer in @entity28 , claiming 35,000 lives a year , more than bowel and breast cancer combined			1
but now scientists are reporting incredible success treating advanced lung cancer with drugs such as nivolumab			1
next week ‘ stellar ’ trial results for the antibody drug will be presented at the world ’s biggest cancer conference , for the @entity41 , in @entity42			2
doctors will reveal that a quarter of 129 @entity46 patients with advanced lung cancer have survived at least two years after starting nivolumab			1
dr @entity15 of @entity48 in @entity49 said : ‘ you would expect patients in that group to survive a few months , if you ’re lucky			2
so to get 24 per cent living two years is extraordinary			2
’ he saw one man in his 40s had lung cancer which had spread to his liver , brain , bones and adrenal glands , he said			1
‘ by the time it ’s spread that far , you do n’t expect patients to last more than a couple of months			2
but in a recent scan , his doctor could not find any evidence of residual disease			0
’ dr @entity15 said it was also remarkable that so many were responding to this treatment			0
of those treated with the optimum dose , 45 per cent were alive after two years			0
he said : ‘ in any trial you get the odd patient who does very well , but this is an order of magnitude above that			0
’ @entity48 : dr @entity15 of @entity48 in @entity49 said in any trial you get the odd patient who does very well , but this is an order of magnitude above that last september , @entity79 revealed these drugs were being used to treat skin cancer with great success			1
now they are having a similar effect on lung cancer , which is 15 times more deadly			1
@entity86 is one of a new class of drug , called anti-pd1s and @entity91 , which help the immune system ‘ see ’ that tumours are deadly foes			1
explaining how the drugs work dr @entity15 said : ‘ tumours develop a ‘ cloak ’ , like a @entity101 force field , around themselves			0
this stops the immune system attacking them			0
‘ these drugs take that force field away and allow the body ’s immune response to fight the tumour			0
the beauty is we do not have the adverse side effects of conventional treatment			0
’ professor @entity111 , who has been treating @entity28 patients with a similar drug , @entity114 , said : ‘ this is an enormous deal			1
there are patients on treatment who ’ve been going an incredibly long time			0
’ he added it was ‘ not inconceivable ’ that they could be an ‘ effective cure ’ for some – allowing patients to live virtually disease - free for years			2
of @entity125 @entity124 in @entity126 , who has helped spearhead @entity46 nivolumab trials , said it was ‘ a little early ’ to call it a cure			1
but she added : ‘ that ’s what our hope is			0
’ she has also witnessed patients whose tumours have shrunk to almost nothing , with some people still well three years after treatment began			2
one is still well a year after treatment stopped – suggesting the immune system ‘ learns ’ from the intravenous therapy			0
however , dr @entity123 , a supporter of @entity46 charity @entity145 , warned these new drugs were no ‘ magic bullet ’ for lung cancer			1
‘ the next step is to make the drugs even better – combining them with standard treatments , other antibodies , and by priming the tumours			0
we have to figure out how to make them work for everyone			0
