by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the @entity3 circus has parked up at the home of the @entity6 winners for round 10 of the championship , and you can follow all the action from today 's qualifying session at @entity12			1
host commentator that 's four poles in five grands prix for @entity17			1
he waves to the crowd on his way back to the pits			0
@entity22 will start 15th for tomorrow 's race with @entity24 serving a penalty for crashing into @entity26 at the @entity28 @entity27			1
@entity30 @entity29 ; 2 @entity31 ; 3 @entity32 ; 4 @entity33 ; 5 @entity34 ; 6 @entity35 ; 7 @entity36 ; 8 @entity37 ; 9 @entity38 ; 10 @entity39 the @entity30 did n't improve on his time , but it does n't matter as @entity31 only gets to within two tenths			1
@entity42 , an impressive run from the @entity45 driver			0
@entity32 starts his final run , and he sets a pb in the opening sector , but is still a tenth down on @entity17			1
his second sector is strong , too , but the @entity51 is now a couple of tenths slower than the @entity30			2
he completes his lap with a 1:17.0 , and improves on his time but is only third			0
@entity35 goes 4th fastest , but he is one second slower than @entity17			2
@entity33 is up next followed by @entity34 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
@entity17 lights up the timesheets with a 1:16.540			2
that 's a very strong time from the @entity30			1
how will the @entity45 drivers respond ? @entity31 is through first and he is a mighty seven tenths slower than @entity17 , and what of @entity32 ? he is third , seven tenths off the pace , too			1
@entity39 is fighting to keep his @entity63 in a straight line , and he posts a rather disappointing 1:19.3			0
indeed that is his worst of the entire session so far			0
and it is the @entity63 of @entity39 who is the first driver to take to the track			0
a dejected @entity70 on traffic in qualifying : ' it does n't matter			0
we did not get through and that is the main thing			0
i had a different balance on the last run , so not great			0
i have struggled all weekend			0
it has not been a easy weekend , but hey			0
' a disappointing day for the @entity80 then with @entity70 ko 'd from @entity82			2
he complained about traffic through @entity85 , but it does n't look as though the @entity87 man was really held up			0
but he does n't do it on that run , and it looks as though he will start only 11th for tomorrow 's grand prix			1
how disappointing for the @entity92			0
@entity93 takes to the track bidding to get into the top - 10 shootout , but he needs to find three tenths in the final sector to do it ... @entity17 heads the field from @entity31 , @entity35 , @entity33 , @entity32 , @entity36 , @entity34 , @entity37 , @entity70 and @entity38			1
@entity93 heading out here unless he can improve on his time ; he 's four tenths slower than @entity104 team - mate @entity36			1
but what a time that is from @entity31			0
he goes almost one second quicker than @entity38 , but here comes @entity17 and he is some two tenths faster than the @entity45 man			2
seven times posted so far with eight minutes remaining of the session			0
and home favourite @entity38 in his @entity63 is the first driver to take to the circuit			0
mercedes have confirmed that @entity22 suffered a right - front brake disc failure			1
replays of that @entity117 accident showed him immediately taking his hands off the steering wheel			0
his inside front locked up , @entity113 rotated and smashed into the tyre barrier at around 160mph			0
it certainly looked like a brake failure on his @entity113			1
@entity123 is the big - name casualty in that first session			2
@entity22 's time was good enough for 12th , but he will start 16th in tomorrow 's race			1
not what he needed after a hat - trick of disappointing qualifying sessions			0
@entity26 , @entity123 , @entity24 , @entity131 and @entity132 occupy the bottom six places with three minutes left			0
and on the supersoft tyres , @entity17 heads to the top of the timesheets after his two earlier errors			2
the @entity30 is over half - a - second quicker than @entity31			1
the session is back underway and @entity17 is the first to take to the circuit			1
we 've got a little over six minutes left			0
this is the first time @entity22 has n't made @entity142 since the @entity143			2
@entity22 locked his front brakes , but it looked as though something broke on his @entity113			2
he certainly seemed a little bit shaken			0
@entity17 meanwhile , has work to do when the session re-starts			1
he loses the rear end of his mercedes under braking and crashes into the tyre barrier			0
the @entity80 reports he is ok over the team radio , but he heads off in the medical car rubbing his knees			1
and @entity17 makes another mistake down at @entity160			2
the @entity162 leader is struggling here			0
meanwhile , it is confirmed that @entity164 wo n't be leaving the garage ; a torrid weekend for @entity166			0
that 's a strong lap from the ever - impressive @entity31 who goes almost half a second faster than @entity22			1
@entity17 yet to post a competitive time			2
normal order is restored as @entity22 goes over six tenths quicker than @entity33			2
a big lock up for @entity17 , he runs wide , and he is forced to abort his lap. but @entity175 @entity27 pole - sitter @entity32 heads to the top of the lap charts before he is usurped by @entity33			1
the @entity178 posts a time of 1:19.379 ; only seven lap times posted so far			0
we have got 12 minutes left			0
four minutes of the 18 - minute opening session gone , and it is @entity70 in his @entity87 who tops the timesheets at the present time			1
a quiet start to today 's qualifying session so far			1
and the @entity189 of @entity190 is the first driver out on track			0
hydraulic failure on @entity196 's @entity195 meanwhile , means it is unlikely he will make it out of the garage			2
qualifying has been @entity22 's achilles heel in recent times			1
he locked up on his final run in @entity205 , spun in @entity175 , and aborted his last lap at @entity207			0
how will the @entity80 respond today ? * @entity22 's win in the @entity28 @entity27 was the 27th of his @entity3 career , equalling the feat of sir @entity212			1
@entity213 is the most successful @entity80 with 31 victories			2
* @entity117 now has 61 podiums to his name ( 1st : 27 ; 2nd : 18 ; 3rd : 16 )			0
one more will equal @entity218 's @entity28 record of 62			1
* @entity17 's run of 17 consecutive results in the points ended at @entity207 , with the @entity30 retiring for the first time since the @entity223 in april 2013			1
* @entity113 have won eight of the nine races this season			0
only five teams have scored more in a single campaign - @entity104 , @entity87 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity45			0
* @entity31 is the first @entity45 driver in nine years to score back - to - back podiums , with @entity232 the last to achieve the feat in may 2005			2
you have to go back to 2003 , and @entity235 , for three or more in a row			0
* @entity104 and @entity87 have now gone 23 and 28 races without a win respectively			0
* up until last year @entity239 had been the only @entity30 name to have won the @entity30 @entity27 , with @entity241 a four - time winner in 1995 , 2002 , 2004 and 2006 , and brother @entity243 a victor in 2001			1
@entity35 added his name to the @entity30 roll of honour last year			2
* only three circuits have hosted the @entity30 @entity27 : @entity12 ( 33 ) , the @entity249 ( 27 , including races at the nordschleife and current gp circuit ) and a sole event at @entity256 's @entity255 circuit in 1959			1
* @entity257 , a one - time assistant timekeeper , is credited with the idea of building a circuit in his home town , @entity12			1
with support from the mayor and the local council , the first motorbike race was held at the circuit , then known as the @entity266 , on may 25 , 1932			0
* a major layout revision in 1938 created the fast @entity12 loop that would remain fundamentally unchanged until the end of 2001			2
a 62million euro ( Â£ 52million ) rebuild in time for the 2002 race gave the circuit its current form and increased spectator capacity from 83,000 to 120,000			0
* @entity104 have an impressive @entity30 @entity27 record with a mighty 21 victories , well ahead of nine wins for @entity45 and eight for @entity87 @entity30 can boast the reigning @entity162 in @entity35 and in @entity17 the man whom leads the drivers ' standings , but the turnout for this weekend 's race has been poor			1
@entity283 contrast to @entity207 where stands were packed for all three days ... the air temperature is 32 degrees , and track temperature is over 50 degrees for today 's qualifying session ... the hottest of the year so far			2
not since the @entity289 banned @entity28 cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan , have sporting officials been such party - poopers			1
i got married to my beautiful girlfriend @entity296 in @entity297 last week and it was a wonderful experience			0
i was n't sure if i would feel anxious about the occasion , but it was such a pleasure			0
@entity239 's wife @entity301 has written a personal note thanking @entity3 fans for their support following the seven - time world champion 's skiing accident			2
@entity307 : the two protagonists for the world championship , @entity22 and @entity17 , were more keen to play on their friendship than play up their animosity			1
but it is @entity17 who holds the psychological edge heading into qualifying after topping the timesheets in this morning 's final practice session ... and by some margin , too			1
the @entity30 was over six tenths quicker than @entity22 with @entity36 the best of the rest in his @entity104			1
good afternoon , petrol heads and welcome to our live coverage of qualifying for the @entity30 @entity27			1
@entity17 arrives at his home race four points ahead of team - mate @entity22 after suffering his first dnf of the season at @entity207			1
but his track record in @entity30 is n't good ; he 's never finished on the podium here - his best result was 4th back in 2009			1
@entity22 in contrast , has been victorious on two occasions , in 2008 and 2011			1
and he starts this weekend as the bookmakers ' favourite to complete a hat - trick of wins in @entity30 tomorrow .			1

@entity22 suffered brake failure in opening session and crashed at *165mph*
he headed to medical centre but was released and is back in the *paddock*
@entity80 will start only 16th for tomorrow 's grand prix at @entity12
@entity22 is four points *adrift* of team - mate @entity17 in drivers ' championship
he is bidding to win his second straight race after @entity28 @entity27 triumph
@entity22 has won in @entity30 on two previous occasions in 2008 and 2011
