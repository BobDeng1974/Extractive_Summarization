by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 10:47 est , 12 november 2013 fashion photographer @entity1 believes red - headed males have been bullied and stigmatised for their locks for too long			1
now he 's seeking to show that having ginger hair does n't make you less sexy with a new exhibition called @entity9			1
the photo display features attractive and muscular ginger - haired men with their tops off in an attempt to 're - brand ' them as alpha males and redefine stereotypes			0
smouldering : photographer @entity17 wants to show redheads can be sexy with his exhibition positive image : @entity21 wants to give redheads more heroic role models one of his flame haired models is an @entity26 hero - gold medal winning longer jumper @entity27			1
naturally red - haired himself , @entity21 , from @entity29 , said he was bullied growing up as a result of his locks and said it 's wrong it has become an ' acceptable form of racism '			1
now he wants to change the way society views redheads			0
he said : ' the aim of the exhibition is to create the image of a positive role model for ginger men because there 's a serious lack of them in the @entity47			2
in film and tv they 're portrayed as weak characters			0
' it 's just like any other form of prejudice - being anti-ginger is like one of the last acceptable forms of racism left in our society			0
@entity26 champion : long jumper @entity27 posed for the exhibition lack of demand : most of the models were found through street casting as modelling agencies did n't have many ginger men on their books @entity21 said : ' there is an institutionalised stigma prevalent in the @entity47 especially ' against those with ginger hair 50 shades of red : that 's the number of models @entity21 is aiming to have in his exhibition ' red haired men are never heroes or the leading man , never the alpha male , or portrayed as sexual			1
they seem to emasculate and desexualise guys with ginger hair			0
there is an institutionalised stigma prevalent in the @entity47 especially			0
' a recent study by ancestry company @entity47 's @entity88 found that 20 million people in the @entity47 population carry the ginger gene			0
' children pick up on what 's different and it 's been allowed to develop in our country , then as adults we 're are derogatory to people with red hair without realising ' but with no red - haired male role models to look up to , @entity17 grew up hating his hair			1
the fashion photographer , who has worked for @entity104 and @entity105 , discovered he was n't alone in feeling inadequate because of his hair colour as he spent a year seeking men to feature in his exhibition			2
he found men in the @entity110 are often teased for their red - hair too but that it 's far worse in the @entity47 , where people can be instinctively and unashamedly ' derogatory ' to redheads			1
he said : ' during the course of putting this show together , i 've had some very positive feedback from mums and dads and spouses from around the world showing real gratitude because there 's stigma in the @entity110 too			0
breaking stereotypes : @entity21 hopes his show will help people see redheads in a new light proud : the flame haired men were happy to show off their bodies for the photo shoot role models : the exhibition aims to show redheads can be heroic and strong time for change : knights said he discovered some ' real horror stories ' of men bullied for the colour of their locks rarely seen on the catwalk : it 's currently quirky or exotic to have a ginger model in a show ' they 've got some real horror stories about the red haired men in their family being bullied			1
' but it 's far worse in the @entity47 - it 's a hangover from the war with the @entity156 about 500 years ago where negative attention was turned to their red hair and now it 's stuck			2
' the agencies were shocked realising none of their models had red hair and nobody had ever wanted them before ' ' children pick up on what 's different and it 's been allowed to develop in our country , then as adults we 're are derogatory to people with red hair without realising			1
it 's taboo or quirky or exotic to have a ginger model in a show			0
' his casting for his exhibition highlighted how few red - headed models there are			2
he had to do street casting because few modelling agencies had ginger men on their books			1
he explained : ' when looking for models , i called all the agencies and none of them had any			0
one agency said they 'd send me a package of their red - headed boys , but ten minutes later called back realising they did n't have any			0
pin ups : the exhibition @entity9 will be on display in @entity29 , from 16 december ' the agencies were shocked realising none of their models had red hair and nobody had ever wanted them before - i found most of my models street casting			1
' he has pictured gathered 36 redheads so far and hopes to reach 50 by the time the exhibition opens in mid december			0
