abuse epidemic : in the last six weeks , there have been an unprecedented number of reports of the illegal images appearing on pages as mundane as furniture websites , says an internet watchdog the @entity4 said it was a new phenomenon that it was unable to explain as most of the people who are taken to view these images do not want to see them			1
the figures , given to @entity29 5 live breakfast with @entity31 by the @entity4 , demonstrate the difficulty of the battle to remove child abuse images from websites			1
folders containing the images are uploaded on to an ordinary website but can only be accessed by other - usually pornographic websites - the charity said			0
it is only by clicking on the link which takes you through to the relevant part of the ordinary website that the images can be viewed			0
the chances of an everyday internet user stumbling upon the images are slim , it adds			0
in one example , a furniture website was hacked and a folder containing hundreds of child sex abuse images was uploaded , it said			1
the @entity4 said that the illegal images are often coupled with malware and viruses which may be a reason why hackers post them on other websites			1
it is unlikely that those who host the original adult site containing the link would have any idea that a third party had set up the diversion to the ordinary website and uploaded the images			0
@entity4 technical researcher @entity69 said : ‘ we had n’t seen significant numbers of hacked websites for around two years , and then suddenly in june we started seeing this happening more and more			2
‘ it shows how someone , not looking for child sexual abuse images , can stumble across it			2
the original adult content the internet user is viewing is far removed from anything related to young people or children			0
‘ we ’ve received reports from people distressed about what they ’ve seen			0
our reporters have been extremely diligent in explaining exactly what happened , enabling our analysts to re-trace their steps and take action against the child sexual abuse images			2
‘ since identifying this trend we ’ve been tracking it and feeding into police forces and our sister hotlines abroad			0
’ @entity97 , ceo of the @entity4 , said : ‘ hackers are planting folders of criminal content on ordinary business websites			1
‘ we came across a furniture website which was hacked and it had a folder containing hundreds of images of child sexual abuse and these are some of the worst of the worst			2
‘ and that ’s just an example of one of the 227 reports we ’ve received over the last six weeks of these hacked websites			1
’ victims : the @entity4 said that it had seen a 42 per cent increase on last year of reports to its online hotline since the murders of @entity119 , left , and @entity120 , right the @entity4 was set up by the internet industry to report child sex abuse images , which are illegal , to the police and to provide a hotline so members of the public can report the images			1
the @entity4 said that it had seen a 42 per cent increase on last year of reports to its online hotline since the @entity119 and @entity120 cases			2
their attackers @entity120 and @entity134 had both sought child sex abuse images online			2
it receives up to 170 reports a day from people who have spotted something disturbing online			0
@entity140 , a government advisor on child internet safety , said that hackers often attach viruses to images in order to create a new distribution point to send out more images			1
he said : ‘ this reduces the risk that the bad guys will be caught or traced because they have hijacked the machines that other people are using			0
their computer then becomes a distribution points for those images			0
’ the fact the folders of images were hidden on normal websites also meant that paedophiles would know where to find them , he said			0
he added that the recent upsurge in activity suggested that a criminal gang might have newly adopted the approach .			0

@entity4 says it received 227 reports in six weeks of websites being hijacked by hackers posting images of child abuse
