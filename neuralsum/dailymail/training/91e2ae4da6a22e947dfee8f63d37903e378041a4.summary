by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 put the world on course for a new @entity5 yesterday , annexing @entity6 and telling the @entity7 to get out of @entity9 ’s back yard			1
as @entity9 was accused of war crimes after the death of a @entity13 soldier , @entity2 defiantly told a joint session of the @entity9 parliament that he would not accept @entity7 influence ‘ next to our home or on our historic territories ’			1
and in a stark warning that @entity21 risks dismemberment if it seeks to join the @entity23 or @entity24 , he said he would not tolerate @entity7 countries ‘ behaving as the master of the house outside our fence ’			2
’ the speech sent shockwaves through the international community and appeared to have upended two decades of diplomacy since the fall of the @entity52 designed to imbed @entity9 as a member of the international community			1
it came as a @entity13 officer and a member of a local @entity6 self - defence brigade were shot dead when @entity60 militia stormed a military outpost in the @entity6 capital of @entity63			1
adoring public : @entity2 was last night riding the crest of an adulatory wave after righting what many @entity9 see as an historical wrong and reintegrating @entity6 and the @entity69 fleet headquarters of @entity37 @entity71 fervour : dozens of @entity9 flags flutter in the breeze below a typically overcast @entity41 sky @entity13 prime minister @entity76 said the storming of the military facility showed that the dispute ‘ has gone from the political stage to the military by the fault of the @entity9 ’			1
he added : ‘ today , @entity9 soldiers began shooting at @entity13 servicemen and this is a war crime without any statute of limitations			1
’ @entity88 yesterday condemned the decision to annex @entity6 ‘ on the basis of a sham referendum held at the barrel of a @entity9 gun ’			1
on the crest of a wave : @entity9 president @entity31 stands next to @entity6 premier @entity95 as he addresses a rally in @entity97 , @entity41 , celebrating @entity6 's decision to join with @entity9 cult of personality : @entity9 hold flags adorned with @entity2 's face and a slogan reading ' we are together ! ' mr @entity95 , the new @entity6 premier , raises his fist as he shares the stage with speaker of the @entity109 , left , and head of @entity37 administration @entity36 , right he said : ‘ the steps taken by president @entity2 today to attempt to annex @entity6 to @entity9 are in flagrant breach of international law and send a chilling message across the continent of @entity117			1
‘ president @entity2 should be in no doubt that @entity9 will face more serious consequences			2
’ the prime minister will call on fellow @entity23 leaders to bring in a new round of tougher economic sanctions , plus an arms embargo , when they meet at a @entity127 summit tomorrow			0

’ last night , @entity9 politicians and media were telling @entity2 to grab back oil and gas - rich @entity145 and authoritarian @entity148 as well as more slices of a battered @entity21			1
senior politician @entity150 hailed ‘ the great day when the gathering of @entity9 lands began ’			0
@entity153 made a spookily similar speech to @entity2 when he seized the @entity155 , making similar references to common themes the uncompromising autocrat got to his feet and made a bombastic speech as he seized a part of a neighbouring state dominated by his own countrymen			2
it came in the midst of a referendum condemned by other powers as a sham , with voters intimidated by the autocrat ’s looming tanks			0
the move was greeted with delirious pleasure by his own citizens but seen as a portent of international strife by other @entity7 countries			2
the despot in question is not @entity31 but @entity153			0
the occasion was not the annexation of @entity6 but the @entity185 seizure of the @entity155 , the @entity187 - speaking part of @entity188			2
@entity2 , who spoke to the @entity9 parliament yesterday , appears to have stolen many of the themes of his speech from the @entity194 ’s address to the @entity195 as he seized the @entity155 in october 1938			1
@entity2 said @entity6 had always been @entity9 : ‘ in people ’s hearts and minds , @entity6 has always been an integral part of @entity9			1

@entity153 said : ‘ as a @entity210 , i am accustomed to strike back at an attacker			0
’ @entity2 claimed he would not invade other parts of @entity21 if @entity9 was allowed to exercise influence : ‘ do n’t believe those who try to frighten you with @entity9 and who scream that other ( @entity13 ) regions will follow after @entity6			1
we do not want a partition of @entity21			0
’ @entity153 also claimed that his ambitions would stop at the @entity155			0
‘ i have declared that the frontier between @entity222 and @entity187 is a final one			0
