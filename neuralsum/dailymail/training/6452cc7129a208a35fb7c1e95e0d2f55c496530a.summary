by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:02 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 05:30 est , 7 february 2013 @entity2 today piled pressure on disgraced former colleague @entity4 to repay the £ 17,000 payout he received after quitting the @entity6 to fight criminal charges			1
the deputy prime minister said @entity4 had to ' pay amends ' after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice over speeding points a decade ago			1
mr @entity2 will today call the by - election in @entity4 ’s @entity15 seat on february 28 – far earlier than expected – amid @entity17 jitters that it could fall to their coalition partners			1
disgraced : the by - election for one - time energy secretary @entity4 's ( seen leaving his home in @entity24 today ) former @entity15 seat will take place at the end of this month mr @entity2 fired the starting gun on his campaign today with a savage attack on the conservatives over their failure to agree to a mansion tax on expensive homes , while claiming sole credit for cutting the income tax bill for more than 60,000 basic rate taxpayers in @entity15			1
he used the major speech of the by - election contest to accuse the @entity39 of demanding a tax cut for millionaires while he battled to cut tax bills for low and middle earners			2
but during his weekly radio phone - in he was repeatedly challenged over @entity4 's dramatic fall from grace , and the £ 17,000 he received after leaving the @entity6 a year ago when he was charged by police			1
when pressed , mr @entity2 eventually said the public would expect @entity4 to give the money back to the taxpayer			1
' i totally understand why people think that now he has pleaded guilty and when he is sentenced that he should pay amends for what ’s happened , ' he said on @entity54			2
' but at the end of the day @entity4 has got to make that decision i do n’t yet know what sentence the judge is going to hand down to him			1
' rivalry : @entity4 and @entity2 clashed during the 2007 leadership to succeed sir @entity61 in his speech , mr @entity2 revived the prospect of a mansion tax to target wealthy home owners			1
he said his ' preferred option ' was a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £ 2million , applied just to the value over and above £ 2m			0
alternatively he proposed new council tax bands at the ' top end ' levied on properties worth over £ 2million			0
mr @entity2 said : ' both of these options are based on a very simple principle : that we should ask a small number of very wealthy individuals to make a reasonable contribution , in order to provide desperately needed help for millions of ordinary people			0
' nothing could do more to demonstrate a commitment to greater fairness in our tax system			0
it ’s an open secret that our conservative partners do not share our views on this			0
' however , we will continue to make this argument , in this @entity89 and beyond			0
our approach is simple : taxes on mansions ; tax cuts for millions			0
an approach to tax that puts payslips before palaces , if you like			0
' the by - election contest is likely to be one of the most hotly - contested in recent years , with two governing parties going head - to - head			0
both mr @entity2 and @entity103 know that victory for their party would help settle complaints about their leadership , and defeat will raise serious doubts about their hopes at the 2015 general election			0
@entity17 insisted their decision , as the sitting party in the constituency , to opt for a short contest reflected the high state of preparedness of the local party , even though they have yet to choose a candidate			1
' we are going to throw the kitchen sink at it			0
i 'm pretty sure that the @entity126 will as well , ' one source said			0
speculation : it is thought @entity129 may stand for the conservatives in @entity4 's former seat ' it is going to be a tight contest , and generally in tight contests in two - way marginals you get some pretty robust exchanges			1
' however , the @entity126 have indicated that they intend to relentlessly highlight @entity4 's record , who quit the @entity140 on monday after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice after years of denials			2
conservative chairman @entity144 told the @entity145 : ‘ the residents of @entity15 have for a long time been sold a lie by their @entity17 mp			1
that ’s why they ’ll welcome the opportunity to express the way they feel about it very soon			0
‘ conservatives will present the opportunity to start afresh with a hard - working local mp who gets on with looking after her constituents			2
’ it is understood that the @entity39 will formally select local mother @entity129 , their candidate in 2010 , to fight the seat again			2
she famously confronted @entity159 over cuts to special schools in the 2005 election campaign			0
her chances of success have been boosted by @entity167 leader @entity166 ’s decision not to stand			1
labour sources are hoping for a strong showing , but are thought to privately accept they have little chances of winning			0
but @entity17 chief whip @entity171 will today move the writ to trigger a by - election in @entity15 in just over three weeks – before the party has even selected a candidate			1
former @entity17 frontbencher dr @entity176 , who fronts the hacked off campaign for a press law , last night ruled himself out , as has @entity17 council leader @entity181			1
a @entity39 victory in @entity15 , which would require a 3.5 per cent swing , would be a shattering blow for mr @entity2			2
no prime minister since @entity186 at the height of her @entity189 popularity has managed to gain a seat in a by - election .			2

tories and @entity17 will battle it out for seat *vacated* by disgraced mp
@entity197 triggered when @entity4 stood down from *parliament*
@entity167 leader @entity166 has ruled out standing in @entity15
