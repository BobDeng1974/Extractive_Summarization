it is the kind of eagle - eyed observation of which even @entity2 would have been proud			1
indeed , while the super-sleuth was busy solving his latest mystery on screen , armchair fans appeared more interested in deciphering some elementary errors in the @entity10 episode of the hit @entity12 drama			1
nearly ten million viewers – the show 's biggest audience – tuned in to find out how @entity17 's character had survived his rooftop plunge at the end of the previous series			1
in the opening sequence , viewers desperate to know how the detective had faked his own death saw @entity2 attached to a bungee rope and springing back up the side of the building , while his assistant @entity41 was hypnotised by illusionist @entity42 in the street below			1
a latex mask of @entity2 was then placed over the body of @entity46 , giving @entity2 time to make his exit			1
however , this was revealed to be only a conspiracy theory			0
a second version of events was then offered that showed @entity2 pushing a lookalike dummy off the building			2
he is then shown giving @entity56 a kiss			0
finally , @entity2 seemingly confesses the real plot , suggesting he landed on a giant airbag , which was swiftly removed while he was covered in fake blood on the pavement by a team of helpers			1
dr @entity41 was deliberately knocked over by a bicycle , giving @entity2 time to place a squash ball under his arm and briefly stop his pulse when the doctor felt his wrist for signs of life			1
dr @entity41 aboard what appears to be a @entity75 tube which then inexplicably passes through a succession of @entity77 stations curious : @entity41 later emerges from @entity81 station , back in the direction he had presumably just travelled from but as well as concentrating on the storyline , thousands of viewers gleefully pointed out continuity errors			1
at the start of the 90 - minute show , viewers saw @entity89 as dr @entity91 , where he appeared to travel along three lines without switching trains			2
in another segment in which @entity2 and @entity41 are investigating a train journey made by a suspect , @entity2 concludes that the ' five - minute ' journey between @entity98 and @entity99 must have lasted ten minutes			1
in reality the one - stop journey takes less than two minutes			0
the pair later investigate @entity104 footage showing a man climbing aboard a @entity106 to travel one stop between @entity98 to @entity99 which is on the @entity108 the man has vanished by the time the train arrives at ' @entity99 ' - which commuters will recognise is not the district line platform at the real station ... and what would a @entity75 train doing at a district line station anyway ? as the pair enter @entity98 station , which is served by the @entity120 and jubilee lines , they are inexplicably shown walking past a sign for the @entity123			1
viewers also pointed out that the carriage , which was shown carrying just one passenger , would have been full of people travelling home because it was the last train of the evening			2
one fan , @entity129 , wrote : ' might have enjoyed @entity2 more if there were n't so many inaccurate facts about the @entity27 , wrong lines , wrong stations , wrong times ! ' @entity135 added : ' more confused by @entity2 's appalling knowledge of the tube than how he fell			2
' all change : the sleuth and his companion arrive at @entity98 which is on the @entity143 lines in another shot from wednesday night 's episode @entity146 : but moments later the pair are then seen making their way to a platform on the @entity123 the crime fighters walk along a section of the @entity154 to a stationary train that has been rigged with explosives which is supposedly underneath the houses of @entity158 episode two will be broadcast on sunday , with the third and final episode next weekend			0
the much - anticipated return of the programme , which was last shown two years ago , drew a peak audience of 9.7million for its first five minutes			0
it had the highest audience of the day and was way ahead of the 7.5million viewers who saw the opening episode of the first series in 2010			2
so will writers @entity169 and @entity171 reveal all in a later episode ? a total of 9.2 million viewers tuned in to watch , a 33.8 per cent share of the audience - @entity2 's highest ever launch			1
by comparison , the first ever episode had 7.1m viewers and a 28.6 per cent share			0
@entity169 said : ' thrilling news on overnight ratings for @entity2			2
a tribute to the team who work so hard , and with such pride , on the show , and of course to the genius of sir @entity190			0
reaction : dozens of viewers took to @entity194 to point out the inaccuracies ' it 's proof that audiences will show up if you give them what they want - though we ca n't throw @entity17 off a roof every week			0
' it beat the tv premiere of the final @entity205 film in the @entity207 ratings war			0
just over five million watched @entity205 and the @entity208			0
while the updated detective pulled in just over a third of all viewers , the wizard drew one in five			0
the apparently genuine explanation in @entity215 of how @entity2 faked his own death did not convince a number of viewers			1
the detective claimed that after falling safely on to an airbag that is quickly removed , he sets about fooling his assistant @entity41 that he has suffered fatal injuries			2
he has fake blood applied and then slips a squash ball under his arm to try to cut off the blood supply and stop the pulse in his wrist			0
if a ball is squeezed in the armpit , it compresses the brachial artery , stopping the blood flow to the radial artery			0
he managed to fool @entity41 , who checked @entity2 's pulse by feeling his wrist			1
however , one critic suggested that the plan was flawed as doctors more commonly check the carotid pulse in the neck , rather than the radial pulse in the wrist , which would have rendering @entity2 ' plan useless			2
medical professionals are also usually required to take several pulse readings from different areas when examining patients			0
in addition , the technique of using a ball to restrict blood flow stops the pulse in only one arm			0
had @entity41 chosen to take @entity2 's pulse in his other wrist , his plan would have been exposed .			1

much anticipated *season* three opener brought in almost *10m* viewers
however , a series of elementary errors get people talking on *twitter*
@entity41 travels on @entity75 through @entity266 on the @entity267
he then inexplicably emerges from @entity81 station
mystery deepens as he and @entity2 face an underground bomb plot
