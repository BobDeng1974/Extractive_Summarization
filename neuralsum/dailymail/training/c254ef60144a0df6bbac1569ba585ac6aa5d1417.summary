@entity0 has warned of an impending asteroid pass - and says it will be the closest until 2027			1
the asteroid , designated 2004 @entity3 , will safely pass about three times the distance of @entity5 to the moon on january 26			1
it will be the closest by any known space rock this large until asteroid 1999 @entity9 flies past @entity5 in 2027			2
see the asteroid 's route below at the time of its closest approach on january 26 , the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) from @entity5			2
due to its orbit around the sun , the asteroid is currently only visible by astronomers with large telescopes who are located in the southern hemisphere			0
but by jan. 26 , the space rock 's changing position will make it visible to those in the northern hemisphere			0
from its reflected brightness , astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile ( 0.5 kilometers ) in size			1
at the time of its closest approach on january 26 , the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) from @entity5			2
' monday , january 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 @entity3 will get to @entity5 for at least the next 200 years , ' said @entity34 , who is retiring as manager of @entity0 's @entity36 at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , after 16 years in the position			1
' and while it poses no threat to @entity5 for the foreseeable future , it 's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid , so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more			1
' one way @entity0 scientists plan to learn more about 2004 @entity3 is to observe it with microwaves			1
@entity0 's @entity52 antenna at @entity53 , @entity39 , and the @entity54 in @entity55 will attempt to acquire science data and radar - generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to @entity5			1
' when we get our radar data back the day after the flyby , we will have the first detailed images , ' said radar astronomer @entity65 of @entity37 , the principal investigator for the @entity53 radar observations of the asteroid			0
' at present , we know almost nothing about the asteroid , so there are bound to be surprises			0
' do n't panic ! @entity0 says ' while it poses no threat to @entity5 for the foreseeable future , it 's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid , so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more			1
' asteroid 2004 @entity78 was initially discovered on jan. 30 , 2004 by a telescope of the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) survey in @entity82 , @entity83			2
the asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars			0
' i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself , ' said @entity34			0
' asteroids are something special			0
not only did asteroids provide @entity5 with the building blocks of life and much of its water , but in the future , they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources			2
' they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system			0
there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up			0

2004 @entity3 will pass about three times the distance of @entity5 to the moon
estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile ( 0.5 kilometers ) in size
@entity0 says it poses no threat to @entity5 ' for the foreseeable future '
