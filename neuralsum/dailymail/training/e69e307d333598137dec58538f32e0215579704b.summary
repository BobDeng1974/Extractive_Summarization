yet they still require the same amount of work for controllers			0

the @entity76 was typing in flight - plan information for each plane and printing it out on a strip			2

q : what are delays like now ? a : the @entity76 said monday that the takeoff and landing rate at @entity3 was at 80 percent of the rate last week at the same time			1

q : in light of the fire , will the @entity76 change how it operates and secures these facilities ? a : @entity106 said the agency might need to treat some buildings , like the center in @entity184 , differently because they are more critical to the national air traffic system than others			1
over the next 30 days , the @entity76 will conduct a review of its contingency plans for unexpected events like friday 's fire , as well as security at its facilities			1
@entity147 and its regional partners were reportedly the hardest hit canceling 1,579 flights , according to flight tracking site @entity151			0
