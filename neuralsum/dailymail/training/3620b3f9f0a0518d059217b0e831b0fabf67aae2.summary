would you choose to cruise on a ship that is owned by @entity3 , crewed by @entity3 and almost exclusively filled with @entity3 ? not sure ? i had my doubts , too			1
would the food be super-sausaged , schnitzeled and sauerkrauted , the entertainment a mix of oompah bands and the slapping of bottoms in lederhosen ? would i be ‘ @entity13 ’ , afloat in a sea of @entity16 banter ? would anyone speak @entity18 ? not a sauerkraut sort of place : europa 2 has been ranked as the world 's best cruise ship maybe it was time to shake off all those deeply embedded prejudices and step on board @entity21			1
one good reason for choosing to cruise on @entity21 is that she is now rated the world ’s best by the authoritative @entity31 guide to cruising , with five - plus stars			1
guess who @entity21 knocked off the no 1 perch when she arrived in 2012 ? her older sister , @entity21 1			1
that ’s sibling rivalry for you			2
@entity21 is a space ship			1
she has the highest ratio of space per passenger than any ship afloat , with wide corridors , high ceilings and floods of natural light			2
designed to appeal to a younger market , her look is gently contemporary			0
there is even a @entity52 and a @entity53 among her 1,000 original works of art. other high - spec components include a 15 - metre heated pool with a fully retractable roof , an excellent spa , a cookery school , seven different restaurants , a jazz club , a plush theatre and a cigar bar with 37 different varieties of gin			1
all very elegant : the ship 's atrium comes with its own grand piano and a definite air of refinement like everyone else in the mainly @entity3 crew , @entity73 the barman could not only speak @entity18 but could even do a convincing range of accents , @entity78 to @entity79			1
each of the 250 suites comes with a verandah and a bed that can be hardened or softened at the touch of a button			0
i soaked in a proper , full - size tub while watching a tv screen embedded in the bathroom mirror			2
to my right , i could see global atrocities on @entity94 , then , turning the other cheek , i tuned into a view of the ocean , framed by the arid landscapes of the @entity100 coast			0
more than a simple ship : step on board , and you feel that you are checking in to a luxury hotel i had joined the ship in @entity106 and sailed due south to @entity108 , home to the immense mosque of @entity111 , a hassle - free souk with the usual spread of pouffes , banana slippers , mint tea sets and fashionable candle lamps , and @entity118 , owned and hostessed by ex- @entity120 diplomat @entity119 - and modelled on the one created in @entity121 for the @entity124 / @entity123 movie			1
at @entity125 , i went to the beach			0
an odd thing about cruising is that while the focus is all about the sea , you rarely get a chance to dip you toes in it			0
luxury on @entity21 , curiously , is as much about what it does n’t have as well as what ’s there			1
you wo n’t find a casino , entertainment overload , set times or places for dining or formal nights			0
i did n’t see a tie all week , let alone a black one			0
and another thing missing was noise , with none of the usual barrage of announcements telling you what the weather is like and where the napkin - folding lessons are taking place			2
it was also easy being a briton on board			2
@entity158 , a waitress from @entity159 , told me that in the crew ’s quarters there is a huge photo collage of every passenger , which helps them put names to faces before we try to order our first breakfast of @entity170 ( porridge ) or @entity172 ( scrambled egg with bacon and sausage )			0
night time attractions : the ship has a host of restaurants and bars where you can while away the evening of course , the most luxurious ship in the world does n’t come cheap			2
reckon on £ 500 a day , including gratuities , but excluding shore excursions , drinks and flights			0
but perhaps the biggest surprise was finding that @entity21 2 ’s owner , @entity190 , is now part of the vast @entity193 family , making her a cousin , once removed , of @entity195 , @entity196 and the rest of that familiar clan			1
the @entity199 ( 020 7723 2450 , www.cruisepeople.co.uk ) offers a seven - night cruise aboard @entity21 from £ 3,570 per person , departing @entity202 , @entity203 on october 10 , 2015 , and sailing to @entity205 , @entity206			1
ports of call include @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			0
@entity213 includes full board , mini-bar in the suite , entertainment , port fees and basic gratuities			0
