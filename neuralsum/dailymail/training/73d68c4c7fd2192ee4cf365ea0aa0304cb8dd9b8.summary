@entity7 , a @entity54 , made national headlines over a month *ago* after claiming a couple left her an offensive note instead of a tip
dozens donated money to support the waitress which she claimed she was donating to a *veteran* 's charity

the restaurant announced her termination on @entity27 saturday shortly after @entity16 revealed she was returning donations
*gay* charity which first featured her tale of prejudice told @entity16 of their disappointment and users who received refunds say they were ' *gullible* '
