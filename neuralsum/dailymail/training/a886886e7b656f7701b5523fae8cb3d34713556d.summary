by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 23 january 2013 detectives are investigating the discovery of human remains that had been hidden in the foundations of a pizzeria recently confiscated as part of an operation against the @entity8			1
the grim find was made as workmen carried out renovations at the restaurant , which also sits upon the site of an old roman road			0
sources said the skeleton was found in the cellar of the building which dates back to the 1600s , although the bones appeared to have been from a ' far more recent period '			1
behind the facade : the human remains were found in the foundations of a pizzeria with connections to the mafia in the picturesque town of @entity28 , @entity29 officers and forensic pathologists were called to the building by shocked workers just days after ornate frescoes were also uncovered at the former pizzeria			1
following the discovery of the artwork at the pizzeria known as @entity43 in @entity28 , near @entity44 , experts from @entity38 's superintendency of art were called in to examine the works			1
but they will now have to leave as the building is now in the hands of the local police , putting plans to turn it into an old people 's home on hold			1
it had initially been seized and closed down by anti-mob investigators as part of a crackdown on the @entity58 clan , who operate in the area and are part of the @entity63 mafia known as the ' @entity64 , who have spread north from their stronghold in the deep south of @entity38 around the port of @entity69			2
godfather : @entity71 , jailed in 1992 , bossed over the @entity58 clan which led to the closure of the pizzeria a police spokesman in @entity28 said : ' the building has been sealed off and investigators are on site			1
' they will be working to establish exactly how old the skeleton is and if possible try and identify it			0
' at this point we are not ruling anything out , especially - given that the property was owned by the ' @entity64 - we need to see if there is a possible criminal connection			0
' godfather of the clan was @entity71 , 67 , who was convicted and jailed in 1992 for life after being found guilty of murder , extortion and drug trafficking			0
the clan boss had a fleet of @entity98 and @entity99 cars as well as a string of pizzerias and restaurants across @entity28 and @entity44 which were popular with @entity38 celebrities			1
he ruled the area around @entity28 with an iron grip , frequently ordering rivals to be executed			1
in one hit , six opponents were gunned down while he himself was also targeted but escaped leaving his would - be assassins killing two innocent passers - by instead			0
in true mafia style he then invited the rival mobster who had ordered the hit to a ' clear the air dinner ' where he was shot dead			0
and while he is still in prison , police say his clan still continues to influence the area and he manages to impose his will even from behind prison bars			2
the ' @entity64 has been growing in influence in northern @entity38 in recent years and is now said to be more powerful than its better - known @entity124 counterparts , with its fingers deep in the financial and fashion capital of @entity44			2
two years ago in a famous show trial dozens of ' @entity130 were sentenced to total jail terms of more than 1,000 years by a @entity44 judge			2
police say the ' @entity64 controls the lucrative drugs supply from @entity135 into @entity136 and operations to crack it are difficult as there are few informants			0
one of the most infamous events including the ' @entity64 was the infamous @entity141 of 2007 when six mobsters were gunned down in a pizzeria in the @entity145 city after travelling more than 1,000 miles from @entity69 to settle a long running feud			0
the @entity148 's power has increased in recent years and it dominates the drugs market in @entity136 especially cocaine with investigators estimating it makes more than Â£ 30 billion a year - equivalent to the gdp of @entity154 - and there are also said to be connections in @entity157 .			0
