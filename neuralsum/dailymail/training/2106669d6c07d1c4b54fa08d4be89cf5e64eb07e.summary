women could soon be able to buy their own version of @entity2			2
the pill , called @entity4 , is said to increase a woman ’s desire for sex , and make it more satisfying when it happens			2
it uses a combination of testosterone and a @entity2 - like drug , which work on both the brain and body to boost flagging libido			2
libido : previous attempts to make ' female viagra ' have failed because women 's low sex drive often stems from psychological factors with trial results described as ‘ very impressive ’ , it could be on bedside cabinets within three years			1
but experts warned that the firms which make it will be under pressure to prove that the drug will not turn women into nymphomaniacs			1
with worldwide sales of @entity2 at nearly £ 1.5billion a year , scientists have long tried to create a version for the female market			0
but previous attempts have failed to make the grade , because low female libido often stems from psychological as much as physical factors			0
@entity41 firm @entity40 believes it has cracked the problem with a two - in - one pill , which should be taken three and a half hours before sex			2
smaller than an aspirin , it contains a @entity2 - like drug in a testosterone and mint coating			0
separately , neither drug can lift flagging female libido but , together , they are said to provide the necessary boost			0
male version : worldwide sales of @entity2 at nearly £ 1.5billion a year , but there is not yet a female equivalent the physical effect of @entity2 magnifies the effect of testosterone on the brain ’s pleasure centres			0
a trial involving more than 200 women in the @entity64 has just finished			1
the full results are still under wraps but @entity40 founder @entity67 describes them as ‘ very , very promising ’			0
dr @entity67 began researching female emotion after a girlfriend broke his heart when he was in his 20s			0
he said that with the drug , women made love more often and were more likely to reach orgasm			1
but some suffered side - effects including headaches and flushing of the face or neck			0
he now plans to carry out a larger trial , and hopes to put the drug on the market in @entity86 and the @entity64 at the end of 2016			1
dr @entity67 believes the pills will be most popular with long - married women , for whom sex may have become a bore			1
but some doctors have warned the pills may be a little too much in demand			0
dr @entity95 , a @entity64 expert in female sexual health , told the @entity97 that drug companies such as @entity40 will be under pressure to prove they are not turning women into nymphomaniacs			2
some experts fear @entity4 will put women under pressure to perform , while others are sceptical about whether the pills can boost female sex drive			1
they point out that a tablet is not going to fix a broken relationship or ease the stresses of work and childcare			0
dr @entity67 says that up to 43 per cent of women suffer from a low sex drive at some point in their lives and that , far from turning women into sex maniacs , the drug will simply raise a low libido to normal levels			1
dr @entity124 , one of the team of scientists that discovered and developed the male impotence drug @entity2 , described @entity128 as ‘ an interesting concept ’ .			1
