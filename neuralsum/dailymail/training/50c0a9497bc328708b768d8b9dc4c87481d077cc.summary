@entity4 , 47 , faces first - degree murder charges in the death of high school junior 17 - year - old @entity8 on november 23 , 2012			1
the white , middle - aged software engineer opened fire on a car with four black teenage boys inside that was parked next to him in the parking lot of a @entity31 gas station convenience store in northeast @entity10			1
@entity4 has said he feared for his life , drawing comparisons to the trial of @entity35 , the former central @entity10 neighborhood watchman who was acquitted last year of murder after saying he shot a 17 - year - old unarmed black teenager , @entity37 , in self - defense			1
@entity4 said he had asked the teenagers to turn down the volume of their music			2
from the back passenger seat , @entity8 refused and the two exchanged words			2
@entity4 says he opened fire because he saw the barrel of a gun pointed out the back window at him , though police found no weapon			1
the case has garnered national and international media attention because of the racial overtones and the self - defense claims			0
like @entity35 , @entity4 said he feared a black teenager who was unarmed			2
if found guilty , @entity4 faces life in prison			1
prosecutors say they wo n't seek the death penalty			0
@entity4 's attorney , @entity61 , has filed motions asking the judge not to allow references in the trial to comments @entity4 made in jailhouse letters or phone calls where he referred to @entity8 and to some inmates as ' thugs ' , and made other ' alleged racial comments , ' according to court documents			1
life lost : police say @entity8 was unarmed , and no weapon was found in the suv where he was riding in a letter that @entity4 sent to a local television reporter , he described @entity79 as a thug			1
' this case has never been about loud music , ' @entity4 wrote to news anchor @entity83 in october			2
' this case is about a local thug threatening to kill me because i dared to ask him to turn the music down			0
' @entity61 also asked that the judge bar the prosecution from referring to @entity8 as a ' victim '			2
the media attention will also thrust back into the spotlight @entity31 's state attorney @entity93 , the special prosecutor who was chosen by @entity10 governor @entity94 to handle the @entity35 case			0
