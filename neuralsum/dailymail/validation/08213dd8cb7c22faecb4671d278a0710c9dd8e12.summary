the beautifully - crafted 1:64 scale model of the luxury @entity10 liner was made to celebrate the actual ship 's launch in 1906			1
the model will be auctioned in may - 100 years after @entity4 's ill - fated sister ship @entity15 was sunk by a @entity17 u-boat killing 1,198 passengers and crew			1

@entity4 made her maiden voyage the following year , setting off from @entity39 for @entity40 on november 16 , 1907			2
weighing 31,938 tons , the ship had enough space for 563 1st class passengers , 464 in 2nd class and 1,138 in 3rd class			0
in 1909 , just two years after its maiden voyage , @entity4 obtained the @entity49 title for the fastest eastbound and westbound journeys across the @entity51			1
it held the title for 22 years until 1929 when it was surpassed by the @entity17 liner bremen			0
as part of @entity34 's original deal with the government , the ship was made available to the @entity59 during times of national emergency			0
so on august 4 1914 when @entity10 declared war on @entity17 , it was redirected from its path to @entity40 and docked at @entity65 to be named an armed cruise liner			0
the following week however the @entity4 and the @entity15 , its sister ship , were relieved of @entity58 duties			1
she was docked at @entity39 with dwindling demand for transatlantic passages during the war until may 2015 when the @entity15 was sunk by @entity74 torpedoes			2
returned to service , the @entity4 was used to transport troops during the @entity77 before being turned into a hospital ship			2

now outdated and with the companies ' required to reduce their fleet , she was sold for scrap the following year			0
the wooden replica was loaned by @entity99 , the company that built both ships for cruise line firm @entity34 , to the @entity102 in @entity103 in 1938			1
the institution displayed it in their @entity106 which was closed in 2012 and the model was removed and put into storage			0

' @entity34 commissioned @entity99 to build the @entity15 and the @entity4 in response to the increasing threat of its domination of the @entity132 passenger trade posed by the @entity133 , which went on to build the @entity134			1
the @entity4 held the prestigious @entity49 title for the fastest transatlantic voyage for 22 years until it was beaten 1929 by the @entity17 liner @entity138			2
a scale model of the @entity15 was also made but after the ship was torpedoed with the loss of 1,198 passengers in 1915 it was turned into a second miniature version of the @entity145 as it was thought it could have brought bad luck			1
that model still exists and its last known location was on board the @entity150			0
the boat and model were both built by @entity99 , and the model was lent to @entity103 's @entity102 in 1938 , where it stayed until 2012 the 1:64 scale model of the ship was built by the @entity99 to commemorate ithe launch of the @entity4 - which went on to break the record for the fastest sail across the @entity51 @entity103 - based auctioneer @entity114 said : ' the model is extremely decorative and detailed			1
