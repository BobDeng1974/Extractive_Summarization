@entity1 - winning snowboarder @entity0 has revealed that she is retiring after being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition			1
the 25 - year - old athlete , who won gold for the halfpipe at the @entity6 in @entity7 last february , made the announcement on her @entity10 page			1
' the past few months have been really difficult , ' she wrote			2
' i 've met with many specialists and they all confirmed i have congenital cervical stenosis of my spine , a condition i was born with and never knew i had until a recent fall in @entity17 led me to get an mri			1
' i am so thankful for my friends , family and sponsors for their support throughout this time			2
it 's been an unbelievable run and i look forward to my next quarter century			1
' speaking with @entity38 , she revealed that after taking a fall from a jump in @entity17 in late october , she was unable to feel any part of her body and could not move for two minutes			1
' it was hard to comprehend what was happening , ' she said			2
eventually the movement came back but , still troubled by a pain on her neck after returning home to @entity49 , she went to a spine doctor , who told her she would never snowboard again			1
' i was n't ready to hear it , ' she said			0
' it was the worst conversation of my life			0
' she met with other specialists , who all repeated the diagnosis , leaving her angry and wishing she had n't found out			0
she kept the truth from her loved ones			0
trouble : @entity60 team physician dr. @entity59 shows her mri and points to the kink in her spinal cord that would put her at risk of paralysis if she continued to compete in snowboarding ' i think by lying , i convinced myself it was n't happening , ' she said			0
' i could n't accept it yet			0
' but the day before her 25th birthday , she met with @entity60 team physician @entity59 , who had been her doctor since she was a child , and he told her the same thing : she had been born with a narrowing of her spine in her neck that could leave her unable to walk if she took a fall			1
' there is no room to allow for any movement of the spinal cord when the spine flexes and bends , to prevent the cord from getting kinked or pinched , ' he told @entity38			1
' in @entity0 's spine , there is no room for error			1
it 's only by the grace of @entity87 that nothing worse happened before this injury			2
' if she continued to snowboard and took another fall , she could be paralyzed			1
he said his heart sank when he saw her mri because : ' i knew it was over			0
' slowly she started breaking the news to loved ones and there were more tears , she said			0
winner : @entity0 , pictured competing at @entity7 , said at first she refused to accept the diagnosis @entity104 : she is pictured center at @entity7 last year with bronze medallist , @entity106 ( left ) from the @entity107 , and silver medallist , @entity110 's @entity109			1
she said she is grateful she did not learn about the condition earlier but she is now coming to terms with the diagnosis , and is thankful that she did not learn about it too early - when she would have missed out on a snowboarding career - or too late			2
i can still snowboard , ' she told @entity38			0
' i just have to keep my feet on the ground			0
i still want to be a professional snowboarder , i just have to figure out what that means			2
' @entity0 unexpectedly won gold in @entity7 last february , beating tough competition from the previous three @entity6 champions , @entity109 , @entity106 and @entity125			1
' the next quarter of my life is going to be extremely different from the first			0
i have to figure out how to make it just as great			0
