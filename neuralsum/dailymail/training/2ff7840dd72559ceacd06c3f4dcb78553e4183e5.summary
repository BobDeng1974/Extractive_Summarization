sometimes little feet get tired and need a bit of help from mum - even if those little feet happen to belong to a polar bear			2
so it 's lucky this particular mama bear was willing to be the cub 's ride for the day			0
this adorable pictures is just one of the photos captured by photographer @entity13 , who spent 10 years capturing the bond between newborn and mother			1
the @entity41 photographer , 42 , caught the youngsters exploring their snowy worlds for the first time as their watchful mothers looked on			0
but if the experience was n't special enough , mr @entity13 even managed to capture such magical moments as seeing a mother with three surviving cubs - a very rare occurrence			2
mother and cub seen peeking out from their den - which will be their home until about march or april this adventurous cub is trying to get a better look at the world around him with the help of mum polar bear cub keeping warm in the freezing temperatures this mother looks a little less than impressed after her cubs turn her into a climbing frame it is hard to believe these cubs will one day be the same size as their parents this mother does n't look too impressed with being photographed pregnant polar bears build their dens in snowdrifts along mountain slopes , hills near sea ice or in banks of snow on the frozen sea , according to @entity81			1
the expectant mother - who has fattened herself up during september - scrapes a tunnel into the snow , digging two chambers where she will give birth to her brood towards the end of the year			0
the family will only leave the den in march and april , when the weather gets a bit warmer and the cubs are strong enough to make the trek to the sea ice			0
three cubs is very rare for polar bears , who are more likely to have twins this cub appears to be using his mother as a sofa polar bear cub holds on for dear life as mum sniffs out some food looks like these cubs are having a bit of rough and tumble polar bear cub peaks out from between mum 's legs and these two seem to be vying for mum 's attention			1

@entity13 spent 10 years taking pictures of polar bears and their cub
the 42 - year - old had to get a special permit to capture the bear 's denning area in @entity34 , @entity124
the result is this *series* of *stunning* images - certain to melt even the coldest heart
