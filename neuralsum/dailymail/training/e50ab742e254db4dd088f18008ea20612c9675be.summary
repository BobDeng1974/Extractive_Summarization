four to six weeks or , in football terms , about eight games			0
that 's how long @entity3 must make do without @entity4			1
the same @entity4 who , on may 13 , 2012 , scored a goal timed at 93:20 to win the @entity7 title			1
the same @entity4 that less than three weeks ago scored a @entity9 hat - trick to single - handedly dismantle @entity10			1
talk of when @entity13 's season would be curtailed by a supposedly inevitable @entity15 injury has muted			2
in a cruel twist , it is @entity18 who must cope without his mvp , not @entity21			2
@entity3 striker @entity4 lies injured holding his knee on the pitch at the @entity24 against @entity25 @entity4 's knee injury will keep him out for four to six weeks , and has been confirmed by @entity18 an emotional @entity4 catches his breathe on the sidelines as he is substituted with the injury on saturday @entity4 was able to walk off unaided but a scan revealed the extent of the unfortunate injury to his knee @entity4 leaves the @entity24 pitch with an injury that could keep him out for up to six weeks through winter @entity4 ’s final contribution of 2014 was 75 seconds on december 6			1
@entity3 beat @entity25 without him , but only through the softest of penalties that should never have been			1
more than 90 minutes , injury time included , and they could not penetrate @entity25 without referee @entity41 ’s help			2
whether @entity4 is to @entity3 what @entity42 was to @entity44 remains to be seen			1
but , as luck would have it , they could hardly have asked for a more inviting fixture list			0
@entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , all loitering in the bottom seven of the @entity7 , await the champions between december 13 and january 1			1
@entity55 , owner of @entity3 , did not strike oil to tinker with a toy			2
his £ 200million @entity58 is the finest in world football and 15 points are expected			0
followed by @entity62 in the @entity64 third round , then @entity25 , @entity61 and @entity13 , by which time @entity4 is expected to be fit			1
come late january , we will know if the sky blue eyes have blinked			0
the time of @entity4 's @entity7 title - winning goal is on the wall of @entity3 's £ 200million training complex @entity4 's hat - trick against @entity10 kept @entity3 in the @entity9 less than three weeks ago city remain in the @entity9 after going to @entity75 as they made their way into the last 16 a comparison of @entity3 's performances with and without @entity4 since his debut in the @entity7 the sad truth is , no matter how appealing the fixtures , he is a bigger loss than @entity18 would care to admit			1
with @entity4 , their @entity7 win percentage is 69.6			1
without , it dips to 63 , they score less goals ( 2 to 2.3 ) , have fewer shots ( 12.8 to 13.4 ) and do n’t take as many points ( 2.1 to 2.2 )			0
over at @entity89 a few may argue they have the best in the @entity7 , though @entity15 ’s 11 goals in 999 minutes to @entity4 ’s 14 in 1,054 are inferior and he 's enduring a barren run			1
@entity4 's form of 2014 obliterates 2012 and 2013 , too , as shown below			1
in layman 's terms , @entity3 have lost almost a goal a game ( 0.93 ) and five shots ( 4.93 ) from one of the @entity7 's deadliest finishers			1
scratch beneath the surface and @entity18 ’s reliance shows			2
@entity104 last scored in the @entity7 on january 18 , @entity105 on december 21 , 2013 , and @entity106 on may 11			2
the nearest colleagues to @entity4 's 14 are @entity108 and @entity109 on four			2
@entity4 's form this @entity7 season ( far left column ) has obliterated his averages in the past two years , and @entity13 striker @entity15 only has him beat in shot accuracy ( far right column ) @entity4 's form of 2014 obliterates 2012 and 2013 but injury will see the striker out for up to six weeks 19 - @entity4 6 - @entity108 5 - @entity117 4 - @entity118 , @entity109 2 - @entity119 , @entity120 1 - @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity123 @entity118 has two , and @entity123 , so new he is absent from the club website ’s official squad list , has none			1
can @entity18 trust them to fill the void ? would you ? @entity133 would n’t , hence his suggestion @entity4 ’s injury could cost them a third @entity7 title			1
it would n’t be the first time			0
in 2008 , @entity138 said @entity140 ’s broken leg and dislocated ankle at @entity142 cost @entity61			0
they were six points clear in february , before finishing third			0
in 2010 , sir @entity145 was convinced an ankle injury to @entity149 cost @entity147 , who ended a point behind @entity13			2
@entity152 pundit @entity133 tweeted on sunday that @entity4 's injury could decide the @entity7 title city manager @entity18 will be without his key striker until 2015 and must rely on others now @entity3 , however , have prevailed since @entity4 ’s absence , even without a true lone striker , which the average positions in their last four matches demonstrate , shown below			1
higher than any other player , @entity4 ( no 16 ) was supported by @entity109 ( 35 ) and @entity106 ( 8 ) against @entity162 and @entity53 , with @entity163 ( 15 ) glued to the right wing			1
they won 3 - 0 at @entity166 ’s and 4 - 1 at the @entity167			1
@entity4 off , replaced by @entity123 who , in turn , was substituted for @entity118 ( 10 ) on 63 minutes			2
@entity106 averaged the highest position with @entity105 ( 7 )			0
and so to the @entity171 job at the @entity172 in @entity75			0
no @entity173 , @entity108 or @entity119 , either			0
only the second match city played since 2011 with those four not starting			0
@entity118 ( 10 ) , one blank away from matching the longest drought of his @entity3 career , was given the unenviable task of deputising for @entity4			1
@entity3 average positions with @entity4 ( no 16 ) : vs @entity162 ( left ) and vs @entity53 ( right ) @entity3 average positions without @entity4 : vs @entity25 ( left ) and vs @entity180 ( right ) @entity118 , one blank away from matching the longest drought of his @entity3 career , deputised for @entity4 @entity18 dug in his heels , denying @entity3 are a one - man club			1
‘ it is one thing that a player can be in a very good moment as @entity4 was until today but i do n’t think he has carried us			2
every big team must have important players like @entity4 , ’ he said			0
‘ i suppose ( @entity191 ) @entity191 is very important for @entity192 , ( @entity193 ) @entity193 is very important for @entity194 but neither of those teams are all about just one player			0
half chances came and went for understudy @entity118 but , through @entity106 and @entity120 , they won 2 - 0			1
@entity106 ( centre ) scored as @entity3 beat @entity180 2 - 0 to do the @entity171 job without injured striker @entity4 @entity3 goalkeeper @entity203 ( left ) applauds the travelling fans that went to @entity75 and emerged with a 2 - 0 win vs @entity53 : 64.6 % - 761 vs @entity25 : 51.4 % - 484 vs @entity180 : 42.6 - 421 against @entity49 , they will try to retrieve their passing game , which has diminished as opposition got harder			1
at @entity53 , they enjoyed 64.6 per cent possession and made 761 passes			0
at @entity25 , it plunged to 51.4 possession and 484 passes			0
at @entity180 , even further to 42.6 possession and 421			0
crosses went up , too , which @entity3 rarely turn to when the 5ft 8in @entity4 is clinging on the shoulders of the defence			1
but football is a results business			0
two down , six or so to go			0
@entity49 at the @entity24 next			0
so , as @entity133 suggests , should we consider them done for ? sir @entity138 briefly thought so on may 13 two years ago then , at 93:20 , he paid the price			1
@entity4 will be missed by @entity223 up front but @entity3 have shown they are no one - man team march , 2012 : injures foot against @entity13			1
misses two games : @entity3 draw both			2
august , 2012 : injures knee against @entity162			0
misses three games : @entity3 win one , draw two			2
april , 2013 : injures hamstring against @entity234			0
misses next game : city lose against @entity237			0
september , 2013 : picks up knock against @entity147			0
misses next game : city lose against @entity240			0
january , 2014 : injures calf against @entity237			0
misses three games , @entity3 win one , draw with @entity244 and lose against @entity13			2
@entity4 is carried off on a stretcher after an injury in @entity3 's match against @entity162 in august 2012			1

@entity4 *damaged* knee *ligaments* in 1 - 0 win against @entity25
@entity133 suggests his injury could cost @entity3 the @entity7 title
@entity3 's next five @entity7 games without @entity4 are against @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53
@entity18 relies on the @entity258 striker as his *statistics* suggest
you can never write @entity3 off as shown against @entity262 and @entity10
