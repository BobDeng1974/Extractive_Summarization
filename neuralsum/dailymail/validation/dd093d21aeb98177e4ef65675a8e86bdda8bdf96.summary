they 're not the usual dishes one thinks of when considering the tastes and palate of young children			2
but in one restaurant in @entity7 , moules mariniere , wood fired pizzas , ratatouille , and crispy salt and pepper squid sit alongside more prosaic offerings such as burgers , and fish and chips			1
the dishes served at @entity17 in @entity18 were designed and approved by the restaurant owner 's six - year - old daughter , after whom the restaurant is named			1
@entity22 with her mother @entity24 in the kitchen of the eponymous restaurant in @entity7 the new menu was given the thumbs up by the child testers aged between two and eight - years - old the eaterie 's new kids ' menu was devised entirely by @entity22 , who was aged just six months when the restaurant in @entity34 in @entity18 , was opened by her mum @entity24			1

@entity22 said : ' it was really fun having my friends here to share the food			0
