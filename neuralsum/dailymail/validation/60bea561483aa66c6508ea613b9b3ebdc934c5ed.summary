lunch with @entity0 last sunday and dinner with @entity2 on thursday night			1
@entity3 is certainly mixing with the right company as he finalises his preparations for his tilt at the career @entity8 at the masters next month			1
not just the greats of this sport , either			0
while on a two - day trip to @entity14 last week , the @entity12 hit the gym at 6am — and was joined shortly afterwards by @entity17 - winning quarterbacks @entity18 and @entity19			1
‘ when they came in it was my cue to walk out , ’ said @entity3 , smiling			1
‘ when you think it ’s their off - season , it was quite something to see their dedication			2
they ’re both in their late 30s and it emphasised their determination to prolong their careers			0
’ @entity3 greets fans while walking to the ninth tee during a pro-am at the @entity37 amazing what a pep trip to @entity14 can do for a man — that , and a long weekend practice session with his long - time coach , @entity42			1
when last seen at the @entity43 at @entity44 10 days ago @entity3 cut a dispirited figure as he completed the second of two disappointing tournaments in @entity48			1
here at @entity52 , on the eve of his first appearance at the @entity37 , there was a spring to his stride once more			0
‘ i certainly feel a lot better about my game than i did at @entity44 , ’ he said			0
‘ and i think this course sets up well for me			0
practising the last two days has left me ruing the fact i have n’t played here in the past			2
’ @entity3 watches his tee shot on the ninth hole during a pro-am @entity37 tournament the accent was clearly on relaxation rather than reconnaissance when @entity3 took his dad @entity67 , a former scratch handicap player himself , up to @entity14 last thursday			1
‘ i think it gave him an appreciation of what it takes to play the course off the back tees , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ he ’s always asking me why i did this and that when i come off the course			0
now i think he knows what we go through			0
’ @entity3 was coy when asked about his score , noting merely that he played well on the first day			2
which probably means a 64 or 65			0
this is his last scheduled tournament before the masters in three weeks and , in the absence of eight - time winner @entity87 , the local community is certainly glad he ’s here			2
@entity3 looks over a shot during the pro-am round prior to the @entity37 @entity3 slaps hands with a young fan , while walking between holes in @entity93 @entity3 plays a shot at the @entity95 in @entity93 during the pro-am ‘ @entity3 , ’ proclaims a huge sign hanging from a house near the 18th green			1
‘ it was very nice of them to do that and it summed up the reception i ’ve had since i ’ve arrived , ’ said the 25 - year - old			0
@entity3 begins on thursday in a belter of a threeball alongside good friend @entity107 and another of @entity14 ’s highly - fancied players — gifted @entity110 @entity109			1
also in the field are world no 3 @entity112 and @entity113 , and among the @entity115 and @entity116 contingent are @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity3 has scheduled the @entity37 as his last event before the masters in three weeks as for that talk with the @entity0 , @entity3 was asking about pin placements on certain greens when @entity0 said : ‘ never forget , @entity3 — if you ’re in doubt , the middle of the green is never a bad place to be at @entity14			1
’ for a player who has certainly been guilty of playing too aggressively on occasion in the past that might prove the most sage piece of advice of all .			0
