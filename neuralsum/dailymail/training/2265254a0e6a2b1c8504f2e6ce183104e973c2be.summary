there were also two dead birds in cages a policeman chanced upon the boy who can not be named for legal reasons at the house in east @entity10 , when he visited to investigate a missing dog			1
the boy 's 21 - year - old mother was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison at @entity38 , @entity10 , for neglecting her son			1
@entity42 @entity41 who found the boy said that the conditions he encountered were ‘ the worst he had ever seen ’ , the court heard			2
@entity46 found the child on a mattress			2
he was so ill he needed a feeding tube to his stomach and had a serious bacterial infection in an open wound on his torso			0
the 4 - year - old boy was made so ill by his living conditions that he is unable to eat and has to be fed via a gastric tube judge @entity58 , @entity59 , the recorder at @entity38 , told the boy ’s mother : ‘ the neglect was over a period of two months and appears to have commenced when you moved from one home to another			1
‘ the child is only able to take food through a gastric tube			1
you lived alone with him and a very large number of animals			0
‘ the police called at your home about a missing dog and came across a scene of absolute squalor			2
‘ the house was filthy with rubbish , foodstuffs and animal faeces everywhere			1
‘ i have seen the photographs and it is shocking that anyone can let a house get into that state			0
‘ an experienced police officer described the conditions as the worst he had ever seen			0
’ a policeman who discovered the boy by chance when he went to investigate a report of a missing dog described the conditions as the worst he had ever seen @entity97 , defending , told the court her client had been suffering from depression			1
she said : ‘ the circumstances in which she found herself were escalating and worsening as time went on and of course , in addition also had a child who required more care than perhaps some other children may have done			2
‘ she accepts that she failed to care for him in the way she ought to have done			0
‘ she has shown genuine remorse and she picked herself up by the bootstraps and has made efforts to move forward			0
‘ she is well aware she might receive a custodial sentence and has written a letter to her son to be read to him if it is the case			0
the birds : when police investigated they found two dead birds in cages ‘ there will be no repeat of this behaviour			1
that does not mean she is not a young woman who clearly requires support and to examine what went wrong during the last part of last year			0
’ but judge @entity58 told the defendant , who had pleaded guilty to a charge of child neglect at an earlier hearing : ‘ although it has been argued that there was a lack of support available to you , i do not accept that argument because you had previously had support and knew it was available			0
‘ i do accept that you have had a difficult history			0
i also accept that you now acknowledge that your care was inadequate			0
‘ such mitigation can not extinguish the fact that this was very serious neglect			0
’ speaking after the hearing , a @entity150 spokesman said : ‘ cases like this which involve the ill - treatment of young children are always very hard to deal with , but we welcome this sentence			0
‘ this was a particularly appalling case of child neglect involving a vulnerable 4 - year - old boy who was living in truly shocking conditions			2
‘ the house was in a completely uninhabitable state for anyone , let alone a small child , and thankfully he is now being looked after properly			2
