the pose is unmistakable but the target beggars belief			2
arms outstretched , a hooded rioter takes aim and fires at a police helicopter hovering over a scene of carnage in the middle of a city			2
yesterday the gunman and five others convicted over a ‘ concerted attack on the police ’ were jailed for up to 30 years each after a court heard how they used guns to ambush unarmed officers before turning their fire skywards			1
the gang lured officers into the area by firebombing a pub and even shot at a police helicopter the yobs , some said to have links with two notorious local gangs , set a landmark pub on fire as its staff cowered in living quarters upstairs to ‘ lure ’ riot police to the @entity46 , from behind barricades , they goaded the officers and attacked them with missiles before opening fire			2
@entity52 footage released by police shows a large group of men – some armed with baseball bats – gathered outside the pub , smashing windows and throwing objects into the road			2
at least four firearms were used in the attacks and 12 shots fired , with officers diving for cover as bullets flew over their heads			1
at least two shots were aimed at the helicopter , which had been brought in to monitor the disorder in @entity72 , @entity26 , during rioting last august			1
jailing the gang for a total of 124 years for what he branded a ‘ concerted attack on the police ’ , judge @entity74 said the potential consequences of a helicopter being brought down by gunfire were ‘ catastrophic ’			1
police said the gang were ‘ cowards ’ who had displayed ‘ an extraordinary degree of criminality and malice towards officers ’			2
the court was shown cctv of a large group of men fleeing from police , with two men at the rear of appearing to take aim and fire at officers and a police helicopter prosecutor @entity100 said that , after getting into formation , officers heard gunshots and were forced to take cover before being given the order to retreat for their own safety @entity108 : a @entity110 police helicopter circling over @entity26 ( file picture ) the man seen in the picture firing at the helicopter was said by police to be @entity22 , 20			1
following a six - week trial , he was convicted alongside @entity23 , 27 , @entity21 , 26 , @entity27 , 25 , and @entity117 , 20 , of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life , reckless arson and riot			1
@entity31 , 17 , was convicted of riot and possession of a firearm			1
police said some of the defendants had ties to the local @entity131 gang , which entered the national consciousness in january 2003 when its members were the intended targets of a gang - on - gang shooting in the city			1
others were tied to the @entity140 ’s group from nearby @entity141 , which was strongly allied to the @entity142			2
the defendants were part of a masked gang of 41 who were armed with firebombs as they broke in and ransacked the @entity149 pub. furniture was removed from the @entity152 pub to barricade the street outside before officers in riot vans arrived			2
the officers came under fire as they attempted to disperse the crowd			2
@entity26 @entity159 heard the police helicopter tracked the group as it moved across @entity72 and recorded individuals twice taking aim and shooting at the aircraft			1
the incident ended when firearms officers attended the scene and arrested three of the men			1
the other three were linked to the scene through forensic work , mobile phone evidence and police intelligence			2
sentencing , judge @entity173 said : ‘ the intention was to endanger life			1
although no physical injury was suffered , that was wholly a matter of luck			2
had the police helicopter been struck , the consequences could have been catastrophic			0
@entity183 alleges that the officers had been lured into the area by the pre-planned arson attack mr @entity100 told the court : ' as many as four guns were present			1
scientific evidence confirms that ' ‘ there may have been no physical injury to a police officer , but the damage to the wellbeing of the city of @entity26 caused by an armed gang prepared to act in this way was grave			1
‘ it is very difficult to conceive a case of this type more serious than this one			0
’ the judge said the disorder happened during a ‘ wave of lawlessness ’ which had ‘ swept through a number of @entity208 cities ’ last august , including elsewhere in @entity26			1
@entity21 , of @entity209 , @entity26 , was jailed for 30 years			1
the @entity211 gang member was said to have had a ‘ deep antipathy towards the police ’			0
fellow @entity214 , of @entity215 , @entity110 , and @entity22 , of @entity216 , @entity26 , were jailed for 23 years			1
@entity27 , from @entity217 , and @entity117 , from @entity218 , @entity219 , were each sentenced to 18 @entity220 , of @entity72 , was sentenced to 12 years detention			1
an order banning his identification was lifted after the sentencing			1
outside court , the detective who led the investigation said it had been a ‘ miracle ’ nobody was killed as a result of the disorder			0
detective inspector @entity232 said the gang lured police officers into an ambush by setting fire to the pub. ‘ these people showed a wanton disregard for the crew of the helicopter , the unarmed officers on the ground , members of the public and the people inside the @entity149 pub , ’ he said			0
‘ this may have happened on the same evening as the other disorder , but this was not about looting			0
‘ i have never come across a case where the offenders have shown such a blatant disregard for the lives of police officers			0
‘ the officers were in extreme danger and the shots that flew over the heads would have hit them if the gunmen had lowered their hands by a fraction			1
‘ we could easily be looking at a murder investigation			0
they are a cowardly group of people			0
‘ there is no kudos from shooting a gun at officers who are out protecting the local community			0
’ @entity271 said the attack was ‘ planned and orchestrated ’ with the pub set alight as a ‘ tactic to draw as many police as possible into the area ’			0
victims : @entity278 , pictured second left and @entity279 , right , died when they were caught in the crossfire of gangland warfare in @entity26 in 2003 the @entity149 lies on the @entity284 arterial route to the north of @entity26			1
it is a road which for two decades has acted as the unofficial boundary separating the city ’s two main gangs			0
the @entity142 , based in @entity290 to the west , and @entity292 ( bbb ) , east of the road in @entity72 , took their names from two cafes where black youths congregated in the early 1980s			0
the two groups were originally part of the same organisation , but legend has it the @entity301 fell out with the @entity142 in a row over a game of @entity304 on a computer			0
by the late 1980s , the @entity142 controlled most of the city ’s drug supply and were prominent in nightclub security			0
they were making tens of thousands of pounds a week			0
killings linked to their escalating drugs turf war began in the mid- 1990s			0
between 1999 and 2005 , gun crime in the city rose by 500 per cent			0
but it was the murders of @entity278 , 18 , and @entity315 , 17 , in january 2003 which brought @entity26 ’s gang warfare sharply into national focus			1
the innocent teenagers were gunned down at a @entity321 party in @entity72 in a drive - by attack by @entity292 members who were attempting to hit a member of the rival gang			1
while the @entity301 were considered the more ruthless , the @entity142 were the more organised			0
by then , their numbers were swelled by affiliations with newer gangs such as the @entity141 - based @entity211 – of which rioters @entity21 and @entity23 were said to be members – and the @entity332			1
their ranks also included women – once considered useful only for providing alibis and to look after their men , but by then on the streets with weapons of their own			2
it was a hit by the @entity211 just a month earlier which led to the double murder which became known as the ‘ @entity321 killings ’			0
on december 6 , 2002 , @entity292 member @entity343 , 24 , was shot dead as he sat in his car in @entity141 @entity345 by assailants linked to the @entity211			0
the prosecution in the @entity321 shootings trial claimed his brother , @entity349 , one of four men to be convicted over the murders of miss @entity278 and miss @entity279 , was ‘ blinded by hatred ’ because of the attack on his brother			0
when a teenage woman and member of the @entity131 - affiliated @entity211 was charged in connection with the death , he had the evidence he needed and began planning a revenge attack			2
the @entity72 double murder was a watershed moment in the @entity26 underworld – marking the point at which women became legitimate targets in the turf war between its two main rivals			1
@entity369 , a journalist who has written a book on the subject , said at the time : ‘ from that moment on women in gangs were seen as fair game			0
i do n’t think anyone deliberately went out looking for girls , but there was a sense that if they were in the way and got hurt , it would n’t matter the way it might have done before			0
