click here to read the full report from the season 's final race in @entity4 i was delighted to see @entity6 win the @entity7			1
without a doubt he has been the fastest man in the fastest car — and he deserved his victory			0
there is almost no limit to what @entity6 can achieve now			1
it just depends on how hungry he remains			0
my old team - mate @entity17 did not retire until he was 47 , and that was when races had to last more than three hours — twice as long as now			1
i do not think for a minute that @entity6 will compete until he is 47 — drivers drop out in their 30s these days			1
but he could race for 10 more years and win seven or eight world titles — beating @entity23 ’s record in the process — if he has the right equipment			1
draped in a @entity27 flag , @entity6 celebrates winning the world championship title victory at the @entity30 saw the @entity32 driver pick up his second world championship @entity6 is congratulated by friends and family , including popstar girlfriend @entity36 ( right ) @entity6 got off to a flying start by overtaking his @entity39 team - mate @entity38 = so how good is @entity6 ? i can not rank him alongside @entity17 — a quietly spoken gentleman and , in my opinion , the finest driver ever			1
it is hard to compare people nowadays to my era			0
i would compete in @entity47 , @entity48 , sports cars , touring cars , all sorts in any given year			0
@entity6 only races 19 times a year			1
it is not to say he could not race in other series if he wanted to ; it is just that ’s not what drivers do now			0
for example , when @entity6 wins a race he has to go to chat up the @entity65 sponsors			1
when i won a race i went to chat up a damn good - looking bit of crumpet			2
i would not have dreamed of wearing a pair of jeans , but that is what people want to wear now			0
we can not go back			0
in @entity6 ’s era , i would say @entity76 and @entity77 are two great drivers			2
i would say @entity76 might win in the same car because of his maturity and experience — and he is an immensely fast driver			2
you do n’t get four championships by sitting on the side			0
@entity6 reclaimed the drivers ' championship after fist winning the title in 2008 ( above ) @entity93 , sipping a cup of tea at a pit stop , accepts the sport has changed since his era racing legend @entity17 did not retire from the sport until he was 47 - years - old @entity93 believes @entity6 could eventually surpass @entity23 's record of seven world titles but @entity6 is right up there , and on the top of his form with the fastest car and a superb @entity39 engine			1
what has impressed me about his driving from his earlier years is how late he brakes			0
that is the mark of a top - class driver			2
his car control is second to none			0
he is pretty flawless , in fact			0
nor have i seen him do anything really untoward in the car			0
@entity23 was not always sporting , but with @entity6 i never feel he is going to push anyone off			1
he ’s a really first - class sportsman			2
i am also pleased he has won the championship with @entity117 — the greatest team i ever raced for			2
they still make terrific cars			0
they also let their drivers race without instructions			0
it is a tradition they have stuck to this season			0
@entity6 is showered in champagne by his @entity39 team - mates after his vctory @entity39 team - mate @entity38 ( right ) was gracious enough to join in the celebrations @entity132 driver @entity38 should be commended for showing such dignity in defeat my only regret is that the final race was not a real fight			1
with his car problem , @entity38 could not really compete with @entity6			1
but the outcome of the championship would have been the same anyway			0
i think @entity38 has ended up in the right place — just behind the leader			2
in that sense i feel @entity38 is to @entity6 what i was to @entity17 : a team - mate to the best driver in the world , without quite being good enough to pass him			1
@entity38 has done everything he could and he has behaved very graciously , especially in defeat			1
i just do not think @entity38 quite has @entity6 ’s raw speed			1
so , to our new @entity32 champion i say : ‘ well done , old boy			2

@entity6 was crowned @entity7 after winning @entity30
@entity32 driver could now go on to better @entity23 's record
@entity39 team - mate @entity38 commended for his dignity in defeat
