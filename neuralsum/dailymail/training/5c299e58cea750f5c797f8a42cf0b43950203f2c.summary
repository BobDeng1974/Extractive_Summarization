by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 20 february 2013 @entity3 diplomats considered the possibility of allowing @entity6 a naval base on the @entity7 shortly before the 1982 invasion , newly declassified documents reveal			1
they show how @entity9 , of the @entity10 in @entity11 , contacted his @entity13 counterpart @entity12 to discuss tensions with @entity6 before filing a restricted memorandum on march 5 1982			2
@entity13 and @entity6 had long been in dispute over the possession of @entity19 , @entity19 and @entity19 islands in the @entity20 at the southern tip of @entity22 and had come to the brink of war in 1978			0
enter the @entity6 : @entity26 diplomats considered discussing an @entity6 permission to operate a naval base from the @entity7 just two weeks before the 1982 war ( pictured is @entity30 ) according to the documents , @entity12 told @entity32 that @entity6 ’s sovereignty disputes with @entity13 and the @entity26 both stemmed from the country ’s desire to have a naval base further south			1
‘ the @entity12 thesis is based essentially on the @entity41 ’s need of a strategic port further south than its current and most secure port , @entity44 , ( south of the province of @entity11 ) , ’ one document states			0
‘ the obvious option @entity46 was not satisfactory from a security point of view because it is under constant @entity13 surveillance			0
‘ therefore the @entity6 are , according to @entity12 , desperate to have some other secure port further south , a goal that could be satisfied by having access to the islands south of @entity20 or the @entity7			2
in this context , he believes the sovereignty disputes are linked			0
’ on the verge : a mere two weeks after the @entity26 ambassador to @entity6 corresponded with his @entity13 counterpart regarding the naval base , war broke out new base : in 1982 , @entity6 wanted a naval base further south and @entity26 ambassador @entity9 thought it an idea to bring a possible base on the @entity7 to the table on march 15 the report , headed ‘ a @entity68 with @entity13 ? ’ , was received and distributed to @entity69 , manager of the @entity22 section of the @entity3 , and other senior officials			1
handwritten notes were then added to the documents , suggesting the @entity26 were open to the idea of negotiating an agreement for an @entity6 naval base on the @entity7 just two weeks before the war began			1
one scribbled note states : ‘ i think we are agreed that the @entity6 interest in @entity84 security is part of her wish to gain sovereignty over the islands			2
but it ’s only a small part			0
after all , if all they wanted was a naval base we could easily accommodate them			1
’ another in different handwriting comments : ‘ could we easily accommodate the @entity6 on a naval base ? because this is the sort of idea which we should have in mind if negotiations do resume			1
’ @entity6 long disputed rulings that the islands in the @entity20 were @entity13 but finally recognised them as such in 1984 following papal mediation .			0

declassified report reveal @entity26 considered @entity6 base on @entity7
