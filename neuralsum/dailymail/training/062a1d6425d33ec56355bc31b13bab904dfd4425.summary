by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:20 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 18:20 est , 15 february 2013 across the @entity5 , the @entity4 horse meat scandal has swept the continent			1
millions of products were pulled from store shelves in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 after the scandal broke			1
on friday , the @entity18 agreed to begin random dna checks on meat products , while @entity9 authorities announced traces of horse had been found in school meals , restaurant dishes and hospital food , as well as supermarket products			1
but a similar scandal is unlikely to happen in @entity29 , as the country no longer slaughters the animals or imports horse meat			1
also , according to @entity37 , none of the companies or countries implicated in the labeling controversy actually export beef to the @entity29 a dump truck is filled up with blocks of meat at @entity11 meat processor @entity44 's factory			1
@entity11 authorities blame @entity44 for the fraud that led to the horse meat scandal @entity49 , director of the @entity50 at @entity51 , told @entity37 : ' it 's difficult to say that it could never happen here , but it 's a lot less likely			1
' ' the bottom line is that no horse meat is legally being slaughtered for commerce right now in the @entity29 , ' @entity49 added			1
slaughtering or selling horses for meat was made illegal throughout the @entity29 in 2006			2
though the @entity63 ban was lifted in 2011 , no states have yet resumed the practice			0
federal laws ensure that that a @entity67 inspector be present at all slaughterhouses to check on the safety , hygiene and labeling of carcasses			0
@entity49 says that even in states that had slaughtered horses before the ban , no money has been put forward to restart inspections			0
@entity77 , a food safety expert at the @entity79 in @entity80 told @entity37 that : ' unless you have a @entity67 inspector in a meat processing plant , you ca n't sell that meat legally , ' he said			0
but despite the @entity67 checks @entity77 admits that horsemeat could still enter the food supply fraudulently			0
' that does n't mean someone is not doing it illegally , ' he added			0
horse meat is a common sight in @entity11 , like at this @entity94 butchers			1
but it is rarely eaten in the @entity29 the @entity4 crisis started in mid-january , when @entity10 's food safety watchdog announced that it had discovered traces of horse dna in burger products sold by major @entity9 and @entity102 supermarkets			1
the mislabeled products came from @entity102 processor @entity104 , which withdrew 10 million burgers from store shelves			1
@entity102 officials first blamed an imported powdered beef - protein additive used to pad out cheap burgers , then frozen blocks of slaughterhouse leftovers imported from @entity113 - an indication of the complexity of the food - supply chain that was about to be revealed to an alarmed @entity4 public			0
traces of horse meat have turned up across @entity4 in frozen supermarket meals such as burgers and lasagna , as well as in in fresh beef pasta sauce , on restaurant menus , in school lunches and in hospital meals			2
on friday , several @entity9 supermarket chains - including @entity128 and @entity129 - said their tests had been negative so far			0
but @entity9 's @entity131 said 29 of 2,501 products tested contained at least 1 percent horse dna			1
all were burgers , lasagna and meat sauces sold by supermarkets and catering firms			0

' officials also said horse meat was present in cottage pies delivered to 47 schools in @entity173 county , northern @entity174 , and in hospital meals in @entity10			1
tests are continuing , and officials say this is far from over			0
' the more people have looked for horse meat , the more products have been found containing it , ' said @entity183 , a senior @entity9 food inspector			1
' i do n't think we have got to the bottom of it yet			0
' @entity4 officials say the scandal is the result of fraud , and possibly an international criminal conspiracy to pass off cheap horse meat as more expensive beef			1
the @entity11 government says the chain of fraudulent meat sales reaches across 28 firms in 13 countries scandal : meat from @entity44 found its way into @entity204 beef lasagne in @entity9 at least some of the horse meat originated at abattoirs in @entity150 , and was sent through a @entity208 - registered trader to a warehouse in the @entity210			1
a @entity11 meat wholesaler , @entity44 , bought the meat from the trader , then resold it to the @entity11 frozen food processor @entity214			2
the resulting food was marketed in @entity9 and other countries under the @entity15 - based @entity204 label as lasagna and other products containing ground beef			1
@entity11 authorities blame @entity44 for the fraud , but it strongly denies wrongdoing			0

three men have been arrested			0
horse meat itself is not harmful , and is eaten in several @entity4 countries , including @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity275			1
in @entity174 - speaking countries including @entity9 and @entity10 eating horses is widely considered taboo			2
@entity9 officials have said that horses slaughtered in @entity9 after being treated with the equine painkiller phenylbutazone , or bute , may have made their way into the human food chain in @entity11			2
@entity285 is banned for human use because in rare cases it causes severe side effects , but veterinary experts say there is little risk from consuming small amounts in horse meat			2

critics say the food supply chain is too complicated and lightly policed to be truly secure			0
but the @entity18 's health commissioner , @entity325 , said @entity11 authorities ' identification and suspension of @entity44 demonstrated ' that traceability of food in the @entity18 works			2
' ' consumers must be assured that everything will be done at the @entity18 level to restore , as soon as possible , their confidence in the products on our markets , ' @entity325 said			2
