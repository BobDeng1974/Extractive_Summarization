who remembers @entity2 ' failed attempt to pass the ball to @entity4 in their infamous penalty cock - up ? well , @entity8 outfit @entity7 have shown the @entity10 legends how it should be done			1
the @entity7 beat @entity11 thanks to the successful spot - kick routine which was scored by @entity14 after usual penalty taker @entity15 flicked the ball to him from the spot - a move which was unsuccessfully attempted by @entity2 and @entity4			1
@entity2 tried to pass the ball to @entity4 during a match between @entity10 and @entity22 in 2005 the two @entity23 were not on the same page as @entity2 mishit his pass to his fellow countryman @entity2 and @entity4 's blushes were spared as @entity10 managed to win the @entity29 encounter the @entity23 pair 's attempt is one of the biggest blunders in the @entity29 as @entity2 mishit his pass to @entity4 and conceded a free - kick in the process			2
the duo avoided a public dressing down from manager @entity38 as @entity10 managed to hold on to their 1 - 0 lead against @entity22 back in october 2005			0
@entity38 said after the match that @entity2 , who had already scored a penalty to notch @entity10 's 500th @entity29 goal at @entity43 , ' made a big mistake and a wrong decision ' but was not ' lacking seriousness or respect '			0
the @entity48 , fortunately for them , got it right			0

@entity7 penalty taker @entity15 ran up to take the spot - kick but decided to pass the ball @entity15 fooled @entity11 goalkeeper @entity57 by passing the ball to club team - mate @entity14			1

@entity7 penalty taker @entity15 decided to pass the ball from spot
@entity14 managed to score from @entity15 's pass *unlike* @entity10 's failed effort
@entity4 and @entity2 ' attempt went *horribly* wrong in @entity10 's encounter against @entity22 in 2005
