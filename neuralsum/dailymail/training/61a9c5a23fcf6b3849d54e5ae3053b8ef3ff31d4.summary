@entity8 , 19 , spent a year saving up to buy a limited edition of the sought - after console for his son @entity13 's fourth @entity12			1
but the student was duped last week by an advert which said ' @entity17 edition , @entity16 ' - referring only to a sheet of @entity20 paper			1
the auction site seller even wrote ' thank you for your purchase ' on the back			1
conned : @entity8 , 19 , paid £ 450 for an @entity5 console on @entity6 - but got a photo of one instead ' i told my brother and he was crying with laughter , ' he said			1
' so were all of my mates			0
it is quite embarrassing ' consolation prize : the misleading advert which has since been removed by the auction site @entity6 the student , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' i 'm absolutely gutted			1
' i had saved up for months , just cutting back on things and putting money in a pot , £ 20 here and £ 10 there			1
' it came in a brown envelope			0
when the postman gave it to me i kept asking him if he was sure this package was for me and he kept saying it was			0
' as soon as i knew it was for me i realised it was a con			0
i pulled out a crumbled piece of @entity20 paper with a pretty bad picture of an @entity5 probably taken from @entity55			0

' the student from @entity38 , who was buying the console for his four - year - old son @entity13 , said : ' i was shocked but then i thought , i only have myself to blame because it does say the word " photo " on the ad ' misleading : the description for the @entity5 photo which @entity8 , 19 , bought last week huge success : the @entity5 console has already sold out until the new year in online shops including @entity71 the father - of - one has since been refunded by @entity6 but will be unlikely to pick up another console - as it has almost completely sold out in the @entity75 just two weeks after its release			1
normally selling for £ 430 , the @entity5 is sold out until the new year yesterday on major online retailers , including @entity71 , along with the @entity78			2
@entity79 , trading standards officer at @entity81 , said there were several ways for buyers to protect themselves			0
she added : ' we would encourage all @entity6 buyers to pay for their goods using @entity88 to give them extra protection			0
' @entity88 states that if the item does n't match the seller 's description or gets lost in the post then it will give the buyer their money back			2
' our main tips for buying online generally this @entity12 is make sure you 're getting a good deal , know who you 're dealing with and protect your personal and financial information			2
' despite his experience , mr @entity8 said friends and even his mother have done little to console him			1
' i told my brother and he was crying with laughter , ' he said			0
' so were all of my mates			0
' even my mum said i was a bit stupid considering it said it was a photo on the listing			2
' this has definitely turned me off @entity6 and i do n't think i will be using it again because of this			0
' it has potentially ruined @entity12			2
' he added : ' i e-mailed the seller and he told me it was a console - so he did lie to me			1
' an @entity6 spokesman said : ' we do n't allow listings which mislead , and will take action against this seller			0
' customers can shop with confidence on @entity6 as we guarantee you will get your item or your money back			0
' mr @entity8 is covered by the @entity6 money - back guarantee and we will be contacting him to put things right			1
