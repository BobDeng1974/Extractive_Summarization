by @entity0 it could not have been a more perfect engagement gift from a proud groom to his blue - blooded , dog - loving wife - to - be			1
when writer @entity6 presented society milliner @entity7 with an impossibly cute £ 800 pug , she was just as thrilled as he knew she would be			1
that , however , was when things began to go horribly wrong			2
@entity7 with pug @entity12 , who was bought in a panic as a replacement for a lost pug cash , a friend of actress @entity18 , was left panic - stricken when he lost the pug – a rare 14 - week - old bitch called @entity21 – in a storm a fortnight before the wedding			1
@entity7 , 29 , whose father is the 7th @entity25 of a pug - obsessed clan that dates back to the 12th century , was on her hen night in @entity30 , leaving her fiance to look after @entity21 and their four - year - old labrador , @entity34			1
but while @entity6 worked upstairs at the couple ’s moated @entity36 manor – @entity38 in @entity39 – the kitchen door , warped by the february floods , blew off , and the two dogs fled			2
‘ i panicked because @entity7 was due home about four hours later , ’ admits @entity6 , the son of @entity43 mp @entity6			1
after broadcasting an sos over the airwaves of @entity47 , he also enlisted the help of his neighbour , @entity49 , former wife of pop star @entity50			2
her two lurchers hunted in vain for the runaways			2
‘ the labrador eventually came home with her tail between her legs , ’ says @entity6			1
@entity21 , the first little pug , who @entity6 tried to replace with new pug @entity12 ‘ but we never saw @entity21 again			1
i all but drained the moat but to no avail			2
a fox or a hawk must have got her			2
in the middle of it all , @entity7 rang me to say , “ i ’ll be back by 7pm at the latest			2
i ca n’t wait to see my pug			1
” ’ @entity6 , 47 , has previously been married to jewellery heiress @entity69 and @entity71 ’s ex-lover @entity70 – and he feared that losing @entity21 could cost him a third wife			0
so he did what any serial groom would do : he lied			0
in an episode that could have been plucked from the @entity78 comedy @entity75 or the @entity79 ’ hit @entity80 , @entity6 quickly tracked down a lookalike pug for £ 1,000 on the internet and set off in his jeep on a 75 - minute drive to a housing estate in @entity86 , @entity87			1
‘ i was so terrified i even rang up a minicab company to give me an escort , ’ he says			0
‘ we ended up at 4pm in this rough - looking cul - de - sac which was guarded by a big beefy gent covered in tattoos			1
and there was me – £ 1,000 in fifties stuffed into the pockets of my @entity97			1
@entity38 and @entity98 ( and surrounding fields ) , the home of @entity6 and his wife , pug mad @entity7 ‘ i thought , “ this is it , only an idiot would fall for this scam			1
i ’m not going to make it to the altar – they ’re going to find me in the back garden of some nasty terrace , bonked on the head			0
” ’ @entity6 need not have worried			0
fifteen minutes later , he was the proud owner of @entity12 , a six - week - old @entity112 - registered pug			1
‘ i raced home and got there with minutes to spare			0
when @entity7 arrived , the first thing she said was , “ i want to give my pug a big hug			1
” silently , i handed her over , fearing the worst but hoping for the best			0
@entity7 and @entity6 on their wedding day ‘ i tried to brazen it out but @entity7 was n’t having it			0
she said straight away , “ she ’s lost a lot of weight , have you not been feeding her ? why has she got a white chest ? and why is she so much more black ? is this really my pug ? have you killed my pug ? ” ' for @entity7 , pugs come first			1
pugs , hats and then – hopefully – me			0
i had to come clean			0
‘ she was very upset but , thankfully , she and @entity12 fell totally in love			0
@entity7 did realise that i was at least , two weeks before the wedding , trying to make her happy			0
‘ and i think she was secretly impressed that i had managed to track down a replacement so quickly – black pug bitches are notoriously rare			1
the first one took us four months to find			0
’ @entity6 is , however , back on probation after another accident almost put paid to the second dog			0
‘ @entity12 is 14 weeks old now – the same age as @entity21 when she disappeared – and she ’s a very mischievous , feisty dog			0
i was walking her along @entity145 in @entity146 the other day when she darted off into traffic			0
' i had to rugby - tackle her			1
one lost pug was bad enough – i could n’t weather a second			1
’ @entity6 proposed to @entity7 at the church set in the grounds of his home last september			0
‘ it was all very romantic , ’ he says			0
‘ her favourite flowers are thistles so i lined the font with them and hid the ring			0
then we rang the bells			0
’ at their wedding last month , @entity162 ’s son @entity161 , 12 , acted as pageboy			2
‘ i did think about telling the pug story in my groom ’s speech , ’ says @entity6			2
‘ but then i looked up and saw all @entity7 ’s family – all those pug - loving faces – and i bottled it			1

@entity173 struck as @entity175 *'s* son lost £ 800 prize pug
*risked* life and limb in @entity75 - style hunt for a replacement
eventually tracked down a look alike down and tries to pass it off as *original*
