victim @entity0 , who tracked down the thief who stole his power tools using @entity3 and then confronted him a handyman who had his power tools stolen found the items for sale on @entity3 - and then tracked down the thief himself after police told him they were n't going to investigate			1
@entity0 feared he would have to fork out £ 4,000 to replace his collection of electric saws , screwdrivers , drills and other tools after they were taken from his @entity16 van in @entity17 , @entity18			1
in the hope they might turn up online , mr @entity0 began trawling through the online auction site two days after the theft as police told him they were n't going to do anything about it			1
the former special constable then found his tools on sale , and decided to pose as a prospective buyer			1
he then won the auction with his bid and told police where he would be meeting the man for the stolen goods , and suggested they be there to arrest the thief			1
and after agreeing that he would cough when it was time to pounce , officers then swooped on @entity37 , 35 , and arrested him on his doorstep			1
when they went inside his house , they found most of mr @entity0 's tools			1
today @entity37 , of @entity41 in @entity18 , was warned he faced jail after admitting handling stolen goods - including a multi-tool , planers , saws , jigsaws , drills and nailers - at @entity50			1
mr @entity0 explained : ' that morning i reported it to the police but they were n't doing anything about it and were just giving me a crime reference number - although an officer did come out to see me			1
' i just gave up because they get so much of this sort of thing and i understand it 's hard for them to chase up			0
i knew i 'd be given a crime reference number so because of that i wanted to look for the tools myself			2
i 've had my tools stolen before and had to buy them again			1
i was going mad , this was my livelihood and a lot of people were let down because of it			0
' i have 10 men under me and we were having to hire tools in for three or four days			1
the lads could n't work that day , it had a big effect for three or four days			1
it was an absolute nightmare			0
' two days later , mr @entity0 began his own investigation and logged on to @entity3 suspecting the tools may have been put up for auction			1
to his surprise he then found the tools were being sold by a user with the @entity84			1
the 26 - year - old said he recognised the tools straight away as he had marked some of them with his initials			2
he said : ' i thought the tools would probably be sold on the internet so i had a look			2
i could n't believe he had put them on so soon			2
i got robbed on a tuesday and by the thursday they were on @entity3			1
i kept a watch on them on the site and two days later he put some more on			1
' at first i thought that they could n't be mine but they had obvious modifications done to them and i was zooming in on the pictures and the serial numbers			2
' i thought " they are definitely mine " and i thought " i 've got to win them " and put a decent bid in			2
i was winning them and beating people			0
i did it on my girlfriend 's account so he would n't know it was me			2
it was quite nerve wracking			0
' mr @entity0 successfully won the auction and contacted the seller to get his address , telling him he could come and collect them			1
he added : ' i told police and they said they 'd have to get a warrant and that would take two days			2
' i thought , " i 'm winning these back			0
" i rang the inspector and said that i knew they were mine straight away			0
he was really good and said he 'd meet me round the corner of the address			0
' on the day of the pick - up i had my mate with me because he wanted to come and i had all the barcodes of the tools written on my hand and my friend had to text the inspector saying " yes come round "			0
we parked at the end of the drive so he could n't shoot off			0
it was like something off the tv			0
@entity37 , who admitted handling stolen goods and was warned that he could face jail ' this guy came out of the house and he had my tools			1
he kept coming to the door with everything else that had been robbed			0
i identified all the tools			0
i said to my mate that if i start coughing that means they are my tools			0
' as soon as he came out i started coughing			0
the police came flying around the corner in a van and a car and started running up the drive			0
he had his back to them so he did n't know what was going on and they pinned him			2
just before , i had said " they are my tools "			0
' he did n't know what to do , he said , " let me say sorry to my wife "			0
his wife and kids were there , i felt awkward because she was crying			0
' when i found the tools the @entity50 police were brilliant			1
after the inspector was saying " good work "			0
i always wanted to be in the police but when i did it i did n't like it - it was too much paperwork			2
' at @entity175 , prosecuting , said mr @entity0 contacted police , who were then on standby when he went to collect the tools			1
she added : ' when the defendant opened the door and brought the items , he identified them as clearly having been stolen from his van			2
' @entity37 's address was searched and officers returned further tools to mr @entity0			1
six items which had been stolen were not recovered and that included a £ 25 wallet and £ 275 cash.the defendant 's van was searched and four snap bags cannabis were found			1
in interview @entity37 said he got the tools from somebody he knew - but refused to name - and claimed he was gullible			1
he said he would have got the money either through @entity199 or cash			0
he had 14 offences on his record			0
@entity37 , who was not legally represented , told the court : ' we had just had a baby and i was skint			2
' he described himself a a ' car booter ' said someone he had met at a sale asked him if he wanted to sell some stuff on @entity3 for them and he would get 20 per cent			1
he added : ' he told me he had bought them at a car boot			0
to be honest , i did n't ask any questions			0
