there are a lot of snobs in football who look down their noses at players like @entity7			1
against @entity10 , the @entity9 man was magnificent			1
i spoke to @entity12 on @entity14 ’s @entity13 after the game and he was waxing lyrical about the job @entity7 does for the team			1
with his black boots on and his fighting style , he ’s an old - school player			2
he scraps for every ball but his reputation precedes him			0
his disciplinary record is poor , but that comes from playing on the edge			0
we are not blessed with many top defensive midfielders in this country but @entity7 is more than holding his own against some of @entity40 ’s best this season			1
our table below shows how defensively he is matching the likes of @entity43 and @entity44			1
i ’m not saying he is at the same level as them , but he should not be dismissed out of hand			0
against @entity10 he showed he can perform against the very best			1
some people will never be convinced , but if he can curb that aggression then maybe even bigger things lie ahead			0
@entity7 's defensive statistics from midfield are up there with the best of the @entity56 leagues ( * before sunday night 's matches in @entity40 ) @entity7 is matching the likes of @entity43 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) with defensive stats @entity9 boss @entity12 was full of praise for his ' exceptional ' midfielder after the game @entity7 in action for @entity64 in 2009 , but the midfielder has never played for the senior side @entity69 's @entity68 cause @entity7 is not the only @entity70 who might feel overlooked by his country			1
@entity72 is @entity69 ’s mr consistent			1
you would do well to find a player in the @entity76 who gives more for his team than @entity72 , but he ’s a quality player , too			1
he ’s another who does not jump out as an obvious talent but he does an excellent job in a team that is going places this season			2
he will have seen @entity84 head off for @entity64 duty and @entity86 and @entity87 have been called up recently			0
@entity72 might rightly be wondering when it will be his turn			1
@entity72 is another midfielder who is pushing @entity90 for an @entity64 call - up @entity92 gunning for @entity10 @entity94 's move to @entity95 raised a few eyebrows , but it ’s been a move that has benefited both parties			1
aside from his equaliser against his old club , the deal has not really hampered @entity10 and it has certainly helped @entity95			1
who would n’t want the greatest goalscoring midfielder in @entity76 history in their squad ? @entity94 gives his approval to the @entity95 fans after the 3 - 0 win over @entity110 @entity94 's shot flew past @entity112 and @entity113 before hitting the back of the net after scoring at @entity110 he now has 174 @entity76 goals — one behind @entity117			1
that is an incredible record			0
no doubt he ’s looking forward to his @entity121 adventure but right now he will be focused on one thing : hunting down @entity10			1
he ’ll say all the right things in public but make no mistake , @entity92 is a winner			2
he ’d love nothing more than to help @entity95 beat @entity10 to the title			1
@entity94 would love nothing more than to help @entity95 beat @entity10 to the title @entity94 , pictured with @entity131 , appears to be happy at @entity95 after summer move @entity133 's starting to @entity134 some flak @entity137 fans unfurled a banner at @entity139 saying @entity141 ’s time is up			1
they should be careful what they wish for			0
people point to @entity134 as @entity141 ’s heir , but they need to be pointed towards the @entity147 table			0
@entity134 ’s @entity149 team lost again on sunday and are bottom , 22 points behind leaders @entity153			1
@entity134 says he wants to manage in @entity70 one day			0
at the minute he should just concentrate on keeping his job in @entity155			0
@entity137 supporters held up a banner at the @entity139 game demanding @entity141 's exit people point to @entity134 as @entity141 ’s heir , but they need to be pointed towards the @entity147 table @entity134 says he wants to manage in @entity70 one day but at the moment should concentrate on @entity149 @entity162 starting to sharpen up this season i have been a bit disappointed by @entity162 , but i ’m a big fan of the little man			1
he has not played too often in 2014 - 15 but whenever he has , he has n’t taken his chances			0
he ’s been shunted around and has had to play second fiddle to the sensational @entity170			0
at @entity139 his pass for @entity173 ’s goal was sublime and it looked like he was getting back to his best			0
@entity162 ( left ) proved the main man for @entity137 on saturday and was instrumental in the victory @entity177 goes the extra mile 51 - tackles made by @entity177 so far this season			1
only @entity180 ( 57 ) has made more @entity177 is @entity182 ’s @entity181			2
they have some good players but @entity177 is the driving force in that side			0
last season he won 102 tackles — more than any other midfielder			1
now he is adding goals to his repertoire			0
last week he scored a spectacular free - kick against @entity192 and all we spoke about was how badly @entity192 defended			0
if that were @entity170 or @entity195 we would be going crazy over that goal			0
he is a real captain , always leading the way , and another fine example of an unsung midfield hero			0
@entity177 ( centre ) celebrates scoring a penalty alongside his team - mates on saturday spurred on i ’ve been critical of @entity204 in the past , but they were good against @entity206			2
they have made some poor signings but @entity209 is a shining light for them			2
@entity209 wheels away as he finds the net in the 2 - 1 win over @entity206 on sunday 384 - despite their undoubted individual brilliance , @entity215 and @entity195 have never quite clicked as a strike partnership			2
@entity219 teed up @entity195 for @entity221 ’s second against @entity222 but it was the first time the two had combined for a league goal in 384 days — the last one came against @entity137 in a 1 - 0 win on november 10 , 2013			2
504 - @entity229 's goal against @entity230 ended @entity232 ’s 504 - minute wait for a goal			2
@entity235 ’s side had not scored since a 2 - 2 draw against @entity237 on october 4			0
627 - @entity238 finally ended his @entity76 goal drought after 627 minutes			0
@entity238 last scored in march against @entity240			0
700th - saturday 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity242 came in @entity244 ’s 700th game as a manager			1
he has been in charge at @entity222 , @entity9 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity182 , @entity249 and @entity250			1
54 mins - it took @entity139 54 minutes to have an attempt at goal against @entity137 , the longest wait for any team this season			2
18 - @entity257 is still the main man in 2014			0
after his goal against @entity182 , the @entity259 striker has 18 @entity76 goals this calendar year , more than any other player			0
82 - they have not been quite as free - scoring as they were last season , but @entity95 are still a force to be reckoned with up front			2
@entity269 ’s side have had 82 shots on target this season , more than any other team .			2

@entity9 's @entity7 has been in superb form this season
on saturday against @entity10 he thwarted the league leaders *superbly*
he 's made more *recoveries* , *clearances* and *blocks* than @entity281 , @entity58 , @entity43 and @entity44 before sunday
@entity72 is another midfielder who may feel overlooked by his country
@entity94 is a winner , and will want to pip @entity10 to the title
