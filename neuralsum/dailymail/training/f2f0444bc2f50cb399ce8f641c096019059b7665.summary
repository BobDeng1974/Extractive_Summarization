by @entity0 and @entity1 an @entity3 wildcat that was at the centre of a police search after it escaped whilst its owners were on holiday was caught after it was corned by a tiny house cat in the back of a neighbours garden , say police			1
the @entity3 wildcat was spotted by a neighbour in their garden late last night , close to where the cat had first gone missing near where its owners lived			1
a neighbour saw their own tiny house cat challenge the big @entity3 cat which had been described as ' dangerous ' , but both were equally scared of one another			1
they told police that they had watched several local reports in the media and realised that the missing @entity3 wildcat was in their garden prowling around			1
they then said how they saw their own pet cat challenge the big cat but said both looked quite scared of each other			1
a police spokesperson for @entity57 police told @entity58 : ‘ the owner of the cat turned up to get the cat from the neighbour ’s house and brought a blanket to subdue him			1
‘ the neighbours called the police and they all arrived at the house at 8.50pm last night			1
‘ when the wildcat was captured , it was nervous and worried as it had not been out of the house before			2
‘ but it calmed down when the owner threw a blanket over it			0
@entity75 confirm that the owner will not face any charges , but will be given advice on how to look after animals properly so that it does not happen again			0
@entity81 were called after the cat was found			1
the large @entity3 wild cat had been seen creeping menacingly past the undergrowth showing just why it is nicknamed the ‘ savannah stalker ’			1
but it was no match for a smaller pet and @entity89 which launched a widespread search - including a police helicopter - for the ' dangerous ' cat in @entity30 after it went missing			1
in a tweet by @entity31 today , it was confirmed that the cat had been found			2
the tweet read : ' great news ! ! ! the missing serval from @entity34 has been reunited with their owner - thank you to all who helped with the search			2
the message was then re-tweeted by @entity89 who had lead the search			0
yesterday , before its capture a picture emerged of the cat near a neat lawn , climbing frame and slide which were all giveaways that this particular beast – a potentially dangerous serval – is a long way from its natural home			0
for this display of stealth was taking place yesterday not in the wilds of @entity3 but in the tame gardens of north @entity30 , well within the stockbroker belt			2
the exact location of the suburban safari was @entity34 where shocked householder @entity123 captured the serval on camera as it padded past his shrubbery			2
police warned that the wild cat should not be approached			1
a police helicopter and the @entity130 joined the hunt and the public were asked to call 999 if they spotted the animal			1
it is owned by a local couple who had left it in the care of a cat - sitter while on holiday			1
but it gave its guardian the slip and was last night on the loose , until it was caught at 8.50pm			0
the serval : a cat of spare parts police said it had been reported missing at around 9am yesterday having escaped from an address in @entity34			1
fortunately it is well domesticated			0
a police spokesman said : ‘ at around 9am today we received a report that a serval cat was on the loose			0
‘ the pet cat had escaped from an address in @entity157 , @entity34			2
‘ the animal is registered as a dangerous cat although it is not believed to be aggressive			0
’ the serval , similar in appearance to a small leopard , stands about 18 inches tall and is 2ft long			0
its owners are believed to be due back from holiday today			0
one of their neighbours , @entity168 , said : ‘ i have been keeping an eye out for it in my garden and have seen the helicopter going overhead but i have n’t seen the cat			2
’ the police helicopter crew joked on @entity175 : ‘ on safari with @ @entity178 looking for escaped serval			0
’ @entity181 owners in the @entity182 must have a licence to keep them as pets - which the police confirmed that the owners had for the cat			1
the animals are also cross-bred with domestic cats to produce @entity191 cats , which can sell for more than £ 600 each as kittens			0
video courtesy of @entity194 the serval is known as the ' cat of spare parts ' thanks to ears and legs which are very big for its body size , its small head , long neck and short tail			0
large ears let it hear the rodents it hunts as they tunnel underground			0
long legs allow it to leap vertically up to ten feet in the air to catch birds			0
their beautifully patterned hair makes them attractive to poachers .			0
