@entity5 , 21 , was also told to pay a £ 150 ' security fee ' after he was seen testing speakers on sale in a branch of the supermarket - even though he put the equipment back where he found it			1
the giant firm sent him an aggressive letter warning that staff would call the police if they ever catch him trying to enter @entity2 's			1
banned : @entity5 , 21 , was told he could not return to @entity2 's after he opened some speakers there mr @entity5 , who has learning difficulties and is unemployed , went into the @entity2 's branch in @entity20 and opened two boxes containing £ 25 speakers			1
he then tested the gadgets to see if they worked with his mobile phone , and put them back on display - but was immediately apprehended by security			0
@entity29 took him into the manager 's office and forced him to empty his bag , but he was cleared of shoplifting			1
mr @entity5 later received a pair of letters saying that he was banned from all 1,200 @entity2 's stores across the country , and had to pay £ 150 in compensation			1
however , the company has now backed down and agreed to revoke the ban , as well as waiving the £ 150 fine			2
he said : ' the first set of speakers did n't work and the second were n't very good so i put everything back in the boxes			2
' i was walking out of the shop when the security guard grabbed me and took me into the manager 's office			1

' i think staff initially thought he was a shoplifter but after he proved he had nothing in his bag they should have just let him go			0
