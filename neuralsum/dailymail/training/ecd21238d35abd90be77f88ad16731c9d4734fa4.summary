so far , a 40 - nation coalition led by the @entity16 and including @entity5 as well as @entity49 nations have carried out air strikes while ruling out combat troops			2
mr @entity3 , who appeared to be delivering the message under duress , added that the beheading videos were a ‘ win - win ’ for the militant group			1
however , it appears the film was shot before the murder of @entity60			0
delivering scripted lines , mr @entity3 said the decapitation of ‘ three previous cellmates ’ by @entity1 fanatics had shocked the public			1
but taxi driver mr @entity60 was the fourth @entity67 hostage to be executed , after @entity16 journalists @entity69 and @entity71 and @entity5 aid worker @entity68			2

it is slickly put together , in a propaganda magazine designed to inflame the feelings of @entity28 followers			0
describing mr @entity3 as ' nobody going nowhere ' , the article says he is sleeping on a matress on the floor of a ' clean and comfortable ' room , which ' for a man in my position , it is enough '			1
it states : ' four of my cellmates have already been executed by the @entity1 in the most visceral way possible after the @entity5 and @entity16 governments apparently made a joint decision not to discuss terms for our release with our captors			2
familiar : the article includes a photograph of mr @entity3 appearing to wear the now - familiar orange outfit worn by him in previous videos and by other is hostages mr @entity3 said : ‘ if these executions force public outcry or a policy change , that is a huge victory			1
and if they only goad our governments into dropping more bombs and spending millions more dollars , making our countries weaker in the process , that is a victory too			0
’ magazine : the article appeared in propaganda magazine dabiq mr @entity3 – kidnapped two years ago – said @entity28 would ‘ passionately and violently ’ outlast any action ordered by @entity133 : ‘ anyone hoping for a nice neat surgical operation without getting their hands dirty is in for a horrible surprise once it gets under way			1
’ he added : ‘ one month ago @entity133 pressed the button on air strikes			0
now we have to wonder how long his policy of no boots on the ground has left to live			0
as for @entity28 , they eagerly await to see those boots			0
’ mr @entity3 said on the video – introduced with the title @entity150 – that it was conceivable foreign jihadis could return to their home countries to carry out attacks			1
he also says @entity155 chose not to enter negotiations with @entity1 that might have got the hostages out , and is now using the beheadings as an excuse to ‘ beat the drums ’ for military action against @entity162			0
he added : ‘ i deeply resent it , prime minister			0
’ in the article published online in @entity27 magazine , mr @entity3 calls on the government to negotiate his release			1

he said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them			0
speaking about watching the original footage of his son , he said : ‘ for the first time in almost two years , we saw @entity3 when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the @entity1 and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die			0
‘ as a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing @entity3 and knowing that he is alive			0
this was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness			0
’ addressing his son ’s captors , he said : ‘ to those holding @entity3 : please know that he is a good man , he sought only to help the @entity11 people and i ask you from all that is sacred , to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him			2
’ smoke rises after a strike on the @entity11 town of @entity217 , known as @entity218 by the @entity219 , as seen from the @entity221 - @entity11 border			2
@entity28 are now poised to take the town , despite desperate fighting from @entity219 resistance flying high : the black flag of @entity226 flies over the @entity219 @entity11 town of @entity218			2
