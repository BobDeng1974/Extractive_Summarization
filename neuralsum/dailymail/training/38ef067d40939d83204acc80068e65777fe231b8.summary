@entity1 manager @entity0 has held up @entity3 skipper @entity2 as a role model for the nation ’s future professionals			1
the 34 - year - old @entity8 striker will be back on the other side of the @entity10 preparing for sunday ’s @entity12 play - offs showdown with the @entity13 when his international team - mates run out to face the @entity15 in a friendly at the @entity17 on tuesday evening			2
however , @entity0 admits he repeatedly uses @entity2 , who has scored 65 international goals in 138 senior appearances for @entity3 , as an example of what it takes to succeed as a player at the highest level			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 has praised @entity3 and @entity8 striker @entity2 @entity2 was brought off the bench with 12 minutes remaining of @entity3 's 1 - 0 loss to @entity27 he said : ' i often say that in the @entity1 , @entity2 is a role model for all the @entity15 players growing up in this beautiful game			1
' that ’s what he has done since he came overseas , he shows to the young players what it takes to become a professional , how much dedication you need , how much commitment you need			2
' @entity2 is the same @entity2 in training as in the game , so he is huge for @entity12 because these are the type of players that you need to have in your environment to make the league grow and to make younger players understand what the real big players are doing			1
@entity51 midfielder @entity50 ( left ) chases down @entity53 star @entity52 at @entity54 ' at the same time , he continues to play for @entity3 at the highest level , scoring goals , going back and forth , so i definitely use him a lot as an example how to do it			1
' he will leave a huge mark , hopefully a long time down the road , when he leaves the game , with what he has done for @entity12 over the years			0
' @entity0 ’s team , who were only denied a quarter - final berth at last summer ’s @entity67 finals in @entity68 by a heart - breaking extra-time defeat by @entity71 , are currently in @entity72 on a mission to increase the gradient of the learning curve which has seen them emerge as an international force to be reckoned with			1
they lost 2 - 1 to @entity53 , currently third in @entity80 ’s world rankings , at @entity54 in @entity81 on friday evening , although @entity0 makes no apologies for pitching his players into battle with that kind of quality			1
he said : ' what we are trying in our process is to realise how the best teams in the world play the game and how we can one day really compete with them and beat them , so what does it take to beat a @entity97 ? what does it take to beat a @entity100 or a @entity68 or @entity101 one day and go eye - to - eye with them ? ' they set the tone			2
the tone is set also coming out of the @entity106 , the @entity106 sets the tone in terms of tactical changes that you see in the game or how certain teams are put together by the best coaches in the world			0
the 34 - year - old striker , who has scored 65 goals for his country , won his 138th cap at @entity120 ' we develop things looking at those things , but at the same time looking at our talent pool and seeing how much we can do in order to catch up and see how we can challenge them at the end of the day , because we have our own different characteristics in certain ways			0
” the trip to @entity131 has also brought back memories for @entity0 , who scored his first goal for @entity134 in a pre-season friendly against @entity136 in @entity137 back in august 1994			2
he said : ' it was many moons ago			0
yes , i have memories about that			0
obviously i was at @entity134 a few times last week and saw my old team - mates			0
they are nice memories to have			0
' i was surprised how many @entity134 fans lived in @entity131 - i think there were 12,000 people and 11,000 were @entity134 , so good memories			0

@entity2 will miss the @entity3 's game against the @entity51
@entity1 manager @entity0 admits he repeatedly uses @entity2 as an example of what it takes to succeed as a player
