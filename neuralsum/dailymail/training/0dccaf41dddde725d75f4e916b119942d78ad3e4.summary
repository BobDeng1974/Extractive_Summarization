' order broke down and members of the @entity105 demanded that @entity13 abdicate			1

@entity176 , who also went by the names @entity178 and @entity179 , later moved to the @entity180 and was portrayed for decades as the escaped daughter of the last @entity53 emperor			1
but in 1991 , when the remains of the @entity15 royals were unearthed , dna testing proved that the bodies were indeed those of the @entity102 , @entity187 and their children			0

' they have failed and we must now shoot you			0
' the @entity102 rose from his chair and only had time to utter ' what ... ? ' before he was shot several times in the chest			2
