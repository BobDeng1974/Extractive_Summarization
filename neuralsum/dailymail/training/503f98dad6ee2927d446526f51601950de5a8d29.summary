by @entity0 published : 14:54 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 15:43 est , 9 september 2013 somewhere on the bottom of @entity3 's largest lake lie the remains of two dozen @entity6 soldiers who died when their amphibious vehicle sank in 1945 in the waning days of the fighting in @entity9 during @entity10 a volunteer group 's discovery of what could be the wreckage 900 feet down in @entity15 has given aging veterans hope that , after nearly seven decades , the remains of their comrades can finally come home			1
' if you talk to the @entity10 guys , they 're looking for closure and they have n't got it , ' said retired @entity25 col @entity24 , president of the @entity26 of the @entity27 , the @entity25 unit that battled the @entity28 in northern @entity3 until the last week of the war			2
only one soldier survived - a former lifeguard of the association 's nearly 1,200 members , about a third served during @entity10 ' we seem to save any single soldier or find anybody in the wilds of @entity52 or the mountains , and we thought it was very bad that the @entity6 was n't doing anything for these guys , ' said 89 - year - old @entity57 , of @entity58 , @entity59 @entity57 was laying communication wire as the @entity27 pursued @entity28 forces into northern @entity3 's rugged alpine region , home to the 50 - mile - long @entity15			1
location : @entity15 is a popular holiday destination in the north of @entity3 , located between @entity67 and @entity68 when the enemy blew up tunnels through the mountains ringing the lake 's northern end , the division 's commanders sent soldiers across the lake in amphibious six - wheeled trucks , known by their military designation dukw and known to gis as ducks			1
on the night of april 30 , 1945 , three @entity82 left the lake 's east side carrying members of the division 's 605th @entity86			2
one of the vehicles , jammed with 25 soldiers and a 75 mm cannon , stalled during the journey and soon began taking on water			0
today : the @entity93 - formed @entity15 is the largest lake in @entity3			1
it is 50 miles long and reaches depths of over a thousand feet returning the dead : for years , veterans and family members of those lost in the lake have been calling for a recovery mission proof : but the military authority which deals with recovering the bodies of @entity6 solders said it will only investigate if there 's firm evidence that the remains have been located in the lake according to @entity110 , the lone survivor , the soldiers desperately tossed their equipment and ammunition overboard in an attempt to keep the vessel from sinking			1
but the dukw went down anyway , plunging the men into the frigid waters of the glacier - fed lake			0
soon all had drowned but @entity110 , a former lifeguard from @entity120 , @entity121 , who was rescued by two 10th @entity124 soldiers on shore who heard the cries for help			0
first try : a researcher in @entity131 , @entity129 traveled to the lake 10 years ago hoping to find the amphibious vehicle but was hampered by equipment issues and was ultimately unsuccessful @entity135 , a researcher from the @entity131 , @entity129 - based nonprofit underwater archaeology organization @entity137 , led an effort 10 years ago to find the sunken dukw			1
hampered by equipment issues , @entity135 found no sign of the vehicle			0
but in late 2011 , a local @entity3 group of volunteer divers started their own search			2
using sonar and a remotely operated vehicle equipped with a video camera , they announced last december the discovery of a @entity151 sitting upright on the lake bottom			2
take two : in late 2011 , a volunteer diver group in @entity3 started a search of their own @entity156 said it has n't been able to positively confirm that it 's the same dukw that sank , killing the 24 soldiers , or one of the other two known to have sunk in the same area of the lake			1
the group said it plans to resume efforts to locate remains and recover the dukw , possibly later this year or in early 2014			1
' seems to us only right to do everything possible in order to restore at least someone to their land , ' the group 's spokesman , @entity165 , said in an email to @entity0			0
recovery : the volunteer group announced last december that they had located the vehicle and hope to go on more recovery missions this year or early next year officials at the @entity179 , the @entity181 - based unit that searches for remains of @entity6 from foreign battlefields , said they 're aware of the group 's claims but do n't plan to investigate unless there 's firm evidence that remains have been located			1
' if @entity179 were to be provided with additional information , we would gladly look into it more , ' @entity188 , a spokesman at @entity179 's @entity190 headquarters , said in an email to the @entity0 the family of @entity195 would like to see his remains recovered and returned to his hometown of @entity198 , @entity199			0
when his great - nephew , @entity200 , learned of the @entity3 group 's discovery in december , he showed his aging relatives the video of the @entity151 on his smartphone			1
it was a particularly emotional moment for 86 - year - old @entity207 , @entity195 's sister			0
' she said , " i prayed over and over and over again that we would find @entity195 before i passed away , " ' @entity200 said			0
for @entity57 and the division 's dwindling number of @entity10 veterans , the determination to recover the lost soldiers ' remains has n't diminished with the passage of time			2
' it 's the old story , ' he said			0
' you never leave any man behind			0

twenty four @entity6 soldiers drowned in 1945 when their amphibious vehicle took on water in the *middle* of @entity3 's largest lake - @entity15
only one soldier survived the tragic sinking in the waning days of @entity10
until recently , efforts to locate and recover the vehicle and the soldiers ' remains have been largely unsuccessful
but this past december a volunteer @entity3 diving group announced that they had located the vehicle
they hope to carry out more recovery missions later this year or early next year
