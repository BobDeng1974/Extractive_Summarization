whether it 's being used as a swanky party venue , floating showroom or private vessel , the @entity0 is certainly a boat designed to turn heads			1
the 75 metre long vessel is an extravagant , multipurpose yacht which even comes with its own supercar			0
designed by @entity12 - based car designer @entity11 , the slick ship 's interior is decked out in @entity14 decor , with classic touches like a @entity17 piano , a dual staircase , and fine crystal @entity21 lighting			1
but you 'll need @entity24 's bank account if you want to buy one			0
the lead - in price is 2 million euros ( £ 16million ) for a ' basic ' model			0
keeping with its automotive theme , the @entity0 has space for a car showroom and ' engine room ' , complete with exposed engines displayed behind glass walls			2
solar panels fold out from under a sleek car - hood - like deck to power the ship , and the panels double up as a concert space or helipad with space for three helicopters			1
the fly deck even features a @entity43 , and by night , the superyacht glows in the dark thanks to @entity47 lighting			2
as for the @entity0 's price ? ' as far as investments go , the 75 m luxury yacht @entity0 concept resembles more of a real estate and marketing venture than a yacht			2

it feels as large as an airplane hangar , but with an @entity75 vibe can we make it a car showroom ? apparently so , this boat is big enough to take an entire fleet of @entity81 opulence : sofa space for chilling out , tick			0
but where 's the television ? and where better to chill out and watch the sunset than atop the deck ... hang on , is that a band playing up there ? it may look like a deep sea creature from the abyssal plains but this is just the megayacht with its lights on after dark and of course every megayacht needs a megacar for those all important onshore errands			0
right , have we run out of champagne again ? slimline : solar panels fold out from under a sleek car - bonnet - like deck to power the ship and so to bed : by night , the superyacht glows in the dark thanks to @entity110 lighting			1
