' we had about six or seven bidders at the auction - a mixture of residential developers , investors , potential occupiers and artists			0
however , the number of bidders quickly dropped as the price went up			0
' mr @entity48 put down the high price to @entity2 ’s housing crisis - with demand for properties far outstripping supply			1
he said : ' free - hold properties of this type are very scarce , and there is a high demand for properties like this in the area			0
the marker ' a ' shows where the garage is situated in south @entity2 's @entity13 a view from the road which shows the entrance to the garage in south @entity2 ' a terraced house here sells for between £ 500,000 and £ 600,000 and the coach house , subject to planning permission , would make a good home			1
' he added any buyer wishing to turn it into a house , could expect to invest £ 100,000 in it			1
more than 200 artists and small business owners working in the court signed a petition opposing @entity52 ’s sale of the building on the grounds any new owners would object to the noise created by the ' busy and thriving ' light industrial estate			0

the coach house sold for £ 150,000 more than the average house in @entity13 , pictured ( file photo ) mr @entity48 added : ' the coach house would make an ideal artist ’s studio and i ’ve heard rumours it has been bought by a wealthy artist to save it from being turned into housing , though i have n’t a clue if that is true			1
' cllr @entity135 , @entity9 ’s @entity136 , added : ' like most councils , @entity9 has experienced big cuts to our budgets in recent years , and we need to ensure we are making the most of all viable opportunities available to us to generate income			0
' we are therefore delighted to have sold this garage for such a good price , having already made savings from no longer running the @entity148 car it housed			1
' the proceeds will help the council to invest in our capital programme which pays for improvements to libraries , parks and facilities for older people , for example , allowing us to continue delivering excellent services for all our residents			0
' the @entity13 garage is not the only @entity2 lock - ups with a hefty asking price			1
many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential			0
in 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in @entity172 went on the market with a whopping £ 1.25million asking price			2
but the new owner could rest assured that they would own property in the same trendy area as @entity179			0
in 2012 a 6 - metre long garage went on the market for £ 525,000 , but that was because of its pricey postcode in @entity21 - home to @entity20 and some of the world 's richest people			2
in october 2013 a double garage sold in @entity188 sold for a cool £ 251,000			2
for the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages , and there is an option of connecting to water on - site			0
