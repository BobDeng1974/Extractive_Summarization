@entity0 is urging @entity1 to bid for the next @entity2 in @entity3 , standing firm on @entity5 and @entity6 as hosts for 2018 and 2022 and promising to speed up the introduction of more new technology			1
the @entity11 president approaches another four - year term in office promising to step up the fight against racism , with the imposition of punitive points deductions and expulsion from cup competitions			1
he will use the awarding of a women ’s tournament to @entity22 as football ’s instrument in the campaign for female equality in the @entity28 world			0
he reports , also , on how @entity11 is working as a force for reconciliation between @entity31 and @entity32			2
video @entity0 discussing @entity6 and @entity5 with @entity34 ahead of @entity35 outspoken : @entity11 president @entity0 ( left ) has given an exclusive interview to @entity37 's @entity34 ( right ) head of the global game : @entity0 spoke on a number of crucial issues surrounding world football all this , and more , emerges from @entity0 ’s first major interview since @entity45 2014			1
this exclusive discussion was conducted by me at @entity11 headquarters in @entity49 for premier screening to thousands of delegates at the opening of the @entity53 in @entity54 on monday morning			2
@entity0 expresses his profound delight at the success of @entity45 2014 , as well as his gratitude to the @entity45 people for justifying his optimism that their love of the @entity62 would not let their socio - economic protests spoil ‘ this great @entity2			1
’ he also reveals the multi-billion - dollar scale of @entity11 ’s income during this four - year @entity2 cycle and its distribution of a high proportion of that wealth to aid the development of football around the world			1
all - round success : @entity0 was delighted with @entity45 for a great @entity2 , which was won by @entity75 coming home : before a @entity2 can be held in @entity1 it will likely visit @entity78 , as it did in 2010 final venue ? @entity80 could host just its second @entity2 final - after 1966 - if @entity0 is to be believed @entity82 , it emerges , advised @entity11 ’s president in advance of his decision not to stand against his re-election next year , but to remain at the head of @entity88			1
thus @entity0 predicts growing unity between the two bodies , totally discounting any possibility of star players with major @entity3 clubs ever boycotting the @entity2 , ‘ the high - point of their careers			1
’ that said , he went on to announce that he will formally confirm his candidacy for four more years in the next few weeks			0
that may be the worst - kept secret in sport			0
but making it official for the first time enabled him to address the corruption accusations that have been dogging the governing body of the world game			0
brothers in arms : @entity0 sees @entity82 's @entity88 growing closer to @entity11 in the coming years friends ? it now looks like @entity82 will not rival @entity0 for the @entity11 crown as he goes for re-election in so doing @entity0 offers a rare , personal insight into himself as a football - loving man , as he admits how deeply hurt he was by allegations in an @entity118 newspaper which attempted to connect him to any wrong - doing			2
his reminder to the world that he has been totally exonerated is passionately delivered , as is his assurance that the independent investigation being led by @entity124 lawyer @entity123 will be completely transparent and honest			0
he asks only that all such deliberations and any critical discussions are conducted with mutual respect , not the heated discourtesy which he sees as having reflecting poorly on the game			0
experience : @entity80 has hosted a @entity133 final , an @entity135 final and is in line for the big one @entity3 choice : an @entity118 - held @entity2 is possible in 2030 - but it might host @entity138 2020 's final too on the @entity118 question , raised after @entity141 ’s outburst against him at a @entity11 convention in @entity45 , @entity0 makes it clear that he ‘ likes ’ the new @entity145 chairman , holds no grudge and is sure he will be ‘ respectful ’ next time they meet			1
he also urges @entity141 to step back from vowing that @entity1 will never again bid for the @entity2 while he is @entity11 president			1
that statement was born of @entity1 ’s angst at their high - profile bid team securing only one vote in the ballot for 2018 but @entity0 says : ‘ you have to be prepared to accept losing – and of course be ready to bid again			1
’ however , the earliest @entity1 could host the @entity159 is 2030			2
beauty : @entity0 is determined to bring a @entity2 to the @entity161 and says @entity6 will go ahead stunning vision : the stadiums in @entity6 have been unveiled and all feature futuristic designs @entity0 expects that under the rotation system , @entity6 will almost certainly be followed in 2026 by either an @entity78 contender , a joint staging by @entity169 and @entity170 , or the @entity171 following the huge tv audiences recorded in @entity173 for @entity45 2014			1
of the @entity6 controversy , he explains ‘ the need to take the @entity2 to the @entity161 for the first time ’ and adds that @entity11 are ‘ totally committed ’ to that decision			1
he confirms that the tournament will be moved to the cool of winter , although the precise timing will not be resolved until after discussions this week about re-scheduling the @entity3 club season that winter			0
still coming : no world stars , including the likes of @entity185 , will boycott a @entity2 , says @entity0 of the @entity5 controversy , @entity0 says that while @entity11 will ‘ continue to monitor ’ the situation in @entity189 ‘ we are already working with @entity5 to prepare for that @entity2			1
’ he also reasserts @entity11 ’s principle of resisting the interference of politics in football			2
of the call by some @entity196 ambassadors for a boycott , he says : ‘ they never do any good			0
’ on the issue of racist abuse – be it evident in players , team officials or fans - he is urging the application of regulations already in place for points to be deducted or offending clubs to be thrown out of even the most important cups			2
while he admits that identifying offenders in crowds that can be infiltrated by rival fans , he anticipates extra security scrutiny and adds that ‘ sometimes you have to take a chance ’ to make progress			0
changes : @entity221 and other manages could be handed the chance to appeal against referees ' decisions @entity0 sees no risk in the next hi - tech step which will follow the success of goal - line technology			1
he is bringing forward trials for managers and coaches to be given two challenges in each half of a game against decisions			2
referees will be engaged in the review process , going to the touchline as soon as play is stopped to study the video replays			0
that innovation will be in place before the next @entity2			0
of the one just ended , he had ‘ no doubts ’ that @entity45 ’s stadia and infrastructure would be ready in time			0
he thanks all in that country for staying behind the @entity159 after their team were knocked out			0
he suspects , also , that the very decisive nature of @entity75 ’s seven - goal victory helped the @entity45 accept that exit without complaint and continue enjoying a magnificent tournament			0
success : @entity0 says he had ' no doubts ' that @entity45 would be ready in time for the @entity2 last summer that helped boost @entity11 ’s income from the @entity2 cycle to £ 2.7billion ‘ of which more than 70 per cent ’ will be dispersed to @entity45 and the nations in the @entity159 , or distributed among confederations and associations for the good of the game in all corners of the football world			1
and all that is but a taste of a fascinating conversation			0
the interview was filmed in one , unbroken take with no pauses for thought and no questions ducked .			0
