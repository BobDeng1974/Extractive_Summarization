a charity has been criticised for hiring two former soldiers to mount a 24 - hour guard over a stag to stop him being shot by hunters			1
the mature stag , called @entity7 , is well - known in @entity9 's @entity8 where the @entity10 has bought up land to make ' safe havens ' from hunts			1
but the campaign group is paying £ 15 an hour for a 24 - hour guard after claiming local hunters have tried to force the mature animal into areas where they are allowed shoot it			1
the @entity34 hunt has denied targeting the animal			2
a spokesman for the @entity10 said : ' we think hunt supporters tried to force him off one of our sanctuaries			1
' we have been forced to hire security experts this year			0
they are ex-soldiers from a private security firm and they are looking after him			0
' @entity44 , chief executive of the group , added : ' we own sporting rights and sanctuaries to provide safe havens for wildlife away from hunts so that animals can come and go as they please			0
' putting the lives of the animals residing there in danger will not be tolerated , which is why we took the decision to employ extra protection for @entity7			1
' the lengths these people will go to in order to kill an animal is astounding			0
no animal should have to suffer at the hands of these people and we are absolutely determined and resolute in our efforts to protect the wildlife they are so determined to kill			0
' safe : @entity7 has taken up residence on land bought by campaigners to create ' safe havens ' from hunting stag hunts permitted under the @entity76 are designed to control deer numbers by taking out older stags which would otherwise breed with their own offspring			1
the deer population on the @entity82 hills has reportedly steadily declined from around 1,000 before the rules were introduced , to around 500 now - a number which pro-hunters claim is better for the population			0
a meeting of the @entity88 - a team who carry out an annual deer count - heard last week that anti-hunt campaigner bought the land where @entity7 roams and sold it to a ' sympathetic buyer ' but still retain the hunting rights			2
members are now understood to be paying at least two guards £ 15 an hour each to keep up a vigil at the site			0
worthwhile ? the @entity28 has criticised the move , which it says advertises the stag 's location to poachers			1
meanwhile , local hunters the @entity34 hunt has denied targeting the animal pro-hunt group @entity28 questioned the logic of the @entity10 's tactics			1
spokeswoman @entity108 said : ' it seems singularly crazy for the @entity10 to highlight the whereabouts of this stag , which they claim to be so concerned about , to every poacher in the area			2
' i do not know how much it will cost the charity for their team of former soldiers to give the stag a round - the - clock bodyguard for the remainder of the shooting season but questions should be asked as to whether this is a suitable use of donations			0
' it also seems highly questionable for the @entity10 to claim to take so much care over one deer when conditions at their @entity129 got so bad a few years ago that over a 12 - month period 107 deer were found either dead or dying of starvation or disease			2
' @entity133 of the @entity134 has denied the group are planning to target @entity7 since last year .			0

@entity28 says *sending* in the guards will lead poachers to stag
@entity10 *insists* hunters have tried to get animal
member of the local hunt denies that @entity7 the stag is in any danger
