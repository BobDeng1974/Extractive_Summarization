with @entity2 ’s autumn series kicking off on saturday , sir @entity0 sets the scene for their four crucial matches			1
@entity5 : how do you see the @entity9 series going for @entity2 and where are @entity11 ’s team compared to yours at this stage 12 years ago ? sir @entity0 : the current group of @entity16 players is just as talented as the 2003 squad , but i just do n’t think we ’ve seen the right xv on the field playing the style of rugby required to win a @entity24			1
you need to create a team that can outscore any side in the world			2
let ’s be very clear : to win a @entity24 you have to be able to outscore the @entity30 sides and not just the @entity32 teams			1
can @entity2 beat @entity33 on saturday ? yes			1
can they win four out of four games ? absolutely			2
sir @entity0 's 2003 side lift the @entity38 trophy after winning the @entity24 in @entity39 @entity5 : you beat the southern hemisphere ’s top three in 2002			1
what did you say to the players before that series of matches ? @entity0 : at the beginning of a series like this everyone tries to figure out what an acceptable set of results will look like and what impact they will have on our chances at the @entity24			1
but ultimately it is all about the here and now and that was the approach we took in 2002			2
i made it clear to the players that there was n’t going to be any selection based on ‘ development ’			2
every team was picked to win the next game and nothing else			2
we staged the autumn tests as a series of ‘ knockout fixtures ’ to create that must - win - match attitude			2
we knew that if we won all three we would become the @entity76 ’s no 1 ranked team , which would make for a great @entity78			2
in public we played it down , but privately that was the goal at the end of these three ‘ knockout games ’			0
@entity2 captain @entity84 spins out a pass in training at @entity87 this week @entity5 : what do you put @entity2 ’s injury crisis down to ? @entity0 : during my time , there were all sorts of battles going on between clubs and the union over the management of the players and , specifically , how much rugby they were playing and how they were managed when they became injured			1
i was determined to be at the front of the discussions in order to get what i felt was best for the players and the @entity2 team			1
@entity108 , my first major disagreement with the @entity110 came when it was decided , without my input , that the clubs would not only lead on the medical well - being of a player , but it was their decision whether they played or not			0
the @entity110 ’s medical team believed they could ensure the player ’s well - being by simply working closely with the club doctors			0
i totally disagreed with that philosophy			0
players come under peer pressure			0
they are left in an impossible situation and end up playing when injured because they want to do what ’s best for their club			0
@entity130 centre @entity128 is expected to start for @entity2 at @entity131 on saturday @entity2 ’s current injury list has gone beyond simple bad luck			1
i would need more details before commenting on an individual basis , but @entity137 ’s problem surprises me			0
it appears from the outside as if he ’s been carrying the injury for some time while continuing to play for @entity142			2
why is he now missing @entity2 games ? are we now in a position where , because @entity2 are going to have all their top players from may , there is an acceptance the clubs are the priority until then ? that ca n’t be right			1
we have five of the starting xv injured and @entity153 looks like he needs a rest , too			0
i always encouraged the players to take individual responsibility for their well - being			0
collectively the players understood the bigger picture and the effect playing with injuries at club level had to our @entity2 ambitions			1
we should not be facing the three biggest teams in the world with so many injuries , and it ’s no surprise they are arriving with fully - fit squads			0
@entity137 was a late withdrawal from the @entity2 training squad with a neck injury @entity5 : so how does @entity11 approach the series ? @entity0 : frustrating though these injuries are , @entity2 have depth — and now is the time to prove that to @entity33 , @entity178 and @entity39			1
i would be seriously concerned leaving @entity131 for the last time before the @entity24 having been beaten by an @entity2 team depleted by injuries			1
@entity2 players wo n’t need reminding how great an opportunity this is to make the shirt their own , but privately i would still be winding players up			1
it ’s wrong to play down the @entity33 game and suggest that with our injuries it ’s merely a good chance to develop the squad			1
it ’s times like this that @entity196 will see everything he needs to from the peripheral players			0
can they cut it at the very top of the international game ? by the end of this series he ’ll know all he needs to know about guys such as @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity128			0
let ’s not hide behind development , team culture or valiant efforts			0
let ’s beat these teams and be bold about it			0
@entity209 gets a chance to start at lock with both @entity220 and @entity221 out injured @entity5 : which players excite you most going into the series ? @entity0 : it ’s a worry for me that no players immediately leap off the team - sheet as real x-factor types			2
@entity208 is a fantastic story and i ’m looking forward to seeing if he can translate his club form on to the international stage but , make no mistake , he ’s going to be targeted by the @entity33 on saturday			1
if he can withstand that and come through in credit then it will give him enormous confidence going into the rest of the series			0
but @entity208 is keeping some top - class wings out of the side in @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 — so he ’s got plenty to prove			0
@entity208 is likely to be targeted by the @entity33 on his @entity2 debut at @entity131 @entity5 : what about from the opposition ? @entity0 : @entity248 is such a powerful and destructive runner and absolutely superb under the high ball			1
he gives @entity39 a completely different attacking option with his pace and physicality			2
he ’s a brilliant player who will excite anyone who watches him			0
whoever the @entity39 play at 10 - 12 will also be a threat			1
they went for @entity257 and @entity258 against the @entity259 , but they have such an array of talent , with players such as @entity264 waiting in the wings , that their midfield combination is bound to be dangerous			0
the 20 - year - old fly - half was absolutely outstanding for the @entity178 as they beat the @entity33 when the sides last met			1
with a traditionally monstrous @entity178 pack in front of him , he looks a huge prospect			2
i ’m also a huge admirer of lock @entity277			0
he ’s a hugely powerful athlete who walks like a gunslinger and has an attitude to match			0
@entity178 lock @entity277 ( right ) is a player sir @entity0 is looking forward to seeing this autumn @entity5 : sorry for repeating myself , but can @entity2 really beat the @entity33 ? @entity0 : of course they can			1
the great thing for them is that public expectation levels are low because of the players missing			0
there ’s almost nothing to lose			0
they can cast off the shackles and play with a pace and tempo that gets the @entity131 crowd on their feet			1
i ’m excited by that prospect and i really hope the players are , too			0
@entity297 : @entity2 will be ready for the @entity24			1

@entity2 face @entity33 , @entity178 and @entity39 this autumn
all *blacks* are the first to play at @entity131 this saturday
final chance to play ' big three ' before next year 's @entity24
