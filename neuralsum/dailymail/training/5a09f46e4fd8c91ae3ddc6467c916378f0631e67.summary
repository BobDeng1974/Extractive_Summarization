the state medical examiner ruled that @entity19 , 49 , died from drowning as well as fatal amount of @entity21 , and said this week he could not determine whether her death was a homicide or suicide , but could be certain that it was not accidental			1
respected doctor : @entity14 appeared withdrawn as he entered court for his preliminary hearing in the case of his ex-wife 's death horror : @entity17 , a mother of four , was found dead in her bathtub in september 2011 with a knife under her body and blood splattered nearby police called the death suspicious when it occurred in september 2011 but no charges were filed against @entity14 until april of this year			1
@entity40 district attorney @entity39 said there was n’t one single piece of evidence that finally led to the charges			0
instead , he said , a combination of factors played a role , including dna evidence under the victim ’s fingernails that did n’t rule out @entity14 ; the fact that @entity19 died in part due to an overdose of @entity21 but did n’t have a prescription and was not depressed ; and @entity14 ’s inability to explain his whereabouts the night of her death			1
trial : @entity14 will face first - degree felony counts of murder and aggravated burglary in connection with the october 2011 death of his ex-wife , @entity65 the body of @entity17 , 49 , was discovered in an overflowing bathtub in her home on 27 september 2011			1
a knife was found under her body , and she had cuts and abrasions not consistent with suicide			0
police said there was evidence of a struggle , and that the crime scene looked posed			0
an autopsy revealed @entity19 also had a large amount of @entity21 in her system at the time of her death - a drug she was not known to take and for which she did not have a prescription			1
according to the @entity91 , the prosecution told the court that @entity14 did have a prescription for @entity21 , and that he also made out a prescription for his mother for a large dose of the drug , which was filled shortly before @entity19 's death			1
both the prosecution and the defense had myriad theories as to how the drugs came to be in @entity19 's system , including the possibility that @entity14 injected @entity105 with the drug , and that he used his skills as a doctor to persuade her to take it			2
the prosecution told the court that all evidence points towards @entity14 being in the house at the time of his ex-wife 's death , and that the doctor had a motive			2
police found blood stains and overturned objects in the victim ’s bedroom			0
the back door had been unlocked , prosecutors say , and a key was missing from its hiding place			0

charging documents indicate police interviewed about 30 people while investigating the killing			0

if it was me , i do n’t remember			0
' today judge @entity10 supported his decision to send @entity14 to trial , saying that @entity14 had developed a deep anger and hatred for his ex-wife over a long period of time			2
