@entity1 ’s power stations are still pumping out increasing amounts of greenhouse gases while families face a rise in taxes designed to cut emissions			1
the escalation in pollution levels comes as the average household is being forced to contribute £ 112 in green taxes each year			0
by the end of the decade , families will have to pay almost £ 300 a year to fund renewable energy , such as wind and nuclear , as well as insulating older homes			0
both policies are being heavily promoted by the government in a bid to cut the nation ’s carbon dioxide gas emissions in order to meet stringent international targets			2
@entity1 power stations ' emissions have increased , while @entity1 families are set to shell out £ 300 for renewable energy by 2020 but last year , the levels of the gas pumped out by @entity1 ’s energy companies increased by 4 per cent compared to 2011 , as the amount of coal burnt for power leapt up by a quarter			1
for each unit of energy , coal produces double the amount of carbon dioxide than gas or oil			0
the @entity1 is one of only four @entity42 countries that have increased pollution from power production , with only @entity45 doing worse			1
the other 23 @entity47 nations managed to reduce emissions from power companies			1
carbon dioxide accounts for more than 80 per cent of @entity1 ’s total greenhouse gas emissions			1
with 40 per cent of emissions coming from the energy sector and only 15 per cent produced by households , critics say targeting families while increasing output from power stations is pointless			1
dr @entity59 of the @entity60 , which publishes energy data , said : ‘ it is unreasonable that hard - pressed householders are being made to fund increasingly expensive and diverse energy policies which these latest figures show are clearly not working			0
’ taxpayers will face extra tax to fund renewable power sources such as wind and nuclear the latest estimated emission figures were produced by @entity72 , the @entity74 ’s statistical arm , which found that across the @entity47 , carbon dioxide output for energy use had gone down by 2.1 per cent			1
a @entity72 spokesman said : ‘ at the moment , the global price for hard coal is down and we see in the @entity1 a huge increase in its use – 27 per cent compared to the previous year – while gas and oil use has fallen			2
’ since 1990 , there has been an overall decrease in @entity1 carbon dioxide emissions of around 19 per cent			2
in 2011 , @entity1 delivered the biggest emissions cuts in the @entity47 , reducing total greenhouse gas output by 40 million tons , a fall of 7 per cent			1
earlier this week , energy secretary @entity91 said he will push for the @entity47 to adopt the most stringent green targets in the world			0
he said he would seek a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50 per cent by 2030 , compared to 1990 levels			2
a spokesman for the @entity98 said : ‘ cheaper coal relative to gas has resulted in a short - term increase in the amount of carbon emissions from @entity1 power stations			1
the amount of coal generation is expected to decline rapidly by 2020 as a result of our move to a low carbon economy			0
‘ global gas prices have primarily been pushing up household energy bills – not green subsidies			0
‘ investing in home - grown alternatives is the only sure - fire way of insulating our economy and bill - payers from international energy price volatility			0
‘ our household energy - efficiency policies are more than offsetting the costs of clean energy investment			0
by 2020 the average household bill will be £ 166 lower than it would be if we were doing nothing			0

meanwhile , gas pumped out by power stations jumped 4 per cent
@entity1 is one of just four @entity47 nations that has increased emissions
