by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 19 september 2013 a teenager who was smuggled into the @entity2 from @entity3 after the @entity4 slaughtered his father and brother has won the right to remain in the @entity2			1
aspiring teacher @entity8 , 19 , said he owes a debt of gratitude to the @entity2 people who successfully backed his right to remain - including his adoptive family in @entity14			1
mr @entity15 , who made a six - month journey to the @entity2 after fleeing his war - torn homeland as an 11 - year - old in 2006 , would have had to return to @entity3 under @entity21 regulations when he reached the age of 18			1
relief : @entity24 was set to be deported back to @entity3 , but his foster family and friends in @entity14 rallied to his cause he secured 13 gcses and a handful of a-levels while living with a foster family in @entity14 , but was fearful that he would be sent back to @entity32 - a journey he said would result in his death at the hands of @entity4 fighters			1
but he has been told that the application to remove him has failed and - barring a final appeal from the @entity21 - he will be granted a visa that will allow him to stay in the @entity2			1
speaking from his foster family ’s home in @entity42 , @entity14 , he said : ' i am so grateful			1
once i have the paperwork sorted i want to go to university to become a pe teacher			2
' when i heard i won the case i was shouting and screaming , jumping all over the room			0
' there is n’t the chance for education in @entity3 for me			1
here it is completely different			0
' i honour this country , it has given me so much			0
i have learned something every day i have been to school			0
' i want to be something in the future			0
i want to teach so i can give something back to this country			0
' mr @entity8 - who speaks four languages - was described as a ' son and brother ' by his foster family , who covered more than £ 1,600 in legal fees after an 11th - hour reprieve stalling his flight to the @entity3 capital prompted a series of tribunal hearings			1
integrated : mr @entity8 said he wants to become a @entity2 citizen he has not seen his mother since she begged him to seek safety in @entity73			1
the @entity3 said he first fled to @entity74 before walking for days and nights on end and hiding on - board freight transport destined for @entity78			1
he was eventually fostered by @entity79 and @entity80 , who already had two young sons , @entity82 and @entity83			0
now an active member of @entity85 , the @entity87 teenager said he feels fully immersed in western culture and hopes to become a @entity2 citizen			1
he said ; ' living with @entity79 is like living with my real family			2
i love them and i love being with them			0
' to be in this family is like feeling safe			2
it would be really hard for me ( to go back to @entity3 )			1
' i have already lost one family , i do n’t want to lose a second one			2
' mr @entity8 said he was terrified at the prospect of being sent on a plane to @entity32 and left to fend completely for himself , and admitted he faced an anxious wait until the end of next week - the deadline for the @entity21 to lodge an appeal			1
but he has been warmed by a petition of signatures backing his right to remain in the @entity2 , collected while he was being held in an immigrant holding centre ahead of his intended removal			1
' i do n’t know who most of these people ( who signed the petition ) are , ' he said			2
' but the public was behind me , so i just want to say a huge thank - you to them , otherwise i would n’t be here now , i ’d be in @entity3			1
' mr @entity115 said the decision by the @entity117 of the @entity118 , sitting in @entity119 , was heavily weighted on the impact removing mr @entity8 would have on his sons , aged nine and 11			2
retired firefighter and full - time foster parent mr @entity115 , 43 , added : “ it ’s been a very long process			2
' i think it ’s been a bit of a witch - hunt against @entity128 because he has never done anything wrong since he has been in this country			2
he has worked so hard and taken every opportunity			0
' when @entity128 was removed ( to the holding centre ) , they just could n’t understand it			0
“ there are terrorists in this country who they ( the @entity21 ) ca n’t deport , then they are picking on a lad who wants to become a pe teacher and can speak four languages and is going to be an asset to this country			1
war - torn : the teenager fled @entity3 in 2006 and has not seen his family since ' i ca n’t understand why the @entity21 keep going after him			1
” he said the @entity21 would have to find a point of law to be granted permission to appeal in the case			2
' it ’s been nearly three years of legal battles ( starting before mr @entity8 was an adult ) , ' he said			0
' we have n’t always had legal aid and so have had to find some funding ourselves			0
but it has been amazing because even strangers have been handing over cheques to help because they believe @entity128 should stay			0
' " to be in this family is like feeling safe ... ' i have already lost one family , i do n’t want to lose a second one			0
" @entity8 , 19 @entity166 , who met mr @entity8 through his cricket club , said he had been inundated with people wanting to sign a petition calling for the @entity3 national to be allowed to remain in the @entity2			1
thousands added their names to the document , while local mp @entity174 also backed the campaign			0
mr @entity166 said : ' i first met @entity128 when he first came to @entity176			0
he told me his story and i can remember he said he wanted a new life and put his old life behind him			0
' i was struck by how he came across , what a pleasant young man he was			0
' he has come to this country , worked hard , and has kept his religion and faith while fully embracing western culture			0
in many ways , he is just the sort of person we should fight to keep in our country			0
' @entity192 mp mr @entity174 echoed his pleasure at the ruling , and said : ' when so many undesirable people are allowed to remain in our country , i thought it was quite indefensible that @entity24 should be sent back to a country in which he has no relatives and no hope of a decent future			2
' i am confident that with the help of his adopted family and friends , @entity24 will become a hard - working member of our local community			1
