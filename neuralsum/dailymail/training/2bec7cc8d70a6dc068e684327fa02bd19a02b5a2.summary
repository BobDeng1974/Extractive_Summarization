a @entity1 anarchist group has successfully produced the first - ever gun produced on a @entity4 printer and made entirely of plastic parts			1
an era of unlicensed plastic guns , made on @entity4 printers costing as little as $ 1,000 , has long been forecast , but no one has previously designed a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition			1
on sunday , the group @entity13 posted a video of founder @entity15 firing the ' @entity17 ' plastic pistol			1
mr @entity15 says he plans to make the schematics for the weapon available for free online this week - meaning everyone with a high - end @entity4 printer can create their own version of the gun			1
bang : this is the moment defense distributed founder @entity15 successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a @entity4 printer crude : the @entity17 plastic gun is a simple single - shot weapon that fires a small .380 - caliber bullet on the same day , @entity33 senator @entity32 announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban the weapons because they can pass through metal detectors at airports and court houses without being picked up			1
' we ’re facing a situation where anyone -- a felon , a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable			0
it ’s stomach - churning , ' he said			0
sixteen of the 17 parts in the @entity17 pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the @entity52 3d printer			1
the final piece of the weapons - the firing pin - is a common nail			1
mr @entity15 told @entity57 that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them			0
it is a bid , he says , to keep governments accountable to the people			0
' you can print a lethal device			0
it ’s kind of scary , but that ’s what we ’re aiming to show , ' he said			0
' anywhere there ’s a computer and an internet connection , there would be the promise of a gun			0
' plastic : sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the @entity17 are plastic , constructed by a @entity4 printer			1
a small nail is used for a firing pin the name of the @entity85 - comes from a simple @entity87 pistol that was designed by the @entity89 military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied @entity92 and concentration camps			1
like its @entity87 predecessor , the @entity13 pistol is a crude weapon			2
it holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore			0
shocking : @entity33 senator @entity32 plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from @entity4 printers @entity4 printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine , to construction to aerospace			1
the process , also called additive manufacturing , creates a three - dimensional solid object from a digital model			2
the feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic			0
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			0
the machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			0
the process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s			0
however , since 2010 , an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3 - d printers , which are increasingly small , increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable			1
@entity13 used a higher - end $ 8,000 model to build its @entity4 gun			1
however entry - level desktop models can cost $ 500 to $ 1,000			0
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
engineers hope 3 - d printing will begin an era of ' instant prototyping ' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively			2
the group has successfully fired it with a .380 - caliber pistol round			0
however , an attempt to shoot a slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces			0
currently , the @entity17 can only be made through highly specialized processes on an $ 8,000 3 - d printer			1
mr @entity15 says he hopes to adapt the model the technology behind 3 - d printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades			2
it is only since about 2010 , though , that 3 - d printers have become cheap enough , simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to purchase			2
@entity32 says the accessibility of @entity4 printers makes plastic guns a security threat			1
' guns are made out of plastic , so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event , ' @entity32 said , according @entity174			1
' only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors , for instance , when you go through an airport			1
' a terrorist , someone who ’s mentally ill , a spousal abuser , a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage			0
' @entity32 wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new bill would add a ban on plastic high - capacity magazines			1
' people have made silencers , stocks , triggers and lots of other gun parts			0
they can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone with one of these printers – and the printers cost about $ 1,000 – can make one , ' @entity32 said			2
current law bans all - plastic weaponry			2
defense distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle , to get around the law			2
@entity32 says the metal can be swapped out and replaced with plastic			2
the future of weapons ? the @entity4 printed gun being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home process : video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each pat had been @entity4 printed and cleaned			1

@entity13 posted video on sunday of founder shooting all - plastic gun made on an $ 8,000 3 - d printer
pistol uses only one metal piece - a small nail for the firing pin
senator @entity32 , a @entity33 @entity238 , called for a ban on @entity4 - printed guns
