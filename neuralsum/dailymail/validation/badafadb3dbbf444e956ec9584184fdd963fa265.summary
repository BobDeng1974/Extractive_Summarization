@entity2 's former @entity1 captain @entity0 remains convinced it is ' very unlikely ' the record - breaking batsman will ever play for @entity5 again			1
@entity2 , sacked by the @entity6 after the 2013 - 14 @entity8 defeat , has set his heart on pushing for a return in time for this summer 's rematch			1
the 34 - year - old signed for @entity13 on wednesday , to that end - and after indications from new @entity6 chairman @entity15 that he may yet be considered again for selection , he is hoping a welter of county championship runs over the next two months could press his claims			0
@entity0 ( right ) believes @entity2 's efforts to play himself back into the @entity5 for thei summer 's series with @entity23 will be in vain @entity2 has rejoined @entity13 and will attempt to find his form in the @entity26 @entity2 in action for @entity13 during a @entity29 fixture at the @entity30 last summer @entity0 , however , predicts @entity2 's efforts will be in vain			1
the dual @entity8 - winning captain believes @entity2 's age and history of confrontation are against him , and suggests his only realistic chance of resuming his international career is if an ' extraordinary ' sequence of events first cost either or both of coach @entity43 and @entity1 captain @entity44 their jobs			1
@entity0 had his own difficult times with his fellow @entity49 - born batsman , including the 2012 saga in which @entity2 admitted sending ' provocative ' texts about his captain to opposition players			2
the contents of @entity2 's autobiography , published five months ago and including much criticism of several ex-colleagues and management staff , may be another barrier to his recall			0
@entity0 told @entity61 : ' if you just look at everything that has gone on in the past ... his book ... that 's a significant hurdle he 'll have to get over			0
' then also , from a cricketing point of view , in one - day cricket we 've got to build towards the next @entity69			0
@entity0 and @entity2 together during happier times - the victorious 2011 @entity1 series against @entity72 the pair celebrate with the trophy after @entity5 's victory in that 2011 series with @entity72 ' @entity2 ( will be ) 36 years of age , ( so ) i ca n't see how he would necessarily play in that			1
' also , in the test match arena , our top five or six have all been in excellent form			0
' so it 's not as if there is an obvious place in the side for him either			0
' @entity5 will head to the @entity86 next week , for three tests , and @entity15 has already made it clear he will not tolerate defeat there against ' mediocre ' opposition			1
@entity93 ' hint that @entity2 's @entity5 career might not be finished after all is at odds , meanwhile , with all other public remarks from within the @entity6			2
@entity0 appears impressed by @entity2 's willingness to play county cricket again , after agreeing his release from the majority of his @entity102 contract with @entity103			2
but he will still be shocked if it leads to an @entity5 return			2
' i think you ca n't fault his ambition , ' @entity0 added			0
@entity2 and @entity0 at the crease together during @entity5 's @entity1 series with @entity111 in @entity112 in 2012 @entity2 was axed by @entity5 following unrest during last winter 's turbulent @entity8 tour to @entity23 ' he 's doing everything right , putting himself in position			1
he felt that @entity15 offered him an olive branch , and he 's taking it with both hands ... obviously he 's going to have to go out there and score runs			0
' but i have to say i still think it 's very unlikely that he 'll play for @entity5 again			0
' it 's going to take something extraordinary , @entity5 to lose a lot of games and for @entity2 to score a lot of runs - and probably for a captain or a coach , or both , to lose their jobs in the process			1
' @entity0 senses too that it will be this summer or never for @entity2 , who will be 35 by the time the @entity8 begin in july			1
' i 'd be surprised if he plays in this @entity8 series - and if he does n't , then it 's counter-intuitive that he would then come back in the side when they 'd be building again towards the next ashes series in two - and - a - half years ' time			0
' there would have to be a lot of things that go wrong with the @entity5 cricket team between now and the start of the ashes for him to come back			2

@entity2 has joined @entity13 aiming to return to @entity1 team
but his former skipper @entity0 believes it is ' very unlikely '
@entity0 believes @entity44 and @entity43 would have to lose jobs before @entity2 was allowed to return
@entity5 head to the @entity86 next week for three tests
they face @entity159 and @entity23 at home over the summer
