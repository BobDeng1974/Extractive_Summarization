by @entity1 reporter published : 20:39 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 28 october 2013 prisoners should have access to computers and the internet to help with reintegration into society and reduce reoffending once they are released , according to research			1
secure , controlled use of the web can also transform education , family contact and resettlement in jails , the joint @entity11 and @entity12 report said			1
through the @entity19 : how computers can transform rehabilitation examines the use of information and communication technology ( @entity25 ) in prisons and its potential as a tool for rehabilitation			0
a report has called for prisoners to have secure , controlled access to computers and the internet it is based on a survey of jails sent to all prison governors and directors in @entity40 and @entity41 supported by the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
nearly three quarters ( 74 per cent ) of the prison governors and managers who responded to the survey agreed that prisoners should have secure and controlled access to the internet , while 94 per cent agreed @entity25 skills were necessary for everyday living			1
three quarters ( 67 per cent ) said that prisoners should be able to set up bank accounts while in prison using @entity25			1
the report said greater and more effective use of @entity25 in prisons would improve opportunities for education , training , employment , resettlement and strengthen family ties - all factors which have been shown to reduce reoffending on release			1
nearly half ( 47 per cent ) of adults are reconvicted within one year of release			0
for those serving sentences of less than 12 months and young people aged 18 - 20 this increases to 58 per cent			0
in 2011 - 12 , just 27 per cent of prisoners entered employment on release from prison			2
the main barriers for prisons using @entity25 to improve rehabilitation were concerns about security , financial constraints , the lack of a co-ordinated strategy , licensing and insufficient central resources , researchers found			0
in the foreword to the report , @entity89 , @entity90 chief inspector of prisons , wrote : ' we ca n’t go on with prisons in a pre-internet dark age : inefficient , wasteful and leaving prisoners woefully unprepared for the real world they will face on release			2
' i have not met one prison professional who does not think drastic change is needed			0
' he added : ' of course , there are security issues that need to be managed but the technology itself allows every key stroke to be monitored and access can be risk - assessed			0
' perhaps there are some who will say computers and the internet are luxuries prisoners should do without			0
there was probably some grumbling when they first put telephones on the wings too and if we want prisons to rehabilitate those they hold , we have to give them the tools to do so			0
' the report said internet access could transform education , family contact and resettlement in jails @entity127 , director of the @entity11 , said : ' controlled use of @entity25 is a sensible way to bring prisons and prisoners into the 21st century			1
' closing the digital divide between people in prison and the community is vital for effective rehabilitation and resettlement			2
' @entity138 , chief executive , @entity12 , said : ' these days most people could not function without computers or the internet and if we ca n’t work , find a job or study without the use of @entity25 , how can we expect people in prison to do so ? ' technology can provide us with many solutions to help rehabilitate people in a safe , secure way and if we do not explore them , then we risk sending more people back into society without the skills or the motivation to live a life free from crime			2
