but he suggested that the tax system was still penalising people who were struggling to make ends meet			1
he told @entity39 ’s today programme : ‘ and there are people – i ’ve had these stories too – with one person in a family working , paying what they consider to be an inordinate burden of tax so that that keeps them in poverty			1
‘ these are complex matters and i ’m not pretending that they ’re simple ; i ’m just saying what i see and hear is people left in destitution and in a country of our wealth that should n’t happen			1
’ nearly 500,000 people in the @entity8 needed support from food banks last year , according to figures from the @entity64			2
the archbishop said : ‘ the fact that people are left in destitution is a disgrace			1
the fact of people left for weeks on end without any support and therefore having to have recourse for food banks in a country as affluent as our is a disgrace			2
‘ i accept a reform of the welfare system is necessary			1
it is a complex , difficult thing to achieve			2
i accept that these things were unintended consequences of reform			2
‘ my concern is to echo the voices that come to me of the circumstances today - people are hungry , destitute			2
‘ there must be something wrong with the administration that has that effect on so many people 's lives			0
i believe that is an issue that can be tackled			0

speaking from the archbishop 's @entity136 in @entity99 ahead of his departure to @entity139 , the archbishop identified @entity127 as an example of where the benefits of immigration could be seen			1
he said : ‘ it is perfectly clear in this city if you are up early and on the tubes early in the morning , the people coming in to this city to make sure it carries on working are the immigrant communities			0
‘ if you go to the @entity154 you know very well that a lot of its work and ongoing survival and service is down to immigrant communities			0
‘ i think we really should have a positive appreciation of the contribution that people who come to this country make to our well - being and economy			0
i think the idea that immigrants are a net drain on our economy is false			0

’ he added : ‘ i think it is - quite frankly - a lack of political leadership if we fashion a debate around fear			0
i think leaders ought to appeal to something more normal and more substantial than fear			0
