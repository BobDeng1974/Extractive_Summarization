by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 18:21 est , 12 july 2013 a primary school teacher accused of sending ‘ lewd ’ sex messages to a teenage boy who then committed suicide has been cleared after a dramatic last - ditch intervention by @entity8 lawyers			1
a judge was set to rule on the case of @entity11 , 34 , after a trial heard he sent sexually explicit text messages to 16 - year - old @entity14 about having sex in his school uniform			1
a court heard @entity11 asked @entity14 , a prefect pupil and father - of - one from @entity19 , @entity20 , about the size of his manhood and described him as a ‘ horny lad ’			1
@entity14 hanged himself after his girlfriend @entity24 , pictured with baby @entity25 , found the messages the court was told that the teacher also sent indecent images of himself to the teenager along with an explicit video of two men performing a sex act			1
@entity14 ’s girlfriend found messages on his phone and confronted the ‘ confused ’ teenager			1
he disappeared from home and was later found hanged			2
but yesterday the senior legal advisor to the director of public prosecutions @entity39 , ordered the @entity41 in @entity42 to drop the prosecution			0
district judge @entity44 was told by prosecutor @entity45 at @entity46 : ‘ this was a sensitive case which was reviewed carefully at the highest level and the area was satisfied both the evidential and public interest criteria had been met			2
‘ however , the principal legal adviser to the @entity53 has taken a different view			0
she is of the view proceedings should n’t be proceeded with			0
’ miss @entity45 added : ‘ from the area ’s point of view we are n’t of the belief there was any error or omission in bringing the prosecution			0
’ no evidence was offered after the case was reopened			0
@entity11 has been cleared after a dramatic last - minute intervention by @entity8 lawyers @entity14 ’s mother , @entity69 , 35 , said she was ‘ disgusted ’ by the decision			1
she said : ‘ this man is a school teacher and it scares me that he could potentially be free to carry on teaching children after what he has done			2
‘ he has abused his position of trust			0
this man is the same age as me and he knew @entity14 was a schoolboy			1
‘ i ’ve not had any contact from the @entity41 about this case and have had to read about this man ’s explicit messages to my son in the press			2
it has been heartbreaking all over again for me , my family and @entity87			0
i ’ve received no victim support and we all just felt sick when we saw what this man was accused of			0
‘ i think the judge should have been left to come to a verdict			0
this is not just about @entity14 , this is to protect other children as well			1
‘ @entity14 was a young man who had only just turned 16 and was just trying to find his sexuality			1
this man has taken advantage of that and was pressuring him with sexually explicit videos and text messages			0
‘ that pressure from this man and others contributed to his death , in my opinion			0
‘ i will do everything in my power to stop him abusing his position again			0
’ following the trial , judge @entity44 had reserved his judgment to take more time to reflect because the case was an ‘ important ’ one which could have ‘ substantial implications ’ for future hearings			0
but yesterday , judge @entity44 told @entity11 : ‘ there ’s no prosecution for me to consider and i find you not guilty			1
’ the teacher of @entity122 , @entity120 declined to comment as he left court			0
a spokesman for the @entity41 in @entity125 said : ‘ we have reconsidered our position on the allegations against @entity11 and informed the court and defence that we no longer believe this prosecution should proceed			1
we offered no evidence against mr @entity11 at the magistrates ’ court			2
’ at the earlier hearing the prosecution alleged the messages were ‘ obscene and indecent ’			2
miss @entity45 said last month : ‘ we are talking about a 33 - year - old primary school teacher sending text messages of such a nature and photographs of his penis and video of another male to a person he knows is a schoolboy			1
he believes him to be 17 but he ’s actually 16			0
’ ‘ the messages themselves are obscene and indecent and , to an extent , that is conceded by the defendant in interview , ’ she added			2
@entity11 denied sending grossly offensive or decent , obscene messages at @entity153 @entity154 , defending @entity11 , previously told the court that the case raised ‘ issues of public concern ’ because the @entity157 was alleging that the sending of salacious texts between two individuals amounted to a criminal act			1
mr @entity154 said : ‘ it ’s a tragic case [ but ] there were no fixed plans for the men to meet			0
a lot of it is effectively fantasy			0
’ @entity11 , who has been suspended by his school , accepted he sent images and a video to @entity14 who , he said , had claimed to be 17			1
but he denied sending grossly offensive or indecent , obscene messages between october 7 and 19 last year			1
@entity14 discovered he was going to be a father when he was 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when @entity25 was born last september			2
he went missing on november 24 last year following an argument with his partner and mother of his child @entity24 , 18 , after she discovered messages on his phone			1
detective sergeant @entity181 , of @entity20 police , said that although @entity14 ’s body was not found until january 14 , he had killed himself in woods near his @entity19 home soon after he vanished.his mobile phone showed he had contacted 14 people through @entity188 , including a 47 - year - old @entity190 man			1
the teenager also spoke to 12 others via the internet video telephone service @entity194			0
he and @entity11 had met on the dating site @entity188			1
the teenager had registered as ‘ young sexy gay ’			0
the pair had been in contact previously on @entity200 and @entity14 sent messages through the course of the ‘ virtual relationship ’ , the court heard			1
miss @entity45 said the subsequent text messages were of an ‘ extremely explicit sexual nature ’			0
but the prosecutor said : ‘ in comparison to the ones sent to mr @entity14 there ’s a marked difference in the content			2
’ @entity11 ’s solicitor said his future employment would be a matter for the @entity217 .			2
