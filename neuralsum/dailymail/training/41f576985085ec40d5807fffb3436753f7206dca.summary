by @entity0 a @entity2 mother is taking legal action against a @entity5 tour operator after her young daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalized during a family holiday at a popular @entity9 resort			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , said her 18 - month - old daughter @entity12 , who has @entity13 , spent almost 48 hours in hospital when her family should have been enjoying a much needed getaway			1
the 42 - year - old mum said she is n’t satisfied with the way @entity19 handled her situation after she and two of her children fell ill at @entity23 on the @entity25 island of @entity26			1
illness affected dozens of guests at @entity23 and a second resort in @entity39 in recent weeks , during the height of the season			1
mother - of - two @entity42 , 32 , of @entity44 , had also recently spoken to @entity45 after her daughter @entity46 fell ill and was hospitalised during a stay at the @entity23			1
mrs @entity10 shared her story after complaining to @entity19			1
speaking of how the hotel allegedly handled the problem , she said : ‘ they ’ve obviously done nothing about it			1
i want it to be known about what ’s going on			0
people need to know what ’s happening at this resort			2
‘ it ’s not a recent thing that ’s happened			0
it ’s been going on for a while and they ’re not doing anything about it			0
’ mrs @entity10 , who provides full - time care for her 18 - month - old daughter , told @entity68 that her family was supposed to spend a full week at the all - inclusive family resort but their getaway was derailed just three days in			1
she believes she and her daughters , @entity12 and four - year - old @entity30 , fell ill after eating food at the resort because it was the only place where had meals and ‘ loads ’ of other guests were also suffering from symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea			1
@entity10 says her daughter was ' severely dehydrated ' when she was admitted to hospital she said : ‘ there were people running past you being sick			1
there were pools of sick all over the floor			0
‘ a little boy ran behind me throwing up and his mum was running behind him trying to catch it			2
the staff were just like , “ yeah , whatever ”			0
they did n’t seem to care			0
‘ it ’s not fair that people are saving to go on holiday and having it ruined by being stuck in hospital and being sick			0
’ she estimated that at least 40 to 50 people were ill , including @entity12 , whose condition deteriorated to the point where she had to be taken to hospital			2
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ it was really severe			1
she was constantly being sick and she could n’t even hold water down			0
’ she claims resort staff would not ring an ambulance			1
she said : ‘ we had to take a taxi to the hospital and they said we had to pay for it ourselves			0
’ @entity113 , a spokeswoman for the resort , said the hospital is a five - to 10 - minute drive from the hotel , it is faster to travel there by taxi and in most cases an ambulance will not be dispatched for stomach - related issues			1
she said a representative from the tour operator normally accompanies an ill guest to hospital and pays for the taxi ride			2
the hotel apologised to the family , she added			1
ruined holiday : @entity132 and @entity10 are n't happy with the way they have been treated in response to recent claims by holidaymakers , @entity23 has released a statement denying suggestions that the illness was caused by poor food hygiene or cleanliness			1
the resort , which has an on - site doctor , said it took precautionary measures to contain a virus that affected 40 to 45 guests			2
those measures included closing the pool and cleaning more frequently			0
the resort 's statement reads : ‘ an investigation highlighted that if the illness was due to food hygiene or cleanliness there would have been a much higher proportion of guests who would have taken ill. ‘ this was a viral bug and whilst the hotel brought in additional hygiene assistance and external medical assistance ( in line with our @entity166 ) , we were informed that this was not a cleanliness or food - hygiene issue			1
’ mrs @entity10 claims that within five minutes of her daughter being admitted to hospital , a ‘ severely dehydrated ’ @entity12 was put on an intravenous drip			1
mrs @entity10 stayed at her daughter ’s bedside while her husband @entity132 , a factory worker , @entity30 and their eight - year - old son @entity29 remained at the hotel			1
she said her husband and kids spent about £ 160 travelling between the resort and hospital , and they were forced to walk at one point because they ran out of money			2
@entity12 was discharged from hospital after two days of treatment but she was n’t her normal self , her mother said			0
‘ she was n’t eating properly			0
to be honest , when we got out we just could n’t wait to come home			0
’ the hospital stay was covered by an insurance policy the family purchased before the trip			2
mrs @entity10 said she contacted @entity19 to get her family on an earlier flight home and was told a plane was leaving in a few hours but they would have to pay for the £ 80 cab ride to the airport			1
because there was a short window to get to the airport , she declined and the family returned on a saturday morning , one day ahead of schedule			2
club @entity207 says it took precautionary measures to contain a virus that affected 40 to 45 guests but before they left they had to continue eating at the resort because they did not have enough money to pay for meals elsewhere			2
mrs @entity10 said she is upset because @entity19 has not offered an apology and has not responded to an official complaint she filed a few weeks after she returned home , although she did speak to an employee in @entity26 and he did not seem surprised			1
‘ he said , “ it ’s just a bug do n’t worry about it ”			0
he said it was worse the week before			0
’ @entity19 released a statement saying it acknowledged receipt of mrs @entity10 ’s email on the day it was sent and advised that it would carry out a thorough investigation and respond within 28 days			1
about three weeks later , @entity19 was contacted by mrs @entity10 ’s solicitor			1
the statement reads : ‘ as this is now within legal proceedings , we can not comment further			0
’ looking back , mrs @entity10 is ‘ quite upset ’ with resort staff who she claims refused to call an ambulance for her ill daughter , who was being treated to her first holiday abroad			1
she said : ‘ they did n’t seem concerned			0
they initially suggested ( she eat ) digestive biscuits			0
what they ’re meant to do , i do n’t know			0
’ after mrs @entity10 returned home , she filed a complaint with the hotel and was offered a £ 600 refund as ‘ a gesture of good will ’ , but she turned it down			1
she said : ‘ i thought that was a bit of an insult after what we had been through			0
it ’s not even about the money it ’s just about the fact that it ’s disgusting how we ’ve been treated			2
’ she admitted she would like to recover the entire cost of the £ 1,600 holiday			0
club @entity264 is one of two @entity9 resorts where travellers have suffered from a vomiting bug recently the family chose the resort after reading positive reviews on @entity273 and getting a recommendation from a travel agent			1
. ’ mrs @entity10 has since contacted compensation firm @entity276 , which has received complaints from dozens of tourists who claim their holidays were ruined by sickness			1
@entity281 , head of travel law at @entity276 , said : ‘ the continuing reports of illness at the @entity23 are a serious concern			2
we have seen a large number of children , often requiring hospital treatment , affected by the outbreak			0
‘ families are continuing to have their hard - earned holidays ruined by illness at the @entity23			2
we have been receiving enquiries since may 2014 and it is vital that action is taken to stop the spread of infection			0
’ she added : ‘ it is of utmost importance that all tour operators and the hotel management take measures to ensure that illness does not continue and to protect the health of all hotel guests			1
’ holidaymakers have also fallen ill at @entity309 on the neighbouring island of @entity39 club @entity264 is one of two @entity9 resorts where travellers have suffered from a vomiting bug			2
the exact number of people who have fallen ill is not clear , but visitors to both resorts believe it is more than 100			2
earlier this week , two separate holidaymakers told @entity68 that up to 80 guests became sick at @entity309 on the neighbouring island of @entity39			0
travellers who were ill are writing about their horror stories and giving the resorts poor reviews on @entity273			1
a user named beffhukgs , from @entity329 , visited @entity23 in july with his or her three young children and described the experience as ‘ very disappointing ’			0
in a review posted thursday , the guest wrote : ‘ our whole party caught a sickness bug and spent half of the holiday in bed			0
‘ which apparently has been doing the rounds in the complex for months			0
’ [ sic ] however , beffhukgs ’ critique was sandwiched between glowing reviews from holidaymakers who did not fall victim to the stomach bug			0
one review was written by a @entity353 mother , who says she plans to return to the resort , and another was posted by a @entity356 resident , who hailed the resort for providing ‘ a memorable customer experience ’ .			0

@entity10 is n't satisfied with the way her family was treated in @entity26
mum *claimsdaughter* was one of many who fell ill at hotel
resort claims *source* of illness was not poor food hygiene or cleanliness
