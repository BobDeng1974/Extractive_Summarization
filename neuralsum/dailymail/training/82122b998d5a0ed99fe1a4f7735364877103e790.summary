@entity0 has rolled out a new pilot program designed to ease passenger congestion in the aisles - and collect more profits - as flights prepare for takeoff			1
under the trial at just a few airports in the @entity10 , you can get onto the plane and in your seat ahead of other passengers regardless of where your row is - as long as you travel light			1
travel expert @entity16 says that after first class passengers are asked to board , the plane is then open to those who are flying without a carry - on bag			1
no bag , no problem : under the trial at just a few @entity10 airports , passengers can get onto the plane ahead of others regardless of their row - as long as they travel without a carry - on tale of the tweet : @entity16 was the first to report the trial after he witnessed it firsthand at an adjacent gate @entity31 , the host of the @entity34 's @entity33 2012 , first reported on the change after he happened to witness the program in action as he waited for a flight at an adjacent gate			1
taking to @entity40 on march 16 , @entity31 posted : ' i wonder if @ @entity42 is testing out a new boarding procedure			0
they just invited those without carry - on 's to board 2nd			2
' less congestion : allowing passengers without carry - ons to board first may lead to less passengers lined up for the overhead bins @entity10 tweeted back : ' we know that the @entity52 airports were trying a new boarding system , @entity54 , but we had n't heard that @entity55 ( @entity56 ) was too			1

he told @entity69 that the unconventional boarding could speed up the process of getting customers on the plane			0
secondly , he said , it may coax customers into skipping the line by checking their bag - and paying the accompanying fee to boost the airline 's profits			2
the airline told @entity69 : @entity0 said , ' we test many different concepts in an effort to continually improve the customer experience			2
' with this in mind , we 're conducting a test for a boarding process whereby customers who do not have any baggage to stow in the overhead compartment will be boarded in a separate group			0
the air carrier added : ' this is a limited test and results are still being analyzed			0
given that it 's a limited test , the airports and flights chosen may change at any time			0

pilot program used at just a handful of @entity10 airports
if *utilized* , the airline will board first - class passengers , followed by those who are without carry - on bags
purses and laptop bags are not *included* as carry - ons in the program
