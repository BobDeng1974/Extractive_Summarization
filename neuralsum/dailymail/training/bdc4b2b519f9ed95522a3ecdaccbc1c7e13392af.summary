by @entity0 if you need the loo , you 'll have to go in the dunes , and if you want a shower you 'll have to walk to the communal shower block , but that does n't stop this modest timber shed being @entity9 's most expensive beach hut			1
with an asking price of £ 270,000 , hut 433 costs £ 5 more than a four - bedroomed detached house in the market town of @entity14 , @entity15 , and the same as a six - bedroom house in @entity17 , @entity18			1
and you can only get to it by boat or on a novelty ' @entity23 ' train , followed by a half - mile hike across the dunes			1
but the estate agents selling the modest hut on @entity28 , near @entity29 in @entity30 , are not anticipating problems finding a buyer			1
' to my knowledge this is the most expensive beach hut in the area , but the reason is because of its position , as well as its high - standard interior and stunnings views			2
' the owners have completely renovated it and everything was made by carpenters so the furniture is almost bespoke			0
you can live in the huts for seven months of the year , and there 's a really nice community down here			0
' the timber - built , 18ft by 12ft hut can sleep up to ten people , with four on a mezzanine deck , four on two sofa beds and two more on a pull - out bed			2
it has hot water for the kitchen and electricity is powered by solar panels on the roof , and a cooker and small fridge run off a camping gas bottle			0
on a £ per square foot basis , the asking price equates to £ 1,250/sq ft - equivalent to homes in @entity100 's @entity99			0
and in addition to the asking price , the new buyer will have to pay £ 4,000 ground rent to @entity105 , and a £ 15,000 transfer fee			0
mr @entity57 said the hut was being sold by a family of five who are selling to buy another hut to do up with a different view on the sandy peninsula			0
the record price paid for a beach hut at @entity28 is £ 170,000 , and one recently went on the market for £ 225,000			2
@entity117 , whose family is selling the hut , relaxes in the mezzanine area in the beach hut 's roof space - his parents plan to buy another hut in the same spot the yellow - painted , timber - built hut lies amongst beautiful dunes on a sandy peninsula near @entity29 , @entity30 , but you 'll have to walk to find a loo room to relax : @entity117 , whose parents own the hut , illustrates the space inside the @entity136 - like building on the @entity28 in @entity30 the current owners have done a complete redecoration , which the estate agents say has contributed to its high price - believed to be the highest for a hut in the area there 's no loo or bathroom but there is hot and cold running water in the kitchen , and a fridge powered by a camping gas bottle ... plus the breathtaking view the owners ' son demonstrates how much room there is once the sofa beds have been tucked away - ten people can fit in the hut , apparently , but it 'll be a squeeze estate agent @entity160 from @entity58 & @entity59 outside the £ 270,000 beach hut on @entity28			1

one - bedroom beach hut on @entity28 near @entity29 in @entity30 is for sale with an asking price of £ 270,000
the modest , timber - built hut has no loo , shower or bath , and can only be *accessed* by boat or ' @entity23 ' land train
even after that , it 's a half - mile hike across the dunes to get there ... but the agents are *confident* @entity179 will sell
@entity57 from @entity58 and @entity59 said : ' it 's the most expensive in the area but the location is second to none '
for the price of the yellow - painted hut , you could have a four - bed detached home in @entity15 market town
