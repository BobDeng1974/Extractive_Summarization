by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 08:52 est , 21 march 2013 apology : @entity4 prime minister @entity3 has apologised for the forced adoptions scandal the @entity4 government has finally apologised for the scandal of the forced adoptions that took place between the 1950s and the 1980s when hundreds of single mothers were made to give up their babies to married couples			1
victims of the controversial programme , which saw newborns taken away before their mothers even had a chance to hold them in their arms , wept and hugged one another as newly re-elected prime minister @entity3 formally said sorry			1
more than 800 children and parents harmed through the programme gathered in @entity24 to hear miss @entity3 tell them that the parliament took responsibility and apologised for the policies and practices that tore mothers from their babies			1
the policy , she said in a powerful , emontionally - charged speech , ‘ created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering			2
’ it was , she told them , ‘ a wound that would not heal			2
’ the crowd applauded as she told the tearful gathering : ‘ we deplore the shameful practices that denied you , the mothers , your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children			1
’ they had not been legally or socially acknowledged as the mothers of children taken from them and as a result were deprived of care and support			1
‘ you were given false assurances , you were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical , dishonest and in many cases illegal			2
‘ sometimes , consent was achieved by forgery or fraud			1
sometimes women signed adoption papers whilst under the influence of medication			2
‘ most common of all was the bullying arrogance of a society that presumed to know what was best			2
‘ the hurt did not simply last for a few days or weeks			1
this was a wound that would not heal			2
’ among the children who were taken were those who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their adoptive parents or institutions			1
touching : @entity4 apologised for the brutal and often illegal forced adoption of tens of thousands of babies born mostly to unmarried mothers between the 1950s and 1970s new chapter : the @entity95 leader 's victory follows months of slipping polls and internal tensions many mothers had been drugged and shackled to their beds in a practice carried out by government officials , hospitals , churches and charities			1
@entity105 , 45 , who had been involved in the campaign to get the @entity4 government to apologise , was herself adopted as a newborn			2
she was reunited with her natural mother 20 years ago after responding to a newspaper phone in			0
in an interview with @entity112 she said : ' i 've personally never liked being adopted			0
i did n't like being special and i was told i was a special child			0
' i remember as a teenager having conversations with mum and she always spoke lovingly about my natural mother she always said she must have loved you very much to give you up			2
' as a young person you do n't really understand how that makes sense because at a subconscious level and as an adult i can articulate that conflict in me but i did n't have the words for it when i was young it came out more in my behaviour			0
' ' but if she loved me so much then why did she give me up ? ' speaking outside the hall following the apology , she said : ' a lot of upset mothers in there lost their children because of demand for babies			1
' people were forced to give their babies up ; they were drugged , they were shackled to their beds ... they did n't relinquish their babies ; their babies were taken			1
' as part of her apology , miss @entity3 announced that $ 5 million ( £ 3.4 million ) would be provided to improve access to specialist support and to help records - tracing and mental health care for those affected by forced adoption			0
in a report released last year , the @entity152 said there had been as many as 150,000 adoptions between 1951 and 1975 , but it was impossible to know how many were forced			0
the seven - member @entity152 committee began investigating the federal government 's role in forced adoption in 2010 after the @entity4 state parliament apologised to mothers and children for the flawed practices in that state from the 1940s until the 1980s			1
@entity4 was the first of five state and territory governments to apologise for forced adoption			0
@entity4 has eight such governments			0
miss @entity170 , head of the @entity171 , set up to help forced - adoption victims , said after the prime minister ’s speech that the apology had been a long time coming			0
‘ i had my baby taken from me in 1969 and i think the use of the term “ forced adoption ” polarises the actual phenomena of what was going on , ’ she said			0
‘ what was going on was kidnapping children , kidnapping newborn babies from their mothers at the birth , using pillows and sheets to cover their face , drugging them as i was drugged , with drugs like sodium pentothal , chloral hydrate and other mind - altering barbiturates			1
‘ it was cruel , it was punitive and then often the mother was transported , like i was , away from the hospital so you had no access to your baby			0
' despite the prime minister ’s apology being mostly welcomed , one woman who identified herself only as ‘ @entity203 ’ said her husband ’s adopted parents were told by a social worker in 1972 that his mother was a 15 - year - old girl who had a boyfriend at school and who was unable to keep her baby			0
but her husband had found out just this week that the mother was in fact 19 - years - old from a farming community and was the victim of a rape			0
when her husband , who had been raised to believe that his parents brought him into the world with love , found out the truth about his background , @entity203 said ‘ he burst out crying ’			0
she added : ‘ his birth mother did n’t know who the birth father was			0
social workers all along had been lying			0
’ breaking with the past : an @entity232 elder performed a traditional welcome before the politician apologised national shame : unwed mothers were pressured , deceived and threatened into giving up their babies @entity239 opposition leader @entity238 said : ‘ i can not imagine a grief greater than that of a parent and a child parted from one another			1
’ the announcement comes just a few weeks after the @entity247 government apologised for @entity248 in which thousands of young women were forcibly placed in catholic - run asylums which were little more than workhouses			1
around 30,000 @entity247 women were sent to the homes , also known as the @entity254 , where physical , sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of nuns and priests who ran them was said to be rife .			1

controversial @entity262 programme ran between the 1950s and 1980s
mothers often had their newborns taken before they had even held them
they were pressured , deceived and threatened to give up their children
some were shackled to beds and drugged before signing consent forms
comes just weeks after @entity247 government apologised for @entity277 homes
