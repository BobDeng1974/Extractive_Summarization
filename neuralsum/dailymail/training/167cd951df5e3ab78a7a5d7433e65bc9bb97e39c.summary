by @entity0 , @entity1 shortbread is not normally a source of sibling tension			2
nor is it an internationally - recognised sign of complacency but , with her son closing in on a historic first @entity11 title , @entity8 's mind was on biscuits			1
' i remember my brother getting this tin of shortbread out at the end of the second set and starting to pass it round , ' said @entity8			1
' my mum 's famous for her shortbread but i was so angry with him because you never relax until the last ball is hit and i felt he thought @entity25 had got it in the bag			1
' no one knew better than @entity8 by july 7 2013 that absolutely nothing should be taken for granted when it came to @entity25 and grand slam finals			1
making history : @entity32 was under huge pressure en route to becoming the first @entity36 man to be crowned @entity11 champion for 77 years twelve months earlier she had watched on from almost the same spot as he took the lead against @entity41 only to lose in four sets and then sob his way through an on - court speech			2
she had also been in @entity45 in september 2012 when @entity25 appeared on course to ease to a first grand slam title as he led @entity48 by two sets to love at the @entity50			1
but back came @entity48 to level the match and , by the time @entity25 finally clinched victory in the fifth set after six minutes short of five hours , all in the @entity32 camp were so emotionally spent that a glorious numbness was all they had left			1
now here was @entity25 again , one set away from becoming the first @entity36 man in 77 years to win one of the holy grails of sport			1
@entity48 took the lead in the third set , as he had in the second , but back roared @entity25 and suddenly he was serving for the match			2
' normally when i watch him i can remember the sequence of the match , the big points and notable things that happened but i ca n't remember anything about that match apart from the final game , ' said @entity8			1
and what a final game it was - 12 minutes of torture			0
hugging it out : but @entity32 almost forgot to thank his mum after securing dramatic @entity11 win ' at 40 - 0 i remember being able to hear my heart beating			2
i thought it was just one good point , one big serve that does n't come back , ' she said			0
' but then it was deuce and @entity48 had a break point			0
i remember @entity48 had a net cord at one point and i swore under my breath			0
' some of his supporters were sitting across the aisle from me , literally no more than arm 's length away			0
' one of them was like a @entity91 @entity90			0
he was getting really noisy and pumping his fist and i was determined not to take any notice because i knew he was just trying to wind me up			0
' the whole thing is an absolute blur			0
i 'm surprised i 'm still alive			0
' having saved three break points , an explosion of noise greeted the moment of victory when @entity48 netted a backhand			0
the new champion himself let out a long yell of delight and pumped his fists , celebrating with the crowd before making the customary climb up to join his supporters			0
he would have missed @entity8 , who was sitting behind the player box , but for the cries of 15,000 people urging him not to forget his mum			2
@entity25 turned back for a brief hug - not that @entity8 minded either way			1
' i was n't bothered at all , ' she said			1
' i was more concerned that he was going to fall through the flimsy roof he was standing on			0
' so proud : @entity8 poses with her superstar son at @entity11 winners ball plenty of accolades have come @entity25 's way since that scorching day in july - @entity123 , an honorary degree and freedom of the city of @entity127 among them - and perhaps a knighthood will follow at some point			1
but for @entity8 it is the effect @entity25 and his brother @entity134 , a @entity11 champion in mixed doubles , have had on children in @entity136 that pleases her most			1
' where i feel it the most is when i go to the tennis club in @entity139 where @entity25 and @entity134 played when they were just little boys who enjoyed the game , ' said @entity8 , who also provides guidance to up - and - coming young players through her role as a head ambassador			1
' it 's just a four - court club in a small town in a country where tennis is very much a minority sport , the facilities are limited and the weather 's terrible			2
' what they 've managed to achieve , when i see all the kids out on the courts , i just think it shows that you never know where they 're going to end up			0
' anything is possible if you have a talent and the opportunity to fulfil it			0

@entity168 's mother was angry when her brother handed her a shortbread biscuit two sets into such a *crucial* match
@entity8 was well aware nothing should be taken for granted when it came to @entity25 and @entity176
@entity25 eventually went on to win 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 and @entity8 says she was n't bothered when @entity25 *initially* forgot to embrace her
