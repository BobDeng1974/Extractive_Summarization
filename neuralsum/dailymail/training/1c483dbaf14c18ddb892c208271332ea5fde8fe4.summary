from their unusual ‘ rippling ’ legs to fiendish fangs , spiders strike terror into many people			2
but arachnophobes may now have another reason to reach for a glass to trap their nemeses because baby spiders - or spiderlings - have been caught on camera ‘ exploding ’ from the back of their mother			1
the bizarre defence mechanism was filmed by @entity18 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , when he captured two three adult spiders in a jar			1
here , you can make out the female beneath the aggressor spider ( bottom ) , while her babies scuttle away after ' jumping ' from her back one spider is shown to scuttle aggressively towards the female before flipping her over and grabbing hold of her			1
as the fight begins , the female appears to eject her babies from her back , showering them across the jar			1
while it may be tempting to think that she has summoned a miniature army to defend her , one expert thinks that the aggressor may have simply torn the sac , which females carry developing spiderlings in on their backs			1
another theory is that the mother was giving her brood the best chance of survival when she was under threat , by releasing them out into the world			1
but it appears it is the spiderlings that have made the ' decision , ' not her			2
dr @entity58 , an expert in behavioural ecology at the @entity60 , told @entity61 that it looks as if the spiderlings jumped off their mother 's backs when she was under threat			1
@entity67 , @entity68 at the @entity69 in @entity70 , told @entity61 : ' what we have is one spider species attacking another , which is always likely if they are put in an enclosed space like this			2
' i can not make out what the attacking species is , other than it is a male – as can be determined by its swollen palps			0
' the smaller and ‘ attacked ’ spider is probably a species of @entity85 ( @entity86 : @entity87 ) and she is carrying her brood on her ‘ back ’			1
' this is typical behaviour of the family @entity87 , the females carry their egg cocoons around with them and when they hatch , the young spiderlings crawl onto her abdomen where they are afforded protection and maternal care – including a share of her food			1
' it all goes wrong though if she is attacked by a predator herself , in which case they simply disperse as in this video – they are probably old enough to fend for themselves providing they were released			0
' in the animal world most mothers will stoically attempt to protect their offspring from attack			0
however in most species their own survival instinct ultimately overrules the maternal instinct and their own survival becomes paramount			0
' one spider is shown to scuttle aggressively towards the female before seemingly grabbing hold of her ( pictured bottom )			1
it is not clear whether the larger spider tears the female 's egg sac , whether she deliberately unleashes the tiny spiders in defence , or if , as one expert suggests , the spiderlings escape voluntarily some spiders are better mothers than others			1
female wolf spiders carry their spiderlings on their backs ( pictured ) when they have hatched and are among very few species of spiders to do this an army of green - fanged cannibal spiders is invading @entity138 - eating smaller arachnids as they set up nests in homes across the country			1
the eight - legged creatures are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the @entity138 - and their bite is like a bee sting			1
their thick black bodies range from between 1.5cm to 2.2cm wide , their fangs shine menacingly green , and they are known to eat their own mothers			0
@entity152 first spotted the eight - legged beast when he was outside his friend 's house in @entity156 , @entity157			1
mr @entity152 , 41 from @entity158 , said : ' i spotted this one on the wall and shined a light on to it and could see its fangs			0
' it was devouring another smaller spider – they 're proper little cannibals			0
' we tried to feed it a woodlouse but it was n't interested			0
' they only seemed to want to eat smaller ones , i guess they must be easier prey			0
' a vet confirmed that one of the spiders , which had been captured , was a tube spider			1
a few species of spiders allow their offspring to ride on their backs while they are small			0
this gives them a better chance of not being eaten			0
' the agressor spider flips the mother over			1
perhaps the spiderlings recognise a chance in orientation and that 's when the jump off , ' dr @entity188 said			2
@entity194 , arachnid expert at @entity195 agrees			0
' as the footage is so blurry it does give the impression that she explodes , but of course she is just carrying her brood on her abdomen as do many species of “ nomadic ” spiders , such as wolf spiders for instance			0
' when she is attacked they simply jump off & run for cover			0
' other inverts that carry their young on their backs include scorpions			0
' an invertebrate keeper at @entity215 added : ' the babies scattering is their best chance of survival - not likely to be causing a distraction or an attack			1
maternal care methods vary greatly in the world of spiders			0
' mr @entity18 said he had ‘ no idea ’ that when he trapped the spiders , one of them was carrying babies on her back			1
‘ so i 'm glad i caught it and fed it to the other before i had 20 - 30 spiders disperse in my home			2
i would love to know what type of spiders these two are , ’ he told @entity231			0
if the spider was using a defense mechanism in a bid to ward off her attacker , her ‘ explosion ’ of babies is not the only strange defence mechanism unleashed in the natural world			2
the hairy frog - also known as the horror frog - breaks its own tow bones when under threat so they stick out through its skin and act as claws			2
likewise , the @entity256 ribbed newt pushes its own rib bones through its skin , before secreting poison through the holes created			0
insects such as the @entity262 ant have poisonous glands which explode when they are threatened , shooting the deadly liquid towards aggressors			0
the potato beetle eats poisonous plants to cover itself in toxic faeces , while cereal leaf beetles encase their poo in a jelly sac , which they carry on their back as protection			2
many creatures have usual defence mechanisms including the cereal leaf beetle ( pictured ) which encases its poisonous poo in a jelly sac , which it then carries on its back as protection against being eaten			2

the spider attack was filmed in by @entity285 in @entity19 , @entity20
film shows three spiders under a *tupperware* *box* - one is *visibly* *pregnant*
as one spider attacks the mother , babies are seen ' jumping ' from her back
@entity297 spider may have torn the female 's egg sac , or the spiderlings may have jumped off when they *sensed* a threat , claims experts
