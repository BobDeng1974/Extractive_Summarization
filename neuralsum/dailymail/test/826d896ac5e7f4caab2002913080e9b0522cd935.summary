boss @entity0 insists @entity2 have no margin for error in their relegation fight as they aim to close the gap to safety			1
the foxes go to @entity9 on saturday bottom of the @entity11 and six points adrift from the survival line			1
a 2 - 1 win over @entity15 last weekend gave them a first victory in nine league games and ended a run of just two points from a possible 24			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 ( fourth right ) talks to his squad during a training session @entity0 watches on at the @entity8 training ground as he plans their route to @entity11 survival but with eight games left @entity0 knows that they can not afford any further slip ups			1
' our form has to take that upward trend in terms of results			0
we do n't really have a buffer to fall back on , we have to perform here on in , ' he said at his pre-match press conference			0
' the players have dealt with an awful lot of disappointment but strived to get the performances			0
that has been the case for the majority of the season			0
what we have to do now is change those performances into wins			0
' people tell me about other people 's run - ins but you will survive or not due to your own results			1
' we have to keep it in our hands for as long as possible and we need to win more games			2
that 's the reality of the situation but we 're capable of it			2
' @entity2 still have to play relegation rivals @entity64 and @entity65 and host @entity66 on the final day , giving @entity0 hope			1
he said : ' we have to play a lot of sides around us			0
it 's nice to have games where we can directly affect their end to the season but the flip side is they will see it the same way			1
' it depends how those fixtures go , you win those and the picture changes			0
what we have to do is manage the swings in mood which will be in the public domain			0
' you win a game or lose a game and there 's a shift in terms of how people perceive it			2
' @entity93 ( centre ) is back in contention for the game with @entity9 after returning from injury @entity98 ( centre ) is also back in training with @entity2 following a calf problem @entity93 ( @entity102 ) and @entity98 ( calf ) are back in training and are available for the trip to @entity105 , where @entity0 spent time as coach between 2004 and 2006			1
the @entity9 are holding @entity107 to honour their former striker and raise awareness for the @entity110			2
former @entity9 striker @entity111 died in 2002 aged 59 from a brain condition normally linked to boxing after heading heavy leather footballs during his career			2
and while @entity0 believes it is a fine cause he insisted the foxes can not get caught up in the day			1
he said : ' in many ways it 's for recognition for an outstanding player and person who has achieved an awful lot for the football club			0
' it 's great @entity9 have decided to make an occasion to celebrate @entity111 's contribution and raise awareness of these types of head injury issues			1
' but for us , unfortunately , we have to recognise we are part of the day but our own plight is the most important thing			0
' what we ca n't do is get carried away in the occasion			0

@entity2 travel to @entity9 in @entity11 on saturday
@entity0 's side have eight games to save *top* - flight status
