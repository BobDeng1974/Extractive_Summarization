mr @entity27 , 36 , said : ‘ i ’d just uploaded some pictures to my website and had gone for a lie down on the beach when i heard a bit of a commotion			0
‘ i looked up and at first thought they were flies but they realised they were either wasps or bees			0
experienced beekeeper @entity49 was called to assist lifeguards in collecting the insects mr @entity49 from nearby village @entity52 , swept the queen bee into a beekeepers box and waited for the swarm it took about four hours for the whole swarm of bees to migrate into the box ‘ it was a bit frightening , they were about two feet above my head and were settling on the tent which was right next to us			1
i pretty much crawled out of there and then ran			0

' the queen must have been in the box as when i returned a few hours later all the bees had gone in - they would have followed her scent			2
