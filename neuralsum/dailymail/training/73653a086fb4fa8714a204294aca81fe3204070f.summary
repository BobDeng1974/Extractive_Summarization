up to 100 people are still being slaughtered each day in @entity5 as the @entity4 regime hits back against opposition forces , who have ended the dictator 's dominance in key parts of the country			2

ongoing conflict : 100 people are being killed in @entity5 each day as the @entity4 regime attempts to crack down on opposition forces constant danger : an unexploded mortar shell , from clashes between @entity5 rebel fighters and government forces , is seen near @entity79 district in @entity80 @entity82 clashes : a man inspects a burning shop on a road covered in debris in the @entity88 district in @entity80 yesterday mr @entity10 said : ' what was in the communique was that a transitional government in @entity5 should include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups , and be formed on the basis of mutual consent , mutual assent , which means that each side can veto , if they wish , the people from the other side , who would be in a government			2
' of course , that would mean that president @entity4 could not be part of such a government			2

something which puts the @entity40 plan and the @entity59 plan under @entity12 and international law would be a very good thing			0
' there is much that you can do under @entity150 41 , which specifically rules out the use of force , but which allows coercive non-military measures such as economic sanctions , travel bans and that sort of thing			0
