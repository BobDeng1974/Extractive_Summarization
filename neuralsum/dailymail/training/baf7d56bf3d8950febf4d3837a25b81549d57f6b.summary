they told @entity24 of the @entity25 that living in a small town and always ' getting nasty comments ' prepared them somewhat for the abuse they now receive both in person and online			2

none of these groups would have the rights they do if they had n't fought to change negative stereotypes and perceptions			2

' they have also been told by others how helpful their story has been with regards to their own lives			0
@entity8 said : ' so many people have told me i 've inspired them and loads of people have come to me for advice , including parents of young children			1
' @entity8 , right , says she ca n't go out alone as she is often followed or shouted at by people in passing cars			1
internet trolls plague her , too , and she has started taking antidepressants @entity66 and @entity67 , both of whom are students , say they ca n't remember life before wishing they were of the opposite gender			1
going through puberty proved nightmarish for them both			0

i literally hate my pasts and tried to cut them off as a teenager			0
but with surgery hopefully happening within the next 12 months , that will change			0
' the couple , who have n't spent a day apart since they met almost a year ago , and got engaged in march , plan not to be intimate with one another before they have had their operations			2
@entity88 said : ' it 's hard to be intimate yet because we are not yet comfortable with our bodies			2
