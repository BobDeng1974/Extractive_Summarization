by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 10:30 est , 26 june 2013 a hungry police officer parked his patrol car on double yellow lines in a cycle lane - so he could buy a pork bun			2
the armed officer pulled over in the narrow road near @entity9 's @entity8 in his @entity10 and left his car parked illegally before queuing to buy a sandwich at a cafe under the railway arches nearby			1
the officer , who wore body armour and had his gun clearly strapped to his leg as he waited in line , is thought to have ordered a bbq pulled pork bap			2
dressed in body armour and with his gun clearly visible , the policeman left his car illegally parked to buy a pork bun the marked police @entity24 was left on double yellow lines and in a cycle lane while the officer bought his lunch the incident took place yesterday lunchtime at @entity31 just south of the @entity32 in @entity9 , a city where 4million parking fines are handed out each year			1
@entity34 , an office worker in @entity35 , captured the armed officer ’s brazen behaviour after he saw the car parked illegally and assumed an urgent police operation was taking place nearby			1
he said : ' upon seeing a @entity42 slowly parking up on both a cycle lane and double yellow lines , i thought there must be some sort of incident to which the officers inside were attending			0
this picture shows the narrow street with double yellow lines and cycle lane where the policeman left his car ' i stopped briefly just to see if anything was going down , but one of the officers casually hopped out smiling and proceeded to walk into @entity8			1
' i thought he might be responding to something involving one of the market stalls , but was shocked to see him simply saunter up to buy his lunch			0
' as someone who ’s had to fork out £ 65 for a parking fine in @entity9 when i was just a few minutes over the time , i think it displays shocking double standards that the police can get away with this sort of thing			0
' the @entity72 stall which the police officer visited is a popular haunt in the food - lovers ' market			0
set up by former market trader @entity77 and his wife @entity78 , it offers hot meat rolls , buns and baguettes , with popular items including a pulled pork bun and a beef sandwich wrap .			0
