some of @entity1 ’s most significant landmarks are under threat from climate change , and could be fundamentally damaged in the near future , according to a new study			1
sites as celebrated as the @entity7 in @entity8 and @entity9 in @entity10 are among the places identified as being in danger from unpredictable weather patterns			1
great icons , but for how long ? the @entity7 and @entity9 are at risk from rising waters the survey , ‘ @entity18 ’ , has been conducted by @entity20 - based research group the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
it lists 30 ' endangered ' historic attractions in 15 @entity1 different states			1
the 30 locations have been included because , according to the report ’s authors , ‘ the science behind the risks they face is robust , and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts affecting the @entity1 ’ cultural heritage			1
’ @entity8 's most famous monument , the @entity7 , is , the study suggests , under threat from rising sea levels			1
the report points to the example of @entity41 , which , in 2012 , caused @entity43 ( where the @entity7 stands ) to be swamped with water – resulting in considerable damage and the closing of the site for several months			0
at the sea 's edge : @entity9 's location so near to the @entity52 could be a source of problems the report worries that @entity41 was not an isolated incident , but the start of a trend			0
‘ there is evidence that @entity41 gained strength from unusually warm upper - ocean temperatures in the @entity52 , ’ it states			1
‘ these temperatures are expected to continue rising with global warming			1
’ the @entity9 , at @entity66 on the east coast of @entity10 , is also deemed to be in the path of troublesome tides			2
‘ the launch pad is very close to the ocean and is vulnerable to the dangers of rapidly rising seas and storm surge , ’ the survey argues			1
the same situation could spark problems a little to the north on @entity10 ’s @entity52 flank – where @entity80 is @entity1 ’s oldest city , dating back to @entity83 settlement in 1565			2
a slice of @entity83 heritage : the @entity86 in @entity80 is under threat from rising sea levels here , the @entity86 , a 17th century fort , perches right on the waterline			0
@entity90 : @entity91 and @entity92 ; @entity93 and @entity94 : @entity95 ; @entity96 ; @entity97 : @entity98 : @entity86 and @entity80 's historic downtown ; prehistoric shell structures at ten @entity101 and @entity102 ; @entity97 @entity9 in @entity103 : @entity104 and @entity105 o @entity106 : @entity107 : @entity108 ; @entity109 and @entity110 : @entity112 's @entity111 and the @entity113 : @entity114 : @entity115 and @entity117 @entity116 : @entity7 and @entity118 : @entity119 : @entity121 's @entity120 : @entity122 : @entity123 ; @entity124 ; @entity125 and @entity126 ‘ sea - level rise could significantly compromise the future of @entity80 ’s unique cultural heritage , ’ the report warns			1
‘ for example , a rise of three feet – which is well within current projections – could permanently inundate portions of the city ’s historic districts			0
’ elsewhere in the south - east of the country , @entity138 ’s heritage could face similar difficulties – not least @entity121			0
founded in 1670 , and situated on the edge of the ocean , the city is home to numerous historic structures of irreplaceable value			0
the report advises that ‘ the city ’s longtime struggle with flooding is expected to worsen over the coming decades as global warming continues to increase the pace of sea level rise , and causes the heaviest rainfall events to dump more water than in decades past			1
’ and the danger from climate change is not restricted to the eastern seaboard , according to the authors of the study			0
the high terrain of @entity162 may be immune to sea surges – but other factors could reputedly wreak havoc in the mountainous state			2
for example , @entity167 – a hotspot of indigenous heritage near @entity170 , where a cluster of cliff dwellings dates back 4500 years – is at risk from wild fires			0
two such blazes caused enormous damage in 2000 , destroying 52,000 acres of the national park – and the likelihood of further conflagrations is considered high			0
@entity121 has been a fixture in @entity138 since 1670 - but its coastal location is a cause for concern ‘ for the past 50 years , ’ the report says , ‘ the temperatures in the @entity98 area have been rising , particularly during the summer , at a much faster rate than they did over the preceding century			2
‘ in the @entity192 overall , it has been warmer since 1950 than any period of comparable length in at least 600 years			0
‘ rising temperatures add to the region ’s natural wildfire risk and increase the likelihood that when fires do occur , they will be larger and even more devastating			0
’ and even remote @entity90 is not out of the reach of damaging weather patterns			2
on fire : the structures at @entity167 date back 4500 years - but fire damaged the area in 2000 @entity91 – where archaeological sites pinned to the history of the @entity210 , the @entity211 , date back over 4,000 years – is singled out as a cause for concern due to the fragmentation of this pristine section of shoreline			2
‘ coastal erosion is washing away irreplaceable archaeological artefacts at particularly vulnerable coastal locations , ’ the report posits .			0
