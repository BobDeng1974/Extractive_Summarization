by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 12:00 est , 30 october 2012 for most patients the @entity1 is their first port of call when they fall ill. but a survey has revealed one in three think their local doctors are now so busy that they could be misdiagnosed			1
the poll suggests these fears are well - placed with a quarter saying they had been wrongly diagnosed or knew someone who had been over the past five years			2
however , only 56 per cent of those currently registered with a @entity1 said they would be confident enough to challenge their doctor if they thought they were wrong			1
unconvinced by the diagnosis ? nearly half of those surveyed said they would n't challenge their gp if they thought they were wrong young adults were surprisingly even less likely to challenge their gp , with 64 per cent of 18 to 24 year - olds saying they would n't feel confident enough to speak up			1
' we â€™re all aware that gps are under pressure ; they are often overstretched and despite the level of skill that exists in this field , probably only have the capacity retain around 200 conditions and diseases in their memory out of the many thousands that exist , said @entity32 , founder of @entity33 , which commissioned the survey of more than 2,000 adults			0
' this research suggests that there is a need to support and better equip both gps and patients to help achieve a quicker and more accurate diagnosis through more effective communication and collaboration			1
' the average @entity1 consultation in @entity46 lasts just seven minutes , so to save time doctors advise patients to try get to the point quickly and be truthful - however embarrassing this may feel			1
they also suggest you do some research at home but to arrive with a one - page summary of your findings rather than reams of information			0
to this end @entity33 has developed an online symptom checker that allows patients to research possible diagnoses based on their symptoms			1
@entity33 claim their symptom checker is 95 per cent accurate compared to 50 per cent for ' dr @entity64 ' the designers say the checker works by searching a database of 6,000 diseases and is far more accurate than @entity64 in predicting an illness			0
so searching for the symptoms - ' itchiness ' , ' back ache ' and ' red rash ' suggests drug allergy , contact dermatitis and @entity77			0
clicking on the condition takes you to other online sources with extra information , helping you to eliminate unlikely causes			2
sir @entity83 , president of the @entity84 and former president of the @entity86 , said : ' during my time as president of the @entity86 , i saw many cases of unfortunate diagnostic error			0
' with so many conditions and diseases that can be easily missed when assessing patients , there is a critical need for modern technology such as the @entity97 to help patients better understand the possible diagnoses that could be causing their symptoms and work in collaboration with their gps			2
' you can view the symptom checker at @entity104			0

just half of patients said they would challenge @entity1 if they thought they were wrong
