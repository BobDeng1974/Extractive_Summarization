an extraordinary email exchange demonstrates the efforts made by former @entity4 owners @entity2 in trying to prove two well - known club officials committed gross misconduct			1
the messages , leaked to @entity8 , implicate @entity2 chief @entity9 and colleague @entity10 , a @entity4 director , in attempting to find enough evidence against @entity12 and @entity13 to prevent them from getting a pay - off			1
@entity12 , now chief executive of the @entity16 , had his contract honoured in full when he left @entity4 , but former technical director @entity13 started his £ 250,000 case for unfair dismissal this week			1
former @entity4 owners @entity2 sought to gather evidence that two officials committed gross misconduct @entity13 was dismissed for using a club email account to send a ‘ lewd and obscene ’ picture to former @entity4 colleague @entity26			1
the picture of a naked woman in a shower was part of a ‘ dirty @entity4 ’ joke email doing the rounds			2
@entity9 wrote to a @entity2 employee at @entity4 on july 23 , 2013 : ‘ i believe we should continue to find ways to dismiss @entity12 and @entity13 for gross misconduct			1
we should also let the investigation firm find more information on them so we can use it against them			0
’ @entity10 emailed a @entity4 colleague on the same day , writing : ‘ as per @entity9 instruction , please can you provide a list of breaches of @entity44 and @entity12			1
’ @entity10 to @entity9 : ‘ we talked through the items we have but still need specific proof for @entity12 and @entity13			1
’ @entity10 ( above ) was involved in email exchanges with @entity2 chief @entity9 seen by @entity8 again from @entity10 to @entity9 : ‘ even still , we need to pay them as regular until we have something concrete which can prove gross misconduct			1
by not paying , we trigger a process which can be very damaging to the club			2
’ another email between the @entity2 pair read : ‘ @entity13 — we should pay him tomorrow otherwise we leave ourselves open for constructive dismissal and breach of contract			1
before next pay date we need to find strong evidence of gross misconduct , otherwise we have to pay him as per redundancy process			2
‘ @entity12 — we should pay him tomorrow			2
however if we can prove gross misconduct , we may be able to claw back some of the change of control provision			0
suggest investigating all his bank accounts to see if he was receiving bribes			0
’ @entity12 declined to comment , as did @entity2			1
former @entity4 ceo @entity12 was one of the officials , along with @entity71 wanted to sack @entity72 , impressed with the way @entity75 cover rugby , are intending to borrow their pundits @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity79 for this year ’s @entity80			1
there are now more than five billion reasons why @entity84 clubs have moved on from the sexist email exchanges last may between chief executive @entity86 and @entity88 lawyer @entity87			1
the tv rights package structure that proved so astonishingly lucrative was mainly devised by @entity86 and @entity90			0
@entity86 secured a £ 5bn tv deal after selling @entity84 's domestic rights to @entity93 and @entity75 @entity95 owner @entity94 is a wealthy concert promoter			0
yet even the most generous estimate of @entity99 ’s salary as the rugby league club ’s new chief executive means the former @entity103 boss has taken a two - thirds pay - cut on his old £ 640,000 annual package			2
@entity75 ramp up @entity93 feud the latest division of @entity84 rights between @entity93 and @entity75 has done nothing to improve relations between the warring pay - tv networks			0
@entity75 believe their bidding tactics resulted in @entity93 paying hugely over the odds for five packages , while @entity75 got their 42 games for a sensible price			0
@entity93 claim @entity75 put massive money on the table for the main packages but were outmanoeuvred in the second round			0
certainly the importance both sides attached to the match - pick categories — including second and third choices — in the new contract only emphasises that @entity75 ’s current deal allows @entity93 to dominate the selection of games to a far greater extent than @entity75 imagined when their @entity84 coverage started			2
the @entity84 will continue to be shown on @entity132 and @entity75 until 2019 in a £ 5.136bn deal graphic charts the significant rise of domestic @entity84 tv revenue @entity137 , the @entity138 director of @entity140 ’s ticket and hospitality partners match who was arrested on suspicion of ticket touting during the @entity80 , has been cleared seven months later			0
@entity137 was held in @entity145 ’s notorious @entity144 prison and labelled a fugitive			0
a @entity148 court ruled there were insufficient grounds to prosecute			0
police had ‘ erred ’ in collecting evidence and worked ‘ in haste ’ .			0

@entity2 chief @entity9 and colleague @entity10 actively sought evidence against @entity12 and @entity13
@entity12 had his contract honoured in full when he left the club
@entity13 was dismissed for using work email to send ' lewd ' picture
email exchanges reveal the @entity2 pair *plotted* to sack @entity12 and @entity13
