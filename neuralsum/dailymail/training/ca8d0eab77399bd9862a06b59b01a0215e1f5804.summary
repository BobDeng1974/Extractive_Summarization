by @entity1 reporter published : 09:50 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 21 october 2013 the last piece of legislation president @entity4 signed - aiming to transform the way people with mental health problems were cared for - turns 50 this month			1
but the dream behind the @entity9 - to build 1,500 centres , halving the number of those living in state mental hospitals - was never realised			1
signed on october 31 , 1963 , weeks before @entity4 was assassinated , the legislation aimed to build mental health centres accessible to all @entity16 so that those with mental illnesses could be treated while working and living at home , rather than being kept in neglectful and often abusive state institutions , sometimes for years on end			1
president @entity4 signs a bill authorizing $ 329 million for mental health programs at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
the @entity9 , the last legislation that @entity4 signed , aimed to build 1,500 mental health centres @entity4 said when he signed the bill that the legislation to build 1,500 centres would mean the population of those living in state mental hospitals — at that time more than 500,000 people — could be cut in half			1
the legislation did help to usher in positive life - altering changes for people with serious illnesses such as schizophrenia , many of whom now live normal , productive lives with jobs and families			2
in 1963 , the average stay in a state institution for someone with schizophrenia was 11 years			2
but only half of the proposed centres were ever built , and those were never fully funded			1
meanwhile , about 90 percent of beds have been cut at state hospitals , according to @entity55 , a @entity56 psychiatry professor and expert in how the law affects the practice of medicine			1
in many cases , several mental health experts said , that has left nowhere for the sickest people to turn , so they end up homeless , abusing substances or in prison , the @entity61 reports			1
in a special message to @entity70 earlier that year , he said the idea was to successfully and quickly treat patients in their own communities and then return them to ' a useful place in society			2
' recent deadly mass shootings , including at the @entity77 and a @entity79 movie theatre , have been perpetrated by men who were apparently not being adequately treated for serious mental illnesses			1
but only half of the proposed centres were ever built , and those were never fully funded those tragedies have focused public attention on the mental health system and made clear that @entity4 ’s vision was never fully realised			1
the three largest mental health providers in the nation today are jails : @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 in @entity94			1
' the rhetoric was very highfalutin			2
the reality was a little more complicated , and the funds that were provided were not adequate to the task , ' said @entity99 , president and ceo of @entity101 , a nonprofit behavioral health organisation in @entity103			2
' the goals of deinstitutionalization were perverted			0
people who did need institutional care got thrown out , and there were n’t the programs in place to keep them supported , ' said former @entity16 rep. @entity112 , the president ’s nephew			0
' we do n’t have an alternate policy to address the needs of the severely mentally ill. ' he is gathering advocates in @entity119 this week for the @entity120 , a meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of his uncle ’s legislation and an attempt to come up with an agenda for improving mental health care			1
the 1963 legislation came amid other changes in treatments for the mentally ill and health care policy in general , @entity55 said			0
@entity133 or @entity133 , the first effective antipsychotic medicine , was released in the 1950s			0
that allowed many people who were mentally ill to leave institutions and live at home			0
in 1965 , with the adoption of @entity141 , the government program that provided health care coverage for the poor , deinstitutionalization accelerated , experts said , because states now had an incentive to move patients out of state hospitals , where they shouldered the entire cost of their care , and into communities where the federal government would pick up part of the tab			1
later , a movement grew to guarantee rights to people with mental illness			1
laws were changed in every state to limit involuntary hospitalisation so people ca n’t be committed without their consent , unless there is a danger of hurting themselves or others			0
@entity4 ’s legislation provided for $ 329 million to build mental health centers that were supposed to provide services to people who had formerly been in institutions , as well as to reach into communities to try to prevent the occurrence of new mental disorders			1
had the act been fully implemented , there would have been a single place in every community for people to go for mental health services			1
but one problem with the legislation was that it did n’t provide money to operate the centers long - term			0
' having gotten them off the ground , the federal government left it to states and localities to support , ' @entity55 said			0
' that support by and large never came through			0
' later , during the @entity196 administration , the remaining funding for the act was converted into a mental health block grant for states , allowing them to spend it however they chose			1
@entity55 called it a death knell because it left the community health centers that did exist on their own for funding			0
@entity208 , a professor of psychiatry and community and family medicine at @entity212 , said some states have tried to provide good community mental health care			2
' but it ’s been very hard for them to sustain that because when state budget crunches come , it ’s always easiest to defund mental health programs because the state legislature gets relatively little pushback , ' he said			2
the three largest mental health providers in the nation today are jails : @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 in @entity94 ( pictured ) ' services are at a very low level right now			2
it ’s really kind of a disaster situation in most states			0
' @entity99 points out that most mentally ill people are at a very low risk of becoming violent			0
he said it ’s unthinkable we would go back to the era when people were housed in ' nightmare ' conditions at overcrowded , understaffed and sometimes dangerous state hospitals			2
' the opportunity to recover is much greater now than it was in 1963 , ' he said			0
but for those who do not take their medication , do n’t recover from their first episode of illness and do n’t seek treatment and support from professionals , they are vulnerable to homelessness , incarceration and death , he said			0
@entity252 , president and ceo of the @entity254 for @entity255 , counts among its 2,100 member organizations many of the original community mental health centers that were built under the 1963 legislation			1
' whenever you pass a piece of legislation , people would like to think that you ’ve solved the problem , ' she said			0
' it did some very important things			0
it laid some ground work			0
it ’s up to us now to move forward			0

@entity9 was *designed* to build 1,500 centres
the aim was to halve the number in mental hospitals
