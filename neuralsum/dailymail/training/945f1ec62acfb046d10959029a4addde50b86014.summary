very few ancient crafts are beyond the power of modern science - almost every single one has been bettered by industrial processes			2
the painstaking process of creating a samurai sword - reforged hundreds of times by hand - is one			2
another - until now - has been the @entity10 violin			1
scientists puzzle over why the 650 stradivarius violins still in existence sound so good - but after two years of ct scanning , and computer - aided carving , scientists have ' recreated ' one for the first time			1
a precise replica of a @entity10 violin from 1704 , made using x-ray images ' @entity23 ' tests have shown that @entity24 are not always the best violins in existence - but their consistently high sound quality still baffles experts			1
some believe it 's due to unique woods used by @entity32 , or to shaping or wood thickness in particular parts of the instruments - others believe that its due to chemical processes used to treat them			2
the original violin - normally stored in the @entity40 - next to the replica , carved using computer - controlled equipment from ct scans of the original @entity45 equipment carves ultra-precise models using @entity48 ' scans ' - and can produce a near - perfect replica based on scans of an original object			1
even so , the replica was finished by hand a new study by the @entity55 might help unravel the mystery of the violins - without destroying the precious instruments in the process			1
most @entity60 are stored in museums , and are never played			0
this summer , one of the instruments sold at auction for $ 15.9 million			0
the team from the @entity55 used advanced computer x-ray tomography imaging to create a @entity48 ' scan ' of the violin - both inside and out			1
the @entity45 equipment worked from a 3d model created from 1,000 x-rays to replicate every nook and cranny of the instrument the 1704 violin was then reconstructed using computer - aided machine tools			1
' @entity75 offers a unique method of imaging a historical object - in a non-invasive way ' said @entity79 , @entity80 , a radiologist at @entity81			2
' combined with computer - aided machinery , it also offers us the opportunity to create a reproduction with a high degree of accuracy			2
' @entity32 , an @entity89 who lived from 1644 to 1737 , is regarded as history 's greatest violin maker			2
of the estimated 1,000 violins @entity32 made , about 650 still exist and are highly prized for their unique sound quality			1
there are many theories but no simple explanation for the superiority of the @entity10			0
some believe it 's simply the wood @entity32 used			0
many factors influence a violin 's sound - from the qualities of the wood to the instrument 's shape , degree of arching and wood thickness			1
to create a violin with the same characteristics as the 1704 instrument known as ' @entity116 ' dr. @entity79 worked with professional violin makers @entity117 and @entity119 of @entity120 , @entity121			2
' we have two goals : to understand how the violin works and to make reproductions of the world 's most prized violins available for young musicians who ca n't afford an original , ' dr. @entity79 said			1
the original violin was scanned with a 64 - detector @entity75 , and more than 1,000 ct images were converted into 3d image files , which can be read by a computer - controlled tool called a cnc machine - a carving device controlled by computer code			1
the cnc machine , custom - made for the project by @entity119 , then carved the back and front plates and scroll of the violin from various woods			1
finally , @entity117 and @entity119 finished , assembled and varnished the replica by hand			0
' we believe this process of recreating old and valuable stringed instruments may have a profound influence upon modern string musicians , ' dr. @entity79 said			0
one of the x-ray scans used to recreate ' @entity152 '			2
in total , 1,000 images were used the @entity155 is held in the @entity156 @entity40			1
dr. @entity79 , an amateur violinist , first scanned a violin with @entity75 out of curiosity			0
' i assumed the instrument was merely a wooden shell surrounding air , ' he said			0
' i was totally wrong			0
there was a lot of anatomy inside the violin			0
' this revelation may help not only to build cheap reconstructions of the violins - but help design new generations of instruments			1
after he shared those first @entity75 images with @entity174 in 1989 , the two spent years scanning more than 100 violins — including 29 valuable instruments pre-dating 1827 — and other stringed instruments to better understand their composition			1
' just like human beings , there is a wide range of normal variation among violins , ' dr. @entity79 said			0
' when you are looking at an instrument that is hundreds of years old , you will see worm holes and cracks that have been repaired			0
' there is also damage from being exposed to all kinds of conditions , from floods to wars			0
' for owners of authentic stradivarius or other prized violins , @entity75 imaging not only provides a definitive form of identification , it helps establish a pedigree that may increase the value of their investment			0
most are collectors items , sold at auction for huge sums , or stored in museums			0
dr @entity79 's process may also help preserve the remaining @entity24			1
' @entity75 is useful in measuring wood density , size and shapes , thickness graduation and volume measurements , ' dr. @entity79 said			0
' it also provides detailed analysis of damage and repair			0

@entity220 could pave way for cheap reproductions
1,000 x-ray images used to build a @entity48 ' model ' of violin
will help spot ' fake ' @entity24
could help construct new , better - sounding violins
