an hour delay seems like nothing compared to a wait of more than two - and - a - half years for a @entity4 league goal – but it was the forgotten @entity5 who passed his @entity8 screen test on a day where everything threatened to go wrong for @entity11			1
the game was in serious doubt when the canvas surrounding the club ’s new giant screen – making its debut – became dislodged by high winds at 1pm			2
it took two hours to resolve the issue and , with thousands of supporters held at the turnstiles amid safety concerns , kick - off was delayed to 4pm			2
@entity4 scored the winner for @entity26 as they beat @entity27 1 - 0 at @entity8 @entity26 : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ( @entity33 72 ) , @entity34 ( @entity35 59 ) , @entity36 , @entity4 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 90 ) , @entity40			1

@entity27 : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 56 ) , @entity54			0
subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59			0

att : 51,886 ref : @entity60 ( @entity61 )			0
but that was n’t before influential midfielder @entity63 hobbled from the warm - up in obvious discomfort and declared himself unfit to play			0
at this point , @entity11 could have been forgiven for wishing for another gust to come along and postpone the fixture			1
come full - time , though , the @entity26 boss was puffing his cheeks in relief at a first league win , avoiding the ignominy of a club record of eight games without victory from the start of a @entity79 season			1
the identity of his match - winner was equally satisfying			2
@entity4 – a player signed on the say - so of @entity11 – had become a figure of fun on @entity85 after three ineffective seasons			1
but it was the 25 - year - old who had the last laugh as his 71st - minute strike – his first since february , 2012 – settled the contest and gave his manager a much - needed three points			0
@entity11 ’s team had started well			1
with an extra hour of ale inside them , the home fans were right behind their side from the off with no hint of any protest against the boss or regime , despite the earlier farce			1
and @entity26 should have been two up inside 10 minutes			1
first @entity37 whipped enticingly through the six - yard area but there were no takers			0
then , having outmuscled @entity108 deep inside his own half , @entity4 charged fully 50 yards before feeding @entity40 who drew back for the unmarked @entity31 , the defender somehow populating @entity27 ’s penalty area			1
but he failed to climax the swift break and stabbed wide from just eight yards			0
the @entity5 midfielder cut inside from the left wing and fired a right - foot shot into the bottom corner with 20 minutes to play @entity4 's goal earned @entity26 their first victory of the @entity79 campaign but kept them in the bottom three @entity4 celebrates his winner at @entity8 after scoring the only goal of the game in the 71st minute home left back @entity32 then slammed down the throat of goalkeeper @entity47 from range having seized upon some slack passing in @entity27 ’s midfield			1
but for all of that early promise , @entity26 should have fallen behind when @entity129 – dozing in possession midway inside his own half – was robbed and @entity54 teed up @entity132 who prodded tamely at @entity28 from 12 yards			1
with @entity27 finishing the half much the stronger , @entity28 lost flight of @entity135 ’s cross-cum - shot and the ball cracked the upright , the goalkeeper ’s blushes spared			0
under pressure @entity26 manager @entity11 ( right ) celebrates @entity4 's winner at @entity8 @entity4 cut in from the left wing to score his winning goal but spent most of the game on the right at @entity8 , as his heat map ( below ) illustrates - click here for match zone from @entity8 @entity26 defender @entity31 had a brilliant chance in the first half but failed to hit the target as he shot wide @entity26 defender @entity32 ( left ) attempts a header at goal during the @entity79 clash at @entity8 @entity27 's @entity155 maintains control of the ball despite a challenge from @entity26 's @entity35 @entity159 miles @entity26 110.7 68.8 @entity36 90 11.6 7.2 @entity37 90 11.3 7.0 @entity29 90 11.0 6.8 @entity27 112.1 69.7 @entity160 90 12.0 7.4 @entity132 90 11.8 7.3 @entity54 90 11.1 6.9 the half expired goalless with home fans booing their side ’s performance , but they were soon cheering when their jazzy new screen relayed news of @entity168 ’s 8 - 0 thrashing at @entity169			1
kicking towards the ‘ screen end ’ after the break , the hosts came within a few inches of breaking the deadlock when @entity37 , sizing a shot from 20 yards , saw his effort deflected just wide by the boot of a sliding @entity50			1
buoyed by that near miss , @entity26 pressed for an opener and should have had it when @entity51 gifted a chance to @entity40			2
the left back , perhaps blinded by his own team - mates , failed to notice @entity40 lurking on the shoulder of the defence when he rolled a ball back towards @entity47			0
the @entity189 striker pounced and rounded the keeper only to wedge into the side - netting from a narrow angle – not narrow enough to mitigate what was a glaring miss , however			0
@entity11 , spinning on his heels , shot a despairing look towards his dugout , for he knew the screen should have been replaying its first goal			2
@entity36 stung the palms of @entity47 with a dipping free - kick soon after			0
but there was nothing the @entity204 custodian could do to keep out @entity4 ’s blast			2
cutting infield from the left , his low drill flew beyond @entity47 with the aid of a slight deflection , @entity11 responding with a trademark fist - pump not sighted in a long while			2
on a day of delays , the winning feeling was worth the wait			0
the game was delayed by an hour after a problem with the new electrical scoreboard at @entity8 the new electronic scoreboard came loose , forcing the @entity79 clash to be delayed until 4pm supporters were kept waiting outside @entity8 until 3.15pm as the ground remained closed due to the scoreboard problems			1

@entity4 scored winner 20 minutes from the end at @entity8
@entity5 fired @entity26 to their first @entity79 win of the season
@entity11 's side remain in 18th place and in @entity79 *relegation* zone despite win
game delayed by an hour due to a problem with electronic scoreboard at @entity8
