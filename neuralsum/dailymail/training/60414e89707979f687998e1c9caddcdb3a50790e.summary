when i came back round my hands were already tied behind my back and there was @entity1 wrapping tape around my mouth			0
' in a apparent warning of what the couple would later do to their victims , they told her : ' we are going to keep you in the cellar and let our friends use you and , when they have finished with you , we will kill you and bury you under the paving stones of @entity12			0
there are hundreds of girls there ... the police have n't found them and they wo n't find you ! ' ms @entity8 , who feared the couple would try and ' operate ' on her , was raped by @entity29 , but later managed to escape			1
she told the police , but the charge against the @entity11 was dropped to indecent assault after ms @entity8 decided she did not want to be questioned in court			1
in the new tv documentary , she says she now feels guilty about the decision , which may have allowed the couple to go free to commit their murders			2

ms @entity112 was a neighbour who was invited to the couple 's home after telling @entity29 she was a lesbian			2

we only ever had sex once but he was a wee bit more gentle			0
