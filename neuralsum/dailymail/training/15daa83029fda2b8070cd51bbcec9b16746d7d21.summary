@entity0 , pictured , is being forced to pay child support payments after donating his sperm @entity0 did n’t want children , but his lesbian friends did – so he agreed to donate his sperm			1
now his ‘ act of kindness ’ has come back to haunt him 13 years later , after he received a letter demanding child support payments			2
mr @entity0 has not spoken to the family he helped create since 2004			1
he was not named on the birth certificates of the two children , and played no role in their upbringing – but the @entity15 insists he has to pay £ 26 a week to support them			2
he says he can not afford the payments , which will add up to £ 8,000 before both children reach adulthood			1
the 47 - year - old book - keeper from @entity21 has been in a relationship with his partner @entity23 , 37 , for 17 years			2
‘ me and @entity23 were not interested in having children of our own , ’ he said			0
‘ when the idea [ of donating sperm ] was suggested , we thought it sounded like a lovely thing to do			0
but the last few months have been a complete nightmare			0
‘ i feel as if i am the victim of a state - sponsored blackmail plot ... it was purely an act of kindness on my part and now i am being made to pay			0
’ mr @entity0 and mr @entity23 met the women in a gay nightclub in @entity39 in 1997 , and became good friends			1
when one of the women revealed she was desperate to have children mr @entity0 agreed to help , as long as there were no strings attached			1
‘ i did not ask for anything to be documented legally and with hindsight perhaps i should have done , ’ he said			0
after the birth of a baby girl in late 1998 , mr @entity0 was asked to donate again – and a second girl was born in 2000			1
when the children were young , mr @entity0 remained in touch with the mother , and saw the girls at social events			1
he said he was surprised when introduced as their father and later advised the children to ask their mother to explain the facts of their birth			0
the two couples eventually drifted apart , and apart from occasional letters from the girls mr @entity0 has had no contact with the family since 2004			1
the 47 - year - old book - keeper from @entity21 has had no contact with the family since 2004 in the intervening years the lesbian couple separated , leaving the biological mother with both children			1
she has since started claiming benefits from the @entity75			0
mr @entity0 received his letter from the @entity15 in june			1
he said the biological mother ’s former partner continues to live near the former family home and sees the girls at weekends – but is not being chased for child support			0
he stressed that he made sure the couple had the funds to bring up children before he donated his sperm			0
the @entity15 said that if mr @entity0 had used an official sperm donation centre he would not have to pay child support – but informal arrangements are not covered by the law			2
mr @entity0 argues that the rules should be changed			2
the only way he can protest against the @entity15 ’s ruling is by taking his case to a judicial review , which could cost in the region of £ 60,000			0
last night the mother of the children said : ‘ it ’s all being dealt with at the moment and i do n’t want to comment			0
