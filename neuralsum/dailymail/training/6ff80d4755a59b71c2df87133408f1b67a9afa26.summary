the @entity12 - born photographer has spent 15 years documenting the overcrowded and sweaty conditions on a subway network used daily by 11 million people what a squeeze ! these passengers do n't have an inch in which to move and are pressed up against the steamy glass windows			1
the one on the left stares out of the carriage , while the one on the right seeks solace in music @entity5 is world famous for its urban density and so the public transport nightmare is hardly surprising			0
and despite being squeezed and stretched every day , it 's the dignified way the commuters cope with the depressing daily grind that @entity11 's pictures bring out			1
he has just released a third volume of pictures in his portfolio ' @entity20 ' which has been published in a book by @entity49 and @entity50			1
standing on the platform as the doors snap shut , @entity11 has been able to capture a whole range of expressions from his unwilling and trapped subjects			2
some stare disconcertingly at the lens , others close their eyes to try and escape the brutal overcrowding , while others have their faces contorted against the steamy glass windows			0
sardines : @entity11 has been taking pictures of the @entity5 morning rush hour for 15 years , working monday to friday between 7.30 and 8.45am at the same subway station forty winks : many passengers close their eyes to try and think about something other than the crush , @entity11 found , while the man on the left gives out a yawn which suggests he may need a bit more sleep going head to head : you never know who you will be squeezing up against on the @entity81			1
many frequent commuters have worked out their own personal methods of winning some space , taking advantage of anything they may have to hand - umbrellas , bags and briefcases - to make room @entity11 first experienced the @entity16 subway network when reporting on the aftermath of the sarin nerve gas attack which killed 16 people and injured 6,000 in 1995			1
his collection of images quickly grew into a portfolio first exhibited in 2008			0
' i shot six frames of faces of early morning commuters in subway windows which turned out to be very powerful images , ' said @entity11 to @entity104 of his work			1
' i spent 20 days [ monday to friday ] every morning from 7.30 until 8.45 at the same subway station shooting portraits of people on their way to work			1
' ' the images create a sense of discomfort as his victims attempt to squirm out of view or simply close their eyes , wishing the photographer to go away , ' reads the description on @entity11 's website			2
' @entity20 depicts an urban hell and by hunting down these commuters with his camera , @entity11 highlights the complete vulnerability of the city at its most extreme			1
' ghostly : some of the commuters take on a hauntingly pale complexion , giving the impression they are hopelessly trapped on their journey push button to exit : the trains are packed to capacity between first light and late morning in @entity5 , with the carriages appearing fit to burst as they arrive into the stations			0
white - gloved ' oshiya ' or pushers have been employed on the network since 1955 to forcibly shove passengers into the carriages eleven million commuters use @entity5 's transport network every morning , with suburban and subway trains reliably packed to the brim from first light to late morning			2
it is a sign that @entity5 's tsukin jigoku [ commuting hell ] has grown steadily out of hand that the railway companies have employed white - gloved oshiya ( pushers ) to shove passengers into carriages since 1955			0
regular commuters have become deft at performing what is known as the @entity5 pirouette , which allows them to slide into the carriage and then stand without having to make eye contact with those who have moved aside			0
scuffles between frustrated commuters have become more and more common , while notorious chikan [ subway molesters ] take advantage of the overcrowding to fondle fellow passengers			0
passengers are well trained in using whatever they have on them - bags , briefcases and umbrellas , for example - to fight for space			0
police have reported a massive rise in ' commuter incidents ' - injuries and assaults			0
cheek to cheek : being squashed against the glass of a subway train is a common occurrence in @entity5 , where as many as 11 million people use the creaking network to get to and from work every day @entity188 up : in situations like this , all you can do is try and keep your spirits up			1
@entity11 was surprised by the dignity and stoicism of the passengers , despite the ever - worsening transport nightmare			2
