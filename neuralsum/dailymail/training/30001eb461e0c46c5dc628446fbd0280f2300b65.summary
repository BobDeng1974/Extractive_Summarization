by @entity0 with a loving husband , perfect little boy and stellar modelling career , @entity1 seems to have it all			1
but the stunning @entity7 supermodel , 30 , confesses that she suffered body insecurities and feared for her job while she was pregnant			1
in fact @entity1 says she hated pregnancy and found the changes her body went through ' quite shocking '			1
@entity1 feared the potential impact carrying a child would have on her body - and her career			1
but after a year off to look after her 14 - month - old @entity27 , she landed right back on her feet after as the face of @entity30			1
' being pregnant affected my work quite early on - it 's not like you can work until you 're eight months pregnant			1
it was quite frightening seeing my body change so much , ' she tells the @entity38 magazine			1
' yes , i did worry about the impact , because my body is my job and my livelihood			1
also , i like working and i do n't like sitting around at home , so i really wanted to get back into things			2
it 's nice once the baby 's here , but then i was like , " i really want to do something again			2
" ' she also said that she and @entity15 sometimes leave @entity27 for days with their nanny , as neither of their families live nearby to help out with @entity27			2
' my family does n't live near and my husband 's family lives a couple of hours away , and both of our jobs are so unpredictable , ' she says			2
' sometimes there is nothing you can do and you have to leave him with the nanny for a couple of days			2
' the model holds an exclusive contract with @entity70 now , and clearly has nothing to worry about these days she recently opened up about the moment she arrived for a modelling shoot and was told she was no longer needed , shortly after announcing she was in the early stages of pregnancy			1
she said : ' i was really upset at the time			0
i had n't yet had my three - month scan and i felt really vulnerable about everything			0
' i no longer had a job			0
that was it - i had to just stop everything that i knew , the way my life was			0
' and things did n't change after her baby son arrived , she told @entity89 : ' i 've had a few meetings because when they hear pregnancy they freak out a bit , so they need to see if i fit in their clothes			0
' everyone 's so nice to you all the time			0
and it 's like , " ugh , " you do n't have to be			0
it feels quite alienating because it 's like everyone 's just lying to you			0
' the proud parents are holidaying in @entity17 and still looked very much smitten but the model , who holds exclusive contracts with @entity70 and @entity30 , clearly has nothing to worry about these days , as she 's regained her knockout figure with the help of celebrity trainer @entity113			0
she left little @entity27 at home to take a stroll and soak up the scorching sun on the @entity117 with @entity118 comedian husband @entity15 , 42			0
the proud parents are holidaying in @entity17 and still looked very much smitten as they walked down the streets together hand in hand , keeping close to one another at all times			0
at one point , the lovebirds stopped outside one shop for a quick breather , where @entity1 towered over the @entity129 's @entity128 judge to give him an affectionate kiss			1
@entity15 channeled his wife 's attire by wearing an all - white ensemble as he carried a fair few shopping bags with him , after what looked like a successful spree			0
meanwhile @entity1 looked incredible in a loose - fitting white mini-dress and strappy black sandals , which highlighted her toned legs perfectly .			1
