@entity1 account , @entity2 , documents some of the worst abusive messages women receive on dating sites , such as @entity6			1
from threats of violence to comments on bra size , the account is enough to make any woman want to avoid internet dating			2
but @entity15 blogger , @entity14 , wanted to show that not all @entity6 men are bad – and set up a trap to prove her point			1
@entity15 blogger , @entity14 , wanted to show that not all @entity6 men are bad – and set up a trap to prove her point			1
pictured above are the common words used in the responses sent by men on the app she created up a fake female @entity6 profile of a girl named @entity27 used an automatic tool to right - swipe 1,000 profiles of men in @entity31 and another 1,000 in @entity32			1
right - swiping means that you would like to be matched with that person			1
if that person also swipes right on your profile then you ’re a match and can message them			0
in this experiement , a thousand matched and then messaged @entity27			2
since this was a robot and not actually her , none of the men received any responses			1
ms @entity14 says this high number is n’t unusual on @entity6			1
‘ her match rate was actually 70 per cent , ’ she told @entity48			0
ms @entity14 created up a fake female @entity6 profile of a girl named @entity27 and created a robot that right - swiped on 1,000 profiles of men in @entity31 and another 1,000 in @entity32			1
more than thousand matched and then messaged @entity27 , but not turned hostile despite not receiving a response the experiment was a response to @entity1 account , @entity2 , allows women to share screenshots of abusive messages they receive on dating sites , such as @entity6 ms @entity14 said she thought some men may become hostile after being ignored , as shown in these screenshots from @entity66 's @entity1 account			1
however , this was not the case ‘ there are a lot more men than women on @entity6 , and often times a large fraction of the men in a women 's swipe queue have already right - swiped on her , so they 're " pre-swiped " in a sense and will insta - match			1
’ here 's a unique way to find your next date			0
@entity83 engineer @entity82 was tired of wasting time on @entity6 , so he decided to take matters into his own hands			1
using a computer programme , along with a clever motor setup and a stylus , the @entity88 , @entity89 - based @entity87 developer came up with a way to get through as many of his potential soulmates as quickly as possible			2
@entity95 recently revealed that @entity6 was one of the most downloaded apps of the year			2
and - until now - it required users ' undivided attention while perusing profiles			2
but mr @entity82 's hilarious contraption , shown in the video below , allows @entity6 fans to swipe right forever - or at least until they run out of potential matches near them			1
ms @entity14 said she thought some men may become hostile after being ignored , as shown in sites such as @entity66			1
but out of 1,007 men who messaged @entity27 , none turned aggressive or rude			0
‘ just about everyone who messaged her was friendly and respectful , ’ said ms @entity14			2
‘ sure , there was teasing , guys who were straightforward about their intention to hook up , and plenty of bad pickup lines			0
’ ‘ but no one became hostile or resorted to name - calling			0
’ some of the matches took the time to ask her meaningful questions			0
many of them even googled her company - which was listed in her profile - in an effort to make conversation			0
‘ so if these @entity6 horror stories are so common , how come we did n’t find a single one among over a thousand messages ? ’ ms @entity14 writes on her blog			1
‘ it ’s like shark attacks			0
we hear about them in the news every summer , but only five people a year die of shark attacks			0
‘ it ’s the negative stories that get all the attention			0
stories about men being decent and polite just are n’t as interesting as the stories of men being jerks			2
’ ‘ but here it is			0
evidence that the vast majority of guys are actually pretty decent			0
’ @entity150 reveals that many men become instantly aggressive when a woman fails to show interest			0
however , ms @entity14 believe the claims have been exaggerated the account shows that many of the women find themselves facing a barrage of indecent questions			1
ms @entity14 says this is n't common			2
' it ’s like shark attacks , ' she says			0
