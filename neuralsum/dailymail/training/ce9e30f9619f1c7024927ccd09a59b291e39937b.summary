by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 07:06 est , 23 april 2013 it would not be out of place speeding around famous @entity4 circuits like @entity5 or @entity6			2
but incredibly , this racing car is not the real thing			2
rather than being built in a high - tech garage by a team of expert engineers , it was instead put together in a shed in @entity13 by a complete novice			2
@entity15 , who has no engineering experience , spent four years piecing together the @entity18 replica at his @entity20 home			1
creative : this full - size replica @entity23 car was hand built by @entity4 fan @entity15 in his shed in @entity13 dedicated : mr @entity15 has no engineering experience and spent four years piecing together the @entity18 replica a working second - hand version would have set mr @entity15 back around £ 100,000 - but his cost just £ 8,000 , and hundreds of man hours			1
the racing enthusiast hand built his version in a specially designed shed , using parts sourced on @entity31 and swapped with fellow @entity23 memorabilia collectors			2
mr @entity15 , who created the replica without even using a manual or guide , said : ' a couple of years ago there was a @entity4 car on display in a @entity40 showroom near @entity13			1
' i went along to see it and thought to myself ' " i would love one of these			2
" ' soon after his visit , a company called @entity47 listed a former @entity23 car 's chassis on @entity50 it failed to attract a single bid , mr @entity15 speculatively emailed the seller - and was delighted to learn there were two more also up for grabs			1
office - worker mr @entity15 said : ' i did a deal with him there and then			1
a little while later , he turned up on my doorstep with a @entity59 and @entity60 chassis			2
i paid him cash for the pair			0
' he added : ' i have n't just bought things from @entity31 , though			0
there 's a whole group of memorabilia sites and dealers around the @entity68 , but also you start to build a network of contacts and they know you are looking for a particular types of car parts			0
bargain : a working second - hand version of the car would have set mr @entity15 back around £ 100,000 - but his cost just £ 8,000 and hundreds of man hours			1
this is the shed in which he built the car pride and joy : mr @entity15 built the car using parts sourced on @entity31 and swapped with fellow @entity23 memorabilia collectors ' then when stuff turns up , they let me know			1
i get one or two emails a week from people saying , " do you need a new floor ? "			0
' also i check @entity31 religiously every morning			0
it 's really immaterial what it costs as the people on there do not necessarily realise the value it has to you			0
they think it 's just a worthless old control box from a @entity18			1
' delighted : @entity23 enthusiast @entity15 poses with his full - size replica car despite having no formal training or knowledge of the race car construction industry , mr @entity15 set about handcrafting the replica during his spare time			1
he managed to track down every last detail of the car - including authentic suspension systems , wheels , tires , steering wheel and a seat			0
mr @entity15 added : ' i slowly started to plan out what i could do with the car , and it quickly became clear that it was very difficult , or even impossible , to get the right parts			1
i have to use what i can get , from whatever racing car that may be			0
' now , after four years ’ hard labour , all that is left to complete the replica is an engine - which mr @entity15 hopes to locate within the next few years			1
he said : ' i have got it to the point now where i can pretty much get it rolling , but you could not drive it			0
' the wishbones would probably snap on the first bend			0
' in the next year or two , when i can find more of the correct parts , and some spares , i will get it properly rolling			0
' the beauty of having your own @entity4 car is that you can just build up at your own pace , go to tracks you want to go to and do your own thing			0
' mr @entity15 hopes to have the car complete soon , but admits he has already started thinking about the next project			2
passionate : mr @entity15 managed to track down every last detail of the car - including authentic suspension systems , wheels , tires , steering wheel and a seat impressive : now , after four years ' hard labour , all that is left to complete the replica is an engine - which @entity15 hopes to locate within the next few years			1
this is one of the parts from the car			0
