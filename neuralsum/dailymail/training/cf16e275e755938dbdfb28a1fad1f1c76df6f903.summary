by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 13:50 est , 14 march 2013 two garage bosses have had to pull the plug on their transistor radio after they were hit with two bills for licence fees			1
@entity6 and @entity7 have refused to pay an extra £ 43.20 a year to listen to their radio at their two - man workshop after they had already paid £ 139			1
the duo have argued that as nobody apart from themselves enter the garage @entity15 , in @entity17 , @entity18 , they should not have to pay the extra fees			1
@entity6 says he and his workmate now have to work in silence after they were handed the ' scandalous ' double bill @entity6 ( pictured ) and friend @entity24 's @entity17 garage have been ordered to pay two bills for playing their radio the two friends have had a radio in the workshop since 1981 , but when they were called this year by @entity32 - who represent performers - and the person heard their radio , they were told this year they would have to pay a fee			1
@entity6 and @entity24 were ordered to pay two separate licensing agencies - the @entity32 and the @entity38			1
the @entity38 acts for the writers and composers and the @entity32 represent the interests of the performers			1
the men paid a £ 139 to @entity32 for the year but were then asked to pay £ 3.60 a month by the @entity38			1
they refused to pay for the second licence - which all businesses are obliged to - and have switched off their radio			1
@entity7 , 56 , said : ' it 's an absolute scandal			0
' so we just put the radio in the boot of the car and took it home			0
' it 's a very private workshop with two people in it			0
it is not as if we had a room full of people watching tv and listening to music			2
@entity6 and @entity24 were ordered to pay two separate licensing agencies - the @entity32 and the @entity38 ' it was just the two of us listening to @entity60			1
' even if it is only another £ 40 it 's a joke			0
they can say what they like but it is not as if we have a waiting room or anything else for the public			2
' if a two man workshop is a public space what 's a car then ? or a 12 seater people carrier ? ' it has really got our backs up and that 's why we 've taken the radio out - not so much the money			2
' @entity6 , 59 , said : ' it 's a fiddle			0
we have paid one lot and now we 've had to stop listening to the radio anyway because we do n't want to pay the other lot			2
' so now we have to work in silence all day			0
we have had a radio since 1981			0
we are two self employed people			0
we do n't have a reception area or anything			0
' where we are we are not going get many of the public down here and most of the time the doors are down anyway			2
' @entity24 added : ' apparently we 're broadcasting but i do n't see how			0
@entity6 could n't hear it most of the time because he was working under a car			0
' he could only listen when he came up to have a cup of tea			0
' no one else is allowed in the workshop area anyway			0
if they came into the office to pay their bill they might be able to hear it - but only just			2
' the tiny garage objected to the extra payment , and have now packed up their radio and now work without music @entity17 mp @entity109 said : ' these musical licensing agencies are particularly aggressive towards some small businesses			1
' if they were driving around in a car instead of working on them they could listen to it for free			0
' @entity32 press officer @entity117 said : ' when recorded music is played in the workplace , two licences are usually required			1
' this is because copyright protects musical compositions and lyrics separately from the recordings of them			0
' @entity32 licenses the use of the recordings , the fees from which go to many thousands of record companies and performers			1
' @entity38 licenses the use of the compositions and lyrics , the fees from which go to many thousands of composers and publishers			1
' these two organisations exist to ensure that those who invest their time , money and talent to create the music people love , are fairly rewarded for the use of their work			2
' research has shown that music within the workplace can have significant business benefits , including improving staff morale and reducing employee sick days			0
' despite being separate organisations , @entity32 and @entity38 work closely together and already operate a number of joint licensing solutions to further simplify licensing for businesses			1
' ' a @entity38 licence pays royalties to those that have written , composed and published the music and a @entity32 licence pays royalties to the artists that have recorded the music and the record labels that own the recording			1
' for a workplace with only 2 employees the licence cost from @entity38 would be £ 3.60 per month			2

ordered to pay two separate licensing agencies - the @entity32 and the @entity38
argue that as nobody else uses garage they should not have to pay it
businesses and public places are *liable* to pay fees to broadcast music
