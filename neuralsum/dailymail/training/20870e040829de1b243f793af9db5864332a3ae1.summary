by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 13 august 2013 like many in the @entity1 , building a home on the range was a paper dream for @entity5			1
but unlike many , @entity5 made his @entity7 reality - by building a house entirely out of paper			1
and the unique property in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity1 , has stood the test of time - its paper walls , paper furniture and even paper grandfather clock are going strong after more than 90 years			1
@entity5 , a mechanical engineer who designed the machines that make paper clips , began building the house as a hobby			1
he began his project in 1922 and completed it in 1924			2
the house opened as a museum in the 1930s			1
mr @entity5 's great niece @entity41 now runs the @entity42 , after taking it on from her mother			2
ms @entity41 said : ' @entity44 blows in , sometimes snow , but it 's held up pretty well considering how old it is			0
' @entity47 was curious and wanted to see what would happen to the paper , and well , here it is , some 90 years later			2
kitted out : the house has paper walls , paper furniture and even a paper piano building blocks : little paper logs were cut with a craft knife and glued or nailed together ' there 's lots of varnish on the @entity42 walls			1
but we do n't varnish the inside of the house because the more you put on , the darker it gets and we really just like to leave it so you can still read the papers			2
' mr @entity5 lived in the @entity42 during the summer months from 1924 to 1930			0
after the wall material was made and he was already living inside the house , he made the furniture			1
' the furniture is made out of little paper logs , ' said ms @entity41			1
' the little rolls of paper are maybe a half inch thick and they 're all cut to different sizes - cut with a knife			2
then they 're glued or nailed together			0
' mr @entity5 lived in @entity80 , @entity16			1
well equipped : a paper piano and a grandfather clock which is made from a paper from each of the 48 states that made up the @entity1 at the time news desk : this table is made entirely from old copies of the periodical @entity89 while making the @entity42 , he mixed his own glue to put the paper together			1
ms @entity41 said : ' it was basically flour and water , but he would add little sticky substances like apple peels			0
' it has really lasted			0
the furniture is usable , and quite heavy			2
' all of the furniture in the house is made from paper , including the grandfather clock and piano			1
inside the clock is a paper from each one of the 48 states in it , so there are all the state capitals and you can read them all the way down the front of the clock			1
as it was made in the 1930s , the only two papers missing are those for @entity118 and @entity119			2
home sweet home : mechanical engineer @entity5 lived in his @entity42 in the summer from 1924 to 1930 ' this is a small town , ' said ms @entity41			0
' @entity122 got around that this man was making a house out of paper			1
' i still feel responsible for it , but i do n't worry about it			0
' it 's been here since 1924 , so i guess if a storm was going to blow it over , then so be it			0
' here it sits and you ca n't spend your life worrying that something is going to happen to it			0
you just take care of it and that 's it			0
' when most people hear about the @entity42 , they just ask , " why ? " ' i do n't really know the answer			0
i do n't really know why unless he was just really thrifty or something			0
' newspapers were pretty inexpensive and everybody gave him the newspapers			0
' admission to the @entity42 is $ 2.00 for adults and $ 1.00 for children aged between six and 14 .			0
