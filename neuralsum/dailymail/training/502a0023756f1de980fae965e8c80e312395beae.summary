company director @entity11 , 47 , who was married with 11 children , was on a two - week break with his family and other members of the orthodox jewish community when the accident happened			1
he had gone waist - deep into the sea off @entity5 , @entity18 , with one of his sons and other @entity9 men to perform the ‘ mikveh ’ ritual , which involves immersing themselves in water for purification			1
but while his friends returned to shore , mr @entity2 , who was the director of a property business in @entity28 , @entity29 , as well as running a rabbinical college , was dragged under by a large wave			1
@entity34 was told that witnesses saw mr @entity2 begin shouting and frantically waving his arms for help as he struggled against the waves			1
holidaymaker @entity39 said that he and his girlfriend were walking along the seafront at 7.55am on august 2 when they noticed the men in the sea			1
‘ we watched them undress a little and dip in and out of the water , ’ mr @entity39 said			2
‘ i saw one of them go in further			2
he was in for a bit before realising he was in trouble			2
he tried waving and shouting out to the others for help			2
’ accident : the rabbi was staying at the scenic seaside town of @entity5 in @entity18 when tragedy struck accident : paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was declared dead at @entity62 , @entity5 the couple struggled to pull a life - ring from its box on the seafront , while a friend of mr @entity2 went back into the water to help			1
another witness , @entity69 , said : ‘ i went down with the ring to try to save the gentleman			1
i think the rope got tangled in the panic to get it out of the box , but the man was too far out and i could n’t throw it far enough to reach him			2
‘ he was in the water with his hands in the air , calling for help , but the waves kept pushing the ring back			0
' then he was lying face down in the water and drifting			0
’ when asked by coroner @entity86 whether he would have gone swimming that morning , mr @entity69 replied : ‘ no , it was too rough			0

’ thousands attended mr @entity2 ’s funeral , with some travelling from as far as the @entity103 and @entity104 post-mortem examination found that mr @entity2 drowned			1
mr @entity86 recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
most religious @entity9 in @entity108 who perform the mikveh ritual do so in small tiled pools built at community centres or @entity9 colleges , which are filled with warm rainwater			0
if by the coast , however , the ritual can be performed in the sea			1
mikveh water has to be natural - either rain , spring or sea water			1
immersion symbolises a change of status , the idea being that those who enter as impure , emerge purified			0
the actual dipping involves standing in the water and immersing the whole body underneath the surface			0
those undergoing the ritual have to be completely clean			0
in the hours before , people bathe , brush their teeth , use tooth picks , cut their nails , remove all make - up , nail polish and contact lenses so there are no barriers between them and the @entity141 men perform the mikveh every day			2
jewish people have been performing the ritual in the @entity108 since at least the 13th century			0
the hebrew word mikveh literally translates as a ‘ collection ’ , referring to the collection of water .			0
