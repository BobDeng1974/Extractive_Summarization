armed robber @entity0 , 54 , was awarded £ 500 compensation after delays in the prison system breached his human rights a paedophile and a dangerous armed robber have won hundreds of pounds in compensation after judges controversially ruled delays in the prison system breached their human rights			1
in a ruling certain to spark outrage among victims , @entity0 , 54 , and @entity14 , 55 , were awarded controversial pay - outs because they were forced to spend longer in prison			1
the @entity17 said a shortage of places on treatment courses meant the criminals had been forced to endure ‘ excessive delays ’ to their release dates			1
it is feared the decision could open the compensation floodgates and lead even more prisoners to bring legal claims if they are not freed on schedule			0
the ruling is also another blow to justice secretary @entity32 who last week was told his ban on sending books to inmates in jail was unlawful			0
taxpayers have already spent more than £ 20,000 in legal aid so they could fight the cases which had already been thrown out by the @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity0 , a career criminal from @entity43 , @entity44 , was jailed for life in 2003 for a ‘ very serious ’ armed bank robbery committed with two other masked men			1
the raiders – at least one of whom carried a sawn - off shotgun – jumped down from the roof of the @entity54 branch in @entity55 , @entity44 , after closing time while only a skeleton staff was on duty			0
they ordered four terrified female bank clerks to lie on the floor and think of their families , then forced their way into the safe and escaped with £ 78,000 cash			0
@entity0 was told in june 2011 he would shortly be moved to an open prison at @entity64 , @entity65 ( pictured )			1
the move was postponed because of a ' logjam ' @entity0 , who was arrested by armed police outside @entity70 as he took his girlfriend to be treated for a broken arm , was later handed a life sentence under the ‘ two strikes and you ’re out ’ policy			2
at the time of the offence he had been out on licence for just two months following an eight - year sentence for an attempted raid on a security van in @entity83			0
he had also received a five year sentence in 1992 for his part in another armed robbery on a security van			0
@entity0 was told in june 2011 he would shortly be moved to an open prison at @entity64 , @entity65			2
but the move was postponed because of a ‘ logjam ’ caused by other prisoners whose progress through the system had been affected by the shortage of treatment courses			2
judges at the @entity17 ruled @entity0 had endured a 12 - month delay and awarded him £ 500 compensation			1
in the second case , @entity14 , who had a string of criminal convictions for robbery , fraud , theft and indecent assault , was convicted in may 2008 of a series of sex offences against young boys			2
the former railway guard , from @entity112 , was given an ipp ( imprisonment for public protection ) sentence with a minimum term of two - and - a - half years			0
paedophile @entity14 also received a pay - out following a hearing at the @entity17 ( pictured above ) in @entity118 but a shortage of sex offender treatment places meant his release was ‘ delayed unacceptably ’ by about a year , said the @entity17			1
he was awarded £ 600 compensation			1
both cases were a breach of @entity126 , which protects the right to liberty			0
the judges said the delays had ‘ deprived [ them ] of a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that [ they were ] no l longer a danger to the public			2
’ the court rejected similar claims by sex offender @entity140 , 53 , who has a series of convictions against young girls , and @entity144 , 33 , serving a minimum term of two years and eight months for a offences including robbery			0
a @entity149 spokesman said : ‘ we welcome the @entity17 ’s findings that indeterminate sentence prisoners are not being detained arbitrarily , even if there are regrettable delays in providing them with access to course work which they definitely need in order to reduce their risk			1
‘ we will study other parts of the judgment carefully to determine how best we can support those on indeterminate sentence towards their potential release			0
