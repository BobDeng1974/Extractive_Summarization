it is easy to understand the distaste that so many feel for @entity3 he is brash , he can be crass , and when it comes to being a braggart , he is the undisputed world champion			1
he is the cartoon embodiment of the excess for which his adopted home town of @entity10 is notorious			2
a poor kid from @entity13 , @entity14 , he has spent his adult life over-compensating for the deprivation he once knew			2
he has tossed handfuls of $ 100 bills into the air at a strip club and hurled wads of cash into a swimming pool so he could amuse himself by watching girls dive to retrieve them			2
the mouthguard he will wear during ‘ the @entity28 ’ with @entity29 at the @entity30 on saturday night cost $ 25,000 and is inlaid with a $ 100 bill			1
@entity3 is boxing ’s undisputed braggart - and a brilliant performer in the ring @entity3 will take on @entity29 on saturday in the most eagerly awaited fight of the century some novelists like to assign names to their protagonists that reflect their character traits or their obsessions			1
@entity3 has saved everyone the trouble with his chosen nickname			1
@entity46 reigned until the build - up to this fight began			1
then , he took to referring to himself as @entity49 , or @entity50			1
he is better than @entity51 and @entity52 ever were , @entity3 said this week			1
mayweather , it is also worth pointing out , has faced a string of accusations of violence against women and spent two months in the @entity58 in 2012 for a domestic violence conviction			2
although the fight is not quite the struggle between light and darkness that @entity29 ’s supporters would have you believe , it is true that @entity3 is not exactly a gentleman hero			1
but in sport ’s spoiled , sycophantic world where no one ever tells the genius that he is out of line , that hardly makes him unusual			1
a floored @entity74 feels the force of @entity51 after his rope - a - dope tactic in the heat of @entity78 @entity79 ( right ) goes toe - to - toe with @entity81 in their second fight in 1989 there is a danger here , though			1
it lies in confusing our perceptions of @entity3 as a man with a desire to belittle his capabilities as a fighter			1
you might want him to lose to @entity29 but you better accept that he probably wo n’t			1
he is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing			1
he may not be @entity98			1
debates aimed at placing that crown on one head are , essentially , specious but it is legitimate to claim that @entity3 is one of the best ever			1
he has fought the best fighters of his generation , @entity29 aside , and beaten every one of them			1
@entity29 ’s trainer , @entity105 , said last week that @entity3 , 38 , had ducked too many fighters to be considered the greatest even of this era			1
a cursory examination of @entity3 ’s record does not bear that out			1
he has fought @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 and sent them all away broken			2
he has won titles at five different weights			0
he has fought men like @entity125 and @entity126 , who were supposed to be new forces in boxing , but whose limitations were exposed by @entity3 ’s ringcraft			1
that is the great irony of his dominance of the sport these past few years			2
he is scorned as a great vulgarian , a gaudy show - off , boxing ’s thug king , and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills			1
@entity3 attacks @entity126 during the his unanimous points win over his countryman @entity3 floored @entity125 in controversial fashion at the end of the fourth round boxing has always venerated the artist and swooned over practitioners of the sweet science and @entity3 personifies so much of what the purists admire			1
he does not club his foes into submission			0
he does not overwhelm them with savagery			0
he beats them with craft and cleverness			0
he is a wonderful technician in the mould of @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity51			1
the shoulder roll he uses to protect his head and body from attack is a conundrum that none of his opponents have been able to decode			0
he is a pugilist , not a scrapper			0
when @entity3 boxes , it is to put on an old - fashioned masterclass in the oft - neglected art of defensive combat			1
he makes himself devilishly hard to hit , and , slowly and steadily , picks off his opponent			0
his style has made fans of connoisseurs like the late , great fight trainer @entity182			1
@entity3 is not a crowd - pleaser			1
he is too good for that			0
he is so skilled that it is difficult for his opponent to land effective punches			0
his brand of brilliance does not make for explosive action but it does make for w after @entity191 after w on his record			0
he has 47 of them now to go with no defeats and no draws			0
@entity3 has attracted criticism for his uncouth displays of his wealth on social media @entity105 ( right ) is attemtping to force @entity3 to abandon his naturally cautious style @entity105 says he has attended @entity3 fights where fans have fallen asleep from boredom			2
he is trying to goad @entity46 into abandoning his usual style because he knows it represents @entity29 ’s best chance — perhaps only chance — of winning			1
@entity105 is a good man and a brilliant trainer but @entity46 is way too smart to fall for that			2
i take him to win by unanimous decision			0
@entity163 ’s t - shirt protest is no crime , @entity213 @entity213 have a chance to claw back at least a little of the dignity and the credibility they have lost in recent years when their disciplinary panel meets on may 21 to consider whether to fine @entity220 coach @entity219			2
@entity219 committed the heinous sin of expressing an opinion about something more important than football at his press conference last monday before @entity220 ’s @entity228 tie with @entity229			0
the punishment for that kind of deviancy is severe if precedent is anything to go by			0
@entity236 ’s twisted world fines you more heavily for wearing branded underpants than indulging in racist chanting			2
@entity219 wore the top demanding justice for @entity242 ' @entity241 who died in a car crash at the @entity244 @entity242 ' @entity245 ' @entity241 was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car @entity219 ’s crime is to have worn a t - shirt highlighting unanswered issues surrounding the death of a popular and respected @entity254 sports journalist during last year ’s @entity244			2
@entity255 , who was a friend of @entity256 and @entity258 boss @entity257 , was killed in a car crash in @entity260 and several details of the incident are yet to be explained			0
so @entity219 did the right thing			0
he wore a shirt bearing the slogan # @entity266			0
and sure enough , his charge ‘ for an incident of a non-sporting nature ’ will now be judged by @entity213 next month			0
it is strange , is n’t it , how we condemn our footballers for being one - dimensional and bemoan their lack of social conscience and say they are all spoiled little rich boys			2
and then as soon as they do something a bit different , as soon as they challenge us , as soon as they break free from the norm , @entity213 come down on them like a ton of bricks			0
if they have any sense left , they will dismiss the charge against @entity219 out of hand			0
@entity290 's clash with @entity291 at the @entity292 has little relevance for this season ’s title race			0
@entity291 are too far ahead for the result to matter			0
but it matters for next season			0
@entity290 , finally , are beginning to look like a team capable of fashioning a real challenge for the title again			0
they have improved this season despite being without three of their leading players , @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 , for much of the campaign			0
by winning at @entity308 and sweeping @entity309 aside , they have started to overcome psychological barriers			0
beat @entity291 and another of those barriers will have been shoved out of the way			0
@entity291 went five points clear after beating @entity290 2 - 0 in october with @entity314 and @entity315 scoring @entity317 and @entity318 face off during the last meeting between the two sides			2

@entity3 is brash , he can be crass , and when it comes to being a braggart , he is the undisputed world champion
*previously* known as @entity46 , he took to referring to himself as @entity49 , or @entity98 in the build - up to his fight with @entity29
he said this week he is better than @entity51 and @entity52 ever were
he is scorned as a great vulgarian and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills
you might want him to lose to @entity29 but you better accept that he probably wo n’t . he is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing
