by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 01:27 est , 7 may 2013 growing numbers of people go to church at @entity5 but for the rest of the year , congregations continue to shrink , figures show			1
the festive boost for the @entity9 follows years of secular attacks on @entity5			1
these include what the last archbishop of @entity13 , dr @entity12 , called ‘ weary annual attempts by right - thinking people to ban or discourage nativity plays or public carol - singing ’			0
bad figures : attendance figures show a drop in regular services , but an increase around the holidays , such as @entity5 attendance figures published yesterday show that more than 2.6million people went to @entity9 services on christmas day in 2011 , a 14.5 per cent increase on the previous year			1
@entity5 congregations in 2010 were pushed down by bad weather , but the numbers were still 8 per cent up on 2009			1
however , for the rest of 2011 , the records show a bleaker picture of continued decline			0
‘ average weekly attendance ’ , first measured a decade ago because people were said to go to church more often on days other than a sunday , was just over 1million , 0.3 per cent down on 2010 and 3 per cent below the 2009 level			2
‘ @entity41 sunday attendance ’ , covering just sunday services , was 807,472 , up 0.8 per cent on 2010 but down 2 per cent from 2009			2
holiday spirit : @entity5 service attendance in 2011 increased by 14.5 per cent on the previous year the number of church baptisms of children was up 4 per cent on the previous year , but funerals fell by 8 per cent over two years and marriages were down 2 per cent			1
a total of 51,880 couples were married in churches in 2011 , just above half the number in 1991			0
some dioceses showed big increases in congregations			0
average weekly attendance went up by more than 9 per cent in @entity57 , which was identified in the 2011 national census as the least religious place in the country , and more than 10 per cent in @entity61 and @entity62			2
however , it dropped by nearly 10 per cent in @entity13 , more than 8 per cent in @entity64 and 8 per cent in @entity65			0
but the @entity66 , the right reverend @entity67 , put a positive spin on the figures , saying they are ‘ heartening , especially the very strong growth in christmas day attendance			0
also welcome is the stabilising of the numbers of those who attend church services on a weekly basis ’			0
he added that ‘ there is a quiet confidence underlying these figures ... [ reflecting ] the wide nature of the ministry offered by the @entity9 – for all of life , @entity84 ’ .			1

@entity5 service attendance is up , according to the @entity9
