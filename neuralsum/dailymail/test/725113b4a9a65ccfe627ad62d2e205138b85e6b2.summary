@entity0 is what he is ; an excellent cup manager			1
he proved this yet again on thursday , when his @entity5 side blitzed past @entity7 favourites @entity6 by four goals to one on the @entity10 ' home turf			0
but despite managing some of the continent 's most established clubs since leaving @entity13 just over a decade ago - @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 ( albeit on an interim basis ) and @entity5 - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles			1
@entity0 famously guided @entity14 to the @entity20 in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes @entity0 remains popular at @entity22 , but when he left there were few regrets over his departure @entity26 is a @entity14 fan writer on 90min.com at @entity22 , we will be eternally grateful for the @entity20 trophy he delivered in 2005 , in spite of possessing what was , on paper at least , our worst accumulation of players in recent history			1
@entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad			0
all four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed			0
two years after @entity46 , @entity0 was ( almost ) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted , though it was n't quite good enough to overcome an improved @entity49 side on this occasion			2
for all the @entity52 's successes , he also brought in the hapless @entity36 and @entity54 forward @entity38 and although we ran @entity57 a close second two seasons after that , we actually ended up further away from the @entity61 title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign ( 2009 - 10 ) - a failure that signalled the end to an @entity22 tenure that also yielded our last @entity67			1
in between , he lumbered us with the @entity68 's , @entity69 's and @entity70 's of this world ; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except , of course , that it was the catalyst for our introduction to @entity76			0
@entity0 won the @entity67 with @entity14 in 2006 on penalties against @entity78 with @entity79 and @entity80 playing well together , @entity0 got close to the title , but never won it and for all his moments , i fully believe we are on the right track again under @entity86 , even if we ca n't quite clutch that final @entity20 spot this season - or miss out on the @entity67			1
that 's why , if @entity0 returns to @entity90 again in the summer - as is being speculated due to @entity5 's @entity92 shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the @entity95			1
his league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top - four rivals , unless @entity99 need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest @entity103			2
@entity14 's failure in the @entity61 means that @entity0 will always be remembered as a cup specialist as far as my uneducated eyes can see , someone like @entity78 would be the best place for your money , if you 're that way inclined			2
a sudden influx of largely @entity112 - based signings would bring ( mostly temporary ) excitement and they 'd probably do well in the cups - enough to banish memories of the @entity117 years at least			0
that 's where @entity0 excels ; @entity7 success at @entity121 and triumph in the @entity124 last term are further testament to this			2
but a threat to us and where we want to be ? it would only be a result of our own self - destruction			0
and thanks for the memories .			0

@entity0 won the @entity20 and @entity67 with @entity14
but the @entity52 is little more than a cup manager , lacking league titles
@entity14 fans are grateful to @entity0 for his successes
but the @entity95 faithful wo n't mind him coming back to @entity90 with new club
