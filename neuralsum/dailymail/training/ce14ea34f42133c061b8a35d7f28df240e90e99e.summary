@entity7 39 - 20 @entity9 - @entity8 , january 25 , 1987 this was the year i really got into @entity12 and i knew the rules and what to look out for			2
the sun setting over the iconic @entity16 in @entity17 made the whole event look beautiful			1
i remember watching up to the end of the first quarter and had school the next morning			0
but my mum stayed up and recorded the game on @entity24 but paused the adverts , because if you did n’t pause the adverts you would n’t get the whole game on one tape			0
that @entity2 started a period of about 10 years where my mum or dad would pause the adverts to get it all on a @entity24 video			2
in that game we saw @entity37 and @entity38 and two iconic teams			0
that ’s one @entity2 i remember for it ’s visual beauty			0
the iconic @entity16 in @entity42 , @entity17 on the day of @entity43 in 1987 head coach @entity44 is lifted into the air after the @entity7 beat the @entity9 @entity7 running back @entity46 scores a touchdown at the @entity16 in @entity17 2			2
@entity48 27 - 23 @entity50 - @entity49 , february 1 , 2009 this was the first @entity2 i watched live and i was fortunate enough to be sat just over the end zone when @entity54 threw the final touchdown to win the game for the @entity48			1
little did i know that the wide receivers coach for the @entity58 , @entity57 , was on that squad and he won a @entity2 ring in that game			2

@entity65 46 - 10 @entity3 - @entity43 , january 26 , 1986 this was the first @entity68 game that i ever saw			1
it was one of the best defenses that had ever played the game			0
i was n’t aware at the time , but as i slowly taught myself about the history of the game , i realised that @entity65 defense was one of the best to play the game			1
it was also the first time i saw @entity78 run the football and they had @entity81 aka ' @entity81 '			0
that was the season that made him a household name , even in @entity85			0
