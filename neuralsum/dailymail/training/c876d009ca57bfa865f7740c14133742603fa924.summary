@entity1 trainer @entity0 flies out to @entity2 this morning hoping filly living the life can make sure he lives the @entity6 dream			1
@entity7 , buoyed by last year ’s success , launches one of its strongest ever numerical challenges for the @entity11 which gets under way at @entity14 racecourse tonight			1
if @entity15 can land saturday 's $ 1million @entity18 , her success will be credited to @entity6 trainer @entity19			1
but the four - year - old ’s success will have its foundations firmly rooted in @entity24 all - weather racing			1
@entity26 exercises in preparation for the @entity28 , which has $ 1m prize money the filly was acquired by @entity0 for @entity31 and is trained by @entity19 she looked a decent but relatively modest performer when acquired for @entity6 owner @entity31 by @entity0 to inject some @entity7 blood into his @entity36 operation			1
but before she shipped out to the @entity37 she emphatically lifted the £ 91,000 first prize in the @entity39 ’ & @entity41 ’ @entity40 at the inaugural @entity42 staged on @entity43 at @entity44			2
@entity0 , whose brother @entity45 is @entity46 ’s racing manager , said : ‘ after we got her she started improving and after her second start for me i told @entity31 we should qualify her for this race			2
’ since being sent across the @entity50 , @entity26 has won both her races , including a @entity54 race at @entity55			1
both of those races were on synthetic surfaces similar to those she raced on in @entity24			2
tomorrow ’s race will be her first on traditional @entity61 but @entity0 is hopeful she can overcome that obstacle			2
@entity0 added : ‘ she has been at @entity14 for the last seven weeks			1
@entity19 is very pleased with her			2
she has done a lot of work on the dirt with her jockey @entity69 riding her and the vibes are positive			1
‘ @entity71 is a funny race			0
it is over seven furlongs and all @entity26 ’s wins in @entity24 have been over that distance			1
there are others in it who are six - furlong horses stepping up or milers dropping back			0
’ @entity26 ’s is 10 - 1 shot and @entity0 is hoping the galloping advert will bring him fresh @entity6 clients			1
@entity0 revealed they are very positive about @entity26 's condition , saying she has been training well @entity7 will be hoping for a bright start to the @entity11 on friday night			1
the challenge for the @entity91 is headed by @entity93 - trained @entity92 but @entity94 has had to withdraw his @entity96 winner @entity95 because the colt has a sore foot			0
@entity94 said : ‘ he worked and moved really well this morning and i was growing in confidence about his chances			0
unfortunately , that confidence did not last long as he was found to have a sore foot when he returned back to the barn and i had to make the decision to scratch him			0
’ @entity95 ’s absence has created a slot in the line - up for @entity111 - trained @entity110 , who had been on stand - by as first reserve			0
he will be ridden by @entity114			2
@entity116 ’s @entity115 has the form to go close in the @entity39 ’ turf but from wide stall will need an inspired @entity121 ride to succeed			0
@entity123 ’s @entity122 ( @entity124 ) is better placed in stall two			0
the organisers of the @entity127 could not wish for a better advert than @entity129			0
it was day one of the second year of the programme at @entity44 yesterday when @entity133 ’s @entity132 ( @entity134 ) landed the @entity135 , a @entity136 to @entity137 day			0
innovations this year are qualifying races in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 and a new three - year - old sprint category			0
trainer @entity144 landed his fifth @entity146 race of the season when @entity148 landed the @entity149 at @entity150 under jockey @entity151 .			0

@entity28 gets under way on friday at @entity14
