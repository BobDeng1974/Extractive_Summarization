by @entity1 reporter published : 11:41 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 11:45 est , 9 november 2012 @entity3 is to close most of its call centres with the loss of hundreds of nursing and other jobs , union leaders said today			1
@entity8 said 24 out of 30 sites will close at the service , which employs 1,500 frontline nursing and other professional staff			1
@entity13 , @entity8 ’s convenor at @entity3 , said : ' hundreds of dedicated nursing and @entity3 professionals are to be made redundant at a huge cost , when their skills could be used within the new @entity20 service if only the @entity21 took some decisive action			1
' @entity3 ( left ) is gradually to be replaced by the nhs 111 service ( promoted right ) , for non-emergency medical advice in @entity25 national officer @entity26 said : ' the secretary of state for health should step in and stop this disaster immediately			1
we need action and we need it now			0
' axing dedicated hard - working nurses is never a good idea at any time , but this will directly impact on patient care			0
there is no doubt that patients will suffer as a result of this move			0
' @entity8 said large centres in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 were among those set to close			2
' given that many of these @entity3 call centres are in areas of high unemployment there are very real fears for the staff ’s future job prospects			1
' the government spending millions on making nurses and @entity3 professionals redundant at a time when the @entity3 is under great strain is truly scandalous , ' said a union spokesman			2
an @entity3 spokeswoman said the company had been bidding for contracts across @entity25 to provide the @entity3 service , which is used when a patient needs medical help but it is not a 999 emergency			1
the organisation has been awarded contracts to provide the @entity3 111 services for 34 per cent of the population in @entity25			1
she said the 111 service will be delivered from six of its 30 call centres			1
' this does not necessarily mean we will be closing the other sites , ' she said			0
the organisation is waiting for some decisions by the @entity83 before the future of the other centres will be decided , she added			1
dr @entity86 from the @entity87 said : ' plans to replace @entity3 with 111 are a mistake and will result in nothing more than a pale shadow of what @entity3 is ' every year , @entity3 answers 4.2 million calls for health advice and information for patients in @entity25			2
healthcare professionals , nurses , and dental advisers give expert information and advice over the phone and are available 365 days a year			0
@entity103 , @entity3 chief executive , said : ' we have not confirmed that any sites are closing			2
at this stage we have confirmed which sites we will be keeping open to deliver @entity3 111 in the areas where we have been commissioned to provide the service			1
' the sites are : @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
home working will be an option for some of our nurses as an alternative to working from a site			0
' the future of other @entity3 sites has not been decided			1
we are in discussion with the @entity21 and the @entity83 about the future of other non- 111 services that we could be asked to deliver before making decisions			0
' dr @entity86 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity87 , said : ' for a while we have said that the plans to replace @entity3 with 111 are a mistake and will result in nothing more than a pale shadow of what @entity3 is			2
' we have always been huge supporters of @entity3 and believe it has matured into a highly effective service providing tried and tested quality advice			2
' everyone must be made aware that the government is effectively abolishing this vital service purely on a cost cutting basis			0
this is a foolish and ill conceived decision			0
' @entity3 confirmed that centres in @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity111 , @entity145 , will be used to provide the @entity3 service			1
one of three sites in @entity116 will also be used , but it has not been confirmed whether it will be the site in @entity149 , the @entity151 office , or the centre at @entity3 's head office in @entity154 , east @entity116			0
the future of the following sites are uncertain : @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity45 , @entity159 , @entity48 , @entity44 , @entity42 , @entity160 , @entity43 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity46 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity47 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity41 , @entity170 in @entity171 , and @entity172 .			0
