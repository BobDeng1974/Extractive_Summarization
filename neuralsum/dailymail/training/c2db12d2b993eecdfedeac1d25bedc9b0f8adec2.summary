we are both really happy			1
’ new love : @entity1 and @entity4 have started a new relationship @entity1 and the television producer became close when they met on the set of the @entity5 x factor in june 2010			1
just one month earlier , news of @entity1 ’s affair with backing dancer @entity23 had broken , putting a huge strain on the singer ’s marriage			1
and while his wife @entity27 spent that summer in @entity5 with the couple ’s three children , @entity30 , 13 , @entity31 , 11 , and @entity32 , seven , @entity1 and @entity11 remained close friends			1
a source on the show said : ‘ @entity1 went on the set , storm went			1
‘ they hung out together all the time			1
‘ after the show , @entity1 would go back and meet @entity27 and the children			1
salvage attempt : @entity1 and his ex-wife @entity27 at @entity41 in @entity42 in october 2010 ‘ but on the set , @entity1 and storm just hung out and chatted and laughed			1
’ in fact , the amount of time they spent together during filming of the first series sparked speculation as to the nature of their relationship			2
then in november , storm suddenly left the show to join the production team at @entity59			2
she worked on that programme for 10 months and last october she was hired as a producer on @entity63 of @entity5 , a rival show to @entity1 ’s @entity20			2
‘ @entity1 was definitely sad to see her go , ’ added the source			2
storm on her wedding day in 2009 , left , and indulging her sweet tooth - a habit she is said to share with @entity1 ‘ but they kept in touch , with @entity11 sending him notes on his performance and just meeting for coffee			2
’ when the @entity20 wrapped in january 2011 and @entity1 returned to @entity75 , the pair kept in contact			2
at the time , @entity1 and @entity27 were still trying to save their marriage for the sake of the children			2
but sources believe that as early as march 2011 the couple were struggling to put the @entity84 affair behind them.at the same time , @entity1 and @entity11 were constantly in touch through phone calls , texts and emails			0
and that march she made the trip from @entity42 to @entity91 to party with @entity1 for his birthday			0
however , when @entity1 realised that @entity27 was also attending the @entity91 party , @entity11 decided not to attend the bash , opting instead to meet @entity1 the day after he had celebrated on march 3			0
‘ it was just decided that @entity27 was making the effort to be there for @entity1 and it would n’t be fair to have storm there as well , ’ said a band source			0
family unit : @entity1 has three children with his estranged wife although both seemed to have moved on with new loves ‘ the rest of @entity106 was there as well and it just made sense not to have an @entity5 blonde girl sitting with him when @entity27 walked in			1
as far as i know , @entity27 was not aware of @entity1 ’s friendship with @entity11			0
’ by june 2011 , it became clear that the differences between @entity1 and @entity27 were irreconcilable and the couple began to accept that their marriage was over for good			0
by february 2012 , @entity27 had finally put the affair behind her and had begun to date cameraman @entity117			0
a friend of @entity1 ’s new partner said : ‘ they have loads in common – both are into keeping fit , music , good food and wine – and there is a real spark between them			0
for the first time in months , @entity1 has a real spring in his step and although they ’re still in the early stages , both think this could be something long term			0
’ a friend of @entity11 ’s added : ‘ those close to @entity11 have known for some time about her and @entity1 , and everyone ’s delighted for her			1
’ the @entity142 star announced the separation from his wife of 14 years just five months ago			1
@entity27 is said to have been irreparably heartbroken by the revelations that her husband had cheated			0
news of @entity1 ’s affair with backing dancer @entity23 emerged two years ago when his wife found incriminating text messages on a secret mobile phone			0
the couple attempted to work through their problems but finally announced their divorce in april			0
