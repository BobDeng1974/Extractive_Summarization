the @entity0 is awarded to the world ’s best player in @entity3 on monday but i am far more interested in who is named coach of the year			2
@entity8 , for securing @entity10 ’s 10th @entity9 , and @entity11 winner @entity7 will have their supporters but if it was down to me , the prize would go to the third man on the shortlist — @entity16			1
his work with @entity18 , which was crowned by winning @entity19 last season , has been unbelievable for the past three years and i watched in awe again on wednesday night when he inspired his side in the @entity23 to a third consecutive victory over @entity10			1
@entity16 has been nominated for coach of the year at @entity27 's awards in @entity3 on monday @entity16 is one of three finalists after guiding @entity18 to the @entity19 title in 2014 the @entity31 boss broke the @entity33 and @entity10 dominance to win the @entity35 title a 2 - 0 victory over rivals real on wednesday was @entity18 's third straight @entity10 derby win that is three straight derby wins after losing the @entity9 final to their neighbours			1
you would have thought losing in @entity45 would have had a psychological impact on @entity47 but nothing could be further from the truth			0
@entity16 is the type of manager you would run through a brick wall for — i ’d even come out of retirement for him ! — and you can see his squad have total belief in him			2
he would be a magnificent addition to our game			0
in some ways , @entity47 remind me of the @entity64 sides i played for under @entity65 and @entity66			0
we might not have been the easiest on the eye but we had absolute belief that wherever we went in @entity69 we would get a result			0
@entity16 has given that to @entity47			0
@entity18 were denied @entity9 glory as well after losing to @entity10 in the final in @entity45 @entity74 @entity8 is another finalist for coach of the year after his exploits with @entity10 @entity7 guided his @entity78 team to @entity11 glory in @entity80 this summer			1

@entity16 is one of three finalists for @entity27 's coach of the year
@entity8 and @entity85 also named as finalists
@entity16 guided @entity18 to the @entity19 title in may
