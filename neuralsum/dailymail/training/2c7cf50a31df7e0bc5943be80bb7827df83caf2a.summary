two bad decisions and with them @entity1 lost the @entity3			1
for one , they could whinge at @entity5 , the referee who in an apparent moment of pre-season complacency denied them a clear penalty			0
for the other , they can only look at themselves for reasons why a £ 53million striker was left unmarked at a set - piece			2
@entity15 rarely needs help in front of goal , but considering his first - half header was his first goal since his knee injury in january the @entity23 striker probably wo n’t mind			1
subs : @entity60 , @entity78 , @entity73 , @entity39 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81			2
booked : @entity72 , @entity82 @entity23 : @entity83 ; @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ( @entity87 85 ) , @entity88 ; @entity89 , @entity90 ; @entity91 , @entity92 ( @entity93 58 ) , @entity94 ( @entity95 72 ) ; @entity15 ( @entity96 58 )			1
subs : @entity95 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103			0
goal : @entity15 the goal gave @entity106 the branded trinket , their 3 - 1 win over @entity109 earlier in the day making the difference , along with @entity5 ’s highly questionable call in the second half of @entity1 ’s match			1
@entity39 had raced clear with 10 minutes still to play when @entity23 keeper @entity83 raced off his line and clattered him			1
@entity39 was possibly offside when he made his run , but was certainly inside the area when the foul occurred			1
@entity5 gave a yellow card and a free - kick after advice from his assistant ; strange calls even for summer football			1
not that it matters , especially			0
this , like all pre-season matches , was about learning			0
in that context , @entity128 offered what looked like a significant clue concerning the line - up of his side for the @entity134 against @entity135 , with left back @entity136 perhaps the only player to come in			1
@entity1 handed a start to £ 10m signing @entity64 at right back , indicating again that @entity139 is being groomed for a role at centre - half			1
the pair of them , £ 22m worth of recruitments , were solid , particularly the latter			0
touch : @entity15 controls the ball and shields it from @entity1 's young new signing @entity139 @entity148 impressed by @entity66 a kick in the teeth : @entity26 puts his head where it hurts and is met by @entity86 's boot acrobatic attempt : @entity71 tries an overhead kick as @entity1 went in search of an equaliser midfield battle : @entity75 tussles with @entity90 @entity160 attraction : @entity1 's marquee signing @entity26 runs at @entity86 stop right there : former @entity163 defender @entity86 ( left ) halts @entity74 's run with a sliding tackle aerial duel : @entity15 gets his head to the ball before another @entity169 , the @entity170 that 's your lot : @entity26 went off in the second half @entity66 impressed with his tackling and positioning , even if he did balloon one of @entity1 ’s best early chances over the bar from a @entity76 corner			1
he certainly has the composure to play in the middle			0
@entity64 , meanwhile , has evidently developed an understanding with @entity26 , getting forward often to support and feed the attacker in whom so much is expected			2
if there is a flaw in @entity64 ’s make - up then perhaps it comes in his willingness to run back after those excursions into the opposition half			2
@entity128 likes his full - backs to advance , but what goes up must come down			0
@entity64 ’s failure to follow such orders led directly to @entity94 being free to shoot after 25 minutes			0
for @entity26 , there were no such concerns , the @entity199 a ball of energy and movement			2
his passing is occasionally fantastic ; his work rate frantic			0
at various stages he rotated through @entity1 ’s attacking positions and was probably their most dangerous player in each , certainly in the middle			0
after 10 minutes , his 40 - yard cross-field pass was half a yard away from putting @entity74 clean through			0
that chance was cut out by a lunge from @entity213 , the captain of a side that probably deserved to lead at half - time			0
the manner in which @entity23 went ahead was a little strange to those who might a £ 53m talent to be marked at a set - piece			1
alas , @entity15 was left unattended when @entity92 swung over a free - kick – conceded a little needlessly by @entity72 - and the striker headed past @entity63			1
@entity1 nearly levelled after the restart when @entity76 ’s little flick put @entity72 through , but @entity41 pulled off an excellent reflex save			0
and @entity26 fired just wide shortly after the hour			0
@entity39 then had his shout ignored for a penalty and @entity23 gave @entity106 the cup			1
keeping him under pressure : @entity74 challenges @entity23 goalkeeper @entity41 composed : @entity66 ( left ) takes the ball away from @entity23 's @entity90 getting stuck in : @entity64 ( left ) gets tight to @entity90 during the first half keen to impress : @entity72 scampers across the ground during the clash with @entity23			2

@entity15 heads home in the first half to win the match for @entity23
@entity1 striker @entity39 brought down in the area but free - kick given
@entity26 started for the @entity241 at the @entity242
@entity106 finish top of group and win the @entity3
@entity1 face @entity135 in the @entity134 next *sunday*
