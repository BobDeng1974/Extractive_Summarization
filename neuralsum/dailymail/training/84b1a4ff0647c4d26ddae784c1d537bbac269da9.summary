and now scientists say it ’s the time you spend rather than the speed you go			0
they found that doing at least one to two hours a day was associated with reduced stroke risk in the over- 60s			2
but strenuous ‘ power walks ’ were not required			1
some 3,435 healthy men aged 60 to 80 were questioned about the distance they walked each week and their usual pace			2
the study showed that those who went for eight to 14 hours a week were a third less likely to have a stroke than those who walked less than three hours			2
for men walking more than 22 hours a week , the risk was two thirds lower , according to the study published in the @entity28 journal @entity29			1
‘ if you took 1,000 men who usually walk eight to 14 hours per week and followed them for ten years , on average they would have 55 strokes , compared with 80 for the group who only walk zero to three hours a week , ’ said researcher dr @entity30 of @entity31			1
‘ the total time spent walking was more consistently protective against stroke than pace ; overall it seemed that accumulating more time walking was most beneficial			0
our findings suggest that regular walking could be an important part of stroke prevention strategies in older people			0
’ teams found that doing at least one to two hours a day was associated with reduced stroke risk in the over- 60s			1
but strenuous ' power walks ' were not required each year around 152,000 people have strokes in the @entity56 , which can be fatal or disabling			1
dr @entity57 , from the @entity58 , which part - funded the study , said : ' whatever your age it ’s important to stay active every day			0
‘ this research suggests a daily walk could help to reduce stroke risk and is further evidence that regular exercise – even a daily stroll in the park – can be an effective way to keep healthy			0

for men walking more than 22 hours a week , risk is two thirds lower
but strenuous ‘ power walks ’ were not required , teams said
around 152,000 people have strokes in @entity56 a year , which can be fatal
