there appear to be noises that another @entity2 is set to arrive in the @entity3 ? are we starting a colony ? calm down			0
but yes , a trio of @entity8 clubs led by @entity9 are monitoring @entity10 , @entity11 ’s 18 - year - old forward as he develops his game in the @entity13			1
@entity14 and @entity15 are also said to admire him			2
why is he on the radar of these clubs ? having impressed at various age levels he burst to prominence with a hat - trick against @entity38 in august last season aged just 17 years and 196 days			1
it made him the youngest player to score three goals in a game in the history of the @entity47 top - flight			1
his strikes were all high quality too ; his first a left - foot shot arrowed in off the bar , his second a well - placed effort from distance , his third a precise curler from his right boot after a smart dribble			0
three s the magic number : the @entity11 forward celebrates scoring a hat - trick against @entity38 some statement			1
did it prompt international recognition ? yes , @entity63 called him up for @entity65 and he made his debut in the @entity68 qualifier against @entity69 last october , coming on as a 78th minute substitute for @entity72 ’s @entity71			2
the appearance ended speculation about which country he would represent given his parents are @entity77			0
but like @entity78 , @entity10 chose the country of his birth			0
that begs the question – where was he born and how did he come to @entity83 so young ? @entity10 was born in @entity84 , and represented @entity85 until moving to @entity11 at the tender age of 12 to join their academy			1
take a bow : @entity10 was given his @entity65 debut against wales in october 2013 so what is his style and what are his stats ? standing at under 5ft 5in tall , @entity10 has been compared to @entity95 for bustling running and sharp shooting			1
he is extremely quick and possesses rapid acceleration as well as close ball control skills			0
he likes to run at players , cut in from the wings , and strike with either foot			0
he impressed on his debut for @entity11 , a @entity105 qualifier against @entity2 club @entity106 , and scored in the second leg			0
he has been used intermittently since his breakthrough as he progresses , with three goals in 16 @entity13 appearances			0
across various youth levels for @entity65 his return is 18 goals in 26 games			2
low centre of gravity : the 18 - year - old has been likened to @entity118 striker @entity95			1

@entity10 is *attracting* interest from @entity9 , @entity15 and @entity14
@entity11 teenager became youngest player to score a hat - trick in the @entity13 in game against @entity38
@entity77 born 18 - year - old won his first @entity65 *cap* in october 2013
@entity10 has been likened to @entity118 forward @entity95
