it 's such a crying shame that only now are people starting to realise what a vital player @entity2 is to @entity4			1
when captain @entity5 said after the draw in @entity7 on tuesday that @entity2 was the ' best player on the pitch by a mile ' , and that he ' dictated the game ' he summed up what @entity4 have been missing since he signed for @entity12 in 2006			1
successive @entity4 managers kept beating themselves up trying to solve the @entity16 / @entity15 conundrum in midfield , but ironically it was a @entity18 who presented the answer to them			1
@entity2 gets ahead of @entity7 striker @entity21 during tuesday night 's friendly in @entity22 @entity2 applauds the travelling @entity4 supporters in @entity22 after winning his 33rd cap against @entity7 for all @entity2 's achievements with @entity12 , he has been consistently overlooked by @entity4 sir @entity26 signed @entity2 for £ 18million , trusted him in midfield , and @entity12 dominated domestically and even became champions of @entity28 in an era when @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 were taking their place in history as one of the greatest ever club sides			1
that 's why i firmly believe that had @entity2 been a regular in @entity4 's midfield for the past 10 years , we would have won a major tournament in that time			1
you can disagree , but you can not prove me wrong			0
@entity2 has a 100 per cent record with @entity4 at the @entity44			1
he 's only ever played in one game at the tournament , and @entity4 won it 1 - 0 against @entity47 in the round of 16 in 2006			1
@entity50 dropped him for the next game , the quarter - final against @entity53 , and @entity4 went out			1
what followed is inexplicable : from october 2006 through to september 2012 @entity2 did n't play a single meaningful competitive game for @entity4			1
sir @entity26 realised the abilities that @entity2 could bring to his @entity12 team @entity2 gets stuck in to @entity31 during the @entity59 final with @entity32 in @entity60 @entity2 has played in 377 matches for @entity12 in his nine seasons with the club @entity2 ( right ) has lifted the @entity65 trophy on five occasions at @entity67 @entity65 ( 5 ) : 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 @entity68 ( 1 ) : 2009 - 10 @entity69 ( 5 ) : 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 , 2013 @entity70 ( 1 ) : 2007 - 08 @entity71 ( 1 ) : 2008 in that same time period @entity2 won four @entity65 titles , a @entity59 , and played in two other @entity59 finals			1
@entity4 lumbered and stumbled on with the likes of @entity75 ( 21 caps ) , @entity77 ( 18 ) and @entity78 ( an incredible 53 ) all lucky to get the number of caps they did			2
sir @entity26 , arguably the greatest manager of all time , picked @entity2			2
but @entity83 and @entity84 did not			0
who called it right ? @entity26 kept winning trophies , but @entity88 failed to qualify for the 2008 @entity89 , while @entity84 's 2010 @entity44 campaign in @entity91 was lifeless worse still , @entity84 took @entity2 to that tournament , but then did n't give him a single minute on the pitch			1
all i remember of @entity4 in @entity91 was that we simply could not keep the ball			2
we could n't pass to each other			0
that 's what @entity2 brings to a team			2
@entity84 did n't even take time to sit down and explain to @entity2 why he was being left out despite the shambles being played out by the players he did pick			2
@entity2 celebrates his recent goal for @entity12 against @entity105 at @entity67 @entity2 celebrates with @entity5 after scoring a vital goal for @entity12 at @entity107 in may 2009 @entity2 has n't scored too many goals during his career but his stunner against @entity111 in 2007 stands out @entity2 's goal set @entity12 on their way to a 7 - 1 victory that registers amongst their great @entity116 nights @entity2 must have been wondering why he 'd bothered leaving his wife and newborn son to go to the other side of the world and watch that horrible mess			1
@entity123 told me this about @entity2 : ' the players that play with him love him , and sir @entity26 has picked him in probably 95 per cent of games during the most successful period of @entity12 's history			1
' what he does is n't ' wow ' , it 's largely unseen stuff , but a lot of midfielders do n't do it			0
' @entity2 is capable of the spectacular , take a look at this pass against @entity138 from 2013			2
in @entity22 on tuesday , @entity139 and @entity140 caught the eye with their impact , but they were afforded the freedom to run with the ball , take risks and be adventurous because @entity2 was so disciplined behind them			1
critics continue with their tired old nonsense about how he is n't quick enough , and he 's not spectacular , or he does n't score goals			0
these criticisms are so @entity153 , the kind of dinosaur thinking that 's been holding our game back all these years			0
two years ago i went to @entity12 's training ground to interview @entity2			1
i asked him about the job he does for the team , his role			0
@entity2 celebrates with @entity163 ( left ) and @entity164 after scoring against @entity165 last season @entity2 has won five @entity65 titles at @entity12 - the last of which came in 2013 @entity2 jumps for joy after @entity163 scored a last - minute free - kick at @entity171 in 2012 @entity2 was never able to convince @entity4 manager @entity84 to give him a regular starting berth @entity2 was handed his @entity4 debut back in 2001 when @entity174 were beaten 4 - 0 at @entity175 in @entity176 @entity2 shadows @entity177 during @entity4 's ill - fated @entity179 quarter - final in 2012 he put it very simply : ' i 'm just there to help the defence and act as extra cover for them really , to stop the supply into opposition front players			1
' at the same time to service our attackers and wide men ; it 's my job to keep the flow of service as much as possible to them and let them create and score goals			0
' a few weeks later he won his fifth title in seven years at @entity67			2
not bad for someone who is criticised for not being spectacular			0
his best performance in an @entity4 shirt came in @entity201 in 2008 when @entity4 won 2 - 1			1
he was man of the match and controlled the midfield			0
that was a few months after @entity205 had reached the @entity179 final			0
forget player - for - player comparisons for a moment and look at the role he plays in the team			0
it 's similar to what @entity213 did for @entity215 when they won a @entity44 and a @entity179			0
and before him @entity217 did the same job in that @entity215 midfield			0
@entity2 's finest hour came in 2008 as @entity4 defeated @entity205 2 - 1 in @entity201 's @entity222 @entity2 performs a similar role to @entity215 's holding midfielder @entity213 @entity217 has also performed the @entity2 role for the @entity227 team with great success @entity2 may not quite be at the level of @entity7 's @entity230 but he 's the closest @entity4 have got those two winners have over 100 caps between them , and only three goals			1
it was n't their job to score			0
neither were quick , but they did n't need to be			0
in that position they read the game , looked after the ball , and got the team going the other way			0
these players are not famous for their tackling prowess either			0
they usually get to the ball before they need to dive into a challenge			0
and then there 's @entity230			0
it would be hard to make a case to say @entity2 is as good as @entity230 , but he is certainly the closest this country can offer			2
which is why watching @entity4 struggle to deal with him at the last @entity44 made @entity254 's decision to leave @entity2 at home bewildering			1
it looks like @entity254 has come to his senses on that one			2
what a shame previous @entity4 managers could n't see what sir @entity26 was showing them			1
it was n't just @entity26 who could see it : at the end of the 2012 - 13 season @entity263 said @entity2 was his player of the year : ' he is a quality passer			2
he could play for @entity32 , he would be perfectly suited to their game			0
@entity267 has quickly come to appreciate @entity2 since arriving at @entity12 @entity2 's performances against @entity269 have drawn praise from the @entity272 boss @entity263 ' i think @entity2 is an underrated player in @entity4 and sometimes not only should the goalscorer be rewarded but also the real players at the heart of the game			1
' and @entity267 has learned in a short space of time at @entity67 just how important @entity2 is			2
have a look at @entity12 's season – the better runs for the team have come when @entity2 has been fit			1
@entity284 said recently : ' @entity2 is more or less a trainer - coach			2
he is also willing to talk about shapes and systems			0
' @entity284 has worked with some truly brilliant footballers in his career , that 's high praise indeed for @entity2			2
on the pitch , in that key position in central midfield , @entity2 has that football intelligence and spatial awareness that so few players possess			0
sir @entity26 made mistakes , but he did n't keep making the same mistake for seven successive seasons			0
while @entity12 were winning with him , @entity4 were losing without him			1
would @entity4 have won the @entity301 , or a @entity44 with @entity2 in the team ? i think so			1
i know for certain we would have had a much better chance .			0

@entity2 made just his 33rd appearance for @entity4 in @entity7 on tuesday
the midfielder has been overlooked by a succession of @entity4 managers
this is despite being the main man at @entity12 for years
@entity254 seems to have realised the importance of @entity2
but @entity4 may have won a major tournament with him in the side
