it looks like a giant tornado is causing mayhem in the sky - but this image is simply the reflection of a river running through a mine			2
to create this spectacular moment , photographer @entity8 went to the @entity11 's mining zone along the @entity11 river in @entity13 , @entity14			1
a site along the river has been used for mining for centuries and that is why the colours in the photographs are so bright and vivid			2
twisted weather : although the image appears to show a flame - red twister , it is actually the deep red hue of @entity14 's @entity11 river firestorm : centuries of mining have created the incredibly rich colours in the water other images of the bright red river bed show what appears to be a sky cracked with fiery lightning and orange - hued clouds			1
it was mined for copper , silver and gold , and now the water is very acidic - resulting in a deep reddish hue because of the dissolved iron			0
@entity8 , from @entity46 in @entity14 , admits this was n't the first time he visited the special place			1
the 59 - year - old said : ' i have been to this beautiful place several times to take photographs , but this is my most memorable set of pictures			0
electric : this vibrant image looks like an ethereal flame - coloured lightning storm , complete with clouds heat : this is not lava , pouring out from a fissure beneath the sea , but a vein of dissolved iron ore beneath a river ' the photographs show the bright colours of the bed - i have never seen it so vibrant before			1
' the texture of the river was mind - blowing , the bright colours and the reflection of the river was amazing to see			0
" he added : ' the colour of the river depends on the time , hour of the day , month of the year and even the level of water			0
river of time : the area has been mined for more than 5,000 years by a variety of different civilizations ' if the level of water is high , the bottom is not seen and therefore the colour is dimmer and the photographs are n't great			0
' the area around the @entity11 has been mined since ancient times			1
in approximately 3,000 @entity96 , @entity94 and @entity95 began mining the site , followed by the @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102			0
after a period of abandonment , the mines were rediscovered in 1556 and the @entity14 government began operating them once again in 1724			2
red river : a landscape of an abandoned tin mining operation on the @entity11 in @entity14 pool of blood : the photographer said : ' the colour of the river depends on the time , hour of the day , month of the year and even the level of water '			1

images that appear to show fiery twisters are actually river reflections
