@entity1 users are inadvertently revealing their location in updates on the social media channel , an expert claims			0
a study that sampled more than 15 million tweets , found that one in five updates give away a user 's whereabouts , which could present unwelcome opportunities for criminals			1
the research provides important factual data for a growing conversation about online privacy and third - party commercial or government use of geo - tagged information			1
this heat map shows the density of all tweets during the study collection period where the location was identifiable through ambient information or direct sharing the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) study , which was published in the @entity30 of @entity31 used a custom - built app to examine how many people willingly and accidentally publicise their presence on @entity1			1
lead author @entity35 , a graduate student in the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) online master 's program at @entity28 , said : ' i 'm a pretty private person , and i wish others would be more cautious with the types of information they share			1
' ' there are all sorts of information that can be gleaned from things outside of the tweet itself			0
' @entity1 has approximately 500 million active users , who are expected to tweet 72 billion times in 2013			0
reports have shown that about 6 per cent of users opt - in to allow the platform to broadcast their location with every tweet			2
but that 's only part of the footprint @entity1 users leave , and even users who do not willingly ' tag ' their location , they may be inadvertently revealing where they are , the study shows			2
@entity1 has approximately 500 million active users , who are expected to tweet 72 billion times in 2013			0
reports have shown that about 6 per cent of users opt - in to allow the platform to broadcast their location with every tweet to get a fuller sense of what publicly accessible data might reveal about @entity1 users , mr @entity35 developed an app called @entity72 , to analyse the metadata collected by @entity1 , including details about the user 's hometown , time zone and language			1
the data , generated by @entity1 users and publicly available through @entity1 's application programming interface ( @entity82 ) and @entity83 's @entity82 , was then processed by a software program , which mapped and analysed the data , searching for trends			2
during the one - week sampling period of the study , roughly 20 per cent of the tweets collected showed the user 's location to an accuracy of street level or better			1
many @entity1 users divulged their physical location directly through active location monitoring or gps coordinates			0
but another two per cent of all tweets – equating to about 4.4 million tweets a day – provided so - called ' ambient ' location data , where the user might not be aware that they are divulging their location			2
mr @entity35 said : ' the downside is that mining this kind of information can also provide opportunities for criminal misuse of data			1
' my intent is to educate social media users and inform the public about their privacy			0
' an increasing number of social media platforms ( pictured ) allow users to share their location			0
during the one - week sampling period of the study , roughly 20 per cent of the tweets collected showed the user 's location to an accuracy of street level or better in addition to being a graduate student at @entity28 , @entity35 works for a company that builds geographic information systems for the federal government			1
he initially developed @entity72 as part of a project for a course taught by @entity132 , associate professor of spatial sciences , who said the app ' will help create an awareness among the general population about the information they divulge			0
' @entity35 is a self - described ' conservative ' @entity1 user , using the social media channel infrequently and has the privacy set to not share any location information about his tweets			1
still , in the course of doing this study , he turned @entity72 on his own account and was surprised at the specificity the application was able to find about his location , based on a hashtag he used about an academic conference			0
' this research has been fun and a little scary , ' he said .			0

a @entity155 scientist found 20 *%* of the tweets collected showed the user 's location to an accuracy of street level or better
research provides data for a growing conversation about online privacy and third - party commercial or government use of geo - tagged information
the @entity28 study warned the information can provide opportunities for criminal misuse of data
