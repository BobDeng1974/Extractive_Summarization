community leaders in the three northeastern villages claimed the military failed to intervene , even though it was warned an attack was imminent			0
massacre : militants dressed as soldiers rounded up residents of three villagers in northeastern @entity23 province ( pictured in red ) as shot at them ' continuously for a very long time ' until all those gathered were dead a community leader who witnessed the killings on monday said residents of the @entity31 local government district , in @entity23 , pleaded for the military to send soldiers to protect the area			1
he said they had heard the @entity36 militants - who have taken over several villages in @entity5 - were about to attack , but help did n't arrive			2
after escaping the massacre and fleeing to @entity41 , @entity23 's state capital , he said : ' we all thought they were the soldiers that we earlier reported to that the insurgents might attack us			1
' ' then they begin to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all that gathered were all dead ' - community leader who escaped the massacre the militants arrived in @entity53 pickup trucks - commonly used by the military - and told the civilians they were soldiers ' and we are here to protect you all '			1
the tactic was the same used by @entity2 militants who kidnapped more than 300 girls from a school in the town of @entity63 on april 15 , prompting an international campaign whose supporters include the @entity67 first lady @entity66			1
after people gathered in the village centres on the militants ' orders , the witness said , ' they begin to shout ` @entity73 , @entity73 ' on top of their voices			2
' then they begin to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all that gathered were all dead			0
' the witness asked not to be named for fear for his safety			0
the killings happened on monday in the villages of @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85			2
they are in the @entity31 local government area , a regional political centre whose emir was killed in a @entity2 ambush on his convoy last week			0
horror : the militants told villagers they were there to protect them , the same tactics used to kidnap almost 300 schoolgirls ( pictured ) from another village in april			1
no photographs have yet emerged of the slaughter @entity2 's violence has forced more than 250,000 people to flee their homes since march last year , according to @entity5 's @entity104 ( @entity104 )			2
but a report yesterday warned the latest horrific attacks in the north east could still be the tip of the iceberg			1
the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) , based in @entity111 , said the unrest could spread rapidly to other countries			0
its director @entity114 said : ' as the government struggles to contain the group ’s southward spread towards @entity121 , questions to the future of regional stability have been raised which have weakened @entity5 ’s relations with @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
' the group is growing in its ambition , capability and reach , creating fears that it will become a regional destabilising force			2
' @entity131 , secretary general of the @entity132 , added : ' what we have learnt from past experiences of managing the humanitarian impact of armed groups , such as the @entity138 , is that speed is of the essence			0
' the longer such groups are allowed to continue these horrific abuses , the more visibility and notoriety they gain , the harder it becomes to control their spread and impact - they must be stopped , and they must be stopped now '			0
emirs are religious and traditional rulers who have been targeted for speaking out against @entity2 's extremism			2
@entity23 governor @entity152 traveled on saturday to @entity31 to pay his respects to the fallen emir and was quoted as saying it was a terrifying ride			1
' if i say i was not petrified travelling through that ... road to @entity31 i would be lying because that road had been designated a no - go area for about two months now due to the incessant attacks and killings that occur there , ' the governor was quoted as saying by @entity164			2
a local journalist who was in the convoy - escorted by 150 soldiers - counted at least 16 towns and villages that were deserted along the 85 mile route			0
the slaughter was confirmed by both @entity172 , a senator representing @entity23 and whose hometown is @entity31 , and by a top security official in @entity41 who insisted on anonymity because he is n't allowed to speak to the media			1
it took a few days for survivors to get word of the massacres to @entity41 , the provincial capital , because travel on the roads is extremely dangerous and phone connections are poor or nonexistent			1
the community leader was n't shot because ' i was going round to inform people that the soldiers had come and they wanted to address us , ' he said			0
as people were fleeing , other gunmen lurking outside the villages on motorcycles mowed them down , he said			0
militants of @entity2 , which wants to establish @entity194 state in @entity5 , have been taking over villages in the northeast , killing and terrorizing civilians and political leaders			1
the @entity194 fighters are making a comeback from a year - long military offensive which had been aimed at crushing them			0
the extreme @entity36 group , led by @entity204 ( pictured ) , has swept through northeastern @entity5 monday 's attacks have been among the deadliest so far			1
thousands of people have been killed in the five - year - old insurgency , more than 2,000 so far just this year , and an estimated 750,000 @entity5 have been driven from their homes			0
@entity5 's military has insisted that the big influx of troops and a year - old state of emergency in three states which gives them the power to detain suspects , take over buildings and lock down any area has the extremists on the run			1
but while @entity2 has mostly been pushed out of northeastern cities , militants have been seizing villages with thatched - roof huts in the semi-arid region where they once held sway			0
their black flags adorned with white @entity229 lettering have been hoisted above simple village buildings , making vast parts of @entity5 no - go areas for the military .			0

militants in @entity53 pickup trucks said they would protect villagers
tactics are the same employed by those who kidnapped 300 schoolgirls
but they then ' shot at villagers in @entity23 until all were wiped out '
it took three days for word of the massacre to reach the state capital
monday 's attacks in north east of the country are among deadliest so far
