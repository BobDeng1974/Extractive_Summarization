for many years now , a tiny corner of rural @entity1 has been purely football			2
past the @entity3 , throw a right at the roundabout , through the lights and you get to @entity8 , home – among other things – to the training grounds of @entity1 's two football clubs			1
take a five - iron and strike it well from @entity15 's northerly pitches and the chances are those picking the ball up will be wearing @entity20 blue			1
so close they could hardly escape each other even if they wanted to			2
today , however , it changes			2
@entity51 's players are turning their sports cars and their suvs east towards the previously neglected @entity1 suburbs of @entity55 and @entity56			1
here , opposite their own @entity57 , lies their new training ground			1
hailed – admittedly by @entity20 themselves – as one of the best sporting facilities in the world , the @entity29 has cost in the region of £ 200million to build , has 16 pitches , its own 7,000 - seater reserve stadium , an accommodation block and even a sixth - form college to serve its local community			1
and those are just the things they have told us about			2
@entity8 , it must be said , was somewhat different			1
@entity20 's home for more than a decade - they previously trained at the rather iconic @entity75 centre in @entity1 's inner - city – it did n't even have a security barrier for many years			1
instead it had a rather fierce looking @entity79 named ' @entity80 ' who spent his days peering at you from inside a one - man sentry booth decorated with @entity20 calendars , posters and gifts from the players			1
if he knew you , @entity80 would tell you his latest joke			2
if he did n't , he would probably scare the life out of you			2
city boss @entity90 ( right ) has already taken training at the new base ahead saturday 's @entity24 visit of @entity24 @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 ( left to right ) are put through their paces at the complex @entity104 and @entity20 no 1 @entity102 gets acquainted with the newly - laid turf during goalkeeping practice at the £ 200m training base this was @entity109 , though			1
things were different , then			2
the first manager i encountered there was @entity114			2
' @entity115 to meet you , i hate your paper , ' were his first words to me in the winter of 2001			2
back then the media used to walk round the back of the main building , up some rather fragile - looking stairs that always needed painting and in to a room that doubled up as an analysis ' suite ' – it had a round table and some chairs – when we were n't there			2
on a shelf on the side was a never ending supply of footballs and black marker pens			0
once a week the players would file past and sign			0
@entity114 was often late , usually because he had been playing head tennis with his coaches out the back			0
' do n't say i admitted that , ' he once said			0
' it will invalidate my medical insurance on my back			0
' in the @entity149 , the days of @entity20 stars like @entity148 , left , players were put through their paces on an athletics track at @entity152			1
here , the former @entity104 international is given tips by @entity157 @entity156 one - mile runner @entity155 after the @entity160 break in 1969 , @entity20 players were sent on a 30 - minute run at @entity162 to shed off any excess pounds @entity20 's former first - team training ground @entity75 is now used by the club 's academy for matches in those days , players such as @entity168 and @entity169 ruled the roost at @entity8 , waiting round the corner to fire footballs at team - mates emerging in to the complex 's wide open spaces from a changing block that looked rather like something out of the film @entity179			1
it was all very high school			0
@entity181 , meanwhile , used to use that area as his own private driving range , golf balls pinging high in to the distance from his driver			0
a very good golfer , maybe @entity181 was aiming at sir @entity45 across the other side of the hedge			0
@entity114 once made his exit from @entity8 under a blanket on the back seat of a car			1
his crime ? to make a joke about @entity197 and hub caps as he signed @entity168			0
the @entity200 newspaper sent reporters dressed in black curly wigs to ambush him			0
' @entity80 ' on security would have eaten them for his breakfast			0
as time passed , things changed			0
the essence of @entity8 never did , though			1
even to this day – when @entity20 had to erect a big , cold tent to host @entity211 press conferences – the throwback feel of the place remains			1
@entity214 liked to hold press conferences at 8am			0
i think it was a macho thing			0
the problem was that , as results faded , the media just stopped turning up			0
maybe that was the plan all along			0
the club 's younger ranks are put through their paces ahead of their friendly against @entity225 in september 2013 @entity20 entered a new era when @entity227 introduced a table to sit behind when he spoke to journalists at press conferences @entity227 made sure he knew everybody 's name at @entity8 during his time at @entity20 , and when he was sacked there were tears from some @entity227 , meanwhile , finally introduced a table to sit behind for press conferences			1
for @entity20 , that was progress			1
they loved @entity227 at @entity8 , especially the women			1
he knew everybody 's name			1
when it emerged that he paid for the £ 2,000 - a - night top - floor suite at @entity1 's @entity245 out of his own pocket every night , the @entity242 's legend only grew			1
@entity20 were n't bad on the field under @entity227 , either			1
when he was sacked – unjustly – they cried at @entity8			1
on his arrival , @entity248 did his best to tart things up a bit			0
he thought @entity8 was ' unfit for purpose ' and he was probably right			1
given that he had come from @entity254 , though , it said everything			0
@entity248 was unhappy with @entity20 's @entity8 training ground facilities upon his arrival from @entity254 @entity248 disliked the media getting too close so they built us a pre-fabricated hut just inside the entrance while money was spent on the dressing rooms , too			1
pretty soon , @entity80 on security was no more			0
someone did n't like his tattoos apparently			0
with the @entity268 money that soon arrived , @entity8 got new signage and some trees lining the driveway that were rumoured to cost £ 1,000 each			1
the training ground soon got @entity273 and @entity274 , too			2
@entity273 often used to cycle to work – with his faithful aide ' @entity276 ' driving behind him in case of ' emergencies ' – while the photographers that lined the public footpath nearby feasted on the punch - ups that , for a while , became part of the @entity20 story			1
i once suggested to one of @entity273 's coaches that the club just erect a big fence to protect the sessions from the lenses			1
' the council wo n't let us , ' he replied			0
' anyway , it would be cheaper if the players just stopped fighting			0
' @entity299 ( centre ) and @entity274 ( right ) get a telling off after coming to blows during a training session in december 2011 @entity303 ( left ) had to be restrained back by his @entity20 team - mates after his spat with @entity274 at @entity8 the maverick @entity307 forward ( left ) had to be led away by @entity34 ( right ) as things turned violent @entity273 ( left ) tries to laugh off the feud between @entity274 and @entity303 ( right ) after their fight former @entity20 boss @entity273 ( left ) came to blows with @entity274 ( right ) during a training session in january 2013 for a while the bad publicity was a problem for @entity20 but , on the whole , they were impressively sanguine			1
across the fence , @entity45 was paranoid about the secrecy of his training sessions , as indeed is @entity320 now			2
@entity20 , though , took a different view			1
on learning that one geeky fan was climbing a tree to view sessions through binoculaurs , they did n't set the dogs on him			0
instead they invited him inside for a guided tour and a meet - and - greet session			0
at the ' @entity331 ' i suspect things may be a little different			0
that 's what they call progress			2
if you want to spy on training this week , you may wish to hire a drone			2
@entity90 and his players will want for nothing , that 's for sure			2
the @entity24 is a different place now			0
they will still moan , though			0
for a start – from their homes in the @entity347 enclaves of @entity348 , @entity349 and @entity350 – the new place is a lot more difficult to get to			0
@entity354 @entity353 must make @entity274 behave - @entity273			0

@entity20 have hailed their new training complex as one of the best sporting facilities in the world
city have spent £ 200m on the @entity29 which includes 16 training pitches and accommodation
@entity29 is a *monumental* upgrade on the club 's former @entity8 base or the iconic @entity75
