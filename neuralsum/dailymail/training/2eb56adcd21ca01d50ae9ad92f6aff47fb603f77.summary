by @entity0 sitting in the stands watching @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ play netball on wednesday was @entity5			1
these @entity6 needed an icon and it is this man , the superstar holder of six olympic gold medals			1
he chewed gum , waved a @entity4 flag and talked with his little clique , including his attack - dog of an agent , @entity16 , and his friend from school , @entity19 , known as @entity20 , his man friday			1
@entity5 scurried off with his retinue after the match ended in a 50 - 42 loss to @entity24 , rushing past the reporters shouting one word : ‘ awesome			1
’ it was intended as his verdict on these games , a sentiment he retweeted in full charm - offensive mode later in the day			2
he derided the @entity6 as a ‘ bit s * * * ’ and said he was ‘ not really ’ having fun			1
those words , taken down in contemporaneous notes , appeared in the @entity49 on wednesday morning			1
the story prompted @entity5 to tweet : ‘ i ’m waking up to this nonsense … journalist please do n’t create lies to make headlines			1
’ @entity55 , chief executive of the @entity56 , told the daily press briefing : ‘ i think @entity5 ’s tweet has said it all			1
i take his word that it is lies			2
’ that seemed a touch complacent , dismissing a reputable publication so readily in deference to the event ’s leading man			2
loyal supporter : @entity5 , with his sunglasses on the back of his head , was on his feet to cheer on @entity4 's girls @entity38 ca n't be that bad ? @entity5 plays the tourist as he takes a quick snap inside the @entity37 all smiles : the six - time @entity79 champions did n't look too bothered by how 's * * * ' @entity38 might be to try to elicit some sort of clarification , i walked up to the spare seat next to @entity5 and introduced myself , reminding him that we had met briefly in @entity85 , @entity4 , a couple of years ago			1
before he had a chance to respond , security heavies manhandled me out of the way , one of them ripping my accreditation from around my neck			0
so much for the @entity94			0
this furore is extremely sensitive for the organisers because @entity5 has a multi-million pound deal with @entity98 , who are the ‘ official presenting partner of athletics ’			1
his image is plastered on @entity98 billboards across the city , including on the main road to @entity105 , where he is expected to run in the 4x100metres relay			1
on @entity108 , spectators have the chance to run against a hologram of @entity5 , courtesy of … @entity98			1
the gangly @entity4 is the man in demand			1
so when he arrived on saturday he was whisked straight to a press conference , where the fawning was on an industrial scale			0
the nadir was @entity118 , who works for @entity120 tv , saying she and her crew were there ‘ as fans ’ and wanted a selfie with him			0
@entity5 has posed for pictures with the @entity126 and @entity127 and prince @entity128 , as well as with the mascot , @entity130			2
he is the one athlete with global reach			0
no wonder the organisers were so keen to take his side on wednesday			0
however , this storm has not blown out			0
the journalist who broke the story , @entity137 , is ready to confront @entity5 about his denial			2
there is also outrage among @entity38 , a few of whom proposed a campaign to get punters to turn their backs on @entity5 in the stadium			1
@entity5 is everywhere : the @entity4 sprinter is plastered on @entity98 billboards across the city happy to please : @entity5 poses with @entity130 the mascot and children from @entity152 on saturday incredulous : @entity5 did not like it when a reporter questioned whether he would really run in @entity38 let 's hear it for the girls : @entity5 sends his best wishes to the team after their narrow @entity6 defeat a camera pointing the other way : @entity5 gets some snaps of the @entity4 girls in action on wednesday i am not sure many , if any , will do that			1
the crowds here have been warm to competitors from all 71 nations			0
a cavorting , bow - and - arrow shooting bolt up to his party tricks is unlikely to be a flop			0
one caveat : there remains some doubt about whether he will compete at all , especially if it is wet			2
he is overcoming injury and decided not to take part in the individual sprints			0
the cynics would say he is doing the bare minimum to honour his commitments to @entity98			2
between massages on wednesday , @entity5 was training			1
however , for part of the relay handover session @entity194 , the new @entity6 100m champion , was on the anchor leg that @entity5 is supposedly due to run			1
all smiles : bolt jokes around in training despite the storm surrounding his comments about @entity38 are you lookin ' at me ? bolt points at a photographer while wearing a camera round his neck in training speaking out : @entity194 , who won 100m gold , has also criticised the @entity211 if @entity5 did criticise the @entity6 , he would not be alone			1
take @entity194 , who said the food needed more seasoning and ‘ was n’t as good as @entity214 ’			2
@entity215 , who was sixth in the 100m , was similarly underwhelmed , saying : ‘ @entity5 ’s somewhere in the village			1
i hope he ’s having a better time than me			0
‘ the food ? @entity224			0
back in @entity4 it ’s not like this			2
i need to get me some clothes			0
’ actually , by @entity229 standards , it has been positively balmy			0
it was 27 degrees at the triathlon last week			0
there is plenty to enjoy			0
the streets have a carnival feel			0
the competition is keen , some of it of outstanding quality			0
they have sold 1.2million tickets , a roaring trade			0
@entity244 : an @entity246 health worker sprays insecticide outside the athletes ' village a month before the2010 games they are night - and - day compared to @entity244 ’s chaotic staging of this jamboree four years ago , made memorable by dengue fever , collapsing buildings , stray dogs , spit - infested sinks and the chief medical officer going down with typhoid			0
@entity5 missed those games because they came too late in the year to fit in with his schedule			2
take it from me , mr @entity5 , @entity38 2014 is a doddle and a joy .			1

@entity5 was reported as having called the @entity6 ' a bit s * * * ' in @entity49
@entity268 's fastest man has *rejected* the claims , calling them ' lies '
the 100m champion @entity194 has also criticised @entity38
@entity5 attended @entity4 women 's netball match during *downtime* in @entity38
@entity277 called the @entity6 ' awesome ' as he exited the @entity37
he has a multi-million pound deal with @entity6 sponsors @entity98
@entity5 's image is plastered on @entity98 billboards across the city of @entity38
@entity4 says he will compete in the 4x100m relay heats and likely final
however there are doubts over whether he will run if the track is wet
@entity194 has been running final relay leg - @entity5 's leg - in training
@entity38 have proposed turning their backs on @entity5 at @entity105
