it is extraordinary to me that , after @entity4 had graced lord ’s with a quite magnificent century , @entity3 captain @entity2 should dampen it all down by saying that he ’s not ready for @entity7			1
i would have no hesitation in throwing @entity4 into the first test at @entity5 ’s next week			2
this is yet another example of the sort of ‘ englishness ’ i ’ve seen time and time again where we concentrate on what someone can not do rather than what they can			0
and what @entity4 can do is absolutely fantastic			2
keeping tabs : @entity4 remains in the picture for @entity3 's @entity22 against @entity23 @entity24 : @entity4 scored a stunning ton at @entity26 first choice : sussex wicketkeeper @entity28 i once heard that @entity30 was not ready before he played @entity32 cricket			1
and they did n’t do too badly when they were given their chance			0
it was interesting to me that @entity39 almost distanced himself from @entity2 ’s comments and i sincerely hope that , if @entity28 is not fit , @entity3 have the courage of their convictions and get @entity4 into the team			1
i will give you two examples of wicketkeepers who were far from the finished article when they were given their chance in test cricket and went on to become the best their country have produced			0
sceptical : @entity3 captain @entity2 suggested that @entity4 was not ready for test cricket differing views : @entity39 said @entity4 remains in the picture for the @entity32 series there were question marks over @entity57 and @entity58 when @entity59 first picked them but they were not concerned about their rough edges , only that they had the potential to be very special performers			1
let ’s pick @entity4 .			0

@entity4 scored stunning century against @entity23 at @entity26

@entity39 says @entity4 is in the *mix* for @entity73 against @entity23
