to highlight the current @entity1 campaign , former @entity2 at the @entity3 , @entity4 , interviewed fellow prostate cancer sufferer , @entity7 legend @entity6			1
here , @entity4 reveals the illuminating results			1
there 's no discernible reluctance in @entity6 to recall one of the most embarrassing own goals in medical history			1
he whisks you back to 2003 and a doctor ’s consulting room			1
he ’s there at the behest of an anxious wife ; he ’s experiencing a troublesome ache in the lower abdomen			1
the biopsies have been performed and now , three agonising weeks later , the specialist delivers a sombre conclusion			1
the football legend has prostate cancer			1
law becomes a man in torment			1
embarrassing , or what ? former @entity30 striker @entity6 has opened up about being diagnosed with prostate cancer he delivers his recollections with a nervous laugh , but if he experienced humiliation that day , the scar is not evident			1
‘ i think that they thought in there that i ’d had a heart attack			1
because , as soon as he told me , i said i did n’t feel well			1
‘ hey , i was n’t laughing at the time			1
it ’s the @entity41 trait that we do n’t like hearing bad news			1
’ this interview with the @entity45 is being filmed courtesy of the @entity1 campaign			1
it pursues a certain logic : two @entity50 , who once lived less than a mile apart , locked into an insidious common denominator ; one victim of prostate cancer being quizzed by another			1
law is the epitome of punctuality			1
right on the appointed hour of noon , he steps into the capacious lounge of the @entity61			2
it ’s a holiday home to him , a place where he can be himself			2
the last time we met here he was in proletariat mode , demolishing sausage , egg and chips			2
@entity71 tends to blur memories , of course , but he ’s far more amenable now			2
at that time , he was about to launch another autobiography and figured that too much compliance with me would somehow inhibit sales			2
this time he is generosity itself			2
law ( left ) discusses being diagnosed with prostate cancer with @entity4 ( right ) now , he finds himself in a penalty box he never infiltrated in his playing days when he scored more than 250 goals , most of them for @entity30			1
this one delineates the grey area between life and death			2
it tends to focus minds			2
let ’s return , for one moment , to that display in the doctor ’s surgery and consider the paradoxes at work here			2
in spite of his apparently flimsy body structure , @entity6 was an authentic tough hombre who , for two decades , defied the various malignancies of footballers trying to break him physically and psychologically			1
ignoring the height and physical superiority of his tormentors , he ’d laugh in their faces when he was kicked , mentally consulting his diary and pencilling in a painful retribution			2
a few decades later , he keels over at a medical diagnosis			2
it scarcely equates with reason			2
mind you , he has always been two distinct and enigmatic personages			2
away from football , he remains one of the most self effacing men on the planet			0
whenever he attends an official function , for instance , he always asks a companion to accompany him to the toilet just in case he is claimed by hero - worshiping fans			1
he does n’t favour fuss			0
the pair have been treated for prostate cancer and the video encourages men to get involved with @entity1 in contrast , on the professional field of his dreams , he seemed to encourage it			1
here , the message was all about theatrics and melodrama			0
we return to that consulting room			0
the man has emerged from the swoon , but the landscape is , if anything , grimmer and more industrial as ever			0
he is presented with a list of options			0
the trouble is if this does not demolish the tumour , then he ca n’t have the operation known as a radical prostatectomy			0
there ’s another form of treatment that he does n’t even wish to talk about			0
he opts for an appointment with the knife			0
‘ i ’d rather get rid of whatever i ’ve got , ’ he says			0
you can see he ’s reliving the moment : he ’s wringing his hands so hard that you expect to see water emerge at any time			0
‘ we ’re all cowards , men			0
’ we return to the emotional front			0
certainly , mine were scattered after my operation			0
one day , in intensive care and attached to myriad tubes , i ’m laughing hysterically at the incongruity of it all ; the next , i ’m sobbing my heart out after listening to some poignant music			0
i only stop when i remember the words of an old newspaper boss of mine about never showing emotion			0
@entity30 boss sir @entity183 pours champagne for @entity6 after winning the @entity186 title @entity183 with @entity187 ( @entity188 ) , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 i notice @entity6 ’s eyes are glistening			1
‘ hey , ( initially ) you think you ’re not going to see the family again - the grandchildren			1
for me , initially , it was the @entity200			0
why me ? then you find out you ’re not alone any more			0
there are thousands ( like you )			0
you put things into perspective			0
‘ you look at others and know that you ’re not too bad			0
but , as i say , it ’s not easy to be unemotional , @entity206 ? @entity207 ! what is this ? ’ and what about the possible diminishment of sexual activity ? he brushes this aside as if it were mere dust on the mantelpiece			0
‘ do n’t forget , i had five children			0
so things were not in that other part of the world the important thing			0
the importance had to be to get back into a healthy state and return into a normal life			0
’ law and i are at different places with the illness			1
i ’ve had the surgery and the radiotherapy , and next week i start the hormone treatment			0
law , at 74 four years my senior , seems to be managing the disease that bit better			1
i sincerely hope his situation does n’t change			0
@entity6 , hopefully , is going nowhere			1
