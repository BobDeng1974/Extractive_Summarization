by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 11:03 est , 29 december 2012 firefighters and other first responders are putting themselves at a serious risk for injury or even death when responding to hybrid and electric car crashes , an industry panel revealed this week			1
the danger comes with the increased size of those vehicles ’ battery packs and becomes potentially deadly for those dealing with wrecked vehicles			0
members of @entity16 , formerly known as the @entity16 , said in a report that hybrid electric cars must be installed with industry - wide safety measures and warnings so rescue workers know ahead of time what they ’re dealing with			1
protection : @entity16 said that there must be industry - wide changes in labelling hybrid and electric vehicles in order to protect first responders ( file photo ) danger : hybrid and electric cars are more dangerous after severe crashes because of the risk of electrocution from the battery @entity38 , the chairman of the @entity16 technical committee that led the report , said that it is imperative to develop technology that will help emergency workers as well as the cars ’ passengers			1
‘ as electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers , it ’s an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident , ’ he said in a release			0
included in @entity16 ’s suggestions were switches to switch battery power off , badges on the side and rear of the car identifying that it is a hybrid , as well as lettering on the dashboard			2
each method would be consistent on all makes and models of hybrid cars , and be visible from 50 feet away – helpful , too , to tow - truck operators who must haul the car away			1
‘ think of it as a cheat - sheet for first responders , ’ mr @entity38 said			0
system : @entity16 recommends that all hybrid and electric vehicles are clearly labeled , visible to emergency workers from 50 feet away according to @entity82 , the influx of hybrid cars on the market within the last decade has led firefighters to fear that they may not be able to quickly identify which cars are fuel - powered alone and which are hybrid			1
‘ if badging is visible from 50 feet , visible on all sides and standardized , that can be nothing but a plus for us , ’ @entity88 , a training officer for the @entity89 , @entity87 @entity86 told the paper			0
they note that while @entity16 ’s recommendations are not mandatory to carry out , auto makers often follow the organization ’s advice			0
last december , the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) debuted their first responder training program for electric and hybrid cars			2
with it , emergency personnel are trained in best practices for electric vehicle accidents , and are taught how to identify electric vehicles from regular fuel - powered ones .			0

@entity16 said in a report that hybrid and electric cars need industry - wide identification that first responders can use
after an accident , hybrid cars can be *extremely* dangerous to rescue workers because of increased battery size combined with electricity
