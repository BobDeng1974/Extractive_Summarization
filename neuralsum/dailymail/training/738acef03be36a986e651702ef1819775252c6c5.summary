and now experts say that soaring numbers of men are suffering from the curse of stretch marks			1
new research shows almost a third of all customers buying anti-stretch mark products are men - with the rise in men trying to get buff in the gym largely to blame			1
he 's got the @entity20 : soaring numbers of men are suffering from stretch marks as they try quick - fix gym plans to emulate @entity26 stars such as @entity27 , who bulked up for his role as @entity29 in @entity30 there has been a growing move by men - inspired by the likes of @entity26 actors such as @entity27 - to look more masculine and beefy by pumping iron , with fitness magazines advocating ' quick bulk up ' workouts to get speedy results			1
now sales data analysed by pharmacists at @entity43 has revealed that over the last 12 months , 30 per cent of customers buying products aimed at reducing stretch marks are men - up by 10 per cent on the previous year			1
the pharmacy says it has received an increase in calls from men asking about stretch marks because they have bulked over a short space of time			2
the biggest demand was in @entity56 , followed by @entity57 and @entity58 , with an average age of 36			1
stretch marks , also known as striae , are reddish or purplish fine lines that are caused by the overstretching of skin			2
the skin has three layers - the epidermis , dermis and hypodermis - and stretch marks are created when there is excessive stretching of the middle layer of skin over a short period of time			2
arm envy : men trying to emulate @entity27 by working out are most likely to get stretch marks under the arms , where their upper chest and front shoulder muscles connect they commonly occur during pregnancy , or as a result of rapid weight gain or weight loss , muscle building , or due to growth spurts during puberty			1
@entity43 pharmacist @entity86 said : ' it ’s common knowledge that women often suffer from stretch marks during pregnancy , but it ’s less well known that men can also be affected when they start working out			0
' the most susceptible area for men to get stretch marks when they work out is under the arms , where their upper chest and front shoulder muscles connect			1
' this is because when working out , these areas tend to expand more in proportion to the rest of the body			0
the more pumped up the muscles become , the more the skin stretches			0
' a third of all customers buying anti-stretch mark products are men - with the rise in men trying to get buff in the gym largely to blame he added : ' although women could get stretch marks from working out , they tend to prefer to tone areas , as opposed bulking up their muscles quickly			1
' when trying to lose fat or gain muscle , the key is to do it gradually - any more than one or two pounds per week , could stretch the skin too quickly , so it ’s essential to keep the skin well moisturised before and after working out			0
' it ’s important to keep a close eye on key areas such as biceps and to treat stretch marks as early as possible - once they turn silver , they are far more difficult to treat			0
' but alongside this move towards buffer bodies , men are also more comfortable in admitting they use products to combat stretch marks			2
demand has risen for products such as @entity141 , @entity142 , and @entity143 to help counter the side effects of stretch marks , according to the sales figures			2
pharmacists recommend regularly moisturising with products , which contain @entity149 and @entity150 , as they play an important role in healing the skin			0
they also recommend products such as @entity141 , which contains @entity153			0
