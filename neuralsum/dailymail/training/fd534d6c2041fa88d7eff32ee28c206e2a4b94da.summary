@entity70 of @entity0 touches down for a try as his pack drive the @entity11 scrum over the try line @entity75 supported by @entity25 of @entity0 takes on @entity76 of @entity11 at @entity2 @entity0 paraded all their major summer signings for @entity4 home debuts while @entity9 handed a first start to @entity81 hooker @entity80 in a team captained by flanker @entity83 , as they targeted an immediate riposte after losing at home against @entity86 seven days ago			1
and the visitors made a sparkling start , going ahead through a well - executed try that had its origins in poor @entity0 lineout work			0

@entity9 looked shell - shocke , and they suddenly had it all to do after dominating the first half through @entity19 's excellence			0
a long - range @entity19 penalty edged sale back in front , but their defence was unlocked again 16 minutes from time when may turned provider and @entity27 finished off wide out			2
