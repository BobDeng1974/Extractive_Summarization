by @entity0 published : 17:37 est , 20 october 2012 updated : 07:32 est , 21 october 2012 a mysterious ground shake through parts of southern @entity3 rattled residents around 11am this morning leaving bewildered residents still without answers			1
both the @entity7 and the @entity8 reported no earthquake having occurred in the area and the nearby military base claiming to have had no training exercises that would have caused the tremors			1
the @entity7 has since speculated that the shake felt by residents in southern counties for an estimated 15 seconds was from a sonic boom			1
reports : a map by the @entity7 shows the coloured counties where the shake was reported on saturday , seen the most through the southern coast the effect would be a ' thunder - like noise a person on the ground hears when an aircraft or other type of aerospace vehicle files overhead faster than the speed of sound or supersonic , ' according to @entity31			2
an officer with the @entity33 said they had not confirmed it having been a sonic boom as reported by local news reports but told @entity37 it was a ' non-event			1
' the shake was reported in several counties including @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
' i 'm in [ @entity47 ] and my basement door shook violently for 15 sec or so long enough to creep me out			0
sounded like someone was trying to get out , ' a resident wrote on the @entity52 page for @entity53			0
' my dog whelped two times before it happened i had thought he hurt himself			0
then the huge noise boomed and my house shook slightly			0
it felt like it came from above , ' a claimed @entity60 resident wrote			0
last weekend @entity62 had advised residents of scheduled military training that could cause booms and ground tremors			1
base spokesman @entity67 told @entity68 that was n't the case for today			2
' there currently is no training of any type that would have resulted in today 's incident , ' he said			0
eager to suggest other causes for the tremor , residents on @entity52 pitched ideas consisting of : fracking , ‘ @entity82 dropped his @entity83 , ’ governor @entity79 jogging , and ' @entity80 fell off a barstool			1

the @entity7 has speculated the shake was from a sonic boom
local military base said military training is not *responsible*
