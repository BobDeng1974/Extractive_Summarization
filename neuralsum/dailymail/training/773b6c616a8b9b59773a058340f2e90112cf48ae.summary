a petition has been launched to save the @entity2 's adored diplodocus skeleton following an announcement it is to be pulled from the museum 's great entrance hall and replaced with a blue whale			1
it was revealed yesterday museum bosses are to replace it because it was no longer considered relevant , while its replacement blue whale would act as a reminder of ' our responsibility to the planet '			1
but the decision has backfired , with the 110 - year - old diplodocus - affectionately known as @entity20 - now the focus of a vociferous campaign calling for it to remain where it has enthralled millions for the past 110 years			1
pictured is an artist 's illustration of what it will look like the campaign , aptly titled ' @entity43 ' , has so far gathered more than 14,000 signatures			1
the online petition states @entity20 is ' loved around the world and is a monument of @entity49 heritage			2
replacing @entity20 with a blue whale skeleton would threaten this and lead to many unhappy faces			2
' he has inspired generations of schoolchildren to look back to the earth 's past and help them think about looking after the planet 's future			1
' furthermore , it demanded ' dippy is saved and remains in the main hall forever '			2
the change is part of a ' decade of transformation ' planned at the museum by its director , sir @entity67			0
dippy is a fake - one of 10 replicas around the world based on the near - complete skeleton of a real @entity26 unearthed in @entity73 , @entity74 , in 1898 and housed at the @entity75 in @entity76			0
if the change goes ahead as planned , from summer 2017 , it will be replaced with the 83ft long real skeleton of a blue whale , suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central @entity83			1
an artist 's impression of how the blue whale skeleton will look			2
it will welcome visitors as the central display in the @entity2 's @entity83 from summer 2017 an artist 's impression of how the skeleton of the blue whale will look suspended and ' diving ' from the ceiling the whale skeleton is shown here in the @entity34 , where is has long been the centrepiece the whale , previously the centrepiece of the @entity34 , and a resident of the museum since 1891 , is a symbol of environmental destruction and hope , sir @entity67 said			1
the biggest animal ever to have lived on @entity107 at 160 tonnes , it was hunted to near extinction for its oil , meat and body parts			0
it is still endangered but its population has recovered ten-fold after being granted protected status in 1967			0
sir @entity67 said : ' the story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet			0
our purpose is to challenge the way people think about the natural world , and that goal has never been more urgent			0
' dippy , however , wo n't be left in pieces in a dusty cupboard			0
there are plans to send the model on a tour of the @entity49			0
' @entity20 's an icon of the museum but the new exhibit will allow us to tell a range of stories , ' sir @entity67 said			1
the museum recently unveiled a stegosaurus exhibit which , unlike the diplodocus , is made of real fossils			1
sophie the stegosaurus is the most complete dinosaur to go on display at the museum for over a century , and the most complete stegosaurus specimen in the world			0
the @entity2 holds over 80million specimens , including mammoth skeletons and items from the voyages of @entity151 and captain @entity152			2
the museum has a moon rock brought back from the @entity156 mission , the only piece in the @entity49			0
it keeps a 900 - strong colony of tiny flesh - eating beetles , which it uses to strip carcasses down to skeletons for study or display			0
the most valued fossil in the museum 's collection is the archaeopteryx , or the ' first bird ' , which is 150million years old			1
the @entity2 's great hall photographed in 1895			1
it was designed by @entity174 ( 1830 - 1905 ) and opened to the public on @entity176 , 1881 this sperm whale skeleton stood in the central hall between 1882 and 1901			2
the whale was found near @entity180 , @entity181 , in 1863 , and two years later its skeleton was presented to the museum by captain @entity184 the @entity2 ( pictured left in 1882 ) welcomes more than five million visitors a year			1
on the right , photographed in 1910 just three years after his arrival is the @entity190 elephant nicknamed @entity191			0

@entity2 's *famous* model of a diplodocus is to be *retired*

@entity201 *institution* has decided the exhibit is no longer relevant enough
the ' @entity43 ' petition , launched by @entity204 , aims to help retain its place
it has been displayed in the museum 's great hall for the past 110 years
