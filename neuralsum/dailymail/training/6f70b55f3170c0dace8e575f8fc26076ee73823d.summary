the next mayor of @entity1 will be chosen at the polls today and it is @entity5 's race to lose as the @entity7 candidate is beating his @entity9 rival by more than 40 points in the latest polls			1
even though experts predict that turnout will not be particularly high , @entity5 's lead is so great that there is little to stop him from becoming @entity17 's successor			1
@entity18 got another boost of moral support from his daughter @entity21 who surprised him tuesday morning by flying to @entity1 from her college in @entity23 in order to go to the polls with him			0
‘ there 's only one poll that counts and it 's the one that closes at 9pm , ’ @entity52 said at a monday campaign appearance			2
the campaign has been as much about the policies of @entity61 , who leaves office at the end of the year after three terms , as the candidates ' vision for the future			0
@entity18 frequently talks about the ‘ two @entity69 ’ - one rich , one poor - and how the city has left less fortunate @entity1 behind as the contrast between the have 's and have - not 's has grown increasingly stark			2
@entity18 , who as the city 's elected public advocate acts as an official watchdog , has positioned himself as a clean break with the @entity61 years , promoting a sweeping liberal agenda that includes a tax increase on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten and improved police - community relations			0
he has especially criticized the controversial police tactic of stop - and - frisk , which critics say unfairly targets poor blacks and @entity84			0
who are you voting for ? the proud father peers over at his daughter as she casts her vote something to look forward to : the candidate 's son @entity39 , 15 , is too young to vote but accompanied his father and the rest of his family to their polling station in @entity43 @entity17 has called the approach central to the city 's anti-crime fight , while @entity5 has blasted it as destructive to police and community relations			1
those campaign tactics , and a pledge to reach out to @entity1 who feel left behind by what they believed were @entity61 's @entity109 - centric policies , have been rewarded in the polls			0
@entity52 , who has struggled to shake @entity5 's formidable lead , has launched an assault of negative ads. but that strategy has mostly backfired with an increasing number of voters saying they have a negative view of the @entity9 , @entity51 has found			1
though registered @entity7 outnumber their @entity9 counterparts 6 to 1 across the city , the last @entity120 to become mayor was @entity122 in 1989			2
last looks : @entity9 candidate @entity52 reviewed election documents with his wife in a @entity127 station hoping for a comeback : former mayor @entity129 ( left ) campaigned with @entity52 ( right ) on the final day before the polls opened , as @entity52 used to work for @entity129 however , the @entity9 victories were tied to some extraordinary events that scrambled the political landscape			0
mayor @entity129 defeated @entity122 in 1993 amid fears about the city 's soaring crime rates , and @entity61 won in 2001 largely thanks to his fortune and the fallout from the september 11 attacks			0
opponents have been counting down the days until @entity17 's third term comes to a close , but for many months of the ensuing campaign , @entity18 did not seem like his likely successor			2
he was a distant fourth for much of the summer in the crowded @entity7 primary , only to surge past former front - runners including city council speaker @entity148 and ex-congressman @entity149 , and is now on the verge of ending an improbable @entity9 winning streak in the mayor 's office			1
bowing out : mayor @entity17 served for an unprecedented three terms after extending term limits			1

*democrat* @entity5 was leading in the last poll taken on monday
election comes as mayor @entity17 finishes his third term
even though @entity1 is *overwhelmingly* *filled* with @entity7 voters , the last time there was one in the mayor 's mansion was in 1989
