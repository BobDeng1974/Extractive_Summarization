a leading force in football 's battle against racism has been criticised after he called an @entity6 supporter a ' coconut '			1
@entity8 , who is the executive director of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) organisation , has been a vocal figure in the game 's recent rows			1
but an exchange on @entity14 has left mr @entity8 , who is also @entity6 , embroiled in a race controversy of his own making			1
outburst : in a @entity14 exchange @entity8 , executive director of the @entity9 , sparked fury by telling @entity6 football fan @entity20 not to be ' a coconut ' @entity22 fan @entity20 , 34 , tweeted @ piarapower : ' interesting how u have n't given your opinion on the news that a £ mufc fan was arrested on wednesday for alleged racial abuse			1
' he received a staggering reply from mr @entity8 , who used @entity14 's private messaging function to contact mr @entity20 , which said : ' get lost @entity20			1
do n't be a coconut			1
' mr @entity20 was referring to @entity35 fan @entity34 , 57 , who was today fined £ 200 for chanting racist abuse at a black @entity38 player during a match on january 31			1
mr @entity8 had earlier condemned @entity22 and the way it handled the @entity42 affair - where the striker was banned for eight games after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity45 during a match against @entity35 in october			1
manifesto : in a statement on its website fare sets out the organisation 's aim to tackle racism at all levels of the game and @entity8 also condemned the alleged racist abuse by a @entity22 supporter towards @entity58 's @entity57 last @entity60 ' coconut ' is an extremely derogatory term used to accuse someone of betraying their heritage by pandering to ' white ' opinion			1
it stems from a coconut being brown on the outside and white on the inside			1
mr @entity20 , a postman from the @entity70 , is appalled by mr @entity8 's comments and has branded him a ' hypocrite '			1
use of the ' coconut ' label also caused outrage two years ago			1
in 2010 , @entity77 , a black @entity77 councillor , used the phrase to describe her @entity80 opponent , @entity79 , after she backed spending cuts for ethnic minority projects at a @entity84 meeting			0
@entity77 was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment and given a 12 - month conditional discharge			0
he said : ' at first i was shocked because in all my life i have never been called a coconut			1
' i 've been called p * * i , a rag head and other racist names by non-asians but never a coconut			2
' it is more insulting to me to be called a coconut than a rag head because some of the people who used that term are just ignorant			2
' but for one @entity6 to call another @entity6 man a coconut is like being called a traitor			1
it is like saying you 're betraying your own race or roots , in my opinion			0
' mr @entity8 , who has been criticised by a number of football fans for his ' coconut ' jibe , has now ' protected ' his @entity14 account so only his followers can read his tweets			1
mr @entity20 added : ' i think he is a hypocrite and a person who has an agenda against @entity22			1
he did n't comment on the @entity35 fan who was arrested			1
' if he is against racism then he should n't be selective on who he chooses to condemn			2
' a spokesperson for @entity9 and mr @entity8 declined to comment			1
