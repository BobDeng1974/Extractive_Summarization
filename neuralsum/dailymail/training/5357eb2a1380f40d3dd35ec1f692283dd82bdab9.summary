life lessons : author @entity1 was n't confident growing up the pressure of trying to achieve an unrealistic ' ideal body ' is one that has long plagued girls through their teenage years and beyond			1
it 's something author @entity1 is familiar with having struggled with her own appearance and self confidence growing up in @entity9 and @entity10			1
after graduating from @entity12 and establishing a successful career in advertising , it 's only now at the age of 40 she is finally feels more secure in her own skin			2
as a result , she has overhauled her life by moving to @entity19 and becoming a writer			2
she has written three self - esteem books for young girls called @entity23 and is supporting @entity24 , which culminated in the @entity25 at the @entity26 last night			1
here , she reveals the six things she wishes she had known when she was a young girl struggling to make her way in the world ... 1			2
if others say you 're ugly , a loser , a swot ... it 's only because they are somehow threatened by you i went to a bitchy girls school and i realise now when i talk to some of the girls in my year that they actually remembered me as the clever one who got to date the nice boys			1
but at the time , i believed any bad words that were said about me			2
somehow their vision of me was more important than my own			2
i know now that everyone brings their stuff , their jealousies and insecurities - so take everything with a huge pinch of salt			2
if you please others the whole time you 'll never end up pleasing yourself as a teenager , i chose to go to @entity12 in part for my parents			2
i loved it there but i felt constantly under pressure in such an academic environment			2
i then chose advertising as a career as i needed a proper job with money and status , so that others thought i was ' doing well '			1
pressure to look good : @entity1 advises young girls to focus more on their personality than their appearance i married my boss because he was older , established and my friends / family would think he was a good catch			1
deep down none of these decisions were right for me			1
i had no idea what i wanted , so i chose what everyone else wanted for me			0
in the end you 'll rebel			0
i did at the age of 35			0
i 'm now doing what i believe in - i write , i moved to @entity19 to be with my @entity19 husband and i chose not to have kids			0
none of these are particularly popular choices but they are who i am and that 's more important			0
@entity93 lights up a room , not fake eyelashes and hair extensions i used to obsess about being fat , ugly , short , frizzy - haired , and i thought everyone was horrified when i walked in a room			1
i could n't flick through a teen mag without feeling inadequate			0
the pressure for girls today is even greater with websites dedicated to ' thinspiration ' , the obsession with image on social media and the relentless pursuit of perfection in the fashion world			0
now i know that most people are n't looking at that one spot or unkempt eyebrow or thighs that touch			1
most normal nice people do n't care - they worry about what 's on the inside			1
feelings of inadequacy : teens should talk to someone if they feel down 4			0
if there is something you really want to do ... then just do it never give up , if it 's your true passion , your gift will happen			0
i loved ballet , i had the chance to do it professionally but reason prevailed and i focused on my academic studies			0
i 'm sure it was n't my vocation but denying myself the chance to explore it has left a pain , a form of nostalgia			0
every time i go to see the @entity135 at @entity136 i get a twinge in my heart			0
i also loved writing as a little girl but the path to doing that seemed complicated and uncertain - yet now i 'm a published author			0
if someone 's bullying you or if you 're feeling down ... talk to someone i used to bottle up a lot of my feelings , pretending all was ok and i carried on smiling so i did n't disappoint or worry anyone			0
having been through therapy i appreciate the well worn phrase ' a problem shared is a problem halved '			0
issue needs to be taken seriously : more should be done to help young people with low confidence 6			1
low self - esteem is a serious issue from the age of ten to about fifteen i went through a gawky stage			0
like most other teens , i believed i was so much uglier , so much geekier than everyone else			0
it made feel very alone and miserable			1
i suffered from lack of self esteem in my late teens becoming anorexic and i still struggle with bouts of low confidence			1
it 's time for the nation to take seriously the issue of low self - esteem as it is one of the biggest threats to a woman 's well - being			0
it is time confidence - building and self - belief were formally incorporated as part of the school curriculum , that media changed the beauty conversation and that girls are given every chance in the world to be happy			1
i 'm glad this is now being addressed with the launch of @entity24			1
