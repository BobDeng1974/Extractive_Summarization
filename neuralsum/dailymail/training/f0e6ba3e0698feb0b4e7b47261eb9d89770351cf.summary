by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 07:32 est , 22 august 2013 a failed asylum seeker who came to @entity2 unable to speak @entity3 has secured a place at @entity5 - but now worries that his whole family could be deported to @entity7			1
@entity8 achieved outstanding grades in his a-levels after just two years of living in the country			1
however , since his family 's asylum request was rejected , he faces the prospect of being kicked out of @entity2			1
success : @entity8 has secured a place at @entity5 two years after moving to @entity2 from @entity17 @entity8 , 18 , is of @entity7 descent but was born in @entity19 and grew up in @entity17 - which is now being torn apart in a brutal civil war			1
in february 2011 , he came to @entity2 with his mother @entity21 , 17 - year - old brother @entity22 and sister @entity23 , seven			2
the family settled in @entity25 , and @entity8 started studying for his a-levels at @entity26			2
despite the language barrier , he was quickly able to excel , especially in the sciences			0
last week he received his a-level results , learning that he had achieved an a * in maths and a in chemistry and physics			0
nightmare : the 18 - year - old 's family faces being deported after their asylum claim was rejected ' if this was two years ago i would have said getting these results was impossible , ' he said			1
' it 's been really surprising			0
' i did n't speak a word of @entity3 and it was really hard work , especially in the first year			0
i found it difficult to understand the teachers , so i used to bring a tape recorder to all my lessons to play it back afterwards			0
' my grades could 've been much better if i had better @entity3 but i 'm really pleased with them			0
' he was awarded a place to study physics at @entity55 , @entity5 , whose alumni include @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
the family had applied to stay in @entity2 , claiming that they would be in danger if forced to return to @entity7 or @entity17			1
but the asylum claim was turned down , meaning they will be deported if they do not leave voluntarily			1
prestigious : @entity8 is now hoping to study physics at @entity55 , @entity5 ' there 's a fear that they will send us back and it 's just not fair , ' @entity8 said			2
' this is my home now			0
' if we go back our lives are at risk			0
i still have friends in @entity7 and @entity17 but they fight to stay alive every day			2
' the family is currently planning to lodge an appeal against the @entity82 decision			0
if they are forced to leave @entity2 , @entity8 will be able to apply for a student visa in order to take up his studies at @entity5			1
a spokesman for the @entity82 declined to comment , saying the body does not discuss individual cases			0
his plight is similar to that of @entity92 , who was deported to @entity7 earlier this year despite building a new life in @entity2			1
the 18 - year - old had achieved 13 gcses and was considered a pillar of his community , captaining the school cricket team and mentoring other @entity7 youths			1
but he was forced to return to @entity7 , which he had fled aged 11 after his father was murdered by the @entity101 .			0

@entity8 , 18 , left war - torn @entity17 for the @entity2 in 2011
achieved top a-level grades and a place at @entity5 despite his poor @entity107
but his family could be deported to @entity7 after their asylum claim was rejected by the @entity82
