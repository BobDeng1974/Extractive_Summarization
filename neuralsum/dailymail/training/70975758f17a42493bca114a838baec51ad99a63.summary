by @entity0 @entity2 prime minister @entity1 still has no monument in her home town tomorrow is the first anniversary of the death of the most influential peacetime prime minister in @entity2 history			1
take a walk through @entity1 ’s hometown , though , and you could be forgiven for thinking she had n’t spent her formative years here			1
yes , there ’s a plaque on her childhood home , the greengrocer ’s owned by her father , @entity17 , @entity19 ’s mayor in 1946			1
but it could hardly be smaller — high up on the first floor , barely legible from the pavement			2
and it is n’t even one of the official blue plaques normally granted to the great and the good			2
today , her childhood home is a health clinic , @entity28 , specialising in ‘ chiropractic , natural therapies and beauty ’			2
in the shop window , a large poster offers a treatment to ‘ tone , slim and detox ’ you with a marine algae bodywrap			2
one wall of @entity17 ’s old shop is given over to an advert that reads : ‘ @entity42			2
’ @entity1 had many gifts — the art of relaxation was n’t one of them			1
in @entity19 ’s pretty town centre , there is nothing to remind you of the person who changed the face of @entity2			1
on the green , there ’s a statue to @entity19 ’s most famous son — sir @entity58			1
there ’s another plaque marking the spot where @entity58 lodged as a schoolboy			2
and there are two more @entity58 plaques outside @entity68 ’s @entity67 , where he was head boy			2
a few yards away , there is a bronze statue to the @entity71 , @entity19 ’s @entity72 mp , on and off , from 1826 until 1874			1
the inscription reads : ‘ erected in 1891 by the friends who revered his memory , irrespective of political opinions			2
’ i mean no disrespect to mr @entity80 but , even in the 19th century , he was n’t much of a name to conjure with in @entity2 politics			0
certainly nothing compared with the town ’s colossally famous , most distinguished daughter			0
even her most fervent supporters might not rank @entity1 alongside the man who discovered gravity			1
but surely she deserves a statue at least as much as @entity80			2
if this were @entity91 — where @entity1 is revered more than she is in @entity2 — @entity19 would be the equivalent of a presidential birthplace			1
every hotel , tea shop and pub would be plastered with @entity1 references			1
the town signs would be emblazoned with her name ; her childhood home would be bought up by admirers , and thronged with pilgrims			0
but not in modern @entity2			0
on two recent visits to @entity19 , i had the pavement outside her childhood home to myself , for half an hour each time , as i took photographs			1
@entity1 's birthplace in @entity19			1
the site was a greengrocer , then a restaurant and is now a health clinic so thank @entity114 , then , for two women who , off their own bat , have determined to leave a @entity118 stamp on the town that made her			0
the first is @entity122 , chairman of @entity123			0
three years ago , the museum was in a terrible way , with @entity126 unable to afford its upkeep			0
it had a @entity1 display , but it was woeful — not much more than one of her handbags and a pair of her shoes			1
enter @entity122 and a team of volunteers , who took over the running of the museum as a community heritage association in 2011 , and reinvigorated the @entity1 display			1
the museum remains small but now has some real gems : including the dinner jacket worn by @entity17 in his mayoral year , and an utterly characteristic royal blue dress and handbag , donated from @entity1 ’s personal wardrobe			1
there ’s a copy of @entity147 , owned by a 15 - year - old @entity1 in 1940 , and the programme for the 1937 @entity19 and @entity151 , in which she performed			1
most intriguing is the hockey stick @entity154 used to wield at @entity155 and @entity156 ’ school , where she was head girl			0
when she left , her hockey stick , and her school uniform , were passed on to @entity160 , a young neighbour , just starting at the school			0
scratched into the head of the hockey stick are two names , ‘ @entity164 ’ and ‘ @entity165 ’			0
the museum also has a copy of @entity1 ’s memoirs , inscribed by her with the words : ‘ from this town i learnt so much and am proud to be one of its citizens			1
’ but still , the streets of @entity19 are empty of any tribute to its proud daughter			1
but , with luck and a little money , not for long			0
a bust of @entity1 resided in her birthplace , but an official monument is still in the pipeline on march 8 , 2013 — coincidentally , exactly a month before @entity1 ’s death — @entity122 started an appeal to raise £ 100,000 for a @entity1 statue , and another £ 100,000 for further improvements to the @entity1 display at the museum			1
much of the money collected has come from @entity19 locals			1
@entity122 says they are still ‘ two big donations ’ away from achieving their goal			0
‘ we did n’t consider applying for government funds , ’ she says			0
‘ private donations are much more in line with @entity1 ’s beliefs			1
‘ this is a project for the community , but it should n’t be taxpayer - funded			0
@entity1 would n’t have wanted council tax to be spent on a statue			1
she ’d have said that the money could be better spent elsewhere			0
’ @entity122 is chair of the advisory panel that will determine what the statue looks like			2
three prospective poses have been considered — two standing , one sitting — but no final decision has been made			0
the plan is for the statue to go inside the museum or stand on the green			2
between @entity58 and @entity80 is a perfect stretch of grass just waiting for her			0
‘ people are concerned about the potential of vandalism , ’ says @entity122 , ‘ it depends on planning , too , but i ’d prefer it to be outside			0
’ of course it must go outside , even at the considerable risk of vandalism — another statue of @entity1 was decapitated by a thug at the @entity230 in 2002			1
but even that attack was a kind of tribute , i thought at the time — who ’d bother to decapitate a statue of @entity238 or @entity239 ? the second woman to strike a blow for @entity1 ’s memory in @entity19 is sculptor @entity243			1
as of last friday , her charming bronze bust of @entity1 has taken pride of place in @entity123 ’s main hall			1
it shows @entity1 , with a slight smile , in the early @entity250 , when she was in her 50s and her prime			1
@entity243 based the work on video footage and old photographs to ‘ absorb her personality ’			0
then she spent several months moulding @entity1 in clay before casting her in bronze			1
the bust — which is at the museum on a free loan — will be on show until the end of the month			0
@entity243 says she was inspired to do the bust because of negative reaction to @entity1 after her death			1
‘ she deserved respect after she died — i thought it was absolutely shocking how she was treated			0
‘ people were n’t getting the person behind the politician			0
and most of the art showed her as a politician , not as a woman , which is what i wanted to do			0
you had to respect her drive and determination			0
‘ i was a young adult when she came to power , so i remember what the country was like before , ’ she says			0
‘ she was a force for good at the time			0
opinion is always going to be divided			0
but her legacy was so great and she achieved so much from humble origins			0
’ as for the statue , the sculptor has yet to be decided			2
@entity122 jokes that although the material is most likely to be bronze , ‘ iron has been suggested ! ’ in the meantime , @entity1 will be remembered in the condolence book , signed in the @entity123 after her death			2
one entry pays tribute from someone who says they are for ever in her debt , having benefited from @entity1 ’s flagship policy of selling people their council house			2
it adds : ‘ people must not forget the three - day week and sitting at home in candlelight because the coal miners were on strike			0
’ another simply says : ‘ you will always be remembered in @entity19 for all you did for the country — and you were a @entity19 girl			2
