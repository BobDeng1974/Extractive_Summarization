by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:28 est , 28 november 2013 @entity3 : 12:48 est , 28 november 2013 for months , astronomers have been following a comet that 's zooming towards a blisteringly close encounter with the sun. but only today at 18.35 gmt will they know if @entity8 will survive its closest approach to our star , when it fights the sun 's fierce heat and gravitational pull , which could destroy it			1
if @entity8 , which has been branded the ' comet of the century ' does survive , scientists expect it to put on its best and brightest show yet during december , when it will appear low in the sky at dawn in the @entity21			1
@entity8 , which was discovered a year ago , is making its first spin around the sun and will come the closest to the super-hot solar surface today here , @entity8 enters the field of view of the @entity33 and @entity27 's @entity34 on november 27			1
in this picture , called a coronagraph , the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible			0
the comet is seen in the lower right and a giant cloud of solar material , called a coronal mass ejection is seen billowing out under the sun some scientists fear the delicate comet has already started to disintegrate , even before it grazes the ' surface ' of the sun , 1.2 million kilometres away			1
dr @entity52 , an expert in astronomy at @entity54 , told @entity55 that when the comet enters the sun 's hottest outer layers it will be exposed to a temperature of several million degrees			1
it is now thought to measure less than a mile ( 1.6 kilometres ) wide and could fry and shatter , as a victim of the sun 's incredible power			1
professor @entity64 , associate director of @entity65 , told the @entity66 : ' it 's like throwing a snowball into fire			1
it 's going to be tough for it to survive			1
' but luckily , it 's a big object and it moves fast , so it wo n't spend too much time close to the @entity74 there is a lot of uncertainty			0
' professor @entity78 , from @entity79 in @entity80 , said : ' it 's going to be exposed to the worst that the @entity74 can throw at it			0
@entity8 was discovered by two amateur @entity84 astronomers in 2012 and will come within 730,000 miles of the @entity74 today appearance : @entity8 entered the view of @entity27 's @entity26 on nov. 21 , 2013 , where it can be seen with @entity89 , @entity90 and comet @entity92 ' it will be getting exposed to more and more intense solar heat , and that will start to sublimate the ices ( turning them into gas ) at an increasing rate			1
' but if the comet does survive as astronomers hope , it is set to put on an incredible show and appear at its brightest yet			1
the heat from the @entity74 will excite the dust and gas in the comet 's core , allowing it to blaze a trail , where it will appear low in the skies at dawn in the @entity21 during december			2
dr @entity52 said : ' astronomers around the world are hoping that @entity8 will become an amazing sight for the naked eye in the first half of december			2
people at home can also capture a glimpse if it survives			0
' just look out for it half an hour before sunrise from december 1 onwards			0
it will be visible low in the east south - eastern horizon			0
' earlier this week , @entity27 has released a high resolution image of the streaking comet that look like a swimming tadpole			0
it was captured by the h - 1 camera on board @entity27 's @entity26 on november 21			0
@entity27 said @entity8 , which is officially labelled as @entity8 , appeared to still be intact in its video and can be seen in these images along with @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity133			2
the tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles – called the solar wind – that flows out from the sun. a composite image from the @entity144 's @entity143 telescope in @entity145 shows @entity8 streaking toward the sun on nov. 15			1
the image combines four different 30 - second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths should it survive , @entity8 , pronounced @entity152 ' - sahn , will be visible with the naked eye through december , at least from the @entity154			1
@entity155 at times in november with ordinary binoculars and occasionally even just the naked eye , it already has dazzled observers and is considered the most scrutinised comet ever by @entity27			0
but the best is , potentially , yet to come			0
dr @entity52 told @entity55 : ' this close encounter with the sun offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to analyse the composition of a comet			2
comets are icy , dusty snowballs - the remains from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago			0
' the long tail containing the material frozen in the comet and released through the heat of the sun offers astronomers the chance to identify different elements			1
' it has already been bright enough for astronomers to capture amazing pictures			0
however , if the comet survives its burning close encounter with the sun it may have a huge and impressively long tail with a brightness that might make it an easy to spot object even with the naked eye			2
' this happened in 1965 with the comet @entity192 that had an enormously long tail ; but some comets , like @entity196 three years ago , have been ripped apart during their close encounter by the sun 's gravitational force			1
' the magic limit for survival of the comet seems to be the size , which has to exceed 2 km so it does not get boiled away or ripped apart by the sun. @entity8 is estimated to be that size , so we should all cross our fingers and await our early @entity211 comet , ' he said			2
@entity8 , which has been dubbed the ' comet of the century ' , has been visible to the naked eye this month			2
@entity216 amateur astronomer @entity214 recorded this image from @entity218 , in @entity216 , on november 16 detected just over a year ago , the comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time			0
still fresh , this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the beginning of our solar system			2
it 's believed to be straight from the @entity229 cloud on the fringes of the solar system , which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets			2
for whatever reason , @entity8 was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward the heart of the solar system by the sun 's intense gravitational pull			1
the closer the comet gets to the sun , the faster it gets and in january , it was clocked at 40,000 mph ( 64,000 kph )			2
by last thursday , the comet had accelerated to 150,000 mph ( 240,000 kph ) but by the time @entity8 slingshots around the sun , it will be moving at a mind - boggling 828,000 mph ( 1,332,000 kph )			1
the place to see the ‘ comet of the century ’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed , such as in the countryside			0
it can be seen with the naked eye , but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail , streamers and bumps in the surface			0
it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky			0
@entity8 will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun ’s surface today at 18:35 gmt. whether it survives or is torn apart , humans have nothing to fear			1
the comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles ( 64 million kilometres ) , less than half the distance between @entity89 and the sun. the closest approach to @entity89 will occur on @entity281 - if the comet survives			1
then it will head away in the opposite direction forever , given its anticipated trajectory			0
@entity8 is named after the @entity286 , used by a pair of @entity84 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012 , but it officially is known as @entity8 , which indicates when it was discovered			1
take heart : the ' c ' means it is not expected here again			0
the comet , top right , has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout december and january			0
it could be the brightest for 100 years the comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail			0

at 18:35 gmt today astronomers will know if comet @entity8 has survived its closest approach to the sun
the comet , which is thought to measure less than a mile ( 1.6 kilometres ) wide , will pass within 1.2 million kilometres of our star
one scientist from @entity65 it will be ' tough ' for the comet to survive the sun 's intense heat and huge gravitational pull
