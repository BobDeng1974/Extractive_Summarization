@entity0 feels focusing on high - flying @entity1 is the key to fulfilling his @entity4 dream			1
the in - form @entity0 scored twice in the 3 - 0 home victory over @entity6 on saturday which briefly took @entity1 to the top of the @entity8 before @entity9 won 6 - 3 at @entity10			1
the previous week @entity0 scored the winner against @entity12 and some pundits felt the 26 - year - old was unfortunate to not make @entity16 ’s @entity4 squad for next week ’s friendly against @entity17 and the opening @entity19 qualifier in @entity20 on september 8			1
in form : @entity0 strikes for the second time against @entity6 as @entity1 went top of the league recognition : the @entity26 winger is hoping his good form will lead t an international call - up @entity16 ’s wide options include @entity30 and @entity31 even though neither player has started a @entity8 game this season , and @entity1 boss @entity35 said on saturday that his two wingers , @entity0 and @entity37 , could count themselves unlucky not to make the @entity4 squad on current form			1
but @entity0 says all he can do to win an @entity4 call - up is is keep on performing well for a @entity1 side who have won their opening three games and will head to @entity9 after the international break full of confidence			1
“ obviously it would be an honour to play for @entity4 and any player would love to play for their country , ” @entity0 said			1
“ i ’m one of them but i ’ve got no say what happens and all i can do is keep playing well and keep improving for @entity1			2
partner in crime : @entity37 scored an excellent goal against @entity6 and is also in great form “ i ’m really enjoying my football at the moment , but i ’m going to keep my head down and keep playing for @entity1			2
” @entity1 made light work of @entity6 at the @entity62 side as the @entity64 club secured their best start to a campaign for 91 years			2
but @entity0 insists @entity1 can get even better after taking nine points from nine			1
“ i feel there ’s more improvement to come , ” @entity0 said			2
“ the balance of our team when we ’re attacking ca n’t be too complacent , but we created opportunities with our movement and we ’ve got to take that into the next game			0
” @entity77 is still seeking his first league win as @entity6 manager and will use the forthcoming international break to get his new recruits up to speed as quickly as possible			0
@entity6 had a huge turnover of players during the summer and @entity77 says the new signings are still in the process of getting to know each other			0
@entity87 : @entity88 thinks both of his wide men are unlucky not to be in @entity16 's squad “ we ’ve got a group of lads who are ready and a group of lads who need some work , ” said @entity77			1
“ some of them will be doing a mini pre-season next week with a view to being closer to being available the following week			0
“ it ’s been a big ask for the boys who have come in lately and some of them were on the pitch at @entity1 , but we ’ve got to get through that			2
” @entity6 completed the signing of 26 - year - old @entity109 winger @entity108 from @entity111 side @entity110 on saturday afternoon and @entity77 said that will be the last piece of @entity6 transfer business before the window closes on monday night			0
“ we ’re done now , the work has been done - the positions we targeted at the start have now been filled , ” said @entity77			0
“ that will be our squad going forward and we will give the players time to settle in			0
“ that ’s difficult during a @entity8 campaign but we do n’t have any other choice , and i do n’t expect any to go out			0
” work to do : @entity77 says his eleven new sigings will need time to gel together this season			0
