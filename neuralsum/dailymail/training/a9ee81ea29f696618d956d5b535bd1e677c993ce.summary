by @entity0 published : 22:51 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 14 december 2013 the owners of a @entity3 state drinks bottle company have turned an irate customer 's rant into rave reviews			1
when @entity8 co-founder @entity7 saw an angry review from a customer who complained she was unable to speak to anyone over a weekend , he responded straight away			1
but instead of using the customer is always right line , mr @entity7 defended his staff 's right to uninterrupted family time over the weekends and at holidays			1
' people over profit ' : @entity21 founders @entity7 and @entity22 have been praised for standing up for their employees ' we pride ourselves on doing things the @entity28 way , ' mr @entity7 wrote to the unnamed customer			1
' not the instant gratification 24 - hour shopping on @entity32 kind of @entity28 way , but family and country kind of @entity28 way			2
' the response clearly hit a chord with customers and fans of @entity21 , an all - american produced product that hires vets to help with its work			1
@entity8 's facebook page received more than 10,000 new likes and orders nearly doubled from the previous month			1
' you ca n't give up your people for profit			2
you ca n't give up your ethics , beliefs or your core principals simply for another bottle sale , ' mr @entity7 told @entity57			0
a screenshot of the polite response to the negative review , which had been written in capital letters , has since been removed but not before it went viral			1
negative : a customer who had trouble with her order ranted about the company online company policy : @entity7 responded to the complaint , saying he was sorry the customer was upset but adding that staff were entitled to family time a few days after posting the response , the company was inundated with so many orders that it had to post a message on its @entity78 page asking customers to be patient and understanding			1
the angry customer had complained about a lost payment and , in her review , advised others that ' if they have a deadline - like @entity86 - forget about it ' , @entity85 reported			1
she complained that instead of being able to prepare for the holidays she had wasted her weekend trying to deal with her complaint			0
in response , mr @entity7 politely suggested that the customer should try embracing the holiday spirit herself , adding that his staff had been ' home with their families , doing their cards , baking cookies etc '			2
and , although he gave her his personal cell number in case she wanted to discuss the matter further , he also reiterated his company policy of ' @entity104 , product second '			0
co-founder @entity22 defended his company 's customer service hours			2
' you 're competing against people like @entity110 who have live support 24 hours a day			0
being a small manufacturer we 're not going to have live support 24 hours a day			0
' the company have tried to learn from the experience and have taken note of suggestions customers made for improvements since the story went viral			0
all @entity28 : @entity21 was founded as a green company that uses @entity28 products and hires vets mr @entity7 was pleasantly shocked by the interest in his company after the response , telling @entity128 : ' you ca n’t trade that for a bottle			1
you ca n’t trade that for 100 bottles			0
you ca n’t trade that at all			0
' he added : ' we have this silly belief that you can do well by doing good			0
to see the number of people reaffirm [ the idea ] is kind of a neat thing			0
