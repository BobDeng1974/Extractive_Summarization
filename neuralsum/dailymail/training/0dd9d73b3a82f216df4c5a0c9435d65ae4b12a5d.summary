@entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2 also named as cultural heritage sites for years it has hardly merited a second glance and is at risk of demolition - but @entity9 bus station has been named a ' historic ' work of architectural beauty and added to a list of worldwide places that need protection			1
the bus station in @entity20 , along with a @entity22 cemetery , the ancient @entity15 in @entity16 and a modernist building in @entity18 are this year 's most at - risk cultural heritage sites , according to the @entity24			1
some 67 structures in 41 countries have been placed on a ' watch ' list by the non-profit organisation which supports the preservation of ' treasured places '			2
' historic ' : @entity9 bus station in @entity20 has been added to a list of protected world monuments because of its ' concrete brutalist ' style the sites on the 2012 list balance heritage concerns with the social , economic , and environmental interests of communities around the world , said @entity24 president @entity42			1
miss @entity42 said : ' while these sites are historic , they are also very much of the present - integral parts of the lives of the people who come into contact with them every day			1
' indeed , the watch reminds us of our collective role as stewards of the earth and of its human heritage			1
' the @entity24 is an independent organisation which aims to secure the future of ' exceptional ' places through fundraising , conservation and education			2
among the newly - listed sites is the @entity61 , the oldest in the @entity22 capital , which houses the graves of important figures from the past two centuries			1
the fund said it is in need of preservation as it has fallen into neglect			2
the ancient @entity71 lines and geoglyphs in the desert of southern @entity16 are also in jeopardy due to poorly managed tourism , says the fund			2
the giant figures , which were drawn on the stone between 500 @entity78 and 500 ad , were declared a @entity79 in 1994			2
brutalist style : the distinctive bus station in @entity20 has been slated for demolition despite being recognised as an architectural gem desert design : the ancient geoglyphs in the @entity71 desert in southern @entity16 have been protected by @entity87 since 1994 built at the end of the 1960s , @entity9 bus station can hold 80 double - deckers and was once the largest terminal in the world			0
it was designed by @entity95 and @entity96 of @entity97 along with @entity98 and is described as having a ' brutalist ' style			0
the building 's engineers , @entity102 , designed the distinctive curve of the car park balconies after vertical walls proved too expensive			0
the edges have a functional aspect too - they protect car bumpers from crashing			0
the structure has been threatened with demolition for around a decade as part of the council 's redevelopment scheme			0
a survey conducted by the @entity115 last year found that @entity9 bus station was the local people 's favourite building			0
@entity118 was once the world 's largest but has been slated for demolition as part of a redevelopment scheme by the council			0
it is listed by the fund along with other @entity126 sites described as ' concrete brutalism ' including @entity0 and the @entity128 at the @entity1 in @entity2			1
the library in @entity130 is to be knocked down in 2013 while the gallery in the @entity1 complex has been refused listed building status			1
miss @entity42 added : ' these and other buildings like them date from an era in which government had the resources and the will to create major civic buildings			0
' they are too often seen as impediments to private - sector redevelopment			0
' the @entity24 also questioned the planning permission for recent alterations to the @entity146 at @entity147 , a small box - shaped glass building which sits among the @entity150 skyscrapers			0
a spokesman for the fund said : ' local advocates filed a lawsuit , and a temporary restraining order on further alterations has been issued			0
' while the case seeks to preserve an icon of @entity161 modernism , it also serves as an important touchstone for the effectiveness of preservation legislation and policies in the @entity161 , and of the government agencies charged with their enforcement			0
' several sites that have been damaged by earthquakes also made the list including locations in @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			1
since the fund started in 1996 , some 688 sites across 132 countries have been protected			1
there are seven @entity126 sites listed by the @entity24 this year			1
the others are : the medieval ruins of @entity182 ; @entity183 in @entity184 , known as the home of @entity186 ; @entity187 , a working monastery on the @entity189 , and @entity190 , the island in the @entity192 where @entity193 was held captive			0
a spokesman added : ' the international attention given to watch sites provides a vital tool with which local entities may leverage funding from a variety of sources			2
' @entity203 angles : the @entity128 in the @entity1 complex has been added to the protected list by the @entity24 - despite being refused listed building status in the @entity126 on the way out : @entity0 is to be destroyed in favour of a new Â£ 200million development neglected : the @entity61 , which houses the graves of important @entity22 figures , is in need of protection says the @entity24 monument to modernism : questions have been raised about recent alterations to the @entity146 building in @entity150			1
