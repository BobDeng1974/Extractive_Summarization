internet retail giant @entity0 is testing its drone delivery system at a secret site in @entity3 after becoming frustrated with @entity5 regulations			1
the world 's largest online store had wanted to test its @entity10 drones , which fly between 200 and 500 feet in the air , in @entity12 but has now moved its research across the border , the @entity6 reported			1
last week the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) gave @entity0 permission to begin testing one particular type of drone that the company now says is obsolete because the technology is moving so quickly			1
however , the company has already been testing in secret for the last several month at its own restricted airspace in @entity23 , about 2,000 from the border			1
@entity15 's regulations proposed earlier this year also state that the person controlling the drone must have constant sight of the robot			2
the body has only approved 48 out of more than 750 exemption requests for exemptions that would allow outdoor drone testing before new guidelines are in place			1
@entity0 's applied last july but still does not have an exemption , as it has only received a ' experimental airworthiness certificate ' for its previous prototype			0
oil giant @entity52 was the first company to get approved for commercial drones over @entity5 land last year and drone pilots for the exemptions have been required to get pilot 's licenses			1
the approval process includes nearly 100 pages of paperwork , a four hour presentation at @entity15 headquarters and a site visit			2
@entity23 has fewer restrictions , essentially allowing @entity0 do whatever testing they needed within their airspace , and only took three weeks to give the go ahead to the @entity72 - based retailer 's application			1
the @entity15 has only approved several dozen applications for drone testing licenses , though @entity23 has approved more than 1,600			1
above , boxes that can be carried by drones @entity0 plans on creating a system that can deliver goods ordered online in less than 30 minutes			2
the @entity15 's proposed rules mandate that drones would have to be in the line of sight of their pilots at all times @entity86 , which has been giving out the licenses for almost a decade while the @entity5 just started last year , said that is aims to complete applications in 20 working days			1
' in @entity23 , it 's mostly about safety , ' @entity92 drone researcher @entity91 said			2
' if you show that you know what you are doing , it 's very likely that you 'll get a licence			0
' @entity0 is developing small aerial vehicles as part of @entity102			0
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds			0
about 86 percent of @entity0 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said			0
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making @entity10 available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' the company has said previously			0
. it expects to eventually be able to deliver goods to customers within 30 minutes of online orders			0
the @entity5 's northern neighbor has granted 1,672 drone testing applications			1
' different laws and regulatory structures in other nations may allow them to act more quickly to approve certain @entity120 [ drone ] operations , ' an @entity15 spokesman said of the @entity6 's report			2
the agency 's representative said the authority is ' safety - oriented ' and approval is based on ' assessment of the risks to other aircraft and to people and property on the ground '			0
the @entity15 is expected to vote on its proposed drone rules by the end of the year			2
@entity0 hopes that it 's @entity23 testing will help build a system that allows customers to have goods delivered to their homes within 30 minutes of ordering them online			1
it is working on high autonomous robots less than 55lbs that can carry objects less than 5lbs , the vast majority of the items @entity0 ships			0
the company also has research outposts in @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152			0
@entity15 proposed rules also state that drones can not operate over people not involved with them and can not fly at night			0
@entity157 's licenses and airworthiness certificates will not be required .			0
