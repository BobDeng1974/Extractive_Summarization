by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 14 june 2013 with our increasingly hectic lifestyles finding the time to exercise is n't easy			0
but energetic night owls have found the solution by working out at 24 hour gyms			1
while gyms opening their doors to members overnight is n't a new concept , it is increasingly becoming more popular			2
those taking advantage of the extended opening times include night shift workers using their ' lunch ' hour as an opportunity to exercise , those who are self - conscious and do n't want to be seen by a lot of people when they 're working out , or those who simply want to avoid the gym at peak times when it 's busy			1
flexible fitness : more people are joining gyms with 24 hour access virtual instructor : @entity30 offer a late night spinning class where members are led via a video broadcast at the front of the class fitness fan @entity36 , 29 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said the latter is one of the main reasons why he hits the gym while others may be hitting the sack			1
he told the @entity45 : ' my job is demanding and i work long hours but i do n't want that to be an excuse not to workout			0
' i usually get to the gym between 10pm and 11pm four times a week , which means it 's quieter and i can use the machines without queuing			0
it suits my lifestyle perfectly			0
' @entity30 - who aim to offer affordable fitness with membership from Â£ 10.99 a month - have 49 gyms across the @entity62 that are operational 24 hours a day , seven days a week			1
as well as being able to use the equipment , members can take part in a virtual spin class			2
the class is led by an instructor via a pre-recorded video played on a large tv in front of the bikes			1
a spokesman for the company said the classes - and their 24 hour access - is becoming increasingly popular			1
working out after dark : the 24 hour access is popular with those with busy lives or who want to avoid the gym at peak times place to yourself : @entity30 say it 's perfectly safe to work out over night as they use cctv and links to the emergency services they said : ' the majority of our nocturnal customers are shift workers including @entity93 , police and fire service employees			1
we also see a lot of lorry drivers , people who work in the hospitality industry and students			0
' i usually get to the gym between 10pm and 11pm which means it 's quieter and i can use the machines without queuing ' ' although the majority of those people exercising outside of ' normal ' operating hours are there because they are fitting exercise in around their working patterns , there are others who simply prefer to work out late at night , or perhaps have children to look after during the day			2
' @entity30 estimate that 24 per cent of their of members train between 10pm - 6am			1
meanwhile , @entity115 , another company with branches across the @entity62 , are also open 24 hours a day to members			0
research they carried out last year found that one in ten members use the gym between 10pm and 6am , with 52 per cent of these visits taking place around midnight			2
the research also revealed that 83 per cent of gym goers are now more likely to join one with 24 - hour access so they can fit it into their busy schedule			1
at @entity132 's @entity131 gym , members gain 24 hour access via fingerprint technology both @entity30 and @entity115 give members the ability to access their equipment by giving them a unique pin number so they can enter the locked building when it 's not fully manned by staff			1
at the swanky @entity132 gym in @entity38 's @entity131 , they have a more high tech solution to allow their members - including celebrities such as @entity145 and @entity146 - access to the gym when it suits them			1
fingerprint recognition is used so members can enter the gym 24 hours a day			1
some people may have safety concerns about working out when a gym is not fully staffed and personal trainers are not on hand to advise if they are exercising properly			2
the spokesman for @entity30 said : ' " is it safe ? " is a question that comes up regularly when people are considering joining a 24 hour gym , and our answer is always : yes ! it is perfectly safe			1
' reports from customers are that they always feel very safe			0
they know there is extensive cctv throughout the gym , there is always someone working in the club no matter what time of day or night they visit , and they know that additional assistance is only seconds away , with a call button within easy reach no matter where they are within one of our gyms			2
' @entity30 and @entity115 have panic buttons linked to the emergency services that members can press if needed when using the gym over night and members will also have had an induction upon joining on how to use the equipment			1
the @entity193 on their website : ' there are several help buttons in @entity115 should you need emergency assistance during unmanned hours			2
the entire gym is monitored closely by @entity170 during these hours			0
' but what of the effects on health of exercising at night ? people are commonly advised not to workout close to going to bed because of a belief it can cause a bad night 's sleep and hinder the ability to drop off			0
' for most people exercise at any time seems to be better for sleep than no exercise at all ' but a recent study by the @entity215 debunked this theory			0
they found that : ' those who report exercising close to bedtime ... do not demonstrate a difference in self - reported sleep quality			0
in fact , for most people exercise at any time seems to be better for sleep than no exercise at all			0
' they added that : ' @entity228 has amended its sleep recommendations for ' normal ' sleepers to encourage exercise without any caveat to time of day as long as it 's not at the expense of sleep			0
' dr @entity234 who was involved in the study added : ' exercise is beneficial to sleep			0
it 's time to revise global recommendations for improving sleep and put exercise - any time - at the top of our list for healthy sleep habits			0
