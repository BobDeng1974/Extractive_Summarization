it was one of those unavoidably surreal moments in broadcasting history			0
@entity5 presenters @entity3 and @entity6 were delivering the news from one side of a glass - screen studio when a small figure in a turquoise coat loomed into view on the newsroom behind them			1
the @entity15 was shown surrounded and all but mobbed by dozens of staff , apparently ignoring instructions to remain in their seats as the monarch toured the building			1
newsflash : presenters @entity3 and @entity6 turn round to find the @entity15 has turned up during one their bulletins caught unawares : the newsreaders appeared a little flustered as their celebrity guest appeared in the background earlier she had sat motionless as she listened to a special performance in the ‘ @entity29 ’			1
just for a moment , she seemed somewhat alone			0
pensive : the queen on a visit to the @entity5 yesterday , as prince @entity33 underwent abdominal surgery the cameras fleetingly caught her looking reflective , the briefest of expressions to confirm there was a great deal on the @entity15 ’s mind yesterday			1
in different circumstances the @entity33 would have been at her side for this , one of hundreds of engagements they carry out together throughout a busy working year			1
but yesterday – not for the first time – she found herself unexpectedly on a solo mission to maintain business as usual			0
the @entity15 is known to be a fan of classical music but she was treated to a rendition of @entity53 ’s ‘ heroes ’ – which became a theme song for the @entity55 – by @entity57 band @entity56			2
at the end she chatted briefly to script lead singer and @entity61 host @entity60 and when she learnt he was playing the @entity63 , joked about the mud			0
she said : ‘ @entity63 , the place you get covered in mud ? the singer replied with a laugh : ‘ you ’ve got to bring good wellies			2
’ the @entity15 was at the @entity5 ’s new £ 1billion @entity72 headquarters on the fringes of the @entity74 , a tour that had been on each of their diaries for months			1
a thousand yards away , the @entity33 was preparing to go under anaesthetic for an operation at @entity81			1
for each of these two most senior royals , at a time when they are gently being advised to pull back from the most arduous engagements they undertake , more lone appearances such as this could easily be a taste of the future			0
he will not be alongside her for two key events next week , @entity94 , and @entity95			0
guided tour : the @entity15 visited the @entity5 to officially open the new £ 1 billion studios in @entity98 , central @entity99 joining in : radio 4 presenters @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 sit alongside the queen speech : speaking on @entity106 and the @entity107 she said how she had been to the original @entity72 with her parents before the war and then later before her @entity110 , with prince @entity33 happy : the @entity15 looked relaxed as @entity111 said prince @entity33 is ' progressing satisfactorily ' after his operation not that you would otherwise have detected any sign of easing off yesterday , despite the last - minute logistical difficulties of turning a two - person tour into one			1
prince @entity33 ( ‘ do i look bloody ill ? ’ , as he angrily once put it ) might not have been cracking as many jokes as he had done at a @entity111 garden party some 24 hours earlier , but even from his hospital bed , it is safe to assume he would have wondered what all the fuss was about			1
@entity15 , meanwhile , maintained her usual calm , although she did have to unveil a yet - to - be corrected plaque that declared she was accompanied by prince @entity33			1
showstopper : presenters on @entity106 do their best to maintain their cool despite their star guest drawing a crowd : the @entity15 maintained her usual calm as her appearance caused quite a stir at the @entity5 on set : her majesty looking pleased as she walks past the @entity135 during her tour stoic : the queen remained utterly composed , despite not having prince @entity33 by her side queen of the screen : actress @entity142 introduces herself to her majesty in front of a huge mural of @entity145 @entity146 : newsreader @entity147 bows as he shakes her majesty 's hand greetings : grinning radio 1 dj @entity152 makes his introduction then she had to fend off a question from fearless veteran broadcaster @entity156 , apparently the only @entity5 soul bold enough to ask how her husband was			1
‘ i have no idea , ’ she said , looking slightly displeased			0
‘ he ’s only just gone in			0
’ her majesty was escorted around the recently revamped building on a day when she and the @entity33 were making headlines around the world			1
‘ is that me ? ’ she enquired , watching herself on the news screens			2
all smiles : the presenters turned around and laughed when they realised @entity170 's monarch was standing behind them in the studio chat : she spoke to lead singer @entity60 of @entity56 , and they briefly discussed @entity63 , with her majesty saying he should be careful of the mud royal performance : the script played a cover of @entity53 's track ' heroes ' which became a theme song for the @entity55 reflection : only on once occasion did the @entity15 look to have something on her mind as she sat in the @entity5 's @entity29 famous fan : the queen is known to be a fan of classical music but appeared to be listening intently to the script stars : @entity192 presenter @entity193 was joined by @entity195 actress @entity194 also came to @entity98 in @entity99 to see @entity15 brave : the @entity15 still managed to smile despite being forced to visit @entity5 @entity72 without her beloved husband @entity33 , who is in hospital nearby she seemed unimpressed by the modern music ( although she did volunteer later she was a big fan of @entity201 )			1
two more familiar icons of entertainment – sir @entity204 and a @entity205 – were among those who paid their respects			0
@entity204 said afterwards it was ‘ a great shame ’ the @entity210 could not attend the opening			0
her encounter with @entity156 came before the @entity214 stalwart presented her with a special edition digital radio			0
he wished her many happy hours of listening to the radio , only to be told rather waspishly : ‘ well i do n’t get a lot of ( time ) ... to listen to the radio			0
’ she was later shown an original television camera used during the @entity110 broadcast , and was introduced to @entity223 , the @entity5 announcer who introduced the coverage back in 1953			2
miss @entity223 spoke to her about how people ’s voices tend to get lower over the years			0
‘ i had n’t noticed that , ’ said the @entity15 , adding : ‘ maybe one ’s been getting deaf			2
’ aside from her reflective moment , the @entity15 looked relaxed and at ease , appearing to enjoy meeting famous faces from television and radio			2
hundreds of @entity5 staff lined the approach to the new building yesterday , many waving @entity236			1
meet and greet : sir @entity204 and his wife , former @entity240 @entity239 , as well as veteran broadcaster @entity237 also met the @entity15 @entity241 to meet you : the @entity15 says hello to sir @entity204 with @entity243 , @entity193 and @entity244 scores of office workers and shoppers also paused to watch the @entity15 arrive and depart , following the @entity5 journalists ’ lead to take souvenir snapshots on their mobile phone cameras			1
outside in the crowd , @entity252 carried a ‘ @entity256 ’ card she planned to deliver to the clinic afterwards			0
‘ i ’ve always liked the @entity33 , ’ the 66 - year - old charity worker said			2
‘ of all the older royals , he seems to be the most down to earth			0
’ for all the proud history of @entity72 , possibly one of the most familiar addresses in the land , the @entity15 was still able to put it all into context			2
she was already six when the building was opened in 1932			0
she first visited it in 1939 , when she was still princess @entity15 , accompanying her father @entity268 , and subsequently made four more visits , not including this one			2
in a live broadcast yesterday she said it was ‘ a great pleasure ’ to come again , adding : ‘ i hope this new building will serve you well in the future			0
’ guest of honour : the queen was already six when @entity72 first opened in 1932 royal welcome : @entity280 , chairman of the @entity281 ( centre ) and the @entity5 's new director general @entity283 are ecstatic to meet @entity15 on the red carpet royal arrival : crowds turned out to greet her majesty as she arrived at @entity72 , five minutes away from where prince @entity33 is in hospital pleased to see her : flag - waving crowds turned out to wish her majesty well as she came to visit the @entity5 's £ 1bn home goodbye : her majesty smiles and waves to the crowds outside @entity72 as she heads back to the @entity111 together : @entity15 and prince @entity33 arrive to attend a garden party yesterday at the @entity111 guards : police stand outside @entity81 this morning , where prince @entity33 has been brought for an operation all smiles : the @entity15 presents the @entity33 with @entity305 's highest honour , the order of @entity305 , in the presence of sir @entity307 , high commissioner for @entity305 , at @entity111 yesterday earlier this week : @entity15 and the @entity33 attended a service at @entity309 in central @entity99 on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the @entity15 's coronation			1
