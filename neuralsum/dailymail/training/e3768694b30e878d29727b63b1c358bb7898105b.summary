by @entity0 an elderly widow who had fallen behind in her property taxes discovered she longer owned her home after trying to sell it to pay off her debt			1
unbeknown to @entity6 , ownership of her $ 1.2 million @entity9 home in @entity10 has been transferred to an investor who bought two of the liens against the property			1
the 73 - year - old widow had lived in the property for more than 40 years but after her husband died several years ago , she slipped behind on taxes and had an outstanding debt of $ 200,000			1
shocked : @entity6 knew she was behind on taxes but had no idea she no longer owned her house multiple liens had been made against the property , where mrs @entity6 had raised her two sons , but she had no idea ownership had been transferred to investor @entity27			1
by buying just two of the liens from @entity9 village for about $ 3,000 each , mr @entity27 was able to take possession of the property			1
obtaining a property through liens differs from state to state , but in most cases an investor bids on liens and then waits to see if the owner will pay off the debt			2
tax collectors wait for a set amount of time , governed by each state , before putting the unpaid property taxes up for auction			2
the winning bidder then has two ways to make money from their purchase			0
if the property owner pays the taxes in the given time , the investor gets their money back , plus interest			0
if the debt remains unpaid the investor can file a lawsuit seeking ownership of the property			2
' for him to be able to come in and take the house that my parents had paid off and lived for 40 years for a few thousand dollars , that should n't happen , ' mrs @entity64 € ™ s son , @entity63 , told @entity69			0
an attorney for the family agreed , and said more effort should have been made to alert mrs @entity6 to the legal issues she was facing			0
' there should have been a further effort to make sure that @entity6 was being advised that she was in serious jeopardy of losing title to her house , ' @entity74 said			1
the widow said although she knew she falling behind on her taxes , she did n't confide in her family because she did n't want to trouble them			0
' i have a difficult time asking for help , ' she said			0
attorneys for @entity89 and mr @entity27 are now trying to work out a deal , to ensure the widow can retain ownership of her family home			1
memories : @entity6 raised her two sons in this @entity9 home , where she has lived for 40 years deal : ownership of the house was transferred to investor @entity27 when he bought two of the liens mr @entity27 had acted legally when he bought the liens , and the village attorney approved the property transfer , his attorney @entity103 told @entity69			1
he added that when his client took on the property he did n't know the woman who lived there was an elderly widow			0
an expert in property law said cases such as mrs @entity6 's are relatively common , and that there are few restrictions on selling on liens			2
' i would imagine 30 to 40 percent of the municipalities make it easy to collect on tax liens because they want to sell the liens , they do n't want to hold them			0
it takes a long time and manpower they do n't have , ' @entity124 , a lawyer who has worked on similar cases , said			0
the @entity9 mayor and the attorney who approved the property transfer have not yet commented .			2

@entity6 had $ 200,000 property tax *arrears* on her @entity9 home
73 - year - old had no idea she was at risk of losing house
investor and widow are working out deal to return ownership to @entity89
