by @entity0 last updated at 4:40 pm on 7th november 2011 thousands of @entity2 citizens are risking the wrath of their government - by sending mountains of money to a dissident artist who was handed a bill of $ 2.4 million for unpaid tax			1
more than 20,000 people , convinced that the fee is nothing more than the ' government harassment ' of known dissenter @entity14 , have tossed $ 800,000 into his garden			1
they have also wrapped notes around fruit to throw into his yard , folded up the cash as paper aeroplanes , and wired the money			0
mr @entity14 , who was detained for three months earlier this year as part of an overall crackdown on dissent , said : ' this shows that a group of people who want to express their views are using their money to cast their votes			1
people are using these methods to re-examine the accusation that i evaded taxes			0
' nearly 20,000 people have sent more than 5.3 million yuan ( $ 840,000 ) since he announced a week ago that the @entity57 tax bureau was demanding that he pay 15 million yuan ( $ 2.4 million ) in back taxes and fines			2
the donation campaign is rare for @entity2 dissidents because of the threat of retaliation that comes with supporting high - profile government critics			2
and state - run newspaper @entity65 criticised the outpouring and warned it could be illegal			0
mr @entity14 , an internationally acclaimed conceptual artist , believes his detention and the subsequent claims of tax evasion have been interpreted by activists as a way to punish him for his often - outspoken criticism of the authoritarian government			1
he said he would not treat the money from supporters as donations , but as loans that he would repay			1
thank you : commemorative ceramic seeds from @entity14 's @entity81 art installation are prepared in packets to send to people who contribute money to him no cameras please : a @entity2 worker pretends to obstruct a photographer taking pictures outside the home of @entity2 dissident artist @entity14 in @entity57 today today , staff and volunteers at his @entity93 design company were sorting through hundreds of wire transfer receipts			1
they were also sending off packets of sunflower seeds in return , a reference to his past installation involving 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds at @entity104 's @entity103			0
volunteer @entity105 said many of the donations have been accompanied by messages of support , including ' brother , let me be your creditor ' and ' the whole family has been mobilised , everyone will be creditors '			2
other messages were poetic , with one saying : ' walk toward the light , the darkness will pass			0
' feminist scholar @entity121 described her donation as ' a form of support as well as an appeal			0
' @entity14 , who is based in the southern city of @entity127 , said : ' everyone can clearly see how the whole process of accusing @entity14 of tax evasion has not been transparent or fair			1
' he has demanded that police return the account books they seized from his studio when they detained him and that they allow him to meet with his former office manager and accountant			2
the state - run @entity65 cited unnamed experts as saying he could be suspected of ' illegal fundraising ' and said that the movement did not represent the larger @entity2 population			0
installation : @entity14 's art project @entity144 is scheduled to run until january 29 , 2012 at the @entity145 - it features 21 sets of his works , including photography , sculpture , and videos its commentary said : ' it is absolutely normal for a certain number of people to show their support for him with donations			1
' but these people are an extremely small number when compared with @entity2 's total population			0
' @entity14 's political preference along with his supporters ' can not stand for the mainstream public , which is opposed to radical and confrontational political stances			1
' the newspaper also asked if @entity14 really needed to borrow money to pay off the tax bill , as he has shown his work in @entity104 , @entity168 and @entity169 and earned large sums selling his work at auctions and through galleries			1
mr @entity14 responded to the question by saying : ' yes , i am very wealthy , but this is a separate issue			2
' i have said that i will repay every cent of the loans			0
one person 's innocence is tied together to a country 's innocence			0
i 'm not doing this to profit myself .			0
