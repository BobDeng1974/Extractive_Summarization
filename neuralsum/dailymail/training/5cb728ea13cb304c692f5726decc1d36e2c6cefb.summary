a soldier who spotted a boy with a terrible deformity while on patrol in @entity4 has spent ten years fundraising to finally deliver his promise of giving him a new face			1
former staff sergeant @entity7 , 44 , met four - year - old @entity8 a decade ago while on peacekeeping duties in @entity10			1
@entity8 was born with a debilitating condition called @entity13 facial cleft , which meant his eyes were 4.5cm further apart than normal and he had no proper nose			1
former staff sergeant @entity7 has raised more than £ 100,000 to pay for a @entity4 boy , @entity8 , to have surgery at @entity18 in @entity19 but father - of - two mr @entity7 , formerly of the 9th/12th @entity21 , was so moved by @entity8 's plight he vowed to get him state - of - the - art medical help			1
he collected an amazing £ 85,000 with a fundraising drive across @entity4 and the @entity25 before bringing @entity8 to @entity19 's @entity18 in 2003			1
the youngster underwent 12 hours of surgery with plastic surgeon @entity28 , who cut his face in half before moving his eyes closer together and building him a nose			2
the operation was a success but mr @entity28 warned that a second operation would be needed a decade later			2
mr @entity7 kept in touch with @entity8 and his parents @entity37 , 36 , and @entity38 , 44 , raising a further £ 20,000 to bring him back to the @entity25 to finish his treatment			1
@entity8 , now 14 , returned to @entity18 this week for his second operation with mr @entity28 to improve his face and help his breathing			1
when mr @entity7 first met @entity8 a decade ago he promised to help raise the money for him to have the surgery he needed on the facial deformity he was born with			1
@entity8 has now had the treatment ( pictured ) @entity8 ( pictured at the age of four ) born with a debilitating condition called @entity13 facial cleft which meant his eyes were 4.5cm further apart than normal and he had no proper nose mr @entity7 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , said he was just happy to complete the remarkable job of helping @entity8 lead the life of a normal little boy			1
he said : ‘ i was on a routine patrol in @entity4 when i was introduced to his father and went to meet @entity8			2
‘ the condition had been left untreated and had grown between @entity8 's eyes , crushing his skull , forcing his eyes apart to the point he could n't see what was ahead of him			2
a facial cleft is an opening or gap in the face , or a malformation of part of the face			2
it occurs when separate areas of the face do not join together properly when a baby is developing in the womb			0
there are many different types of clefts , one group of which are called @entity13 clefts			0
these are clefts affecting the centre of the face			0
the clefts are very rare and most children with them need multiple operations to help them breathe and eat			0
‘ but aside from the facial deformities he was just a normal , playful little boy			0
he was confident and cheeky , climbing all over me as we played football in the yard			0
‘ he was too young then to be self - aware			0
but his facial cleft was blocking his airways and without medical attention , could kill him			0
‘ i had two young sons myself at the time and there was no way i could stand back and do nothing			0
i knew in an instant i had to do everything i could to help			0
’ as mr @entity7 set about raising funds , he wrote to a long list of celebrities			2
only @entity108 replied , politely explaining he had already chosen his charities for that year			0
mr @entity28 , the surgeon , was offering his services for free but mr @entity7 still needed to pay for flights , accommodation for the family , as well as essential hospital costs			1
he raised 6,000 euros by staging a charity football match in @entity116 , with @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity120 players setting aside their conflicts to help @entity8			2
and back in the @entity25 , mr @entity7 launched a massive fundraising drive , persuading his local @entity123 to put collection boxes beside their tills			2
he said : ‘ donations poured in and i was bowled over by the generosity			0
‘ @entity8 needed three operations back then - one to remove his teeth , another to reconstruct his nose and another to reconstruct his skull			1
thanks to mr @entity7 , @entity8 has had a series of operations and procedures at @entity18			1
the pair are pictured during one of @entity8 's previous trips to @entity19 for treatment @entity8 ( pictured after his latest operation ) is expected to need one more operation and mr @entity7 has promised to be there for him and to help raise the money for this operation as well ‘ he was back and forth to the @entity25 many times , staying for as long as a month at a time			1
‘ the doctors warned us it was n't over , however , and that ten years later @entity8 would need follow up surgery			1
‘ but we have kept in touch ever since and as ten years neared i let @entity8 's family know i would raise the necessary funds - over £ 20,000			1
’ as mr @entity7 set about raising a second lot of cash to pay for visas , hospital costs and flights , he was once more amazed by people 's generosity			2
in his native @entity53 , one anonymous donor , calling herself simply ' the kind granny ' contributed a ‘ large , undisclosed ’ amount			0
and this time celebrities including comic @entity165 and musician @entity166 also answered his letters			0
after his latest operation , @entity8 ( pictured on his first trip to @entity19 in 2003 ) said : ' this is the best thing that has ever happened to me ' @entity8 's operations have been carried out by surgeon @entity28 ( right ) who has waived his fee on each occasion			2
this meant mr @entity7 only had to raise money for flights , accommodation and hospital costs with the funding in place , @entity8 underwent his four - hour follow - up operation with mr @entity28 on saturday and is making a good recovery			1
mr @entity28 , who once more waived his fees , said : ‘ this operation was really about reconstructing his nose and improving his nasal airway			2
‘ his nose was very wide and he basically did n't have a tip to it at all			0
‘ we took a cartilage from one rib , fashioned it into the shape of a nose , then used it to reconstruct his nose			0
‘ this will allow him to breath more easily , eat more easily , it will improve his speech and he will look much more like the rest of us			0
‘ to have the opportunity to greet him again and finish it off so he can lead a normal life and not worry about these things is just great			0
’ without treatment , @entity8 's condition could have killed him because his airway was being blocked mr @entity7 ( pictured with @entity8 before his latest operation ) was so inspired by @entity8 that after leaving the army he became a paramedic @entity8 will likely need a further operation on his nose and orthodontics to realign his teeth before one final surgery to correct the roof of his mouth			1
mr @entity7 , who was so inspired by @entity8 's medical progress he became a paramedic after leaving the army , says he 'll be there every step of the way			1
mr @entity7 , whose own sons @entity224 and @entity226 are now 18 and 16 , added : ‘ @entity8 has never moaned or complained the whole time i 've known him			1
‘ his mum says that after his latest operation he looked in front of the mirror and said : “ this is the best thing that has ever happened to me ”			0
‘ for me this was about honouring a promise i made all those years ago and doing everything i could for @entity8			1
‘ he 's changed my life as well and inspired me to become a paramedic			0
we 'll always have an inseparable bond			0
’ mr @entity7 ’s fundraising efforts have been supported by the @entity242 charity , which provides life - changing surgery to children from developing countries with severe facial disfigurements			1
