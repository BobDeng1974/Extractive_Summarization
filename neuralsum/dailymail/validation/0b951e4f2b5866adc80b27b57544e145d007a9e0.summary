@entity0 has said that young @entity1 should be more worried about climate change than whether smoking pot was legal			1
the @entity1 president said the legalization of marijuana should come at the bottom of a long list of priorities for youths which also included the economy , war and peace			1
he was asked in an interview whether he legalising the drug would be part of his legacy as leader			2
young people , i understand this is important to you , but you should be thinking about climate change , the economy , jobs , war and peace - maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana			1
' so far , four states and the @entity39 have legalized some recreational use of the drug , and 23 states and @entity39 permit its use for medicinal purposes			2
but @entity0 said that the @entity1 justice system was ' skewed ' towards non-violent drug offenders and the ' disproportionate ' prison sentence came at the huge cost to communities and the state			1
the president has come out in favour of decriminalization as a way to tackle the skewed system but said he felt that the issue was very separate from encouraging people to use marijuana he added that he felt ' encouraged ' by the numbers of politicians , including conservative @entity61 , who were beginning to see the cost of keeping the drug illegal did n't add up			1
@entity0 has been very open about his past experimentation with drugs and alcohol in high school			1
in 2006 , then a @entity71 @entity70 presidential candidate , @entity0 was asked about his use of marijuana			1
when asked if he inhaled - a reference to former president @entity75 who , while admitting to trying marijuana , claimed he did not inhale - the future president said : ' i did			2
' it 's not something i 'm proud of			0
it was a mistake as a young man			0
' @entity0 also suggested that if medical marijuana was the best way to relieve pain and suffering then it was something he would be open to			1
' we may actually be able to make progress on the decriminalization side , ' he added , ' at a certain point , if enough states end up decriminalizing , then @entity91 may then re-schedule marijuana			2
' but while he appeared to take steps towards decriminalization , @entity0 warned legalization was n't a ' panacea ' and there will still many who had concerns about the drug 's affect on society			1
there are currently 23 states and @entity39 which allows marijuana for medicinal purposes			0
the @entity108 on 1970 listed marijuana as a @entity110 drug making it illegal to manufacture , distribute or possess marijuana in the @entity1			0
but in august 2013 , the @entity113 confirmed it would n't challenge @entity114 or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana			0
punishment for people found in possession of the drug currently depends on the location they were caught			1
for example , in @entity114 , individuals aged over 21 can carry up to one ounce of cannabis and growing up to six marijuana plants at home without prosecution			0
the increasingly relaxed stance on the drug has seen a rise in the numbers of states looking to decriminalize or legalize the drug			0
in last year alone , @entity134 , and @entity135 voted to legalize recreational marijuana , which came into force this year , and @entity138 became the 18th state to decriminalize the drug			0
@entity140 and @entity141 became the 22nd and 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana in some form			0
they are likely to be swiftly followed by others next year when ballot initiatives in @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity153 other states are likely to be put to voters			0
only this month , a trio of senators unveiled a package of drug reforms that would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana			2
while it would n't legalize it , the bill would remove the threat of federal prosecution for patients who use it in states where it is legal .			0

@entity0 said youth should be worried about more than if pot is legal
president said climate change , economy and war were more important
@entity0 who smoked cannabis as a youngster favored decriminalization
but he said issue was separate from encouraging people to use the drug
