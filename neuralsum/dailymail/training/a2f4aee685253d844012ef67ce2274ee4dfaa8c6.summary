by @entity0 an underpants company has designed a range of briefs , boxers and shorties which use chemical warfare technology to filter flatulence			0
and there 's no need to feel embarrassed about buying them - even @entity9 player @entity8 has a pair			2
unisex : shreddies flatulence - absorbing underwear comes in a range of styles for men and women shreddies - no relation to the breakfast cereal - feature a special , highly porous carbon cloth back panel which works by absorbing , trapping and neutralising flatulence odours			1
the thin , flexible cloth - the same activated carbon material used in chemical warfare suits - is then reactivated simply by washing the pants and does not need replacing			2
the award - winning underwear is suitable for both men in women and comes in a range of styles , all of which are meant to fit the body more snugly than conventional underwear			1
women can buy shreddies in briefs , high - leg briefs or shorties , while men can purchase support boxers , adjustable support boxers , hipsters and briefs			2
the hi - tech underpants - which are now being advertised in women 's magazines as ' a girl 's best friend ' - are particularly useful for sufferers of digestive disorders such as @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , crohn 's disease , @entity59 , @entity60 and food intolerances , or those suffering the after effects of bowel surgery			0
now and then : shreddies - pairs of which are owned by @entity66 and @entity8 , left - function using the same technology employed in chemical warfare suits there are many flatulence relief remedies on the market - including pills and charcoal tablets - but no effective anti-flatulence treatment for sufferers of such complaints , and shreddies offer a proven method of removing the odour of excessive bad gas			2
customers who have used @entity77 - which won the @entity82 @entity83 at the @entity85 awards in 2009 - have commented on their website , with one man saying his wife calls them his ' socialising underwear '			1
another , @entity90 from @entity91 , says : ' they 're an answer to a prayer , absolutely fantastic , so effective and discreet			0
i only wish they 'd been invented 40 years ago ! ' i know the problems they address are usually the subject of a joke , but it 's no joke if you actually suffer from them , just the reverse			0
' it 's marvellous to have the security they provide , both at work and socially , in fact in every situation			0
i 'm so glad someone came up with this idea and will definitely be ordering some more			0
' a perfect pair : @entity114 holding some pants ( not @entity77 ) alongside @entity66 on @entity116 how they work : shreddies underpants function by filtering flatulence through a thin , highly porous carbon cloth shreddies previously featured on breakfast tv show @entity116 , during a segment in which presenters @entity114 and @entity66 pretended to squabble over a men 's pair			1
in the end , @entity114 took the underpants home , but @entity77 spokesman @entity128 said : ' @entity66 was really trying her best to get her hands on the pants but with very little success because @entity114 really was n't letting go			1
' since their pant - related tiff @entity66 has requested that we send her over her very own pair of flatulence filtering underwear and one for her other half - of course we were more than obliged to do so			1
' shreddies also design underwear for people suffering from incontinence and those with stomas and colostomy bags .			0

@entity66 obtained ' @entity77 ' for both herself and her *fiance*
award - winning underwear contains discrete carbon back panel
