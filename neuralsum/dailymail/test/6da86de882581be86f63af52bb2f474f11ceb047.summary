thousands of people have signed a petition calling for a controversial weight loss advertisement to be pulled , as @entity3 slammed those complaining about the posters as ' chubsters '			1
the bright yellow advert for @entity8 has been put up in a number of @entity11 stations and features a model in a bikini with the question : ' are you beach body ready ? '			1
but the campaign , which promotes the brand 's weight loss collection , has attracted the ire of many social media users and body image campaigners , with some of the posters even being defaced			1
now @entity3 has waded into the row , dubbing those who have been vandalising posters ' chubsters ' , and saying they should turn their efforts to exercising instead			1
@entity3 , who has been outspoken about weight in the past , tweeted : ' @entity49 , quit vandalising @entity8 ads and get your a * * * running on the road			1
feminism is n’t an excuse for being fat			1
' ads for ‘ beach body ready ’ vandalised			1
society has huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny			2
' ' we are cheer leading chubsters ; " brave " " beautiful inside and out " but we are quick to shame those with self control , eating in moderation			0
' the former celebrity big brother star , who has made a documentary about her own weight gain and loss , later added : ' let 's get the @ @entity72 ads at the top of stairs and steep hills			0
get the chubsters with their sharpies shifting their chubby a * * * *			0
@entity3 tweeted : ' @entity49 , quit vandalising @entity8 ads and get your a * * * running on the road ' @entity3 has previously been outspoken on the issue of weight , and wrote on @entity83 that ' society has a huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny ' @entity3 spoke out against those campaigning for the advert to be withdrawn on @entity83 @entity3 later declared that she was going on a run , and encouraged ' angry chubsters ' to chase her ' off for a run			1
angry chubsters - feel free to catch me and tell me about your ' medical issues ' @ @entity72 '			0
the change.org petition states : ' @entity8 is directly targeting individuals , aiming to make them feel physically inferior to the unrealistic body image of the bronzed model , in order to sell their product			1
' perhaps not everyone ’s priority is having a ‘ beach body ’ ( by the way , what is that ? ) , and making somebody feel guilty for not prioritising it by questioning their personal choices is a step too far			1
' a body ’s function is far more intricate and important than looking ‘ beach ready ’ , so in fact it is @entity8 who have confused their priorities , if anyone			1
' the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) said it has received 216 complaints about the ad , and a spokeswoman said the general nature of the complaints is that the ad is ' offensive , irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image '			2
an investigation has not been launched but the @entity122 said they are ' carefully assessing ' the complaints to ' establish if there are grounds for further action '			0
online fitness store @entity8 , who claim the image has not been doctored using @entity137 , have also been actively engaging in the furore on social media , strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved @entity83 users			2
@entity143 , head of marketing at @entity8 , said it was ' great ' that @entity3 had added her voice to the debate			1
' i think much of what is being said and shared online @entity3 is obviously in agreement , ' he said			1
@entity3 was regularly seen exercising during her time in celebrity big brother ' it 's great to have somebody of such high profile getting involved at all , because it 's obviously something that we want to be discussed			1
' we want to encourage discussion on this			0
ultimately we want to encourage a healthier , fitter nation			0
we want to encourage everybody to be the very best version of themselves			0
' it has been quite odd how many people we 've found who are far quicker to fit shame than fat shame			2
' and you know if that makes us bad then so be it , and if @entity3 is in agreement with us then we 're delighted , ' he said			1
last week @entity3 was blasted by the @entity173 's @entity172 after she likened migrants to cockroaches			1
a change.org petition calling for the removal of the adverts has now attracted more than 43,000 signatures , while critics of the billboard have started a hashtag # everybodysready many of the posters have been doctored , including this version which had been put up on a train another campaigner has their say on one of the @entity8 posters @entity192 @entity191 said the reality television star had used language in her @entity196 column similar to that used by newspapers and radio stations in @entity200 before the 1994 genocide which led to hundreds of thousands of people being slaughtered			2
mr @entity143 said @entity8 has no official relationship with @entity3 , adding : ' we do n't endorse any of her other comments or views necessarily			1
' the company 's @entity83 account retweeted @entity3 but mr @entity143 said a retweet does not mean endorsement , adding that it was ' great ' to have someone with such a ' strong following ' wade in to the debate			1
he said there is ' no concern ' on behalf of the company regarding the petition			0
@entity3 has described those campaigning against the controversial @entity220 ' adverts as ' chubsters ' ' we wo n't be removing the ad			1
i mean , there 's more than two and a half million people use the @entity11 every day and , like i say , sales have considerably jumped , so regardless of that 40,000 i think i can comfortably say that we 've had ... it 's been better for us , there 's been far more positive reaction than negative , ' he said			0
mr @entity143 said they ' always welcome constructive criticism " but said there were " some serial perpetual complainers out there '			0
he said some of the criticism has demonstrated ' irrational extremist behaviour ' , such as the ' vandalising ' of adverts			0
mr @entity143 said @entity8 is ' not a faceless corporation that 's just going to sit silently ' , adding : ' we 're a brand with a personality and that means there will be certain level of engagement across our social media channels which might take some people by surprise			0
' he said he fully endorsed that engagement , adding : ' that 's part of our strategy			0
' @entity8 ’s @entity83 account has tweeted that it is ' here to motivate , not commiserate ' , and used the hashtag # getagrip			0
' we are a nation of sympathisers for fatties , ' a spokesperson for @entity8 tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert			2
' why make your insecurities our problem ? ' mr @entity143 said if significant ' vitriol ' is directed towards @entity8 , they are not going to ' sit back and ignore it '			0
the model at the centre of the controversy has also responded to the ' contradictor ' drama , citing the irony of people getting angry about body shaming , whilst body shaming her			2
' i think nearly every ad campaign you have ever seen is open to interpretation			2
but saying the ad is body shaming by body shaming the image is very contradictory			2
two wrongs do n't make a right , ' she told the @entity292			2
@entity294 ms @entity38 , who is a strict vegan , said : ' i am a real person behind the image			1
i work very hard and live a healthy and active lifestyle which is why @entity8 chose me for their campaign			2
i could n't work every day as a full time model by starving myself , dieting or not looking after my body			1
nourish your body , be kind to it and it will love you right back , no matter your size			0
' i agree that all bodies are ' beach body ready '			1
skinny , curvy , muscular , petite , tall , short , young and old			0
confidence is beautiful no matter what size you are ...			0
your reflection does n't define your worth			0
