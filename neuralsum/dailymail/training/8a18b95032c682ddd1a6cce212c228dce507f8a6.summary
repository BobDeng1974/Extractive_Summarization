by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:56 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:03 est , 17 december 2013 after working for days without success to fix a cooling system problem that crippled the @entity6 , @entity3 announced today that a decision has been made to proceed with spacewalks in an effort to fix the problem externally			1
@entity3 has ordered up a series of urgent spacewalks to fix a broken cooling line at the @entity6			1
station managers decided on tuesday to send two @entity16 astronauts out as soon as possible to replace a pump with a bad valve			1
it 's a major job that will require three spacewalks â € ” saturday , monday and next wednesday on christmas day			1
do n't look down : @entity3 astronauts plan to perform three spacewalks , culminating in one on christmas day , to repair the @entity6 's coolant system chilly up here : a flow - control valve designed to carry ammonia along the outside of the station failed last week making it too cold expedition 38 crew members : @entity3 astronaut @entity30 ( 2nd from left , back row ) and @entity3 astronaut @entity32 ( far right , back row ) , both flight engineers will take part in the spacewalk including one on @entity36 walkies : @entity16 astronaut @entity30 is likely to be one of those who will take part in a spacewalk			1
@entity3 said the spacewalks were scheduled for saturday , monday and next wednesday ' the next week will be busy with space walks so not much tweeting from here , ' @entity3 astronaut @entity30 tweeted from space soon after the decision was announced			1
the spacewalks are taking priority over the launch of a supply ship from @entity52			2
the commercial delivery had been scheduled for this week , but is now delayed until at least mid-january			2
half of the station 's cooling system shut down last wednesday , forcing the six - man crew to turn off all nonessential equipment , including some science experiments			0
because of the valve failure , one of the two cooling lines became too cold			0
the space station cooling system , which runs ammonia through the lines , is critical for dispelling heat generated by on - board equipment			2
what a view ! after working for days without success to fix a cooling system problem that crippled the @entity6 , @entity3 has announced that a decision has been made to proceed with spacewalks in an effort to fix the problem externally if anyone can fix it , this man can : expedition 38 astronauts @entity30 and rookie @entity79 will attempt to remove an ammonia pump module on the station 's starboard side and replace it with one of three spares @entity86 , we have a problem : the space agency confirmed tuesday afternoon the launch of a cargo resupply mission whose rocket rolled to its @entity52 launch pad tuesday morning would be postponed until january go - time : the decision to do a spacewalk came after efforts to regulate temperatures in one of the station 's two external loops apparently were unsuccessful heading out : astronaut @entity30 , @entity102 flight engineer , will be one of those who will take part in the spacewalk while the astronauts are safe and comfortable , @entity3 wants the system back up to full strength , in case of another failure that could leave the orbiting outpost even more vulnerable than it is right now			1
flight controllers tried in vain to fix the valve remotely , then came up with a plan to use another valve to regulate the temperature			2
some success was reported , and for a while , engineers thought the space station could limp along with the short - term solution			0
but on tuesday , managers opted for spacewalks right now			0
this is the same pump that was replaced by a pair of spacewalking astronauts in 2010			2
three spacewalks were needed then			0
@entity30 and astronaut @entity32 trained for just such a repair before rocketing into orbit			0
they have been prepping all week , just in case of just such a decision			0
@entity137 , meanwhile , will stand down from its planned thursday night launch of its @entity140 cargo ship from @entity141 , @entity52			0
the station crew includes three @entity143 and one @entity144 , aside from the two @entity16			0
upside down you 're turning me : the spacewalks will repeat procedures performed three years ago in the same location when the previous pump module failed for different reasons a picture of @entity153 taken by the @entity6 by night			1

astronauts will perform three spacewalks to try to remove ammonia pump module
the spacewalks are scheduled for saturday , monday and @entity36
attempts to regulate temperatures in one of the external loops were unsuccessful
cargo resupply mission , scheduled for this week , will be postponed until january
@entity6 has a mass of almost a *million* *pounds* and is the size of a *football* field
@entity3 says it is *confident* the *habitat* is safe to stay in orbit until 2028 , and possibly much longer
