@entity0 are increasingly confident @entity1 will be fit to face @entity2 in the crunch @entity4 clash on thursday			1
he trained fully with the team on monday and worked in team formation in attack with @entity10 in a major boost for their hopes of progressing into the knockout stages after the damaging defeat by @entity16			1
@entity17 was tight - lipped after monday 's training session , but admitted : ' it is a possibility			1
we can say nothing more			0
' video : scroll down to watch @entity1 promising fans his knee is getting better ready to go : @entity1 returned to @entity0 training and is confident that he can play against @entity2 distraught : @entity1 ca n't watch as his @entity0 falter at their first @entity4 hurdle against @entity16 helpless : all @entity1 could do is scream at his team - mates from the bench as three changes came but not for him @entity1 's presence would be a significant boost for @entity0 , who looked toothless in his absence			2
the striker watched from the bench during the shock defeat on saturday to @entity40 's least - fancied side , and looked close to tears as @entity0 fell victim to the @entity4 's most surprising result so far			1
the @entity44 forward warmed up during the second half , but , despite @entity17 's insistence that he would not have been on the bench unless he was fit , did not come on during in the defeat			0
but @entity0 are confident the @entity50 's top scorer will be available for the all - or - nothing clash with @entity2			0
warm up : @entity1 ran up and down the line during the @entity16 defeat but was not brought on @entity1 , who it was also revealed on monday is not in contact with his teammates in the @entity2 squad , scored 31 league goals last season as @entity44 narrowly missed out on the title , and is a talisman for his country			0
but after injuring himself on the final day of the @entity50 season , @entity1 's @entity4 would have beeen in danger of ending before it has started if he failed to get fully fit by thursday .			2
