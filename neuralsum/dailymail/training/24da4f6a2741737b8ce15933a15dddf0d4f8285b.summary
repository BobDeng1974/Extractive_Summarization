botched circumcision procedures in remote parts of @entity2 are killing young men to such an extent that it has been labelled ' genocide ' by a local health official			1
the initiation , from youth to adulthood , is carried out as a cultural tradition across the country			0
but this year alone , 39 young men have died from unsafe operations in the @entity14 , and over the last seven years , there have been 462 reported deaths			1
young men are dying at such an extent following botched initiation circumcisions that the problem has been labelled a ' genocide '			1
pictured , a young @entity2 boy , in his initiation robes and paints , in @entity25 the problem has reached such crisis levels that the @entity14 's health authority is looking into setting up facilities manned by surgeons and other medical staff to safely carry out the procedure			1
@entity34 , spokesman for the @entity35 , told @entity36 : ' the custom has nothing to do with an actual surgical procedure , it will remain a custom but it 's the cutting of the boys that is important			2
how this is done needs to be closely looked at as some boys are getting infected and ending up in hospital			0
' this is very close to genocide , ' he said			0
this view was mirrored by senior traditional leader @entity50 who was quoted in @entity51 as saying the death rate could be called ' genocide as our people are slashed to death in these mountains '			0
the main cause of hospital admission is septicaemia			0
in the last seven years , 5,000 young men have been admitted to hospitals in @entity2 suffering complications after their circumcision procedure			1
it is also the main cause of death			0
for those who survive , they must live with the embarrassment and humiliation of being permanently deformed			0
there is also a strong belief still , in parts of @entity2 , that those who succumb to problems during initiation are not real men , according to survivor @entity79 , who has shrugged aside mockery to write about his experiences			2
@entity14 's health authority is looking into setting up circumcision facilities to safely carry out the procedures , particularly where the death toll is highest			1
pictured , a painted @entity25 awaits his initiation now , in a bid to prevent and epidemic of septicaemia among young men , the authorities are getting involved			1
at the start of the initiation season , the @entity93 allocated 20m rands ( £ 1.32million ) to curb initiation deaths			0
some of it was used to assist the monitoring and evaluation of the process , but there was little impact on the death toll , according to @entity36			0
the head of the @entity14 's health department , @entity105 , now wants to look into placing permanent facilities to specialise in carrying out the procedure , especially where the death toll is the highest			1
he points out the dire health economics of the current situation , with every patient admitted to hospital costing the authority 1,000 rands ( £ 65.90 )			2
@entity2 's @entity14 has recorded 39 deaths so far this year from botched circumcision procedures			1
the main cause of death is septicaemia the number of men dying every year is also increasing , so the need to implement a plan to prevent this ' genocide ' is urgent			2
@entity125 , parent of deceased 14 - year - old initiate @entity126 , told @entity36 : ' anything that can help us will be great			0

in the @entity14 , 39 young men have died this year alone from complications following the procedure
