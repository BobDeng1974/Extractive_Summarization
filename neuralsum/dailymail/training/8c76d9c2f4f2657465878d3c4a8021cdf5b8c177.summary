by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 03:00 est , 30 september 2012 not tolerated : police have staged a crackdown on ' offensive clothing ' worn by revellers in the seaside town long known as a place where teenagers booze and rowdy stag and hen parties flock to , @entity6 has battled with its reputation as a raucous destination			1
now the seaside town is taking drastic to wipe its streets of drunken louts - by banning the mankini			1
police say a decision to ban the revealing one piece and other ' inappropriate clothing ' from their town has helped significantly reduce anti-social behaviour and recorded crime			1
officers in @entity6 say the @entity27 resort is shedding its reputation as a haven for drunken revellers and stag parties as a result of the zero - tolerance approach to risque fancy dress			1
the news comes as a delight for locals who regularly see men squeezing themselves into the skimpy suit in their home town			2
some visitors to @entity6 , including children as young as 15 , have been sent home as a result of anti-social behaviour , while older fun - seekers have had skimpy costumes seized by police - including mankinis , a thong - like male bathing costume popularised by comedian @entity52 ’s spoof documentary character @entity53			1
in an interview marking the end of a successful summer season , @entity54 and @entity56 superintendent @entity55 said the town had come a long way in the last three years , thanks to concerted efforts to help clean up the town ’s reputation			2
' we have had this consistency of seizing inappropriate items of clothing , sending people home to get changed , and that has worked , it has made a real difference , this ‘ no - nonsense attitude ’ , ' said the 47 - year - old			2
' @entity77 is what we term ‘ offensive clothing ’ , so we wo n’t accept people wearing them			0
party time : revellers on stag and hen dos are warned to tone down their fancy dress if they want to stay in the town , pictured police have reported a reduction in ' hideous ' costumes and subsequently a drop in crime in the @entity27 resort ' is it just me , but if you were living in @entity98 for example , or @entity100 , is that something you would wear to walk into town on a saturday afternoon ? no. ' they are just revolting , there is nothing pleasant about seeing anybody in a mankini			1
we have had a real crackdown on the fake penises			0
' and people are getting that message			0
you look at the images you see of @entity6 now , 2009 is three years ago and we are in a very different place			1
' the tough stance has been part of the award - winning @entity120 campaign , which was launched in the summer of 2009 following the deaths of two teenagers who died following separate , drink - fuelled nights out in the town			1
residents - many of whom were angry at @entity6 ’s apparent descent from a family - friendly holiday destination in the 1970s to its image as a modern - day @entity130 for drinkers - marched on the council buildings in an impassioned plea to ' take our town back ' from the clutches of anti-social tourists			1
a group of angry parents at @entity141 protest over the number of rowdy drunk revellers who fill the streets and bars of @entity6 during the summer months local residents are delighted that the @entity27 resort is shedding its reputation as a haven for drunken revellers as a result of the zero tolerance to risque fancy dress ' there was a lot of anger , that for us was a real turning point and threw it into sharp focus , ' said @entity160			1
' it was just the constancy of what was happening , the ongoing situation			0
i ’ve always been shocked at the number of families that come on holiday but do n’t all go home as a family			0
' to have that number of incidents was a shock for all of those involved			0
it was a real catalyst for change			0
' @entity120 drew praise from @entity179 ministers for its involvement of residents , businesses and local authorities , and gave birth to a number of initiatives designed to cut crime			0
police regularly called parents across @entity190 to collect their drunken children in the middle of the night , seizing alcohol and , in some cases , banning stag and hen parties from going into the resort			1
long regarded as a destination for raucous stag and hen parties , @entity6 was infamous for groups of boozing teenagers running around the town ' i remember one of our @entity205 said a 16 - year - old boy had 64 cans of super-strength lager at 2pm , ' said @entity160			1
' but the mother had a real go at the police saying they had ruined the boy ’s fun			2
' but it is n’t fun if you see the immediate harm a can of super-strength lager can cause a 16 - year - old , let alone 64 between five of them			2
' there is an attitude of ‘ what goes on tour , stays on tour ’ , that that ’s ok , but it is not			0
' and superintendent @entity55 , the mother of boys aged 14 and 11 , said some parents ’ attitudes have contributed to the problems associated with anti-social behaviour among drunken teenagers			2
' you get adults dropping their children off with , literally , a boot full of alcohol , and they say : ‘ i ’d rather know what they are drinking ’ , ' she said			2
save the seaside resort ! @entity6 was a very difficult place a few years ago but now ' the town is on the cusp of real change ' according to superintendent @entity55 ' wait - you think they are going to spread that out over the course of a week ? it will be gone in the first 36 hours			1
it is that whole change in culture with parents that i think has been one of the issues			2
' superintendent @entity55 said some parents have contacted police on the assumption that ' we are providing a baby - sitting service ' , while others have asked for advice on whether their child is staying in a ' decent ' area of town			1
but officers say the message is finally getting through to many			0
reported crime during the summer season fell by one - fifth this year compared with 2009 , while reports of anti-social behaviour dropped from 685 in the summer of 2009 to 286 this season			0
this was partly attributed to additional police officers to work nights in @entity6 this summer , as well as long - term schemes bearing fruit			1
' crime is considerably down and the town is on the cusp of real change , ' said @entity160			0
' you hope that message is getting through			0
' it was a very difficult place in 2009			0
i can understand the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour that the residents had , that is why we have worked very closely with them			0
' i think the challenges are to maintain that work and focus to take it forward			0
we all have a sense of pride in @entity6 and the town it wants to become			1
we wo n’t shy away from dealing with what needs to be dealt with			0
