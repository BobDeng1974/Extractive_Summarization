@entity0 was charged with child cruelty @entity0 's daughter was eight when she started having problems at school			1
' she 'd never been a high achiever , ' recalls @entity0			1
' but it was as if she was going backwards : she was finding it harder to keep up in class and she got tired very easily			2
she complained of pains in her arms and legs and bad headaches			2
' at first @entity0 , a former foundry manager for @entity12 , thought it was a temporary blip			1
but her daughter got worse			1
over the next five years there were frequent visits to doctors , yet time and again @entity0 was told there was nothing wrong - the tests all came back clear			1
eventually , three years ago , in desperation she visited dr @entity22 , an endocrinologist who runs a clinic in @entity24			1
he found her daughter lacked several important hormones , and prescribed replacements including a thyroid hormone			1
the treatment worked wonders , says @entity0 , who now runs an online educational service for children with learning difficulties from her home in @entity34			1
' my daughter was transformed			1
she became a bright and happy child			2
' within a month the headaches were gone and she 'd got her energy back			2
' little did @entity0 know , however , that this breakthrough would lead to her being charged with child cruelty , and her daughter being taken from her			1
@entity0 and her daughter had entered one of the most hotly disputed areas of medicine - the diagnosis and treatment of an underactive thyroid			1
known as hypothyroidism , the condition affects three million adults in the @entity52			2
it leads to a lack of the thyroid hormone , which helps regulate the metabolism , and causes symptoms such as low body temperature , fatigue , weight gain , depression , cold , muscle aches , headaches , and water retention			2
the condition is detected with a blood test , and most of those affected are successfully treated with a form of thyroid hormone known as @entity71			2
but as the @entity74 has previously reported , patient groups and some experts claim the blood test for it is unreliable because it measures levels of only one thyroid hormone - and there are two , @entity71 and @entity80			2
campaigners believe as many as 300,000 adults and an unknown number of children are missed by standard tests			2
the problem , as they see it , is that @entity89 doctors are advised not to give hormone replacement to people with a ' normal ' blood test even though they have typical symptoms of an underactive thyroid			2
indeed official advice is that prescribing hormones to these patients could cause long - term problems such as damage to the heart and bones			1
instead , patients report being offered psychological counselling or are given a prescription for depression			2
her daughter lacked several important hormones , and was prescribed replacements and this is where @entity0 's story turns dark			1
a year after dr @entity22 started prescribing the hormones , police and social workers suddenly arrived at her home and her weeping 14 - year - old daughter was taken into care			1
@entity0 believes the raid was triggered by a complaint by her ex-husband - her lawyer has a copy of a letter from a gp advising him to contact child protection services			1
@entity0 was arrested on suspicion of child cruelty and last month appeared before @entity128 on a charge of ' unlawfully and maliciously administering a poison or other destructive and noxious thing ' - in other words the hormones - with intent to endanger her daughter 's life			1
the prosecution said the hormones could cause heart and bone problems and dismissed the @entity142 doctor as a quack			1
last week the trial was stopped on the grounds there was no evidence for the charge			0
@entity0 is now free but her child - who can not be named for legal reasons - is in a psychiatric clinic , following a breakdown			1
this extraordinary story raises worrying questions about whether the full weight of the law should be used in disagreements between doctors and parents about how best to treat a child			0
there are obvious echoes of the @entity164 case - the boy who was taken by his parents to @entity167 from @entity168 against the advice of his doctors			0
the parents wanted him to have a brain cancer treatment not available and they , too , were imprisoned			0
@entity0 's ordeal started when her daughter was a toddler			1
' she never babbled like normal babies and by three she still was n't speaking , ' says @entity0			1
' i asked my doctor about it several times but was told there was nothing wrong			0
' the little girl was eventually diagnosed with severe oral and verbal dyspraxia - a developmental disorder that makes it hard to precisely control the mouth and tongue - and needed intensive therapy			0
but she was otherwise healthy and able to attend school			0
@entity0 and her daughter had entered one of the most hotly disputed areas of medicine - the diagnosis and treatment of an underactive thyroid then , at eight , she began to develop a range of health problems			1
as well as chronic tiredness she started to put on weight , and by nine was officially obese			1
' every day she 'd complain about bad headaches			0
most mornings her fingers would be stiff and puffy			0
' we went to see the gp and she got referred to various specialists such as a rheumatologist for the fingers , someone else for the headaches and a dietitian for the weight , and they all did tests			0
i think she may have had a thyroid test then , but they all came back negative			0
' i think part of the problem was that nobody took an overview and looked at the pattern of symptoms			0
each one was treated separately			0
for instance , she was 12 and still showing no signs of puberty , which made sense in light of the very low levels of oestrogen that dr @entity22 picked up on later , but it is also something that could contribute to tiredness			0
' i knew what a healthy child was - @entity231 , her older brother , was sporty and had no problems			1
' at the end of 2011 the family gp said that if the paediatricians could find nothing wrong with her then she was n't likely to , and there was nothing more she could do			0
so @entity0 turned to the internet			1
' as soon as i put in my daughter 's symptoms , details of treatment with thyroid and other hormones started coming up , ' she says			1
' i learned that the @entity89 test for low thyroid could show you as having a healthy level when you did n't			0
that 's because the test tells you how much of the version of the thyroid hormone known as @entity71 you have			2
but @entity71 has to be turned into the active form called @entity80 , and some people have a problem converting @entity71 to @entity80			0
' she also learned that @entity261 countries such as @entity262 and @entity142 had lower thresholds for treating @entity71 deficiency			0
@entity265 , who chairs the charity @entity266 says : ' while we estimate that there are about 100 doctors in the @entity52 who are prepared to treat patients with symptoms but supposedly ' healthy ' levels according to the blood test , most are not prepared to treat children in this situation for fear of legal proceedings			0
' a sympathetic private doctor in the @entity52 put @entity0 in touch with dr @entity22 in 2011 when her daughter was nearly 14			1
' he ran blood tests that had not been done in the @entity52 , ' she says			0
dr @entity22 told the @entity74 : ' as well as a low level of thyroid hormone , i found she was not making enough oestrogen or cortisol			2
being short of any of these would be enough to make you feel very tired and explained other symptoms like low mood and constipation			0
' he is critical of the official @entity52 approach			0
' there , doctors only treat thyroid deficiency when it reaches around 70 per cent , but in @entity261 many start to treat at the 25 per cent mark			0
@entity52 hormone specialists do n't listen to what patients are telling them about their symptoms , they just tell them if they are deficient or not and that 's it			2
' @entity0 began treating her daughter with the hormones and some mineral and vitamin supplements prescribed by dr @entity22			1
' it all cost several thousand pounds - it was worth it			0
' the hormones - a thyroid extract used for more than 100 years , oestrogen and cortisol - were the ' poison or other destructive and noxious thing ' that formed the basis of the charge @entity0 was attempting to harm her daughter			1
' if i was going to poison her there are lots of cheaper ways to do it , ' says @entity0 wryly			1
the transformation in her daughter was ' wonderful - she slept well			2
even patches of eczema that would flare up disappeared			0
her education got back on track ' and then suddenly it was all taken away from her			0
' if only they had talked to me and the doctor involved first , ' says @entity0			1
' then we could have discussed it and worked out what was best for my daughter			1
if the @entity89 doctors had insisted that the hormones be stopped then i would have said ' ok , let 's do it for three months and then reassess '			1
' ' instead they did something very harmful to both of us			0
' for their part , @entity52 hormone experts are confident their tests are reliable			0
' we have very robust methods for detecting if someone is hormone deficient in this country and the same diagnostic criteria apply to teenagers and adults , ' says dr @entity355 , endocrinologist and president of the @entity357			2
' so if a patient has tested and been found not to need replacement , giving them unnecessary hormone treatment or supplements could do damage in the long term			2
' a patient requires a diagnoses but sometimes there is no clear diagnoses and it is only possible to say that an endocrine cause has been excluded			0
it is difficult to explain reports of symptom benefit			0
sometimes there may be a placebo effect which may only be temporary			0
in other patients , symptoms spontaneously improve with no intervention			0
assessing each case individually and holistically is important			0
