with their exit from the @entity3 against @entity4 , @entity1 's attention now rests solely on their @entity6 campaign			1
supporters wo n't expect @entity8 to be winning any silverware this season , but a top four finish is a must for a club that invested heavily in the summer			2
is that now a realistic possibility , though ? @entity1 have n't beaten a side currently in the top half of the @entity6 since their home win against @entity19 in mid december last year			1
@entity1 face a testing final 10 games in the @entity6 , they 'll play all of their rivals @entity8 has won less than half of his games against side 's in the top six of the @entity6 to make matters worse , they now face the prospect of playing four of the top six in their next five games ( and all of them before the end of the season )			1
with @entity19 just a point behind @entity1 in the league , and @entity36 a further two points behind them , @entity33 knows he ca n't afford to slip up			1
his record against the top six , though , is not especially encouraging			0
a fortuitous win at @entity4 and comfortable victory against an out - of - form @entity19 are the only notable moments			2
monday 's @entity3 tie proves the @entity44 will be no pushover and @entity19 are unbeaten in the league since their loss at @entity48 in 2014			0
with just 10 games to go until the end of the campaign - half are away from home and half are against direct rivals - @entity33 and his side will need to show considerably better form to secure @entity58 football next season			1
after @entity61 's red card against @entity4 , @entity1 will be without their record signing for the next match @entity1 will have to stop the league 's most in - form striker when they face @entity36 in their next game @entity36 ( @entity67 ) - sunday march 15 these two sides drew 0 - 0 at @entity69 earlier in the season but with the @entity6 's most in - form striker among @entity36 ' ranks this will be a stern test for @entity1 , who will be without the suspended @entity61			1
@entity19 ( a ) - sunday march 22 a formidable proposition for @entity33			0
@entity19 have n't lost in the league in three months and have won nine of their last 11 matches			0
@entity80 ( @entity67 ) - saturday april 4 a month ago @entity1 fans would have considered this an easy win but @entity84 has reinvigorated @entity80 , who have now won their last two games in all competitions			2
@entity19 have not lost a @entity6 game since they were beaten by @entity1 in december 2014 @entity1 still have to host their fiercest rivals , and @entity6 champions , @entity90 @entity90 ( @entity67 ) - sunday april 12 @entity1 lost to their rivals 1 - 0 at the @entity92 , @entity90 are n't in the most convincing spell of form but they are the @entity6 champions nonetheless			1
@entity95 ( a ) - saturday april 18 away at the league leaders			0
this is n't a match @entity33 can rely on getting anything from			0
@entity100 ( a ) - sunday april 26 @entity100 have struggled this season but @entity102 is always a difficult place to go , as @entity1 know well from recent history			2
a trip to league leaders @entity95 will be arguably the most difficult challenge of @entity1 's season @entity4 's win at @entity48 in the @entity3 quarter - final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts @entity114 ( @entity67 ) saturday may 2 arguably the easiest of their remaining games , but @entity118 will make sure @entity114 do n't go down without a fight			1
@entity120 ( a ) - saturday may 9 @entity121 's @entity120 are a force to be reckoned with at @entity123			0
@entity4 can testify to that - the @entity44 were fortunate to escape with three points when they visited and so will @entity1			0
@entity4 ( @entity67 ) - saturday may 16 @entity127 's side are in fine form and their win at @entity48 in the @entity3 quarter - final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts			2
@entity133 ( a ) - sunday may 24 after an abysmal start to the season , @entity135 's side are finally finding some form and have only lost once in their last five matches .			0

@entity1 have to face @entity36 , @entity19 , @entity90 and @entity95 in their next five games ( and @entity4 later down the line )
@entity8 has just 10 games left to save @entity1 's season
have n't beaten a side currently in the top half of the table since december
