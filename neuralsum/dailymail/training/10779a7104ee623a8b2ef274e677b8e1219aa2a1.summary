by @entity0 i ’m standing in @entity2 as jostling customers browse for handbags and flick through rails of summer dresses			1
they are not looking at me , but i am watching them			1
in fact , i am photographing them , taking video clips and wiring them back to the office			2
i make a call without lifting a finger			2
i send a discreet email			2
but i attract no attention because the camera , the screen and the phone are virtually invisible			2
they are just a tiny component of my high - tech glasses			1
i am looking at the future and the people around me are oblivious			2
the long - awaited but controversial @entity26 has arrived in @entity27 , and i am testing what it can do – and not just in terms of making calls or capturing high - quality snaps to show my friends			1
i am also seeing how it stretches long - cherished ideas of privacy to breaking point			2
we have never been so conscious of snooping and spying			2
yet i have been in the law courts , loitered outside a primary school , queued for changing rooms , snooped around a bank – and with one exception only , my strange new glasses have provoked not so much as a glance of enquiry			1
the attractions of immediate communication and instant imagery are powerful ; human knowledge is expanding at an unimaginable rate			2
but from smartphones to drones the size of insects , the pace of electronic change is now so overwhelming that experts predict a reshaping of society itself – a dystopian world in which our thoughts and movements are forever available to close family and strangers alike			2
a world with no private space			2
@entity26 is at the forefront of this revolution – futuristic technology that has burst out of the laboratory and gone on sale			1
the price , £ 1,000 , is stiff but like most new technology will probably fall			2
a voice - activated cross between a smartphone and a pair of spectacles , it can take photos and videos , make phone and video calls , surf the internet , send emails , listen to music and update your diary , all while you barely twitch a muscle			2
happy snapper : @entity0 is able to film while waiting in line at a cash point on @entity40 's @entity107 welcome to @entity27 : the privacy - invading goggle glasses have now arrived in the @entity27 at a price of £ 1,000 at their new @entity114 headquarters , @entity112 staff show me how to use the new device			1
key to its operation is the screen , a tiny translucent prism suspended above the right eye			2
you swipe on the side of the frame to activate it and dictate commands starting with the words : ‘ @entity38			2
’ everything is saved on a timeline , which is found by swiping forwards and backwards			2
to go back to the menu , you scroll downwards			0
the battery lasts about a day , or 45 minutes for non-stop video recording			0
i ’m a little nervous wearing them for the first time , but no one takes a second glance as i take the tube to @entity107 , in @entity40 ’s @entity141			1
there is nothing obviously private on view in @entity2			0
but what about the changing rooms ? would my fellow shoppers be uneasy at the recording device perched on my nose ? apparently not			1
i am unchallenged – it ’s a good job this is n’t an open changing room , like at the gym			1
what about more sensitive locations ? would bank staff spot me if i tried to film inside a branch where security is supposedly tight ? first i film a cashpoint queue outside @entity160 , then i go inside			1
‘ can i help you ? ’ they ask , before guiding me to the tills			0
surely there would be more vigilance at a primary school – the sort of place where parents have found themselves banned from filming their own children at sports days			0
i sit outside the entrance and watch through the glasses as the children arrive			1
my local cinema pays no attention when i catch a screening of the newly released @entity180			0
wearing the glasses , i buy a ticket , sit down and decide to film the opening credits			1
at least @entity26 is visible , unlike the tiny surveillance cameras now available online , although the time will come when high - tech specs are indistinguishable from any other pair of glasses			1
in fact , the time will come when almost anything could contain a recording device			0
pin - ned down : @entity26 is so discreet no one notices , allowing @entity0 to capture images of people using the cash machine unchallenged taking the credit : no questions were raised when @entity0 wore the @entity26 to a screening at her local cinema , so she could record the opening credits undiscovered i take matters a step further , and visit a magistrates ’ court , choosing a seat in the public gallery			1
the rules here are draconian : there must be no pictures or filming or recording			0
so i keep @entity26 switched off			1
but magistrates , lawyers , clerks and ushers pay no attention to my headwear			1
only the @entity218 were on the ball			1
the metal detector in the foyer fails to pick up @entity26			1
but as i begin to walk in , a guard turns to me and says : ‘ is that a camera ? you will have to leave those here , if you want to go in			0
’ i am bang to rights – for once			0
@entity112 claims the glasses bring people the technology they need ‘ without distracting them from the world around them ’			1
glass has been featured in @entity234 ’s fashion pages , attracted the porn industry ( @entity112 banned an app called @entity237 ) , been spoofed by the @entity238 ( as the @entity239 ) and worn by @entity240 and @entity241			1
there is no doubting the radical potential			0
@entity244 , a surgeon at the @entity245 , broadcast live video of him operating to 13,000 medical students using @entity112 ’s specs			1
but they are also thought to be behind the footage of @entity252 ’s @entity251 apparently lighting up a joint			0
in @entity256 , some shops and cafes have banned the device , while critics have branded wearers ‘ glassholes ’			0
@entity112 has released an etiquette guide stating , rather obviously , that ‘ standing alone in the corner of a room staring at people while recording them through @entity26 is not going to win you any friends ’			1
' take them off ' : although the @entity270 metal detector failed to recognise the glasses , officials were quick to spot the camera ‘ we designed @entity26 with privacy in mind , ’ says a @entity112 spokeswoman			1
‘ the fact that @entity26 is worn above the eyes and the screen lights up when it is activated clearly signals it is in use and makes it a fairly lousy surveillance device			1
' there are other ways to record people such as pin cameras			0
@entity26 is n’t one of them			1
there are tiny remote - control drones that can manoeuvre like an insect , and contact lenses , under development by @entity112 , that are capable of taking photos			1
driverless cars will record our every journey			0
computerised watches , already in development , will monitor our state of health			0
fridges will inform a central computer when we ’re low on milk			0
finally stopped : only at the @entity218 is @entity0 asked to remove her glasses at a more basic level , cloud technology can already let friends , family – and hackers – know where you are and what you ’re up to			1
and while it is heartening to know we can be tracked and rescued by mobile phone signals , it also means we are never truly alone			0
odd behaviour , curious facial expressions , stray looks – these are increasingly captured and broadcast in myriad forums , from @entity324 to @entity325			0
imagine that five-fold – or 25-fold			0
and we already spy on those closest to us			0
forty - four per cent of spouses now secretly check each other ’s text messages , according to @entity331 research , behaviour that would once have been seen as a serious breach of privacy			0
neuroscientist professor @entity335 warns that human identity itself is under threat as electronic devices cause changes in the brain ’s microcellular structure			0
‘ it ’s pretty clear that the screen - based , two - dimensional world that so many teenagers – and a growing number of adults – choose to inhabit is producing changes in behaviour			0
attention spans are shorter , personal communication skills are reduced and there ’s a marked reduction in the ability to think abstractly , ’ she has said			0
and that can affect even our closest relationships			0
‘ @entity26 raises the spectre of society ’s loss of privacy , since you never know when someone might be videotaping or recording you , ’ says @entity357 , professor of sociology at @entity359 , @entity360			1
‘ a huge concern is the lack of control people have over their own persona , as your online identity becomes an agglomeration of people you know , products you have bought and websites you have visited , leaving a digital trail followed by data - hungry corporations			0
’ in @entity382 ’s recent bestseller @entity383 , his characters ’ every move is videoed and streamed live			0
only the toilet cubicle is spared the camera ’s all - seeing eye			0
is his fiction so far from the future we now face ? additional reporting : @entity394			0

@entity0 tests @entity26 on the streets of @entity40
she was able to film in changing rooms , in banks and magistrates court
only the @entity218 spotted the @entity112 glasses
