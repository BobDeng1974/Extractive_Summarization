at a political event in @entity2 , @entity3 , on thursday , president @entity0 devoted only 40 seconds to the shooting down of the @entity6 airline , his first statement to the world following the news			1
his emotionless reference to the attack as ‘ a terrible tragedy ’ seemed disconnected from the horrific moment , particularly as he immediately reverted to script to praise his administration and criticise @entity16			1
it was a far cry from president @entity19 ’s 1983 fierce denunciation of the @entity21 shooting down of a @entity23 airliner as a ‘ crime against humanity ’			1
the commander in chief went beyond safety and said : ‘ we have been very clear to the @entity46 regime … that a red line for us is [ when ] we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilised			1
’ the term ‘ red line ’ is the kind of clear , emphatic language major powers use only when they are prepared to back words with action			1
a little over a year later , the @entity46 regime utilised chemical weapons against its own people			1
the number of blunders that the president and his administration committed in the ‘ red line ’ affair is hard to fathom			1
before the president spoke , no one vetted the term and its consequences in the @entity37 policy process and , once the words came out , no one undertook preparations in case @entity41 president @entity46 called mr @entity0 ’s bluff			1
according to reports , no one made the diplomatic rounds to line up the support of allies just in case , or the congressional rounds to line up the support of @entity82			1
no one developed military plans or sent quiet signals to @entity46 that the @entity34 was not to be trifled with on this matter			1
these actions are routine when any @entity37 makes as definitive a commitment as the president made , except , apparently , this @entity37			1
even bigger blunders came after the @entity41 chemical attack			1
mr @entity0 began signalling that , despite his remark , he did not want a response , any response			1
first there was the verification charade			2
multiple eyewitness accounts of rockets rising out of @entity41 army installations and falling into the stricken zones at the time of the chemical attacks were not enough to warrant quick action			2
then there was his call for a congressional vote , delivered just when the need to respond was most urgent if air strikes were to deliver an effective message			2
back to politics : he immediately reverted to script to praise his administration and criticise republicans finally , there was the utter failure to attract congressional support , assuming mr @entity0 really wanted @entity82 to endorse the proposed attacks			1
that the @entity121 of our closest ally , @entity124 , rejected an air campaign first gave mr @entity0 an additional reason for inactivity			1
the flailing seemed to end when @entity129 president @entity128 opened the door to a negotiated deal with @entity41			2
but it was not the end ; it was the beginning			2
for as the administration rushed to that door , all over the world those who depended on @entity140 when in harrowing circumstances were asking themselves : how reliable is @entity140 now ? how strong now ? also asking was mr @entity128			1
he noted the contrast between mr @entity0 ’s bold talk and timid response			1
as the former head of a friendly government said in a small meeting i attended not long ago : ‘ @entity128 is cautious			2
if he encounters resistance , he will pull back			2
’ the @entity34 failure to follow through in @entity41 gave the @entity129 president confidence that he could move with impunity			2
soon he was picking a fight with @entity153			2
like the scene in @entity155 – when , at his child ’s baptism , @entity156 renounces the devil as the camera cuts back and forth to his men eliminating rival gangsters – @entity128 , before global television cameras , watched the opening ceremonies of the @entity165 as @entity129 troops began movements preparatory to seizing @entity168			0
this week , in the skies over @entity153 , we saw the consequences of the recklessness that the @entity129 godfather ’s probing has unleashed			0
@entity128 was not the only one to detect opportunity in @entity34 indecision			0
@entity176 stepped up its probes in the @entity178 and @entity179			0
in the @entity178 , with the @entity34 military presence drawn down nearly to zero in @entity181 and soon @entity182 , an army of ruthless fanatics gestating unnoticed in @entity41 ’s east saw the chance to break out of national boundaries and within a few weeks occupied much of western and central @entity181			0
why has so much of the global order come apart so fast ? for the same reason that , as a friend reports , on the streets of @entity195 those who will smuggle your child to the @entity193 have been securing an unprecedented volume of sign - ups			0
when asked about the chances of the child staying in @entity140 once the border is crossed , they tell parents : ‘ it has never been easier			0
’ now the word on weakness is everywhere , even the poorest barrios of @entity140			0
consequences : the current @entity37 does n’t understand how @entity34 fecklessness in @entity41 can reverberate to @entity153 ‘ the fact that you have a crisis in @entity153 has nothing to do with @entity215 , ’ a deputy national security adviser to the president told an interviewer recently			1
the current @entity37 does n’t understand how @entity34 fecklessness in @entity41 can reverberate to @entity153 , and from there to the @entity179 , and the @entity218 , and @entity215 and elsewhere in the @entity178			0
in all this i have referred to the @entity34 as the primary shaper of world events , which is , in fact , a misleading shorthand			0
the @entity34 is not a superpower so much as the biggest player in a set of super-alliances , the most critical of which is with the @entity228			0
since the @entity230 , when the @entity34 and @entity124 have been of one mind , liberal values have been secure and even advanced			0
when either has lost its sense of direction , neither has been nearly so effective			0
the great danger in being the anchor to the global order is that when we lose our way the general peace itself is threatened			0
this is just what we are seeing in theatre after theatre around the world			0
perhaps it is time for a key ally like prime minister @entity249 to have a friendly talk with the president			0
it is not just @entity34 interests that a flailing @entity37 threatens			0
it is that of peoples everywhere .			0

immediately ' reverted to script ' to praise his administration
