@entity1 ’s social life may now be focus of more speculation than the footballing future of @entity5 , but make no mistake – saturday ’s rush of blood to the head was all about football and had nothing to do with the @entity14 star 's life off the pitch			1
the best evidence of that came as he walked off the pitch at @entity22 ’s @entity21 stadium on saturday brushing the dust from the @entity25 badge on his @entity14 shirt			2
his supporters will say it was an act of defiance			0
his critics will say it was one of arrogance but neither will argue it was n’t rooted firmly in football which is all @entity1 cares about from the moment he steps off the team coach to the moment he gets back on it			2
@entity1 lashes out at @entity40 while @entity14 were chasing a late winner the @entity14 superstar 's customised @entity1 boot clearly makes contact with the defender 's leg @entity1 appears to claim there is nothing wrong as the defender goes down shamefully clutching his face @entity1 is reportedly dating tv presenter @entity51 ( right ) after his split from @entity53 ( left ) the split with @entity56 model @entity53 and speculation that @entity1 is now dating @entity14 tv presenter @entity51 will have been a million miles from his mind when he hit - out at @entity60			1
@entity63 , speaking to @entity62 media @entity61 , talks about the family ’s hope that he finds a woman who ‘ loves and respects him ’ and who also denied the link to @entity71 , will not have been what was troubling him as kicked @entity74 with eight minutes left of @entity14 ’s hard - fought win over @entity22			1
when football ’s most focused player loses it , it is only ever about the game			0
it was the fifth red card of his six - year career in @entity83 and much like the one 13 months ago against @entity84 it will have been born out of frustration at perceived lack of refereeing protection and perhaps even more importantly at the ineptitude of @entity14 ’s performance against inferior but supremely motivated opposition			1
surprise surprise @entity1 hates not winning			1
he has scored against 27 of the 29 teams he has faced in @entity83			0
@entity40 , along with @entity93 are the only one to have resisted him			2
@entity95 match reporter @entity94 called it ‘ his worst game since signing in 2009 ’ and while that might have been stretching it , the performance was summed up by the degree to which @entity99 was overshadowing him on the other side by showing all the pace and flair that made @entity104 gamble on his signing , as well as all the misplaced crossing and shooting that helped ensure he was never a success at @entity109			2
@entity99 overshadowed fellow former @entity104 player winger during the @entity114 clash @entity104 flop @entity99 , pictured with @entity116 , impressed against @entity14 @entity99 attempts to win back possession from @entity14 right back @entity118 @entity1 and @entity14 also felt aggrieved by the match referee who gave a first minute penalty when @entity99 ’s shot hit @entity123 thigh and cannoned up on to his arm making it completely accidental			1
@entity123 himself should have been given a penalty shortly after when @entity60 held him down in the area			0
the same player could be seen holding @entity1 at various set - plays and it is he who received the first of @entity1 ’s right - handers – the one the referee does n’t spot			1
@entity74 , who was kicked by @entity1 for the sending off said after the game , said : ‘ he had become a bit hot - headed because things were not working out for him			1
' things were not going right for the team and he had become a bit nervous because he was n’t able to do what he normally does			0
he crossed the line but it 's gone and forgotten			0
i hope he gets just a normal ban and nothing more			0
’ what is ' normal ' will be decided by @entity83 football 's disciplinary committee who usually sit on tuesday			0
the referee ’s report does not mention him striking @entity60 in the face after the kick and neither does it call the incident ' violent conduct ' so a two - game ban is most likely			0
@entity1 raises his arm as @entity22 defender @entity159 moves closer following his kick at @entity161 the committee could ask mr @entity163 to ' elaborate ' on his brief summary of the incident and if he chooses to include the slap on @entity60 then the ban could run to three games			2
if that sounds a bit amateur - hour bear in mind a year ago the referee actually changed his report post-match			0
first he said he had sent @entity1 off for striking @entity175 then he said it was because he had hit out at @entity177			2
so it is possible the referee could add some misdemeanours to the list which would make for a longer ban			0
if @entity1 is given a three - match ban it will include @entity14 ’s trip to the @entity185 in the league to play @entity187			1
@entity14 will need their talisman there more than ever			0
could the player ’s moment of madness actually cost them the title ? @entity1 will be reflecting on that on sunday morning			0
but no one at @entity14 will be turning the drama into a crisis			0
@entity197 has already said : ‘ the team has shown it can cope without certain key players , even when we have been without him [ @entity1 ]			1
’ @entity201 actually congratulated @entity40 for their performance , saying they made @entity14 ' suffer '			1
no one was suffering more than @entity1 and he reacted , as he has done before - four times before - with some costly petulance			1
in a final act of petulance , @entity1 takes a backhand swipe at @entity211 before being shown the red card @entity1 can only offer a nonchalant shrug as referee @entity163 shows him a red card @entity1 appeared to look at the badge on his shirt as he left the field and passed coach @entity201 @entity1 heads into the dressing room with the game still balanced at 1 - 1 in the race for the @entity114 title			1

@entity14 star @entity1 was sent off in the 82nd minutes
his side were drawing 1 - 1 with @entity40 when he was shown a red card
@entity197 saved @entity1 's *blushes* with late match - winning penalty
@entity1 is no longer dating @entity56 model @entity53
