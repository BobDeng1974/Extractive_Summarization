it is n't often @entity1 are compared to @entity2 , but that is exactly what @entity5 boss @entity4 did when accusing the @entity8 side of ' aggressive tactics '			1
@entity4 made the comments ahead of wednesday night 's crucial @entity12 last - 16 clash at @entity13 after a feisty 1 - 1 draw in the first leg			1
he said : ' i was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls			0
@entity4 says @entity1 are the most aggressive team @entity5 have played this season former @entity22 defender @entity21 goes in hard on @entity23 during the first leg at the @entity25 @entity1 play @entity5 at @entity13 in a @entity12 last - 16 second leg on wednesday night fouls committed in the @entity12 this season @entity5 87 @entity1 83 @entity28 17 @entity29 * 15 * highest ranked @entity1 player ' this season we 've played against sides form the @entity34 in the cups , against teams from @entity37 , and @entity2 from @entity38 , but the most aggressive team was @entity1			1
' @entity40 was often the victim at the @entity25 , though @entity41 has also claimed @entity42 is capable of ' dirty tricks ' and has told the referee to watch out			1
it promises to be a tough night for @entity46			0
not only with @entity1 , but with @entity5 - who have committed more fouls than @entity1 in the competition this season - and @entity28 , whose foul - count is higher than any of @entity41 's players			1
but as the two teams look to reach the quarter - finals , who are the @entity1 players @entity4 feels so strongly about ? are they more aggressive than those in a @entity38 side ? visit @entity59 for more @entity12 stats and facts @entity29 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) double up to take down @entity40 during the first leg in @entity64 @entity21 and @entity65 graceful , skillful , blessed with flair ; those are the characteristics usually associated with @entity69 footballers ... but not these two defenders			1
their rugged approach against @entity5 in the first leg angered the visiting players			2
that was especially case with former @entity22 defender @entity21			2
the unconventional centre back was obviously eager to make a point to @entity4 , who sold him for a staggering fee of £ 50million in the summer			0
@entity21 operated in midfield in @entity64 and clattered into @entity40 and @entity23 , as well as going head - to - head with @entity42			1
he is set to operate further back on wednesday night , so will look to join forces with @entity65 and get on @entity42 's nerves again			2
@entity21 and @entity65 ( right , sporting a black eye ) will be looking to dominate @entity42 at @entity13 @entity21 tugs back @entity23 ( left ) and squares up to @entity42 ( right ) during the first leg @entity87 in a midfield three that usually sees tough - tacklers @entity89 and @entity29 surround him , @entity87 - who has been compared to @entity91 - is often looked at as the ' nice guy '			1
but the @entity94 youngster showed he had a bit of the @entity96 about him as he launched into tackles against @entity5 last month			0
one in particular , on @entity40 once again , should have resulted in a red card for the 22 - year - old			0
his passing range and balance on the ball is something to be admired , but @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity40 should be wary of more late lunges from @entity87 and co. @entity87 is not known for his tackling ability but could have seen red for this challenge on @entity40 the @entity94 midfielder went in with his studs up and caught @entity40 over the top of the ball @entity113 ' even a player like @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , a typical attacking player – came back when they lost the ball and attacked @entity40 from behind when we were countering , ' @entity4 claimed in his press conference on tuesday			2
the controversial striker may not be regarded as much of a team player and rarely defends from the front with his running , but it is evident he will do what it takes to win			0
the @entity126 has been sent off 10 times in his club career , with offences including slapping a player in the face			0
he has only just returned to action after serving a two - game ban after going in studs - up , over the top of the ball against @entity136			0
@entity113 comes from behind to take down @entity40 ... will he be in that mood again at @entity13 ?			0

@entity5 boss @entity4 says @entity1 are the most aggressive side his team have played this season
@entity22 host @entity8 *giants* in @entity12 last - 16 second leg
@entity41 also claims @entity5 have ' dirty tricks ' with @entity42
@entity5 have committed more fouls than @entity1 in the competition so far
@entity21 proved he had a *ruthless* streak in him in last leg in @entity64
@entity65 , @entity87 and @entity113 are other *danger* men
