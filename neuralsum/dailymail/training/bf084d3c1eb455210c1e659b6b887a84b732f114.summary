by @entity0 for @entity1 hopes of a breakthrough in the fight against @entity5 have been raised by the 100 per cent successful treatment of monkeys with the deadly disease			1
the experimental drug @entity9 cured the animals even when administered five days after infection , while they were displaying severe symptoms			1
all 18 rhesus macaques made a complete recovery , in contrast to three other untreated monkeys that quickly fell seriously ill and died			1
new research shows the experimental drug @entity9 cured the monkeys even when administered five days after infection @entity9 is a blend of three laboratory - made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus			1
two @entity31 doctors given the drug after they were infected with @entity5 while working in @entity33 subsequently recovered			1
but it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or just lucky			2
about 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment			0
at least two other patients treated with @entity9 have died , possibly because help got to them too late			1
the new research , published in a special report on nature journal 's website , provides hard evidence that the drug works and can be highly effective			2
a team of scientists led by dr @entity49 , from the @entity50 , wrote : ' @entity9 exceeds the efficacy of any other therapeutics described so far , and results warrant further development of this cocktail for clinical use ... ' we hope that initial safety testing in humans will be undertaken soon , preferably within the next few months , to enable the compassionate use of @entity9 as soon as possible			1
' the news follows a warning from the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) that the @entity5 outbreak in @entity65 could eventually claim more than 20,000 victims			1
latest figures show 1,552 deaths from the 3,069 cases reported so far			0

latest figures show 1,552 deaths from the 3,069 cases reported so far @entity9 is being used to treat @entity77 ( left ) the first @entity78 to contract the virus while working as a nurse at a remote health centre in @entity82 and ( right ) dr @entity83 , was being treated with @entity9 but lost his battle with @entity5 this week			1
he was the deputy chief medical doctor at the country 's largest hospital @entity5 , belonging to the family of ' filoviruses ' , ranks alongside @entity89 as one of the world 's deadliest infections			1
fatality rates in previous outbreaks have been as high as 90 per cent			0
it kills by overwhelming the immune system and sending the body into shock as blood pressure drops to dangerous levels			0
currently there are is no approved vaccine or post-exposure treatment			0
management of the @entity5 outbreak in @entity65 has been confined to palliative care and physical attempts to prevent transmission			2
the development of @entity9 and its success in treating advanced stages of @entity5 infection was described as a ' monumental achievement ' by professor @entity114 , from the @entity115 , writing in @entity116			1
he added : ' the next crucial step will be to formally assess its safety and effectiveness			0
testing the latter is clearly difficult , because intentional infection of human subjects in clinical trials is not possible			2
' researchers claim the ebola virus disease ( @entity5 ) is rapidly and continually mutating , making it harder to diagnose and treat			1
a study of the initial patients diagnosed with the virus in @entity82 revealed almost 400 genetic modifications			2
and it could be detrimental not only to current treatments , but also to future vaccines that are in the works			0
the team of researchers , led by the @entity137 in @entity138 and @entity139 , analysed more than 99 ebola virus genomes			0
these were collected from 78 patients diagnosed with @entity5 in @entity143 in the first 24 days of the outbreak			1
their findings , reported in the journal @entity147 , could have important implications for rapid field diagnostic tests			0
the team found more than 300 genetic changes that make the 2014 ebola virus genomes distinct from the viral genomes tied to previous @entity5 outbreaks			1
they also found variations in the genome sequence indicating that , from the samples analysed , the outbreak started from a single introduction into humans , subsequently spreading from person to person over many months			0
the treated monkeys were exposed to a lethal level of ebola virus before receiving three doses of @entity9 starting three , four and five days after infection			1
the treatment reversed @entity5 symptoms including excessive bleeding , rashes , and liver damage			2
three weeks after they were infected , no trace of the virus could be detected in the animals ' blood			2
untreated monkeys all succumbed to the virus by day eight after infection			1
one drawback of the research was that it used a version of the virus different from the @entity187 strain responsible for the current outbreak , which was not available at the time			0
but the scientists went on to show that @entity9 blocks replication of the @entity187 strain in laboratory tests			2
dr @entity194 , from the @entity196 / @entity195 , said : ' what needs to be done next is assess against how many strains and species of the virus it can act			0
clinical trials in humans are not possible so some questions will go unanswered			0
at present too few people have received the drug to allow conclusions about efficacy and treatment timings , though in emergency situations it is at least one potentially useful option			0
' @entity213 , professor of virology at the @entity215 , said : ' all animals survived and had undetectable viral loads 21 days post-infection			2
this is an extremely encouraging result for a virus which has an incubation period of two to 21 days in humans and for which no vaccine exists			2
' these results do not prove that the healthcare workers who received @entity9 and recovered did so due to the therapy			1
others who also received @entity9 succumbed to the virus			1
' distinguishing between correlation and causation will require analysis of the clinical data on viral loads before and after therapy was administered			0
nevertheless , the results are encouraging			0
' professor @entity237 , from the @entity238 , said : ' this looks to be a very well designed study with better than expected results , which give great hope for future clinical trials			0
' i hope the team can receive sufficient funding to undertake these clinical trials straight away as this is by far the most advanced potential treatment option available to my knowledge			0
' what is ebola virus disease ? @entity5 is a severe , often fatal illness , with a death rate of up to 90 per @entity254 illness affects humans as well as primates , including monkeys , gorillas and chimpanzees			1
how do people become infected with the virus ? @entity5 is transmitted through close contact with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals			1
in @entity65 infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees , gorillas , fruit bats , monkeys , forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest			1
once a person becomes infected , the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer 's blood , urine , saliva , stools and semen			0
a person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim 's soiled clothing , bed linen or used needles			0
men who have recovered from the disease , can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery			1
who is most at risk ? those at risk during an outbreak include : what are the typical signs and symptoms ? sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			0
that is followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding			0
the incubation period is between two and 21 days			0
a person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms			0
when should you seek medical care ? if a person is in an area affected by the outbreak , or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have @entity5 , they should seek medical help immediately .			2

all 18 rhesus macaques treated with the drug made ' complete recovery '
animals were cured even when given the drug five days after infection
monkeys not given the experimental drug quickly fell seriously ill and died
@entity9 is blend of three lab - made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus
two @entity31 doctors given the drug after contracting @entity5 later recovered
experts warned today the disease is mutating rapidly
