by @entity0 a mother is furious after she was ordered to leave a cinema showing a 15 - rated film because she had her baby daughter with her			1
@entity5 was told she was ' breaking the law ' by taking her baby to raunchy comedy @entity8 - even though the 11 - week - old girl is too young to understand any film			1
the cinema now says that she should never have been sold a ticket , as age limits are strictly enforced even for infants			1
anger : @entity5 was thrown out of the @entity17 in @entity18 along with her 11 - week - old daughter the 30 - year - old mother of two had gone to the @entity17 in @entity18 with a friend , and both had bought tickets but were asked to leave before the film started			1
' it was totally humiliating , we were escorted out , ' ms @entity26 said			2
' i was really looking forward to watching the movie and catching up with a friend			2
' as a new parent i do n't get out that often and it can be difficult to find things you can do with friends			2
' we were told we were breaking the law and that it was a criminal offence			1
it felt like we were being discriminated against			0
it 's never been a problem before			0
' the pair were eventually given a refund for their tickets , but only after a ' long , infuriating ' conversation with the cinema 's manager			0
raunchy : @entity8 , starring @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , is a 15 - rated comedy @entity8 is a 15 - rated film about young parents , played by @entity50 and @entity51 , who are trapped in a feud with @entity49 , playing the leader of a fraternity which has moved in next door to them			1
the film features repeated swear words , sexual innuendo and violent slapstick humour			1
however , ms @entity26 insisted that there was no reason why she should not have taken her infant daughter to the screening			1
' at just 11 weeks old my daughter is totally oblivious to what 's going on , she would have just gone off to sleep , ' she said			2
' it was a comedy not a violent film			2
' if she was screaming and interrupting everyone i would totally understand and would never stay in the cinema , but she was completely fine			0
there were only six other people in the whole room			0
' a spokesman for @entity17 said that small children were only allowed in to @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity83 - rated films , in accordance with official guidelines			1
' on this particular occasion the customer should have been advised that babies are not permitted into 15 certificate films and declined the sale , ' he said			0
' @entity91 apologises for any inconvenience caused and we are taking steps to ensure it does n't happen again in future			0
' an editor at parenting website @entity99 said that it was normal for mothers to take small children to films which they can not understand			0
' the cinema can be a great place for a new mum and a small baby as most tiny babies are unaffected by the noise and sleep throughout the film , ' @entity103 said			1
' it can feel great to get out of the house and do something " grown up "			0
however , many @entity115 recommend going to screenings designated for mums with babies			0

@entity5 , 30 , took her baby daughter to a screening of @entity8
staff at @entity17 in @entity18 sold her a ticket but then told her to leave
she says the *newborn* would just have slept through the whole film
