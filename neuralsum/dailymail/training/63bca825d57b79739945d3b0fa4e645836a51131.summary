so we 'll have to wait and see			0
it will be entirely up to him			0
' @entity4 has a year left on his current @entity3 contract , and talks over a new one have not yet been opened			1
on the prospect of the player re-signing with the midlands outfit , @entity2 said : ' to be fair to @entity4 , he has not come to us or anything			1
' we have had little chats here and there , but i think his main concern was getting back after the @entity12 , getting fit and hopefully being ready for saturday ( @entity3 's @entity14 opener at @entity49 )			1
' that is where he has been			0
i have a good rapport with @entity4 , so i do n't have any problem with that whatsoever			1
' he added : ' we have never really had a chat about it ( @entity4 staying or not )			1
i 'm pretty sure once it kind of settles down , there will be time for that			0
' i am sitting here at ease with it - it does n't really bother me at the moment			0
' i 'm sure i 'll sit with @entity66 ( @entity67 , @entity3 's owner , and discuss the situation )			2
' i 'm pretty sure things will evolve over the next few weeks or so , and we 'll see what happens			0
but at the moment i 'm totally at ease with everything , and so is @entity4			1

when on loan for the season at @entity121 in 2013/14 , @entity110 scored six goals in 30 appearances in all competitions , and @entity2 said : ' he had a bit of a barren spell even there			0
' so he is going to have to really work at it - it is not going to come easy to him			0
' even the @entity121 spell was a bit tough for him and he did n't really score that many goals			0
' it is an opportunity for him now back here and it is up to himself			0
