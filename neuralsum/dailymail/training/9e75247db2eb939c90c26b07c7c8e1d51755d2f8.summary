by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 09:09 est , 1 november 2012 a teenager who had a massive heart attack and ' died ' for seven minutes was saved thanks to the quick thinking of his teacher			1
@entity6 , 17 , collapsed after running up the stairs at college - while rushing to get to a hospital appointment			1
his heart stopped beating and the teen was technically dead - but managed to make a miraculous recovery after one of his tutors started @entity15 - giving him a fighting chance until paramedics arrived			2
thanks sir : @entity6 with teacher @entity19 who gave him cpr while waiting for paramedics tutor @entity19 desperately battled to keep him alive after calling paramedics - but after realising he had no heartbeat for more than seven minutes , feared the worst			1
after arriving at hospital , worried doctors warned his terrified parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , that they did n't know whether their sporty son would pull through - and if he did , feared he would be severely brain damaged			0
but amazingly , a month after his brush with death , @entity6 has stunned medics by making an amazing recovery - and is now recovering at home in @entity35			1
his mother , @entity26 , 40 , an @entity37 administrator , said : ' we are so grateful to everyone who has helped @entity6 pull through - we ca n't thank them enough			1
' we came so close to losing our son , we 're just so grateful that so many people knew basic first aid , and for everything the doctors have done for him			0
@entity6 's scar : he fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat ' even after @entity6 's heart had been restarted , the doctors told us they did n't know if he 'd make it through the night			1
' we were distraught - just a few hours before our healthy and happy son had been heading off to college on his moped , and now we were being told we might lose him forever			2
once his heart had been stabilised , they still said that he might have suffered bad brain damage because his heart had been stopped for so long			0
' we were told it would take a long time for him to properly wake up - but a few days later , @entity6 was sitting up in bed laughing and joking			2
' even the nurses in the hospital told us it was a miracle - he was really one of the lucky ones			0
' engineering student @entity6 had been due to attend a hospital appointment for tests after doctors told him they suspected he might have issues with his heart			2
but after running up a flight of stairs at the @entity76 , to grab his coat , the teenager suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed , on september 28			1
fortunately , one of his tutors , engineering manager @entity19 , heard him fall - and despite initially thinking that @entity6 had fainted and put him in the recovery position - but quickly realised he had no pulse and began @entity15			1
he was joined by colleagues , including community first responder @entity84 , who took over the cpr , until paramedics arrived and restarted his heart with a defibrillator			2
@entity6 said : ' i ca n't remember much about what happened			2
i felt like i was in a swimming pool and i had fallen asleep			0
i could hear the faint voices of the paramedics calling my name , but i did n't know where i was			2
' i 'm so thankful to the people who saved me - it has n't really sunk in yet how serious it was			0
' @entity6 's parents were already at @entity98 , waiting for @entity6 to arrive for his appointment when they got a call from the college to say their son was being rushed in			1
@entity26 said : ' we were completely panicked - it did n't seem real when they said @entity6 had collapsed and was in an ambulance			1
' we feared the worst , and seeing him in intensive care was devastating			0
' the doctors told us they did n't know if he would pull through - they said he was very very sick			0
' he was being kept alive by machines and was in a coma			0
' they said it would take a long time for him to wake up , but four days after it happened , he was alert and awake			0
' the nurses said there 's not many people lucky enough to survive what he did - and they said it 's a miracle he recovered as quickly as he did			0
' relieved : @entity6 with his mother @entity26 , father @entity27 and sister @entity119 @entity19 said : ' we knew that @entity6 's life was in the balance , so we all worked as hard as we could to save @entity6			1
' the paramedics were first class and reassured us we did the correct thing and that our reaction had given him a fighting chance			0
' i think someone must have been looking down on him			0
' @entity6 , who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , has now been fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat			1
the device , slightly larger than a matchbox , monitors the heart rhythm and can deliver low - voltage electrical impulses to keep the heart beating correctly and larger shocks if needed			0
@entity27 , who works in manufacturing , said : ' we are so grateful to the staff at the college , and especially to @entity19 , who realised what had happened and sprung into action so quickly			1
' we want to share @entity6 's story to encourage people to consider learning basic first aid - it 's so simple that anyone could do it , but all of @entity6 's friends have said that if he 'd collapsed in front of them , they would n't know what to do			1
' i ca n't thank the staff at the school enough for saving my son 's life - there 's no way we can repay them			0
