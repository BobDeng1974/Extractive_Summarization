@entity0 will be reunited with his former @entity2 manager @entity1 on wednesday as @entity2 ’s most famous no 7 hands the @entity4 over to the man who wore the shirt for two - and - a - half seasons at @entity2			1
as soon as the afternoon ceremony in @entity9 is over @entity0 will return to his rented home in @entity11 where he lives with his family in the same neighbourhood as coach @entity14 and team - mate @entity15			1
he will spend two days playing his usual secondary part in training sessions at @entity9 ’s @entity19 headquarters knowing that he will not be part of preparations for saturday ’s game against @entity23 which he will watch from high in the @entity24 and then it will finally be over			2
@entity0 has had to play a waiting game since joining @entity9 from @entity2 in the summer @entity1 - here with @entity0 as his @entity2 manager in october 2011 - will present the @entity4 the four - month ban issued by @entity28 for the bite on @entity30 will not be officially over until another six days but on sunday morning @entity0 will take full part in first - team training as @entity9 begin preparation for the trip to @entity35 on october 25 – a game that he is expected to start			1
it will have been 123 days since out of competitive football			0
' the first two months were the worst , ' he says in reference to the eight weeks he spent unable to train with team - mates or set foot in the @entity24			1
' i was in a little gym about 10 - metre squared with a personal trainer			0
i had to stay out of the way			0
i could n’t be photographed , ' he says speaking to @entity9 ’s in - house media			2
' it was tough but i was conscious of the fact that i had to do it for my own good			0
i had a serious knee injury before the @entity53 and only just made it back			0
all i kept thinking about was that i wanted to be at the same fitness level as my team - mates once i was allowed to start training with them			1
' @entity0 feigns injury after infamously biting @entity60 defender @entity30 during the @entity53 when his ban on all football activity was lifted by the court of arbitration in sport on august 14 , work could really begin on his comeback and the gruelling one - on - one training sessions with @entity9 fitness coach @entity69 could begin in earnest			1
off the pitch he finally moved out of his @entity2 home , vacating the house he took over from @entity74 and that now currently awaits its next famous footballing tenant			0
he moved his family briefly into his his wife ’s parents ’ house in the @entity9 coastal town of @entity81 and then to nearby @entity11 where daughter @entity82 was soon enrolled into the same @entity84 school as the children of his manager @entity14 and team - mate @entity15			1
on the pitch a behind - closed - doors friendly with the b - team was followed by a specially organised match against an @entity92 under 19 xi in which he scored twice and passed up on the chance to complete his hat - trick from the spot so that the b - team ’s pre-designated spot - kick taker could score			2
@entity0 scores past @entity99 goalkeeper @entity98 on international duty for @entity101 this week it ’s not quite @entity103 asking if he could become @entity2 ’s penalty taker when signing his contract at @entity106 this summer – @entity0 has won the instant respect of his new team - mates by the way he has fitted in patiently waiting for october 25 to come			1
after that league comeback he will play his first @entity112 game in the @entity113 against @entity114 , the only side he has represented in the competition so far in his career , and the team he captained aged 22			0
' there are a lot of coincidences , ' he says			0
' going back after so long is going to be special			0
' fitting in to life in his new home city has been made easier by his in - laws having lived there for the last 11 years			2
they know @entity9 well as does @entity0 's wife @entity128 who lived in the @entity130 capital until moving to @entity131 to live with @entity0			1
@entity0 shows off his @entity9 shirt after finally being allowed to be unveiled back in august @entity133 scores a brace for @entity135 on the training ground @entity15 and @entity136 have become drinking buddies for @entity0 – all enjoying the traditional bitter green herb @entity140 sucked from a metal straw and passed between friends			1
if the connection with @entity136 is as good on the pitch as it off it then @entity9 ’s rivals could have problems			2
@entity35 hope the three take their time to click into place			2
@entity0 looked predictably lacking in match sharpness in a series of three friendlies played for @entity9 and @entity101			1
but he also looked a long way from the " overweight ex-footballer " description given him by the @entity156 media			0
' they are running scared of the @entity0 , @entity136 , @entity159 forward line , ' responded the @entity130 press to jibes			1
@entity9 supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season will mean he makes an instant impact on his return			2
after serving his 10 - game ban for biting @entity169 scored twice in his first match back against @entity171			0
@entity0 trains with his new @entity9 team - mates after having his ban reduced and there is another older precedent : @entity176 also had a delayed debut for @entity9 after signing from @entity114 in august 1973 for 120m pesetas ( just over half a million pounds )			1
a bureaucratic problem meant the team had already played the first seven fixtures before the paperwork was in order and @entity176 could play in a 4 - 0 win over @entity184			0
the @entity185 scored twice in his first match			0
now it ’s over to @entity0 who on wednesday becomes the fifth winner of the @entity4 that @entity9 have signed			1
@entity188 won a @entity189 after signing and @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 all won the @entity112 with @entity9			0
the bar is set high but that is the way @entity0 wants it			2
the quest for trophies is about to begin .			0

@entity0 set for @entity9 debut next weekend against @entity35
@entity0 has *settled* well in to life in the @entity130 city
@entity203 has been training with his team - mates since *mid-august*
@entity0 was banned from football for four months for biting @entity30
