a senior member of an @entity2 - affiliated terror group has spoken out in support of @entity4 - the @entity5 aid worker threatened by the @entity6 following the murder of @entity8			1
@entity9 - a prominent member of the @entity11 - based @entity10 - pleaded with @entity12 to spare @entity4 's life after he identified the @entity14 convert as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds			1
@entity4 is a @entity17 who converted to @entity19 after being captured and taken prisoner by @entity12 in october last year and now calls himself @entity21			1
his life was threatened by the militant known as ' @entity24 ' earlier this month following the sickening filmed beheading of @entity8 - with @entity12 sympathisers last night claiming the terrorists plan to murder @entity4 in the coming days after a wednesday ' deadline ' for the @entity5 to stop bombing them passed			1
@entity9 ( left ) - a senior member of @entity2 - affiliated @entity10 - has identified @entity4 as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds @entity9 's unexpected intervention came in a series of messages posted on @entity40 , in which he identified @entity4 as an aid worker who ' performed a successful operation under bombardment by the regime '			1
he later explained this operation was to remove shrapnel from his leg			0
he also suggested that @entity4 had treated a number of other fighters linked to the @entity10 - including ' @entity50 ' , who is understood to be one of the regional leaders of the terror group			1
@entity9 went on to suggest that the senior @entity10 fighters had later asked after @entity4 and were surprised when ' he showed up in the video where @entity12 threatened the @entity5 ' as they had wrongly assumed him to be a @entity57 jihadist who had joined their ranks			1
' it later became clear to me that he 's an humanitarian activist that served in @entity63 for more than a year and was then kidnapped by @entity12 , ' the militant said			2
@entity4 's case has exposed deep divisions among supporters of the @entity6 , many of whom have said it would be a great sin to murder a recent muslim convert			0
both extremists who met @entity4 before he embraced @entity19 and former prisoners who were held alongside him have argued that the aid worker 's conversion is without doubt sincere			2
@entity76 's remarks on @entity40 came as @entity12 supporters said a deadline for the @entity5 to stop bombing the terror group in @entity11 and @entity80 had expired			2
they claimed @entity5 citizen @entity4 would now be murdered as a result - a statement that led to a number of arguments among the jihadists and their sympathisers on social media			2
the 26 - year - old is said to be haunted by a brief spell as a @entity5 army ranger in @entity80 in 2007 and first travelled to the @entity90 to ' give back ' to the @entity91 there			0
in late 2012 , shortly after leaving university , he founded @entity94 ( @entity93 and @entity95 ) - a non-governmental organisation providing humanitarian aid to those in desperate need - and moved to southern @entity99 to oversee the project first hand			0
with funds dwindling , @entity4 continued to make risky ventures into @entity11 by himself - even after a large number of @entity105 were kidnapped by the brutal @entity6			2
he was said to have specialised in providing medical aid to fighters and civilians injured during clashes with regime forces			0
he was eventually seized by the jihadists on 1 october , 2013 while delivering medical supplies to @entity63			0
leader : yesterday @entity116 - born journalist @entity115 - @entity114 made a direct plea to @entity12 leader @entity118 ( pictured ) to ' do the only right thing ' and stop his followers killing @entity4 jihadi @entity24 's promise to murder @entity4 if the @entity5 does n't end its airstrikes has illuminated deep divisions within the jihadist community over how the terror group should have dealt with the situation			1
numerous @entity12 sympathisers have claimed they would no longer support the terror group if they killed @entity4 - a man they consider to be a pious muslim			1
although radical clerics from around the world had pleaded for @entity134 @entity8 's life to be spared due to his aid work , the calls failed to pick up much support within the online jihadist community as he was not as @entity14 himself			0
yesterday @entity116 - born journalist @entity115 - @entity114 - who was born @entity138 but converted to @entity19 while a prisoner of the @entity140 in @entity141 - made a direct plea to @entity12 leader @entity118 to ' do the only right thing ' and stop his followers killing @entity4			1
citing a rule condemning the killing of converts , @entity143 said : ' people have suggested that @entity148 is not informed that some of his followers are planning to murder @entity150			0
' ' that must clearly be the case			0
having studied @entity19 extensively he for sure is aware of how enormous of a sin it would be to murder a brother who just converted to @entity19			0

@entity9 is a prominent member of @entity2 - affiliated @entity10
claims to have been treated by @entity4 while fighting @entity11 regime
said that he and other @entity10 leaders assumed @entity4 was a jihadist
he was ' surprised ' when an *islamic* state video identified him as a *hostage*
militant known as ' @entity24 ' threatened to behead @entity4 in @entity12 video
threat of beheading has sparked divisions among jihadists who say @entity4 has converted to @entity19 in captivity and therefore should not be killed
