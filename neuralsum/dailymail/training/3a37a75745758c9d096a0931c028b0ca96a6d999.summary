the case went to the @entity44 jury monday , two months after the start of the trial			0

@entity4 sat in the @entity51 courtroom expressionless as she listened to the verdict			0

but the judge in the case made extensive efforts to keep the @entity74 trial from becoming a sideshow like the one that enveloped the @entity79 case in the same courthouse exactly one year ago			0

@entity4 's past as a stripper , for instance , was barely mentioned during the trial			2
the case attracted nowhere near the attention of the @entity79 trial despite some similar circumstances			0
like in the @entity14 murder , @entity79 claimed self - defense , accusing her longtime on - again , off - again lover of being abusive , @entity94 reported			1

with their long dark hair and eyeglasses , the two women even look strangely alike			0
it has been reported that the 36 - year - old @entity4 befriended the 33 - year - old convicted killer while the two were in jail together			2

prosecutor @entity122 said at the start of the trail in february that mrs @entity4 needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole			2
but one of @entity4 's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of his client 's boyfriend , who was given an immunity agreement on child pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony			2
authorities said @entity4 fatally wounded @entity14 by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban @entity51 home in january 2009			2
disturbing : @entity4 is seen smiling while demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the hammer ( right ) entered her husband 's skull key witness : businessman @entity149 , who was @entity4 's boyfriend , testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $ 300,000 @entity14 , 34 , suffered multiple skull fractures and died a month after the attack			1
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against @entity4			1
@entity156 , one of @entity4 's attorneys , said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client 's boyfriend , businessman @entity149 , even after he failed to report to police that @entity4 had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire - iron beating			1
at first , @entity4 told investigators that @entity14 had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious			2
she told police that when she came to , she saw another man who lived at their @entity52 home beating @entity14 with a hammer			0
