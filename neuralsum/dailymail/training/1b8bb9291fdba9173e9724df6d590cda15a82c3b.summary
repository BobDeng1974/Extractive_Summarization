by @entity0 with the eyes of the world on @entity4 , there was mounting anger last night over cynical attempts by union leaders to bring chaos to our borders and transport networks			0
as thousands of athletes and officials pour into the country on the eve of the @entity16 , immigration and customs staff are tomorrow due to walk out at @entity19 – a move which the government could take court action to stop			1
and from friday , workers on @entity24 , some of whom have already secured @entity16 - linked bonuses of up to £ 1,000 , will start a work - to - rule regime			1
work - to - rule : @entity24 workers have been instructed to do no more than the minimum required in their contracts from friday @entity33 staff , taking visitors to @entity16 events in @entity36 , will also work - to - rule during the @entity37 similarly , staff on key suburban rail routes to @entity37 sites in @entity24 and @entity36 will also begin disruptive action			1
the moves come as a shocking new analysis reveals the number of working days lost to strikes is escalating dramatically			0
in 2011 , 1,388,000 days were casualties of industrial action – a three-fold increase on the 456,000 in 2009 , @entity49 ’s last full year in power			1
it was the highest figure since 1990 , when 1,903,000 days were lost			0
this morning , culture secretary @entity52 told @entity54 's today programme that he was ' very confident ' in contingency plans for thursday 's planned strike by border agency staff			1
' we need 550 people to maintain a full immigration desk policy at @entity19 which means we can get people through in the shortest possible time and we have 584 shifts now confirmed for thursday , despite the strike ' , he told interviewer @entity65			1
he said fears @entity19 would grind to a halt because of the extra passengers attending the @entity37 had so far failed to materialise , and he commended the situation at the hub airport as ' a tremendous success '			2
on the planned strike , he said : ' for an immigration officer - and i 'm sure the vast majority of immigration officers feel this way - thursday is one of the biggest days in their professional career			1
' it is the day when the eyes of the world will be upon them and the welcome we are giving to the rest of the world			0
" the vast majority of them will want to do a really good job and show what they are capable of			0
' last night conservative mp @entity93 said there was growing concern that public sector workers were being called out on the basis of tiny turnouts in strike votes			2
he said there was a clear case to require unions to secure the support of 50 per cent of balloted members to make industrial action legal			1
conservative mp @entity93 fears strikes are being called as a result of tiny ballot turnouts ministers are now considering taking court action over @entity113 leader @entity112 ’s decision to call a 24 - hour strike by @entity19 staff			1
seven out of eight of members of the @entity113 did not vote to take industrial action in a ballot of @entity121 staff			1
mr @entity52 told today that mr @entity112 ' must be losing confidence that what he 's doing represents the majority of his members ' after the union leader turned down the @entity128 's invitation to appear on this morning 's programme			1
the possibility of an injunction to block the strike came following a letter to the union from home secretary @entity135 , describing the planned walkout as ‘ opportunist and wholly unjustified ’			2
and cabinet office minister @entity138 has told colleagues other senior figures in the union movement had privately expressed dismay that the @entity113 was targeting the @entity16 transport rush			2
mr @entity93 said : ‘ @entity112 ’s vindictive action is the latest in a wave of reckless strikes , led by a few militants who want to sabotage the economy and humiliate the nation			0
‘ too often it is those union bosses shouting the loudest who have the least support from their own members			0
it is welcome that ministers are looking at reform			0
but , if the government is going to pick this fight , it must win it decisively			0
’ the strike action was also condemned by mr @entity52 , who said : ‘ any decision to strike during the @entity16 is highly regrettable			1
’ he insisted contingency plans were in place , but added : ‘ there will be slightly longer queues than in recent weeks			0
’ yesterday union leaders announced @entity24 employees are to stage a ‘ work - to - rule ’ from friday in an @entity16 - related dispute			1
the @entity172 union , which represents thousands of @entity24 staff , said it was in dispute over implementing an @entity16 pay deal as well as the use of casual workers			2
axed : @entity113 action that would have led to huge queues at airport immigration tomorrow has been cancelled the union has already secured @entity16 bonuses of up to £ 1,000 for drivers , with other members of staff in line for up to £ 850 for the ‘ massive additional pressures ’ they will face during the @entity37			1
the @entity172 ’s @entity33 members will refuse to do any overtime or work on a ‘ rest day ’ from friday until august 12			2
@entity33 operates many of the key train lines out of @entity24 ’s @entity192 , such as trains to @entity194 for the rowing , @entity36 for the sailing and @entity197 for the tennis			0
members of @entity200 's @entity172 , @entity201 and transport union will refuse to work on rest days during the @entity37 workers insist they are furious they are not getting a bonus for working during the @entity37			2
@entity33 , owned by @entity205 , dismissed this claim , insisting workers were given an inflation - busting pay rise of 4.75 per cent just a few months ago			0
@entity113 officials were due to hold talks with senior @entity121 officials last night over planned border strike			0
military police , @entity214 officials and retired border staff are on standby to prevent chaos at the borders if the strike goes ahead			0
the @entity113 said : ‘ the problem over the past 18 months has been that there has not been the political will in the @entity121 to reach a solution			0
’ @entity172 secretary @entity200 said : ‘ while the likes of @entity52 , and the rest of the government , are sitting in the well - padded vip seats in the @entity228 as a nice little bonus , our cleaners on the @entity24 and @entity232 , who work round the clock in appalling conditions , are being treated like dirt			2
’ @entity237 , @entity24 ’s chief operating officer , said : ‘ we reached agreement with all four unions at the end of may on how we can fairly reward our staff and operate services during the @entity243			0
the fact that four - fifths of those balloted chose not to vote or voted no to industrial action shows that we have the support of our staff			1
