by @entity0 @entity1 understands @entity2 's director of football @entity3 was in @entity5 on thursday to watch @entity8 centre half @entity6 in action			2
read the full story on the £ 20m - rated centre back here @entity2 want to buy @entity13 this summer as they struggle to keep hold of their homegrown stars			1
the club are identifying summer targets to satisfy @entity19 rules on homegrown players , with @entity23 full back @entity21 , @entity25 midfielder @entity24 and @entity27 defender @entity26 in their sights			1
@entity2 nominated nine homegrown players in their squad at the start of the season but face losing several of them this summer			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity34 on @entity24 's ability midfielder : @entity24 full - back : @entity21 defender : @entity26 wonderkid : @entity24 ( @entity40 ) has been earning rave reviews for @entity25 , including this goal against @entity43 @entity21 who 's talking : @entity23 defender @entity21 has also been linked with @entity44 and @entity45 best defence : @entity27 's @entity26 could be needed to replace departing homegrown players and , although the 2012 @entity19 champions are closing in on £ 20m - rated @entity5 centre back @entity6 , do n't expect too many more exports in the summer			1
@entity52 defender @entity51 will leave when his contract expires			2
likewise , @entity54 is not prepared to sign a new , five - year deal			0
@entity56 has struggled for games under @entity58 , yet the club are keen to keep him and @entity1 understands the right back has been offered an increase on his £ 80,000 - a - week deal to stay			2
feeling unwanted : @entity2 defender @entity51 ( r ) is expected to leave at the end of the season not about the money : @entity54 has been offered an increase to stay but wants more playing time what shall we do ? youngsters @entity73 and @entity75 are also considering their futures @entity19 clubs must include no more than 17 non-homegrown players over the age of 21 in their squads of 25			1
homegrown players are defined as players trained by their club , or another in the same country , for at least three years between 15 and 21			0
there is no obligation to put a certain number of them in a match - day @entity89 were the rules brought in ? there was concern that the richest clubs would stockpile the best players to the detriment of developing their own youngsters			0
the 25 - year - old ’s contract does not expire until the end of next season , but @entity2 may look to sell him in a cut - price deal this summer to avoid losing him for nothing in 2015			2
@entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 are monitoring the situation			0
@entity108 , who qualifies as homegrown even though he is @entity110 , has also been offered a new deal despite playing only one league game this season			0
however , the defender is understood to be hugely reluctant to re-sign given his lack of playing time and is also likely to leave			0
city chiefs will open talks with @entity119 — whose contract expires next season — before the @entity121 , but the @entity122 forward wants assurances over his playing time before agreeing to an extension			1
play me ! @entity119 wants assurances before he commits to a new contract at the @entity128 stunted growth : @entity73 has struggled to displace stars like @entity131 since moving from @entity25 pecking order : @entity133 may be tempted to move with the likes of @entity135 ahead of him the future of striker @entity133 , 22 , is also unclear given that his contract expires this summer , while @entity73 is known to be considering his future at the @entity128			1
midfielder @entity140 , on loan at @entity25 , will definitely be leaving while @entity142 defender @entity141 will be counted as an overseas player next season , having turned 21 last month			0
behind the scenes , the potential lack of homegrown talent is a concern and buying @entity13 is likely to be a necessity for @entity2			2
sporting director @entity3 is well aware of the problem and @entity2 ’s network of scouts are working hard to identify targets			0
one of ours : @entity141 will be considered a homegrown player next season having turned 21 last month sticking with @entity25 ? @entity140 is certain to leave after spending the season on loan with @entity25 warning signs ! @entity160 ( @entity40 ) was offloaded after barely featuring during his short spell at @entity2 however , persuading the likes of @entity21 , 18 , @entity24 , 20 , and @entity26 , 20 , that they can fulfil their footballing potential at @entity2 might prove a further stumbling block			1
you only need look at how some @entity2 buys have fared to understand why they might be cautious			0
@entity160 and @entity73 arrived from @entity168 and @entity25 respectively in 2012 but have struggled to make an impact			2
@entity160 has been shipped out on loan to @entity171 while @entity73 has found first - team football hard to come by , partly due to injury , and has made only seven @entity19 starts			1
@entity174 to head : @entity175 ( @entity40 ) and @entity58 could be competing for the same players next season old guard : @entity179 ( top ) , @entity181 and @entity182 ( r ) are some of @entity45 's hew homegrown stars @entity45 are also keeping abreast of the homegrown market			1
manager @entity175 could name only a 22 - man squad in september after reaching his full quota of 17 overseas players			0
at the time , @entity179 , @entity189 , @entity182 , @entity181 and @entity190 were the only homegrown players at his disposal — meaning he had to forego three squad places			0
@entity45 , like @entity2 , will be in the market for all the best @entity196 talent this summer , including @entity21 and @entity24			1
and that means only one thing : sky - high prices .			0

@entity2 are targetting young @entity196 players for next season
they have their sights on @entity21 , @entity24 and @entity26
city need @entity13 players to meet the @entity19 's homegrown rule
several existing stars , including @entity51 and @entity140 , will leave
@entity122 *international* @entity119 wants assurances to sign a new deal
@entity196 youngsters like @entity73 and @entity160 have *flopped*
prices will be high with @entity175 and @entity58 *chasing* the same players
