by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:44 pm on 14th november 2011 the @entity3 right - wing extremist who confessed to a bombing and shooting massacre that killed 77 people tried to give a speech describing him as a resistance leader at his first public court hearing today - but was cut off by the judge			1
wearing a dark suit , @entity13 was escorted by guards into an @entity17 court room packed with dozens of reporters and members of the public			2
they included survivors and families of his victims who were able to see him face - to - face for the first time since the bloody rampage			1
extremist : @entity3 mass murderer @entity13 is taken into an @entity17 court in a police van today for the first open hearing of his case @entity34 of a killer : @entity13 in military uniform ( left ) which he had requested to wear at a previous court hearing and ( right ) in an image found in a manifesto attributed to the anti-islam extremist earlier this year @entity13 began portraying himself as the ' commander ' of a @entity3 resistance movement and rejected the court 's authority to hear his case before the judge interrupted him and told him to stick to the issue at hand			1
speaking at a court just two blocks from where he detonated a huge homemade bomb , he said : ' i am a military commander in the @entity3 resistance movement and @entity55 @entity3			2
' regarding the competence ( of the court ) , i object to it because you received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideology ( and ) because it supports multiculturalism			1
' he acknowledged carrying out the massacre , but refused to plead guilty to terror charges			1
he claims he is in a state of war to protect @entity68 from being taken over by @entity70 immigrants			0
' i acknowledge the acts but i do not plead guilty , ' @entity13 told the court			2
@entity13 , speaking at a court picketed by a group of protesters holding a banner that read ' no speakers ' platform for fascists ' , attempted to address survivors and victims ' relatives , but the court denied his request			1
facing a killer : survivors of @entity13 's rampage wait nervously in the courthouse to see him for the first time since the attacks in july highly charged : armed police stand guard at the courthouse in anticipation of the hearing as media , survivors and protestors mingle outside media storm : journalists wait in line for a final security check in the @entity17 courthouse before today 's hearing speaking after the hearing , @entity104 , 20 , from @entity17 , said : ' he aimed at me on @entity107			1
that was the last time i saw him			0
' it is good to see he was powerless , which he was not then			0
he looked nervous and weakened			1
it was a different experience than when i saw him at @entity107			2
' most of the island victims were in their teens or 20s and some were shot at point - blank range or while trying to swim to safety			0
@entity122 , another survivor , said @entity13 looked weak and his rant showed he was mentally ill. ' i think that what he said there shows that he is completely mad			2
he is definitely not on this planet			0
' i did n't think he would look like that ... he was very big then and he now looked so flimsy , ' he said			1
in a rambling manifesto posted on the internet before the attacks , @entity13 wrote that his arrest would open ' the propaganda phase ' of his operation to ignite a war to defend @entity68 against a supposed @entity70 takeover			2
the world watches : members of the press wait in room 828 of the courthouse before @entity13 is led in for the hearing , but only after the photographers have left the hearing , required under @entity3 law to keep a suspect in prison before trial , was @entity13 's fourth , and as expected , the court decided to keep him in custody for a further 12 weeks			1
he will likely remain in prison until he goes to trial , probably in the first half of next year			0
about 120 people were admitted to the courtroom , while hundreds of others squeezed into overflow rooms equipped with video links			0
@entity13 has been kept in solitary confinement since july 22 and has been denied visits , correspondence and access to newspapers and television			0
the prosecution asked the court to ease those restrictions slightly on monday , but the judge declined			0
at the end of today 's hearing , however , the judge lifted a ban on reporting on the proceedings			0
investigators say @entity13 set off a fertilizer bomb outside the government headquarters on july 22 , killing eight people , before heading to an island retreat , where youth sections of @entity3 â€™s governing @entity179 were gathered for their annual summer camp			1
devastation : smoke billows from a 17 - storey government building after @entity13 's bomb rocked central @entity17 on july 22 killing eight people disturbing : police and rescue groups recover some of the last remaining bodies from @entity107 after @entity13 , posing as a police officer , shot dead 69 during a rampage at a youth camp disguised as a police officer , he opened fire on scores of panicked youth , shooting some of them as they fled into the lake			1
sixty - nine people were killed on @entity107 before @entity13 surrendered to a police @entity200			1
the carnage left @entity3 shocked and continues to haunt a nation that sees itself as peaceful and tolerant			0
an online manifesto attributed to @entity13 sheds light on his choice of targets			0
in it , he lays out a blueprint for a multi-phase revolution , targeting left - leaning political elites he accuses of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of immigrants , especially from @entity70 countries			0
his actions were widely condemned , including by the @entity218 bloggers and groups that he cited prolifically in the document			0
oil - producing @entity3 , home to the @entity222 , is known for its open society and relative prosperity , but the attacks sparked a public debate about immigration , security and a legal system which never had to cope with such an event .			2
