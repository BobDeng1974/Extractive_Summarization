commuters streaming into @entity1 today endured lengthy waits , crowded platforms and trains crammed full with disgruntled passengers - a week after @entity6 ravaged the country			1
the monday morning rush hour gave the recovering transit system its first stress test , revealing massive problems that still persist a week after public transport ground to a halt across the city			2
carriages were so crowded on the @entity16 that scores of people missed their trains , while queues for the ferry in @entity22 stretched to several hundred people by daybreak			1
nearly all subway lines are now running and service has been restored on key lines connecting @entity28 and @entity29 - yet officials warned travellers they could still experience problems			1
hectic : people wait at a crowded subway stop as the city tries to recover from the effects of @entity6 in @entity29 , @entity1			1
some of the city 's transit system is still not operating waiting : most of the subway lines are running , but trains are less frequent and slower other water - logged subway tunnels are still not ready for rush hour and that trains will be less frequent and slower than normal , officials said			1
the subway system , which carries 5.5 million riders daily , still suffers from damage to underwater tunnels , submerged tracks near the coastline and wrecked stations and equipment , they added			1
' service will not be normal tomorrow , and we need you to understand that before you enter the system , ' gov. @entity57 warned on sunday			2
workers called their employers from crowded platforms to ask to work from home , while others tried to figure out complicated routes to their offices			2
' there 's not much we can do , ' said @entity68 as he waited to board a ferry in @entity22 to his job as a security guard at @entity28 's september 11 memorial site			0
' we 'll get there whatever time we can , and our jobs have to understand			0
it 's better late than absent			0
' manic : people wait in a line to enter a crowded subway stop in @entity29 during the monday morning commute desperate : a man looks at the line to enter the crowded subway stop on monday morning patience : last week , commuters had been forced to take cars or buses , sparking gridlock across @entity28 squeeze : disgruntled commuters cram into subway trains as the public transit system attempts to recover on @entity93 , @entity92 told @entity94 she could not get off her train from @entity96 and @entity97 because ofthe overcrowded carriage , and ended up travelling past her stop			1
' i 've never taken the train before , ' she said			0
' there were people blocking the doorway so i got stuck on the train			0
' mayor @entity106 took the subway to work on monday and was joined by many of the students returning to class for the first time since @entity6 hit last monday			2
limited service is now available on the m line , which operates around @entity115 and @entity29 , and the f line , which connects @entity29 and lower @entity28			1
other train lines which also cross the @entity118 - the @entity119 , 2 , 3 , and @entity120 - are running			2
on saturday , trains on the 4 and 5 lines began running through pumped - out tunnels under the @entity118 into @entity29 , and the 7 line was running from @entity125 into @entity115			1
back in action : a new subway map shows how most services are running again after @entity6 flooded : @entity1 @entity130 workers used a special @entity131 to pump water out of the flooded @entity133 which carries the @entity135 trains between @entity29 and @entity28 this picture shows just how deep the flood water inside @entity138 is with most of the doors here fully submerged ticket machines in the station can be seen partially submerged here the 6 train , which runs from the @entity143 up @entity144 in @entity28 and into the @entity145 , is also back on line			1
others , including the @entity148 , @entity149 , a and @entity150 , are fully restored bar short sections at the end of each line			0
yet with tunnels still flooded in @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity29 , the @entity158 and @entity159 trains are likely to remain out of service on monday			1
@entity130 released photos on saturday showing workers draining two of the seven train tunnels beneath the @entity118 that were flooded in the aftermath of @entity6			0
on saturday , @entity130 chairman @entity166 said that five off the seven flooded tunnels under the @entity118 have been drained , but much work still remains to be done			0
the 14th @entity170 tube , which carries the l train into @entity156 , is still inundated ' from wall to wall and floor to ceiling '			0
not done yet : work continues around the @entity176 as vast amounts of water is pumped out of the @entity138 in @entity179 on friday closed : @entity138 station remains closed indefinitely as workers struggle to repair the damage left from @entity6 massive queues : because of limited service , @entity1 are forced to take shuttles ; here , lines form outside of @entity188 on november 2 the superstorm that has left 109 dead and plunged 60 million people into darkness , sent torrents of water into the @entity1 ’s massive subway system that serves 5.5 million riders daily , paralyzing mass transit for days			1
trains stopped running at 7pm sunday 28 as the @entity130 preemptively closed down service for only the second time in its history in an effort to secure the system , but that did little to prevent massive damage			1
all seven tunnels carrying trains between @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity115 were initially submerged , marking the worst ’s disaster in the subway ’s 108 - year history			2
the long , labor - intensive process of ridding the underground arteries off water requires hundreds of pumps , including ones powerful enough to empty an @entity214 - sized pool in less than 15 minutes , as well as help from the @entity217 ' special @entity216			0
workers pictured attempting to get the @entity1 subway system back on track this stretch looks more like a sewer system than a subway , with the track entirely submerged under floodwater maintenance workers can be seen making their way down the tunnel as they continue to pump floodwater from the subway workers eventually manage to drain this stretch the @entity234 ’s water - removal team consisting of more than a dozen experts has been using 12 eight - inch pumps and 13 six - inch pumps shipped from @entity238			2
once bigger pumps arrive , the @entity130 chairman said it wo n’t take much time to drain the tunnels			0
until then , the job is slow - going			0
each subway tunnel would require four pumps that could remove 1,000 - 1,500 gallons per minute , a 2011 @entity1 report estimated			0
at that rate , about 7.2 million gallons per day , per tunnel could be drained , although it remains unknown exactly how long it would take to drain all of the water .			0

commuters fought to squeeze on crowded trains during monday commute
full or limited service now on all subway lines apart from @entity158 and @entity159 lines
