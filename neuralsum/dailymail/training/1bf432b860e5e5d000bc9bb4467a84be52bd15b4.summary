texting with @entity0 is just as distracting and dangerous for drivers as using a smartphone			2
research has discovered that using the tech giant ’s hands - free headset makes motorist delay slamming on their brakes to avoid a collision			1
and this delay is similar to that caused when drivers use more traditional mobile devices			0
a study carried out by the @entity13 asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator			1
the participants were wearing using @entity0 ( pictured ) , or using smartphones			1
their reactions were recorded when a ‘ vehicle ’ ahead stalled however , the @entity0 wearers were able to recover control of their cars faster and more effectively afterwards			1
the study , carried out by the @entity13 , asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator either using @entity0 or smartphones			1
their reactions were recorded when a ‘ vehicle ’ ahead stalled			1
if you are sending a text , watching the tv or listening to the radio , you may want to stop and give this your full attention			0
multi-tasking shrinks the brain , research suggests			0
a study by the @entity36 found that men and women who frequently used several types of technology at the same time had less grey matter in a key part of the brain			0
the finding follows research which has linked multi-tasking with a shortened attention span , depression , anxiety and lower grades at school			0
the researchers compared text - messaging participants ’ reactions on each device to times when they were just driving without multitasking			1
psychologist @entity58 , of the @entity13 , said : ‘ texting with either a smartphone or @entity0 will cause distraction and should be avoided while driving			1
‘ @entity0 did help drivers in our study recover more quickly than those texting on a smartphone			2
we hope @entity0 points the way to technology that can help deliver information with minimal risk			0
’ the research is the first scientific study to look at using @entity0 to text while driving			2
distracted motorists are a renowned menace , with research in the @entity75 showing mobile phone use leads to at least 1.6 million crashes a year			0
with the emergence of @entity0 and competitors , several states are considering banning drivers from wearing those technologies			2
mr @entity58 added : ‘ as distractive influences threaten to become more common and numerous in drivers ’ lives , we find the limited benefits provided by @entity0 a hopeful sign of technological solutions to come			2
both activities caused motorists to delay slamming on their brakes , suggesting that the hands - free device was as distracting as texting			1
but glass wearers returned to driving normally more quickly than those who were using the phone at the wheel ( stock image pictured ) @entity0 gives drivers the option of using head movements and voice commands to view and respond to text messages , avoiding clumsy thumbs , texting with the technology still causes distraction			1
but , the researchers state it should not be used as a replacement for phones ‘ while glass using drivers demonstrated some areas of improved performance in recovering from the brake event , the device did not improve their response to the event itself			2
‘ more importantly , for every measure we recorded , messaging with either device negatively impacted driving performance			0
‘ compared to those just driving , multitaskers reacted more slowly , preserved less headway during the brake event , and subsequently adopted greater following distances			0
’ while @entity0 gives drivers the option of using head movements and voice commands to view and respond to text messages , avoiding clumsy thumbs , texting with the technology still causes distraction			0
he said the bottom line was not to trade a smartphone in for @entity0 in the belief it will make texting safer behind the wheel because it will not , at least for now .			0
