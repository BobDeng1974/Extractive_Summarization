by @entity1 reporter published : 08:39 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 21 november 2012 it was a classic @entity3 versus @entity5 confrontation			2
the odds were bleak for this tiny ant when it came across a mighty grasshopper on a plant in @entity11			1
but just as in the famous @entity14 tale , size was no barrier to victory as the smaller creature got the better of its almighty - relatively speaking - counterpart			1
the contrast in size is amazingly evident but this does n't seem to intimidate this ant as he goes and takes a chunk out of the grasshopper			1
the pictures were taken in @entity11 its head almost resembling a duck , the ant gives the mighty hopper a nip			1
the incredible images were taken using a @entity31 5 d despite the larger insect 's desperate kicks , the ant managed to bite the grasshopper and was then joined by eight of its ant friends who joined forces to subdue the green critter			0
photographer @entity39 took the pictures in a friend 's garden			1
he said : ' at first i thought the locust would be able to escape easily , but the strength of an ant is amazing despite having a small body			0
' ants also have a good togetherness and are very fast			0
when they attacked the locust was caught			0
' the @entity11 father of three has been a photographer since early 2011 and enjoys specialising in insects			1
he used a @entity31 5 @entity30 to capture the snaps , which took him roughly 30 minutes to shoot			0
despite its suffering , the ordeal finished with a happy ending for the locust as it eventually managed to fight its way out of the ants ' grasp			0
the grasshopper tries to escape the grip of the tiny ant by scuttling towards the top of the plant - to no avail			2
when that fails , it tries to go the other way but danger is lurking from the ant 's friends this time the grasshopper tries to escape by running down the plant - but the ant will just not let go			2

close - up pictures taken in @entity11 *prove* size is no barrier to victory
