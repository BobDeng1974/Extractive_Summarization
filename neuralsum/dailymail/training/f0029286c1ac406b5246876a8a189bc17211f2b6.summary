how ? mother @entity0 , 44 , questioned how her daughter and her boyfriend were allowed to leave @entity3 two teenage runaways who fled their top @entity3 public school to go on a @entity7 holiday were effectively expelled by the headmaster yesterday and told not to return			1
@entity9 , 17 , and @entity10 , 16 , will not be returning to the prestigious £ 30,000 - a - year @entity11 in @entity12 , after their parents travelled to the @entity14 to bring them home			1
@entity16 , headmaster of @entity11 , a @entity18 catholic school , is understood to have asked the parents to remove their children from the school with immediate effect			1
he said another @entity18 boarding school had offered the pupils an interview to give them ‘ a last chance to make a success of their sixth - form education ’			2
the decision came as @entity9 ’s mother @entity31 , 44 , blamed @entity3 – as well as young love – for her daughter ’s disappearance			1
speaking from the family mansion in @entity36 , @entity37 , she said : ‘ there are many shades in this story			0
for example , how did she manage to leave the country ? how did @entity3 let them go at their age ? why did this other country let them in ? ‘ i think it was both love and a strict school , ’ she added			1
‘ they ran away , then they got scared , they are children			0
thank @entity54 , they can go back to studying			0
they will get on with their education			0
‘ i only thank @entity54 she is alive and healthy			0
and i thank @entity54 she will be back at school			2
’ the young couple fled from the 400 - year - old @entity61 boarding school in @entity62 in the early hours of january 13 , after telling friends they wanted to escape from the rain			1
they took a taxi to @entity69 airport and boarded a plane to the @entity14 , where they were found , a week later , staying in an apartment in the resort of @entity74			2
@entity9 ’s father @entity75 and @entity10 ’s mother @entity76 flew out to be with them and they are all now staying in a five - star all - inclusive resort			1
the families are expected to fly back within the next few days			0
escapade : @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , are pictured at the five - star beach resort they fled to in @entity74 yesterday , mrs @entity84 declined to comment but mr @entity85 was pictured trying to reason with his daughter , who was clearly upset			1
a relative of @entity9 said that the girl feared having to return to conservative @entity37 after an internet backlash in her home country			2
the relative said : ‘ she told her father , “ how can i go back to school , and how can i live anywhere now ? i face shame and disgrace			2
i can not live calmly in @entity37 , everyone will point a finger at me ”			0
’ an official statement released yesterday by @entity11 said that @entity10 and @entity9 ’s parents withdrew their children from the school after long - distance phone discussions with the head about the repercussions of their children ’s behaviour			1
but @entity108 understands that decision was made after mr @entity16 made it clear to all parties that the pupils ’ continued position at @entity11 was untenable			2
@entity114 : one of the sandy beaches enjoyed by the runaways a school insider said : ‘ although they have not been formally expelled , the effect is exactly the same – they wo n’t be returning to @entity11			2
both pupils have been withdrawn at the headmaster ’s request			0
’ the @entity108 understands that @entity10 and @entity9 have been offered interviews at £ 25,000 - a - year boarding school @entity125 near @entity126			1
past pupils include @entity129 poet @entity128 and @entity130 , who wrote the @entity132 books			0
mr @entity16 said he helped to arrange the interviews after both pupils had given an account of their behaviour to their parents , and apologised			0
‘ i have spoken to the head there and as a result have secured interviews for both @entity10 and @entity9 at the school			1
it is now up to them to take it forward , ’ he said			0
‘ they have both said sorry for what they have done and for the distress they have caused and we would n’t want to leave them high and dry , no matter what they have done			0
they have been given a last chance			0
’ ' @entity155 ' : the students can not return to @entity11 in @entity12 mr @entity16 added : ‘ in a way , what has happened has been a lesson to others who might be contemplating the same thing			1
‘ pupils may have first thought that this was some kind of exciting adventure , but they soon saw all the trouble that @entity10 and @entity9 ’s actions have caused			1
‘ they also saw that sooner or later they had to face the consequences of their actions , which have led to @entity10 and @entity9 being unable to return to school			1
‘ all of a sudden it no longer looks like such a good idea			0
that in itself is a very powerful deterrent			0
’ a member of the @entity85 family said yesterday that @entity9 ’s wealthy father accepted that his daughter wanted to continue to study with @entity10			1
the relative said : ‘ he now wants to see her at this new school with @entity180 , and that both of them can do as well as possible so they can go on to good universities			0

@entity9 , 17 , and @entity10 , 16 , fled school for five - star holiday
now their places at @entity11 in @entity12 are ' untenable '
@entity9 *'s* mother , @entity31 , says ' love and a strict school ' are to blame
she also *slams* @entity3 and @entity14 border control for letting them go
