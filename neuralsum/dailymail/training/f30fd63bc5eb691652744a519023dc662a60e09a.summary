while there he began to document the reality of everyday life in the forces with an instamatic camera , capturing drug - fuelled parties , soldiers posing with page 3 girls and horseplay with rifles and equipment			2
those photographs form the basis of mr @entity14 ' new book , @entity44 - named after monthly parties which saw local girls invited into the barracks for a night of drinking , dancing and sex			1
horseplay : mr @entity14 said that - while the soldiers who took acid reserved it for when they were in camp - ' we still had rifles ' down - time : mr @entity14 spent five years in the army after joining as a 16 - year - old ' i just wanted to do something which is very truthful , ' said the writer , who admitted his book was ' not going to please everyone '			1
' it 's basically my own experience from how i saw it , ' said the author , whose stint in the army pre-dated the introduction of compulsory drug testing			0
mr @entity14 said many soldiers used recreational drugs as a means of finding respite from the rigours of military life			1
' i remember being on my two days off and being completely off my head , ' he said			0
' fortunately i managed to get my head straight			0
' @entity79 : the former soldier said many young servicemen were seeking an escape from the rigours of daily life in the military the author paints an eye - opening portrait of military life at the time , but says the drug taking he witnessed was largely reserved for soldiers ' down - time			2
' we used to have a rota , we 'd be on guard duty or escort duty , then go on a four week stint of @entity96 - the only thing we did there was smoke cigarettes , ' he said			2
' we were n't taking acid then			0
' the acid thing was when we were on camp - but we 'd still got rifles			2
' ' truthful ' : mr @entity14 was posted in @entity5 , as the @entity7 continued to rage , during his five year stint with the @entity3 recreational : the army was yet to introduce compulsory drug testing when @entity14 was a serving soldier mr @entity108 said that , having fallen in with ' a bad crowd ' in his home town of @entity111 , he joined the army with the aim of setting himself on the straight and narrow			1
' when i joined all my friends from school were going to the @entity118 and listening to the @entity119 and the @entity120 , i was very anti-drugs at the time			0
' but i realised a lot of soldiers were listening to the same thing - it was filtering through			0
' pressure : the former soldier said he suspects the type of drug use he describes in @entity44 still goes on among some servicemen today burgeoning scene : this photograph taken at an illegal rave at @entity132 in @entity133 features in @entity44 parties : the former soldier said he has ' no regrets ' about his five years in the army a paratrooper poses for the camera flanked by two page 3 models in @entity140 in 1992 before too long mr @entity14 was experimenting with hallucinogenics and burning incense in the barracks to hide the smell of marijuana			1
that the influence of the nascent rave scene and its drug culture had reached serving soldiers is evident from mr @entity14 ' photographs , which capture soldiers letting loose at illegal parties on @entity133 's @entity153			1
the army introduced compulsory drug testing in 1998			0
but asked whether he suspects some soldiers still seek an escape from the pressures of military life with the help of illegal substances , mr @entity14 replies : ' very much so			2

' drug misuse is significantly less prevalent among service personnel than in corresponding civilian demographic groups and we are clear that there is absolutely no place in the @entity173 for those who use illegal drugs			0
