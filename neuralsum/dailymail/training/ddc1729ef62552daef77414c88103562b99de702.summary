by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:37 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:48 est , 31 december 2013 cometh the @entity3 , cometh the rankings which lay the foundation for the first tranche of big fights in 2013			0
the principal corner - stone is the pound - for - pound rating of the best boxers in the world			1
rarely has a year turned around so many diverse opinions as to who are the ten finest of them all			0
the most intense argument centres upon @entity16 and his rightful place in that listing			2
still got it : @entity16 returned to winning ways with a comprehensive win over @entity22 the @entity23 were quickest to write off the @entity16 , who would also be president of the @entity25 , when his robbery by @entity27 was followed by his carelessness in getting knocked cold by @entity29			1
yet even in the @entity23 they admit , however reluctantly , that @entity16 remains the only authentic challenger to @entity31 as the master of his generation			1
@entity16 reminded them of that by overwhelming tough young gun @entity22 in his comeback			1
yet still @entity41 , the bible of boxing in @entity23 , and @entity44 , the gospel of the game in this country , relegate the @entity16 to the bottom half of their top ten			1
there is confusion , also , as to how best to acknowledge the talents of two other outstanding boxers			0
@entity54 ’s long reign as the multiple heavyweight champion has taken the edge off boxing ’s marquee division			0
@entity59 , arguably the most gifted amateur of all time , has turned pro late after leaving his native @entity61			2
thus he has continued in the classical style which he does best and has quickly become the dominant figure at super-bantamweight			0
even so he is criticised for failing to excite the crowds – and more importantly the tv moguls – by descending into brawls against technically inferior opponents			0
just as it is no fault of @entity54 ’s that they can find no - one to beat him , so @entity59 deserves admiration for his mastery of the noble art of self - defence			1
yet he is begrudged recognition for skills similar to those of @entity31 , who is everyone ’s no 1			1
@entity81 is also more esoteric than exciting but he , like mr @entity82 , is up there in all the rankings			0
but then he too is @entity23			0
skills : @entity59 is technically an excellent boxer - like heavyweight king @entity54 ( r ) untouchable : @entity31 cemented his position as the best in the world against @entity91 the lower ratings are complicated by the inactivity of the brilliant @entity94 because of injury and the ease with which @entity29 was outpointed by @entity27			1
and what do you do with @entity99 after his whipping by @entity31 ? in my view he is edged out by @entity103 , the @entity105 - @entity104 superman who has knocked out @entity106 , @entity107 , our own @entity108 and @entity110 – all four in the space of the calendar year just ending			1
boxing news deserve plaudits for doffing the cap of tenth place to the prize - ring ’s mini maestro			2
@entity119 , the world light - flyweight champion , has beaten all his 37 professional opponents , stopping 31 of them with a dynamite left , yet is still only 26			2
@entity124 basher : @entity103 knocked out @entity108 to retain his light - heavyweight world title 1 ) @entity127 ) @entity126 ) @entity128 ) @entity129 ) @entity130 ) @entity131 ) @entity132 ) @entity133 ) @entity134 ) @entity135 however , in common with @entity41 , i reserve that tenth position for @entity139 ’s only entrant in the pound - for - pound hierarchy			1
@entity135 - still love him or not after the controversy of his ninth round stoppage of @entity144 - remains the standard bearer for boxing in this country and a world champion who has taken on all the top super-middleweights on the planet			1
but what price @entity152 if he were to pull off the mother and father of all upsets against the imperial @entity31 ? for comparison , here are @entity41 and @entity44 rankings : ring : 1 ) @entity31 ; 2 @entity81 ; 3 ) @entity27 ; 4 ) @entity160 ; 5 ) @entity94 ; 6 ) @entity29 ; 7 ) @entity16 ; 8 } @entity161 ; 9 ) @entity91 ; 10 ) @entity135			1
@entity162 ; 2 ) @entity81 ; 3 ) @entity27 ; 4 ) @entity29 ; 5 ) @entity94 ; 6 ) @entity16 ; 7 ) @entity59 ; 8 ) @entity163 , 9 ) @entity160 ; 10 ) @entity119			1
* * next week – the @entity139 top ten			0
( both lists will then be updated at least monthly )			0
premature ? @entity135 stopped @entity144 in their world title fight despite the challenger 's protests there is much sympathy for @entity139 ’s @entity172 who , after all , will not be making his third bid for a version of the world middleweight title in @entity176 on february 1			0
yet in truth the time has come for the brake to be applied to the @entity181 ’s nonsense of elevating their champions to ‘ @entity184 ’ status , thereby allowing other contenders to dispute so - called ‘ regular ’ world titles			1
this has been a cynical device for the @entity181 to collect more sanctioning fees			2
it devalues the status of world champion , which is already diluted by the existence of so many alphabet bodies			0
chance gone : @entity172 ( right ) will not now challenge for the @entity181 world middleweight title in @entity197 after widespread criticism , not least from this quarter , the @entity181 have backed away from awarding such spurious celebrity promotion to @entity200 , whose fight on that bill in the south of @entity204 against @entity205 will now be a defence of his straightforward world title			1
@entity172 will still feature on the undercard , defending his ‘ interim ’ belt against @entity211 ’s lightly - rated @entity210			0
@entity172 does deserve another title shot , after pushing both @entity213 and @entity94 desperately close in his two previous challenges			0
but for the moment he finds himself back down a lengthening middleweight queue with , at its head , @entity200 the @entity220 knock - out merchant who stopped @entity172 ’s fellow @entity139 contender , @entity221 , in the old year			1
not so @entity184 : @entity200 will now defend his regular @entity181 middleweight title in february the boxing community will be deeply sensitive to the head injuries sustained by seven - time world champion racing driver @entity225			1
the hard old game drastically modernised its medical procedures after @entity228 suffered severe brain trauma at the climax of his world title fight with @entity232 in 1991			2
a failure to supply oxygen in the ring , as soon as he collapsed , became the focal point of @entity228 ’s subsequent claim for compensation			2
however , the speed with which @entity228 was transferred to hospital enabled renowned neuro - surgeon @entity242 to operate only 28 minutes after the event			2
catalyst for change : @entity228 suffered severe brain trauma after his fight with @entity232 in 1991 warning : boxing has since overhauled its medical procedures after @entity228 was not given oxygen immediatley that alerted boxing to what @entity242 labelled ‘ the golden hour			2
’ he stressed that surgery within those precious 60 minutes saved @entity228 ’s life and made possible his long , painful but eventually miraculous recovery from total blindness , paralysis and deafness , to the point where he was able to slowly complete a @entity260 marathon			1
worryingly , it took significantly longer than that before @entity225 underwent the procedure to remove blood clots and reduce the potentially fatal swelling and pressure of the brain within the confines of the skull			0
although a helicopter reached @entity225 on an @entity272 ski slope only eight minutes after he fell and crashed his head against a rock , it flew him initially to a small clinic nearby , he was conscious at first but reports that he was in an ‘ agitated state ’ suggest it may have been a mistake not to take him directly to the main hospital in @entity279			0
on the slopes : @entity225 - pictured in 2005 - is fighting for his life after hitting his head that did not happen until more than an hour - and - a - half after the accident , subsequent to him losing consciousness			2
further time must have elapsed as the surgeons there prepared to operate , even if they did not wait for the arrival of his personal specialist from @entity291			0
ironically , as @entity225 lies in an induced coma , only time will tell if those time lapses were critical			0
the wide world of sport , boxing very much included , will be praying they were not .			0

@entity31 remains peerless at the top of any pound - for - pound list
@entity16 has returned to no 2 after beating @entity22
@entity59 does not get the credit his skills deserve
the @entity181 were right not to promote @entity200 to ' @entity184 ' champion
did *doctors* miss the ' @entity309 ' with @entity225 that saved @entity228 ?
