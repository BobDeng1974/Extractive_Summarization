@entity2 will make it through to their first @entity1 final in 24 years if they beat @entity8 at the @entity9 in @entity10 on wednesday			1
@entity0 's trophy cabinet is packed with awards			2
he has won six @entity14 league titles with @entity15 , three champions @entity16 and he has been awarded the @entity18 on four occasions			1
four years ago , many of @entity0 's @entity15 team - mates returned to @entity37 with a @entity1 winners ' medals and now he wants one of his own			1
' as a player winning a @entity1 is the best there is , ' the @entity2 captain said in an adidas interview published on as			1
' it 's something you dream about when you are a kid and it never disappears			0
' i have asked my @entity15 team - mates @entity50 , ( @entity52 ) @entity51 and ( @entity54 ) @entity53 what it is like to lift the trophy , and they could n't explain			1
' we will do everything to make this dream a reality			0
' to play a @entity1 final with the great atmosphere of the @entity64 is something what every player dreams of , but first we have to make sure we get there			1
' danger man : @entity0 and @entity2 remain on course for a place in the @entity1 final going deep : @entity2 reached their first @entity1 semi-final since 1990 after beating @entity73 1 - 0 full flow : the magical attacker drives into the @entity73 half late in the second half of @entity2 's 1 - 0 win @entity2 will , of course , be banking on their talisman to deliver that bit of magic to beat @entity83 's @entity8 , who have been one of the toughest teams to beat at the @entity1			1
@entity2 coach @entity26 poetically summed up what @entity0 means to him after the narrow quarter - final win over @entity73			1
' he was our water in the desert , ' @entity26 said , reflecting on a first half in which @entity0 shone while others around him struggled			0
even though @entity26 has the likes of @entity93 , @entity94 and the fit - again @entity95 to call on , his reliance on @entity0 is clear			0
close watch : teams have tried to man - mark the @entity100 but he has still won games single - handedly architect : @entity0 has scored four of @entity2 's eight goals and provided a vital assist against @entity106 @entity107 : @entity2 highlights @entity0 , who has scored four of @entity2 's eight goals , could still end the tournament as top scorer , but he is not concerned about individual accolades			1
this is a team game , he insists			0
' i 'd prefer the @entity1 than the golden boot			1
always , ' he said			0
' i am only concentrating on the team			0
if we concentrate on our own game and we prepare ourselves tactically then our football will do the talking			0
' if i keep scoring goals and that helps the team then that is the most important thing			0
' if @entity0 was feeling any nerves on the eve of the semi-final in @entity10 then he was not showing it			2
' i am feeling positive pressure , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's a great honour to be captain of @entity2			2
i want to pay back the trust given in me leading @entity2 to the @entity1			1
' wait : @entity2 last lifted the @entity1 in 1986 when @entity132 guided them to glory in @entity134 laid back : the @entity15 forward is key to @entity2 's chances of lifting the @entity1 @entity2 and @entity8 share a rich @entity1 history			1
the @entity139 put on a fantastic display of ' total football ' to beat @entity2 4 - 0 in 1974 , but four years later the @entity142 got their revenge , beating the @entity8 to lift the trophy			1
twenty years on @entity145 scored a breath - taking winner in one of the most memorable matches of @entity149 ' 98			2
@entity150 : @entity2 have looked to @entity0 for inspiration at every turn during the tournament so far moment of brilliance : @entity94 can remember watching @entity145 's goal in the @entity157 @entity2 midfielder @entity94 remembers the @entity145 strike well			2
' i was at home watching it on television and i was just as disappointed as everyone else , ' @entity94 said			0
' this @entity139 team have got a lot of experience and they 're hungry for success after losing the final in 2010 , so we 'll have to be on our guard			2
we 're excited and we feel strong			0
we know we can put in another good performance			0
' @entity172 has been boosted by the return of @entity95 from a muscle injury for the semi-final			2
@entity93 may be out , but impressive full - back @entity176 returns from suspension .			0
