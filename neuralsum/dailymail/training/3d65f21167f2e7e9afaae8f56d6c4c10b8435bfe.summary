by @entity0 education secretary @entity1 today launches a consultation on new content for gcse and a-level exams teenagers should learn about the ‘ real world ’ in school including maths lessons in mortality and health statistics			1
under plans to toughen up qualifications , the government said children should write their own programs in computer science gcse and learn about the culture and ‘ sociological issues ’ of a country in language a-levels			1
the move is designed to help students better compete for apprenticeships , university places and jobs in the global labour market			2
the government is reforming a-levels following concerns from academics that current qualifications are not adequately preparing students for degree level courses			1
gcses are also being revamped to make them more rigorous than previous specifications , placing them on a par with education systems across the world			2
education secretary @entity42 will today launch consultations on new content for a and as - levels in maths , further maths , geography , ancient languages , modern foreign languages , @entity51 , music and dance			1
there is a new emphasis on problem solving in maths a-levels			2
for the first time , students must interpret at least one real , large data set for example mortality and health statistics for countries across the world			1
in geography a-level , there will be a ‘ better balance between physical and human geography ’ and a focus on fieldwork			0
students will be required to study global systems and governance , landscape systems as well as water and carbon cycling			0
this follows feedback from universities that students often arrive without any ‘ substantive ’ experience of independent research and fieldwork			0
in modern foreign language a-levels , sixth - formers will be expected to ‘ use language spontaneously ’ in discussions			1
they must learn about the ‘ literature , culture and sociological issues in the countries where the language of study is spoken ’ , according to the @entity96			1
there was no requirement to learn about the society of a country under the previous specification			0
in @entity51 , students will have to demonstrate their ability to use modelling and data analysis to evaluate physical activity			0
the move , which will see students learn about the ' real world ' in their subjects , is designed to help students better compete for apprenticeships , university places and jobs in general ( stock pic ) academics have complained that current a-level pe students have little experience of critical thinking , data analysis or research			1
mr @entity42 will also today publish proposed new content for gcses in art and design , dance , computer science , music and @entity51			1
computer science @entity123 will require teenagers to analyse and solve problems , write and refine programmes and understand key mathematical principles			1
they must also learn about data representation and boolean logic , a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either ‘ true ’ or ‘ false ’			0
these minimum requirements were developed with advice from organisations including the @entity142 , e-skills @entity143 , @entity144 and the @entity145			0
@entity146 will also become more demanding , with teenagers facing new minimum requirements for the length of time they must spend performing and composing			0
@entity51 has more ‘ theoretical and scientific content ’ , requiring students to understand how anatomy and physiology , psychology and socio - cultural influences impact performance			0
@entity158 students must understand the context of choreography and performance and pupils will have to better grasp the use of colour , line , tone and texture in art and design gcses			0
all the subjects being consulted on will be taught in schools from 2016			0
@entity172 , chief executive of maths in education and industry , welcomed the greater stress on problem solving and modelling in maths a-levels			2
he said : ‘ this , along with the innovative approach to statistics involving the use of technology to analyse large sets of real data , can deepen students ’ understanding of mathematics and how it is used			2
’ the @entity190 , a group of organisations working across the arts , cultural and educational sectors , said new content for arts subjects would help pupils develop critical thinking and ‘ hone technical skills ’			0
' coupled with real world , fit for purpose assessment it will provide a new foundation for developing demanding and inspiring gcses and a-levels that meet pupil and employer needs , ’ a spokesman said			1
a @entity96 spokesman added : ‘ these rigorous new exams will equip our children with the best skills and education so they can fulfil their ambitions and succeed in a global workforce			2
