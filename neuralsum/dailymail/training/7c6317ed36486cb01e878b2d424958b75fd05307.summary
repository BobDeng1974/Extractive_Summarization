this means anyone on the social network will be able to see the posts , click through to the young user 's profile and see any other publicly shared information			2
by adding this option to users aged between 13 and 17 it also means they can let strangers ' follow ' their public posts			1

' so , starting today , people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on @entity6			1
@entity6 previously set the default privacy for posts made by these younger users as ' @entity23 ' yet ' going forward , when people aged 13 through 17 sign up for an account on @entity6 , the initial audience of their first post will be set to a narrower audience of ' friends			1
' the blog continues : ' in addition , teens will be able to turn on follow so that their public posts can be seen in people 's @entity84			2
as always , followers can only see posts they are in the audience for			0
