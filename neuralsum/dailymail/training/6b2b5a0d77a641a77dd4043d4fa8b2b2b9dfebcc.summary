using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head , @entity12 can detect the movement of multiple objects , assessing distance and direction @entity12 can predict the direction a person will walk and instantly take an alternate path to avoid a collision the latest advancements take @entity4 a step closer to creating a robot for practical use in the home or workplace			1
pictured is @entity12 taking people through its development history @entity4 said @entity12 is still in development and there are no plans to commercialise the robot the latest advancements takes @entity4 a step closer to creating a robot for practical use in the home or workplace			1
