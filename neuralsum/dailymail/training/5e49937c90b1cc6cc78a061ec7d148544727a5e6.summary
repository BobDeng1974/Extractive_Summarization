a miracle cat survived a terrifying motorway journey after it became wedged inside the engine bay of a parked car			1
the black cat , who has now been nicknamed @entity6 , crawled inside the engine of @entity9 's blue @entity8 while it was parked at @entity10 for the day			1
several hours later , when ms @entity9 , who works at the airport , returned to the car , lucky the cat was unable to extricate himself from his resting place and was carried for a 30 - mile motorway journey at speeds of up to 60 miles - per - hour			1
lucky the cat , left , climbed aboard @entity9 's blue @entity8 while it was parked at @entity10 the cat worked its way into the warm engine bay of the car while it was parked at @entity10 as ms @entity9 approached her home in @entity25 she could smell burning and when she opened up her bonnet she could hear @entity6 the cat , top , meowing desperately for help ms @entity9 was travelling home at the end of the day when she noticed a burning smell as she struggled to get the car into gear			1
but when she pulled over and peered into the bonnet with her torch , she was amazed to hear a cat meowing for help			2
ms @entity9 said : ' the car had been parked up all day so i have no idea when the cat crawled in there , i certainly did n't see him before i got in			1
' i noticed a smell of fire coming from the bonnet and when i stopped i got a torch and looked under my bonnet - that was when i heard the meowing			2
i 'd been driving on the motorway so i think it 's amazing @entity6 is still alive			2
' the @entity55 in @entity10 is currently looking to reunite @entity6 with his owner she called the @entity59 as soon as she spotted @entity6 trapped near the engine , and inspector @entity61 was sent to the rescue			1
but @entity6 had become so wedged in place that mr @entity61 could not coax him out			0
he decided the only way to rescue the moggy was to dismantle the car			0
after calling various breakdown companies , mr @entity61 was finally forced to call the fire brigade , who were able to release @entity6			0
mr @entity61 said : ' he was literally wedged in right at the back of the engine , and we were hoping that if we lifted the car we could just pull him out , but there was n't enough room around the engine to grab him			0
' @entity79 fire team from @entity25 came out and it took about two hours to eventually set him free			0
' i 've since found out that @entity6 did have some burns on his left hip which were operated on			0
' @entity6 is now being cared for at the @entity85 @entity84 , who are looking to reunite him with his owners			0
