by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has denied spitting at @entity4 in the @entity6 derby but the @entity7 are investigating the incident			1
the @entity10 midfielder was fortunate to only receive a yellow card for thrusting his forearm into @entity4 ’s face but new footage appears to show @entity2 spitting at the @entity16 defender on the ground			1
the @entity7 have asked to see clearer images			2
@entity10 boss @entity19 said : ‘ @entity2 is adamant that he did n’t do that			0
we ’ll work with the @entity7 if that ’s what we have to do to clear it			0
’ footage : video has emerged that appears to show @entity2 spit towards @entity4 aftermath : the incident happened moments after @entity2 elbowed the @entity31 defender insult to injury : @entity4 was on the ground hurt walking away : @entity2 then walks away after being booked by @entity34 getting away with it : @entity2 was only booked for elbowing the @entity16 defender accident ? @entity2 has since claimed that @entity4 ran into his elbow banned : @entity16 's @entity38 was retrospectively banned after spitting at @entity16 goalkeeper @entity39 the @entity10 midfielder was booked by referee @entity34 for a first - half elbow in the face of his @entity16 opponent			1
however , with @entity4 stricken on the turf , @entity2 appears to spit at the @entity31 immediately after being shown the yellow card			1
the £ 28million summer signing was unrepentant about the elbow on the defender			0
' i do n't know , but i certainly did n't do it on purpose , ' said @entity2 when asked about the incident that saw him pick up a just yellow card			2
' i put my arm up to try and protect possession of the ball , and @entity4 bounced ( his jaw ) against it			0
he was unlucky to make contact			0
' the movement by me was not in an aggressive manner			0
it was a defensive move to protect the ball			0
' making a case : @entity34 opted to show @entity2 the yellow card rather than the red too easy : @entity16 barely moved out of second gear as they smashed @entity10 3 - 0 at @entity68 @entity69 , set and match : @entity71 bags his second goal of the night in a dismal showing for @entity10 the @entity7 could now look into the incident in much the same way as they did when retrospective punishment was served on @entity16 's @entity38 earlier this month			1
television cameras caught the forward spitting towards goalkeeper @entity39 during @entity81 's 2 - 0 win at the @entity82			1
@entity38 was subsequently banned for three matches despite appealing against the charge and protesting his innocence .			2

the @entity7 are looking into footage that appears to show @entity2 spitting towards @entity4 during the @entity88
incident happened as the @entity16 defender lay on the *floor* after @entity2 had elbowed him during the first half of the 3 - 0 defeat
*governing* body will *request* more footage of the incident before determining a course of action - there will be no *update* before next week
retrospective action could be handed out in the same way that saw @entity16 's @entity38 banned for three matches for spitting at @entity39
@entity2 denies *allegation* he spat on @entity31 right back
