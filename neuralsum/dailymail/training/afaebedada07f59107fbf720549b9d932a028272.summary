by @entity0 how did the mountain known as @entity2 come to be in the centre of the @entity4 on @entity5 , and just how habitable was this area in the past ? that 's what the team operating @entity11 's @entity10 will be hoping to discover after spending the weekend inspecting a potential drilling site			1
the site contains a sandstone slab known as @entity16 , named after a gorge in @entity18 , that could provide much - needed answers to some intriguing questions about life on @entity5			1
this image , taken at the end of last week with the @entity10 's @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , shows a sandstone slab at the centre			1
the rover team has spent the weekend getting @entity10 to examine a target patch on the rock , called ' @entity16 , ' with a view to studying it further if this target meets criteria set by engineers and scientists , it could become the mission 's third drilled rock - and the first to be carried out on sandstone , rather than mudstone			1
from planned drilling at @entity43 , @entity10 's science team hopes to analyse the cement that holds together the sand - size grains in the rock - and learn more about the habitability of the region			1
the planned inspection , designed to aid a decision on whether to drill at @entity43 , includes observations with the camera and x-ray spectrometer at the end of the rover 's arm			0
a brush to remove dust from a patch on the rock was also used , and readings of composition at various points on the rock were made using an instrument that fires laser shots from the rover 's mast			0
the spectrometer on the rover 's robotic arm is the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , which was provided by the @entity73			0
the camera on the arm is the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) , built and operated by @entity77 , @entity78			0
the laser on the mast is part of the @entity83 instrument ( @entity84 ) , from the @entity85 @entity87 's @entity86 in @entity88 and the @entity90 national space agency , @entity89			0
the rover 's wire - bristle brush , the @entity93 , was built by @entity94 , @entity95			0
@entity10 's hammering drill collects powdered sample material from the interior of a rock , and then the rover prepares and delivers portions of the sample to onboard lab instruments			1
the first two @entity5 rocks drilled and analysed this way were mudstone slabs neighbouring each other in @entity108 , about 2.5 miles ( 4 kilometres ) northeast of the rover 's current location at a waypoint called ‘ the @entity112			2
’ those two rocks yielded evidence of an ancient lakebed environment with key chemical elements , and a chemical energy source that provided conditions billions of years ago favourable for microbial life			0
it is hoped @entity16 could provide similar information into the previous habitability of @entity5			1
‘ we want to learn more about the wet process that turned sand deposits into sandstone here , ’ said @entity124 scientist @entity123 , of the @entity125 in @entity126			0
‘ what was the composition of the fluids that bound the grains together ? that aqueous chemistry is part of the habitability story we 're investigating			0
’ the target is on the approximately two - foot - wide ( 60 centimetres ) rock seen in the right half of this view			0
the sandstone target 's informal name comes from @entity143 in @entity18			2
if this target meets criteria set by scientists , it could become the mission 's third drilled rock and the first that is not mudstone this view is an excerpt from an 11 april 2014 observation by @entity11 's @entity155			1
in the lower centre of the screen , by the red dot , is ' @entity159 ' that stands 16 ft ( 5m ) high , with @entity16 nearby			2
curiosity appears as the bright blue object at the two - o'clock position relative to the dot understanding why some sandstones in the area are harder than others also could help explain major shapes of the landscape where @entity10 is working inside @entity4			1
erosion - resistant sandstone forms a capping layer of mesas - hills shaped like table - tops - and buttes - isolated hills with steep sides and flat tops			0
it could even hold hints about why @entity4 has a large layered mountain , @entity2 , at its centre			2
@entity11 ’s @entity181 ( @entity181 ) project is using @entity10 to assess ancient habitable environments and major changes in @entity5 environmental conditions			1
over the weekend @entity10 extended its arm to @entity16 to ascertain whether it is worthwhile drilling there			1
the rock is within a waypoint location called ' the @entity112 , ' where sandstone outcrops with differing resistance to wind erosion result in a stair - step pattern of layers the team must now decide if the rock , pictured , is worthy of further study			2
drilling operations can take weeks to plan and execute , which is why so much preparation is needed			0
ultimately this seemingly inconspicuous sandstone could explain how @entity2 , @entity10 's ultimate destination , formed in the @entity4 the @entity10 , pictured , landed on @entity5 on 6 august 2012 and has been exploring its fascinating surroundings ever since			1
@entity11 's @entity205 , a division of @entity125 , built the rover and manages the project for @entity11 's @entity208 in @entity209			2

curiosity has spent the weekend inspecting a sandstone slab on @entity5
the team at @entity11 must now decide whether the site is worthy of drilling
it would be @entity10 's third drilling mission and first that is *n't* in mudstone
the site is known as @entity16 and is near @entity159
it could provide information as to how @entity2 in @entity4 formed
