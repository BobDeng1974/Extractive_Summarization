by @entity0 @entity2 police have released two never - before - seen images taken at the scene of @entity6 's death after they announced they were re-examining evidence in the two decade - old case			1
one of the tragic photographs , which comes from four rolls of undeveloped film stumbled upon last month , shows a small cigar box containing a spoon , possibly with heroin residue on it , needles and a lighter laying on the floor next to a cigarette butt and a pair of dark sunglasses			2
the second picture shows the box closed , next to cash , a woolly hat and an open wallet that appears to display @entity6 's @entity28			2
the rolls of film were found in sealed bags by an officer who was going through @entity6 's case file ahead of the approaching 20th anniversary of the singer 's death			1
the images are said to detail the scene in sharper detail than the @entity62 pictures used in the original 1994 investigation causing police to review all evidence			2
however , authorities have stopped short of declaring a full re-opening of the case and police are reluctant to suggest much will come from the new photos			2
new evidence : police in @entity2 have announced that new photographs of the scene of @entity6 's suicide have been uncovered and developed scene : a police officer stands guard on the back porch of @entity6 's garage where @entity6 's body was found early 08 april 1994 in @entity2 , @entity81 , after an apparently self - inflicted gunshot wound the nevermind star was discovered dead of an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound in his home near @entity86 by electrician @entity87 , who raised the alarm			1
the @entity2 chief medical examiner ruled that @entity6 , who was 27 at the time , had ended his own life three days earlier after leaving a rehab facility for heroin addiction			1
authorities recovered a note , but speculation has been rife since that the @entity98 singer did not commit suicide			2
indeed , the 1998 documentary @entity100 by filmmaker @entity102 infamously made allusions to @entity6 's widow , @entity104			2
close up : the spoon appears to show leftover white power better detail : the police say the images are clearer than @entity110 used in the original investigation identification : one picture shows an open wallet containing what appears to be @entity6 's @entity28 no evidence has ever been found that the @entity118 singer was in any way responsible for the rock icon 's death			1
authorities initially ruled @entity6 's death a suicide and said he had taken a lethal dose of heroin prior to shooting himself			1
since his band rocketed to fame in the early 1990s , @entity6 had struggled to deal with the public perceptions of him and suffered depression and battled addiction			0
according to local @entity2 station @entity133 , authorities developed four rolls of 35mm film found last month by the @entity138 photo lab under high security			1
detective @entity43 , a spokesperson for the @entity32 , told the @entity140 the pictures have a slight green tint because of deterioration but still reveal more than the original polaroids			0
@entity133 reported that the image of @entity6 's dead body will never be released			1
as @entity49 fans across the globe went wild with speculation that police were to officially reopen the investigation into his death , @entity2 police were quick to clarify the pictures and the status of the case			1
' despite an erroneous news report , we have not ' reopened ' the investigation into the suicide of @entity6 , ' the @entity32 tweeted from a verified account			2
the police went on to explain on @entity163 that the case was simply being reviewed in anticipation of the 20th anniversary of @entity6 's untimely death			1
almost 20 years to the day speculation still rages amongst @entity49 fans as to the circumstances surrounding @entity6 's death			1
his death certificate stated that he died as a result of a ' contact perforating shotgun wound to the head ' , and concluded it a suicide			0
however here are the leading theories that have grown up around his death homicide : lack of blood at the scene : @entity2 public access host @entity184 obtained a video taped from outside @entity6 's garage looking into his house			1
the scene around the body showed what @entity184 claimed was a distinct lack of blood for a point - blank shotgun blast to the head			0
toxicology report : the official pathology report determined that the level of heroin in @entity6 's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter - a potentially lethal dose			1
@entity201 : this 1993 file photo shows lead singer of @entity49 @entity6 who was just 27 when he died however , private investigator @entity204 - who worked for @entity104 - has pointed out that meant @entity6 could have been too high to even be able to pull the trigger			1
furthermore , @entity204 argues that the heroin was used to incapacitate @entity6 before the shotgun was fired by the perpetrator of the homicide			0
suicide note : @entity204 claims that while he was working for @entity104 he came across the suicide note that @entity6 wrote for @entity104			0
he believes that the letter reads as a note announcing he is leaving his wife and the music business - not as a farewell to life			0
he claims the final few lines at the bottom - which do imply suicide - were added afterwards by an unknown individual			0
the shotgun : the gun that the singer used to kill himself , a @entity227 11 20 gauge , was not checked for fingerprints until may 6 , 1994			0
according to the @entity231 , four cards of latent prints were lifted but contained no legible prints			0
@entity102 : the filmmaker 's controversial film , @entity235 and @entity104 made the claim that @entity104 paid for a hit on her husband 's life			0
however , in a 1998 interview , @entity102 said , ' i think that he committed suicide			0
i do n't think that there 's a smoking gun			0
' suicide : many of @entity6 's friends and family have noted the singer 's private and public utterances of depression and instability			1
they noted his struggles with addiction and what they believe was an undiagnosed bipolar disorder			0
they point to a previous suicide attempt in @entity261 in and bandmate 's @entity262 and @entity263 all believe he sadly took his own life			0
suicide note : @entity6 did leave a suicide note , pictured , at the scene			2
this picture of the note was released years ago ' our detective reviewed the case file anticipating questions surrounding the closed @entity6 case as the 20 yr anniversary approaches , ' another tweet explained			2
detective @entity43 later told @entity279 : ' there was nothing earth - shattering in any of these images			0
' speaking to @entity133 on april 8 , 1994 , electrician @entity87 said that as he walked into the @entity49 legend 's home ' i noticed something on the floor and i thought it was a mannequin			1
' so i looked a little closer and geez , that 's a person			0
i looked a little closer and i could see blood and an ear and a weapon laying on his chest			0
' stunned , he said that he could recall seeing the suspected suicide note ontop of soil in the home 's greenhouse			0
' i only read the bottom lines , ' he said ' the bottom two lines said , ' i love you , i love you ' to someone			0
' conspiracy theories : @entity6 of and wife @entity104 holding daughter @entity306 - @entity49 fans have often tried to implicate @entity104 in her husbands death - all these theories have been refuted by authorities legends : this 1991 file photo shows the band @entity49 , from left , @entity262 , @entity263 , and @entity6			1
@entity49 will be inducted into the 2014 @entity314 on april 10 , 2014 , at the @entity315 in @entity316 two weeks before his suicide , a police report detailed how officers had been called to his @entity2 home after @entity6 had locked himself in his bathroom and threatened to kill himself			1
the report said that at the time , police were told ' he had a gun in the room			0
' however , @entity6 had told police he was not suicidal , but in the aftermath of his death they immediately ruled suicide			1
more than 7,000 mourners packed @entity330 two days later for a public memorial , where a recording was played of @entity333 reading @entity6 's suicide note			1
last year , a @entity2 police department spokeswoman said the department gets at least one request per week to reopen the investigation , mostly through @entity163			2
police have said no other @entity2 police case has received similar attention over two decades , reports @entity133			1
for confidential help , call the @entity343 at 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 or visit @entity344 / for confidential support on suicide matters call the @entity347 on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local @entity347 branch or visit @entity349 /			0
