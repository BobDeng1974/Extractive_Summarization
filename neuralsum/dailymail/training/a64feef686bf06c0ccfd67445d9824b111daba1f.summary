an @entity2 - infected @entity1 terrorist could easily motorboat across @entity3 and reach @entity4 from @entity5 , according to an @entity7 conservative filmmaker who videotaped a fictionalized one - jihadi incursion across @entity3 and released the footage monday			1
' on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary our man , dressed as an @entity1 terrorist was able to cross @entity16 , walk off a boat into @entity18 , @entity4 – and into the @entity19 , ' guerrilla documentarian @entity10 narrates			1
' at no point did anyone even question [ him ] or ask him what he was carrying in his suspicious brown duffel bag			2
his video shows a black - clad jihadi with a @entity55 accent being ferried across @entity3 , which separates @entity4 from the @entity5 province of @entity57			1
' the @entity55 government says @entity7 journalist @entity60 's @entity1 assassin was an @entity61 , ' @entity10 says in his narration			1
' @entity55 intelligence believes more than 500 @entity55 citizens have joined @entity1			0
brits can enter @entity5 without a visa ; it 's virtually an open door			2
' in the short gonzo documentary , @entity10 meets up with a ' terrorist ' who has hired a boat to bring him from @entity57 to the middle of @entity3			0
the two exchange pleasantries as the pretend jihadi transfers to @entity10 's @entity7 - piloted craft			2
' on august 17 we stole @entity2 from a lab in @entity77 , ' he says in the script			0
' we took he bandages and the bedsheets and then we covered ourselves in it and hoped that we 'd get infected			0
' the incubation period is about 21 days , and it 's been about – 21 days			0
' @entity10 , a confirmed rabble - rousing video activist , last made national noise in august with a video showing how an @entity86 terrorist – dressed as @entity87 , no less – could wade across the @entity88 from @entity89 to the @entity7 without being detected			1
' we went to @entity90 and saw little border security , ' he told @entity92 on monday ; ' now we ’ve discovered there ’s even less border security on the @entity5 border			1
' charter caption @entity96 told @entity10 that he has never seen @entity30 actually patrolling the lake known in @entity18 as ' @entity36 's @entity99 ' in the film , a dressed - up @entity86 militant character points to the freshwater supply intake that he plans to use as a ricin delivery vehicle his jihadi character in this latest video also carries with him a container marked ' ricin			1
' playing the part to the hilt , the actor points to a fresh - water intake port that serves the @entity18 , @entity4 metropolitan area , and tells @entity10 , ' the water supply is over there			0
if we put it in there , it will kill a lot of @entity7			0
' staring into the camera , @entity10 clarifies that the terrorist , his ricin and his @entity2 - soaked linens are make - believe – but warns that ' anyone can cross this border			2
you could cross in a @entity127 if you wanted to			0
' ' you could import weapons , you could import whatever you wanted to , because there 's no detection on our borders			0
' @entity10 told @entity92 that ' the only coast guard vessels we saw were tied up at their docks			1
' ' one of the boat captains expressed his own concern about border security , ' he said , ' and worried that perhaps the @entity35 are the soft underbelly of @entity36			0
' according to federal law , boaters who cross from @entity5 to the @entity7 must notify the @entity144 , but it 's an open question whether they do -- or even know about the requirement @entity10 last made headlines by donning an @entity87 @entity150 mask and army fatigues to show how easy it would be for a terrorist to sneak into @entity90 by wading across the @entity88 from @entity89			1

conservative filmmaker 's latest provocation shows *lax* security on @entity36 's *northern* border
@entity10 filmed a play - acting black - clad jihadi with a @entity55 accent carrying fake ricin and pretend @entity2 across @entity3 and into @entity18
he managed to *disembark* , walk to the @entity19 carrying a duffel bag , and enter the building without anyone challenging him
@entity55 citizens can enter @entity5 without a visa ; @entity60 's *executioner* was believed to be a @entity170
' the only coast guard vessels we saw were tied up at their docks , ' @entity10 told @entity92 ; one boat captain said he has never seen @entity30 on the waters
the right - wing documentarian 's latest work follows an august video that showed ' @entity87 ' sneaking into @entity90 from @entity89
