but for the last 146 years , the small village has been used as a colony for leprosy patients , many of whom were torn from their families and banished to the idyllic peninsula for quarantine			1
@entity2 , the world 's first leper colony , had a population of 1,200 patients at its height and has treated more than 8,000 sufferers since it opened in 1866			1
they have chosen to speak out to coincide with the impending canonization later this month of mother @entity43 , one of the many @entity35 nuns who have ministered the settlement			2
they told of burying spouses , having babies taken away and being treated like they were a ' monkey show '			1
but despite the painful memories , most are still desperate to preserve their way of life			2
' i 've heard people say it would be a nice resort , ' 81 - year - old @entity57 told www.syracuse.com			2
' i do n't want them to do that to @entity2			1
i do n't want it to change			0
' doing @entity64 's work : this is @entity66 , where @entity29 ministered for his 16 years on @entity2 before his death in 1889 from leprosy trouble in paradise : a view through the back of @entity72 on the leper colony of @entity2 , @entity4 , where more than 8,000 sufferers were banished since it opened in 1866 visiting room : named the @entity77 because of its shape , it was built in 1933 as a place for relatives and friends to visit patients , sitting on opposite sides of the table leprosy , also known as @entity87 's disease after physician @entity87 , is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria @entity89 and @entity91			1
left untreated , the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin , nerves , limbs and eyes			0
a common myth is that body parts can fall off , but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections			0
although the form of transmission remains uncertain , it is thought to be through respiratory droplets			0
the @entity106 estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy			2
in the past 20 years , 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide			2
@entity110 , now 77 , went to @entity111 , a peninsula on the island of @entity33 , when he was 12			0
he lost the use of his hands and feet and became blind at 30 , but says his time at the colony was ' fabulous '			0
mr @entity110 , who now lives at a state - run extension of @entity2 due to his poor health , said : ' we could go hiking and hunting in valleys and swim anytime			1
' we went spear - fishing			0
we were just stranded there , and yet i loved it , ' he told www.syracuse.com			0
some , like @entity129 , however , say they felt ' dirty ' and regarded the village like a prison			0
the colony opened a year after @entity4 's @entity134 brought in the @entity135 to prevent the spread of @entity85 to enforce the exile of sufferers			1
by 1873 , when @entity29 , the only other @entity35 from the island to be made a saint , began working on @entity2 , about 600 patients had been shipped there			1
the population later reached a high of 1,200 in 1890 after @entity145 was overseeing her ministry			0
but since the introduction of new medication in the 1940s , few patients were sent there and the quarantine was eventually lifted in 1969			1
patients were free to leave , but many did n't want to			2
' i had a lot of sadness , but my life was not all bad , ' @entity57 said .			0

@entity2 , @entity4 , has treated 8,000 sufferers since it opened in 1866
sufferers were banished there after @entity165 king brought in quarantine *law*
