home : a neighbour of the @entity41 and @entity42 at @entity43 ( pictured ) , the @entity1 is one of the 40,000 men in @entity45 each year who are affected by prostate cancer prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the @entity45 , although the numbers of those with the disease is on the rise			1
every year in the @entity45 more than 40,000 men are struck with prostate cancer , around one in eight around 250,000 are currently living with the disease , with symptoms including frequent trips to the toilet , pain during sex and reduced flow of urine			1
prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra , and not all men diagnosed with prostate cancer have symptoms , meaning it is important to speak regularly with doctors			1
the chances of developing prostate cancer increase as people get older , with the majority of cases developing in men aged 50 or older			2
some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages , with treatments including surgically removing the prostate , radiotherapy and hormone therapy			1
other cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread			0
if the cancer spreads to other parts of the body , typically the bones , it can not be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms			0
as prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly , those with the disease can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment .			2
