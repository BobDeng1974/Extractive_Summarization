deep in the flat and featureless landscape of eastern @entity3 , it is all too ­ possible that the outline of @entity5 is taking shape			1
whipped up by the @entity8 ­ propaganda machine and led by @entity10 ­ military intelligence , armed men are erecting road blocks , storming police stations and ripping down the country ’s flag			1
they are demolishing not just their own country — bankrupt , ill - run and beleaguered — but also the post-war order that has kept most of @entity20 and us , here in @entity23 , safe and free for @entity24 is striking at the heart of the @entity26			1
the profoundly depressing fact is that the events of the past few months , as @entity10 has annexed the @entity42 and @entity43 suppressed opposition in @entity3 , have shown the @entity26 to be divided , humiliated and powerless in the face of these land grabs			1
we are soon to face a bleak choice			0
we can chose to surrender any responsibility we have to protect @entity3 and the @entity49 — almost certainly @entity24 ’s next target — from further @entity10 incursion			1
or we can mount a last - ditch attempt to deter @entity10 from furthering its imperial ambitions			1
if we do choose to resist @entity24 , we will risk a terrifying military escalation , which i do not think it an exaggeration to say could bring us to the brink of nuclear war			1
and he believes we will choose surrender			1
for the real story of recent events in @entity3 is not about whether that country has a free - trade deal with @entity66 or gets its gas from @entity68			1
it is about brute power			0
it is about whether @entity72 — a rogue state on @entity20 ’s doorstep — can hold its neighbours to ­ ransom , and whether we have the will to resist him			0
so far the answer to the first question is yes			0
and to the second a bleak no. the @entity10 leader believes the collapse of the @entity83 was a ‘ geopolitical catastrophe ’			1
he believes @entity10 was stripped of its empire by the @entity26 ’s chicanery			1
and quite simply , he wants it back			0
when the @entity83 was ­ dissolved in 1991 , the former captive nations of @entity20 scrambled into @entity89 and the protection it offered as fast as they could			0
as the tension escalates a @entity96 air force @entity93 fighter patrols an area 100 miles from the @entity10 border in estern @entity99 but the bitter truth is that @entity10 did not reform its ambitions in 1991			1
the @entity8 has always retained its imperialist outlook			0
while modern @entity103 has ­ forsworn militarism and empire , and is liked and admired even by countries such as @entity107 , which suffered horribly at @entity109 ’s hands , @entity10 has @entity110 believes its historic destiny gives @entity10 the right to seize land , intimidate and blockade its neighbours			1
the @entity10 leader sees @entity3 not as a real country , just a territory , and one he is determined to dominate			1
now he has launched an operation in the east and south of @entity123 troops are prowling the border as the @entity3 authorities launch a desperate attempt to regain control of government buildings and police stations in key ­ cities that have been seized and occupied in recent days			1
as the situation continues to deteriorate , @entity96 soldiers stand guard beside a military helicopter to prevent @entity137 activists from seizing the aircraft only yesterday it was reported that between four and 11 people had been killed as @entity3 troops re-took @entity142 from @entity137 forces			1
@entity24 has presented the @entity3 leaders with an impossible choice			1
either they consent to the dismemberment of their country			0
or they fight a war they can not win			0
@entity3 ’s ill - trained , ill - equipped and ill - led soldiers are quite unsuited to deal with the fraught challenge facing them			1
any bloodshed against a single @entity10 soldier will give @entity24 a pretext to use his military might.for her part , @entity10 has played a brutally clever game			1
she has ­ deliberately sought to humiliate and destabilise @entity3			1
now @entity24 can claim his soldiers must be allowed to intervene because the very social disorder his outriders have engineered demonstrates that the authorities can not maintain order			2
a @entity3 soldier aims his machine gun at @entity137 protesters outside a @entity3 airbase in @entity142 , in eastern @entity3 the hypocrisy is breath - taking			1
but the @entity3 adventure is ­ stoking a patriotic frenzy at home which ­ distracts the public from his regime ’s incompetence and thievery			2
but the biggest benefit to the ­ @entity10 president lies abroad			2
he makes no secret of his hatred for the @entity26			2
he is contemptuous of , yet fears , our soft power			0
he resents the laws , liberty and prosperity that our citizens enjoy			0
they throw into bleak contrast the dismal life that his own ­ corrupt and incompetent rule offers @entity10			2
he also despises our weakness			0
he sees a @entity20 and @entity196 that talk tough but have failed to ­ provide a united response to the growing catastrophe			0
yes , we talk a good game — foreign secretary @entity200 has called for ‘ a clear and united international response ’ — but our deeds do not match our words , and @entity24 knows it			2
in his bleak world view , only force and money count			0
he believes we in the @entity26 are too weak to defend ourselves when threatened			2
so far , his assessment looks right			0
even @entity89 — the bulwark of our security since 1949 — is creaking under the strain of the @entity3 crisis			2
@entity89 ’s gutsy commander , general @entity215 , wants to share international intelligence with @entity3 and boost @entity89 ’s forces in its most vulnerable member countries : @entity107 and the @entity49 of @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			1
but the @entity222 has blocked the first recommendation			0
and @entity225 countries such as ­ @entity103 are blocking the second			0
meanwhile , @entity137 protesters attempt to barricade the same airbase in @entity229 , in eastern @entity3 vainly , our leaders hope diplomacy will make @entity24 back down			1
surely he can be made to understand that confrontation is not in @entity10 ’s interests ? the markets are already punishing the rouble and big ­ @entity10 companies			2
but that approach fundamentally misunderstands a man like @entity24			2
he is prepared to make his people suffer economic pain and risk war for what be believes is their national interest			2
we in the @entity26 are not			2
having taken @entity3 , he will turn his attention to the @entity49			1
members of the @entity248 and @entity89 , their lawful societies , elections and ­ thriving economies are an implicit rebuke to those who preside over sleaze and brutality in @entity10			2
now @entity24 sees a chance to humiliate them — and the @entity26			1
he does not need to invade , just to provoke			0
using social division and agitation he will raise the pressure — whether economic or political — on one or more of the @entity49 states until it becomes unbearable			2
@entity89 and the @entity248 — on current form — will merely appeal for ­ dialogue and threaten sanctions			0
­ but nothing will happen			0
which means the @entity49 will buckle , and @entity24 will take back lands which he believes are rightly @entity10 ’s			1
that will be the end of @entity89 — and the dawn of a terrifying new world in which international rules count for nothing and the strong dominate the weak			0
@entity10 — ruthless and greedy — can play divide and rule for decades to come			0
suppose we do try to resist , with our shrunken armed forces and craven allies ? with the latest round of cuts , the @entity278 is about to become the smallest it ’s been since the napoleonic wars			0
a @entity3 army @entity284 helicopter gunship patrols an area around @entity30 while @entity3 authorities plan a clampdown on @entity290 activists meanwhile , our once ‘ special ­ relationship ’ with @entity196 was tested by our ­ failure to support @entity292 over intervention in @entity294			0
what ’s worse , the @entity26 ’s ­ intelligence operations have been severely ­ compromised by the exploits of @entity299 , the former @entity196 intelligence contractor who has taken refuge in @entity68 , having stolen tens of thousands of secret state documents			0
deplorably , the complacent and self - indulgent journalists who so damagingly published the @entity26 ’s intelligence secrets and effectively blinded our spies have been awarded @entity196 ’s greatest journalistic honour , the @entity308			1
if the @entity26 does stand up to ­ @entity10 , @entity24 will put its nuclear forces on alert , all the while decrying our ‘ aggressive behaviour ’			1
as the centenary of the @entity315 in july approaches , historians are vying to pinpoint the chain of events which started that conflict			0
i may be wrong , but in 100 years time , will their successors look back at the events in @entity3 to make sense of the beginnings of the next world conflagration ? @entity326 is author of @entity327			0
a new edition will be published in may ( @entity329 , £ 9.99 ) @entity330 is away			0

' @entity332 is striking at the heart of the @entity26 '
' we can chose to surrender any responsibility we have to protect @entity3 and the @entity49 '
' or we can mount a last - ditch attempt to deter @entity10 from furthering its imperial ambitions '
' if we choose to resist @entity24 , we will risk a terrifying *miltary* escalation '
' i do not think it an exaggeration to say this could bring us to the brink of nuclear war '
