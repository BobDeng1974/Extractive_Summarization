@entity0 and @entity1 played key roles as @entity3 wrapped up a four - wicket victory over @entity5 within four days of the second test in @entity7			1
the tourists had resumed on 71 for one in their second innings , but @entity0 claimed four wickets and crucially sparked a middle - order collapse which saw @entity5 eventually bowled out for 224			1
@entity12 provided some resistance for @entity15 's men with a stubborn 81 , despite battling a wrist injury he sustained in the practice nets before the day 's play			0
@entity0 is congratulated after leading @entity3 to victory in the second test with @entity5 in @entity7 @entity3 lost six second innings wickets , but @entity0 ( left ) and @entity22 saw them home @entity0 had earlier inflicted damage with the ball , here celebrating the wicket of @entity26 @entity0 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity28 , one of four @entity30 batsmen he dismissed but @entity0 's brilliance and @entity5 's demise left @entity3 needing 128 for victory , and a half - century from opener @entity1 set them on their way to a resounding win and a 2 - 0 series lead , despite losing six wickets along the way			1
@entity5 's troubles began even before play had started when @entity12 was unable to resume his innings having been struck on the wrist in the nets			2
things then went from bad to worse as @entity0 quickly turned the contest in @entity3 's favour			2
his first victim of the day was @entity51 , bowled for a single , with @entity28 ( 10 ) and @entity53 soon following , the latter edging to wicket - keeper @entity55 for a duck			0
@entity15 had also failed to trouble the scorers when he was removed by @entity58 just three deliveries later and @entity5 looked more than precarious on 87 for five			0
@entity61 opener @entity1 marks his half - century as @entity3 chased down the 128 needed @entity1 ' innings helped @entity3 take a 2 - 0 lead in the series , which resumes in @entity65 on @entity66 @entity22 and @entity0 celebrate after steering @entity3 home at @entity68 @entity69 , who had been watching the debacle unfold at the other end of the crease , and @entity73 ( 19 ) managed to steer the tourists past the 100 - run mark but the latter then became @entity78 's only scalp with @entity55 pouching another catch			1
when @entity69 's resistance was also ended , by @entity58 on 43 , it seemed as though @entity5 were spent but @entity12 returned to the middle and joined forces with @entity26 to finally get the runs flowing			2
the pair put on an eighth - wicket stand of 60 as @entity5 marched past the 200 - mark before @entity89 's straighter delivery had @entity12 trapped lbw , ending a brave display from the left - hander			0
@entity93 's second wicket soon followed with the dismissal of @entity95 while @entity0 and @entity55 combined once more to end @entity26 's stay on 30 and leave the paceman with figures of four for 61			0
@entity99 is run out by @entity26 as @entity3 stumbled in their second innings run chase @entity99 made 28 runs from 39 balls , helping @entity3 secure a 2 - 0 series lead wicket - taker @entity107 ( second right ) celebrates with his team after removing @entity110 for six @entity53 took three wickets for 38 runs to give @entity5 hope of pulling off an unlikely victory @entity5 celebrate after taking the wicket of @entity116 ( centre ) for a duck , caught @entity15 bowled @entity53 @entity3 's target of 128 - with one and a bit sessions remaining - looked simple enough , although they did it the hard way as the wickets tumbled			1
two of those fell to @entity107 before tea , with @entity110 ( 6 ) and @entity116 ( 0 ) the men to depart			0
more worryingly , @entity110 's fitness is now a major concern for the third test after he was struck by @entity26 during his short stay at the crease and suffered a thumb injury			0
it was left to @entity1 to get @entity3 's run chase going and his swashbuckling 55 from 57 balls , including 10 boundaries , was just what the @entity7 crowd needed to settle any nerves			1
@entity1 ' dismissal , again by @entity53 , left the hosts on 85 for three while @entity143 ( 17 ) , first - innings centurion @entity99 ( 28 ) and @entity55 ( 1 ) also departed in a messy spell , but @entity22 eventually hit the runs which saw them across the line .			2

@entity3 beat @entity5 by four wickets in second test match in @entity7
hosts now lead the series 2 - 0 after securing victory within four days
@entity5 resumed on 71 - 1 in their second innings but were bowled out for 224
