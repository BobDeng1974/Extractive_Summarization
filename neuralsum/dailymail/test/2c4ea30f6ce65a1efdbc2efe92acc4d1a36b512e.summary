two men who became locked inside an airtight bank vault for six hours had to be dramatically rescued by firefighters using heavy drills			1
@entity4 , 21 , and @entity5 , 29 , were at an art exhibition at a former bank building when the vault door shut behind them , leaving them trapped in total darkness			1
the pair - who had only met earlier that night - were fed water through a tube to prevent them becoming dehydrated while police kept in contact with them to check their oxygen levels were not getting dangerously low			1
after their six - hour ordeal , eventually fire crews with specialist drills were able to cut through the thick concrete walls			1
trapped : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) pose for a selfie after getting trapped in the vault locked in : the pair - who only met earlier in the night - were shut inside the vault for almost six hours exhibition : the duo had attended the launch of the exhibition at the @entity36 art space in @entity38 's @entity37 mr @entity4 , who is from @entity39 , has described the incident at the launch night of an exhibition at the @entity36 art space in @entity38 's @entity37 as ' pretty nuts '			1
it was hosting the opening of the @entity47 exhibition described by its curators as ' an eyeball massacre and a massage of visionary art. ' one of the exhibition rooms was the 6m x 6m old bank vault with its thick metal door held ajar			1
the 21 - year - old - who admits he was a ' little drunk ' - went into the vault with fellow art enthusiast mr @entity5 at 1am			1
when he tried to close the door slightly , it shut fully and inadvertently activated the lock			2
he said : ' we were just in there and realised there was a really nice echo in the room			0
i went to shut the door a tiny bit and it shut the whole way			2
' at first we sort of laughed , but when we phoned out friends to come and let us out they could n't			0
' after about 20 minutes of hearing banging on the door we realised no one could get us out			2
you would think someone would have the code for the door			2
' rescue mission : fire crews had to save the pair and this meant the exhibition was shut on saturday light : the emergency crews managed to drill through the wall and pass the pair glow sticks and ear plugs although the two art enthusiasts could hear noise outside , they were unaware what was going on , but were told the fire service had been called			1
the first crews arrived at 1.48am and initially tried to unlock the door			2
but when that did n't work , they had to drill through the wall to create a hole large enough for the two men to escape			0
' they tried drilling for two hours but then had to call for back - up and then more back - up , ' mr @entity4 said			2
part of @entity105 , in @entity38 , was closed for the emergency services to access the building			2
the initial amusement and novelty of the situation quickly wore off , said mr @entity4			2
' we started off with fairly high hopes			0
the first few hours we were singing and running around the room and trying to make the best of it			0
' after two or three hours , before there was an air hole , we started to think " are we going to get out of here ? " '			0
at that point , two fire engines and a specialist urban search and rescue team arrived and use drilling equipment to penetrate the thick concrete walls			1
the emergency crews drilled a small hole through the vault door to speak to the pair and passed them glow sticks for light and ear plugs			1
they then handed them a plastic tube through a hole to enable them to drink water			0
strangers : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) were locked in the vault in total darkness for six hours mr @entity4 , a former lab technician at @entity140 , added : ' we got a phone call about every half an hour from a police woman who kept asking us if our oxygen levels were ok			1
' it was worrying but i told them if it does run out what can they do for us anyway ? ' the fire crews drilled around 15 inch - wide holes into the thick wall , which was reinforced with metal bars			1
they eventually created a big enough hole for the two men to crawl out unharmed at 6.45am			0
exhibition curator @entity159 , 31 , said they always kept the vault door open for ' health and safety reasons '			1
she said : ' some people were messing around and have physically closed the door themselves which is pretty difficult in itself			2
' they have turned the wheel lock door mechanism and could n't get back out			0
we were informed immediately and phoned the emergency services straight away			0
' when the two men came out they were in good spirits and were unharmed			0
' ms @entity159 said the artists took over the former bank last june for no rent because the building will be demolished in two years to make way for the new @entity176 headquarters			0
she said there was no chance of a repeat incident because the vault door was now permanently locked			1
a @entity182 spokeswoman said : ' it 's an unusual one by any stretch of the imagination			0
' we received a call to a premises at 1.48am			0
two male persons were rescued from an internal bank vault			1
' there was a limited air supply in the nature of it being a bank vault and our urban search and rescue team were called in with specialist equipment			1
' there were no injuries			0
we were assisted by paramedics and police were also in attendance			0
' the gallery was closed on saturday , but will reopen as normal on wednesday .			0
