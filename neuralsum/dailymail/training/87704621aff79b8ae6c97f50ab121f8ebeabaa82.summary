ladies , the next time the man in your life complains you talk too much , silence him with science			0
tell him - at length , of course - it is all because of the @entity9 protein			2
it has been claimed previously that women speak about 20,000 words a day - some 13,000 more than the average man			1
it has been claimed that women speak about 20,000 words a day - 13,000 more than the average man - and scientists say a higher amount of the @entity9 protein is the reason women are more chatty but now scientists have found the key to explaining why women are the more talkative sex			1
a study just published suggests that higher levels of the protein are found in the female brain			1
@entity29 researchers found that those with more @entity9 , known as the ‘ language protein ’ , in their brains were the chattier			1
among humans that was women , but in rats it was the males			2
the researchers set out to determine what might make male rats more vocal than their female cage mates			1
they separated four - day - old pups from their mothers and counted the number of times they cried out			0
both male and female pups emitted hundreds of cries , but the males called out twice as often			0
as a result , when the pups were put back in the same cage as their mother , she fussed over her sons first			0
researchers found the so - called ' language protein ' that makes women more talkative also causes male rats to be more vocal than their female cage mates tests on the parts of the brain known to be involved in vocal calls showed the male pups to have up to twice as much @entity9 protein as the females			1
the researchers then ramped up its production in the brains of female pups and reduced it in males			0
this led to the female rats crying out more often and their mothers showing more interest to them			0
the males in contrast , became less ‘ talkative ’ , the @entity76 reports			0
next , the @entity80 researchers tested samples from ten boys and girls aged between three and five			2
this showed the girls to have 30 per cent more of the @entity9 protein than the boys , in a brain area key to language in humans			2
researcher @entity95 said : ‘ based on our observations , we postulate higher levels of @entity9 in girls and higher levels of @entity9 in male rats is an indication that @entity9 protein levels are associated with the more communicative sex			1
’ studies have shown that the female love of chit - chat begins at a young age			0
girls learn to speak earlier and more quickly than boys			1
they produce their first words and sentences earlier , have larger vocabularies and use a greater variety of sentence types than boys of the same age			2
however , @entity112 , one of the @entity114 team who first pinpointed the protein , cautioned against drawing big conclusions from a study of such a small number of children .			0

researchers have found women have higher levels of @entity9 protein
team from @entity80 found male rats - the chattier gender in rodents - make more of the protein than female
previously been claimed that woman speak 20,000 words a day
girls learn to speak earlier and more quickly than boys
