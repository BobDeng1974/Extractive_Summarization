by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 17 july 2013 two con artists posed as a high - flying couple looking for a new home so they could find empty luxury accommodation to squat in , a court heard today			1
married @entity6 and @entity7 are accused of using the elaborate ruse to find out which high - value properties around the @entity10 were sitting empty so they could move in quickly and live there rent free until they were forced out			1
a jury was today told how the couple had already been convicted for a similar stunt in @entity15 when they decided to embark on another property scam in @entity17 - changing their names so sellers would n't read about them in the press			2
the jeromes , of @entity24 , @entity25 , are now on trial at @entity27 where they have denied eight fraud charges			1
con artists : @entity6 and @entity7 , who were convicted of fraud in 2009 after posing as a rich couple looking for a new home so they could find empty properties to squat in , are accused of carrying out the same scam in a different part of @entity10 prosecutor @entity37 told the jury : ' the two defendants are habitual confidence tricksters			1
' he said they have developed a ruse where they pose as rich cash buyers of upmarket properties and end up living in them rent free until they are eventually forced out			1
he said : ' they pose as a wealthy couple who are interested in buying expensive properties			1
' he said 65 - year - old @entity51 , known as @entity52 , pretends to have ‘ substantial business interests abroad ’ while his wife , 63 - year - old @entity53 , is a retired schoolteacher			0
the jury was told how the couple have already been convicted for carrying out incredibly similar housing fraud after a court case held at @entity59 in 2009			1
the court heard how after posing as a wealthy couple , they made cash offers on two expensive houses which were on sale with vacant possession			2
then they would spin tales and lies as they explained delays in the house purchase - and ask to rent in the interim but never handed over any money			1
the jeromes have previously been convicted for living rent - free in this house @entity73 for a year the jury heard that one couple from this previous scam lost £ 167,000 on the value of the property and unpaid bills and rent			1
@entity51 was jailed for 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception while his wife was given a ten month suspended term after she too admitted fraud			2
mr @entity37 said they used the same methods when they turned their attention to the @entity90 country			0
the court heard that in @entity92 , @entity93 , the @entity71 claimed they wanted to buy a house for their base in the @entity10 because they lived for six months each year in @entity96			2
they made an offer of £ 310,000 on the property but then blamed delays on @entity51 being seriously ill and his recuperation			0
convicted : fraudsters @entity6 and @entity7 pictured in 2009 when they were first convicted for operating the property scam but mr @entity37 said when they made that offer they had already pleaded not guilty to the frauds in the @entity107 case			1
the prosecutor said it was ‘ somewhat surprising ’ they could splash out £ 310,000 on the house when they had three county court judgements against them for various sums of money			2
he said the @entity117 ‘ work together ’ and @entity119 ‘ takes the lead and does the talking ’ but @entity7 plays her part as they tell vendors about their ‘ fantastical lifestyle ’			1
the court heard the purchase of the @entity93 house was still going on when the couple later admitted the fraud in @entity59 crown court			1
the seller then read about the @entity117 ' fiddle in newspapers and baled out without losing too much money on the deal			2
the @entity71 then turned their attention to another property in @entity136 , @entity17 - one on a cliff top with lovely sea views			0
but this time they allegedly used a false surname - @entity139 - so the seller would n't hear of the court case			0
they again posed as a wealthy couple with international business interests with a cash deal for the £ 750,000 property - not long after @entity51 had been released from jail			1
the court heard they wanted to complete the deal in two and a half weeks but then made another series of excuses for delays and problems blaming solicitors and illness			0
but a surveyor they used and failed to pay for his work discovered their real identities and alerted the various parties and the police became involved again			0
the jeromes were arrested at their home			2
@entity51 questioned why police wanted his passport saying that he had not been abroad for two years - despite telling vendors that he was a high flier travelling around the world constantly			0
police also recovered bank statements which showed he never had more than £ 200 in his account			0
he refused to comment in police interviews while his wife denied being involved in any fraud and said she lived off her state pension and her school teacher pension			1
she said they had looked to buy a retirement home in the @entity90 country for £ 300,000 or more and was told by her husband that his off shore company would making the purchase			0
@entity183 : the couple have also previously been convicted of squatting for six months in this cottage in @entity187 , @entity188 the court was also told how private school headteacher @entity190 was duped into handing @entity51 £ 10,000 after meeting him through a dating website			0
miss @entity190 , from @entity192 , @entity193 , said : ' he told me that he was divorced			0
he said he worked in the money markets and said that he had been in the @entity196 and worked for @entity197 all around the world			0
' she said they first met on line in 2003 but they only met in person six to eight times in five years			0
she said he told her he needed some money to finalise a deal and she ‘ stupidly ’ gave him £ 4,400			0
she gave @entity51 a further £ 5,000 to help her set up a mortgage - but she ended up doing it herself and never saw the cash again			0
she called him ‘ extremely plausible ’ but she never got her money back even when she asked for it			0
she told @entity27 : ' i loaned him a total in excess of £ 10,000 and got none of it back			2
' the @entity71 deny eight joint fraud charges in @entity93 , @entity17 and @entity220			1
