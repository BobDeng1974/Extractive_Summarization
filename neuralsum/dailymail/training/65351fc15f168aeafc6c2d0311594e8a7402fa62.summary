by dr @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 november 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 2 november 2013 there are few subjects as divisive among parents as discipline			2
all mothers will have heard tut - tutting at the school gates about those children who ' get away with murder '			1
at the same time , we worry that our own tantrum - prone toddler is suffering from autism - as one in 100 does - or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity17 )			1
of course , when it 's not your own child , it 's easy to see these as an excuse for bad parenting			2
the expulsion from school of five - year - old @entity26 demonstrated both sides of this coin			2
while his mother believes autism and @entity17 cause his disruptive behaviour , one teacher was said to have called him the naughtiest child she had ever met			1
sadly , everyone involved was struggling to deal with this case			2
@entity37 's famously bratty @entity36 could have had a medical condition there is a knee - jerk tendency to claim that doctors are bent on giving every stroppy child a ' chemical cosh ' - but this is simply not true			2
sometimes , naughtiness genuinely is the symptom of a medical condition			2
and recognising that is the key to getting a child help			0
being defiant and testing boundaries is just a normal part of growing up			0
is n't it counterproductive to classify a child as ill ? of course children have a range of personalities and it is to be expected that some will push boundaries far more than others			1
moreover , all children go through phases , whether they are two - year - olds or teenagers , when they defy authority			1
this kind of behaviour can also be a reaction to problems in their environment - is there something distressing going on at home or school , for example ? the mental health of children and adolescents is a complex field and the best general advice i can give is to be watchful , without worrying or being overbearing			1
however , alarm bells should ring when a child 's behaviour goes far beyond that of his or her contemporaries , and continues to a point where life at home and at school is persistently being disrupted			0
in that case , it is absolutely worth speaking to a doctor , as this behaviour could indeed be symptomatic of a medical condition			0
@entity96 and son @entity26 who has been excluded from his primary school what kind of medical conditions are we talking about ? today , we believe that up to five per cent of children have @entity17			1
this diagnosis is made when a child shows a specific set of symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness			0
it is generally thought to be down to brain function and anatomy , and the condition often runs in families			1
one possible cause is the mother drinking alcohol and smoking during pregnancy ; another is the child watching too much tv			1
two - thirds of children with @entity17 still have problems as teenagers , and the same proportion continue to suffer as adults			1
@entity17 can often go hand - in - hand with learning disabilities and sleep problems			1
it is , however , by no means the only cause of disruptive behaviour			0
what we traditionally think of as autism is often diagnosed before a child begins education , but it is only part of the range of illnesses known as @entity142 ( @entity142 ) , any of which may cause what looks like naughtiness			0
in a child with a mild @entity142 , the symptoms may have been subtle before starting school , or the classroom setting may actually bring out new , previously unseen symptoms			0
other health problems such as deafness and epilepsy can also be manifested as difficult behaviour before they are diagnosed			0
so why are we suddenly giving children these labels - and medicating them - when the conditions used not to exist ? we are more aware nowadays of all learning and mental health problems in children			1
and this awareness is a positive step towards educating and supporting children who may previously have been disregarded by schools			1
the fact that these conditions are newly defined does not mean we invented them for the sake of it			0
while many children are restless from time to time , a child with @entity17 is persistently restless and ca n't concentrate in any situation			1
these diagnoses are not made in a brief consultation			0
information is gathered from the youngster 's school and gp , as well as observing him or her in different settings performing different tasks			1
the features of @entity17 have to have been present for more than six months for a diagnosis to be made.on the other hand , children with @entity142 primarily find social situations difficult			1
they have trouble understanding other people 's emotions , so , for example , may carry on ' misbehaving ' even when someone is upset or angry with them			0
children with @entity142 like routine and can express anger and aggression when these are changed			1
they often can not understand non-verbal cues such as tone of voice or facial expression , while they can be blunt when talking , which gets them into trouble			0
is n't it ludicrous to expect a mainstream school to cope with a child with extreme behaviour even if there is a medical cause for it ? if a diagnosis has been made , it is not unreasonable that a school should try to cope			0
all children with special needs should be ' statemented '			2
this means a statement of educational need is made and the child is then provided with a plan to meet those needs			0
they should be assisted within the classroom , which often involves one - to - one help			0
properly organised and funded intervention can have a very positive effect			0
once a diagnosis is established and a proper plan has been put in place , mainstream schools can cope very well			2
the diagnosis of a disorder means that parents , teachers and children can be taught how to avoid triggers and manage problem behaviour			2
how can i get help for my child if his or her naughtiness does appear to be excessive ? a proper assessment is vital			1
this can start with a chat with your gp , who may suggest that a formal examination needs to be made by a community paediatric team , which includes an educational psychologist			1
in some cases the school will actually initiate this			0
once a child has been assessed , the appropriate measures should be put in place at the school , whether that is help from a classroom assistant or extra one - to - one care			0
this should occur in conjunction with therapy or medication for the child , as well as a parent training programme to teach effective communication and the skills required to deal with difficult behaviour .			0
