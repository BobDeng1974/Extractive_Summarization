at the end of last week familiar and worrying pictures emerged of @entity2 from a @entity4 training session			1
sitting on his backside on the grass at @entity10 , the @entity6 centre forward looked as though he was being coaxed to his feet by @entity13			2
those who worked with @entity2 at @entity15 will have recognised the sketch straight away for whenever he used to make a mistake in training during his first stint in @entity22 football he would simply fall over			1
it was endearing , for about a session - and - a - half			2
' i had never seen anything like it , ' said one of @entity47 's coaches			2
' when @entity2 made a mistake – like a wayward shot or a poor corner – he would often fall over , as though he was hurt			1
' it was like watching a kid trying to cover up a mistake			0
' it was ridiculous and , in the end , we just recognised it as classic @entity2			1
@entity2 takes time out during @entity15 training as he watches on and sits on a ball former @entity15 manager @entity47 remonstrates with @entity2 during training at @entity15 ' when things go wrong , his first instinct is not to put them right but to look for excuses			1
' as @entity2 's career stalls on the runway at @entity4 , @entity13 and his staff should be concerned			1
the @entity4 manager has a brilliant record at @entity71 of improving players			1
he has improved @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , for example			0
he even managed to improve @entity77			0
it 's one of his qualities as a coach			0
it may just be , though , that he has taken on too much with @entity2			1
the signs of a downward spiral are already in place			0
@entity2 looks dejected during his days at @entity15 as the club drew with @entity86 in the @entity87 @entity2 's form looks to be a long way from that which saw him reveal the ' @entity92 ? ' t - shirt in 2011 on sunday at @entity94 , the 24 - year - old did not concentrate as much as he should , he did not work as hard as he should and , as a result , he did not execute in front of goal as well as he should			1
one of the problems with the former @entity100 striker is that – deep down – he lacks mental strength and confidence			1
it is why he was so reluctant to mix socially during his time at @entity15 , why at times @entity47 's own son had to be sent to coax him from his flat in @entity107			0
@entity2 has never really grasped what it takes to overcome difficulty			1
he reacts to adversity the wrong way			2
at @entity94 , young @entity73 reacted to his own recent difficulties by running his legs in to the ground			0
he 's back on track already			0
@entity2 has another unsuccessful shot on goal during the win over @entity28 @entity2 slumps on the ground after he misses another chance against @entity28 @entity2 took a different route , though , and seeing video clips of him shooting from hopelessly ambitious positions , it was easy to remember him doing the same in the light blue of @entity15 and the dark blue colours of @entity128 during the summer 's @entity129			1
that 's a classic @entity2 response to draining confidence			1
just hit it and hope that something amazing happens			0
all too often it does n't			0
unfortunately for @entity13 , @entity2 's current issues will start to affect team - mates at @entity10			2
they will react negatively to his aimless training efforts and his inability to bring something to the team even when his goalscoring form is beyond him			0
one can only hope that something happens for him against @entity144 on wednesday night			0
it needs to happen soon			0
for history tells us that when @entity2 gets stuck in the wrong direction , he soon gathers all the negative momentum of a lorry heading for the edge of a cliff			2
video we were n't at our best - @entity13			0

@entity2 has yet to score for @entity4 in the @entity30
the @entity4 striker missed a number of good chances against @entity28
@entity2 lacks mental strength and confidence to deal with adversity
