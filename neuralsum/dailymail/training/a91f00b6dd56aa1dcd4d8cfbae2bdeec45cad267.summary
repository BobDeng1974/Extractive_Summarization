the @entity7 star , who received his third @entity8 for most goals in @entity4 for last season on wednesday , now says he wants to be the greatest player ever			1
@entity0 is quoted in the @entity13 papers saying that he believes he has ' a lot of years left ' at @entity7 , and is aiming to be remembered as the greatest of all time , not just for the club , but in the world			2
both @entity18 and @entity19 lead on @entity0 's claim that he can be the greatest player ever however , while the @entity7 - based press focus on their club 's @entity25 star , the @entity22 papers feature his great rival @entity27			1
@entity28 dub the @entity30 star as ' @entity31 of @entity4 ' while @entity32 call the @entity33 forward ' @entity34 '			0
