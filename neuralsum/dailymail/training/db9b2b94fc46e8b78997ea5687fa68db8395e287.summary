by @entity0 an inmate who claims to be a practicing @entity2 has accused prison bosses of ' intolerance and bigotry ' after they refused to recognise his @entity7 - based beliefs			1
the prisoner at @entity9 & @entity10 , a 622 - capacity category @entity11 for young offenders on the @entity15 site in south @entity16 , said he was being denied his ‘ right ’ to follow the religion , which is based on the @entity7 films			1
the unnamed prisoner - who says he fears ‘ retaliation from the @entity21 ’ if he is identified - said he was unhappy his right to religious freedom was being denied			2

' please withhold my name in the paper as i fear retaliation from the @entity21			0
may the force be with you			0
' the religion , which preaches meditation and ‘ accessing ancient inner knowledge ’ before making decisions , was officially recognised in the 2001 @entity43 census , when it was the fourth most popular in the @entity43			1
according to group @entity78 , those who follow @entity80 are not role players , and are not the same as the fictional characters in the @entity7 films			1

' it ’s discrimination , pure and simple - especially as it is now a recognised religion on the census			2
