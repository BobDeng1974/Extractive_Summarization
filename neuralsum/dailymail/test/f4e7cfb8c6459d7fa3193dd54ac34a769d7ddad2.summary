has this brilliant 79th masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on sunday ? no - one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round , when the three biggest names in the sport combined with @entity7 to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old @entity10 @entity9			1
the young @entity11 coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner @entity14 in the final round armed with a useful advantage			1
but there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to @entity14 but @entity21 specialist @entity21 , who will start five behind			0
@entity9 is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round			1
it worked out perfectly for @entity26 in 1997 but not so well for @entity27 in 2011 , who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes			1
‘ i think @entity31 will cope better than i did because he was in the final group last year , ’ said @entity27			1
‘ i certainly expect him to cope a lot better than i did			0
’ @entity9 carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54 - hole scoring record at the masters at 16 under par , @entity9 broke the record shared by @entity42 and @entity26 by a single shot the other thing @entity9 has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round			1
he won one and finished runner - up in the other two			2
if he wins , he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with @entity27 that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun			1
@entity9 looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play			1
but while @entity14 finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes , @entity9 was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th			1
and at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three , before @entity9 conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous masters sunday			1
plucky journeyman @entity69 lies fourth while @entity26 and @entity27 both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on sunday			1
but at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind			0
as for @entity14 , the @entity74 champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish			0
pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th , where he holed a spectacular bunker shot			1
‘ i think it ’s important to be in the final group , it ’s where you want to be , ’ said the 34 year old @entity81			2
‘ @entity31 is obviously playing some very special golf but i have definitely given myself an opportunity			0
’ @entity89 1 @entity27 and 14 - time major winner @entity26 were in a five - way tie for fifth finally , the real @entity27 showed upon the par fives at @entity92 on saturday what a day we had on saturday			1
it was as if @entity14 and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared : ‘ ok , let ’s see if this kid @entity31 is really destined for greatness			0
’ for those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket , we had @entity27 playing like the world number one and @entity26 confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream			1
there was the glorious sight of @entity21 playing once more like he owns @entity92			0
and then there was @entity14 , who has had a lot of good days at @entity92 in his ten @entity114 tournaments and now was enjoying one more			0
how would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror , at this of all courses ? in short , for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in @entity9 ’s direction			1
this was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round			2
just as well , then , that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be : ’ whenever the heat is on , ensure you focus just that little bit more			0
’ and that , for the most part , is just what he did			0
only at the end did he look like stumbling , but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat			0
@entity26 put on a vintage show , he was astonishing , electric , inspired and charismatic @entity26 ' girlfriend @entity141 showed her support during the third round on saturday the previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by @entity42 in 1976 and @entity26 in 1997			1
but the youngest first round leader in @entity114 history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on friday had reached 16 under after a 70			1
what made this so impressive was that , for the first time , a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game			0
during the round he would have three three putts and his first double			2
when things like this happen here it ’s so easy for the mind to unravel but @entity9 kept his composure			1
at the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth			2
at the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot , from a downhill lie to an elevated green			2
@entity9 knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots			1
in its own way , this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds			0
the two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag			2
you can guess what happened next , and he birdied the 13th as well			0
he would threeputt the 14th , however – and then came the next test			0
@entity21 played like the @entity114 specialist to finish the third round on 11 under @entity7 reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under as he made his way down the 15th fairway , first @entity21 and then @entity14 made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures			1
how would he respond ? well , at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie			0
best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie			0
@entity27 , @entity26 and @entity21 all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots			1
@entity21 was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of @entity209			0
some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and @entity21 was doing justice to the memory			0
eight strokes off the pace at the start of play , he ’s still in the ball game but will need another magic - filled round today			2
add @entity27 ’s wonderful back nine 31 from friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday , and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63			1
amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round			2
so tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake , it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided : ‘ to hell with it , let ’s go for it			2
’ finally , the real @entity27 showed up on the par fives , those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years			1
an eagle at the 13th on friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round			2
he was off and running			0
he birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best - ever return on the par fives during a single round at the masters			1
a poor eight iron to the 16th cost him , however , as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably			0
another bogey at the last as well meant a 68			0
and so the likely list of winners stands at just three – @entity9 , @entity14 and @entity21			2
it should be some final day			0
it has been some tournament .			0

@entity9 set a masters record 54 - hole total of 16 - under - par
the @entity11 carding a 70 to take a four - shot lead into the final round
@entity7 *collected* five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under
@entity27 and @entity26 were among those at six under after *68s*
