friday ’s solar eclipse across @entity2 could signal darker times and the ‘ day of judgement , ’ a pastor has warned			1
the timing of the eclipse , which comes a few weeks before a lunar eclipse , is apparently significant			2
coinciding also with the spring equinox , the rare ' once in 100,000 - year ' event could indicate that trouble is brewing in @entity2 , according to the pastor			2
on friday morning , @entity2 will be treated to a partial solar eclipse ( 1999 eclipse shown )			1
but a pastor has warned that it coincides with a so - called ' blood moon '			1
this lunar eclipse , when the moon appears red , occurs a few weeks later			1
he said the chance alignment could be a sign of the end of times the claim was made by pastor @entity24 for the @entity26 website @entity27 in an interview with @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
the partial solar eclipse on friday 20 march is itself fairly rare , as the last solar eclipse in @entity2 occurred back in 1999			1
however , a few weeks later on 4 april , the third of four ‘ blood moon ’ lunar eclipses will take place , while it is also the first day of spring and the first day of the @entity39 religious calendar			1
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity43 , and appears red due to light refracting differently and hitting its surface			1
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity43			2
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the @entity50 is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it makes it appear red			0
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			1
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
‘ an event of this magnitude at the very beginning of the religious new year demands attention , ’ mr @entity24 told wnd			2
‘ as the @entity69 tells us , there will be signs in the heavens on the feast days , and this is a very significant sign on a critical day			0
‘ it ’s the same day that there was the grand - opening ceremony of the tabernacle of @entity78 , with fire from heaven lighting the altar			0
historically , this is a day of judgment			0
’ he also said it was ‘ likely a message from @entity85 to the entire world			1
’ there will also be a partial solar eclipse on 13 september 2015 , followed by the last of the four blood moons - known as a tetrad - on 28 september			1
the previous two occurred on 15 april and 8 october 2014			0
the so - called ‘ blood moon prophecy ’ is apparently a sign that the world is coming to an end			1
mr @entity24 said the last time there were four blood moons in a row , in 1967 , @entity94 captured @entity98			0
a few weeks after friday 's eclipse , on 4 april , the third of four ‘ blood moon ’ lunar eclipses will take place , while it is also the first day of spring and the first day of the @entity39 religious calendar			1
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity43 ‘ an event of this magnitude at the very beginning of the religious new year demands attention , ’ mr @entity24 told wnd			1

' @entity118 is an illustration of the sun , @entity43 and moon in line back in the world of science , the eclipse on friday marks a fascinating opportunity for observers to see the amazing mathematical coincidence take place in the solar system			2
this chart shows what times the eclipse will occur in the @entity134 on friday 20 march experts have warned , however , that no one should attempt to look directly at the sun without specialised solar glasses			2
others have also said that the two - hour event could pose problems for solar power stations across @entity2			2
about three per cent of the total @entity2 energy consumption comes from solar power , and scientists have warned that the risk of blackouts is greater than ever			0
the effects of a momentary dip in output has not been studied before , leading to the suggestion there could be a ' cascade of electricity blackouts ' as power grids struggle to cope			0
meanwhile , scientists will also be using the event to study one of the sun 's biggest mysteries			0
a team based in @entity162 , north of @entity163 , will be hoping to use the event to find out why the sun 's corona - its outer atmosphere - is hotter than its surface			0
the plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse , so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena			0
and in an amazing coincidence , the eclipse will occur over the @entity177 on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years .			0
