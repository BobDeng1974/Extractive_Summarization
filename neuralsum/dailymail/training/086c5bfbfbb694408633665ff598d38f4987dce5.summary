one direction may have scored a hit with the @entity2 , but it seems the best @entity4 gift ever is a ticket to one of their upcoming concerts			1
indeed , @entity9 has been inundated over the past few days with videos of the joyous and sometimes outright hysterical reactions of young girls surprised under the tree with passes to see the @entity16 pop sensation			0
uploaded by parents from @entity19 and across the world , each clip plays out in the same way - as a card is opened only to be followed in a split second of realization by ultrasonic screaming from the grateful daughter			0
sometimes tears follow , or the tears turn to laughter as the shaking recipient thanks their mom and dad for the chance @entity34 and the rest in the flesh			0
in some cases the girls and one boy can not even find the words to express their happiness making up unusual but heartfelt @entity4 scenes			1
even better are the looks of happiness from the parents as they bask in the glory of having made that @entity4 truly special			2
