@entity155 and @entity156 were unsure whether to join the ‘ ammal ’ ( action ) against ‘ infidels ’ in the @entity17 or fight abroad , the court heard			1
they were instructed to practice ‘ istikhara ’ , a prayer intended to help believers make a wise decision , and @entity155 and @entity157 were supplied with ideological material to convince them to join			0
as a result , @entity157 became actively involved as a fundraiser and ‘ fully aware ’ of the other plotters ’ intentions , mr @entity52 said			0
