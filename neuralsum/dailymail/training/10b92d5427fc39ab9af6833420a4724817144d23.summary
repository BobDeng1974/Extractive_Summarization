by @entity0 last updated at 8:29 am on 11th october 2011 rebel fighters in @entity2 have reached the centre of @entity5 's hometown , @entity6 , but there is still no sign of the @entity11 country 's ousted leader			1
anti-regime forces have managed to usurp a convention centre which had previously been used by men loyal to the 69 - year - old in the northern coastal city located between the capital @entity18 and @entity19			2
the inability to take @entity6 - the most important remaining stronghold of @entity5 supporters - more than six weeks after rebels seized the capital , has stalled efforts by @entity2 's new leaders to set a time - line for elections and move forward with a transition to democracy			1
@entity2 rebels fire a rocket as they enter in @entity6 today colonel @entity5 supporters also hold the inland enclave of @entity32 , believed to be harbouring high - level figures in the old regime			1
revolutionary forces also reported key gains in that northern city - located inland to the west of @entity6 - after weeks of faltering advances that resulted in part from the challenging terrain of desert hills and steep valleys			0
the transitional leadership has said it will declare liberation after @entity6 's capture because that will mean it holds all of the seaports and harbours in the oil - rich @entity50 coastal country			0
@entity2 's de facto leader , @entity52 , head of the governing @entity53 , said yesterday that @entity55 fighters have made huge gains in @entity6 and @entity32 , south - east of the capital			1
' i do believe , @entity59 willing , that the liberation of these cities will happen within this week , ' @entity52 said in @entity18			1

a tank fires another missile into @entity6 , as used shells litter the dusty floor			0
but there is no sign of @entity5 more rebel fighters aim at key @entity76 points in the northern coastal city , which they expect to be liberated within the week @entity5 has so far not been hunted down in his hometown of @entity6 in @entity32 , advancing fighters drove @entity5 forces out of the airport , said @entity82 , who led failed talks for the revolutionaries in search of a peaceful surrender of the city			1
' the takeover of @entity32 is imminent , ' he said			2
' the fighters are only one kilometre from the heart of @entity32			1
' he claimed that @entity5 's son @entity92 was seen on saturday distributing cash to his loyalists in @entity32			1
' we are 100 per cent sure that he is inside , at least until last night , ' @entity82 said			0
located 250 miles ( 400 kilometres ) south - east of @entity18 , @entity6 is key to the physical unity of the nation of some six million people , since it lies roughly in the centre of the coastal plain where most @entity2 live , blocking the easiest routes between east and west			0
after a three - week siege from the outskirts , revolutionary forces launched an all - out assault on @entity6 on friday , pounding the city with tank shells , field cannons , rockets and heavy machine guns			2
loyalists have put up fierce resistance , and fired back with sniper rifles , mortars and rocket - propelled grenades			0
on sunday , the @entity118 centre , an ornate complex that @entity5 frequently used for international summits , lay in ruins			2
throughout the siege , @entity5 fighters used the walled complex as a base and stronghold			1
from there they were able to dominate surrounding neighbourhoods and assault revolutionaries trying to enter @entity6			0
in a bloody street battle , a rebel fighter fires a the pockets of remaining @entity76 forces over the weekend at the nearby @entity136 , scores of wounded civilians crowded the corridors , lying on gurneys and floors to protect them from the shelling and gunfire			0
there was no electricity or water , and a handful of medical students and nurses were the only medical staff			0
revolutionary fighters roamed the hallways checking ids and detained about 25 people suspected of being @entity5 fighters or mercenaries			1
' these are all @entity5 people			2
they are snipers and we have captured them , ' said @entity157 , a field commander , as his soldiers cuffed a suspected @entity76 sniper			0
the revolutionary forces also now control the @entity161 on the southern outskirts			0
as they push forward , @entity5 loyalists are fighting in an ever - shrinking defensive perimeter consisting only of a @entity5 palace complex , some residential buildings and a hotel near @entity168 in the city centre .			1
