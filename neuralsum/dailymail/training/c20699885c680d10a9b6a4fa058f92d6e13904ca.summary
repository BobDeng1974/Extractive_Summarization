meanwhile , @entity18 president @entity17 issued a new warning to @entity20 saying the @entity21 will ' refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 21st			1
' reports of 300 dead are not true			0
losses to the @entity1 side were more than ours , ' @entity49 , ' prime minister ' of the self - proclaimed @entity50 , was quoted as saying by @entity55 news agency			2
describing the fighting as ' heavy ' , the government forces spokesman , @entity58 , said two servicemen had been killed and 45 wounded			2
fighting was continuing in @entity8 region and mopping - up operations were underway in the nearby town of @entity64 , which he said government forces had taken control of on tuesday			1
president - elect @entity69 ordered the resumption of operations by government forces to quell the rebellion by @entity28 militia in the @entity20 - speaking east soon after scoring a resounding victory in an election on may 25			0

@entity77 denies this and is urging @entity1 to end military operations and open dialogue with the separatists			2
since government forces resumed their push against the rebels , there have been clashes in and around the main industrial hub of @entity104 and near the border town of @entity32 , with loss of life on both sides			0

@entity146 officials said @entity20 's actions since @entity1 's may 25 presidential elections - muted condemnation and a pullback of troops from @entity1 's border - are better than some had feared , and they hope @entity119 will use those meetings to demonstrate a more positive , engaged attitude			1
in march , the @entity18 and its most important allies retaliated for @entity119 's military occupation and subsequent annexation of @entity1 's @entity162 by suspending @entity20 's membership in what had been the g - 8 club of rich countries			1
they also nixed @entity119 's plan to hold the meeting in @entity171 , the city @entity20 lavished billions on to host the @entity172 , and shifted the venue to a building in the @entity176 capital instead			2

meanwhile , president @entity17 held up 25 years of @entity92 democracy as a beacon for neighboring @entity1 in a public celebration , warning @entity20 that the free world is united against its ' dark tactics ' to violate @entity1 's sovereignty			1
' we stand together because we believe that people and nations have the right to determine their own destiny - that includes the people of @entity1 , ' @entity17 said before a crowd of more than 6,000 that spilled into the streets before @entity226 , a symbol of @entity92 independence			1
' our free nations will stand united so that further @entity20 provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for @entity20 , ' @entity17 said			0
' because after investing so much blood and treasure to bring @entity235 together , we refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 21st			1
' @entity17 spoke just after announcing new @entity18 assistance for @entity1 's armed forces , including body armor and night vision goggles - the first such delivery of tools that would directly help @entity1 troops in their battle against @entity28 separatists			1
speaking from behind protective glass , @entity17 declared that ' the days of empires and spheres of influence are over			0
' ' bigger nations must not be allowed to bully the small , or impose their will at the barrel of a gun or with masked men taking over buildings , ' @entity17 said			0
' and the stroke of a pen can never legitimize the theft of a neighbor 's land			0
so we will never accept @entity20 's occupation of @entity162 or its violations of @entity1 's sovereignty			1
