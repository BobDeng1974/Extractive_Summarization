@entity0 admits he is concerned about the ' pathways ' available for young @entity3 footballers , rather than the ' production line ' but wants more to be done to clear their route to international football			1
as a failed @entity9 campaign ends against @entity10 on tuesday , @entity0 has for the first time addressed the findings of the @entity13 set up last autumn by @entity15 chairman @entity14 with a view to producing more elite players and a better national team			1
the @entity13 manager was part of the @entity13 but has been occupied with his preparations for the tournament in @entity23 since @entity14 unveiled his recommendations last month , which included the radical idea of creating a fifth division where clubs from the @entity28 could play their b - teams			1
humbled : @entity0 ( right ) and captain @entity30 have presided over an awful @entity9 campaign the difference : @entity33 ( centre right ) sent @entity13 tumbling out of the @entity9 with a brace last week ' it ’s not been high on my agenda these last few weeks , ' said @entity0 , but the issue will return to the agenda as the nation digests this @entity9 performance , one which will go down as the worst ever if @entity13 lose to @entity10 in @entity43			1
' my concern is that we ’re going to produce a lot of good players who will merit a place in the teams but will find their place blocked , ' he added			2
' it ’s pathways that concern me more than the production line			0
it ’s a fact of life and one that will take a long time to address , if we address it at all			2
' the first thing we have to concentrate on is to get our own act right with the @entity13 teams			1
we have to make certain that we get as much access as we can to the players in the academies , that we induct them fully into what we ’re expecting , and the academies do some very good work from 17 - 18 , 19 under 21 level			0
' we have to make certain that when the players come into our environment that we induct them fully into what we are expecting , what we think being an @entity13 player means , not just in terms of behaviour and culture , but in terms of how important it is for you to play in a certain way , making certain we get our midfielders turning on the ball , receiving balls on the back foot , being positive			1
we can do some work on that			0
we do n’t just have to rely on clubs giving their 19 - year - old a game in the first - team or not			2
' @entity92 : @entity93 is one of just a few talented @entity13 youngsters to play for a top @entity28 club the kid 's alright : @entity98 is another top talent who will be central to @entity13 's plans in the coming years @entity104 to the ' pathway ' problem is the fact the @entity28 contains such a large proportion of overseas players , and the trend appears set to continue , leaving an ever diminishing pool of elite talent available to the @entity13 manager			1
the lack of experience at the very top has repercussions on @entity13			1
only four of those who started in the @entity119 defeat against @entity120 last week had played in the @entity121 last season			0
although whether the b - team solution , heavily criticised when it was revealed by @entity14 , will cure this problem is debateable			0
' there ’s always going to be a problem , ' said @entity0			2
' it ’s ridiculous to try to suggest there is n’t			0
the players we ’re looking at who could be good enough to play for @entity13 at 18 , 19 , 20 years of age are quite often playing in the top five or six clubs			1
that ’s where the biggest stars are , and where the biggest money is and where the biggest chance of a blockage is in getting into the team			2
so let ’s come to terms with that			0
spot the @entity3 : @entity147 won the @entity28 with a cosmopolitan squad ' let ’s keep looking if there is a system that would help these 19 - year - olds who are not playing in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity147 first - teams			1
is there a way of getting them into football on a regular basis to play against men that would improve them			0
' it ’s not as easy as all that			0
you run into arguments like would the best thing for @entity93 not playing for @entity156 be to go and play in the @entity3 third division or the @entity173 ? would that be the best way forward ? it ’s complicated			2
i ’m glad we ’re looking into it			0
but my head ’s a little bit full of the emotions about going home on wednesday which i ’m not looking forward to			0
