a lying @entity1 reviewer has been caught out by restaurant owners after they released surveillance footage showing he was in their restaurant for just 22 seconds			1
the user , known as @entity7			1
@entity8 , posted a scathing , one - star assessment of wonderful in @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity12 , claiming staff refused to seat him as he was alone , and even said they turned him down because of what he was wearing			1
owners of the venue saw the negative appraisal and decided to investigate			1
after looking over video captured at the restaurant 's front door , they discovered that the disgruntled customer did n't speak to a single member of staff and quickly left after looking at the waiting list			1
@entity8 after he wrote a one - star review of the venue			1
here he is entering the store at 19:07 in response they uploaded the damning video to their website and barred @entity7 from returning - saying that he will be ' arrested for trespassing ' if he comes back			1
the review was taken down by @entity1 following a request by the restaurant , but has since been re-published by @entity42			2
it read : ' my experience was at around 7 ; 30pm on a wednesday			2
i was flying solo that night , after a particularly challenging day			2
the waiter came up and asked how many [ sic ]			2
' i said one , i had planned to sit at the bar or get the food to go			2
she said ' one ? no , one ? ' and then ran off			0
i waited a minute at the door , and then left			0
they were busy and potentially understaffed			0
it 's not that classy of a place , but they refused to seat me			1
' sure , i was wearing jeans and a baseball cap with my flannel shift not tucked in			0
i had no intentions of taking a full table , just any corner i could fit in , or order off the menu to go once the guy next to me was done with it			0
' oh well , next time i go out in a group of three to six we 'll take our business elsewhere			0
fabrication : he claimed that staff refused to seat him			1
but the clip shows he does n't speak to anyone else and only peers into the seating area of the restaurant ' the key to a good business is to be consistent in the small things			1
that sucks , i just wanted food and i had cash , just as i sat down two people called me back and my entourage of 6 had an amazing dinner at @entity88 stick			0
' after his lie was uncovered , the restaurant posted a number of videos to their own website under the title : ' no the customer is not always right '			0
the accompanying message read : ' in this first video , you can see that you entered at 19:07 , which is earlier than you quoted			0
' you can also see that you did not wait a minute at the door			0
you spent a total of 22 seconds in the establishment			1
' this video also clearly shows that there were other patrons waiting			1
we are sincerely sorry that we forgot to recognize your very , very ' vip ' status at wonderful , a status so special that you do n't have to sign the waiting list like everyone else … i 've never been to a restaurant where to refuse to seat people because they 're wearing what you were wearing … you 're dreaming if you think that 's why you did n't get service			1
' you can clearly see @entity7 walk into the picture from the outside at 19:07:00 , and then he leaves the picture at 19:08:00			0
he does not communicate with any servers , and servers were cleaning tables to be able to serve the next customers in line on the waiting list posted at the door			0
' @entity7 , we did n't refuse to seat you			1
you refused to wait in line like everyone else			1
you thought you were special , so special that you do n't have to follow the rules			0
that 's not true , we caught you			0
' you are prohibited from returning to wonderful			1
if we catch you , you will be arrested for trespassing			1
' quick exit : just 22 seconds after walking into the restaurant , @entity7			2
he insists he is not the man in the video and has demanded that the restaurant take it down busy : another angle shows @entity7 surveying the seating area before deciding to leave			1
he claimed he was in the store for a minute @entity7			0
@entity8 then responded in another @entity1 review , claiming the man in the footage was not him and ordered it to be removed as he was being harassed online and it was ' damaging his reputation ' it read : ' aftermath : the owner put an inflammatory response with video of someone else claiming it was me			2
i also did not give you permission to put video of me on the internet			0
' after that people start harrasing [ sic ] me and threatening to tarnish my reputation online if i did not remove this review			0
' i 'd love a ceasefire , take down your bs and i 'll gladly take down this review ( which again is not fake )			0
that response and situation of only further shows you character			2
perhaps they cyberbully and threaten anyone who rates less than a 3 ? ' the restaurant responded again , saying : ' in the interest of being fair to what you said , i am posting video of our service from 18:45 to 19:30 on 18 march 2015			0
' if at any time you see yourself walk in and talk to the server , let me know , and i will gladly post a large banner that says ' i 'm sorry @entity7 for calling you a liar '			0
' otherwise , you must be hearing voices , because i sure do n't see you talking to anyone in the restaurant			2
' response : management at the venue have barred @entity7 from returning - saying that he will be ' arrested for trespassing ' if he comes back			1
