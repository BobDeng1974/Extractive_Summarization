uses beyond this are not known , and it is unclear whether hackers will be able to exploit it further to access personal information on the device			2
@entity65 posted a proof - of - concept video at the weekend that shows him hacking a device , unlocking it , changing the greeting message and remotely calling it			1
his hack is controlled using the web on a pc			0
there are three modes of attack seen in the video : remote mobile device lock , remote mobile device unlock , and remote device mobile ring			2
the flaw has also been reported by the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) in the @entity81 on its @entity83 ( @entity82 )			1
the security researchers have given it a high - severity rating of 7.8 , with an ‘ exploitability sub-score ’ of 10.0			1
this means it is a relatively easy hack and does n't require authentication			0
@entity80 ’s vulnerability report explained : ‘ the @entity93 feature on @entity1 mobile devices does not validate the source of lock - code data received over a network			1
' [ this ] makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service - screen locking with an arbitrary code - by triggering unexpected find my mobile network traffic			0
’ @entity9 researcher @entity65 has posted a proof - of - concept video ( screengrab pictured ) that shows him hacking a device , unlocking it , changing the greeting message and remotely calling it			1
the flaw has also been reported by the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) the flaw affects any @entity1 device with @entity6 enabled ( @entity113 pictured ) @entity1 told @entity114 : ' the reported issue occurred in web user interface , and it was fixed through a patch update on 13 october			1
' but mr @entity65 's proof - of - concept was posted on 27 october , after this patch date			1

it means hackers can remotely unlock devices and change pin codes
a proof - of - concept video also shows hackers remotely calling the device
@entity80 gave it ‘ high - severity ’ rating
@entity1 claims the reported issue was fixed on 13 october , but mr @entity65 's *demonstration* was posted since that date
@entity114 has contacted mr @entity65 to *confirm* if the flaw is still exploitable
