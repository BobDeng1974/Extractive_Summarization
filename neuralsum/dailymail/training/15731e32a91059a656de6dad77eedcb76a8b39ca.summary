' this is @entity46			1
we do n't have a problem with immigrants			2
when you explain that to them , they get it			0
not all of them – some people have prejudices , some people are frankly racist , but there are many who just do n't know the argument			2
' her comments carry echoes of the row during the last election , when former pm @entity78 was forced to apologise to @entity80 pensioner @entity79 after being caught on a microphone branding her a ' bigoted woman '			0
@entity3 supporters wave to drivers as they wait for leader @entity85 to arrive in @entity86 , @entity87 , last week ms @entity1 was forced to apologise to @entity85 for an attack on live tv @entity1 ’s intervention comes just months after she was forced to apologise to @entity85 for an attack on live tv			1

' just when you think a genuine , moderate debate about immigration is getting underway a @entity10 minister starts calling her own constituents racist			2
@entity3 mep @entity126 last night called miss @entity1 's remarks ' appallingly arrogant ' ' it is such a terrible , superior attitude to say to your own voters that if you do n't agree with me , you 're a racist			1
' @entity109 mp @entity143 said miss @entity1 was out of touch with voters ' concerns about immigration			1
the mp for @entity149 , @entity47 , said : ' the vast majority of people in @entity47 who raise concerns about immigration are neither racist nor bigoted			0
' their concern is about jobs , pay and pressure on public services			0
