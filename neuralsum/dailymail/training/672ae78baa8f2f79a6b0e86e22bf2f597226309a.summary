last week , @entity0 reported on the case of @entity2 - a 21 year - old woman who glassed her defenceless boyfriend in the face			1
ms @entity2 , a bar promoter from @entity5 - who was a contestant on @entity8 talent show @entity9 before being disqualified for her actions - launched the vicious attack on her boyfriend @entity12 after seeing a @entity14 message she simply ' disliked '			1
the assault , which took place in the victim 's @entity18 home , last summer , was so violent that it pierced an artery , scarring him for life – potentially destroying his burgeoning modelling career			2
anger : the attack took place after @entity2 came across a message on @entity14 that she did not like			1
the couple are pictured here during happier times it also caused severe blood loss and permanent nerve damage to his face			2
devastated mr @entity12 has described the incident as ‘ tragic ’ and ‘ life - changing from that moment on			1
’ at the hospital where he received treatment , @entity2 claimed @entity12 sustained his injuries from falling down the stairs , before changing her story and claiming it was an accident involving flying shards of glass			1
perhaps , given the opportunity , she also might 've claimed he walked into a door			2
tragic : @entity48 after being attacked by @entity2 after all , for all its subterfuge about television programmes , social networking sites and alcohol , this is nothing less than spousal abuse			1
a classic case of domestic violence made infinitely worse by the delusion that because it 's a female avenging a ( perceived ) broken heart caused by a man it 's ok			2
dangerously , this misnomer seems to be backed by both society and the law			0
last week , just like his girlfriend had done months earlier , the @entity67 legal system delivered @entity12 a cruel , underserving blow - this time , by letting his attacker escape jail			1
despite pleading guilty to unlawful wounding , thus qualifying for a five - year custodial sentence , @entity2 walked away with nothing more than a suspended sentence , a two - year supervision order and 120 hours of community service			1
musical : @entity2 is pictured left during an x factor rehearsal with @entity80 in a public message to all violent women , it implied that attacking men is girl power , not a criminal offence worthy of prison time - even when that means thrusting a wine glass into somebody 's face and throwing a laptop across a room			1
in a disturbing example of modern justice , @entity2 will now enjoy all the trappings of @entity97 without a shred of real , tangible punishment in sight			1
no wonder , along with the case of @entity103 - who walked free from court after punching a headmistress for reprimanding his unruly son - it sparked the @entity112 's what does it take to get jailed ? report , last week			1
quite frankly , both rulings are a joke			0
but , despite being equal understatements of justice , they differ on one crucial element - bias			0
while @entity122 was likely given leniency for having a dependent child , in my opinion , @entity2 got off ( from a much bloodier crime ) simply because she 's a woman			1
booted out : @entity2 , a bar promotion worker , was part of girl band @entity80 but the group was thrown off the @entity8 talent show when the attack came to light and it 's increasingly common			1
last month , @entity133 from @entity134 escaped jail - despite having a previous conviction for battery - after biting the tip off another club - goer ’s finger in a dance floor confrontation over ' stares '			0
similarly , on friday , @entity143 from @entity144 walked free from court after stabbing her boyfriend with a kitchen knife at their home			2
her punishment ? she was given a community order			0
earlier this year , @entity152 glassed a male clubber for simply smiling at her - but was spared jail by a judge			0
instead , she was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 400 compensation by judge @entity158 at @entity159			0
had these been cases of men attacking women , then - quite rightly - they would 've been given much stiffer penalties			0
but , in the same week where car insurance brokers are no longer able to discriminate against male drivers , the courts should be applying their policies equally , too			2
@entity169 mp has spoken out against pro-female discrimination endemic throughout @entity67 courts thankfully , i 'm not alone in my theory of equal equality - some people in power agree , too			0
last october , during a @entity178 debate on the topic of sentencing female offenders , @entity169 mp delivered an outstanding critique of the pro-female discrimination endemic throughout @entity67 courts			0
a transcript of the debate , which can be found online , is 14 pages long and ( as far as i 'm aware ) the only example of its kind in @entity67 politics			0
as we approach 2013 , we truly need more people like him - male and female - to speak up and defend fair justice if society is ever going to be equal for both men and women , boys and girls , victims and the vulnerable			0
part of this involves both victims and attackers realising that women are just as guilty as men			2
last week , newspapers reported on the case of @entity205 - a 43 - year - old from @entity207 who breached her @entity209 47 times in three months by verbally abusing her husband			2
the tirades were so loud and mentally torturous that they kept their neighbours awake at night			0
inappropriately , headlines described her as a ' nagging wife ' , when - in reality - she is an abusive one			0
like @entity2 , i doubt very much she even recognises this herself ( after all , no females commit domestic violence - right ? ) , but only stiffer legal sentences will change the world 's view on violent women			1
and their view of themselves			0
given that @entity2 's victim still claims to ' love ' his attacker ( evidence that men suffer the misleadingly - titled ' battered wife ' syndrome too ) , this needs to happen fast			1
certain newspapers and courts may treat female - on - male violence as a joke , but this is one issue which definitely has no room for a punchline .			0
