opposition leader @entity36 snubbed the idea of a coalition government insisting what @entity3 needs is ' immediate elections ' @entity29 , half way through his four - year term , has said he will step down after a power - sharing deal is reached			1
an agreement on who will lead the new government had been expected yesterday , but telephone negotiations between @entity29 and @entity36 had produced no public announcement by this morning			1
some officials said a result might come before a @entity76 meeting @entity29 was to chair at 12noon today			1
the wrangling comes amid intense pressure from @entity40			0

@entity3 has endured 20 months of punishing austerity measures in exchange for the international rescue loans			0
the efforts by @entity29 ’s government to keep the country solvent have prompted violent protests , crippling strikes and a sharp decline in living standards for most @entity3			1
the @entity8 has been accused of carrying out a coup d’etat in @entity3 , after the head of the @entity135 also threatened the country with ‘ paralysis ’ unless mps removed their prime minister			1
