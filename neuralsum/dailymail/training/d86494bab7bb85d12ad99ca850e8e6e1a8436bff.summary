residents in @entity7 , @entity17 , are outraged by @entity19 's plans to build 19 detached houses in the historic village			1
her ladyship has been accused of taking advantage of a change in planning laws that allow local authorities to regulate applications for new buildings			2
the family is well known in the village where former editor of the @entity33 , lord @entity31 was a @entity34			0
@entity1 is the mp for @entity17 , and lives in a neighbouring village			1
residents claim to have been on friendly terms with the family , but now say they are ' disappointed ' with the plans			1

' i think people are feeling very disappointed and let down by this , ' the 65 - year - old said			0
' it 's totally inappropriate and i 've never known them so upset about anything before			0
' even when the family moved they kept the @entity53 title and there was always this great closeness between the @entity56 and the people of @entity7			2
' consultants gave a lack of housing land as the reason behind a planning application for 19 detached homes shortly before @entity64			1
critics claim however the parish council has already found 15 individual , small building plots across the village which would be more suitable than an estate			0
' there is no question about it , they are taking advantage of a narrow window of opportunity , ' said mr @entity40			0
the family is well known in the village after the mp 's father ( left ) was named the baron of @entity7 in 1988 ' two years ago this application would have been laughed out because you 'd have had a ( hard ) job to put a garden gate or wooden shed up in this village			1
' it will be the same again when @entity86 gets its act together			0
' residents held the village 's first ever public meeting to discuss the matter , while some have sent letters of objection to the plans which ' will spoil a very sensitive part of the @entity17 countryside			1

' but her @entity106 might be in for a surprise			2
in the old days the @entity53 could do what he wanted , but the peasants are educated now and are in revolt			0
' though the land is not green belt , it is situated next to a nature conservation area and includes the @entity115 , a special landscape designation			0
her @entity118 's planning consultants told villagers that she will discuss financial contributions towards improvements to highways and education or broadband if she gets planning permission			2
local farmer @entity40 has said residents are disappointed with the plans which they feel could ruin the area 's landscape a local resident said : ' all planning is political and politically it would be convenient for @entity86 to grant permission for this development to help meet its housing targets , but for the residents of the village the application represents a money - making exercise by the owner of the land at the expense of the aspirations of others			1
' mr @entity1 said : ' planning is a matter for the local council and is not something that an mp has any say over			1
' however , the green belt is a national policy designation which i strongly support and would oppose developments that threaten it			0
