and that is exactly where a priceless porcelain vase remained for decades - until it sold for nearly £ 3 million			1
the mystery owner of the 16 - inch @entity12 artefact had no idea of its staggering value when she inherited it from a family member			1
instead she put flowers in it and placed it on a chest of drawers			2

@entity39 , an expert in @entity12 art at the auction house , said : the previous owners had inherited it and did n't really know a great deal about the vase other than that it was @entity12			2

' in fact , when we arrived at their house to have a look at it and a few other items it was sat on top of a cupboard with flowers in it			0
' when my colleague saw the vase and realised what it was he was taken aback			0
' for decades the £ 3m vase was filled with flowers on top of a chest of drawers , its huge value unknown the vase carries the mark of the @entity72 , who reigned from 1722 to 1735 at a landmark time for @entity12 art. for the first time designers could use enamel made in @entity12 rather than importing it from @entity78			1
