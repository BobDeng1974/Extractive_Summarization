@entity0 used to be the person everybody associated with @entity3 , according to the waitress setting down some glasses on our table			1
' now we have @entity10 , ' she exclaimed with a radiant smile			2
in @entity3 at the moment , people talk of little else			2
much maligned : a new visitor centre dedicated to @entity10 ( left ) , who died at the @entity15 in 1485 ( right ) has just opened in @entity3 - telling the full story of a king who history has painted as an evil tyrant the winter of this @entity22 's discontent has - literally - been made glorious summer by the bones of one man			1
' @entity10 ? he 's our @entity26 , ' said a @entity3 tourism executive			1
nearby @entity30 ( ' home of @entity26 ' ) has built a significant business on the back of the legendary ( as in ' probably fictitious ' ) medieval outlaw			0
but when a mechanical digger began carefully scratching down into the tarmac of a @entity3 municipal staff car park two years ago this month , few could have guessed the city was about to strike its own tourist gold			2
overview : the new @entity40 will assess @entity10 's legend in his final resting place , @entity3 a key piece of @entity45 's historic jigsaw : the @entity40 has cost £ 4million to put into operation a speculative archaeological dig had been authorised in order to explore the idea that beneath the car park lay the remains of the @entity52 in which it was long suspected @entity10 had been buried in 1485 following his defeat by @entity55 at the @entity15			1
@entity57 students at the @entity58 , whose archaeological department was in charge of the dig , estimated that the odds of locating @entity10 's remains were more than a million to one against			1
the odds against locating the @entity66 remains within the first two hours of the dig were probably a billion to one - but this is exactly what happened			0
the digger hit the archaeological bull 's - eye at the first attempt , although it took lengthy dna analysis to confirm the skeleton 's identity			1
remarkably , a historian was able to track down two of the @entity80 's direct descendants for the purpose of dna - matching , but experts suggest that probably 14 million of us are less directly related to @entity10			1
on the map : the visitor centre will allow @entity3 to steal some of @entity30 's thunder as a tourist city the confirmation of the discovery has fuelled about of @entity91 that few could have predicted			1
celebrations in the city move up a gear this week with the opening of the stunning new £ 4 million @entity10 visitor centre ( @entity97 ) situated in an old grammar school building adjacent to the famous car park			1
events reach a climax next spring ( the exact date has yet to be announced ) when the remains are ceremonially interred in a magnificent new tomb created at an estimated cost of £ 2.5million in @entity3 's cathedral , a stone 's throw from the burial site			1
the best way , it is said , to get your own back on your enemies is to outlive them			0
@entity10 may have died in 1485 , but his name has indelibly survived			2
by contrast , hardly anybody remembers his conqueror @entity55 , the first of the @entity121			0
@entity10 's name largely lingers because of the shakespeare play famously filmed in 1955 with @entity124 in the title role			1
a blast from the past : @entity10 's skeleton was unearthed below a car park in @entity3 early last year working under the tudor queen elizabeth i , the @entity130 served up a dramatic dish aimed at delighting his ruler ; the play presents @entity10 as the very devil whom @entity55 had every right to topple			1
this demonisation stimulated a growing campaign by present - day @entity138 - known as @entity140 - to set the record straight			0
it was leading @entity140 @entity143 who was the driving force behind the car park excavation two years ago			0
the new visitor centre wonderfully tells this whole story from medieval times up to the present			2
@entity26 certainly has nothing on this			0
even more surprising to visitors will be that @entity3 is one of @entity45 's loveliest historic cities , with a wealth of old buildings and lovely ancient streets			2
if you have school - age children whose curriculum includes the @entity121 , make a trip to @entity3 this summer a must			2
if @entity10 had beaten @entity55 on that august day , there would have been no @entity121 , no @entity165 , no protestant reformation , perhaps no loss of our extensive colonies in @entity169 - imagine if the @entity170 was still @entity171			2
grand arrival : @entity10 will be buried in @entity173 - where a plaque already remembers him - in 2015 part of the reason our world changed has lain undisturbed for more than 500 years on a patch of land that became the staff car park of @entity3 social services			1
you really could n't make it up			0
@entity40 ( www.kriii.com ) by lavish use of high - tech presentation and a 3d - printed copy of his skeleton , the excellent new centre provides brilliantly concise accounts of the rise and fall of @entity10 , his burial and his rediscovery in 2012			1
how did they know where to look ? how did they know it was him when the bones were discovered ? was @entity10 as bad as @entity130 suggested ? this will grab the attention of all visitors aged three to 103 , and is the perfect start to your @entity10 tour			1
@entity173 ( www.leicestercathedral.org ) very close to the visitor centre , this is where @entity10 's remains will be interred in a new tomb - expect a lavish , televised ceremony next spring			1
as cathedrals go , @entity3 's is modestly proportioned but very charming			2
@entity213 in 1880 , @entity214 made a famous painting of @entity10 on horseback outside @entity3 's @entity213 the day before the fatal battle			1
@entity10 is believed to have spent the night at the @entity213 in his own bed			2
on the site of the @entity213 now stands … a @entity219			0
@entity220 on his way to @entity15 , @entity10 passed over this bridge ' with great triumph and pomp '			0
after the battle , his body was brought back to the city over the same bridge , his naked corpse slung over a horse			0
it was subsequently claimed - falsely as we know now - that @entity10 's body was dug up from his grave and thrown in the river here			1
@entity236 there is little to be seen of the ancient @entity239 castle that would have been well known to @entity10 the @entity240 was used , until fairly recently , as the @entity241 where @entity243 author @entity242 was a frequent visitor as a court reporter			0
@entity245 this is the ancient and thoroughly delightful heart of old @entity3			0
it was in a church here that @entity10 's naked body was put on display - after being paraded through the streets			1
@entity52 spirited the body away for a hasty burial in their church			0
@entity255 ( www.doningtonleheath.com ) this exquisite 13th century property has what is claimed to be the very oak four - poster bed in which @entity10 slept before heading to @entity15			2
@entity10 had the habit of taking his own bed with him when he travelled , so one presumes this four - poster is an early example of flat - pack furniture			1
@entity15 ( www.bosworthbattlefield.com ) sixteen miles from @entity3 , @entity264 and @entity265 provides a wonderfully vivid account of the battle			0
the conflict was surprisingly quick - less than two hours			0
and casualties were relatively slight : about 1,000 people died during the fighting			0
handle the terrible weapons and learn how the fatal blow was delivered to @entity10 - there 's fun for all the family			1
@entity277 although hardcore ricardians the @entity278 fought a protracted legal action to have @entity10 buried at @entity281 , actually his links with @entity277 are slight			0
go , however , to look at the @entity284 's @entity10 window			2
and there are @entity55 and @entity286 run by the people who operate the @entity288			0
accommodation and restaurants turn your @entity10 trip into a glorious short break by staying at the excellent @entity294 ( www.staplefordpark.com ) , a @entity296 experience in wonderful countryside about 30 minutes ' drive from @entity3 near @entity299			1
a double room costs from £ 160 per night			0
great restaurants in the area include the @entity303 ( www.theredlioninn.co.uk ) in @entity304			0
in @entity307 itself , a short walk from the cathedral , is @entity309 ( www.thecase.co.uk )			0
for further information , go to visit @entity3 at www.visitleicester.info .			0
