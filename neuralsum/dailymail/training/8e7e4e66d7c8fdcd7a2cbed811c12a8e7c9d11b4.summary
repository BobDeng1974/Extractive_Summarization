the @entity0 is set to axe its @entity2 fleet after five decades of frontline service in special forces operations across the globe			0
after an outstanding record of service , the @entity6 has decided to retire the ageing @entity2 and replace them with hi - tech vehicles which can offer better protection to soldiers			1
it comes as @entity2 prepares to end production of the defender model - on which military vehicles are based - after 67 years			1
its planned replacement is yet to be launched			2
the @entity0 is to axe its fleet of @entity2 after using the vehicles on the frontline for five decades land rovers were used and much - loved by sir @entity23 and for many years the @entity24 - who also drives them - stood in a military @entity2 when she inspected troops at ceremonial events			1
adapted military @entity2 were used by the @entity0 to help target scud missiles during the @entity30 war and heavily armed versions of the vehicle were used to hunt @entity34 insurgents in @entity35			2
now military procurement chiefs at the @entity38 ’s @entity37 are to issue a tender for a replacement , which is expected to be based on the current @entity42 vehicle - used in @entity35			1
since it was first introduced the military have purchased almost 200,000 variants of the @entity46 built @entity2 with the most famous being those used by the @entity0 in the desert			2
they were nicknamed ‘ pinkies ’ after their painted camouflage colour designed to blend with the dunes			0
@entity24 - who drives a @entity2 - has often stood in them while she inspects troops , as here in 1951 @entity23 was also fond of the vehicles and is seen here with a @entity56 the @entity2 has been sold to armies across the world with the @entity60 and @entity61 special forces buying ‘ unique variants ’ for front line operations			1
across the @entity6 , land rovers have been used in @entity65 , at @entity66 and @entity67 while in @entity68 they became they spearheaded the internal security operation on the streets			1
the @entity72 mounted anti-tank guns on them , the artillery used a tracked version and during the @entity76 they were airlifted by helicopter into the desert			0
but while the reliability of the @entity2 was never questioned , the reputation of the vehicle was tarnished when military bosses deployed so - called ‘ snatch ’ versions to southern @entity30			1
these had been used as riot vehicles in @entity68			1
but the @entity85 provided little protection against improvised roadside bombs and after a series of fatalities was quickly dubbed the ‘ coffin ’ by soldiers			1
it is said the so - called ' snatch ' version of the vehicles offered little protection against roadside bombs in @entity30 a senior @entity6 source said the @entity2 had served the military well , but after almost 50 years of service it was time for a change and a vehicle that was more relevant for today ’s battlefield			1
he added : ‘ @entity104 has been the work horse of @entity46 armed forces , but i suspect @entity35 will be its last operational deployment ’			0
the last of the current civilian @entity108 will roll - off the production lines of @entity112 ’s ( @entity112 ) @entity111 factory in the @entity113 in december 2015			2
the original defender workhorse off - roader began life in 1948 as a £ 450 agricultural aid for farmers			0
astonishingly , some three - quarters of the 2 million defenders ever built since then are still in regular use			0
military procurement chiefs are to issue a tender for a replacement , which is expected to be based on the @entity42 vehicle ( pictured ) @entity2 holds a royal warrant , as supplier to the royal household			2
the royal relationship with @entity2 also goes back to 1948 when @entity130 viewed the original @entity2			0
the @entity24 used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953 , @entity23 was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in @entity136 , while another was used for @entity139 ’s tour of @entity140 in 1982			2
and shortly after ending his love affair with young @entity142 in the 1950s , former battle of britain pilot group captain @entity144 set off on a 57,000 mile journey around the world in his short @entity147 which he completed in 1957 and chronicled in his book ‘ @entity149 , my friend			0
’ @entity2 said last night : ‘ current defender production will end , due to legislation , mid-decade			0
‘ as a business , we are currently reviewing our options based on the clear company brand vision to develop three product pillars of @entity159			0
we have stated our intention to replace defender but have nothing to add at this time			0

long - serving vehicles are to be retired after half a *century* of use
saw action in conflicts in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity68
replacement will offer better protection against roadside bombs
