@entity1 's lawyers have launched a bid to prevent prosecutors appealing his manslaughter conviction ahead of a a possible new murder trial over the death of @entity7			1
lawyers for the jailed @entity9 said yesterday they have launched a legal bid to prevent prosecutors from appealing against his acquittal on murder charges			1
prosecutors want @entity1 , 28 , convicted of the more serious crime of murder for shooting girlfriend @entity7 in 2013 - and in december they were granted permission by judge @entity19 to appeal against his acquittal			1
in @entity36 applies if the accused knew they might kill someone but still went ahead with their course of action			0
@entity1 was instead convicted of culpable homicide , or manslaughter , and sentenced to five years in prison prosecutors argue that judge @entity19 misinterpreted the law when she cleared @entity1 of murder on the basis that he did not intentionally shoot ms @entity7			1
but now defence lawyers are challenging the judge 's decision to allow prosecutors to appeal as they do not want the culpable homicide verdict to be overturned @entity1 and model @entity7 in 2012 - he fatally shot her on @entity57 2013 at his home @entity1 lawyers ' said in a brief statement yesterday that they have applied to argue against allowing prosecutors to appeal			1
their application will be heard in court on march 13			0
@entity1 's legal team say his conviction was based on facts presented during the trial , not on an interpretation of law , and therefore can not be appealed			2
' we will argue that these are matters of fact , rather than matters of law , ' they said in a statement			0
judge @entity19 presided over @entity1 ' seven - month murder trial last year and heard how hr shot @entity7 multiple times through a closed toilet door in his home in @entity82 on @entity57			1
she ruled @entity1 , known as the ' @entity1 ' for his prosthetic legs he wears on the track , did not intend to kill @entity7 and acquitted him of murder , but found he acted negligently when he fired four times through the door from close range with his 9 mm pistol			2
during the trial , @entity1 testified that he shot the model four times through a locked toilet door , believing she was an intruder			0
@entity94 2 @entity93 where @entity1 is serving his five - year sentence in @entity82 prosecutors argued he deliberately killed the 29 - year - old law graduate after an argument , but judge @entity19 ruled they had failed to prove intent			1
if the @entity100 finds that @entity1 should have been found guilty of murder , as prosecutors contend , he faces a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison			2
but the challenge by his lawyers to the appeal is likely to delay the process			0
@entity1 's trial last year attracted massive international interest and revealed a darker side to the once - revered athlete			0
he is currently serving his prison term in the hospital ward of a @entity82 prison , away from the often overcrowded cells of @entity118 's jails , which are notorious for gang violence			0
he could be eligible to be moved to house arrest in august , when he may be able to serve the remainder of his sentence at his uncle 's home .			0

prosecutors want to appeal @entity1 's manslaughter conviction
he was sentenced to five years in prison for killing girlfriend @entity7 in 2013
he was acquitted of both premeditated murder and common - law murder
prosecutors say judge misinterpreted law when she cleared him of murder
judge @entity19 ruled prosecutors could appeal against acquittal
now defence lawyers have launched bid to prevent the appeal going ahead
