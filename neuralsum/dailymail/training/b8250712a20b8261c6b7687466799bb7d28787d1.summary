by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 18:27 est , 15 january 2014 pubs and nightclubs routinely break a law which says they should refuse to serve people who are already drunk , research has claimed			1
actors staggered to the bar at more than 70 pubs , bars and nightclubs in one northern @entity13 city and ordered a vodka and coke in a ' loud , slurred ' voice			1
some 84 per cent of the time they were served - with the success rate rising to 94 per cent on friday nights and 96 per cent after midnight			1
had a few too many ? just a sixth of actors pretending to be drunk were turned away by bar staff ( stock photo ) a study said the actors were often served even though bartenders recognised they were drunk - by remarking on it to colleagues or rolling their eyes			1
campaigners say preventing sales of alcohol to already drunk people would protect long - term health and reduce the strain on the @entity38			2
the study was carried out by a team at the @entity40 at @entity42 @entity41			0
four student actors aged 20 to 22 - two male and two female - were recruited through auditions and taught how to act drunk			2
their impersonation included slurred speech , being unsteady on their feet and having difficulty focusing and was tested on police			0
in each attempt to buy alcohol , one actor pretended to be drunk while a second actor took on the role of sober friend			0
binge : despite the actors staggering and slurring words , a fifth were asked if they wanted a double shot the ' drunk ' actor stumbled to the bar and used ' loud , slurred speech ' to ask the price of a vodka and coke , before fumbling over their purse or wallet as they bought the drink			1
the attempts - made from wednesday to sunday evenings between 9pm and 3am - were successful at least 60 per cent of the time on every night			0
the hit rate was the lowest on wednesdays when the actors were refused service two out of every five times			0
before midnight , the actors would be served on average 78 per cent of the time , but this rose to 96 per cent after midnight			1
in almost one in five sales ( 18 per cent ) , bar staff even tried to sell the candidates more alcohol - by suggesting they ' double up ' their vodka and coke			1
overall , 73 randomly - selected pubs , bars and clubs were tested in an unnamed city in the north west of @entity13			1
the study 's authors said : ' @entity94 law preventing sales of alcohol to drunks is routinely broken in nightlife environments , yet prosecutions are rare ( three in 2010 )			1
' nightlife drunkenness places enormous burdens on health and health services			0
lax : it is illegal to serve alcohol to people who are already drunk - or try to buy it for them - under the @entity109 , but just three people were prosecuted in 2010			1
pictured : file image of women on a night out ' preventing alcohol sales to drunks should be a public health priority , while policy failures on issues , such as alcohol pricing , are revisited			0
' the @entity119 makes it illegal to sell alcohol to someone who is drunk , or even to try and buy it on their behalf			0
in theory offenders can be fined Â £ 1,000 , but prosecutions are almost unheard of			0
the study found venues with ' indicators of poor management ' - such as cheap alcohol promotions , young bar workers , young clientele , crowds , poor lighting , rowdiness , dirtiness and high levels of drunkenness - were most likely to serve the fake drunks			2
the actors were almost always successful in venues which had bouncers ( 95 per cent of the time ) , compared to a two - thirds success rate in those without			2
the authors added : ' although our study focused on one city , a lack of prosecution for sales to drunks throughout @entity13 suggests this is typical of nightlife environments nationally			2
' with policies to prevent alcohol - related harm by increasing alcohol prices failing to be implemented , increased use of legislation preventing sales of alcohol to drunks should be considered a public health priority			0
' the study was published in the @entity167 .			0

study sent actors to 73 pubs , bars and clubs in the north west of @entity13
they were almost always served despite slurring words and staggering
18 per cent of bar staff even asked actors if they wanted a double shot
just three people were prosecuted over the little - enforced law in 2010
