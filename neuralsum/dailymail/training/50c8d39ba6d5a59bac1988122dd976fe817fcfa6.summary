‘ i screamed at them “ swim ”			0
@entity0 was seriously panicking , he was disappearing under the waves and shouting that he could n’t breathe			1
‘ i got hold of him , two or three times , but a big wave bashed us against the rocks			2
‘ i turned to try and find @entity43 , i was fighting against the waves and i lost him at that point			0
i was being knocked on to the rocks and back into the water and was screaming “ @entity43 , @entity43 ” , but i could n’t see him and got no response			2
