by @entity0 prince @entity1 in @entity2 in 2012 : the @entity3 - the prince 's unit - is embarking on a final @entity2 tour under strength prince @entity1 could be asked to return to frontline duty in @entity2 due to a shortage of crew to fly @entity12 helicopters , according to @entity14 sources			1
the @entity3 ( @entity4 ) – the regiment @entity1 joined from the @entity15 to fly @entity16 – is embarking on a final tour of @entity2 as the @entity4 faces a 40 per cent shortage of senior air crew			1
defence sources say @entity1 , 29 , has volunteered to fly again should 3 @entity4 be in danger of going to war under - strength			1
the @entity24 refused to comment but a source close to @entity1 denied this was the case			1
the prince , who started a desk job in @entity29 in january arranging ceremonial events , remains qualified as an @entity12 pilot , having flown sorties against the @entity33 in 2012 - 2013			2
he would need only to attend a brief refresher course before being sent back to @entity35 for a 12 - week stint			2
meanwhile , other shortages in the @entity38 have triggered a rise in ‘ @entity43 ’ one - off payments for personnel to stay in service			0
on top of their salaries , military nurses are being offered £ 20,000 and weapons engineers aboard submarines £ 50,000 to sign - on for an extra five years			2
this rise comes as a report by the @entity50 found that some privates in the @entity53 fighting in @entity2 are earning less than the @entity54 ( @entity54 )			1
troops ’ pay starts at £ 17,767 a year and long working hours means they may earn less than the £ 6.31 an hour @entity54 for those over 21 and £ 5.03 an hour for those over 18			0
the report says : ‘ it is possible for those on the lowest pay level to be earning below @entity54 levels if they work over 55 hours per week , for those aged 21 or over , or more than 68 hours per week if they are aged between 18 and 20			0
' as the average number of hours worked is much higher for those personnel on overseas operations or at sea , the more time someone spends in these locations the greater the chance of breaching @entity54 thresholds			0
’ crucial tool : an @entity12 helicopter on a rescue mission in @entity2			1
@entity1 remains qualified as an @entity12 pilot			2
he would need only a brief refresher course before being sent back to @entity35 for a 12 - week stint an @entity82 spokesman said : ‘ we have worked hard to ensure that the sacrifices and dedication of our personnel is recognised , which is why they have continued to receive pay rises and also qualify for other benefits including subsidised accommodation , generous non-contributory pensions and substantial periods of paid leave			0
' it is therefore entirely misleading to suggest that personnel earn less than the minimum wage			0
on the @entity43 payments , he added : ‘ as is common practice among commercial organisations , we use financial retention incentives to ensure we retain essential skills and experience within the @entity38			0
