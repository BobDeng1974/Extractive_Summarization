@entity0 is praying for a glamour tie in the last 32 of the @entity2 that will bring the thunder back to @entity4			1
a thumping 4 - 1 win over managerless @entity6 increased the gap at the top of the @entity10 to six points and teed up monday ’s draw in @entity13			1
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and old foes @entity17 are just four of the teams the @entity21 champions could face			1
@entity22 boss @entity0 is praying for a glamour tie in the last 32 of the @entity2 with large gaps in the @entity4 stands now a feature at home games , @entity0 wants the kind of name which could bring the missing fans back and pack the stadium to the rafters			1
‘ it ’s going to be a hard draw whoever we get , ’ said the @entity32			2
‘ we ’re going to meet a good club			2
‘ we want a good draw so we can fill the stadium and get 60,000 here - which is the atmosphere we want			2
everybody is beatable but some are harder than others			2
’ @entity22 ’s reinstatement to the @entity44 sparked a row with @entity17 in the summer and , following a 6 - 1 aggregate defeat , @entity0 admitted he would rather avoid the @entity47			1
@entity22 could face @entity47 side @entity17 , who have beaten them already this season ‘ would i like @entity17 ? they ’re a good team of course and it would be a special team if we got them			1
hopefully we will get something else - but our players will be up for the game whoever we get			2
’ two goals from @entity56 and one apiece from @entity57 – his first of the season – and @entity59 eased @entity22 past @entity6			1
@entity56 missed the @entity17 double header with an early season injury , but has no preferences ahead of the draw			1
@entity56 ( left ) celebrates his opening strike against @entity6 as @entity22 moved six points clear ‘ i do n’t think it really matters – we will happily take on anybody , ’ he said			1
‘ if it ’s at @entity4 , whoever we get it ’s a great atmosphere and a great occasion for us			0
’ @entity6 equalised through full - back @entity72 and made early chances , but had keeper @entity75 to thank for keeping the score down after the home side blew a raft of chances			1
‘ it was a slow start from us , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but we improved towards the end of the first half			2
we kept possession , created chances and scored three good goals			0
‘ we moved the ball very quickly which was good			0
we then created a lot of chances in the second half and got to 4 - 1			1
after that we controlled the game			0
‘ overall it ’s a good win , an important win			0
that ’s us six points ahead so i ’m very satisfied			0
@entity72 equalised for @entity6 but @entity57 ( above ) restored @entity22 's lead in the 15th minute ‘ we are creating chances and that ’s the positive thing			1
but again , i was thinking : “ is it enough ? should we be scoring more goals ? ” ‘ that is something we have to work on if we are going to improve			0
we need to be more clinical			0
’ @entity0 played down fresh fears over @entity57 , removed at half - time , by explaining the winger had a migraine			1
however , @entity102 took a kick which forced his removal after 55 minutes and the @entity105 faces tests on monday morning			0
‘ hopefully he ’s going to be okay , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ the medical people checked him and said they think it ’s just a kick , but you never know with these things			0
’ @entity22 – watched by former idol @entity111 - are now easing towards a fourth successive title and @entity56 believes they will take some stopping			1
@entity59 ( centre ) caps off a dominant display for the home side with his 67th minute strike ‘ it has taken time , but we are starting to find our form			0
on this form it will be hard for teams to catch us			0
‘ if we keep going and creating the chances and scoring the goals we are going to be hard to beat			2
‘ @entity127 is always different and it ’s hard for us there			0
everyone knows the teams we can get , it ’s going to be difficult no matter where we go			0
‘ the @entity132 is the one for us and we need to concentrate more than anything on that – to retain that title again			0
