@entity0 has taken her love of emojis to another level by opting to answer a question from today 's @entity5 by morphing her face into one of the characters			1
the foreign minister was asked if she knew what a @entity10 was after several senators were left confused on tuesday when the $ 2,000 cooking appliance appeared on a list of items the governor general was after for his two residences			1
' this is how it was discussed in @entity22 estimates yesterday ... they said they did n't know what a @entity24 is			2
@entity0 , do you know what a @entity24 is ? ' @entity5 asked			2
ms @entity0 responded : ' i 'm going to answer in emoji ' as she raised her eyebrows and stared wide - eyed into the camera			1
' that 's why you rock , @entity0 , ' @entity5 said as he laughed hysterically			0
her response comes after the multi-talented kitchen appliance sparked debate in a @entity22 hearing on tuesday when @entity47 senator @entity46 read through a list of kitchen appliances put forward by governor general sir @entity50			1
' you 're seeking four stick blenders , two food processors ... and you 're going to have to help me with this - a @entity24 ? ' he said			0
' i do n't know what a @entity24 is			0
' the governor general 's list of appliances , estimated to be worth between $ 80,000 - $ 100,000 , are for his two residences - @entity61 in @entity62 and @entity63 in @entity64			1
committee chair and @entity67 senator @entity65 ridiculed mr @entity46 , asking : ' where have you been ? ' ms @entity0 responded to @entity5 's ( right ) question by mimicking the emoji face ( left ) as she raised her eyebrows and stared wide - eyed into the camera the @entity75 - designed ' twelve appliances in one ' device has an almost cult - like following with thousands of loyal users around the world			1
' @entity81 , ' @entity80 responded			0
' a kitchen aid mixer , an upright freezer , a deep fryer and a pasta machine			0
and what 's a @entity10 ? , ' he continued			0
the governor general 's official secretary , @entity88 , confessed : ' i do n't know what a @entity24 is			1
' ' so there are a couple of us who do n't know what a @entity24 is , ' @entity80 announced			0
attempting to fill the @entity22 's @entity97 in on the almost $ 2,000 kitchen toy , senator @entity65 explained : ' they 're very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today			1
' they can not be bought in stores and shoppers hold ' @entity24 parties ' similar to @entity106 parties where a consultant comes out to a customer 's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends			0
there are more than 3,000 @entity24 consultants across @entity115			0
' is that the elite trendies that use that , are they ? ' asked @entity80			0
the governor general 's office has requested a @entity24 but the governor general 's official secretary @entity88 ( left ) was forced to confess to @entity47 senator @entity46 ( right ) he did n't know what it is the governor general 's ( pictured ) office put out a tender for $ 80,000 - $ 100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment ' in @entity81 , you may refer to them as that , i just refer to them as those who have a particular interest in cooking , ' senator @entity65 retorted			1
noticing he 'd touched a nerve , senator @entity46 probed : ' is that the new model or the old model ? ' ' i 'm no @entity139 myself all i know is that my team and with the expert advice of kitchen consultants have given us advice on the sorts of things our kitchen requires in order for it to function properly ' mr @entity88 said			1
senator @entity46 then took the opportunity to point out how much the governor general 's office is spending elsewhere			1
' you have $ 168,000 spent on redundancies , one involuntary , you have a request for a speechwriter and a media advisor â€¦ the previous governor general managed not to require them			2
' and now you have a couple hundred thousand spent on that amount , plus an additional amount on kitchen appliances			2
you wonder where the priorities are , ' he said			0
but mr @entity88 reasoned that they need the new kitchen appliances to maintain the ' heritage properties '			2
' we 're seeking to do so in the most efficient manner possible hence we 're seeking to replace 14 kitchen items , ' he said			0
the @entity75 - designed ' twelve appliances in one ' device called a @entity24 has an almost cult - like following south @entity67 senator @entity65 described the @entity24 as ' very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today '			2
