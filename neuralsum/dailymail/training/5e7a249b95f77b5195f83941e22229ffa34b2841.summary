a puppy born with deformities in both his front legs has found a new lease of life after being fitted with specially designed 3d - printed prosthetics			1
when @entity10 was born in august 2013 , his original owners in @entity9 had considered sending him to a shelter to be euthanized			2
instead he was taken in by @entity12 , a non-profit dog shelter with a no kill policy in @entity15			0
@entity10 was fitted with a cart that allowed him to move with some mobility , but @entity39 told @entity40 that she wanted to see if she could print prosthetic legs to allow the high - energy dog to run and play more freely			1
with the help of her colleagues at @entity26 , she began designing and testing prosthetics for @entity10			0
a cat scan was taken of his front legs which provided the data needed to turn thousands of layers of @entity52 photos of @entity10 ’s limbs into the 3d geometry that would then be printed			1
by june , @entity10 had been adopted by @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity39 regularly visited them to test out different designs for @entity10 's new legs			0
after several experiments , @entity39 settled on a design called ‘ elbow cups ’ and in november @entity10 tried his new limbs for the first time his new limbs allow @entity10 the freedom and mobility to be able to play with other dogs @entity10 was fitted with a cart that allowed him to move with some mobility , but @entity39 wanted to see if she could print prosthetic legs to allow the high - energy dog to run and play more freely a process called @entity73 printing allowed @entity26 to produce a prosthetic containing both the rigid and flexible materials needs to provide @entity10 with some comfortable to wear but durable enough to withstand his weight			1
after several experiments , @entity39 settled on a design called ‘ elbow cups ’ and in november @entity10 tried his new limbs for the first time			1
@entity10 took to his new prosthetics immediately and he now wears them every day to run two to three miles with his owners			2
' the first time he was put on the prosthetics and he took of running he was just so happy			0
i was absolutely amazed , ' said @entity31			0
@entity39 now hopes the technology can be used to help other dogs who have either had accidents or were born with deformities .			0

@entity10 was born with deformed front legs and was almost sent to be euthanized
instead he was fostered by @entity25 who works for a 3d printing company
she set about designing prosthetic legs that would allow the high - energy dog to run and play more freely
@entity10 now wears her ' elbow cups ' design to run 2 or 3 miles every day
