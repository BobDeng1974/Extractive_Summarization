by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 14:30 est , 12 december 2013 an aircraft fleet owned by @entity3 's founders and former ceo received improper discounts on jet fuel that saved the three billionaires up to $ 5.3 million dating back to depths of the @entity9 in 2009 , according to a government report released yesterday			1
the findings by @entity13 's inspector general surfaced during a review of a government airfield lease for seven planes and two helicopters controlled by @entity3 's founders , @entity19 and @entity20 , and the internet search company 's former ceo , @entity21			1
the aircraft are managed through a company called @entity25 set up by the three men through the tremendous wealth that they have accumulated as @entity3 's stock price has soared from $ 85 in 2004 to nearly $ 1,100			1
billionaire business men : @entity3 's former ceo @entity21 ( left ) is worth about $ 8 billion and @entity3 founder @entity20 ( right ) is worth about $ 25 billion page , who is @entity3 's current ceo , and @entity20 , who heads the company 's special projects division , are each worth about $ 25 billion , according to @entity34			1
@entity21 , who became executive chairman after stepping down as ceo in 2011 , is worth about $ 8 billion			1
@entity25 has been paying $ 1.4 million annually since 2007 to lease hangar space from @entity13 at @entity37 , a former @entity39 base 4 miles from @entity3 's @entity40 , @entity41 , headquarters			2
@entity13 's inspector general concluded that the rent for the hangar space represented a fair rate , but the inspector general 's report flagged the bargain that @entity3 's jet - setting executives got on the fuel for their flights around the world			1
the @entity25 aircraft saved somewhere from $ 3.3 million to $ 5.3 million beginning in 2009 by buying fuel through an arm of the @entity56 @entity55 at below - market prices that allowed them to avoid state and local taxes , according to the report			1
@entity3 founder @entity19 is worth about $ 25 billion the discounts did n't result in any losses for @entity13 or the @entity55 , the report said , but probably deprived the state of @entity41 and local government agencies of tax revenue			1
other fuel suppliers probably missed out on an opportunity to make money had @entity25 not worked out the special arrangement with the government			2
the inspector general recommended that @entity13 and @entity25 discuss possible ways to address a situation that ' engendered a sense of unfairness and a perception of favoritism			0
' @entity25 spokesman @entity79 said the company was reviewing the audit 's findings			0
the report said the improper fuel discounts stopped in september after questions were raised about the bargain prices			1
the discounts given to @entity25 stemmed from a ' misunderstanding ' about the relationship between @entity13 and the aircraft used by the @entity3 executives , according to the inspector general			2
as part of its lease , @entity25 agreed that its planes would carry instruments to collect climate data for @entity13 at no cost to the space agency			2
the planes doing work for @entity13 qualified for the discounts , the report said			2
but the jet fuel was also sold to the @entity25 planes even when the @entity3 executives were using the aircraft for recreation and other business with no benefit to @entity13			1
a snapshot of flight activity taken between august 2012 and july of this year found nearly three - fourths of the @entity25 excursions of out @entity37 had no connection to @entity13			0
of the 229 total flights during that time , 59 involved a @entity13 science mission and most of them were handled by an @entity119 that the @entity3 executives obtained to fulfill their obligations to the space agency			0
@entity25 also owns or leases six @entity123 or @entity124 planes			0
racking up the air miles : @entity3 owns several aircraft , including this @entity128 private jet since the @entity13 lease began , @entity25 has flown more than 200 science flights for the space agency			1
the inspector general calculated that @entity13 would have had to pay $ 668,000 if it had been billed for the @entity25 flights taken from september 2010 through july of this year			0
despite that benefit , a consumer group frequently critical of @entity3 blasted the airfield lease as a ' sweetheart deal ' for some of the world 's richest people at time when millions of other people are struggling to make ends meet in a still - fragile economy			0
' we think it 's pretty outrageous , ' said @entity147 of @entity148			0
' basically , it 's just another example of preferential treatment for the @entity3 guys			0
' @entity25 's lease at @entity154 expires in july			0
the @entity3 executives are working with a private contractor to build another space for their planes at the @entity158 located about 10 miles from @entity37			0
@entity3 logo is displayed on the company 's headquarters in @entity162 , @entity163			0

@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 saved up to $ 5.3m on jet fuel dating back to the 2009 *recession*
