@entity1 was perhaps the only happy @entity2 at @entity3 on saturday night and , after leading @entity4 a merry dance , he revealed faint but lingering @entity6 hopes			1
@entity9 ’s former @entity8 full back ran amok as the @entity11 champions were thrashed 37 - 5 — scoring one try from long range and having a crucial hand in two others , to claim the man - of - the - match award			1
@entity1 won the last of his two caps for @entity23 back in 2007 , but he was still on the coaches ’ radar until his move across the @entity18 last summer and , after a supreme display of elusive running , he admitted he has not given up on the slim possibility of a test recall			2
@entity1 breaks clear to score for @entity9 in their thrashing of @entity4 on saturday the @entity2 full back was man of the match for the third time against @entity11 opposition this year the 28 - year - old is theoretically out of contention as an exile abroad , but he invoked the ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ clause in the @entity39 selection policy as he said : ‘ i ’d love to get a call from @entity41 ( @entity42 ) over the summer , but i ’m not counting on it because they ’ve got that rule in place			1
‘ i understood the reasons for the rule , and in my heart i knew that when i came to @entity50 my @entity23 career was probably over			1
if @entity9 continue the way they are , i stay injury - free and i keep playing some good rugby , then maybe it ’s a possibility in the same way that people have been talking about @entity58 ( @entity59 )			2
’ @entity1 crosses in his starring performance for the @entity50 side in the @entity62 a @entity6 dispensation has been discussed for @entity64 's @entity2 flanker @entity59 they have the squad to do anything , based on their efforts on saturday night , when the @entity69 were brutally swept aside			1
visiting captain @entity70 said : ‘ they steamrollered us and just kept going			0
’ his fellow @entity23 forward , @entity73 , vented his frustration on @entity76 , saying : ‘ thanks to @entity9 for inviting us to their open training - session today			0
we ’ve left our non-contact bibs in the changing - rooms			0
’ @entity4 captain @entity70 ( second right ) leads the @entity69 off the field after their convincing defeat meanwhile @entity85 believes it is only a matter of time before @entity8 ’s attacking intent delivers silverware after their 18 - 15 @entity62 quarter - final loss to @entity90 in @entity91			2
@entity93 ’s men produced an impressive second - half comeback to leave the three - time champions hanging on by a thread at the end with full back @entity85 and fly - half @entity99 especially impressive			0
‘ if anything , the way we played against @entity90 adds more confidence because i thought there were times when we showed all we can do , ’ @entity85 said			0
‘ i think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of and i have really enjoyed playing for this club			0
