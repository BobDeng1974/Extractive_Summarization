it is a bloom that has not been seen in @entity1 by the public for more than 100 years			2
but the sight of a rare white helliborine orchid is one the @entity5 is able to enjoy - as it is growing in her gardens at @entity7			1
and walking through the 40 acres of land that make up her green oasis , there are countless trees covered in plaques to show they have been planted by kings , queens , emperors , princes and princesses			1
the queen , pictured with the @entity21 at one of @entity7 's summer garden parties , has given @entity24 unprecedented access to the 40 acres of land regarded as the @entity5 's private sanctuary where she is able to relax , and enjoy walking her corgis , the doors have finally been opened to the public through a special two part documentary which will be shown later this month on @entity24			1
the palace grounds are only partially opened for the @entity5 's annual summer garden parties which host up to 7,000 guests			2
however for the purposes of the programme , titled @entity38 , the film crew was given unprecedented access and the cameras are believed to have captured the resident urban foxes , and the @entity5 's 200,000 honey bees			1
housed in four hives on a secluded island in the garden 's lake to produce honey for the royal family			2
the programme is presented by gardening expert @entity49 who was thrilled to stumble upon the white helliborine			0
he said : ' this little white flower			0
it may not seem terribly spectacular but it 's the sign of something very exciting			0
it was found growing here a year ago and before that it had n't been discovered in @entity1 for over a century			0
the garden 's 40 acres is enough for 22 football pitches and during her reign her majesty has ensured her grounds are a place where nature thrives ' the helliborine orchid , normally a native of chalk woodland , miles away from here , it 's a sign that this is one of the richest environments for hundreds of square miles around			1
' the garden 's 40 acres is enough for 22 football pitches and during her reign her majesty has ensured her grounds are a place where nature thrives			1
it now plays host to 350 species of wildflower , 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand @entity85 species of insect , including butterflies			1
the @entity5 's head chef also uses mulberries from the 50 mulberry trees in the garden , which were planted by @entity92 @entity95 , hazel catkins and winter jasmine currently fill the beds of the gardens at @entity7 , speaking to the @entity98 , mr @entity49 said : ' if you wander off into the undergrowth , you 'll find what is probably one of the finest collections of trees and shrubs in the country , including 35 different types of mulberry			2
the sight of a rare white helliborine orchid is one the @entity5 is able to enjoy - as it is growing in her gardens at @entity7 but it 's a revelation to see just see how much wildlife there is – amazing bird and insect life and mammals – which for somewhere slap - bang in the middle of the city is unusual			1
' i went every month for a year and saw it right the way through the seasons			0
it 's size , scale and scope is much larger than ever you 'd imagine – it really is a green lung and oasis in the middle of the city			0
' equipment set up in a similar way to the @entity135 's popular @entity134 programme – nest - box , infra - red and motion - activated cameras , will reveal the types of wild flowers that bloom to fill the @entity5 's garden with colour and show how 50 species of bird , including kingfishers and woodcock , visit throughout the year			1
the @entity5 has a team of gardeners who ensure the grounds are beautifully maintained , and each monday she is presented with a posy of what is growing			0
explains mr @entity49 : ' the gardeners are quite cagey talking about what the @entity5 likes , but what becomes quite evident is she loves what we would call @entity158 cottage garden flowers – unostentatious flowers , not things that are too exotic			0
the programme is presented by gardening expert @entity49 who was thrilled to stumble upon the rare white helliborine orchid ' she has a little posy cut for her every monday , which is placed on her desk for when she arrives back from @entity166			1
it will typically have six or seven different types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of what 's looking good at that time			2
' @entity49 added that the @entity5 is ' very much involved with major changes ' , saying : ' the summer garden parties were always in july , but now they have been moved slightly earlier to june that means adjusting the planting scheme to make the borders brighter earlier			0
' she would be consulted about that sort of thing			0
