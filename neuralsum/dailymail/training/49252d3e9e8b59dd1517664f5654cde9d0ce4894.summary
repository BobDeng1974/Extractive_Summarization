@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest instalment of his column for @entity4			1
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on what might have been after he thought he had landed the @entity12 job and @entity14 's maverick forward @entity13			1
i thought my @entity17 call had arrived my old chairman at @entity20 was that former top @entity21 boss , @entity19			1
he was always nice to me and looked after me well and just let me get on with managing the team without any interference or any comment whether we won , lost or drew			2
all he ever said was , ' if you have a problem or you want a chat , give me a call			2
' @entity19 , @entity0 's old chairman at @entity20 , gave @entity0 the impression he had the @entity12 job can you believe that at quarter - past 10 the other night , just before dropping into the land of sweet dreams , i looked at my phone , which had been on silent all evening , and i noticed a missed call from @entity19			1
as we all know , he is now the chairman of the @entity38 and chooses the @entity12 manager			1
with more wins than any other manager in the country this season – more than @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 – i thought the time had come for @entity48 to step up to manage the @entity12			1
i never slept the whole night , working out where i was going to play @entity49 and which health spa to send @entity51 to rejuvenate his tired legs			2
sadly , he never called back again and i found myself the next day managing @entity6 away at @entity54 , in the @entity56 fourth - round qualifying			1
it 's top dog now - but we have to keep going it 's been an unbelievable , incredible start to the season for all the players , the staff and supporters at @entity6			1
we are flying at the top of the @entity70 table			1
but i remember , when i was an 11 - year - old boy , a long - distance runner called @entity72 , in the 1976 @entity73 10,000metre final			2
halfway through , he was about a lap ahead , and looked untouchable			2
he was striding to glory in his white vest with red and blue coloured band			2
jumping up and down on the settee , in our old - fashioned front room , i could not believe my eyes as he faded and drifted and anxiously looked over his shoulder			2
@entity84 's @entity6 side already have a nine - point lead at the top of the conference the other runners closed in , got close to him and gradually he faded away and had to settle for a bronze medal			1
that is the example i used with my @entity6 players about the season ahead			1
we made a pledge at @entity6 to train harder , improve our concentration , time - keeping , discipline , smartness , conduct and behaviour			1
there is still a long way to go this season and no time and no room to look over our shoulder and start fading			2
@entity106 , skipping and jumping at @entity109 i had the pleasure of being a special guest at my old club @entity109 for their sunday afternoon game against @entity14 a couple of weeks ago			0
it was weird sitting in the @entity114 stand , on the aisle where @entity116 , our old youth team manager , used to make us run , hop , jump and sprint up and down every step			0
i was a 16 - year - old who had just left school and @entity116 was fiercely demanding and his desire to improve all the young players physically and mentally would be frowned upon nowadays			0
but without that blood , sweat and tears , there is no way i would 've had a career as an average footballer			0
midfield general @entity0 played over 100 times for @entity109 between 1984 and 1989 @entity133 's analysis the player i keep hearing about ... @entity136 this goalkeeper is one to watch			1
i had the absolute pleasure of playing in a @entity109 team with the most laid - back , confident , calm goalkeeper			0
he never panicked or got stressed out			0
he oozed confidence , with his shoulders back , his head held high and a rascal of a dodgy moustache			0
@entity136 , seen here in action against @entity14 , is highly - rated by @entity48 his friday nights were n't spent at home eating spaghetti and fresh fruit salad			1
he spent his pre-game nights perched at the side of a river carp fishing and sleeping in a little tent			0
@entity148 was an amazing character			0
having watched @entity136 play , @entity161 has done well to pick him up for only £ 7m			0
with his stature , ability to come for crosses , strong body language , i think very soon he will be challenging @entity167 for @entity12 's no 1 jersey and go on to achieve what @entity148 did			1
he is top quality and top class			0
one thing i 'd change about ... @entity175 ' reputations all these football agents tend to have a bad reputation with most supporters			2
but they are vital in getting players in and out of clubs both to cut the wage bill and to try to improve your team			0
@entity185 's agent @entity184 is one of the most successful and wealthy agents there is			2
during my useless spell as manager of @entity190 , he was doing a deal to take @entity192 from @entity14 to @entity193 for £ 9m back in 2008			0
but in between negotiating the deal at @entity194 , he was texting me about a young midfielder available on a free transfer called @entity197			0
i 've got a lot of respect for someone who will still remember their client going on a free transfer when they 're doing a deal worth millions			0
he called me recently about an 18 - year - old centre forward , who is going to be a golden nugget for us			0
the big issue ... @entity13 i saw @entity13 play for @entity210 at @entity211 a couple of year ago and @entity212 substituted him 10 minutes after half - time			1
he never broke sweat and looked uninterested , fed up , and constantly waved his hands at his team - mates in disgust at their passes and their efforts			0
@entity212 hooked him and the few thousand @entity210 fans behind the goal all clapped him with energy and enthusiasm			0
@entity13 has struggled to make an impact at @entity14 since joining from @entity225 in the summer but he walked from the pitch , sulking , looking at the ground , and never once acknowledged the supporters who had paid their hard - earned cash to travel to @entity230 and buy a ticket to watch their heroes play			1
@entity233 has got a tough task to transform @entity13			1
there is no denying he can win you a game , but without a doubt a player like that will not win you the league .			0

@entity84 has led @entity6 to a superb start in the @entity70 so far
the bees are nine points ahead of nearest challengers @entity248
@entity0 had a missed call from his old chairman at @entity20 and the @entity38 's current chairman @entity19 last week
from that @entity48 thought he had landed the @entity12 job
@entity0 doubts whether @entity233 can change @entity13
