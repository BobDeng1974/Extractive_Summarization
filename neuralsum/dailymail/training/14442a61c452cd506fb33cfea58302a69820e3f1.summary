by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:49 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 3 june 2013 banks have cut the amount of money they have made available for loans despite taking billions from the government which was supposed to trigger a boom in lending			0
total lending by banks and building societies fell by £ 300million in the first three months of 2013 , leaving struggling small businesses ‘ out in the cold ’			1
however some of the biggest names on the high street have received billions of pounds from @entity18 ’s funding for lending scheme , including the banks owned by the taxpayer			1
net lending from some of @entity26 's biggest banks fell in the first three months of 2013 , new figures show new figures from the @entity28 reveal the slump in lending , renewing fears that the economy will struggle to grow if businesses are unable to access cheap and easy credit			1
@entity35 – 39 per cent owned by the @entity26 taxpayer - lent almost £ 1 billion less from january to march , despite taking £ 3 billion from the @entity28 and @entity37 scheme			1
a spokesman for @entity39 said : ' the acid test for the @entity42 's success is whether we are lending to @entity44 and @entity45			1
' we have been growing our sme lending by 4 % a year , on a net basis , and we have also pledged to increase our new lending to first time buyers to £ 6.5bn in 2013 compared to £ 6bn last year			1
' but as part of our effort to focus on these fundamental parts of the economy we are running down certain ‘ non-core ’ parts of our business			0
' the decline in our overall lending in the first three months of 2013 as reported in the latest @entity28 figures , is entirely the result of this shift in focus and the figures show a reducing rate of decline , which demonstrates the progress we are making towards achieving overall growth in our lending this year			0
' taxpayer - backed @entity68 also shrunk its net lending by £ 1.6 billion in the quarter , but has borrowed £ 750 million from the funding for lending scheme			1
the @entity28 said lending to homeowners has been positive but continues to fall to business			0
it added it will ‘ take time ’ for the scheme to feed through to bigger lending volumes			2
the funding for lending scheme has so far given £ 16.5billion to 40 participating lenders			2
but their lending has shrunk by a net £ 1.8 billion since the scheme was launched in august			2
write caption here @entity85 , executive director for markets at the @entity28 , said the net lending fall was ‘ broadly as expected ’			0
he added : ‘ the plans of the @entity42 participants suggest that net lending volumes will pick up gradually through the remainder of 2013			0
’ there had been an increase in mortgage lending homebuyers but credit to businesses has ‘ mostly been negative ’			1
@entity98 - owned bank @entity97 cut its net lending by £ 2.3 billion as it continued its retreat from riskier parts of the mortgage market			2
the @entity42 was recently beefed up to extend more loans to credit - starved small businesses after criticism over its impact			1
the scheme offers lenders discounted loans in return for boosting the flow of credit to the economy			2
the pace of lending decline slowed from a net £ 2.4 billion decrease in the final three months of 2012 , and the @entity28 said net lending should pick up and turn ‘ modestly positive ’ over the rest of the year			0
since last august banks have received billions of pounds from @entity18 's funding for lending scheme @entity122 , which has borrowed £ 6 billion from the @entity42 , increased its lending by £ 1.1 billion during the quarter			1
@entity124 also hiked its lending by £ 1.2 billion after drawing £ 2.5 billion from the scheme			2
there were also major credit injections from firms including @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
but the scheme was criticised for failing to boost credit to businesses			1
@entity135 , director general of the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) , said : ‘ the real test for @entity120 for lending is whether it is able to get credit flowing to young and fast - growing businesses			1
‘ unfortunately many of these growth firms are still being left out in the cold when it comes to accessing finance , which prevents them from expanding , creating jobs and helping to drive a business - led recovery			0
’ @entity151 general secretary @entity150 said : ‘ @entity138 scheme is not providing the support small businesses need in these tough economic times			0
‘ it seems that some banks are just using the funding for lending to improve their capital position			0
‘ this is why we need a properly resourced state investment bank that can provide the assistance firms need to grow and create jobs			0

businesses find it harder to get credit despite @entity18 's *flagship* scheme to increase lending
taxpayer - backed @entity172 and @entity68 see some of the biggest falls
