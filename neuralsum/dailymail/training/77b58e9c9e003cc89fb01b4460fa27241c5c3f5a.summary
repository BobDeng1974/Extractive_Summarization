@entity1 hopes for a medal at @entity3 were brutally snuffed out as each of the participating home nations lost in the rugby sevens quarter - finals			1
another 45,000 - strong turned out at the home of football giants @entity9 for the second day of action - with the loudest cheer reserved for @entity12 as they took on @entity14			1
but , despite putting up a brave fight , the @entity16 2014 hosts joined @entity18 and @entity19 in crashing out of the tournament after slumping to a 35 - 12 defeat			1
tough draw : @entity23 of @entity12 holds off the challenge of @entity25 of @entity14 @entity12 had pushed world champions and four - time @entity29 champions @entity28 close in saturday 's group - stage meeting but failed to replicate that intensity as they fell three tries behind the @entity14 early on			1
' we 're massively disappointed , ' @entity12 coach @entity34 said			1
' we made far too many errors against a quality team			0
' we did n't learn the lesson from the first half against @entity28 yesterday and the same things happened to us again			2
' if you give one of the best teams in the world a 20 - point start you will end up with that outcome			0
' but i do n't think there is a massive gulf between us and the southern - hemisphere teams			0
we showed against @entity28 what we can do			2
but we do need to work hard to close the gap further			0
' winner : @entity54 of @entity55 scores the winning try during their quarter - final against @entity19 the @entity59 found themselves 21 - 0 down as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 all crossed over			1
but @entity23 gave his side hope when he pulled a score back just before the break			0
expectations rose further when @entity68 - who scored five tries on the opening day of action - grabbed another at the start of the second half but , when skipper @entity75 sent his conversion attempt wide , @entity12 's momentum faltered			1
that allowed @entity14 to step up the pressure and @entity62 and @entity79 put the seal on their victory with two further touchdowns			2
there was agony too for @entity19 in the first last - eight clash of the afternoon			2
they led @entity55 19 - 7 at half - time but were left sickened after the hooter went when @entity90 stuck over a last - gasp conversion to seal a 21 - 19 win and a semi-final slot against the @entity28			1
diving try : @entity95 of @entity96 is tackled by @entity97 of @entity12 as he scores a try and @entity18 were also punished with a 15 - 14 defeat by @entity96			1
leading by @entity103 's try , they soon found themselves behind as @entity105 was penalised for his late challenge on @entity107 as he grounded the @entity109 ' first score in first - half stoppage time			0
he was sin - binned and @entity96 allowed one last attack before the break			2
they made the most of it as @entity107 ran in another score , while @entity95 added a third try early in the second half			0
@entity119 pulled one back for the @entity121 after running on to his own chip but it was not enough to save their medal hopes , with @entity96 now progressing to face @entity14			1
@entity105 admitted his disappointment but felt his yellow card was harsh			0
' it was just the ref 's interpretation , ' he said			0
' their player was taking his time to put the ball down and i made a challenge on him			0
the ref said i took him after the whistle had gone			0
' we came here for a medal , so to lose like that is annoying			0
' @entity12 now take on @entity18 in the plate semi-finals on sunday evening , while the @entity143 meet @entity144 .			1

@entity12 crashed out after losing 35 - 12 to @entity14 at @entity3
@entity19 had earlier lost to @entity55 in their quarter - final , while @entity18 *limped* out following a 15 - 14 loss to @entity96
@entity12 coach @entity34 said he was ' massively disappointed '
@entity96 are up next for @entity14 , and @entity55 will battle it out with @entity28 in the other semi-final
