millions of barren patches of land , known as ' fairy circles ' , can be found across the @entity3 in southern @entity4			1
the mystery of how they got there , or why they stay there , has stumped scientists for decades but these strange patterns may in fact be the result of underground competition for resources among plants , according to new research by @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity4			0
fairy circles , which can be 2 - 12m in diameter , are found in the region ’s arid grassland on sandy soils			1
a ring of vegetation that is taller than the grassland usually surrounds the barren patch			2
the theory states that the nutrient - poor soil and lack of rainfall causes increased competition between plants in the @entity3			1
the stronger types of grass soak up all the nutrients causing other plants in the area to die			1
this leaves a barren patch in the landscape which later becomes a reservoir for nutrients and water			1

‘ the consequent barren circle may provide a resource - reservoir essential for the survival of the larger peripheral grasses , ’ said the researchers , writing in the journal @entity107			0
‘ it 's a really good theory because it accounts for all the characteristics of fairy circles , ’ @entity113 biologist @entity112 , who was not involved in the study , told @entity115			1
‘ no other proposed cause for fairy circles has ever done that			2
’ in april @entity122 from the @entity123 claimed that a species of sand termite was responsible for the patterns			0
he examined hundreds of fairy circles in more than 1,200 miles of the desert and found that the @entity129 , or sand termite , was the only species consistently present			1
mr @entity122 theory states that they eat plant roots before they can sprout through the desert soil creating a water trap - in a similar way that beavers create dams			0
because of the lack of foliage , rainwater is not lost through transpiration ( the evaporation of water from plants ) and instead stays below the surface			0

he examined hundreds of fairy circles in more than 1,200 miles of the desert and found that the @entity129 , or sand termite , was the only species consistently present this allows the sand termites to survive and stay active during the dry season and also helps grasses at the edge of the circle to thrive attracting other life forms			2
the termites feed on those grasses , thereby gradually extending the circle			0
mr @entity122 concluded that the fairy circles are actually an astounding example of ecological engineering by the sand termite , designed to retain precious water in an otherwise arid landscape			2
mr @entity34 , lead researcher of the current study , has dismissed the termite theory			0
‘ i think the major hurdle that explanations have to overcome is explaining the regular spacing of the circles , their approximate circularity and their size , ’ mr @entity34 told @entity115			0
‘ there 's no real reason why termites would produce such large circles that are so evenly spaced			0
’ the current theory is backed up by previous research in which mathematical models show that the vegetation pattern of fairy circles could depend on water availability			2

fairy circles are circular , barren patches of land that are found in the @entity3 of southern @entity4 and are *steeped* in *mythology*
latest theory suggests they are caused by plants competing for nutrients
stronger types of grass soak up nutrients leaving the *weaker* ones to die
this causes a barren patch of land that can be 2 - 12m in diameter
