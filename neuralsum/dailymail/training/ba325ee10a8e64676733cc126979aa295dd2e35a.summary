by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 11:07 est , 22 january 2014 a rare blue diamond that might fetch over £ 10 million when it is sold , and could break world records for its clarity , has been discovered in a mine in @entity6			1
the diamond , which came from the famous @entity9 mine 25 miles from @entity10 , is going to be sold at auction soon , but the owners of the mine , @entity14 , do n't know how much it will truly be worth until a buyer emerges , saying ' it depends on what people are prepared to pay for it '			1
while the diamond still needs further forensic investigation , the company that found it already think they have unearthed a ' very special diamond			1
' blue diamonds are the most coveted in the world thanks to their rarity , and the @entity29 mine the most important source for them in the world blue diamonds are some of the rarest diamonds in the world , and only make up around 0.1 % of all diamonds found every year			1
@entity14 has only found four blue diamonds since they took over the @entity9 mine in 2008			2
how much a diamond is worth is often decided by three factors ; the flawlessness , the colour , and the rarity			0
while this latest blue diamond still needs further assessment , it has already been deemed as ' on the large end ' and ' exceptional			0
' a spokesperson for @entity14 said : ' it 's a very special diamond			2
' you do n't usually get diamond blues of this size or clarity			2
there 's going to be a lot of interest in it in the diamond buying community			0
' ceo of @entity58 holding the coveted stone , which has the potential to yield an incredibly important cut diamond ' the stone is an outstanding vivid blue with extraordinary saturation , tone and clarity			1
' it has the potential to yield a polished stone of great value and importance			0
' it may well even break new records			0
' when the diamond is bought it will likely be cut and polished , meaning it could lose between one third and half of is mass , depending on the quality of the stone			1
located at the foothills of the @entity85 mountain range , the @entity9 mine is 37 miles north - east of @entity10 in @entity6			0
the mine has a history of producing blue diamonds , but its regular yield is mostly small white diamonds , earning its owner a revenue of around £ 133 million a year from 800,000 carats in total			0
the diamond has yet to be cut , a process which will make it significantly smaller , as it involves shaping it , and cutting off a lot of its mass the @entity9 diamond mine first made waves in 1905 when it unearthed the largest rough gem diamond ever found , a massive 3,106 carats			1
this diamond was named ' @entity105 ' , and became famous in @entity107 culture when it was mounted in the @entity108 , part of the @entity111 's crown jewels			1
other notable diamonds produced by the mine include the @entity114 , which was 353 carats rough and valued at around $ 10 million ( £ 6 million ) , and the @entity115 , 545 carats , worth up to $ 14 million ( £ 8.5 million ) - the largest cut and faceted diamond in the world			2
@entity9 has made a few very important diamond discoveries since 2008 when @entity14 took over the mine , including a 39.9 carat diamond which sold for $ 8.8 million ( £ 4.8 million ) , a 26.6 carat diamond which sold for $ 1.45 million ( £ 881,030 ) and a 25.5 carat diamond which sold for $ 16.8 million ( £ 10.2 million ) last year .			0

@entity125 still needs forensic tests , but discoverers think it is ' very special '
found in mine famous for ' @entity131 ' stone in @entity111 's *sceptre*
@entity125 to lose between *1/3* and *1/2* of mass when cut , depending on clarity
