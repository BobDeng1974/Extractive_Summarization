they are supposed to be the dream team who can solve the conundrum of how to win the election			0
but @entity5 and @entity6 were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children 's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons			1
as the @entity15 mayor tried to hammer ill - fitting pieces together with his hands , the prime minister tried out what could be a new election slogan , telling him : ' if in doubt , wedge it in			1
' after being put right by a four - year - old who spotted their errors , the pair had more fun finger painting with @entity27 blue paint			0
@entity5 and @entity6 were left stumped by the puzzle at @entity29 in @entity30 , as three - year - old @entity31 looked on when they tried to put the puzzle back together , they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected the conservative duo made their first appearance together on the campaign trail with a visit to advantage day nursery in @entity30 , south west @entity15			1
they were supposed to be highlighting @entity27 plans to double free childcare for 600,000 children aged three and four			1
they sat at a table with @entity46 and @entity31 , both aged three , and four - year - olds @entity47 and @entity49 where they broke up a puzzle which depicted the four seasons			2
when they tried to put it back together , they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected			0
after taking nine minutes to complete the puzzle , the @entity27 duo were relieved to try their hand at hand painting , which they found much easier the pair were at the nursery in @entity30 to promote a @entity27 pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four - year - olds to 30 hours a week arriving at the nursery , mr @entity5 appeared to be giving mr @entity6 a ticking off before the visit had even started like a bad workman blaming his tools , mr @entity6 soon started to question whether there was a fundamental design fault			1
' january is in winter , ' he complained			0
' there 's something wrong with the puzzle			2
' the clock ticked on and @entity27 aides grew nervous , as mr @entity5 insisted : we 've got all day			1
' mr @entity6 , fearing defeat , was adamant : ' we ca n't be beaten by the puzzle			1
' with the media crowding into classroom , @entity47 asked mr @entity5 why there were so many journalists			1
' if we finish the puzzle it will make them go away , ' the @entity85 said			0
but the children had spotted more errors			2
' i 've found another problem , ' said @entity49			0
mr @entity6 , already known as a political heavyweight , then tried brute force to get the pieces to fit by hammering them with his fist			1
he had the backing of the @entity85 who declared : ' if in doubt , wedge it in			1
' @entity102 got into less mess with blue paint during a visit to the @entity107 allotment project in @entity108 , @entity109 fearing it might be taking too long , and perhaps that the puzzle might get broken , a teacher then stepped in to point out yet more problems			2
' this one is not right , ' she said			0
' this one goes there			0
' as the last piece went in to cheers - nearly nine minutes after they began - mr @entity5 initiated a group hug			1
' thank @entity121 for that			0
that was stressful , ' he said			0
' i do have to have a hug after that			0
' mr @entity6 joked : ' that was a bit like the ( election ) campaign ... suddenly , the final surge			2
' ' it all comes together in the end , ' said mr @entity5 , before stopping one of the children taking the puzzle to pieces			1
' do n't break it up again - i ca n't take the stress			0
' afterwards the two men joined another group of children for a hand painting session - appropriately using blue paint .			2
