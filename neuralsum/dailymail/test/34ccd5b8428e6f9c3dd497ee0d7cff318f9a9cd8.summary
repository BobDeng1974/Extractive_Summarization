@entity0 will today claim that @entity2 's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work after @entity5 was singled out as one of the few ' bright spots ' in the global economy			1
the prime minister will vow to encourage more job creation by extending national insurance breaks , worth at least £ 2,000 a year to smaller firms taking on new staff , for a further five years			1
saying he is ' really angry ' at @entity2 's claim that the @entity15 are ' the party for the few , not the many ' , mr @entity0 will hail the ' jobs miracle ' that has seen 1,000 new jobs created every day			1
@entity0 will today claim that @entity2 's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work contrasting that with @entity2 's record , he will claim @entity21 's economic policies could see ' a million more people joining the dole queues '			1
last night , in a boost for @entity24 , the head of the @entity25 picked out the @entity5 recovery as exemplary			0
@entity27 said the world was suffering from a ' moderate and uneven ' return to growth which was ' simply not good enough '			0
but , in an endorsement of the government 's economic record , she cited the @entity34 and the @entity5 as countries where the outlook is positive			1
the comments completed an extraordinary volte - face by the @entity25 on the @entity40 's handling of the economy			0
just two years ago , it warned that mr @entity24 was ' playing with fire ' by pressing ahead with austerity – only to see the economic recovery take off			0
@entity5 was the best performing major economy in the developed world last year , with growth of 2.8 per cent			0
figures published by the fund also show it has overtaken socialist - run @entity52 to become the second most powerful economy in @entity54 behind @entity55			0
however , the @entity25 predicted @entity5 would still be running a deficit at the end of the decade – despite @entity15 efforts to balance the books			0
@entity0 will say if @entity21 repeated the economic mistakes of last @entity2 government there will be a risk to jobs mr @entity0 , who dismissed the projections , will today launch a @entity15 ' jobs manifesto ' setting out plans to bring about ' full employment ' – meaning everyone who wants a job has one			1
' we are living through a jobs miracle – brought to you by a @entity15 government that has backed business , reformed welfare and rewarded work , ' he will say			0
claiming mr @entity21 represents a threat to jobs , he will add : ' you know what makes me really angry ? it 's when our opponents still go on about ' you @entity86 – the party for the few and not the many … ' excuse me ? ' this is the party that 's taken three million of the lowest - paid workers out of income tax altogether ; that 's cut the taxes of 26million working people ; that 's seen 1,000 jobs created every day – jobs that are giving families security , putting food on tables , helping people out of poverty			1
' under the last five years of @entity2 , unemployment went up by 600 people a day			2
' so if @entity21 repeated the economic mistakes of the last @entity2 government – that he was a part of – he risks a million more people joining the dole queues			1
' the jobs manifesto will include a guarantee to maintain the so - called ' employment allowance ' until 2020 , meaning a third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax for another five years			2
the tax break , which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first £ 2,000 of employers ' national insurance , has already been taken up by 856,000 firms			1
@entity0 pictured on a metal platform yesterday ( left ) and @entity127 on his soap box in 1992 ( right ) one of the most abiding images from the 1992 general election campaign was the moment @entity127 got on his soap box			2
and yesterday @entity0 did the same ... but gave it a 21st century twist by taking to a folding metal platform			2
during a campaign stop in @entity137 , the prime minister raised himself above the closely packed crowd to engage in a question and answer session with employees at the @entity143 office in @entity144 and @entity145 – the marginal constituency of shadow chancellor @entity147			0
@entity148 climbed onto an old fashioned soap box in @entity150 to persuade conservatives to come out and vote in 1992 , just ten days before the election			0
he went on to win the fourth consecutive victory for the @entity86 – and their last outright @entity5 majority .			2

@entity0 will launch ' job manifesto ' with plans for ' full employment '
@entity86 will extend national insurance breaks , worth £ 2,000 to smaller firms
@entity135 is ' angry ' at @entity2 's claim @entity86 are ' party for the few , not the many '
he will say @entity21 's economic policies risk putting millions out of work
