by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 2 april 2013 from model - of - the - moment @entity2 to the @entity4 , there has never been a better time to be ditch the tweezers in favour of the heavy power brow			0
and ever since 20 - year - old @entity2 caught the world 's attention walking in forty shows over @entity13 , there has been a boom in semi-permanent cosmetic eyebrow - thickening treatments			2
one such clinic that offers the service to emulate @entity2 's big - brows look has been fully - booked for the past two months , with orders for the treatment up 200 per cent on the previous year			1
the 22 - year - old star has recently had the @entity44 treatment at @entity46 clinic in @entity47 in order to get more definition and depth after seeing @entity2 at @entity13			1
@entity33 said : ' i love the look that @entity2 has got and i ’m really pleased that strong brows are back in again			1
i ’m thrilled with the results of my @entity44 treatment			2
' an over-arched , over plucked eyebrow not only dates your look - it ages you too			0
that is why , reports the clinic , the number of women seeking to enhance their brows has surged in recent months			0
before and after : @entity33 is thrilled with her new eyebrows and is sure to turn some heads in the new episodes @entity33 added : ' the great strength of the @entity44 is that it looks totally natural even close up because the brows are built up using hundreds of individual hair strokes			1
' in the past i have beefed up my eyebrows with an eye - pencil but this can be very time consuming on a daily basis and even then does n’t always have the intensity or the staying power that i ’m looking for			0
' so i ’ve enlisted the help of semi-permanent make - up artist @entity46			2
' the procedure itself takes about 30 minutes , and @entity46 talked it through with @entity33 and precisely measured the shape and angle of her brows so that the finished result would be symmetrical and the perfect proportions for her face			1
an anaesthetic cream had been applied to her brows before they started deciding the shape of them			0
it took 15 minutes for the cream to take effect , and during that time @entity46 created a custom - blended pigment for the hair strokes which is a perfect match for your hair , eye and skin colour			2
speaking after the treatment , @entity33 said : ' i could barely feel a thing			1
' it was amazing and i was really overjoyed with the results			0
you can see the improvement in the before and after pictures			0
' in the ' before ' the start of the brow near my nose is thin and it gets very messy and sparse at the peak and there are wispy bits at the tail of the brow , whereas my new @entity44 is stronger and frames the eye beautifully			0
' the £ 760 treatment can last for several months			1

@entity33 had £ 760 treatment at @entity46 clinic in @entity47
treatment bookings are up 200 *%* on last year
