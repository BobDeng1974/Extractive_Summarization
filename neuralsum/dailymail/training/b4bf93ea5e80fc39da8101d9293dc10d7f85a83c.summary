he is thinking of the family he has behind him			1
thinking of partner @entity2 , whom he recently wed , and their two - year - old daughter @entity4			1
‘ all the love and help that i get from them is special , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m a happy man			1
’ sitting in a @entity10 hotel , @entity0 looks like any other proud father			1
he does n’t look ill. a little thinner than in his playing pomp maybe , but you could walk past him and never guess at the burden he carries			1
had his ups and downs : former @entity17 man @entity0 tells all in his new book , @entity19 it is only when @entity0 begins to speak that the creeping toll taken by @entity21 becomes fully apparent in his slurred enunciation			1
it has been seven months since he revealed to the world , via a heart - breaking television interview , that he was battling this incurable condition which gradually erodes muscle control			1
‘ at the moment , i feel good , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m not getting better but the most important thing is i ’m not getting worse			1
i feel physically good , only my talking is poor			1
’ he is back in the city that was once his playground during six years as a @entity17 player to attend the @entity36 launch of his autobiography			2
it is the story of a life lived to the full , if not quite the full story			2
asked if he had left out any tales within his catalogue of high - octane mayhem , @entity0 begins to laugh			1
co-author @entity44 reveals the one - time @entity46 international told him only about 50 per cent of what actually happened was included			1
‘ i do n’t want to hurt other people , ’ insists @entity0			1
‘ we left out most of the other names in the book			2
at least those names who have family lives			2
we did n’t want to cause any divorces … ’ it makes you wonder just what else went on			2
the stuff that has actually made it into print is a riotous blend of drink , drugs and sex			1
lots and lots of sex			1
there is excess , addiction and redemption			2
for long enough , @entity0 seemed to tackle every aspect of his existence with the manic intensity that made him such an on - field success			1
fan favourite : the @entity76 spent six trophy - laden years at @entity78 between 2000 and 2006 struggle : @entity0 revealed he was battling @entity21 seven months ago it was during the project of writing the book that he began to feel there was something wrong			1
his illness is covered only in a short , defiant epilogue			2
‘ within a few years you kick the bucket , in normal cases , ’ he writes			2
‘ @entity90 cases , yes			2
but i ’m not a normal guy			2
’ @entity0 draws strength not only from his family , but from the numerous fans who have sent their best wishes			1
he received a phenomenal ovation at @entity78 in january when he took to the field at half - time in a match against @entity100			2
‘ the reaction i have had has been amazing , ’ he admits			2
‘ from the moment i knew i was ill it has been incredible			2
everybody has been there for me			2
‘ it has helped me to stay positive and just accept what is happening			2
it was in the summer of last year that i realised i was not well			2
i got the final diagnosis and it was difficult , very difficult			0
‘ but i got an incredible reaction when i came back to @entity10 and went to @entity78			0
going on to the pitch that day will stay with me			0
when i saw the fans i became really emotional			0
‘ from the moment i came to @entity17 until the moment i left , that was the best time			0
i will treasure these memories			0
’ @entity0 hopes to see his old club back at the top but has little interest in the endless boardroom turmoil at @entity78			1
‘ i ’m fighting another battle – not that one , ’ he says			0
his book was released in @entity46 last november and has topped the bestseller list en route to selling 70,000 copies			1
according to @entity127 , money earned from it will be used to fund @entity4 ’s education and protect her future			0
she will also one day be able to read about many of the naughty things her dad got up to during a career that encompassed @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , as well as @entity17			0
@entity0 , though , felt it was important to be as honest as he could be , as long as he was only implicating himself in the juicier yarns			1
out ! former @entity17 boss @entity139 ( left ) caught @entity0 drunk at 9am while on @entity46 duty ‘ it is great to see my life in print , ’ he says			1
‘ i am very proud of the book			0
‘ a lot of what is here was on the front pages of newspapers at the time , so a lot of people already know some the things that i ’ve done in my life			0
‘ people have asked me , “ how do you remember if you were always drunk ? ” but i do remember , i remember everything and all aspects of my life			0
‘ some of the stories are nicer to tell than others			0
but i do n’t have any regrets - if i did i would have no book			0
’ spent the evening : @entity0 had a one - night romp with @entity162 alcohol was @entity0 ’s main vice of choice in @entity166			1
cocaine became prevalent in @entity168			0
the women were plentiful in both			0
@entity0 once spent a night with glamour model @entity162 when at @entity17			1
then there was a period when four strippers shared his apartment in @entity174			0
he was not , it ’s fair to say , an easy player to manage			0
@entity139 did so at both @entity17 and @entity136 , but it was an incident when on @entity46 duty that most upset @entity179			1
the @entity76 team hotel in @entity181 just happened to have a strip club in the basement			0
@entity0 stepped into it after a game against @entity186 and was still there five minutes before the bus back to the airport was due to depart the next morning			1
he made it - but only after kicking down the doors to both his own room and that of @entity194 in a desperate search for his bags			0
‘ i was still drunk at nine in the morning , ’ admits @entity0			1
‘ @entity139 was n’t happy			0
after that , i was never called again to the national team			0
‘ that hurt me the most			0
the money did n’t matter			0
it was always about football			0
but if i was the coach , i would have done the same as @entity139			0
’ former team - mate @entity203 spent time with @entity0 at the book launch and is among a host of star names who will play in a testimonial game in @entity209 a week tomorrow			1
‘ i have been trying to keep my emotions in check and just speak to him as usual , ’ says the @entity210			0
‘ this illness shows you that you need to enjoy life every day			0
to see him laugh and joke the way he does is unbelievable			0
i do n’t know how i would take it in his position			0
but @entity0 has always been a fighter			1
’ he ’s still fighting			0
