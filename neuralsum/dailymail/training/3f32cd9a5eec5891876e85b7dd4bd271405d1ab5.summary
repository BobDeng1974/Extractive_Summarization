much of it has already been recovered , and although mr @entity10 , who has nearly 30 years of diving experience , and his team had a look for the remaining 20 bars - worth almost £ 6million - they could not find the underwater treasure			1

' recovery of the gold was top priority but to this day 20 bars remain unaccounted for , which are worth nearly £ 6million			1
mr @entity10 said : ' due to the exposed location and depth , only divers trained in the use of mixed gas ( use of helium mixed in with our breathing gas ) can operate safely at these depths			0
' @entity15 has become legendary among this community of " technical divers " as having some of the best wrecks in the world			0
it is an amazing feeling to be able to photograph some of these amazing historical wrecks			0

stunning photographs show the *ghostly* images of @entity25 and @entity5 ships off coast of @entity18
