a former @entity1 officer has been convicted of leaking classified details of a @entity4 operation to thwart @entity6 's nuclear ambitions to a @entity8 reporter			1
@entity9 , 47 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was found guilty of all nine counts he faced in federal court in @entity14 on monday			1
the decision came just hours after the jury , which had been deliberating for three days , told the judge they could not reach a unanimous verdict - but the judge urged them to keep talking			0
throughout the two - week trial they had been trying to determine who had told journalist @entity25 about the secret mission , which he wrote about in his 2006 book @entity27			1
who was his source ? @entity8 reporter @entity25 , pictured , wrote about a secret operation in 2006 , and on monday , former @entity1 officer @entity9 was found guilty of leaking the information to him former secretary of state @entity32 had testified the mission was one of the government 's most closely held secrets and one of its best chances to thwart @entity6 's nuclear - weapons ambitions			1
prosecutors had fought to force @entity25 to divulge his sources for years , but they decided not to call him to testify once it became clear he would not reveal his sources even if jailed for contempt of court			1
prosecutors acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against @entity9 but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming			0
they claim he divulged the secrets because he was bitter about his treatment at the agency			0
but defense lawyers argued that the evidence showed that @entity57 staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak			2
shock : former secretary of state @entity32 , pictured last year , testified the mission was one of the government 's most closely held secrets and one of its best chances to thwart @entity6 's nuclear - weapons the plan involved using a @entity1 asset nicknamed @entity71 , who had been a @entity73 nuclear engineer , to foist deliberately flawed nuclear - weapons blueprints on the @entity6 , hoping they would spend years trying to develop parts that had no hope of ever working			1
questions : @entity9 described the mission as hopelessly botched in his 2006 book , pictured in @entity27 , @entity9 described the mission as hopelessly botched , and possibly backfiring by giving the @entity6 blueprints that could be useful to them if they sorted out the good information from the errors			1
in his closing arguments , prosecutor @entity85 said the chapter of @entity25 's book seemed to be clearly written from @entity9 's perspective as @entity71 's case handler and cast him in a flattering light			1
the book describes the handler 's misgivings about the operation while others at the @entity1 push the plan through despite its risks			2
furthermore , @entity9 , who was fired from the @entity1 in 2002 , believed he had been mistreated and was angry that the agency refused to settle his racial discrimination complaint , @entity85 said			2
@entity25 had written about that complaint , and he was known to have a relationship with @entity9			0
the two exchanged dozens of phone calls and emails , @entity85 said			0
but defense lawyers said the government had no evidence that @entity25 and @entity9 talked about anything classified in those phone calls and emails			2
the government failed to obtain @entity25 's records to see who else he may have contacted			0
defense attorney @entity114 said @entity25 first got wind of the operation in early 2003 , within weeks of @entity117 reporting his misgivings to staffers at a @entity121 intelligence committee - a channel that @entity9 was legally allowed to pursue			2
@entity114 said it makes more sense that a @entity126 staffer leaked to @entity25			0
@entity9 now faces years in prison			0
@entity4 district judge @entity128 allowed @entity117 to remain free on bond until his sentencing on april 24 .			0

the *covert* mission involved a @entity73 asset nicknamed @entity71 who *funneled* deliberately flawed blueprints to @entity6
former secretary of state @entity32 testified the mission was one of the most closely *guarded* secrets during @entity152 's first term
prosecutors said @entity9 had been ' bitter ' towards the @entity1 , but his defense team said a @entity57 staffer was more likely the source of the leak
