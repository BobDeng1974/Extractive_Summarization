’ a tender spokesman said : ‘ though research on the rise of domestic violence during the @entity4 is relatively new and for lack of a better word , sparse , the trend is alarming and impossible to ignore			1
‘ the weather is getting warmer , more drinks will be consumed , emotions will be heightened , and none of this excuses violence			0
we ask that individuals and organisations to stand together this @entity4 season and say “ no excuses ”			0
