@entity0 , the unparalleled voice of @entity2 , is expected to be absent from sunday ’s race			1
@entity0 , 91 later this year , told @entity4 : ‘ this is going to sound big headed - and i do n’t mean it to - but if i go the @entity8 @entity7 i do n’t get any peace at all			1
' it ’s very touching but i am there as an enthusiast			1
it is also gigantically tiring and i do n’t have the stamina i once had			0
the circuit ’s bosses may be disappointed not to have attracted a sell - out crowd - there are still 3,000 seats to fill			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity28 issued an apology following his ill - advised comments about @entity16			1
the @entity31 was asked whether he 'd like a female team - mate ahead of this weekend ' s race , to which he replied : ' no , they are better off in the kitchen			2
' but @entity28 moved to rectify his comments saying : ' i feel really ashamed by the way my words have been distorted			1
i want to be absolutely clear that my intention was not to offend anyone			0
' @entity16 , who became the first female racer in 22 years after she took to the wheel of the @entity45 in friday 's practice session , did n't appear offended by @entity28 's remarks			1
' saw some comments made by @entity28 as i was making dinner in the kitchen last night , ' @entity16 , who lasted just four laps on her full @entity2 debut after suffering an oil - pressure problem , said			1
' please give him a break			2
his comments were taken completely out of context			0
anyway , as my family will tell you , i drive better than i cook			0
' disappointing debut : @entity45 ' @entity16 was was forced to retire from first practice after an engine failure @entity45 have launched a @entity63 - branded motorhome in the @entity20 paddock			1
the building , which stretches over three floors , has walls adorned with largely amusing black andwhite photos of sir @entity45 , the team ’s founder , his daughter , @entity71 , who is also the team ’s deputy principal , and drivers @entity73 and @entity75			2
construction began on the motorhome in march and is incomparable to their former one - floored home			0
‘ we ’re loving it ; it looks amazing at night as well because of all the lovely lights , ’ said @entity80			0
‘ there will be a few @entity88 drunk , ’ she added with a smile			0
the @entity45 motorhome is among 600 tons of equipment - enough to fill 100 freight trucks - transported for teams , broadcasters and hospitality at every race			2
@entity96 , @entity2 's official logistics partner , delivrt the entire cargo to the next race , or back at the team 's headquarters , dependant on their preference , within 48 hours of the chequered flag falling			2
@entity103 , chancellor of the exchequer , spent saturday 's qualifying session with @entity106 boss @entity105			0
@entity103 , who also sported a team jacket , proved to be somewhat of a good luck omen for the @entity8 constructor with @entity110 claiming his best qualifying result of the season			1
he will start from third as he bids to battle his torrid run of bad luck at @entity20			1
incredibly , in 14 previous attempts , the @entity116 has never stood on the podium at his home race			0
over in @entity123 's garage , @entity121 actor @entity120 hid behind a pair of dark sunglasses despite the overcast conditions in @entity127			0
former @entity129 cricket captain @entity128 was the star on show at @entity45 , while number cruncher @entity131 made her customary @entity8 @entity7 appearance courtesy of @entity134			1
remaining in the paddock , @entity136 's impressive new statue outside his motorhome has been course of much discussion this weekend			0
the muscular statue complete with a silver helmet and what appears to be a silver exhaust trailing from its back - you need to see it to believe it - is not thought to modelled on the diminutive 83 - year - old ringmaster .			0

@entity0 has *decided* to give the @entity8 @entity7 a miss as he would n't ' get any peace '
@entity20 has sold 124,000 tickets for sunday ’s race
@entity16 has *poured* cold water over her supposed rift with @entity28
