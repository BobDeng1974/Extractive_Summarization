@entity0 has insisted that new powers for @entity2 allowing them to seize money from people 's bank accounts is necessary if people want to avoid tax rises taxes will have to rise unless @entity2 is given new powers to raid bank accounts , @entity0 insisted yesterday			1
amid controversy over whether the taxman should be allowed to take money to settle debts without permission , the prime minister suggested one of the alternatives was to ‘ raise tax rates ’			2
in a tv interview he said : ‘ we have a choice here			0
‘ if we do n’t collect taxes properly and [ do n’t ] make sure people pay their taxes properly we look at the problems of having to raise tax rates			2
‘ i do n’t want to do that , so i support the changes the chancellor set out in the budget which is to really say that not paying your taxes is not acceptable			0
‘ it is very clear that they can only do this if there is a debt of over £ 1,000 , they can only do it if there ’s £ 5,000 or more in the account after this has been completed			1
‘ the principle is do we want to pursue every avenue of making people pay the taxes they are meant to pay before we put up taxes – because that ’s the alternative – absolutely , yes we do			0
’ joint accounts could also be targeted – even if one of the account holders is not being chased by the taxman			1
@entity2 insists it will not take money from anyone with less than £ 5,000 in their bank account in order to stop people being left cash - strapped			1
but accountants say that means revenue dodgers would simply avoid being targeted by moving their money out of their bank accounts			1
@entity66 have already warned that the power granted to @entity2 to remove cash from bank accounts without court orders is ‘ very concerning ’			1
they believe taxpayers could suffer ‘ serious detriment ’ if officials take money from people who have done no wrong			0
a string of critics say the proposals , which were contained in the fine print of the @entity81 , could also end up punishing the innocent			0
@entity82 , director of the @entity84 think - tank , said : ‘ plans to allow @entity2 to take money directly from the accounts of tax delinquents are a fundamental assault on the rule of law			1
under new proposals , the taxman would be allowed to take cash from anyone who owed more than £ 1,000 , as long as it left at least £ 5,000 in their account afterwards ' next year is the 800th anniversary of @entity99 , but the basic civil protections it gave citizens against arbitrary power are being systematically eroded			1
’ @entity104 , from @entity105 , said : ‘ these plans represent nothing less than @entity2 wanting to act as judge , jury and executioner			2
‘ these powers would increase the risk of @entity2 wrongly collecting money from taxpayers , a warning that the @entity116 and @entity117 would be reckless to ignore			2
’ confidence in the tax authorities has been eroded by a series of errors , including sending incorrect tax codes to millions of pensioners over a number of years			0
@entity125 , tax partner at accountants @entity127 , said the ‘ potential consequences have not been thought through ’			0
‘ this could lead to the situation where struggling businesses are pushed under , ’ he said			0
‘ imagine if it then turned out @entity2 had made a mistake			0
you might get your tax back but that does n’t help you if you ’ve lost your job			0
’ @entity143 , tax policy director at the @entity145 , said : ‘ the type of people we ’re after , who are smart and have decided to give @entity2 the runaround , will make sure there is n’t enough money in their account for @entity2 to go after			2
’ he added : ‘ allowing @entity2 a free run at bank accounts will end up with some very unhappy little old ladies			1

@entity0 has insisted that new powers for @entity2 are necessary
without them , @entity158 warns , government may be forced to raise taxes
proposals would allow taxman to seize cash directly from bank accounts
could hit those owing £ 1,000 , as long as account has £ 5,00 left after
joint accounts could be raided even if only one account holder owes cash
