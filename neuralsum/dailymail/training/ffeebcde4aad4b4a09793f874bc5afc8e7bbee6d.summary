by @entity0 experts in the @entity2 have warned an assault on a @entity5 power station in april could have been the ' dress rehearsal to a larger terrorist attack '			1
on april 16 , last year , as many as two gunmen stormed the @entity10 substation in @entity5 after severing phone lines and firing several dozen rounds at transformers			1
at least one person , maybe two , went down multiple manholes at the facility in a @entity18 suburb and cut fiber cables leading to the substation			2
attacked : the @entity21 is investigating an april attack on @entity10 's @entity24 substation			1
experts have warned the assault could have been a ' dress rehearsal for a larger attack ' this knocked out 911 and landline service to the power station , as well as mobile phone service to the surrounding area			1
@entity10 employees had no means to call for help when , at 1am , gunmen began their attack			1
more than 100 rounds were fired from high - powered rifles at many transformers â€“ 10 were damaged in one area and three transformer banks in another , a @entity10 spokesperson said at the time			2
cooling oil leaking from at least one transformer bank caused transformers to overheat and shut down			0
this led officials to warn locals to conserve energy , but no major power outages occurred			0
former chairman of the @entity55 , @entity56 , has today called the attack ' the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the grid that has ever occurred '			1
he told the @entity61 he has become ' increasingly concerned ' that a larger attack could be being planned , adding he had decided to go public out of concern that national security is at risk			1
no major damage : transformers were shot at over 100 times , but no serious damage was sustained , nor was anyone injured cables cut : at least one suspect cut communications cables along this highway and another before shooting up the substation energy officials in @entity2 have been concerned for some time that the country 's electric grid could be vulnerable to sabotage			2
the grid is made up of three systems serving different areas of the country			2
in the past small glitches , including trees hitting transmission lines , has wrought havoc on the system , resulting in widespread blackouts			0
in 2003 50 million people in eastern states and parts of @entity93 were left without power for days after a similar minor incident			0
concerns also focus on the fact many of the most important parts of the network are out in the open , often in remote locations , protected by little more than cameras and high fences			0
transmission power stations , like @entity24 , are vital to the grid , making it possible for electricity to move the vast distances needed to serve the entire country			0
the 64 - year - old , who stepped down from his role last november , said he was involved in a series of high - level private briefings with federal agencies , @entity113 and the @entity114 in the aftermath of the attack			1
federal officials took over the investigation from local law enforcement after fears were raised that the attack was linked to the @entity122 bombing a day earlier			2
but an @entity21 spokesman in @entity124 told the @entity61 they do not believe last april 's attack is the work of a terrorist group , adding that investigators are still examining the evidence			1
however some of mr @entity56 's colleagues in the utility industry share his concerns			1
a former official at @entity10 - who own the @entity136 power station - told an industry gathering in november that he fear the attack was a ' dress rehearsal ' for a larger , more catastrophic incident			1
retired vice president of transmission for @entity10 , @entity143 , said : ' this was n't an incident where @entity146 and @entity147 decided , after a few brewskis , to come in and shoot up a substation			1
' this was an event that was well thought out , well planned and they targeted certain components			0
' when reached by the @entity61 , mr @entity143 said he could not expand on his comments at the conference			0
@entity10 spokesman @entity156 said the company take all incidents seriously but would not comment further for fear of giving valuable information to copycat groups			2
he said : ' we wo n't speculate about the motives ( of the attack )			0
' but he added the group have increased security measures in the wake of the incident			2
lit up : the @entity170 sheriff 's office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the @entity10 facility @entity176 flew : no one was injured and the power did n't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run in 2009 a report by the @entity185 said that ' physical damage ' to certain parts of the grid , namely transformers , could render the system debilitated , resulting in prolonged blackouts			1
mr. @entity56 said research by the @entity55 found that it would only take a small number of substations to be knocked out at once to destablise the grid to such an extent that a blackout would engulf most of the whole country			1
but @entity199 , chief executive of the @entity200 , a standards - setting group that reports to the @entity55 , disagreed			2
he said he believes the grid is more resilient			0
' i do n't want to downplay the scenario he describes , ' mr. @entity199 said			0
' i 'll agree it 's possible from a technical assessment			0
' but he said that even if several substations went down , the vast majority of people would have their power back in a few hours			0
a spokesman for @entity212 said it is the responsibility of utilities companies to protect the grid			0
the department 's role in an emergency is to connect federal agencies and local police and facilitate information sharing , the spokesman said .			0

as many as two gunmen stormed the @entity10 substation in @entity5 on april 16 last year
former chairman of the @entity55 commission *branded* the attack ' the most significant domestic terrorist assault on the grid '
@entity56 , who stepped down in november , was moved to speak publicly for fears over national security
he and colleagues believe the attack was a ' dress rehearsal ' to a much larger and more serious incident
@entity21 investigating but say they do not believe terrorist group is responsible
