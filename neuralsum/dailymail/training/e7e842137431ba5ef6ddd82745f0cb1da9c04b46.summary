the @entity0 has been savaged for its ' astonishing ' campaign survey on global warming the @entity0 has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ’ money asking 33,000 people in @entity7 countries how climate change is affecting them			1
the £ 519,000 campaigning survey by little - known @entity11 is designed to persuade the world to adopt more hard - line policies to combat global warming			1
it was immediately condemned yesterday as a flagrant abuse of the @entity17 ’s rules on impartiality and ‘ a spectacular waste of money ’ by a top academic expert			0
every year , @entity11 gets £ 22.2 million from the taxpayer via the @entity22 and @entity23			0
its climate survey , published this month , is called from @entity25 : changing the conversation on @entity27			2
in it , farmers and villagers in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 were asked how climate change was ‘ affecting their lives already ’ and about their future concerns			1
they described less predictable rainfall , droughts , declining harvests and an increase in respiratory disease caused by dustier soil , and blamed them on global warming			0
the survey does not clarify whether these descriptions are supported by data , nor whether climate change is indeed the cause			1
it also includes graphs showing a steep rise in global temperatures – but they end abruptly in 2000 , when temperatures stopped rising at all			0
the report ends with advice , apparently written for climate activists : ‘ do not talk about scientific or technical abstractions			0
talk about the problems they face in their daily lives … speak in language that makes sense to people in terms of how they experience climate change			1
’ @entity11 has a £ 40 million annual budget , and the proportion not funded by the taxpayer is paid by the @entity74 , the @entity75 , and the @entity77 government			0
its website states it ‘ belongs to the @entity0 ’ , and ‘ builds on the fundamental values of the @entity0 to guide its work ’			2
its chairman is @entity82 , director of the @entity83			0
@entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 on @entity88 , said last night he was ‘ astonished ’ to see the @entity0 involved with a survey of this kind			2
@entity86 , pictured , chairman of the @entity87 on @entity88 , said last night he was ' astonished ' to see the @entity0 involved with a survey of this kind he added : ‘ the @entity0 brand carries with it a huge reputation for impartiality and objectivity			2
even though this is not a mainstream , licence - fee - funded activity , for the @entity0 to attach its label to something which is so politically controversial is unwise			2
the @entity0 has already been attacked for paying too little attention to climate change sceptics , and this bears those criticisms out			1
’ @entity105 , professor of economics at @entity107 and a leading authority on climate change impacts , said the @entity0 ‘ would have been better advised to invest this money in proper research ’			1
he said the survey ’s assertions are often contradicted by more reliable sources			0
he said : ‘ objective data do not corroborate the survey ’s reported impacts on health , droughts , predictability of rainfall , and crop yields			0
attribution of any of these effects to climate change is by and large beyond the current level of scientific knowledge			1
’ prof @entity105 was one of the ‘ co-ordinating lead authors ’ of a report on the consequences of warming by the @entity133 @entity132 in march			0
@entity133 figures show harvests have been rising across @entity7 for decades			2
the march @entity132 report stated : ‘ the worldwide burden of ill - health from climate change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors and is not well quantified			1
’ on rainfall , it stated : ‘ there is now low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought since the mid- @entity149 to human influence			0
’ prof @entity105 said the survey results were academically worthless : ‘ interviewing 30,000 people across six countries is expensive , and can not tell us much – previous research has shown people ’s recollection of past weather and climate is very unreliable , and people ’s attribution of observations to causes is worse			2
’ the @entity0 has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ' money asking 33,000 people in @entity7 countries how climate change is affecting them the @entity0 survey ’s campaigning intention is suggested by a chapter entitled @entity172 which tells readers that next year , world leaders will meet at a @entity133 summit in @entity176 to hammer out a new treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions			1
‘ 2015 is a propitious moment for reorienting the way that we talk about climate change , ’ the survey report says			1
the @entity176 talks will ‘ open a window of opportunity … to articulate a climate change perspective rooted in people ’s needs ’			1
dr @entity190 , director of the @entity191 , which argues that the threat from climate change is overblown , said it seemed @entity11 was ‘ the campaigning arm of the @entity0 , [ its ] propaganda bureau ’ and the survey is ‘ a blatant abuse of the @entity0 charter ’			1
a spokesman for @entity201 confirmed the survey ’s £ 519,000 cost but declined to comment on its alleged lack of impartiality			1
the @entity0 has ruled that a radio debate about climate change involving former chancellor of the exchequer @entity209 should have been censored – as he did not agree with flawed global warming computer predictions			1
@entity213 , head of the @entity0 complaints unit , said a radio 4 today programme about the causes of last winter ’s storms should never have been broadcast			2
the move has huge implications for future coverage , implying that ‘ sceptics ’ will be gagged			0
the @entity0 has ruled that a radio debate about climate change involving former chancellor of the exchequer @entity209 , pictured , should have been censored and it has been widely condemned by @entity225 , with @entity226 , a @entity227 member of the @entity228 , saying it shows the @entity0 is ‘ afraid of letting a single critic point out that the climate change emperor has no clothes ’			1
his @entity233 colleague @entity232 said : ‘ this is a form of censorship			0
’ citing the bogus claim that the @entity238 jab causes autism , which was exploded by investigative journalists , he added : ‘ after all , it is often non-specialists who prove the specialists wrong			0
’ @entity209 , the chairman of sceptic think - tank the @entity191 , was invited to discuss last winter ’s floods on the today programme in february			0
the move by the @entity0 has huge implications for future coverage , implying that climate change ' sceptics ' will be gagged the former chancellor often appears on @entity251 to talk about economics , but this was the first time he had been allowed to discuss climate change			1
he argued that there was no evidence to prove that the violent storms were caused by global warming – a conclusion later endorsed by the @entity260			0
however , @entity261 , a climate change spokesman from the @entity263 , complained that the debate created a ‘ false balance ’ between scientists and sceptics			1
and in his ruling , mr @entity268 said : ‘ a false balance should not be created between well - established fact and opinion			0
lord @entity209 ’s views are not supported by evidence from computer modelling			0
’ mr @entity261 responded to the ruling by calling for ‘ necessary precautions ’ to ensure that experts are on hand to ‘ correct any errors ’ if climate change sceptics are allowed on air			1
but lord @entity209 said mr @entity268 ’s ruling was ‘ completely absurd ’ , adding : ‘ the @entity0 ’s position is quite extraordinary			2
they are now saying that only alarmism is acceptable			0
’ and dr @entity287 , head of the @entity289 section , said : ‘ unlike the person who complained to the @entity0 , i do n’t have a problem with @entity209 or anyone else being given air time to voice their opinions			0
