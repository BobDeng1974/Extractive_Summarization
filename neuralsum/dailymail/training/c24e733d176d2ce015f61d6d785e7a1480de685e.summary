by @entity0 an @entity2 photographer has won a prestigious international award in recognition of his beautiful and haunting photographs of the @entity2 landscape			1
@entity7 has been marked as an incredible talent worldwide , in the first inaugural @entity10 competition			1
the images that won him the award feature the stunning landscape of @entity15 , a subject which @entity7 is extremely passionate about			1
' the images are all about looking at what we do as a race to the country , that 's the crux of the images ' he told @entity22			1
' we are mining a pristine , unique wilderness which has spawned amazing ecosystems and animals			0
' ' there is so much apathy in the world , causing problems			2
i wanted these images to be a call to arms for people to question what 's going on get back to looking hard at the world			1
' ' getting technically creative in order to tell a story , that 's one of my favourite parts			2
' despite being so passionate about his work now , @entity7 began his career as a photographer almost by mistake			1
' i was really into surfing in my teens , ' he said , ' and had an accident			0
' ' i picked up a camera when i could n't get back into the water and just started taking photographs of the ocean			2
' ' i started to enjoy the process as much as surfing			0
' @entity53 , @entity54 : ' the images are all about looking at what we do as a race to the country , that 's the crux of the images , ' said @entity7			1
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity15 : this image was shot on the @entity67 @entity66 camera			1
@entity68 wanted to create images that " reflected more than what the eye can see "			2
he " wanted to show the detail that is there but often muffled and confused by lesser cameras "			2
@entity76 , @entity77 , @entity15 : @entity7 said , ' we are mining a pristine , unique wilderness which has spawned amazing ecosystems and animals			1
' after working various jobs until he was 25 , @entity68 moved to the country to set up a dark room , and focused on perfecting the art of landscape photography			2
' i was working all these jobs to support myself			0
one of them was in a picture framing store , and there was a gallery at the front that i rented to hang my pictures			2
' ' they started selling , and eventually someone said that i should photograph his sister 's wedding			2
' ' for years i did commercial and wedding photography , because there was just no money in landscape , although that 's where my heart was			1
' this has n't changed in the intervening years			0
@entity7 , who has been a professional photographer for 26 years now , says that he is still in love with taking photos of what he calls ' altered landscapes			1
' ' @entity111 , industrial landscapes , things that have been affected from mining and the building of dams			0
' ' i would say i 'm environmentally conscious			0
i am drawn to anything affected by humanity , which is just about everything these days , ' he said			0
' i think anyone who is a landscape photographer should care about the environment , almost more than anyone else			1
' ' i 've created a group called @entity126 , which focuses on areas under threat			0
' @entity129 , @entity54 : ' i would say i 'm environmentally conscious			0

' @entity7 said he was surprised when his photographs made it into the final rounds of the international award			1
' there were over 2000 photographs , and looking through them , they were amazing , ' said @entity7			1
' i thought they were so much better than mine			0
' ' i had a couple of images in the top 101 , but did n't think i had a chance at winning , ' ' i was shocked , to be honest			2
it 's quite an honour to win			2
' @entity7 said that the craft of photography has changed significantly since the advent of digital cameras and equipment			1
' when i started out , it was like getting a present every time i got a roll of film developed			2
you could learn all the techniques but there was always an element of the unknown			0
' ' it used to take a lot longer to become a good photographer , and to really learn the craft of it			2
while it 's still hard to master , photography is so different because of the digital equipment , ' he said			2
' there are a lot of photography enthusiasts , which is great , but they 're working on the side of their actual jobs , just selling enough to pay for their equipment			0
this is destroying the professional industry because there is less work , and so many pictures out there			2
' but , @entity7 adds , the increased quality of images is astounding			1
' what people can do now is amazing , ' he said			2
' film is great but it 's nothing like the images we have now			1
some images are almost perfect			2
' ' it will eventually get to the stage where a camera is developed which will be able to see as well as an eye			0

' @entity211 , @entity15 : ' it will eventually get to the stage where a camera is developed which will be able to see as well as an eye			1
' ' a camera is just a dumb instrument , ' said @entity7			1
' it does n't adjust like an eye can			0
but one day it may be able to recreate exactly what we 're seeing			0
technology is constantly changing , and means we have to adapt			0
' ' it 's not always easy to do , but it certainly keeps me on my toes			0
' @entity7 explained that while he will always have a passion for affected landscapes , a lot of the images he takes are to capture beauty			1
' it 's what you would call d√©cor photography			0
the photographs i took in @entity54 are all about showing how grand it is , ' he said			0
' i love finding the best light , capturing trees and fogs and epic locations			0
my whole business is about getting people to buy photos , and most people want to feel good bout the world			1
' ' there are so many terrible things going on , often people want to see something nice and have something beautiful to hang in their houses			0
' the landscape photographer said that it 's this which keeps him passionate and interested in his work , which impacts on every part of his day			1
' no matter how many times you 've been somewhere , there will always be an angle or image that is new			0
being outdoors and on my own in a beautiful place , that 's what i love			0
i 'm a people person but it 's just brilliant , ' @entity7 said			1
' i cant quite explain it			0
i have had a lot of passions in my life but this has always stayed			0
i 'll never stop doing it , everything in my day revolves around it			0
