the left boot worn by @entity1 yesterday is already worth a fair bit more than the one he parted with on the fake farewell last saturday			1
commons , who tossed his footwear into the @entity9 crowd in what was deemed a goodbye gesture , called upon on a replacement set to master @entity13			2
a shoot - on - sight policy that did n’t quite come off when he was the most likely @entity16 scorer in a stodgy first half paid dividends after the interval to help the champions steal a march on @entity22			1
@entity1 ( centre ) put @entity16 ahead against @entity13 and celebrates with his team - mates commons ( centre ) celebrates the winner in the 52nd minute as @entity16 moved three points clear in @entity28 commons ( centre ) shoots at goal for @entity16 in the game against @entity13 in the @entity31 @entity13 : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 79 ) , @entity41 ( @entity40 , 45 ) @entity42 ( @entity43 , 78 ) , @entity44 , @entity45			1
subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			0
booked : kiss @entity16 : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity49 , @entity57 , @entity1 ( @entity58 , 75 ) @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 , 75 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 , 86 )			1
subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68			0
booked : @entity54 , commons goal : @entity1 , 52 his 52nd - minute hit struck the leg of @entity34 for a lucky loop over @entity32 to decide a fairly desperate contest and open up a three - point gap at the top			1
and without the @entity79 target and creative force of the side , curiously withdrawn by @entity82 with 15 minutes left , @entity16 clung on with an extra centre - half in @entity63 to survive some late raids from the host side			1
if that ’s what life is going to be like without commons , then @entity22 will be encouraged for the next four months , while @entity90 will be given a boost for sunday ’s @entity93 semi-final should the 31 - year - old depart this week			0
@entity62 , without a goal since november 30 , and @entity60 , on sunday charged by police for an alleged offence in an @entity100 pub last year , both drew blanks while @entity1 always shaped up like the lock - breaker @entity16 needed			1
@entity16 's players celebrate @entity1 ' strike from range landing in the back of the net @entity16 captain @entity49 ( right ) attempts to score for @entity16 against @entity13 commons ( right ) was denied another goal in the late stages , despite taking the ball past @entity112 ( left ) county boss @entity113 was quick to learn his lesson from the 5 - 0 defeat doled out by @entity16 in october when the champions were four goals up by the 34th minute			1
at @entity120 before the turn of the year he stifled @entity16 in a stalemate and , for the third meeting in as many months , there would be no shame in trying the same tactics			2
albeit minus @entity126 with a torn hamstring , @entity13 ’s solid structure tested the patience and the probing of the visitors			2
only when @entity49 ’s backheel flick to @entity56 opened up an imaginative avenue to goal did @entity16 threaten in the opening half hour			1
commons , however , could n’t keep his back - post header down from @entity56 ’s delivery			0
@entity82 pleads for his team to play at pace but , when confronted by a side detailed to throttle that ambition at source , @entity16 often struggle to scheme at speed			2
the craft of commons helped @entity16 create more menace towards the end of the half			1
@entity35 , just as he ’d done at @entity120 , was excellent in blocking shots at goal and he frustrated @entity1 here			1
@entity151 then conceded a free - kick on the edge of the area and @entity1 picked himself up to force @entity32 into pushing away his dipping attempt			2
they were perhaps fortunate not to be chasing the game by that point			0
@entity56 played the man , @entity45 , at the back post instead of the ball that had pinged back and forth across @entity52 ’s goal on the only occasion @entity16 had to defend deep			1
referee @entity163 rejected those penalty claims			0
@entity52 coughed up a @entity42 drive but there were no takers and @entity169 ’s complaint all day long would have been that his men did n’t counter with much belief after doing the right things when sitting off @entity16			1
striker @entity60 reacts to missing a good chance to score for @entity16 in the first half @entity16 manager @entity82 went over to celebrate with the @entity16 fans after the full time whistle was blown @entity40 , a late first - half replacement for the injured @entity41 , led the @entity178 after the break but the enforced adjustment had little time to take positive effect			1
@entity16 were brisk on the break with @entity1 at the heart of a move that culminated in @entity32 denying @entity60 and @entity187 ’s block stopping a strike from @entity62 on the follow - up			1
the on - loan @entity190 continues to drive his transfer price down			0
after netting 11 in his first 10 games , he went six appearances without a goal before @entity82 kept him benched throughout the back - to - back wins over @entity196 and @entity197			0
eligible to play against @entity198 , @entity62 was salivating earlier in the season about that prospect and the dream of grabbing a hat - trick against @entity90			0
if he can string three starts together right now , that will be a surprise			0
frustration boiled over as he squared up to @entity34 near the end			0
at least that ended in a hug			0
will that be an example for @entity210 and commons to follow over the club ’s contract talks with their star man ? it was no surprise that @entity1 was the spark for the winner			2
his speculative strike from 30 yards got the assistance his gamble required			0
after commons let fly , @entity34 turned his back and the connection from his calf took the ball on a looping passage over his helpless keeper and into the net			0
@entity13 have picked up just one point since their @entity120 heroics and , with @entity39 on for extra presence up top , only came close to snatching another on 80 minutes			2
@entity40 cut inside @entity53 to whip a shot across goal and @entity52 twice denied @entity35 , but they had become daring too late in the day			0
at least that ’s the ast @entity169 will see of @entity16 this season , while their rivals still have the champions to contend with down the stretch of the relegation scrap .			0

it was *goalless* at half - time as @entity13 frustrated @entity16 in the first 45
but @entity1 broke the deadlock with a looping deflected strike on 52
@entity52 made a good save in the last minute to deny @entity254
