@entity0 would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers			1
she might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success			2
at the peak of her career as an @entity9 netball player who won bronze medals at the @entity11 and @entity12 , she earned just £ 742 a month			1
but there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality			1
she is @entity18 's twin and i ask her which of them , back on january 21 , 1977 , emerged first			1
' i do n't think there was ever any way @entity24 was coming out before me , ' she says in a broad @entity26 accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter			2
@entity0 , pictured at @entity29 in @entity30 , is @entity18 's twin and sister to @entity33 @entity18 gives a team talk to her @entity36 players during a match with @entity38 last year @entity9 coach and @entity40 pundit @entity33 poses with his sister @entity41 and her friends it might explain why it is @entity41 who has risen to the rank of national head coach first , taking @entity9 's netball team to this summer 's @entity12 in @entity48 while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting			1
@entity33 has spent the past three years as assistant to @entity9 manager @entity53			1
@entity41 was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in august			1
winning it will be no easy task , even if @entity9 are ranked third in the world			1
they failed to win a medal in last year 's @entity11 and poor results in a recent test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38 - year - old @entity18 , who has performed impressively as the boss at @entity36			1
how @entity9 perform will impact on funding with up to £ 4million at stake			1
she revived an ageing thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two @entity74 titles in three years			2
they are top of the league and later this month will contest their @entity74 semi-final at the @entity78 , with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team			2
like @entity33 and @entity18 , she was first capped for her country at 19 , eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire — and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers '			1
@entity89 's chief sports reporter , @entity88 , interviews @entity18 over breakfast at @entity29 @entity18 , who now works as pundit with @entity93 and the @entity94 , takes a selfie with his twin sister @entity18 celebrates with her @entity36 team after clinching the @entity74 title in april last year ' i think we 're all natural leaders , ' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at @entity29 , which stands next to @entity103 and counts her brothers and @entity106 's other ' class of 92 ' players among its main investors			1
' i 'd say i 'm quite intense , like @entity33			1
he and i would clash quite a lot			2
not to the detriment of our relationship			2
but @entity24 would be the mediator			2
' so @entity18 's the nice one ? ' i think i am , ' she says , chuckling again			1
' i 'm probably not as intense as @entity33 and i 'm not the mediator that @entity24 is			1
i 'm somewhere in the middle			2
i have bits of both personality traits			2
' but i can definitely hold my own with the two of them			2
i 'm probably the one who winds @entity33 up , to be honest			1
being a girl i probably know how to push his buttons			2
' she says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at @entity106 or by the fact that @entity33 's best mate was @entity130			1
' i knew them all when they were earning £ 29.50 a week in digs , ' she says			0
and she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice			1
' we never had those kind of conversations , ' she says			0
' and @entity33 and clothes ? i do n't think they are ever in the same conversation really ( cue more laughter )			1
@entity18 , who will manage @entity9 at the @entity145 , believes she is a natural leader like her brothers @entity33 ( left ) leads @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 ( @entity150 ) in @entity9 training @entity18 represents @entity9 at the 1998 @entity11 in @entity152 aged just 21 ' but we have an awesome dynamic			1
we obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other			0
as kids we were like a pack of cubs			0
we always looked after our own and that 's still the case today			2
we rely on that support system			0
' even as kids , her brothers treated her as an equal			2
' i was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football , ' she says			0
' i was always pretty good at all sports and i would give it my all			0
' i would have been a good footballer			0
my mum was the footballer in the family			0
she played as a striker			0
that did n't rub off because like @entity33 and @entity18 i was a defender			1
in the end the big decision i had to make was between hockey and netball			0
i 'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option i took			0
' understandably , there is what she describes as ' a certain connection ' with @entity191 ' we probably speak more , ' she says			0
' because @entity33 's so busy i would see more of his family , his kids , than i do him			1
' he never talks about himself			0
he won the award last week ( best sports presenter at the @entity197 ) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it			0
he would n't say he wants to be the next @entity9 manager because his focus will be on the job he 's doing at the moment			1
and when i told @entity33 i 'd got this job , it was just a one - word text response			1
' brilliant , ' he said			0
there was more from @entity24			0
' i think he tweeted something			0
' before @entity48 she will draw on the experience of both brothers			1
@entity18 spent a season as assistant coach to @entity218 at @entity106			1
given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of sir @entity221			1
@entity18 would love to have a coffee with sir @entity221 and pick his brains before the @entity145 @entity18 spent last season on the coaching staff at @entity106 , with 10 months under @entity218 @entity18 has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in @entity228 and sports science degree in @entity230 ' if he would n't mind having a coffee with me i 'd love to do that , ' she says			1
' but i 've got 30 minutes booked in with @entity33			1
' there are certain challenges in our sport			0
it 's difficult for the girls to be full - time , and often their jobs become more important because there is n't the financial support			2
' i had some difficult financial times as a player			0
i had great support from my family but i had to take different jobs to support myself			0
' i worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and i studied too			0
i got a maths degree in @entity228 before studying for a sports science degree in @entity230			0
these days i 'm working with girls who are doctors , lawyers , zoologists			0
' but i think i 'm a better coach than i ever was a player			0
one of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way i build a team around a certain ethos			0
i also have a good understanding of the game			0
' the challenge is nevertheless significant , as @entity48 and @entity265 are the powerhouses in netball			1
' the @entity9 target is to get to the final but we 've never made a final before , ' she says			1
' last year we finished fourth in the @entity272			0
the team did n't perform to their best so it 's my job to get them doing that			2
' ideally i 'd like to have had longer to prepare			0
in a perfect world you 'd get a four - year cycle			0
' right now the future beyond the @entity12 is uncertain			0
we 'll just have to see how it goes			0
but i had to take this opportunity			0
i 've always had such passion for @entity9			1
' she 's certainly not alone there			2
lnformation on @entity36 's semi-final at the @entity78 is at @entity289			2

@entity0 is @entity18 's twin and sister to @entity33
she will manage @entity9 at the @entity145 in @entity48 this summer
@entity41 believes her personality is a mixture of her brothers '
she would love to pick the brains of @entity106 *legend* sir @entity221
