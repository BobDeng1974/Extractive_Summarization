a nameless soldier who became an emblem of the bravery and suffering of @entity4 soldiers sent to die in the brutal @entity5 may finally have been identified			1
the young man , who was captured on film carrying the body of a wounded comrade on his soldiers , featured in a 1916 film which showed thousands the true horrors of the @entity13 for the first time			1
he was widely suspected to have died during the war , but a striking photograph has emerged of an army private - @entity18 - who could have been the mysterious figure , and in fact lived until the 1960s			1
the film was an unprecedented success			2
around 20million people are thought to have seen it within six weeks of its release , and although many found the vivid images of war disturbing , seeing @entity4 soldiers in action provided a massive boost in support for the war			2
however , the man featured bearing his fellow soldier on his back wore no identifying information - and the producers of the film did not keep any records of who appeared in it			1
the only note accompanying the scene says that the wounded man died half an hour after the footage was taken			1
but now the mystery could have been solved after claims emerged that the son of a stretcher bearer who served in the battle says that he recognises his father from the footage			1
potential match : this photograph shows @entity79 with his wife after the war , and bears a resemblance to the figure in the 1916 footage generations : @entity87 ( right ) poses with a photograph of his parents alongside his son @entity90 ( left ) war relics : pictured are a war medal and notebook which belonged to private @entity32 according to 83 - year - old @entity87 , the mysterious and heroic figure is in fact @entity32 , a member of the 11th @entity98			1
a comparison between images from the footage and a later photograph of private darkes are strikingly similar - and now the @entity32 family are seeking help from experts at the @entity107 to see whether the identity can be confirmed after 98 years			1
@entity109 , private @entity32 's grandson , said : ' we have papers to prove that granddad was in @entity113 , and we can prove he got discharged in 1917 , after he lost the use of in one arm			1
' my dad always says " i know my own father " and he is happy with that , but to have it confirmed would be marvellous for him			0
' the @entity121 say that his regiment was in that area at the time - i believe there are face recognition techniques that are available today			0
as the centenary of the @entity13 approaches , private @entity32 is not the possible match for the nameless soldier			1
just weeks ago it was suggested that @entity129 , a stretcher bearer in the @entity130 , could be the man			1
his son @entity131 told the @entity132 : ' when i saw the picture on the television i immediately thought " that ’s my dad			0
" ' i am appealing to anyone who has the expertise to help us - we have an old photo of granddad and if anyone could help by comparing the two photographs , i would be delighted			0
' the footage is used in @entity23 , a 1916 @entity4 documentary and propaganda film , depicting the @entity146 in the preliminary and early days of the great battle			1
generals hoped would prove decisive in breaking through the @entity150 lines , but turned out to be one of the greatest disasters in @entity4 military history			0
mr @entity154 said : ' i first saw dad ’s picture in a war programme i was watching about ten years ago			2
i just thought : " that ’s my dad ! " , but i could n’t get a video in quick enough to record it			0
' @entity161 was born on november 19 , 1888			0
he joined the @entity146 in 1914 and died in 1960			0
' he never mentioned the war much			2
he was wounded - he got blown up and lay half - buried in mud for three days until he was discovered			2
' his arm was badly injured , but they said that he was saved from bleeding to death by the mud that congealed over the wound			0
' they saved his arm , but it was never much use to him after that			0
he always said that the government promised them each an acre of land and a cow - but it never happened			0
' however , a spokesman from the @entity107 said it has yet to be convinced by any claims to have solved the mystery			0
a spokesman said : ' we have never been able formally to confirm any of the suggestions made to us of the identity of the soldier in the photograph and as far as we are concerned , the question remains officially open			1
' it appears that there were three men who carried the wounded soldier – the man who approaches the camera was seemingly the third soldier to bear the strain of a fallen comrade			1
' @entity198 , the cameraman who filmed the scene later described how “ a trench mortar man ” and another volunteer made the rescue , but does not say which of them actually carried the wounded man in ; neither does he provide a name for either of them			1
' there are no official records that we have so far been able to trace which offer any more detail than this unofficial account			0
' @entity198 is known to have been filming in the early morning of 1 july in the sector of the front line occupied by the @entity216 , @entity217 , part of @entity219 , facing @entity150 positions at @entity221			0
it is generally assumed that this was also filmed in or close to the same location			0
' as the footage of @entity23 was prepared to be shown around @entity4 - just four weeks after it was filmed on the battlefield			2
it was a huge success , and 20million people had flocked to cinemas to see the footage just six weeks after it was released			2
a single film would not reach so many viewers again until @entity234 in 1977			2
photographs and descriptions of life on the front had been available previously , but this was the first time a moving picture of modern warfare was widely shown			0
many audience members would never have seen a film before			2
at first was feared that the graphic depiction of war might damage morale , but instead the images of brave @entity4 soldiers struggling on the front line brought about a huge swell of support			0
a newspaper report at the time says : ' crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them , and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents , opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in @entity271			1

unknown figure from 1916 footage was serving in the @entity5
footage was made into a film which shocked thousands with reality of war
now family members claim private @entity32 is the man
he was a stretcher bearer in the *gruelling* battle who was later wounded
a photograph of @entity79 shows similarities with the man in the film
the family is seeking help from war experts to confirm the identity
