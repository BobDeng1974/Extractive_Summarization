@entity0 are weighing up a bid in the region of £ 27m for @entity4 star @entity3 as they expect to lose either @entity5 or @entity6			1
@entity8 's @entity7 has also been linked with @entity9 since his outstanding performances at the @entity12 last summer			1
but who is the flying winger who has struck fear into the hearts of so many defenders over the last couple of years ? @entity8 and @entity20 star @entity3 has been linked with @entity0 and @entity9 name : @entity3 age : 26 position : winger teams : @entity8 and @entity20 where do i recognise his name from ? most likely from last summer 's @entity12 in @entity30 and his integral part in that vibrant @entity20 team that reached the quarter - finals			1
while @entity35 was the undoubted star , @entity7 also made a name for himself with his performances of the right wing in @entity40 's team , combining a bold , direct approach , lightning pace and lethal crossing			1
he registered four asissts during the tournament , putting him joint - top of the ranking with @entity49 's @entity48 , who played in two more matches			2
@entity7 celebrates after converting a penalty in @entity20 's 4 - 1 win over @entity53 at the @entity12 two of those came as @entity56 were swept aside 3 - 0 in @entity20 's opening group match and @entity7 also scored a penalty in the third group game , a 4 - 1 win over @entity53			1
and in the last - 16 clash with @entity64 , after @entity35 had scored his award - winning volley , @entity7 soared into the air to cushion a very high cross down for the top scorer to grab a crucial second			2
to followers of @entity72 football , these performances came as little surprise following a stellar season at @entity8 as @entity7 helped them to fourth place and a spot in the @entity77 , realising his potential in spectacular style			1
whereabouts does he play ? @entity7 is a versatile player , capable of performing on either wing			0
he can also fit in as a wing back , right back or even centre forward if required			0
indeed , he played as a centre forward earlier in his career and his idol growing up was @entity30 hero @entity88			0
these days , he is stationed on the right wing as this allows him to inflict most damage			0
the flying winger in action for @entity20 against @entity64 in the last 16 of the @entity12 what are his strengths ? blistering pace is @entity7 's main asset , as plenty of dizzy defenders have found out when it 's already too late			1
indeed , the 26 - year - old was given the nickname ' vespa ' by his former @entity8 team - mate @entity104 because of the ways he nips between defenders like the ubiquitous scooters between cars on @entity72 city streets			1
the right wing is his highway and with his direct approach , close control and accurate crossing , @entity7 would be a real asset for any team			2
his athleticism also enabled him to withstand a fair deal of punishment - defenders do n't take kindly to the type of humiliation @entity7 doles out and , as one of @entity124 's most - fouled players , needs resiliance			2
one aspect of his game that has improved is his finishing , as shown by the 15 goals he scored for @entity8 last season , a three-fold increase on the campaign before that			1
speaking in 2013 , @entity7 revealed how he 'd worked hard at improving this aspect of hs game			0
' i spend hours and hours shooting at goal after training , ' he said			0
' who knows how angry the goalkeepers @entity141 and ( @entity143 ) @entity142 are at having to hang back with me before they 're able to hit the showers			0
' @entity7 holds off the challenge of @entity30 's @entity146 in the @entity12 quarter - final in @entity148 what 's his background ? @entity7 was born in the coastal town of @entity152 , which is one of the oldest settlements in @entity20 , though he was raised further south in the city of @entity157			1
his father , @entity158 , a truck driver , was shot dead when he was just five years old			0
speaking on a @entity4 interview show , his mother @entity159 said he had to be the perfect student in order to play football			2
playing as a forward , @entity7 started out at @entity165 but on the recommendation of the club 's founder @entity167 , he was moved to the wing			0
after a brief spell at second division side @entity171 , where he mostly languished on the bench , he was signed by @entity175 , one of the country 's biggest clubs , in 2008			0
@entity7 scored on his debut against @entity180 and the wheels were soon in motion			0
@entity7 in action for @entity184 during his loan spell at the @entity124 club from @entity188 @entity72 jobs @entity7 only actually spent one season at @entity175			0
he attracted interest from @entity72 clubs and duly joined @entity188 on a five - year contract in july 2009			1
opportunities were initially limited for the 21 - year - old , who made just 12 appearances in his first season and the same number in his second , failing to score a goal in either			1
a change of scenery was probably a good idea and he was sent out to fellow @entity124 side @entity184 for the 2011 - 12 campaign			2
with more regular football , @entity7 started to show his talents , scoring three goals and setting up two more in a season of 33 league appearances			0
it was n't enough to keep @entity184 in the top flight but his performances did catch the eye of @entity8			2
they paid £ 4.5m for a 50 per cent ownership stake in @entity7			0
the winger became a popular figure at @entity184 for his dance celebrations with team - mate @entity221 in his first season at the @entity223 , he opened his account in a 4 - 1 win over @entity226 and finished the season with five goals and seven assists as the @entity230 finished fourth			1
but 2013 - 14 was his breakthrough season , with a string of impressive performances leading to 15 goals and 11 assists in all competitions			1
the most important came against his former club @entity188 in the semi-final , second leg of the @entity240 , securing a 3 - 2 aggregate success and a place in the final against @entity244 ( which they lost 3 - 1 )			0
his profile boosted by the @entity12 , @entity7 has continued to excel and has five goals and three asssits this season so far			1
international honours @entity7 earned his first international call - up for @entity20 a year after his transfer to @entity188 , playing and scoring against @entity252 in september 2010			1
since then , he has been a regular in the side , with 37 caps and five goals to his name			0
celebrating with a spectacular backflip during @entity8 's @entity77 match with @entity259 this season			2

@entity3 has been linked with @entity0 and @entity9
@entity4 winger , who plays for @entity8 , is valued at £ 27m
he made his name with impressive displays at @entity12 last season
@entity3 contributed four assists as @entity20 reached quarter - finals
