@entity0 have confirmed that manager @entity1 will leave the club at the end of the season after an agreement was reached with owner @entity6			1
reports that @entity1 's time at promotion pushing @entity0 were numbered have been around since last week and the club have confirmed that the 52 - year - old , along with sporting director @entity10 and assistant manager @entity12 , will all leave @entity14 in the summer			1
@entity1 replaced @entity15 last season when the @entity17 moved to @entity18 and guided them to promotion from @entity21			2
@entity1 will leave @entity0 at the end of the season @entity0 players mobbed manager @entity1 after @entity25 's goal against @entity26 last week since promotion , @entity0 have been one of the surprise packages in the @entity30 this season and have been pushing for the play - offs			1
but regardless if the @entity32 go up to the @entity33 or remain in the @entity30 , @entity1 will leave the club			1
@entity35 has made the decision , which will be met with dismay by @entity0 fans , following a disagreement over the long - term direction of the club			2
@entity6 said : ' i am a passionate @entity0 fan and every decision i take is intended to be in the best long - term interests of the club			2
@entity0 owner @entity6 has made the decision to replace @entity1 in the summer ' some of the decisions taken to date have been easy and some , like this one , have been extremely hard			1
' under @entity1 's stewardship , @entity0 have achieved a high league position and played football which is a joy to watch			1
' it is difficult to seek to implement change , particularly when things appear to be going so well , but i am single minded in my resolve that we can leave no stone unturned in our quest for sustainable @entity33			0
' innovation , not increased funding , can be the only route to success for clubs such as ours , and i fully accept that innovation is never without risk			0
' we are continuing to build a strong base for the future			0
' everything has been perfectly amicable between all parties and we remain friends			0
' @entity0 lost 3 - 0 to @entity71 at the weekend and slipped out of the play - off places @entity1 was appointed @entity32 manager in december 2013 , moving from his previous role as sporting director , following @entity15 's departure			1
he led them to promotion five months later and their form in the @entity30 has been remarkable - they only slipped out of the top six for the first time this season following a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity71 on saturday			0
that setback came after reports emerged that @entity6 was planning to make the shock managerial change at the end of the campaign despite the almost unprecedented success the unfashionable west @entity91 club have been enjoying			0
it is understood @entity6 and @entity1 clashed in january over the club 's transfer policy , with the manager unwilling to bring in new faces which might have unsettled the current squad			1
@entity6 will now look to appoint a head coach , rather than a manager , who the club crucially say will ' have a strong input into the players brought into the club , but not an absolute veto '			2
@entity1 confirmed there had been a disagreement over ' key philosophical differences ' which could not be reconciled			0
but he added : ' in my remaining time at the club we shall move heaven and earth to get the promotion that the players , fans and @entity6 deserve and going forward , i wish the club every success in its ongoing adventure			0
' @entity12 and i , and indeed all the staff , remain totally focused on supporting this squad of players and ensuring they are best prepared for each and every remaining fixture this season			0
