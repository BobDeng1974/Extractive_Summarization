@entity0 has urged @entity1 to follow @entity3 ’s lead as he attempts to become @entity5 ’s new striking icon			1
@entity1 scored the first goal of his @entity5 career in the 2 - 1 @entity9 success over @entity10 and his manager believes that strike will release the tension that had started creeping into his performances			1
@entity1 scored his first goal for @entity5 against @entity10 in @entity9 @entity0 , however , has made it clear that it is going to take time for @entity1 to fit into @entity5 ’s style of play and if the @entity20 international is to have the same kind of impact as @entity3 , he is going to have to show the @entity24 ’s willingness to put in the hard yards			1
@entity1 will retain his place for saturday ’s trip to @entity29 , as @entity0 feels ‘ perseverance ’ is going to be required as the 24 - year - old adjusts , but he has been reminded that the art of being a successful @entity5 striker comes from the work they do without the ball			1
‘ @entity1 is a boy who has really looked into the history of the club , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he understands the great strikers of the past			0
we ’ve spoken about @entity3 and his time here but if you ’re clever you ’ll remember he ’s still young and still learning the game and he still has this hunger to do well			0
striker @entity1 has been told he must work hard to be a success at @entity5 ‘ he ’ll get fitter and the idea is to persist with him			1
he ’s a good reference for us and he ’s improving with each time he trains and plays			0
it was a brilliant finish and that was exactly what we needed at that time – that bit of genuine @entity9 class and he showed that			1
‘ you saw his work rate			0
he ’s put his body on the line and he needs to do more of that but i think that will come as he gets fitter			2
but he ’s well in tune with the history of the club			0
i think you can see what he ’s trying to put in for the team			2
that ’s going to be very important			0
‘ the crowd demand that as the players who ’ve been here in the past in that position have been non-stop and he ’s becoming attuned to that			0
he ’s aware of the demands and it ’s going to take time but if he continues to score goals and work hard , he will be fine as he has got the quality			2
’ @entity75 has stepped up his rehabilitation from the thigh problem he sustained training with @entity79 a fortnight ago and could be fit to face @entity80 on saturday week , if there are no complications			0
until then , the onus will be on @entity1 to deliver but @entity84 , @entity5 ’s new vice-captain , is confident he will cope with the expectation			1
‘ i thought his finish was outstanding , ’ said @entity84			0
‘ @entity1 led the line and held it up well			2
he had a couple of chances here and there and hopefully that goal will kick him on now and he will get plenty more			0
’ @entity3 was willing to put in the hard yards to be a success at @entity95			1
