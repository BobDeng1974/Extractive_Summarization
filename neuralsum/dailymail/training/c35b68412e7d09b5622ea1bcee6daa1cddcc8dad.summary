there 's a new facial hair fundraising initiative in town			1

one man - 22 - year - old @entity18 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , - even flaunted his @entity4 at the @entity22 at @entity23 in north @entity24 last night			1
the baubles are the brainchild of creative agency @entity44 , situated in the @entity46 area of the capital			2
the agency set up a partnership with @entity50 , the founder of @entity51 - an initiative to raise awareness for skin cancer by encouraging men to grow their beard during the month of december			1
much like @entity0 , when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer , testicular cancer and mental health issues , @entity51 aims to raise awareness of melanoma			1
all proceeds from @entity44 's yuletide facial hair accessory – which cost £ 5 for a pack of 14 – go to the charity			1
mr @entity18 , who recently resigned from his job as a headhunter to return to university to study a master 's degree in finance , said he strongly supported the @entity51 campaign			1
he said : ' i had a cancer in my foot when i was 14 , so i support all the drives like this and get involved because it raises awareness			2
@entity30 were the brainchild of creative agency @entity44 , situated in central @entity24 ' i had a really rare tumour and had to have my big toe amputated on my left foot			0
i was in remission until two or three years ago and then i got the all clear			0
' he said he started growing his beard on september 29 and now hopes to continue growing it long into the new year			0
‘ there ’s nothing to lose getting involved in these things , i like growing a full beard , ’ he said			0
‘ you can raise money for charity , but even if you do n’t , you ’re still raising awareness			1
‘ if people can relate , then it ’s always good			0
’ mr @entity18 , who will begin his master ’s degree at @entity101 in january , said he chose to wear the facial baubles as part of his fancy dress , but also to raise awareness of @entity51			1
he said : ‘ last night was the first time i ’ve worn them			0
a few people came up to me and asked for my picture and everyone wanted to touch them			0
’ @entity44 said @entity4 have been so popular , flying off shelves from the @entity16 to @entity17 , that they had now sold out			2
@entity112 , who works at the agency , said : ' the product has been particularly popular with @entity115			0
' we 've sold more than we ever expected			0
' but @entity17 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity120 and @entity121 customers have been purchasing @entity4 too			2
' each pack contains 14 multi-coloured baubles to attach to beard bristles - ten large balls and four small ones			1
the success of the product grew after @entity44 decided to feature the facial hair accessory in their annual @entity131 cards to clients			2
mr @entity112 said : ' each year , @entity44 makes a @entity131 card to send out to clients and other agencies			0
@entity44 has teamed up with @entity51 , an initiative which aims to raise awareness of skin cancer			1
they money from each bag of the multi-coloured baubles sold goes to the non-profit @entity51 charity ' this year , the creative team , @entity144 and @entity145 , went one step further and came up with a festive gift idea to feature on our cards - @entity30			1
it was a striking image			0
' the craze is n't just a hit with humans either			0
' we 've heard about hairy dogs wearing @entity30 too , ' mr @entity112 added			0
@entity4 have in fact been so successful that they have now sold out across @entity157			2
ms @entity145 , one of the creatives at @entity44 , told @entity160 : ' the interest has been huge , it seems bearded men ( and dogs ) all over the world have been neglected at @entity131 time up until now			0
' we physically could n't make enough @entity4 to satisfy the demand and post them all out in time for @entity131			2
but we 'll be ready next year			0
' because there was still massive interest after we sold out of @entity167 , ​ we decided that we would create some limited edition packs , to raise even more money for melanoma research , and to stretch the skin cancer awareness campaign longer over the festive period , especially in @entity17 where it is summer			1
' all proceeds from the baubles go to @entity51 , a non-profit @entity17 - based charity which works to raise awareness of melanoma			1
much like @entity0 , when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer , testicular cancer and mental health issues , @entity51 aims to raise awareness of melanoma for every bag of baubles sold , the money will go to @entity51 - a charity which encourages men to grow a beard for december			1
men are urged to upload photos of their facial hair to @entity191 using # @entity192 the outfit has been running its december - themed initiative in @entity17 for the last two years , but has become more well - known in the @entity16 since it teamed up with @entity44 's @entity30			1
men are encouraged to grow their beard for the entire month , and upload photographs of their progress – and @entity4 - to social media under # @entity192			1
@entity51 founder mr @entity50 - who is also known as @entity199 - said the support of the initiative had been ' phenomenal '			2
he told philanthropy : ' the real goal of the # @entity192 is n't raising funds , it 's inspiring action , and every day now , hundreds of people are signing up as @entity208 on our website , following us on social media , booking skin checks , and spreading the word			0
' we 've generated millions in earned media , and if we can save at least one life through early detection of melanoma , then it 's all been worthwhile			0
