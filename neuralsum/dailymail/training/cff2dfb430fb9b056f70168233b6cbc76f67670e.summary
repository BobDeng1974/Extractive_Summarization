by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 looks like a footballer , he talks like a footballer — albeit an erudite and engaging one — and his cv would suggest he is a very good footballer			1
he is 23 years old , has been capped by @entity7 at every level , has a @entity10 winners medal and a total of £ 22million invested in him by @entity13 and then , earlier this month , @entity14			1
but for more than two years — since swapping @entity15 for the @entity16 — @entity2 was not a footballer , and upon reintroduction to his profession at @entity21 it showed			1
off the pace : @entity2 struggled on his @entity14 debut in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity21 last weekend , but his manager @entity25 has backed him to rediscover his best form following his move from @entity13 ready for action : @entity2 will likely line up for @entity14 against @entity29 on sunday no @entity10 debutant scored a lower @entity32 merit mark than @entity2 ’s ‘ 5 ’ in the 2 - 2 draw			1
this , of course , comes with an almighty caveat , for @entity2 had not started a league game for 11 months			1
it should sound as a cautionary tale for youngsters lured to the likes of @entity13 , for no matter his talk of ‘ learning curves ’ and ‘ no regrets ’ , here is a player who has stood still in the stands			2
at @entity47 a week ago he looked lost , as if he had forgotten how to perform on such a stage , unable to showcase his ability			0
the accelerated evolution of the @entity10 , of course , means players are quicker , stronger and fitter than even two years ago — @entity2 has some catching - up to do			1
forgotten man : @entity2 was starved of game time during his two seasons at @entity13 faith : @entity14 manager @entity25 believes @entity2 will come good with more time on the pitch international return ? @entity2 is targeting more appearances for @entity7 in the days before the game he had sat with journalists and confidently held court , bullishly declaring he was good enough to play for @entity7 in central midfield or defence			1
his subsequent effort on the field , however , made his words seem premature			0
for now , @entity25 is protecting the £ 10m man			2
‘ this week he has been much better ( in training ) , ’ said the @entity69 , who subbed @entity2 in the second half			2
‘ in the first half , we did n’t help him			0
he could n’t get into the game			0
i took him off when he was starting to influence the game , you can blame me			0
’ @entity78 — the former @entity14 captain who came through the ranks at @entity13 — agrees			1
towering : @entity2 beats @entity80 in the air during last weekend 's match at the @entity83 ‘ @entity2 will only get better , ’ he said			2
‘ he will come good			0
he has not played for a long time and it will take a little while for his timing and fitness to improve			0
‘ but he is young			0
i know people say he has wasted two years , but he would have learnt a lot at @entity13 and he comes here hungry			0
we just have to be patient			0
’ this is the year @entity2 must start playing like the footballer we all hoped he would become .			1

@entity2 looked off the pace on his @entity14 debut at @entity21
23 - year - old moved from @entity13 to the north - east over the *summer*
had started just seven @entity10 matches in two seasons at @entity13
@entity25 has backed @entity2 to improve after more game time
@entity14 host @entity29 on sunday
