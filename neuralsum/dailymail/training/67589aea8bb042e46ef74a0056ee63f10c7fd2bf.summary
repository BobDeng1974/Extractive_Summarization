but a witness then came forward to say he had seen @entity6 with another man the night of her disappearance and the conviction was overturned
@entity5 was convicted again in 2009 but an appeals court threw it out in 2012 when it found problems with the trial ; he was freed on bail
his third trial begins with jury selection this week
prosecutors say he wanted her dead because she was trying to get at his $ 5.4 million fortune during their divorce battle
