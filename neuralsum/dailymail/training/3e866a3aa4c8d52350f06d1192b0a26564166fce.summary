by @entity0 seven - spot @entity3 , feeding on pollen from a cherry flower , now believed to be a more amazing creature than previously thought they may be smaller than the size of your fingertip			2
but when it comes to ladybirds , size is no barrier to might , according to new scientific research			1
experts have discovered the insects can reach the same speed as a racehorse and fly at altitudes close to the height of @entity20			2
for the first time , a detailed study has shown the creatures travelling at heights in excess of 3,600ft and reaching speeds of 37mph			1
researchers also examined the stamina of the insects and found that they were able to remain in the air for up to two hours			1
up until now , scientists believed that anything over seven foot was a long - distance flight for a ladybird - but the new data shows they can actually travel up to 74 miles in a single flight			1
the study of the common or garden ladybird was undertaken using a monitoring device at @entity40 , an agricultural research institution based in @entity42 , @entity43			0
it involved an analysis of data recorded over more than a decade of two species , the seven - spot and the invasive harlequin			0
dr @entity49 , from the @entity50 , who led the study , said : ' when we saw them in the flight cubes , we could barely keep up with them			1
they were so incredibly quick			0
they are very active , fast fliers and are built to fly very well			1
' the recording equipment used by researchers sends radar signals vertically , in a cone shape , to an altitude of almost 5,000ft			0
the harlequin ladybird is one of the most numerous types , along with the seven - spot ladybird , and both share their incredible traits it is able to detect the direction of flight , speed and altitude , of all objects that pass through this airspace			0
it can also detect the size and shape of each item , which allowed the team to tell which were ladybirds			1
while most ladybirds were detected at lower altitudes , between 500ft and 1,600ft , the highest recorded were at around 3,600ft			0
the research , published in the journal @entity86 , also found the average speed recorded was 20mph , although some flew at almost double this speed			0
the fastest ladybirds were seen at the greatest heights , where they were able to take more advantage of stronger wind speeds			2
the monitoring equipment was not able to establish to what extent their flying speed was ' wind assisted '			0
however , high velocities were also observed in a second strand of the research , which involved studying the insects ' flight in a @entity106 box in a laboratory			1
average flight time was found to be around 37 minutes , but to the surprise of researchers , they could remain airborne for up to two hours			2
dr @entity112 told the @entity113 : ' we were expecting them to go for about 15 minutes			0
it means that if they are flying at their maximum speed of 37mph for two hours , they can cover 74 miles			1
whether they are doing that in the field , we do n't know			0
this is another side of ladybirds people do n't see			2

new research reveals tiny bugs do n't care about their size
they *estimate* ladybirds can fly incredibly fast , reaching speeds of 37mph
they can also stay in air for up to two hours , making long distance flights
can travel up to 74 miles in a single flight , according to new data
