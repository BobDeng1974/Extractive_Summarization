mr @entity60 said : ' i do n’t think @entity5 should receive their £ 57 million management fee for services provided to the @entity6			1

however , mr @entity60 said the security giant ’s ambition must be put on hold			0
' before they are awarded any new policing contracts , we need a review of @entity5 ’s ability to deliver , ' he said			0
mr @entity78 and mr @entity60 have stressed that they expect the @entity6 to be a major success despite the problems as the row continues to overshadow the final build - up			1

bright lights : a view of @entity187 as flood lights are tested at the @entity189 ' i think it 's very important that we allow them to try and carry out the role that they are contracted to deliver			0
' but of course the government 's interest , the interest of the @entity6 , the interest of everyone in our country is to make sure that whatever it is necessary to do to deliver a safe and secure and successful @entity6 is done			1
' we 've always had contingency plans in place to deliver just that			0
we activate those contingency plans as and when necessary to do that			0
' but i could n't be clearer - we will do what is necessary and contracts that are n't fulfilled will have consequences , including pretty tough financial consequences			0
' i think @entity5 , in apologising for their performance , have already made clear that they realise that fact			0
' later , @entity34 sought to reassure @entity6 ticket holders from around the world that the @entity6 would be safe and secure			1
when asked at an @entity57 press conference if yesterday 's bomb attack on a bus full of @entity221 holidaymakers in @entity222 presented extra security challenges to the @entity6 , the @entity216 replied : ' obviously we 're monitoring the whole time what 's happening with respect to the changing security situation			2
