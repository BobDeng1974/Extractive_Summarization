by @entity0 published : 22:03 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 2 october 2013 @entity2 great @entity1 has opened up about his beloved wife @entity3 's heart - breaking dementia and how he went to enormous lengths to allow the woman he called ' my bride ' to believe she was healthy until the end			1
@entity1 , 85 , who led the @entity11 to six @entity12 , said he never felt defeated by the challenge of caring for his high school sweetheart without seeking help , services or sympathy as she slowly succumbed to the ravaging disease			1
and a week after her death , though bereft and inconsolable , he has described his bounding love for the woman who bristled at the suggestion she was suffering dementia , and the tear - jerking ' game plan ' he followed - from shipping her car to their vacation home and doing all the household chores - that allowed her to believe , in her own mind , she was n't sick			1
great love : @entity2 great @entity1 , pictured in 2006 , has opened up about his beloved wife @entity3 's heart - breaking dementia and the enormous lengths he went to to allow the woman he called ' my bride ' to believe she was healthy until the end ' my dad provided an environment that allowed her , in her mind , to be a fully functioning adult , ' the couple 's daughter @entity36 told @entity42 as she sat by her father 's side on thursday			1
' it was amazing to watch			2
' @entity1 married the raven - haired @entity46 63 years ago - six months after he graduated from the @entity48 having helped his team win an @entity51 championship			1
he spent his wedding night playing point guard for the @entity11 , which set the scene for how the early part of their marriage would unfold			1
' i was busy playing a child 's game , ' @entity1 said			1
' i thought putting a ball in a hole was important			2
looking back , i should have participated more in the lives of my family			2
but my girls were in the best possible loving hands			2
' however , tearing up , he described how the couple 's romance flourished as they grew older			0
' our marriage was somewhat contrary to tradition , ' he said			0
' most couples have the most intensity in the beginning			0
but i was always working			0
so we had the best and most romantic part of our marriage at the end			0
we literally held hands for the last 20 years			1
' roles reversed : @entity3 , pictured left bringing a drink to her injured husband in 1957 , was cared for by @entity1 for the past decade as her condition worsened @entity84 : @entity1 , top left and wife @entity3 , right , applaud during a @entity86 - @entity11 championship game in 1974 @entity87 is pictured here with daughters , @entity90 , left , and @entity91 during an interview at the family 's @entity94 home last thursday @entity3 began her cognitive decline a dozen years ago , @entity1 told the newspaper			1
she would ask him the same questions repeatedly and grew disoriented , struggling with balance			0
but she always knew her husband , and the fiercely independent woman , who was used to running a household with her husband gone for weeks at a time , refused to believe she was suffering from dementia			1
so , used to ' game plans , ' @entity1 worked hard to create the perception that his bride was still her old self			1
he had her station wagon shipped to their place in @entity112 in the winter because she thought she could still drive			0
he planted artificial flowers in the garden and did all the chores , telling her she 'd done them herself			2
when her condition worsened , the couple stopped socializing and apart from the occasional ' night out with the boys ' or game of golf , he spent all his time alone with his sweetheart , patiently answering her questions and ensuring she had everything she needed			2
' it drew us closer together , ' he told the newspaper			0
' it was never a chore , because i knew she would have done the same for me			0
you just have to go with the flow			0
every three months , i 'd scream out something just for release			0
' sports lover : @entity1 , pictured left in 2007 , and right in 1950 , was always a sports love and spent weeks away from his family while playing legend on and off the court : @entity1 , 14 , brings the ball past a @entity143 defender during a game at @entity145 in @entity146 , march 3 , 1963 during his last appearance in @entity146 as a professional basketball player each morning , @entity1 would wake first and arrange @entity150 's pills , the newspaper , a fiber bar and a banana on the kitchen table before rousing her			1
she would take two or three hours to get through the paper , he said , because she liked to underline every line with a black pen			0
he explained how , after a while , he found comfort in reading between the lines because it was something they shared			0
' she was leading a happy life , ' he said			0
' it was part of the game plan			1
' the routine continued for years			2
but on september 7 , when @entity1 took his wife for an early dinner at @entity173 and on the drive home she suffered a severe stroke			1
she died peacefully two weeks later			0
now , he no longer puts her pills out in the morning or reads between the lines			0
but , as he did for decades before , he still tells his wife he loves her before bed each night			2
it 's hard to entirely give up the game plan .			1
