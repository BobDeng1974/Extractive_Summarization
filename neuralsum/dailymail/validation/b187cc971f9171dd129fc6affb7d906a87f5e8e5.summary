we all have our own ways of dealing with heartache , whether its drinking our cares away with friends , turning to the comfort of our families , or perhaps even buying a sports car			0
but one pensioner took a slightly more unorthodox approach after splitting from his wife by nailing a caravan on top of a motorised catamaran and sailing it around the @entity16 coast			2
the unusual vehicle , which also features a rather flimsy looking safety fence , was last spotted making its way along @entity20 between the @entity21 and @entity23 coast			1
unusual sight : the pensioner has now taken to the water in a floating caravan , seen in recent days chugging along down @entity20 between the @entity21 and @entity23 coast puzzled locals , who have watched the bizarre contraption in disbelief , said the owner is a keen boatman in his ' 70s or 80s ’ and lives in nearby @entity33			1
some residents had theorized that the man built the craft to appease his wife , who was said to hate sailing but love caravaning			0
however a close friend of the handyman said that the couple actually split two years ago , and his friend built the craft as a way of coping with his grief			0
‘ and fisherman @entity45 , 63 , added : ‘ he bought the catamaran and then he fitted the caravan on it and launched it from @entity50 boatyard			1
close - up : the caravan has been fixed to the base of a catamaran fitted with a small engine - and while there is a flimsy - looking fence around the vehicle , there are no other obvious safety measures ‘ he is about 70 or 80 years old and he has got a few yachts and boats in the harbour but for some reason he has obviously built this caravan			1
i do n't know why he has done it			0
' but he loves the water and maybe he saw it as a bit of an escape where he could get away and watch the world go by			0
’ the @entity74 is a 13 - mile channel that separates @entity21 from the north @entity23 mainland , and can be crossed by two bridges .			2
