@entity0 , the @entity1 chairman , has apologised for the confusion over @entity4 ’s condition , and predicted that the @entity5 would race again in @entity6 a fortnight on sunday			1
at a dinner in @entity9 ahead of the opening grand prix in @entity11 this weekend , @entity0 set the record straight after saying erroneously that @entity4 was not concussed in an accident in testing in @entity15 on february 22			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it was not the best performance by me			2
i understand why the press beat me up - for being inaccurate			0
i wanted to be open and honest			0
@entity0 apologised for saying @entity4 was n't concussed when he crashed in testing last month @entity19 @entity4 had an accident during in testing for @entity1 in @entity15 on february 22 ‘ i failed			1
but it is , as always , my objective to try to be as honest as possible in the future			0
‘ there are complexities about concussion			0
it is difficult to quantify , and it goes beyond my area of expertise			0
it is not my decision whether he will race in @entity6 , but as far as i know he will be there			2
i have every reason to believe he will be			0
‘ i spoke to @entity4 on the way to this dinner			2
‘ he wants to race in @entity6			2
i hope he does , but it is his decision , not mine			0
’ @entity4 , here being wheeled away from the crash site , says he wants to race in the @entity6 @entity42 @entity1 boss @entity0 relayed @entity4 's desire to race a fortnight from sunday and says it 's the driver 's choice meanwhile @entity48 ’s penchant for chaos was never better demonstrated than in a bizarre court case unfolding just down the road from the @entity53 track that will host sunday ’s race			1
at issue is whether a @entity57 driver called @entity58 should drive for @entity59			1
subject to an appeal in @entity9 on thursday , he will win that right - a decision that could even mark the end of @entity59 ’s participation in the sport after 22 years			1
this pickle came about after @entity59 seemingly reneged on a contract that said @entity68 der @entity58 would race for them this season			1
they instead hired two drivers , @entity74 @entity73 and @entity76 ’s @entity75 , who between them bring £ 20million to the team			1
but @entity79 went to the @entity80 in @entity81 , clutching his contract			0
@entity57 driver @entity58 has taken @entity59 to court claiming his right to drive for the team they found in his favour , a ruling that was upheld by the @entity88 of @entity89 here on wednesday			1
@entity59 decided to appeal , the result of which is expected on thursday			0
the team ’s lawyers argued that - only days away from this weekend ’s race - installing a different driver was an unacceptable safety risk			2
they said the cars had been fitted to the specifications of @entity73 and @entity100			0
@entity101 told the court that the absence of the correct seatbelt meant @entity68 der @entity58 could not compete safely given the 210mph speed of the cars and g - forces ‘ up to five times their bodyweight ’			0
in truth , @entity59 ’s argument was melodramatic rubbish			2
even if they need to make some late changes , why is it less safe to let @entity68 der @entity58 drive than @entity116 , who was only named as @entity118 ’s driver on tuesday ? @entity116 has never driven the @entity118 car			1
it only passed its crash test last week			0
@entity59 's @entity75 ( left ) and @entity123 wait to se if they will drive in @entity9 this weekend and @entity124 , 29 , was even @entity59 ’s test driver last year			1
no , @entity59 can not afford to drop @entity73 , who is backed by @entity126 , or @entity100 , who brings in a sponsorship package worth £ 10million			1
much of the pair ’s money has been paid up front			0
those backers would not react kindly to being told their man is suddenly out of a job			0
one solution would be @entity68 der @entity58 agreeing to receive compensation , but it is said he would prefer to get the drive rather than the money			2
however , even this is illogical because without @entity59 ’s two high - paying drivers the whole team could be forced into administration , meaning therefore , he would have nobody to drive for .			1

@entity4 could race again in @entity6 a fortnight on sunday
@entity1 chairman @entity0 said sorry for his comments about @entity4 ’s condition following his crash in @entity15 on february 22
@entity0 erroneously said @entity4 was n't concussed in the testing accident
@entity58 's claim to drive for @entity59 could end the team
@entity73 and @entity75 wait to see if they *'ll* drive in @entity9
@entity11 @entity42 kicks off the 2015 @entity48 season on sunday
