@entity0 laughed off @entity2 ’s claim that he hopes @entity3 can catch @entity4 during a spiky press conference after sunday 's @entity7 @entity6			1
@entity8 , who romped to victory at the season - opening race in @entity11 , and team - mate @entity2 , finished more than half - a - minute clear of @entity0 to seal an utterly dominant weekend for the world champions			1
after the race , @entity2 said he hoped @entity3 would be able to bring the challenge to @entity4 , with he and @entity8 expected to dominate this term having won 16 of the 19 races in 2014			1
@entity8 was caught in the middle as @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 traded jibes @entity8 ca n't keep a straight face as @entity0 laughs off claims he hopes @entity3 catch @entity4 this season but his suggestion provoked a spiky response from @entity0 , the four - time world champion who celebrated his @entity3 debut with a podium finish			1
‘ be honest , do you really hope so ? ’ quizzed @entity0 when @entity2 claimed ‘ it would be good if they [ @entity3 ] can come a bit closer ’			1
@entity0 added : ‘ seriously ? you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it ’s going to be closer ? so you hope you slow down ? is that what you ’re saying ? ’ @entity2 responded : ‘ i hope that you can give us a challenge			1
because it ’s important for the sport and for the fans			2
and i do think about the show			2
i want to give people a great time at home watching on tv or at the track			2
if you do come a bit closer , that would be awesome for everybody			2
’ @entity0 points to the crowd as he celebrates his first @entity3 podium on his debut for the famous @entity51 team the four - time world champion finished the best part of 30 seconds behind @entity8 and @entity2 on sunday former @entity54 driver @entity0 then called on his @entity56 compatriot to give him a guided tour of the @entity4 garage at the next race in @entity60			1
‘ you can come if you want , we can invite you , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ ok , thank you for the invite , i ’ll come , ' @entity0 replied			1
the spat continued when @entity0 said it was ‘ a shame ’ that his team - mate @entity66 did n’t finish the race – the @entity68 was forced to retire after his pit - crew failed to properly attach his rear - left tyre during his second stop			1
‘ you find it a shame that your team - mate did n’t finish ? ’ quizzed @entity2 , seemingly still irked by @entity0 ’s earlier interrogation			1
i do n’t know how much you like each other , ’ answered @entity0 in reference to @entity2 ’s relationship with @entity8 , which descended into chaos at times last season as they vied for the title			1
‘ but @entity66 and myself we get along , so i think it is a shame , ' @entity0 added			1
@entity8 saw off the challenge from @entity2 to win the opening race of the new season @entity89 cruises to victory in @entity7 gp q : question to both @entity8 and @entity2			1
we ’ve seen dominance in qualifying , dominance in the race today			2
is this it for the season ? a two - horse race between you two for the title or can you envisage any of your rivals making in - roads into your supremacy ? @entity105 : i think @entity2 was just explaining … i did n’t know , i did n’t see the times or anything but i think the @entity109 have taken a huge step forward			1
it ’s clear they ’ve made one of the biggest steps			2
so we definitely can not back off because i ’m sure they ’re going to be pushing			2
and i anticipate we might have a good fight with them at some stage this year … @entity2 ? @entity120 : i hope we can have a good fight			1
i think the next couple of races we ’re going to be leading the way for sure , and we ’re going to try and keep it that way , but we know it would be good if they can come a bit closer , as long as they do n’t come too close … @entity131 : be honest			2
do you really hope so ? seriously ? you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it ’s going to be closer ? so you hope you slow down ? is that what you ’re saying ? @entity120 : i hope that you can give us a challenge ! because it ’s important for the sport and for the fans			1
and i do think about the show			0
half of me – or a part of me – thinks about the show because i want to give people a great time at home watching on tv or at the track			0
if you do come a bit closer , that would be awesome for everybody			0
@entity131 : first suggestion , if you do n’t mind , i think your garage becomes public for @entity60 and everyone can have a look			0
no ? i ’m joking			0
@entity120 : you can come if you want , we can invite you … @entity131 : ok , thank you for the invite , i ’ll come			0
@entity120 : friday @entity60 , ok			0
@entity131 : engineers ’ room ? debrief , i ’ll be there			0
q : @entity0 , among the races to come , which one do you feel will be the one that is easier for you , for @entity3 to catch up to the @entity4 ? i think @entity60 will be difficult but what about @entity170 or @entity171 ? @entity131 : easy , for us ? i think if you look at the gap , nowhere is going to be easy			1
i think we have to focus on ourselves , make sure that what we learned this weekend we ’re able to take into the next races			0
the most important thing now is that if we finish – we did finish right behind @entity4 today			1
we need to confirm that in the next race , that ’s the priority number one , so we need to make sure that i was not just a one - off			2
as i said , @entity66 did n’t finish , which is a shame			0
we could have scored a lot more points today			0
@entity120 : ... that you find it a shame that your teammate did n’t finish ? @entity131 : yes			0
i do n’t know how much you like each other but @entity66 and myself we get along , so i think it is a shame			0
@entity120 : i though as a racing driver you might like it that you have a couple of points advantage over him now			0
i do n’t want to get you off the foot there , sorry			0
look at him , look at him go ... @entity131 : i can see your point			0
no , no. i can see that at the moment , where we are , we want to make sure we catch you guys and to do that we both need to score			2
yes , i honestly think so and i honestly did n’t want to see the second car not finishing today			0
@entity120 : because i ’m ready for it now , you caught me a bit off guard before but now i ’m ready for it ! teen sensation @entity207 missed out on finishing in the points in his grand prix bow			0
@entity207 , 17 , the youngest driver in @entity211 history , was running in ninth before mechanical gremlins struck			0
he was forced to park his @entity214 after 32 laps , which , in a remarkable coincidence , was the same number his father @entity218 completed before retiring on his 1994 @entity211 debut in @entity220			0
@entity8 ’s win , the 34th of his gp career , means he has won seven of the last eight races			1
it leaves him five shy of @entity0 , fourth on the all - time list , and seven adrift of boyhood hero @entity229			1
it is understood that @entity231 , the @entity232 racer , will not deputise for @entity233 in @entity60 if the @entity68 fails to recover from his back problem			0
‘ @entity231 is our test driver , not our reserve driver , ’ said the team ’s boss @entity235 .			0
