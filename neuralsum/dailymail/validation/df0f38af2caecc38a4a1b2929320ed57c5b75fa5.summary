@entity35 and @entity60 announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage , left , while @entity4 is on trail for his role in the marathon blast on april 15 , 2013 despite getting married and staying together as @entity35 had her leg amputated , the couple have decided to part ways citing irreparable strain , the people reported			1
@entity35 , who struggled her way down the aisle after learning to walk again following the amputation , told @entity111 : ' after the decision was made to amputate my leg in november , i found myself having to make an even more painful choice – to separate from my husband @entity116			1
' over the last several months i 've come to realize that going through such a horrific event together put a fast - forward on our relationship that we each handled differently			1
' while my heart is beyond broken , i have a certain peace knowing from day one , i truly gave it my all , and have been fully invested in keeping this marriage , and my commitment before @entity68			1
' i still love @entity116 with all of my heart and ask that everyone respect our privacy as we try to figure out our next steps			0

they wed in @entity140 , @entity141 , in april last year then moved to @entity10 , @entity11			1
seeing @entity4 in court had helped her realize she is n't afraid of him anymore , wrote @entity9 dear @entity4 , my name is @entity9			1
we do n't really know each other and never will			2
but over the last two years , i have seen your face not only in pictures , but in almost every one of my nightmares			0
moments before the first blast , your stupid backpack even brushed up against my arm , but i doubt you remember because i am no one to you			2
and although i was merely just a blip on your radar , ( someone that happened to be standing 3 feet from your designated ' good spot ' for a bomb ) , you have been so much more to me			0
because you have undoubtedly been my source of fear since april 15th , 2013			1
( after all , you are one of the men responsible for nearly taking my child , and for the permanent image embedded in my brain of watching someone die			0
) up until now , i have been truly scared of you and because of this , fearful of everything else people might be capable of			0
but today , all that changed			2
because this afternoon , i got to walk into a courtroom and take my place at the witness stand , just a few feet away from where you were sitting			2
did you get that ? ) and today i explained all the horrific details , of how you changed my life , to the people that literally hold yours in their hands			2
that 's a little scary right ? and this afternoon before going in , i 'm not going to lie			0
. my palms were sweaty			0
and sitting up there talking to the prosecution did make me cry			2
but today , do you know what else happened ? today ... i looked at you right in the face ...			2
and realized i was n't afraid anymore			1
and today i realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that i needed all along			1
and i think that 's the ironic thing that happens when someone intends something for evil			0
because somehow , some way , it always ends up good			0
but you are a coward			0
a little boy who would n't even look me in the eyes to see that			2
because you ca n't handle the fact that what you tried to destroy , you only made stronger			2
and if your eyes would 've met mine for just one second , you would 've also seen that what you ' blew up ' really did blow up			0
because now you have given me ( and the other survivors ) a tremendous platform to help others , and essentially do our parts in changing the world for the better			0
so yes ... you did take a part of me			0
congratulations you now have a leg up ... literally			2
but in so many ways , you saved my life			0
because now , i am so much more appreciative of every new day i am given			2
and now , i get to hug my son even tighter than before , blessed that he is thriving , despite everything that has happened			0
so now ... while you are sitting in solitary confinement , ( awaiting the verdict on your life ) , i will be actually enjoying everything this beautiful world has to offer			2
and guess what else ? i will do so without fear ...			0
because now to me you 're a nobody , and it is official that you have lost			0
so man that really sucks for you bro			0
i truly hope it was worth it			0
sincerely , someone you should n't have messed with ‪ # ‎ bostonstrong			0
