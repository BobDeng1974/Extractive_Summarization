by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 02:24 est , 17 december 2012 hate preacher @entity1 , who has just moved into a new £ 450,000 taxpayer - funded home , has received more than £ 500,000 in legal aid			1
the vast bill for funding the @entity7 fanatic ’s decade - long legal battle against the @entity9 government was last night described as ‘ sickening ’ by a campaign group			1
justice secretary @entity11 said the payment of such large sums dented public confidence in the legal system			1
the property , let through an agency , costs £ 1,400 a month – paid for by state handouts			2
@entity17 moved in last week after complaining his previous house , in north - west @entity24 , was not big enough for his wife and four of his five children			1
the owner of the new property said : ‘ i had no idea who was living there			0
i have read about this man and why he was in prison , he does not seem like a nice character			0
we signed a contract with the company for six months but there is no way i would have given my permission to rent the house to a man like that – not ever			0
’ sprialling cost : @entity55 has vowed to continue to deport @entity17 , pictured outside his home in november after being released on bail @entity1 's new home in @entity24 @entity17 , once described as @entity61 ’s right - hand man in @entity62 , is fighting attempts to deport him to his native @entity64 where he is wanted on charges of terrorism			1
his removal is being blocked under human rights law amid concerns some of the evidence which may be used against him could have been obtained by torture			0
he was freed from jail on strict bail conditions last month , pending an appeal by the home secretary			1
previous estimates had placed his legal aid bill at less than £ 400,000			1
but , in a written @entity81 answer , the @entity79 revealed that , as of december 5 , the department had provided £ 515,778 in legal aid funding to the cleric			2
ministers confirmed the total cost will be higher , warning : ‘ the legal services commission has not received final claims from @entity1 ’s solicitors			2
’ mr @entity11 said : ‘ we must never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer			1
‘ the total costs in some cases seem very high , and many – myself included – will question whether they provide value for money			2
’ @entity100 , of the @entity101 ’ @entity99 , said : ‘ legal aid is there to ensure everyone has equal access to justice , but it is sickening to see the extent to which this vile hate preacher has been taking advantage of it			1
’ the total public bill for @entity17 is estimated to have now reached £ 3million			1
keeping him in a maximum security prison for more than eight years has cost the taxpayer an estimated £ 850,000			2
the @entity114 has confirmed its own legal bill for trying to deport him has so far totalled £ 825,000			1
@entity1 ’s home is monitored round - the clock by security staff at a cost of £ 100,000 a week			2
in 2009 the @entity121 ruled it was safe to deport @entity17 , but earlier this year the @entity122 said he would not receive a fair trial			2
that verdict has since been upheld by @entity9 immigration judges			0
a satellite dish is removed from the hate preacher 's old home removal men were seen outside the radical cleric 's north - @entity131 home , loading possessions , including a large satellite dish and what looked like a personal cross-trainer , into a van a panel set up by @entity139 to end abuse of human rights law is tomorrow expected to produce a ‘ disappointing and vague ’ report of little use to ministers			1
the @entity145 on a @entity146 is said to be deeply split			0
it contains senior @entity149 and @entity150 figures who are resistant to any serious reform of the last government ’s @entity154 members are understood to be pushing for even more human rights to be enshrined in legislation			0
the prime minister had originally pledged to scrap the @entity159 and replace it with a @entity146 , which would stop the system being a charter for criminals and those who refused to work			0
but , after being forced into a coalition with the @entity150 , he had to downgrade his pledge			0
instead , he established the commission to decide the best way forward			0
@entity167 , who quit the panel in protest over its lack of direction , warned of the likelihood of an underwhelming final product			0
the academic said : ‘ several of my former colleagues on the commission have warned me not to hold my breath and to expect a disappointing and vague report			0
‘ if the commission makes a majority recommendation – as seems likely – that there should in principle be a new @entity9 @entity146 , the report may do little more than set out alternative options as to the contents			0

cost of @entity17 's legal bill ' still rises ' as he continues to fight deportation
justice minister @entity11 questions if cost is ' value for money '
preacher and family move into new rented home in @entity24 but landlady says she will try to evict him
last month he won his latest appeal against deportation on terror charges
