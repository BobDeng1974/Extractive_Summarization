by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor the chancellor @entity2 has seen his approval ratings soar as the economy recovers			2
but experts have warned that a new crash could be round the corner the world economy is as vulnerable to a financial crash as it was before the recession hit in 2007 , the global bank watchdog has warned			1
soaring levels of government debt in @entity14 and @entity15 and easy loans in the developing world have left the global economy in the danger zone , according to the respected @entity20			1
a fresh crash could be devastating for @entity22 - with debt now more than double what it was in 2007 , leaving the government powerless to intervene			1
in 2007 , government debt was just 36 per cent of @entity27 , but has since topped 75 per cent			0
and despite recent falls in unemployment , the number out of work in @entity22 is still higher than before the recession struck			2
the jobless rate has dropped to 6.6 per cent - but this remains more than half a million more than in early 2008			0
unemployment jumped from 1.6million - or 5.2 per cent - in early 2008 to a peak of 8.4 per cent or nearly 2.7million in late 2011			0
but it has fallen rapidly in recent months to just under 2.2million or 6.6 per cent â€“ its lowest level since late 2008 and well below the 7.9 per cent jobless rate the @entity41 inherited from @entity42			0
the @entity43 - based @entity20 said booming economies outside @entity14 and @entity15 were also much more important to the global economy now - so any crash in these countries would have a bigger impact in @entity22 and elsewhere			1
@entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and other booming economies have seen personal debt levels soar			1
their government debt has also increased to an eye - watering 175 per cent of gdp			0
but at the same time , average borrowing rates are just one per cent - encouraging people to take on even more debt			0
the bank 's chief @entity60 told the @entity62 that easy credit in developing countries could hit their economies hard when it comes to an end			1
he said : ' markets seem to be considering only a very narrow spectrum of potential outcomes			0
' they have become convinced that monetary conditions will remain easy for a very long time , and may be taking more assurance than central banks wish to give			0
' he added : ' if we were concerned by excessive leverage in 2007 , we can not be more relaxed today			0
' the financial sector was hit hard in the 2007 crash			1
the @entity43 - based @entity20 has warned that low interest rates in developing countries pose a future risk to the global economy a fresh global crash would hit @entity22 hard			1
families are already mired in debt - as the above table of the top 10 most indebted @entity22 towns shows			2
government debt has also soared since 2007 the bank said the ' ramifications would be particularly serious if @entity49 , home to an outsize financial boom , were to falter '			2
it said : ' @entity96 , in both advanced and emerging market economies , seemingly strong bank balance sheets have turned out to mask unsuspected vulnerabilities that surface only after the financial boom has given way to bust			0
' government debt in the @entity100 is even higher than in poorer , developing countries - hitting 275 per cent of @entity27 , up 20 per cent since 2007 .			1

easy loans in the developing world pose a risk to the global economy
