by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:14 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 20:16 est , 30 march 2013 home to stars : actress @entity4 working at @entity5 on @entity6 the @entity8 ’s closure and sale of @entity10 has been branded ‘ insane ’ after it emerged the @entity11 will continue to spend more than £ 3 million a year renting back ‘ a significant ’ part of the premises			1
last week @entity11 staged a series of lavish goodbyes to the iconic building , affectionately known as @entity17 , which included emotional tributes from star names including @entity20 and @entity21 , a four - hour television special and even a concert by chart - toppers @entity24			2
but far from vacating the premises , which have been the broadcaster ’s headquarters for more than half a century , the @entity8 plans to fork out licence fee payers ’ money to rent back what the @entity11 last night admitted was ‘ a significant ’ part of the 14 - acre site			1
details of the arrangements have infuriated critics who claim @entity5 , the listed building which was home to classic @entity8 programmes such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity6 , has been sacrificed to foot the bill for a series of other high - profile property ‘ blunders			1
’ the @entity8 has spent more than £ 1 billion on a controversial revamp of @entity47 in @entity48 , just five miles away from @entity5 ; while its decision to relocate key departments including children ’s programming and sport to @entity54 , to ensure its shows are less @entity56 , is expected to end up costing just under £ 900 million , including contentious staff relocation packages			1
one @entity8 star , who asked not to be named said : ‘ the @entity8 has had to sell @entity5 to balance the books			1
what other company in the world would voluntarily decentralise from such a perfect location and enter into decades of deal making with commercial landlords			0
’ another @entity8 presenter said : ‘ it is easy to imagine the fun that @entity69 or another @entity8 business reporter would have with a company that sold off its premises in a great media fanfare and then leased them back			1
‘ regardless of doubts about the financial sense of the deal , the decision may encourage the feeling among viewers and staff that this is another example of @entity8 chiefs not getting the best value for licence payers			2
’ private developer @entity84 paid £ 200 million for a 999 - year lease on the @entity87 site last july , £ 100 million less than the @entity8 had initially hoped to raise			1
it plans to develop a hotel , office space , leisure facilities and up to 1,000 apartments there			0
costly : the @entity8 admitted last night it will rent back ' a significant ' part of the 14 - acre site at the former @entity10 as part of its deal with @entity84 the @entity8 has agreed to lease the entire area for the next two years while staff carry out ‘ decommissioning ’ work			1
but even when the new owners take possession in 2015 the @entity8 will continue to rent 20 per cent of the site			2
@entity104 will pay to refurbish and then rent back three studios including the huge @entity106 which is currently home to ‘ shiny - floor ’ shows such as @entity6			2
its commercial arm @entity109 will also move its entire operation to a significant part of the building , known as @entity113			1
in the meantime the @entity8 is having to fork out extra cash to find temporary homes for some of its most popular shows			2
@entity6 is being relocated to @entity119 and later with @entity120 is going to @entity121 in @entity122			0
these type of sale and leaseback deals are usually struck to provide a significant cash flow boost and allow a company to operate from the same premises while avoiding some of the obligations associated with owning the property			0
goodbye ... for now : stars lincluding @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 paid emotional tributes to @entity10 but the @entity8 will be back - at a cost but when @entity5 was initially put on the market in 2007 , a @entity8 spokesman said unequivocally : ‘ this is a full - scale disposal and we wo n’t be leasing it back			1
’ however , the deal struck with @entity84 includes renting 122,000 sq ft. experts say the market rate is about £ 30 per square foot which would leave the @entity8 with a bill of just over £ 3 million a year			0
critics claim the @entity11 would not have had to enter into such a deal had it not overspent on other property deals			0
in 2010 the @entity150 criticised the corporation for embarking on vast building projects without ‘ clear assessments of the intended benefits in terms of value for money			0
’ @entity157 , the @entity158 chairman of the @entity159 , said : ‘ at first sight it is difficult to see how this will represent a significant saving for licence fee payers			0
indeed , i would be concerned that it might actually end up costing more			0
’ a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ the sale of @entity10 has already secured the sum of £ 200 million and will deliver further annual savings of about £ 30 million a year by 2015			0
‘ we believe this to be the best deal for licence fee payers , allowing @entity5 to continue to make an important contribution to @entity176 broadcasting			0

corporation has admitted it will lease back ' a significant ' part of former home
critics say @entity5 was sold to pay for series of other property ' blunders '
one @entity8 star said : ' it is insane '
