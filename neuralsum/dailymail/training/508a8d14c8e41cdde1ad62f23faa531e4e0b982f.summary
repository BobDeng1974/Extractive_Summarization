watching @entity2 train on @entity4 's first day back at work at the weekend several things were apparent			1
one , that @entity4 had lost none of his sharpness			0
two , that @entity2 's intensive passing drills remain a sight to behold			2
and three , that @entity10 looks anything but out of place pinging the ball one touch between the flying tackles , to team - mates @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
song has become a figure of fun since his switch to the @entity24 last summer - last week he even managed to injure new goalkeeper @entity25 in training			1
@entity27 for @entity10 on @entity29 's 1,000th game fooling around : @entity10 ( centre ) play fights with @entity2 team - mate @entity32 ( right ) in training on the move ? @entity2 are looking to offload @entity10 on either a loan or permanent deal this summer preparation : @entity10 has been busy training for the new season but did not play a minute of @entity2 's final friendly it was the first thing of note he had done all pre-season but despite the strange two - year sabbatical in @entity44 it would be a mistake for @entity29 or any other @entity46 suitor to believe he no longer has what it takes for the @entity46			1
the first joke came in his presentation when he was introduced as someone who could operate just as well in the centre of defence as in midfield			0
the punchline was that even he did n't believe that			0
the fact that he could not play in the centre of defence meant he would only make it into the first team ahead of @entity61 and the @entity44 midfielder 's name is practically chiseled in stone in the @entity2 first xi. that remains the case despite a poor season and @entity68			1
on the few occasions @entity10 has played he has done nothing wrong			2
but that is not enough at @entity2			0
doing nothing wrong will not keep you in the team , only doing something spectacularly right will , and he has not managed that			0
favourite : song has found it almost impossible to take @entity61 ' place in @entity2 's starting xi exit : song is not needed after the summer signings of @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 @entity87 tried to , without success , use him at the back , @entity86 liked his strength and energy and even considered playing him and @entity61 in the team but a change of system was too radical an idea			1
now new coach @entity96 has taken a look at his squad and decided he has no use for @entity10			1
the hint was dropped in spectacular fashion on monday night when @entity2 used 22 players and @entity10 was the only one who never got so much as a minute on the pitch in the final friendly of pre-season			2
@entity106 will play again this year and now that @entity2 have signed some central defenders @entity108 can also operate in midfield			2
@entity10 is even further down the queue			0
experienced : @entity10 provided a physical presence in @entity113 's midfield before his move to the @entity24 in 2012 new boy : @entity2 signed @entity10 for Â£ 15million but he has failed to command a regular starting spot since his signing was a mistake			1
@entity2 did n't need him and he has wasted two years of his career but in every training session in that two year period his first touch , vision and speed of pass will have been improved			0
he can not fail to have taken something from 24 months alongside @entity16 and @entity18			2
he remains a fine athlete , a strong runner , a driving force from deep and he has polished his passing on the training pitches of @entity2 's @entity131 , if not at the @entity24			1
@entity46 tested he would not be a gamble			0
he would be expensive , which is why @entity2 are struggling to sell him , but for any team lacking in the centre of midfield , he might just be worth it			0
@entity137 focussed on team performance despite @entity4 debut			0

song is no longer wanted by @entity2 after **joining** the club in 2012
@entity29 is *interested* in signing the midfielder for a second time
the @entity148 star was left on the bench as @entity96 's side beat @entity152 club @entity153 6 - 0 at the @entity24
@entity10 has not played much **joining** @entity2 but he will have learned a lot from the likes of @entity16 and @entity18
he is out of favour after the summer arrivals of @entity83 and defenders @entity84 and @entity85
