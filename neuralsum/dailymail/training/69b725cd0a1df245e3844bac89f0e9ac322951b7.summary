every single major artery on @entity2 's railways will remain closed on @entity3 , leaving millions stranded or pushing them onto the roads			1
no trains will run between @entity7 and @entity8 or @entity9 on the @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity13 mainlines - and the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 lines will also remain shut			1
the near - non - existent service has returned this year despite a fierce political battle over the so - called @entity3 shutdown dating back to at least 2007			1
scroll down to find out which trains will be running leaving the city ? perish the thought - every cross-country artery will be closed again on @entity3 @entity25 and @entity26 have repeatedly traded accusations over the lack of service , which affects football fans , families without cars and shop workers in the @entity3 sales			1
apart from airport shuttles and @entity36 , only @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 will be running any trains on december 26			2
even then the services will be extremely limited and only call at major stations			0
not even the @entity45 train from @entity46 to its largest airport will be running , despite terminals remaining open on @entity3			1
campaigners blamed a ' blind spot ' in the set - up of private rail franchises which puts no obligation on firms to run services on december 26			2
@entity56 , spokesman for the passenger group @entity58 , told @entity59 : ' things need to improve			0
no trains : @entity46 @entity62 is deserted in 2008 due to over-running festive maintenance work ' even trains not running on @entity64 is a relatively new development - i believe @entity67 were running @entity64 trains as recently as 1981			1
' we appreciate it sometimes makes more sense to extend @entity64 engineering works to @entity3 to give yourself a major chunk of time , but we 're calling for more lines to be open next year			1
jams : drivers will be stranded or forced to take to the road to reach family , sales and sports fixtures ' the problem is it 's a blind spot in the way the @entity85 runs its franchise agreement with the operating companies			0
' they 're under no obligation to run on @entity3 and it 's often a loss leader because you do n't have huge numbers of people travelling			2
' he added : ' personally i 'm already down at my mother 's house in @entity98			0
i drove because i did n't want to be stranded , and because i 'm sure the trains will be absolutely rammed to the gills today			0
' despite the complaints @entity3 is traditionally quiet compared to normal commuting days - so many firms are using the opportunity to do engineering work			2
@entity106 station , one of the largest in the capital , will see one of the most disruptive parts of its five - year upgrade this week as part of the £ 6billion @entity114 programme			0
a @entity85 spokesman told @entity59 : ' deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators			0
' but we know passengers want to travel on @entity3 , and that ’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day			2
' @entity127 and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open over the @entity132 period and alternative routes are provided where the lines are closed for essential engineering work , and that these are communicated properly to the public			2
' one group that will be worst - hit are football supporters - with ten major @entity141 fixtures on @entity3 involving some of the nation 's biggest clubs			1
@entity145 fans face a 100 - mile trek to a 3pm kick - off against @entity148 while @entity150 fans will have to travel 150 miles for their club 's draw against @entity153			1
football trip : @entity145 fans face a 100 - mile trek to a 3pm kick - off against @entity148 at the @entity157 ( pictured ) @entity159 chairman @entity158 told the @entity160 : ' this is a ­ significant issue for a lot of fans			1
not just away fans - without public transport even home fans can find a three or four mile journey almost impossible			2
' this is one of the biggest footballing days of the calendar			0
it is a shame nothing has changed			0
' similar chaos in previous years prompted transport minister @entity174 to tell the @entity175 in january there was ' no reason ' why lines without engineering works should n't run			1
while in opposition mr @entity174 slammed the @entity25 government over @entity3 line closures , saying they were ' condemning sports fans and families trying to celebrate the @entity64 period together to misery on our clogged - up motorways			1
' but he was sacked in july 's reshuffle and today @entity25 accused the @entity26 of hypocrisy			0
shadow transport secretary @entity192 told the mirror : ' they had four and a half years to do something about this , but the lack of action shows they never really cared '			0
politics : the @entity3 shutdown has been the subject of party political spats since at least 2007 a spokesman for the campaign group @entity204 said operators often had no choice but to close lines on @entity3			1
' this is nothing new , ' he told @entity59			0
' if the operators did decide to run services on @entity3 that 's usually the period when @entity127 wants to shut the network down anyway for engineering work			2
' the people who are put at a disadvantage are the leisure traveller , such as football fans , who want to travel and come across a lot of engineering work			1
if you are a commuter monday to friday you 're less likely to encounter that			0
' but we have been calling for investment and improvement and the quiet @entity64 period is the ideal time to do that			0
you have to go with the numbers , and @entity64 is a traditionally quiet time ' .			0
