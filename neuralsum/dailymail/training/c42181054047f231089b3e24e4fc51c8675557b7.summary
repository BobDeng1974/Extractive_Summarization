by @entity0 plenty of ancient animals that roamed the earth after dinosaurs became extinct look rather strange to our modern eyes			0
and a newly - discovered ancestor of the cow , which looks a little bit like a super-sized guinea pig with a quiff hairstyle , has been unearthed in @entity13			0
two fossilised skulls of the bizarre bovid were discovered in @entity16 in @entity17 , where a number of fossils of ancient mammals between 23 million and 2.5 million years old have been unearthed since the 1970s			1
bizarre bovid : a newly - discovered ancestor of the cow , which looks a little bit like a super-sized guinea pig with a quiff hairstyle , has been unearthed in @entity13 ( illustrated ) dr @entity27 , of the @entity28 and @entity29 ( @entity30 ) in @entity31 described the new species , called @entity33 , in the journal of @entity13			1
the genus has been discovered only once before , 70 years ago , in northwest @entity13 and the new discovery sheds light on the skull morphology of the group of species			2
@entity41 was a mid-sized late @entity42 bovid living between 11 million and five million years ago			1
it ’s most unique feature is a ‘ horn - core ’ apparatus that has only been seen in this area of @entity13			2
it was first observed by palaeontologists in the 1930s when two bovid cranial fragments with the strange features were spotted among deposits in the @entity53			0
the only ancient bovid in the basin : the sole example of the new species , @entity33 , is a skull with the horn - core apparatus ( pictured ) that was collected in the @entity60 close to the village of @entity62 , as well as a practically full skull of a female with a broken horn the ‘ absolutely exclusive horn - core apparatus ’ of the skulls were deemed so strange they were assigned to a new genus and species in 1935			1
the sole example of the new species , @entity33 , is a fragment of skull with the horn - core apparatus that was collected in the @entity60 close to the village of @entity62 , as well as a practically full skull of a female with a broken horn			1
the creature has a short snout and a high nasal cavity , perhaps suited to living at high altitudes , analysis of the skeleton revealed			0
although @entity41 fossils are ‘ extremely scarce ’ the area in which more could be found is large in the northern part of the @entity88 plateau and could stretch much further afield			0
no relative but a good lookalike : @entity91 ( @entity91 ) which are native to @entity92 bear some resemblance to the ' face ' of the newly discovered ancient species , although they are not related as the capybara is the largest rodent in the world			0

two fossilised skulls of the bizarre bovid were discovered in @entity17 , @entity13 , where other ancient animals have been found
the new species was described by the @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity31
@entity33 is thought to have lived between 11 million and five million years ago at high altitudes
study made this conclusion based on the shape of the creature *'s* nose
the genus has a unique ' horn - core apparatus ' on its skull
