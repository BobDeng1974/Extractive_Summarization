nearly two decades on , sole suspect @entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , has finally been ordered to face a jury accused of killing him			1
charged : @entity2 kitchen fitter @entity17 ( left ) will finally stand trial next week accused of pushing @entity9 ( right ) to his death over the side of a pleasure boat in @entity11 17 years ago @entity20 , 38 , who claims he is a victim of mistaken identity , faces up to 12 years in jail if convicted of mr @entity9 's homicide in a trial starting on monday			1
several @entity2 holidaymakers who were with the pair on the cruise are expected to jet to @entity11 to give evidence , including two sisters who told police they saw the apprentice builder thrown into the sea			0
news of the trial today took the long - standing lawyer of mr @entity9 's campaigning parents by surprise			1
@entity40 , who is now retired , said : ' i spent years trying to get this case to court and had given up hope it would happen after all the setbacks @entity47 's parents have suffered			2
' i 'm delighted to hear it 's going to trial			0
i 'm flabbergasted i had n't been told earlier by court officials			0
' @entity52 authorities have faced criticism over their failure to put the case to rest quicker			1
@entity47 's heartbroken parents @entity56 and @entity58 buried him thinking he had lost his life by accident			0
was he pushed ? @entity47 drowned after falling from a pleasure boat off the coast of @entity11 ( above , file picture ) after he had been taking part in drinking games @entity20 , a father - of - three who was only extradited to @entity52 to face questioning nearly ten years after the incident , was yet to become a father when returned to @entity2 from the holiday immediately after mr @entity9 's death			1
his lawyer said today he had been given permission to return to the @entity2 in 2006 and continue living there while a judicial investigation against his client continued			0
@entity20 declined to comment ahead of his trial insisting : ' my eldest daughter is doing her gcses at the moment			2
' she does n't know anything about this and i do n't want to upset her			0
' mr @entity9 , who lived in @entity83 for the first 15 years of his life before moving with his family to the village of @entity87 near @entity88 , @entity89 , died on november 7 , 1996 after falling from a booze cruise on board a boat called @entity93			1
@entity52 police took statements from holidaymakers on board the vessel , but were quoted at the time as saying they were satisfied mr @entity9 's death was an accident			1
in the dark ? it is not clear if mr @entity9 's relatives know about monday 's trial and plan to travel to @entity11 ( pictured ) an investigating judge ordered @entity20 's extradition after reviewing case evidence			1
high court judge @entity110 approved the extradition request in november 2005 , saying the facts behind mr @entity9 's death were still obscure although it was clear he ' went overboard and drowned ' at some point			1
@entity20 was allowed back to @entity2 to spend @entity115 2006 with wife @entity116 and his children after several weeks in a @entity52 jail			1
he is understood to have agreed to return to the island for monday 's trial voluntarily			0
last night , state prosecutors in @entity52 said they would be accusing @entity20 of wanting to end his alleged victim 's life after drunkenly approaching a girl beside him and asking her : ' shall i throw him overboard ? ' they will also tell a jury at the start of his four - day trial in the @entity11 capital @entity129 that @entity20 threw him a life ring when he saw mr @entity9 was in difficulties and tried to jump in the sea to help him before being stopped by other holidaymakers			1
both @entity47 and his alleged killer had been guzzling alcohol from a funnel during several organised booze games on the cruise before the tragedy			0
homicide , a charge that does not exist in @entity143 law , is a halfway house between manslaughter and the more serious charge of murder which in @entity52 is a wilful killing which must also be premeditated			2
@entity148 two years after his son 's death as well as calling for a 12 - year jail sentence , @entity52 state prosecutors want @entity20 to compensate his alleged victim 's family with € 120,000 ( £ 104,000 ) if he is found guilty			1
it was not clear last night if mr @entity9 's relatives know about monday 's trial and plan to travel to @entity11			2
speaking two years after his son 's death , @entity148 said : ' we wo n't stop until we discover the truth			2
we owe it to @entity47			0
' it only needs one person to speak and the police will reopen the case			0
@entity47 was the most gentle loving and honest boy you could meet			0
' he 'd been looking forward to the holiday for ages , and he rang home to tell us he was having a brilliant time			0
' he said he was going on a boat trip			0
that trip cost him his life			0
' @entity20 , speaking before he was extradited to @entity11 and warned he faced 18 months in jail on remand , insisted : ' i have nothing to hide and am happy to go to trial			1
' but it 's totally wrong that i may be in prison for over a year			0
' his lawyer @entity180 said : ' my client was given permission to continue residing in the @entity2 after being allowed to return following his extradition to @entity52			2
' it 's taken this long to get to trial because of the amount of time the investigating court has spent processing the case			2
mr @entity12 will be flying to @entity11 for his trial			2
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
