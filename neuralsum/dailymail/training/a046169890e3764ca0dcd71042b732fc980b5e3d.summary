it is often said that your name says a lot about you and it 's probably true that people make assumptions about others based on them			0
so how would you feel knowing that your harder - to - pronounce name may affect your credibility ? according to a new study the pronounceability of people ’s names can influence how much we believe them when evaluating their claims			1
credible actress : actress @entity17 poses with her @entity18 earlier this year			0
scientists say that harder - to - pronounce names make people less trustworthy @entity24 - @entity23 @entity22 has said people often struggle to pronounce her name , but whether they believe her or not , it 's not affected her outstanding career the study by @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 in @entity34 , asked undergraduate volunteers to rate the pronounceability of real names from 18 countries across the word			1
based on these results , the team leading the research then made up their own set of difficult - to - pronounce - names , such as @entity44 and @entity45 , and a set of ‘ easy ’ names , such as @entity48 and @entity49			1
the undergraduate participants were then given some straightforward trivia statements , such as ‘ giraffes are the only mammals that can not jump , ’ each credited to one of the names that they researchers had devised			1
the students then had to say whether or not they thought the statements were true			2
the aim , according to @entity59 who reported the results , was to see if the names had any influence over the believability of the statements			2
in their words : ‘ to what extent are our evaluations of people ’s credibility swayed by how easily we can pronounce their names ? ’ would you trust @entity75 ? according to a new study , harder - to - pronounce names make the person less believable does your name affect your credibility ? a study says yes , but model @entity75 , pictured here , certainly has n't seemed to have let that get in the way of her runway success they predicted that those with ‘ easier ’ names would appear more credible			1
and their predictions proved correct			0
the results confirmed that a greater number of statements paired with easy names resulted in a greater number of ‘ true ’ responses			1
if the findings are to be believed , what does that mean for popular celebrities whose names are n’t quite so easy to pronounce ? stunning model , @entity103 , above , who shot to fame in @entity108 ’s @entity107 video last year and is has a role in next year ’s @entity110 , has just been voted fourth @entity111 in the @entity112 by @entity113			1
@entity114 is but a name : actors @entity116 and @entity118 , right , might not be the easiest names to pronounce , but does that make them less credible ? @entity121 actor @entity118 - @entity118 stars in the hot show @entity122 as @entity124			2
his name certainly has n't held back his career , but would you trust him ? she ’s of @entity130 descent and was raised in the @entity131 , and it seems her tricky to say surname has n't set her back so far			0
this year ’s @entity18 saw rising star @entity17 win best supporting actress and @entity116 nominated for @entity137			0
@entity122 heart throb @entity138 has n’t done too badly off his @entity121 name , either			0
he starred in thriller headhunters and is currently playing the leading ladies man in @entity143 , charming @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 in the film			0
maybe complicated names are n’t so bad after all .			0

*universities* in @entity32 and @entity34 carried out research
students were asked to test credibility of statements with a hard or easy to pronounce name attached to them
easier names proved to be more ' believable '
