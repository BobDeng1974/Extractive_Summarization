by @entity0 while her elegant and demure sense of style remained the same , @entity1 let her usual stoic demeanour drop today as she arrived at @entity5			1
the 25 - year - old smiled and laughed while walking into the stadium ahead of boyfriend @entity9 ’s third - round match against @entity10 of @entity11 on @entity12 today			1
keeping her long hair in its straight , sleek style , @entity1 chose a below - the - knee white linen skirt from @entity17 , teamed with a laid - back cropped @entity20 denim jacket , black lace top , and funky leopard - print ballet pumps			0
@entity1 looked unusually cheerful as she arrived at @entity5 to once again support boyfriend @entity9 keeping her long hair in its normal straight sleek style , @entity1 wore an over-the - knee linen skirt from @entity17 once again the artist , who has been dating @entity9 for nine years and lives with him in @entity27 , carried her beloved £ 1,395 cream @entity29 tote from @entity31 , which she has so far brought to every game			1
her cheerful attitude is no doubt a result of @entity9 ’s stellar performances in @entity5 thus far , having won his last two games - the last one in incredible straight sets			2
and , as with most of the tennis champion ’s matches throughout his career , @entity1 has been avidly watching each set from the side - lines			0
despite the media spotlight , @entity1 has not once faltered when it comes to fashion choices , choosing a white lace dress with cork wedges and a block print swallow dress with the same shoes for @entity9 's previous victorious matches			2
@entity1 wears a laid - back cropped @entity20 denim jacket , black lace top and funky leopard print ballet pumps today good luck charm ? as with the last two @entity5 games , @entity1 carries her cream leather @entity59 @entity1 , who @entity9 has praised as a great support , has been highly expressive while watching him play while her ensembles have reflected a cool and together young woman , @entity1 has not been able to help herself becoming emotional as she watches the matches			1
her face has reflected nearly every possible emotion as she gasps and cheers her way through the sets - and today 's game is unlikely to be any different			0
despite his excellent form so far , @entity9 's game against @entity10 promises to be a nail - biting match , with his place in @entity5 - where he is defending his title - hanging in the balance			1
however , despite the undoubted pressure he is no doubt feeling , having @entity1 by his side will be a comfort			0
@entity9 , 27 , has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘ fundamental ’ to their relationship			0
he said : ‘ @entity1 sees all of the emotions when i win or lose a match , she can tell how i ’m really feeling			0

@entity1 , 25 , arrived at @entity5 smiling and laughing today
