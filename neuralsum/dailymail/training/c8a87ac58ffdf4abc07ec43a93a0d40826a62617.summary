practice makes perfect , but only if you go about it the right way , research claims			1
the way a person practices is as important as how often they try to improve - with those who do not cram in sessions but go away and reflect on their mistakes performing better			1
and those willing to experiment and learn from their mistakes at the beginning tend to perform better in the long - run			2
if at first you do n't succeed ... : the way a person practices is as important as how often they try to improve - with those who do n't cram in sessions but go away and reflect on their mistakes performing better researchers followed 854,064 online gamers playing a game called @entity25 , in which players guide a neuron from connection to connection by clicking on potential targets			1
the software was developed by game designer preloaded to challenge people 's perception and decision - making skills while allowing researchers to analyse how practice affects performance			1
they found that some gamers scored higher than others despite practising for the same amount of time			2
game play data revealed that players who seemed to learn more quickly had either spaced out their practice or had more varying early performances , before going on to perform better			1
the study could also help researchers find new ways of understanding how the brain retains information this suggests , the researchers believe , that they were exploring how the game worked and taking the time to practice more methodically and ' efficiently ' than the lower scoring gamers			1
dr @entity61 , from the @entity62 said : ' the study suggests that learning can be improved - you can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level			2
' as we live longer , and as more of our lives become based around acquiring complex skills , optimal learning becomes increasingly relevant to everyone			0
' the study confirms that more practice is better but if you space it out instead of doing it all at once then you improve			0
' also people who are most variable in their performance at the beginning perform better at the end			0
' the reason is that people who are experimenting at the beginning have to make some mistakes in order to achieve success			0
' the study could also help researchers find new ways of understanding the ways in which people learn , as gaming is something that people enjoy and data is easily collected			0
dr @entity61 said : ' this kind of data affords us to look in an unprecedented way at the shape of the learning curve , allowing us to explore how the way we practice helps or hinders learning			0
' the study was published in @entity107 .			0

researchers looked at 854,064 online gamers playing a game called @entity25
@entity113 revealed players who learned more quickly had spaced out practice and made mistakes that they *subsequently* learned from
