by @entity1 reporter published : 23:19 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 5 july 2013 a car company looking to gain an edge in the burgeoning ultra-high mileage commuter market hopes to do so by cutting corners			0
introducing @entity7 , a startup vehicle manufacturer based in @entity9 that hopes to get @entity10 plying the streets minus one wheel in skinny little cars that feature two in the front and just one in the back			1
first , the three wheeled car had to get at least 84 miles to the gallon on the highway			2
second , it could cost no more than $ 6,800			0
it had to also receive a 5 - star safety rating in spite of its size			0
finally , @entity7 ’s car had to be @entity10 made			1
svelte : the 850 - pound , two - seater car gets 84mph and costs less than $ 7,000 , giving buys plenty of reasons not to miss a back tire so far , the three - wheeled car has met those marks			1
weighing in at 850 pounds , the @entity44 ’s svelteness allows it to glide without the need for an suv - sized fuel tank			1
and with five airbags , there ’s little room in the skinny car to hit anything hard once they ’ve deployed			0
unfortunately , the car has lived up to its founder ’s specifications only in the form of a few prototypes			0
inspiration ? the @entity7 mixes the compact size of the @entity60 with the stability and maneuverability of the can - am spyder cycle ( left ) the @entity44 has yet to undergo federal crash test rating			1
that along with some other red tape means the prototypes — which have so far emerged painted shades of silver , black , white , blue , orange ( called creasicle ) , red and bright green — are n’t street legal			0
but @entity7 ’s representatives have been happy to take industry insiders out for a spin			2
soon to come : the car is slated to start being made in @entity78 next summer and interested buyers can put down deposits now			0
the higher the deposit , the quicker they 'll get their @entity7 and @entity7 ’s vice president of marketing @entity84 will soon be touring @entity9 cities in an @entity87			2
according to @entity84 , interested buyers can put down deposits in varying increments , sort of like a @entity91 campaign			0
the larger the deposit , the sooner the buyer will get his or her @entity7 once production begins			2
@entity7 says that will be sometime next summer , when the company will start assembling its three - wheel cars in an old @entity100 plant @entity78			1
colorful : this far , makers plan for the @entity7 to come in blue , black , red , green , silver , and creamsicle ( pictured )			1

makers of the three - wheeled , 850 - pound @entity7 want to get you behind the ( steering ) wheel by 2014
