three @entity0 have been reported to the police after they forced a cat into a tumble dryer and filmed themselves laughing as it was spun at high speed			1
the shocking video shows two women and a man apparently in the bathroom of their home in the @entity11 in western @entity0 's @entity12 , where they are debating about how to dry out the wet cat , which has just been bathed			1
they then raise the lid on the old - style @entity19 tumble dryer and shove the pet inside , with the young woman on camera , @entity15 , 21 , filmed by the other saying that she was going to put it on the six - minute cycle			1
the man , identified only by his first name of @entity28 , and who had stuffed the cat into the tumble dryer , suggests they leave it only for a few seconds as the cat would probably die otherwise			1
after switching the machine on and off , they take the cat out which is so disorientated by the high - speed cycle that it can not even stand			2
they then grab the groggy cat and drop it back almost lifeless into the spin dryer for a second cycle			1
the trio can be heard laughing as the cat at one point falls onto the floor and one of the young women makes a silly face crossing her eyes to impersonate the animal			1
three @entity0 have been reported to the police for cruelly forcing a cat into a tumble dryer she says : ' i wonder what the cat is going to look like when it comes out			1
' the cat , apparently named @entity59 , is dumped on the floor and at the close of the video is seen walking in small circles so disorientated that she can no longer even properly stand			2
the trio then shared the video online on @entity67 's @entity0 social media where it quickly went viral , causing a massive backlash with critics calling for police to investigate			1
the footage was quickly removed after that , but not before it was downloaded by other users and circulated			0
a police spokesman confirmed they were looking into the incident but did not say whether any arrests have been made			0
according to @entity0 media , which did not provide full names for the trio , the cat has been put into a shelter where a new home is being sought for it			1
the cat is held by its front paws and paraded in front of the camera before being put back into the dryer after deleting the video about the incident @entity67 then posted a message on social media defending herself and her friends against critics			2
she said : ' to all those attacking me and my friends let me start from the beginning , do n't believe all the rubbish that you read			2
' it was never our intention to kill the cat and there was no water inside the machine			2
' people who claim to have heard the sound of the cat 's head bashing against the side are talking rubbish			1
' the knocking sound was only the noise of the plastic cover beating against the side			0
' and in any case , the video is now very old and the cat was not harmed			0
in fact it was handed over to another family a long time ago and is perfectly all right			0
' to all those who criticise my family , i say you are disgusting			0
you are talking about me and our parents and yet you are behaving worse than we did			0
' i ask you to draw your own conclusions about that			0
i also want to ask why you are so silent about everything else that is going on , which is so much worse			0
' what about the treatment of war veterans or the murder of people by all sorts of souls			0
why is there no one getting so upset about @entity145 but everybody going on about a cat ? '			0
