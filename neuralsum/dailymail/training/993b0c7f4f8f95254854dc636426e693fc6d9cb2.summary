her ability to seemingly transcend the restrictions of her culture speaks both to her star power and to a certain kind of tolerance toward sexual minorities in this @entity55 nation — and even in the wider @entity56			0
there are references to men affecting the clothes and attitudes of women in the @entity63			0
in countries like @entity67 and @entity68 , while homosexuality is illegal , gender change surgery is allowed , especially for those born hermaphrodites			1
cross-dressing is also often found in the entertainment world and in @entity72 one of the most famous singers of classical music was also once a man			0
@entity76 , @entity10 's hometown , looms large in the history of gender - reassignment operations			1

early talent : @entity10 grew up in @entity103 , one of @entity76 's many sprawling slums			1
as a teenager she was a track and field star , but on the side she was always belly dancing ' gender non-conformity is entertaining and confusing as long as it 's safely confined to a stage or tv screen , not something you meet on the street , ' warned @entity115 , a rights activist with long experience in the @entity56			0
' social prejudice against people who do n't conform to gender norms is very strong			0

she 's even appeared on @entity136 television , with a role on @entity138 back in 2011 , where she taught the aspiring models to dance with a tea set on their head during an episode filmed in @entity4			0
@entity10 does not want to talk about @entity144 , the boy she used to be , for she is now an ' integrated woman , ' she said			1
she referred only in vague terms to her ' history , ' comparing it to the checkered pasts of @entity150 screen sirens @entity151 and @entity152			0
' they tell me my costumes are too suggestive or my past — what past ? we are speaking now of the woman of today , who is an artist and seduces her public , ' she said about the tv executives			0
@entity10 often uses the word seduce , and one point gently tugs down the zipper of her jacket as she says it			2
@entity10 's past is the secret everyone knows but few mention			2
' we accept @entity10 , it is burlesque , a kind of reality and fiction and it plays with the imagination of people , ' said @entity175 , director of the news site goud.ma who has followed @entity10 's career for years			1
' she introduced @entity11 to the costumes , music and choreography ( of belly dancing ) and made it famous			2
' limitations : despite her fame , @entity10 can not get her identity card changed to reflect her new gender and @entity11 state television refuses to put her on air @entity175 noted that there is a tradition of men dressing up as women in small villages to dance , when it was n't considered proper for women to do so			1
