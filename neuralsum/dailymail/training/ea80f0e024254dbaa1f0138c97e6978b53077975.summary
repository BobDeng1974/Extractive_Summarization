the @entity38 politician said : ‘ the fact that recently there have been an increasing number of public lamentations about nude photos of celebrities who took selfies – i just ca n't believe it			2
‘ if someone is dumb enough as a celebrity to take a nude photo of themselves and put it online , they surely ca n't expect us to protect them			2

‘ the person applying to be in charge of shoring up trust in the internet so that @entity24 do more business online just blamed people whose personal data was accessed and spread without authorisation			1
‘ he placed the moral blame for that crime squarely on the victims rather than the perpetrators			1

he claims @entity104 has failed ‘ to act expeditiously and responsibly to remove the images , but in knowingly accommodating , facilitating , and perpetuating the unlawful conduct			0
@entity104 is making millions and profiting from the victimization of women ’			0
mr @entity122 claimed his law firm , @entity135 & @entity122 , first sent notice to @entity104 a month ago demanding the images were removed but many remain on sites like @entity140 and @entity141			0
