by @entity0 published : 03:03 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 06:31 est , 27 july 2012 federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs , known on the street as bath salts , @entity7 and @entity7			1
the operation is the first @entity11 nationwide crackdown on ' designer drugs ' , the @entity8 said yesterday			1
the @entity8 said the haul from multi-agency raids in more than 100 @entity11 cities included 4.8million packets of synthetic cannabis , 167,000 packets of ' bath salts ' and more than $ 36million in cash			1
@entity20 : federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs , known on the street as bath salts , @entity7 and @entity7 @entity20 involved the @entity8 , five federal agencies , state and local police			1
@entity8 administrator @entity28 said in a statement : ' it has disrupted the entire illegal industry , from manufacturers to retailers			2
' together with our federal , state and local law enforcement partners , we are committed to targeting these new and emerging drugs with every scientific , legislative and investigative tool at our disposal			2
' synthetic drugs - with street names like bath salts or plant food - mimic more traditional illegal narcotics like cocaine , lsd , @entity47 and methamphetamine , and have rapidly grown in popularity			1
bath salts have been blamed in several incidents of erratic and violent behaviour across the @entity11 @entity54 herbal blends marketed as @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity55 , and @entity56 and labelled as incense contain illegal psychoactive compounds that mimic @entity59 , the active ingredient in marijuana			1
@entity63 salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such @entity65 or ephedrine			2
@entity63 salts does not refer to a single chemical , but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the @entity11 as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name			1
drugs such as @entity65 are highly potent stimulants , similar to some amphetamines , and in @entity65 's case particularly , cause a strong compulsion to ' redose ' with more of the drug			2
in high doses , such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour , and terrifying hallucinations – and the compulsion to take more of the drug continues , even once the ' high ' has begun to make the user feel bad			2
they have become popular among teens and young adults			0
new research suggests the drug affects the brain in the same way as cocaine			0
the drug 's active ingredient is mephedrone			0
scientists have shown that mephedrone acts the same way as cocaine in the brain - giving it the potential for abuse and addiction			0
studies were conducted on mice using a technique developed in the 1950s - intracranial self - stimulation ( @entity106 ) - that measures a drug 's ability to activate reward circuits			0
in @entity106 studies , animals are trained to perform a behavioural task - pressing a lever or button with their nose or spinning a wheel - to receive a reward			0
mice were implanted with brain stimulating electrodes , with measures of their wheel spinning effort made before , during and after they received various doses of either mephedrone or cocaine			0
dr @entity128 , of the @entity129 , explained : ' one of the unique features of @entity106 is that all drugs of abuse , regardless of how they work pharmacologically , do very similar things to @entity106 : they make @entity106 more rewarding			0
' results of the @entity137 study showed cocaine increased the ability of mice to be rewarded by self - stimulation and mephedrone did the same			0
on july 9 , president @entity143 signed into law legislation passed by @entity145 to permanently ban the sale of bath salts in the @entity11 ' @entity63 salts ' have been implicated in a recent spate of violent attacks across the @entity11 :			1

@entity152 is first @entity11 nationwide crackdown on ' designer drugs '
@entity8 said the haul from raids in more than 100 @entity11 cities included 4.8million packets of synthetic cannabis , 167,000 packets of ' bath salts ' and more than $ 36million in cash
