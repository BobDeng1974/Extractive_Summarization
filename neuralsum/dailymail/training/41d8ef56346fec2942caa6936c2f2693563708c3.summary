this summer 's @entity0 might have added a fourth star to @entity3 's shirts , but it also lost them some of their more experienced stars			1
captain @entity7 , @entity9 's @entity8 and @entity0 record goalscorer @entity10 all went out on the ultimate high into international retirement , taking with them the know - how that comes with 354 caps between them			1
with injuries adding up too , @entity16 gave the chance to some of the next generation of @entity22 stars			2
here 's @entity24 's verdict on how they got on : @entity25 age : 24 position : midfielder ( played at right back against @entity29 ) club : @entity31 minutes played : 90 @entity25 might not initially be considered ' young ' , but he 's pretty new to the @entity22 national side and this was just his third cap - his second since the @entity0			1
@entity29 's mainly defensive outlook , particularly down the flanks allowed the @entity31 man to push forward into the positions he normally occupies in midfield - and it paid off for @entity42 's opener			1
drifting in a cross from deep , @entity25 found @entity42 to head past @entity44 and give the home side the lead			2
and that was typical of his first - half performance , finding pockets of space out on the right and sending balls in to the box with @entity3 seemingly comfortable with dominating the wide areas			0
on the charge : @entity25 took the opportunity to get down the right flank and attacked @entity29 @entity58 : @entity25 slides in on @entity29 's @entity59 as the visitors try to launch a counter attack in @entity62 his passing was perfect - 30 came in total during that dominant first period - and with a 100 % completion rate			2
he even managed a shot on goal but his drive from 20 yards was well saved by @entity44 on the half - hour mark			0
the second half though was a bit of a different story though - he found himself ripped to shreds by @entity29 's suddenly more potent counter-attacking game - and it was @entity25 left miles out of position when @entity59 steamed through down the left to equalise			0
he constantly found himself troubled as the visitors got more into the game and his lack of familiarity with the position perhaps showed as @entity82 grew into the game			0
defensive duties : @entity25 is used to being further up the pitch but did well at the back at times whoops ! @entity82 hares away from @entity25 as he is caught out with his positioning in an unfamiliar role @entity90 age : 22 position : left back club : @entity62 minutes played : 90 @entity90 was another who benefited from @entity29 's withdrawn positioning down the flanks - constantly pressing @entity96 back , restricting his creative skills and giving @entity3 a platform to attack			1
he took his opportunities to go forward and was already setting up @entity42 for a chance just eight minutes into the game with a brilliant right - footed cross			0
comfortable : @entity90 makes sure @entity103 ca n't get a clean shot at goal during the first half and he was able to mix it up too - with a 20 - yard strike troubling @entity44 as @entity29 held firm			0
he cynically brought down @entity110 as @entity29 went in search of a second equaliser and was lucky not to see red - that aside it was a solid performance down the left from the @entity62 defender			2
easy does it : and @entity90 guides the same man away from the penalty area on another @entity29 counter seeing them off : @entity96 could n't do anything to get away from @entity90 on this occasion @entity125 age : 23 position : midfielder club : @entity130 ( on loan at @entity132 ) minutes played : 90 a solid partner to @entity134 in midfield , @entity125 proved an able deputy for @entity22 skipper @entity136 and @entity138 's @entity137			1
he made his first - ever competitive start in the @entity0 final but that ended in injury - on this occasion he was able to play a more active role - sitting deep and sweeping up anything that evaded @entity134 as he advanced through the middle			0
getting forward : @entity125 played alongside @entity134 but still got opportunities going forward good touch : @entity125 takes control and moves away from @entity103 as he performs in the @entity22 midfield pair @entity125 has been linked with @entity151 this week and his performance , adding steel to the @entity22 midfield , might just have impressed @entity155 who is lookign for similar characteristics in the centre of the park			1
defensively he was n't too frequently tested but he managed to see off a few @entity160 attacks early on , nipping in to keep the pressure on the visitors in @entity62			0
careful : @entity125 wins this duel to keep the pressure on @entity29 as they tried to break away defensive duties : @entity125 wins the ball above @entity168 in the air as he won the midfield battle video injuries present challenges for @entity3			1

@entity3 started with @entity25 , @entity90 and @entity125
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 have all retired
@entity16 tried out some younger players in wake of injuries
@entity24 looks at some of the lesser known *members* of their side
@entity25 set up @entity3 's opener but was at fault for equaliser
@entity90 could have seen red for a challenge on @entity110
@entity125 looked neat and tidy in midfield after @entity151 talk
