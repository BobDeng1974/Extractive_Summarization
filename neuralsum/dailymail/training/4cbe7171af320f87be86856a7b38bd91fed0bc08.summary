two goals in the last five minutes from @entity1 and @entity2 helped @entity3 end their torrid run of form in the @entity6 with a 2 - 1 win over @entity8			1
@entity3 had looked destined for a 10th league game without a win , with the @entity8 looking on course for the three points thanks to @entity14 ’s first - half strike			1
but @entity15 conjured up an 85th - minute equaliser - his 10th goal of the season - and then the roof was lifted off the @entity20 as @entity21 also bagged his 10th of the campaign to secure a much - needed win for the @entity25 , while extending @entity8 ’s own frustrating run to one win in eight games			1
@entity2 is mobbed after scoring the decisive goal in @entity3 's win over @entity8 @entity1 draws the hosts level with five minutes remaining at the @entity20 @entity3 : @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 66 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 66 ) , @entity21 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 46 ) , @entity43 , @entity15			1

it was @entity3 who started brightly , with @entity41 agonisingly close to giving them the lead following good work from @entity21 down the left , with the winger ’s shot narrowly clearing the crossbar			2
however , the home side could not make their short spell of dominance count and , when @entity8 were utterly ruthless with their first opportunity of the match as @entity14 put them in front , the home side ’s confidence drained away visibly			1
@entity58 could and should have doubled the @entity8 ’ advantage when presented with a free header at the near post following @entity51 ’s cross , but directed his effort wide of the target , albeit only by a matter of inches			1
@entity3 were looking nervous on the ball , with the mood having changed dramatically in the @entity20			0
they did carve out a handful of opportunities to level before the break , with @entity21 failing to properly connect with a @entity33 cross at the far post and @entity15 sending a dipping 30 - yard free - kick just over the bar			2
@entity14 had fired the visiting side into the lead with only 16 minutes of the @entity6 clash gone but they were half - chances at best and , when the half - time whistle arrived , it was greeted with a chorus of boos from the frustrated @entity3 fans			1
@entity3 boss @entity115 responded by bringing on @entity42 in place of @entity41 during the interval			0
however , it was @entity59 who had the chance to add to @entity8 ’s tally , firing over the bar amid a mad scramble by the penalty spot			1
@entity58 then forced a smart save from @entity32 at his near post with a driven strike that the keeper did well to push away , with the visitors forcing a spell of pressure			2
@entity3 finally began to find some attacking momentum but @entity15 ’s shot , following good build up around the penalty area , was easily charged down and a spectacular effort from @entity21 flew a few feet over the bar			2
@entity15 had a gilt - edged chance to level when substitute @entity42 picked him out at the near post , but his header was off target			1
another replacement , @entity143 , then picked out @entity21 in an identical position , but he failed to connect with the ball completely			0
but @entity3 did finally make the breakthrough with five minutes to play as @entity43 picked out @entity15 eight yards out , and the striker made no mistake as he prodded the ball home			2
and it got even better for @entity3 , as @entity15 then turned provider deep into stoppage time , collecting a fine ball from @entity42 before sending @entity21 loping into the box , where the winger dispatched the winning goal into the bottom corner of the net .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 on target in closing minutes
@entity8 looked set to claim win after @entity14 ’s first - half strike
but hosts *rallied* to end their torrid run of form in the *championship*
