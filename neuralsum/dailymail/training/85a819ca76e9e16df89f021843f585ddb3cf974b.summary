’ @entity9 had last season ’s 26 - goal top scorer @entity63 back after a three - game absence to liven up their goal - starved attack – just four in eight league games now – and it certainly appeared to have the desired effect as they twice went close to taking the lead within the first eight minutes			1
there were less than two minutes on the clock when @entity34 ’s cross took a deflection off @entity47 and looped up towards @entity35 just inside the box			2
in one motion , the former @entity124 player took the ball on his chest and away from @entity73 before letting fly with a first - time volley which beat goalkeeper @entity50 but came back off the underside of the bar			2
then @entity61 thought he had scored his first goal of the season when he tapped home close - range after @entity63 ’s jinking run and low shot had brought a one - handed save from @entity50 , but the big @entity9 striker was clearly a couple of yards offside and it did not count			1
the @entity9 continued to press with @entity34 a constant threat down the right , and it was from another of his crosses that @entity61 headed narrowly over under pressure from @entity73			0
it was a similar story in the 29th minute when @entity61 headed over after great work on the right by @entity35 , but this time he had @entity57 arriving unmarked at the far post behind him and the winger ’s frustration was plain to see			0
@entity9 ’s enterprise and energy kept @entity2 pinned in their own half for long periods , but the visitors did go close twice in the space of five minutes with @entity158 involved on both occasions			1

then @entity77 popped up on the other wing and stepped inside @entity55 before trying his luck from a tight angle with a curling effort that clipped @entity53 ’s far post			0

@entity227 made a surging run upfield and fed @entity71 , and his equally good ball from the right picked out @entity78 who rose above @entity54 to head home			0
that should have knocked the stuffing out of @entity9			0
instead it was the trigger for a stirring fightback			0

@entity63 was inches away from equalising moments later when he met another wonderful cross from @entity34 with a header that flew wide , but @entity2 finally made sure with a third goal in the 70th minute			2
@entity9 boss @entity267 said : ‘ it ’s a harsh reality in the @entity15 that you have to take your chances			0
’ @entity79 ’s header was not quite as impressive as the others as he got in ahead of @entity53 to nod home from close - range after @entity275 had turned @entity77 ’s corner back across goal , and there was still time for substitute @entity62 to hit the bar for @entity9 , but @entity5 wo n’t be complaining as he enjoys that glass of wine			1
