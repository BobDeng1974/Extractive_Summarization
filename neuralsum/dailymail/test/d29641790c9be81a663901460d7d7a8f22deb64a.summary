march was an impressive month for @entity0 and @entity1 as four @entity2 wins from four cemented their place in the @entity5 places			1
and the @entity7 's reward for their good form was another manager of the @entity12 accolade to sit on his mantelpiece			2
@entity0 has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of sir @entity18			1
@entity0 is march 's winner of the @entity20 - his 14th accolade wenger with the @entity23 for april 2002 - when his @entity1 team won the league title a grey - suited wenger with his award from october 2000 - one of 14 he has won at @entity1 @entity0 's @entity20 for march 1998 was delivered in an easter egg 75 - @entity29 52 - @entity30 17 - @entity7 12 - @entity31 9 - @entity32 7 - @entity31 , @entity33 5 - @entity34 4 - @entity35 @entity36 , @entity37 1 - @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 the legendary @entity42 manager was the inaugural winner of the @entity20 when it was introduced in august 1993 , at the start of the @entity2 's second season			1
with @entity42 winning no fewer than 12 @entity2 titles during that time , it comes as little surprise to see the @entity51 top of the list			0
in the 1999 - 2000 campaign , he won it in august , march and april as @entity42 romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006 - 2007 , claiming the prize in august , october and february			2
the last of @entity18 's 27 awards came in october 2012 , not long before he announced his retirement			0
a @entity42 double as @entity18 and @entity63 celebrate their awards in 1996 @entity18 won 27 monthly prizes in all , including this one for february 1997 @entity18 and @entity66 were celebrating in february 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes @entity0 first got his hands on the award in march 1998 and also won it the following month as @entity1 claimed the @entity72 and @entity73 in his first full campaign			1
before this month 's win , @entity0 had last been recognised in september 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth			0
he may have struggled to fill @entity18 's shoes at @entity81 , but @entity82 won this accolade 10 times when in charge of @entity86			1
@entity87 and @entity88 have the monthly award listed eight times on their cvs , while @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 both have six			0
@entity95 may have led @entity96 to two @entity2 titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by @entity99 during his days as @entity101 manager			2
27 - @entity42 14 - @entity1 , @entity102 13 - @entity103 12 - @entity86 11 - @entity96 9 - @entity104 , @entity105 8 - @entity106 7 - @entity107 , @entity108 6 - @entity109 5 - @entity110 , @entity111 4 - @entity112 , @entity101 3 - @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 2 - @entity123 , @entity124 1 - @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 the manager of the @entity134 made a nice desk ornament for @entity86 's @entity82 in september 2004 @entity108 's start to the 2001 - 02 season earned @entity94 the manager of the @entity12 prize @entity87 , then at @entity105 , receives the march 2005 award from his son @entity141 @entity107 boss @entity88 shows off his @entity20 for april 2007 @entity95 has won the prize on three occasions - including here in march 2007 but ' @entity95 ' has n't cleaned up as much as former @entity101 boss @entity99 ( left ) , who won four remarkably , @entity99 was manager of the month in september 1993 , march 1994 and then april 1994 as his team finished sixth before a final award in septmber 1996			1
given @entity18 's dominance , it comes as little surprise that @entity42 come out on top in the clubs list			0
@entity0 's win this month means @entity1 now have 14 overall , the same as @entity102			0
@entity103 are n't far behind with 13 , followed by @entity86 on 12 and @entity96 on 11			0
@entity155 managers dominate the list looking back , with 75 managers from this country having won the prize			0
