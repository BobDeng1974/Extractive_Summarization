@entity1 chairman @entity0 chose to have a private hip operation rather than face the three - month wait endured by health service patients			1
he has come under fire from patient groups who claims he has used a ' fast - track route reserved for those who can afford to pay ' the head of the @entity13 watchdog chose to have a private hip operation rather than face the three - month wait endured by health service patients			1
@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , had the surgery paid for by his health insurance policy earlier this month			1
as well as bypassing @entity13 waiting times – which are the longest they have been for three years – he was given his own hospital room with en suite bathroom and tv			0
his decision provoked fury among patient groups last night , who said it was wrong for a top health official to take advantage of ‘ a fast - track reserved for those able to pay ’ while others were forced to wait months			1
they said mr prior ’s choice to go private showed he had ‘ no confidence ’ in the hospitals his organisation has been charged with improving			1
official figures this week showed that nearly three million patients are currently waiting for treatment – the highest number for six years – with the average delay for hip surgery more than three months			0
as a private patient , mr prior would have been able to have the operation almost as soon as he was referred by his gp			1
the 59 - year - old would have benefited from additional nursing care in a wing partly reserved for private patients at the @entity52 and @entity53 – where he was previously chairman			1
he would also have been able to personally choose his surgeon and consultant			0
critics said his decision to have the operation privately was evidence of a ‘ two - tier ’ health system with those who could afford to pay able to benefit from quicker , safer treatment			2
dr @entity62 , co-leader of the @entity63 , said : ‘ it ’s remarkable that the man in charge of assessing the quality and safety of @entity13 services has just spurned a unique chance of assessing those services for himself from the patient ’s point of view			1
‘ i do n’t know the circumstances that influenced his decision to go private			0
but it appears to be further confirmation that this government ’s policy of running down and selling off our @entity13 is creating a two - tier service with the fast - track reserved for those able to pay			1
’ @entity84 , founder of @entity85 the @entity13 who helped expose the @entity88 scandal , said : ‘ he should be ensuring our hospitals are safe , not going private			0
‘ he should be setting an example			0
it ’s very disappointing and it ’s sending out the wrong signal when the head of the @entity13 regulator feels he has to go private			0
’ mr prior is understood to have had his operation at the @entity52 and @entity53 earlier this month			1
a @entity1 spokesman confirmed @entity97 prior had used his health insurance to pay for the operation but denied he was treated on a private ward @entity103 , @entity104 mp for @entity105 in @entity106 , added : ‘ it ’s hardly a vote of confidence in the @entity13			1
the person who regulates the @entity13 should be using the @entity13 and setting an example to all the rest of us			0
’ in november the @entity1 ’s annual report into the health service said it had found poor care in one in ten hospital inspections – and earlier this month mr prior admitted 30 hospitals were providing ‘ c * * * care			1
’ his private room and care after the operation would have ensured he was far less vulnerable to infections and conditions related to neglect , such as bedsores			0
earlier this week figures from @entity129 showed that as many as one in 16 patients pick up an infection in hospital largely because staff are failing to follow basic hygiene measures such as washing their hands			0
a @entity104 source said : ‘ patients will be worried to learn that people who run the @entity13 do n’t use it themselves			0
‘ they will see it as a sign that prior has little confidence in the @entity13 , not least after his recent calls for privatisation			2
’ since being appointed chairman of the watchdog in january last year , mr prior has been highly critical of the @entity13 and in particular hospital care			1
' patients will be worried to learn that people who run the @entity13 do n't use it themselves			0
they will see it as a sign that prior has little confidence in the @entity13 , not least after his recent calls for privatisation ' - @entity104 source in december he said the health service had become ‘ too powerful ’ to be criticised and said certain areas were ‘ out of control ’			2
and earlier this month he said the care in 30 hospitals in @entity166 was dire and called for greater involvement of the private sector			0
mr prior – who earns £ 65,000 a year – is believed to have had his operation done at @entity52 and @entity53 ’s @entity172 , as this is the only ward in the hospital designated for private patients , as well as teenagers and some @entity13 patients			1
it is not known which insurance firm he is covered by but the largest are @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , with average annual premiums for a 50 - something man ranging from £ 1,000 to £ 2,000			0
the watchdog chief , who is married and lives in @entity187 , was formerly a @entity188 mp for @entity53 and previously served as a director of a steel - making firm			2
he was chairman of @entity52 and @entity191 from 2002 until he became chairman of the @entity1			2
a spokesman for the watchdog said : ‘ @entity0 recently underwent a hip operation and subsequent hospital care at the @entity52 and @entity197			1
‘ he was not treated in a private ward			2
he does , however , have private medical insurance and that insurance paid for his procedure and the subsequent care			2
‘ so he received @entity13 treatment , the cost of which will be recovered from his insurer			0
’ the spokesman later added that @entity97 prior stayed in one of 12 single side rooms off the main ward .			0
