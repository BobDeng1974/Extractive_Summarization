by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 22:32 est , 30 january 2013 the new drug called cerebrolysin improves concentration , memory processing and mood in patients dementia sufferers may benefit from a ‘ promising ’ new treatment made from pigs ’ brains , say researchers			1
the new drug - called cerebrolysin - improves concentration , memory processing and mood in patients with a certain kind of dementia known as vascular dementia , which affects up to 200,000 @entity20			1
no treatment has yet been specifically developed for vascular dementia			1
but the new drug is licensed in some countries for dementia , stroke and traumatic brain injury - although not yet here or in the @entity27			1
researcher @entity28 of the @entity29 at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , said ‘ our review suggests that @entity35 can help improve cognitive and global function in patients with mild to moderate severity vascular dementia			1
’ @entity35 is a drug made from pig brain proteins that has produced some positive results from small vascular dementia trials			1
larger trials are now underway			0
but the drug is not easy to administer , with regular intravenous infusions necessary , says the review			2
the review analysed the most up - to - date evidence from six trials involving 597 people			0
all were given @entity35 intravenously in different daily concentrations and for different treatment periods , from a few weeks to three years , depending on the trial			0
compared to standard care alone or placebos ( dummy treatments ) , @entity35 significantly improved brain function based on testing recall , arithmetic or other cognitive abilities			0
it had a small positive effect on patients ’ overall clinical state and mood			2
long - term treatment may have greater benefits , although most of the trials were short			0
vascular dementia is a common form of dementia caused by damage to the network of blood vessels supplying the brain affecting up to one in four of 800,000 dementia sufferers in the @entity20			1
some symptoms are similar to alzheimer ’s disease and stroke but people with vascular dementia often experience difficulty thinking quickly , concentrating and communicating , as well as seizures and severe confusion			1
dr @entity28 said : ‘ the results are promising but due to low numbers of trials , inconsistencies between trials , risk of bias in the way some of the trials were conducted and lack of long - term follow - up , we can not yet recommend @entity35 as a routine treatment for vascular dementia			1
’ no serious side effects were reported due to taking the drug			1
dr @entity28 said ‘ this indicates to us that @entity35 is safe and well tolerated by patients with vascular dementia			1
but the fact that it has to be given in regular intravenous infusions means it could be impractical for use on a large scale			0
’ the director of research at @entity106 said developments in new research was ' absolutely vital ' dr @entity109 , director of research at @entity111 , said ‘ @entity113 systematic reviews are an incredibly valuable tool , as they pull together the best available evidence on a particular treatment or intervention			0
‘ this review found that @entity35 does appear to have some cognitive benefits for people with vascular dementia , although it is not clear how these might translate into day - to - day improvements in people ’s lives			2
‘ it is positive to see potential new treatments tested in people , but larger clinical trials are needed before we could know whether @entity35 could be a feasible treatment option for people with the condition			0
‘ vascular dementia affects thousands of people in the @entity20 , but sadly there are no specific treatments available for people with the condition			1
research into new treatments is absolutely vital , but without continued investment , promising findings can not be taken forward			0
we must ensure that research into dementia remains a national priority			0
’ @entity143 , research officer at the @entity144 , said ‘ this review is interesting but highlights the lack of research into vascular dementia			2
if we are to really understand whether @entity35 can be potentially be used to treat people more research is needed into its long term effects			0
‘ vascular dementia is the second most common form of the condition affecting around a quarter of all people with dementia			2
' while other forms of dementia have seen progress in research , there is currently no treatment for vascular dementia			2
‘ we desperately need more research and more funding for research if we are to develop effective interventions for all forms of dementia			0

the new drug called cerebrolysin improves concentration , memory and mood among those suffering with vascular dementia
the new drug is licensed in some countries but not in the @entity20 or @entity27
no serious side effects were reported from taking the drug
