the bizarre running of @entity1 plunged to new depths on tuesday night as @entity4 manager @entity3 rejected the club ’s advances - despite there being no official vacancy			1
chairman @entity9 is primed to sack @entity10 after just three months in charge and had identified @entity12 as the perfect successor			1
the former @entity15 boss turned down the opportunity after disagreements over a five - figure agent fee , meaning the @entity19 turned to @entity3			1
@entity10 had looked like being sacked over the weekend but took training on monday and tuesday before talks with @entity37			2
the club are ready to dispense with his services as soon as they manage to find a man willing to work for the club			0
@entity3 was n't prepared to do so , with @entity24 confirming the news on their @entity28 account			0
' following discussions with @entity1 , i have decided that i will remain at @entity4 for the foreseeable future , ' he told the club 's website			2
' i feel as though it is not the right job for me at the present time			0
' we ’ve made an excellent start to this season , winning seven out of eight games and i feel we have an excellent group of players in the squad currently			0
i enjoy working with them immensely and this is a very exciting time to be involved at @entity4			2
' heading for the exit : @entity10 's turbulent @entity65 tenure is set to be ended @entity1 heralded a new era at @entity65 as @entity10 jetted in , labelling it the ‘ @entity68 ’			1
that , however , has n’t been allowed to happen after sustained bickering and fallouts between the @entity72 and @entity37			0
the pair never saw eye - to - eye from day one , @entity75 crying broken promises and @entity34 questioning his manager ’s motives at every turn			1
it meant @entity1 - who were in the top half of the @entity84 this time four years ago - lost their opening six competitive fixtures of the season and barely have a squad to show for a summer of laughable recruitment			2
@entity10 was forced to train with fewer than 11 players for the majority of pre-season and failed to land most of his top targets			0
@entity9 did n’t agree with some of the fees banded about for foreign imports			0
man at the top : @entity1 chairman @entity9 is poised to wield the axe the situation has since escalated - @entity34 using his column in the town ’s local newspaper to attack his own manager - and it appeared @entity75 would be sacked over the weekend			1
the chairman said he was left ‘ bemused ’ at the @entity72 ’s decision to take a week ’s holiday back home over the international break , claiming he did n’t inform anybody at the club			0
@entity9 had in fact set the wheels in motion for @entity75 ’s sacking weeks ago but now faces trying to find a new man quickly or promote from within - former @entity117 under 19s coach @entity116 being the likely beneficiary .			1

@entity4 chief rejects @entity19 - despite there being no official vacancy
@entity75 is set to be axed as manager after just three months in charge
@entity12 recently snubbed the chance to take over at @entity65
