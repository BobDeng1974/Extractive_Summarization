the businessman whose dispute with a fellow airline passenger over a reclined seat sparked a fight and force his flight to divert says he 's embarrassed by the way the confrontation unfolded and that he regrets his behavior			1
but do n't expect @entity11 to stop using the @entity12 , a $ 22 gadget that attaches to a passenger 's tray table and prevents the person in front from reclining			1
he just plans to be nicer about it - and insists that passengers who recline their seats are ' rude '			2
' i 'm pretty ashamed and embarrassed by what happened , ' @entity11 said on wednesday			0
' i could have handled it so much better			0
' the argument became so tense that the pilots of the aug. 24 @entity26 to @entity28 flight diverted the @entity29 to @entity30			1
in the days that followed , two other flights were diverted under similar circumstances			0
@entity11 , 48 , clarified a few things about the episode , primarily that he initially complied with flight attendant instructions to remove the device			1
for the record , he said , he never reclines his seat			0
' you have the right , but it seems rude to do it , ' said @entity11 , who is 6 feet 1 inch tall			0
the dispute occurred on the final leg of @entity56 's trip back to his home near @entity28			1
after returning to the @entity58 from a business trip to @entity60 , he went on standby for an earlier flight for the leg from @entity26 , @entity63 , to @entity28 and was given a middle seat			1
locked and loaded : most airlines prohibit the use the of the @entity12 , @entity11 used one so he could continue working on his laptop when the jet was airborne , @entity11 took out his laptop to review a contract for his company , which develops waste recycling facilities , primarily in @entity72			1
he used the knee defender — a @entity75 gift a few years ago from his wife — to prevent the woman in front from reclining			2
@entity58 airlines prohibit use of the @entity12 , but the devices are not illegal			2
' i put them in maybe a third of the time			0
usually , the person in front tries ( to recline ) their seat a couple of times , and then they forget about it , ' @entity11 said			2
the device comes with a courtesy card to tell passengers that you 've blocked them , but he does n't use it			2
' i 'd rather just kind of let them think the seat is broken , rather than start a confrontation , ' he said			0
@entity11 , who said he flies 75,000 to 100,000 miles a year , was n't so lucky this time			0
when the flight attendants came through the cabin to serve beverages , the woman said her seat was broken			1
that 's when @entity11 told one of them about the @entity12			1
the flight attendant asked him to remove the device , and @entity11 said he did			2
' as soon as i started to move it , she just full force , blasted the seat back , right on the laptop , almost shattered the screen			1
my laptop came flying onto my lap , ' he said			0
tiny : the @entity12 , which is about the size of a house key , retails for about $ 19.95 , but is banned by all major @entity58 airlines @entity11 complained , saying that he could n't work like that , but the flight attendant informed him that the woman had the right to recline			1
both passengers were sitting in @entity131 's @entity130 section , which offers 4 more inches of legroom than the rest of coach			1
his reply : ' you asked me to let her recline a few inches , and she just took 100 percent of it			0
' that 's when @entity56 's anger boiled over			0
he said he pushed the woman 's seat forward and put the @entity12 back in			1
the woman stood up and threw a cup of soda — not water , as previously reported — at him			1
' it was really just surreal and shocking			0
did that just happen ? ' @entity11 recalls			0
' i said , ' i hope you brought your checkbook because you just threw your @entity157 all over my $ 2,000 laptop			1
'' the flight attendant stepped in quickly and moved the woman to another seat			1
' i said a lot of things i should n't have said to the flight attendant : some bad words , what 's your name and ' i ca n't believe you 're treating me like this , '' he recalled			0
the pilots then changed course for @entity30 — a decision that @entity11 said ' amazed ' him			2
' the plane was dead quiet for the rest of that flight , ' he added			2
' nobody said a word			0
' @entity180 , who invented the @entity12 , said the passengers on the other diverted flights got upset after their knees and head were hit by reclining seats			1
he said airlines are ' trying to wish this problem away			0
' his solution : install seats that slide forward within a shell to recline or to allow the use of his device , which has been sold since 2003			0
' they 're selling the same space twice — to me to sit down and then inviting people to put their seat backs there as well , ' he said			0
when the plane landed in @entity30 , police escorted @entity56 and the woman off			1
neither police , nor the airline or the @entity205 has released any information about the passenger seated in front of @entity56			2
no criminal or civil charges were brought against them , but @entity131 would not let them continue on to @entity28			1
@entity11 says he spent the night at an airport hotel and then caught a flight home the next morning			0
it has no reclining seats .			0
