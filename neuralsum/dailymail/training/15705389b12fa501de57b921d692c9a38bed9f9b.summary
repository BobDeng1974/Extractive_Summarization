sorry : @entity0 , the country 's most senior law officer , has apologised after he said minority communities have brought with them ' endemic ' corruption a senior cabinet minister has apologised for claiming corruption in @entity8 ’s @entity7 community is ‘ endemic ’			1
@entity9 , the attorney general , said sorry after pointing to a ‘ favour culture ’ among @entity7 – remarks which were quickly branded ‘ offensive ’			1
he told saturday ’s @entity12 that corruption was a growing problem ‘ because we have minority communities in this country which come from backgrounds where corruption is endemic ’			1
but just hours later mr @entity0 backtracked and issued an apology			1
in a statement he said : ‘ if i gave the impression that there is a particular problem in the @entity7 community , i was wrong … i believe the @entity7 community has enriched this country a great deal … i ’m sorry if i have caused any offence			1
’ his initial comments were rebuked by @entity32 mep @entity31 , who said they were ‘ ill - advised ’ and ‘ offensive , divisive ’			1
mr @entity31 accused mr @entity0 of trying to ‘ paint all @entity8 @entity7 community members in a certain light ’			1
the mp , whose @entity38 constituency in @entity39 has a sizeable @entity41 community , said : ' i can see many of them have come because of the opportunities that they get			2
but they also come from societies where they have been brought up to believe you can only get certain things through a favour culture			0
' one of the things you have to make absolutely clear is that that is not the case and it 's not acceptable			0
' mr @entity0 had previously said electoral corruption was a problem in constituencies such as @entity60 in @entity61 where @entity32 councillor @entity62 ( pictured ) was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008 asked if he was referring to the @entity7 community in his comments , mr @entity0 told the newspaper : ' yes , it 's mainly the @entity7 community , not the @entity71 community			1
i would n't draw it down to one			0
i 'd be wary of saying it 's just a @entity7 problem			1
' he used the interview to highlight the issue of electoral fraud as an area of particular concern			2
however , @entity32 mep @entity31 , the party 's legal affairs spokesman in the @entity82 , hit out at mr @entity0			1
he told the @entity83 : ' as a member of the @entity8 @entity7 community myself , i found these comments to be offensive , divisive ; i do think they were ill - advised and i 'm afraid the very general way in which @entity0 is trying to make the points that he is making will have the net effect of being seen as purely populist in nature			1
' he added that it was ' quite clear when one carries out even the most basic examination of the claims that he is making that the facts do not support the argument that he is presenting '			0
disgraced @entity62 and five others were jailed in 2009 for using ' ghost ' voters to win a @entity101 ballot ( file picture ) mr @entity31 continued : ' it 's absolutely essential that if any politician in an influential position , regardless of whatever personal political ambitions that individual may have , it is essential that they do not try and behave in a way that creates a general impression about any particular community			1
' if @entity0 has got any individual specific points he wants to make in relation to voter fraud or anything of that nature that 's quite a separate issue and can be looked at			2
' but to try and generalise in this way and to paint all @entity8 @entity7 community members in a certain light , i 'm afraid that is simply something that can not be ignored and it is certainly not something that the @entity8 public at large will accept from @entity0 at all			1
' today mr @entity31 welcomed the attorney general 's apology			1
in a message on @entity129 the @entity127 mep said : " completely accept @entity0 's apology			1
" @entity32 chairman @entity132 said it was wrong to single out a particular community			2
condemnation : @entity137 , the @entity138 minister , has previously said the @entity32 lost three seats at the general election because of voter fraud in the @entity41 community inflammatory : @entity144 sparked outrage on a previous visit to @entity71 by suggesting @entity7 was ' exporting terrorism ' he told the @entity83 : ' of course corruption needs to be rooted out wherever it is in this country			1
but we think that 's something that needs to be tackled everywhere , not in a specific community			2
' mr @entity132 said the @entity7 community has ' done an awful lot to work in this country and actually is a well - respected , established community that i think has lent a lot to @entity8 '			1
he added : ' i do n't agree that pinpointing one community over another is the right thing to do			2
actually corruption is something which , wherever it is , this government wants to root it out			0
' if it 's in voting , for example , then we have already passed a piece of legislation which means that people have to individually register for votes in the future			0
that will solve that problem			0
' wherever corruption exists we 'll make sure we root it out but we certainly do n't want to pin that on any particular communities			2
' @entity144 sparked outrage earlier in his premiership when he accused @entity7 of ‘ exporting terrorism ’ while on a visit to @entity71			2
@entity137 , the @entity138 minister , has previously said the @entity32 lost three seats at the general election because of voter fraud in the @entity41 community			2
jailed for electoral fraud : @entity62 disgraced @entity32 representative @entity62 and five others used fake votes to oust longstanding @entity194 councillor @entity193 from her seat on @entity101			0
the audacious scam in 2007 was described by the @entity197 as part of an ' epidemic ' which threatens to destroy democracy in the @entity8			0
@entity62 , 52 , received a three - and - a - half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud , conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury			0
during his trial the court heard that @entity62 , a father - of - 10 , had been dishonestly elected as a @entity32 councillor in may 2007 after a scheme in which ' ghost voters ' were registered on the electoral role			0
the fraudulent plot was uncovered when ousted @entity194 councillor and former mayor miss @entity193 and her @entity194 team questioned the result			0
they pointed out that at a number of houses up to 19 names - all @entity41 - had registered in the run up to the election at the same address then opted to vote by post			0
@entity223 , prosecuting at the trial said the action of the convicted vote - riggers was like a virus that needed to be eradicated			0
he referred to a report by @entity230 @entity229 which served as a warning that unless the @entity8 election procedures are changed , the nation 's democracy will be at stake			0
citing the report mr @entity223 said : ' the systems to deal with fraud are not working well , they are not working badly - the fact is there are no real systems			0
' until there are , fraud will continue unabated			0
the system for voting would disgrace a banana republic			0
