‘ it seemed to me that he had properly apologised and acknowledged the mistakes that the regional health authority had made when he ran it for that short period of time as these events unfolded			0

‘ it is clear he no longer enjoys the support of front - line staff			0
‘ as stories of quality horrors , bullying and service dislocation emerge , it would seem time to recognise sir @entity6 ’s huge contribution to the @entity5 in the past but make it clear he is not the man to take the @entity5 into the future			1
politicians insist on the @entity5 being run in a business - like way			2
in defence : prime minister @entity22 said the @entity5 chief executive should not be made into a scapegoat over the @entity27 scandal , and has done a ' very good job ' he continued : ‘ if this were a business i think the shareholders would be calling for a new boss and a clean sweep of the board			1
‘ i do n’t see why taxpayers should expect anything less			0
’ sir @entity6 ’s position has come under increasing pressure over the last fortnight following a damning report into the @entity27 disaster			1

@entity134 and @entity135 , two senior managers at @entity138 hospitals , said they raised concerns three years ago but were hounded from their jobs			0

ignored : whistle blowers @entity134 ( left ) and @entity135 ( right ) , two senior managers at @entity138 hospitals , say they wrote to sir @entity6 in 2009 but were hounded from their jobs sir @entity6 appears to be losing political support and at least two @entity150 mps from the health select committee , @entity152 and dr @entity153 , believe he should go			1
on tuesday , health minister dr @entity154 also appeared to invite him to ‘ consider ’ his position			2
when questioned on @entity158 ’s @entity157 , dr @entity154 said : ‘ @entity6 can obviously consider his own position			2
‘ but at the moment we are accepting the fact that he , like many people , has made an apology for what he has done and we need now to move on and make sure that we never let another @entity166 happen again			0
’ aside from his role in the scandal , many health professionals privately believe that unless sir @entity6 leaves , the culture of secrecy within the @entity5 will not change			1

miss @entity175 , who set up the @entity180 after her mother @entity181 died at @entity182 in 2007 , said : ‘ we are really disappointed			0
we thought that this leader would help us cure the @entity5			0
there has been calls for sir @entity6 to be sacked over the shamed @entity5 @entity27 trust , a hospital which he visited and reviewed with a ' well done ' at the height of the scandal ‘ it is not scapegoating anyone - this man has failed			1
he has failed not only in his role at the strategic health authority but he has also gone on to be knighted and promoted to chief executive of the @entity5 while we have 14 hospitals under investigation and a workforce that is demoralised			1
it is a sad day for @entity5			0

’ miss @entity175 said mr @entity204 should not have made the comments prior to sir @entity6 's evidence session before the committee on march 5			2
