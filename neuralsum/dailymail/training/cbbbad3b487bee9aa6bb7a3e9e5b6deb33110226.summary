where there ’s ' @entity2 ' there ’s @entity3			1
the 66 - year - old disgraced gridiron great has hired himself a fellow felon - @entity6 , aka smoke - to protect him in prison			1
@entity3 has been worried about attacks from aggressive inmates at the @entity10 in @entity11 , where he has been incarcerated since 2008			1
he fears there are prisoners who want to make a name for themselves by hurting ' the juice , ' especially on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the brutal murders of his ex-wife @entity19 and her friend @entity21			1
' he found the biggest guy who is in great shape and willing to fend off the bullies to help @entity3 out -- but , of course , it comes at a price , ' a close friend revealed			0
my bodyguard : @entity6 , @entity31 , will be watching @entity3 's back			1
' he found the biggest guy who is in great shape and willing to fend off the bullies to help @entity3 out -- but , of course , it comes at a price , ' a friend revealed smoke is only 44 - years - old , he 's 6 ' tall , weighs 180 pounds and his physical build is described as ' large ' on the @entity42 records			1
and he 's prepared to watch @entity3 's back for a few favors			2
' obviously , @entity3 ca n't give @entity2 any cash money but since he still gets bucks from his books every month through his family and from his female fans , @entity2 tells @entity3 what he wants from the commissary -- extra food , toiletries , stamps to send out letters , magazines - and @entity3 will get it for him ! ' and @entity3 has also promised if he is paroled in 2017 and @entity2 is still there he will continue to put money on his books until he is paroled and help him when he gets out , like if he needs a place to crash for a while			1
' ' @entity3 even told @entity63 he may hire him as a bodyguard when they are both free because the world is just as dangerous as prison life is for him ! but he joked he will pay him in it cash instead of cookies , an extra blanket or cup - a - soup noodles ! ' @entity73 was jailed in in 2002 for armed robbery with a deadly weapon and kidnapping			1
this was not his first time in the slammer			0
the kidnapping charges were dropped in a plea deal and he was sentenced to 10 - 25 in the medium security prison in @entity10 , @entity11 , where he later met @entity3 in 2008			1
@entity3 who was also convicted for armed robbery and kidnapping			0
flabby : @entity3 is not the football powerhouse he once was , not by a long shot			0
he has high blood pressure , diabetes and his knees are so banged up from playing football he can barely walk as reported exclusively by @entity95 last week , @entity93 , the father of @entity19 's friend who was murdered with her on that hot june night , revealed @entity3 had been attacked several times			1
@entity96 says that he had heard a couple of rumors about @entity3 , so he called the @entity100 's office in @entity11 to find out if they were true or not			2
the first was that @entity3 was beaten up in prison			2
he found out the former @entity104 star was hit hard in his chest by another inmate but it was nothing serious			0
the second rumor was that ' someone in the prison found @entity3 attractive			2
' the @entity100 told him the prison officials reported back ' we know nothing about @entity115 ! ' -- but their tone was very tongue - and - cheek			0
when @entity93 pressured the @entity100 and asked ' what does that mean ? ' the @entity100 responded ; ' it means exactly what you think it means			0
' @entity21 said the @entity100 gave him the impression that @entity3 had , indeed , been sexually attacked			1
' when @entity3 first arrived at @entity123 he was treated like royalty by the prisoners because they watched this guy play football for years so they were big fans			2
but after all the fanfare wore off and @entity3 was treated just like everybody else by the guards he became a target , ' the family friend added			0
fairytale turns horror story : @entity3 and @entity19 were divorced when stabbed to death			0
her neck was cut from ear - to - ear with her head almost severed from her body			0
she was 35 , the mother of @entity141 and @entity142 ' over the past couple of years @entity3 started having some problems because of all of the scuttlebutt between the prisoners about his appeal and possible parole so they feel his days are numbered and they wanted to get some stuff from him or make a name for themselves before he left for good			1
' some of the inmates started harassing @entity3 , forcing him to get them some things from the commissary and attacking him when the guards were not looking			2
' @entity3 is not the football powerhouse he once was , not by a long shot			0
he has high blood pressure , diabetes and his knees are so banged up from playing football he can barely walk			1
his excessive weight gain adds to all of these problems			0
' so a younger guy could take @entity3 down with very little effort and some of them want to be the one to literally bring @entity3 to his knees before he can get out of there in a few year , ' the friend continued			0
' but @entity3 has something the other inmates do n't and that 's a lot of money on his books every month so he ' hired ' @entity2 to literally play defense for him inside the prison			1
' and he picked the right guy			0
no escape : the @entity10 facility is out in the middle of the @entity11 desert and backed up against sky scraping mountains ' now we are in the summer months and it gets really hot in the @entity11 desert so @entity3 feels free to hang outside in the prison yard and coach one of the prison baseball teams while eating ice cream on the bench because @entity2 is right there making sure nobody bothers @entity3			1
' @entity3 has a sweet tooth that he has a hard time controlling so when he 's not wrapping his mouth around an ice cream sandwich , one of his favorites , he 's may be ' lifting ' a few extra cookies from the chow hall ! as previously reported last year , @entity3 filled up his shirt with oatmeal cookies but he was busted by a prison guard on the way back to his cell after lunch			2
initially the guard thought @entity3 was trying to smuggle in a cell phone or some other sort of contraband so he was flabbergasted to find ' the juice ' had packed his shirt with cookies ! the guard yelled out ; ' @entity3 ! hold it right there ! ' once the guard opened up his shirt and started throwing the cookies onto the floor the other prisoners began to hoot , howl and fall over with laughter ! @entity3 stood there there with a goofy grin on his face , totally embarrassed			2
a father 's grief : @entity93 ( right ) , father of @entity21			1
a friend of @entity19 's who just happened to drop by her confo to return her mother 's glasses , keeps tabs on @entity3 and says he was attacked twice			1
but this is what his life has become -- @entity3 's new normal -- and it will be that way for at least another three years when he will be up for parole in 2017			2
@entity10 is located about 5 miles from the tiny town of @entity10 , @entity11 , about 93 miles from @entity241			0
the correctional facility is out in the middle of the desert and backed up against sky scraping mountains on one side and facing a the @entity249 highway on the other , which is 2 miles away , so it is literally impossible to escape without being quickly detected			0
@entity123 houses mostly medium custody general population inmates , but there are some close custody protective segregation inmates as well as separate unit housing a small number of minimum custody inmates			0
the total capacity for @entity123 is approximately 1,680 inmates .			0

@entity3 , 66 , incarcerated at medium security @entity10 , is *afraid* prisoners out to make a name for themselves are *gunning* for him
he 's already been attacked twice , according to @entity21 's father @entity93 , who likes to keep tabs on @entity3
@entity3 tapped convict @entity2 " @entity6 to be his bodyguard . he 's six feet tall and weighs 180
smoke gets paid in *snacks* , toiletries and magazines from the commissary . @entity3 has a fat prison bank account is no longer in *shipshape* .
he is *overweight* and has high blood pressure and diabetes
