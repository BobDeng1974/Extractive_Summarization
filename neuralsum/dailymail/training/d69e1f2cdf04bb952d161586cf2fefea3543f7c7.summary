and as these pictures show , @entity9 @entity8 and @entity10 have dug their way to victory			0
the pair of @entity9 have constructed the 650m attraction in @entity16 , will only stay open for two days , as part of a festival to help combat depression and promote the pair 's motto : ' living more awesome '			1
but only 2,000 people will have the honour of riding the water slide			2
in a video posted online , mr @entity8 walks through a ' luge - track ' style trench cut in the hillside , which includes a ' tunnel ' where the slide runs under a fence			2
despite being a mud track through fields of cows at the moment , @entity55 ( left ) and @entity8 's ( right ) waterslide is expected to clinch the title of world 's longest when it is complete it was initially a mud track through fields of cows but is expected to clinch the title of world 's longest now it is completed co-founder @entity55 said : ' we 're a couple of @entity71 guys who like so many others have really suffered at hands of depression			1
' it was really tough , but having come out the other side we decided the best way for us to keep depression at bay was to ' @entity79 '			0
' we hope this amazing project will encourage others to do the same and we want people to know it 's okay to ask for help			0
' it 's much easier to make a difference or be awesome when you have friends by your side			2
' mr @entity8 can be seen on a @entity92 video clip about the making of the project explaining just how long it is			0
three slides are being built down the hillside - the 650metre - long monster , along with two smaller ones - one 80metres and another 60metre ' grandma slip'n'slide ' for the more timid			1
currently the world 's longest waterslide is the @entity103 in @entity105 's @entity104			1
it measures 211m in length and features lights , sounds and fog effects			0
about halfway through there is a 6m section where the slider goes almost into freefall			0
@entity8 's previous adventures include riding a lilo down the @entity117 in @entity9			0
the 650metre - long waterslide , the brainchild of @entity9 @entity8 and @entity55 ( pictured ) , will be open for public to use on february 23 and 24 near @entity16 the opening of the slide will form part of a festival to help combat depression and promote the pair 's motto ' living more awesome ' the men say ' @entity129 ' was based around the idea that if they continued to strive for better things and ' live more awesome ' then there was no way that depression would ever get them again			1
through their online and social media presence , then men hope to connect those people to others with like minds and encourage people to have hobbies , do things rather than buying things and have fun			0
