revealed : @entity1 's will was among more than a million published online today with the @entity5 sisters among her most famous creations , it comes as no surprise that @entity1 left most of her worldly assets to her own sibling , according to her will published online today			1
the novelist 's last request was for her ' dearest ' sister @entity13 to receive all of her possessions , spare the cost of her funeral , £ 50 - the equivalent of £ 1,700 in today 's money - to her brother @entity19 and another £ 50 to his cook			1
@entity1 's will was among a collection of thousands , including those of @entity24 and sir @entity25 , which were published online for the first time today			1
just like her characters @entity1 and @entity29 , @entity1 and @entity13 were extremely close , so much so that the writer left the majority of her estate , worth around £ 800 ( more than £ 27,000 today ) , to her elder sister			1
during @entity1 's lifetime the pair wrote hundreds of letters to one another , and it is from these missives that historians were able to gather much of what is known about the author			2
@entity1 also left a sum of money to her brother @entity19 , who helped her to get her books published , and to his cook @entity46			2
the will was written just months before @entity1 's death in july 1817 following a long illness , believed to be @entity51 's disease , at the age of just 41			2
she wrote : ' i @entity1 of the parish of @entity56 do by this my last @entity57 give and bequeath to my dearest sister @entity58 every thing of which i may die possessed , or which may be hereafter due to me , subject to the payment of my @entity61 , & to a @entity62 of £ 50 to my @entity63 , & £ 50 to @entity64 - which i request may be paid as soon as convenient			0
' and i appoint my said dear @entity65 of this my last @entity57			0
' the collection of wills , including @entity1 's , is the most comprehensive collection of its kind , covering 1384 to 1858 , and detailing the assets , occupation and the standard of living of the dead			2
family ties : the tight - knit @entity5 sisters , as portrayed in the 1995 @entity76 series , were among @entity1 's most celebrated creations sisterly bond : @entity1 , played by @entity80 ( left ) in @entity81 @entity1 , and @entity13 ( @entity82 ) were exceptionally close according to his will , @entity24 left £ 150 ( £ 14,400 today ) to his daughter @entity84 in 1616 , and famously decreed that his ' second best bed ' should go to his wife @entity86			1
however , historians believe that during @entity24 's life time wealthy families would reserve their best bed for guests , meaning the gift was actually far more sentimental than at first glance			0
under common law @entity86 also had a right to one third of his estate and to live their marital home for the rest of her life , which she did			0
most of the playwright 's possessions went to his daughter @entity105 and her husband @entity106			0

@entity112 of @entity113 , which is publishing the collection , said : ' these probate records provide fascinating insight into the final fortunes of some of our nation 's most famous names , right down to who should get their bed			0
' they are an incredibly valuable family history resource , covering a period in history from which few official documents remain			0
