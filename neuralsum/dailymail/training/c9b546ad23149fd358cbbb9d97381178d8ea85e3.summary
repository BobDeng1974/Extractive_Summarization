sedimentary structures have been found on @entity1 that mimic those formed by microbes on @entity4			1
it is the latest piece of evidence that suggests life was once on @entity1 , although it is not direct proof of its existence			1
the structures were revealed in images of a lakebed that is thought to have undergone seasonal flooding billions of years ago			1
shown is an overlay of a sketch on a photograph from above to assist in the identification of the structures on the rock bed surface dr @entity32 , a geobiologist at @entity16 in @entity17 , has spent the past 20 years studying these microbial structures			1
on @entity4 , carpet - like colonies of microbes trap and rearrange sediments in shallow bodies of water such as lakes and coastal areas , forming distinctive features that fossilise over time			2
in december 2014 it was announced an instrument on the @entity23 had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface			1
the new discovery , reported in the journal @entity51 , followed studies of gas samples by @entity23 's @entity54 ( @entity54 ) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis			0
it revealed a low background level of methane , which spiked 10-fold over a period of just 60 @entity1 days			2
while there are non-biological explanations , experts suggested that its finding may be a sign of life on @entity1			0
these structures , known as microbially - induced sedimentary structures , are found in shallow water settings all over the world and in ancient rocks spanning @entity4 's history			2
in a paper published in the journal @entity79 , she detailed the striking similarities between @entity1 sedimentary structures in the 3.7 billion - year - old @entity83 outcrop and microbial structures on @entity4			1
the distinctive shapes include erosional remnants , pockets , domes , roll - ups , pits , chips and cracks , which on @entity4 can extend from a few centimeters to many kilometers			0
she adds that it is not definitive proof that these structures on @entity1 were shaped by biology			0
such confirmation would require a rock sample to be returned to earth for microscopic analysis			0
' all i can say is , here 's my hypothesis and here 's all the evidence that i have , ' dr @entity32 said , ' although i do think that this evidence is a lot			0
' the findings follow the recent detection of methane on @entity1 that could have originated from organics on the planet			1
' along with the recent reports of methane and organics on @entity1 , her findings add an intriguing piece to the puzzle of a possible history for life on our neighboring planet , ' said dr @entity124 , a geomicrobiologist at the @entity125			1
on the left is a comparison of cracks in @entity129 on @entity1 and in a modern microbial mat in @entity131 , @entity132			0
on the right , knob - shaped structures on @entity1 are compared to similar structures caused by erosion of microbial mats at @entity138 , @entity139			2
on @entity4 , both are formed by microbes @entity83 is an ancient body of water that was once believed to once be at the bottom of @entity24 on @entity1 , shown here in this illustration			1
the patterns found in the @entity149 outcrop are consistent with the microbial structures found in similar environments on @entity4 dr @entity32 spent several weeks investigating images centimetre by centimetre , drawing sketches and comparing them to structures on @entity4			1
the photos showed striking morphological similarities between the terrestrial and @entity1 sedimentary structures			0
the distribution patterns of the microbial structures on @entity4 vary depending on where they are found			0
different types of structures are found together in different types of environments			0
for instance , microbial mats that grow in rivers will create a different set of associations than those that grow in seasonally flooded environments			0
the patterns found in the @entity149 outcrop are consistent with the microbial structures found in similar environments on @entity4			2
in her paper , she also describes alternative processes through which these could have formed			0
for instance , the chips , pits and cracks could be the product of erosion by salt , water , or wind			0
' but if the @entity1 structures are n't of biological origin , then the similarities in morphology , but also in distribution patterns with regards to microbially - induced sedimentary structures on @entity4 would be an extraordinary coincidence , ' she said			1
last month , scientists in @entity199 revealed evidence that suggests there is life on @entity1 based on readings taken by the @entity23 ( shown )			1
they say methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria			2
this sedimentary finding is the latest feather in the cap for the possibility of life once existing on @entity1			2

geobiologist from @entity16 in @entity17 has revealed pictures that show structures on @entity1 similar to ones on @entity4
*crucially* , the structures on @entity4 were formed by microbes
it is the latest piece of evidence that life once existed on @entity1
the images were taken by @entity23 at an ancient lakebed in @entity24
findings follow recent detection of methane spikes on @entity1 that could have originated from organics
