around 12,800 years ago @entity0 was plunged into a ‘ @entity1 ’ , resulting in the extinction of many species			1
what caused this event , however , is not known			0
one theory is that @entity0 was struck by a comet or asteroid at the time and now new research supporting the theory has been released			0
by studying nanodiamonds scattered across @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , the researchers say the impact theory is right			1
a study by the @entity19 says a cosmic impact ( illustrated ) is the best explanation for the ' @entity1 ' 12,800 years ago			1
they say evidence for this comes from nanodiamonds scattered across 11 countries that could only have come from space in the @entity19 study , scientists claim the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) period - the name given to the cooling episode about 12,800 years ago - was the result of a cosmic impact			1
this drastic climate change coincided with the extinction of @entity38 , such as the saber - tooth cats and the mastodon , and resulted in major declines in prehistoric human populations , including the end of the prehistoric @entity46 @entity45 culture			0
the result of the impact , they say , was a @entity52 ( @entity51 ) layer of nanodiamonds scattered over 19 million square miles ( 50 million square km )			2
nanodiamonds are types of diamond that result from detonations or explosions			0
the @entity30 period is also known as the @entity1			1
it was a period of cold climatic conditions and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 years ago			2
scientists believe this change in climate was caused by a meteor impact , but another theory is that it was because of the collapse of the @entity15 ice sheets			0
during the period , forests in @entity72 were replaced with a glacial tundra			0
there was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in @entity79			0
the drier conditions caused drought in the @entity82 , known as the region of @entity84 or the @entity85 , which led inhabitants to agriculture			0
the change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation			0
‘ in [ 11 ] countries of the @entity95 , the @entity51 layer contains a clearly defined abundance peak in nanodiamonds , a major cosmic - impact proxy , ’ professor @entity91 and his colleagues wrote			2
microscopic nanodiamonds , melt - glass , carbon spherules , and other high - temperature materials are found in abundance throughout the @entity51 field , in a thin layer located only metres from the @entity0 's surface			1
because these materials formed at temperatures in excess of 2,200 ° @entity110 ) , the fact they are present together so near to the surface suggests they were likely created by a major extraterrestrial impact event , such as an asteroid			1
in addition to providing support for the cosmic impact hypothesis , the study also offers evidence to reject alternate hypotheses for the formation of the @entity51 nanodiamonds , such as wildfires and increased volcanic activity			1
with limited evidence , several rival theories have been proposed about the event that sparked this period , such as a collapse of the @entity15 ice sheets , a major volcanic eruption , or a solar flare			1
according to the study the result of the impact was a @entity52 ( @entity51 ) layer scattered over 19 million square miles ( 50 million square kilometres )			0
through the regions shown in this map material is found in a thin layer just a few metres below the surface across the globe based on multiple analytical procedures , the researchers determined that the majority of the materials in the @entity51 samples are nanodiamonds and not some other kinds of minerals			1
the analysis showed that the nanodiamonds consistently occur in the @entity51 layer over broad areas			0
to date , scientists know of only two layers on @entity0 in which nanodiamonds have been found in various locations , indicating an impact event			2
these are the @entity51 layer in this study and the well - known @entity163 boundary 65 million years ago , which is marked by the mass extinction of the dinosaurs			2
' the evidence we present settles the debate about the existence of abundant @entity51 nanodiamonds , ' @entity91 said			0
the study , ‘ nanodiamond - rich layer across three continents consistent with major cosmic impact , ’ was published in the @entity171			2
material from the @entity51 layer , carbon spherules shown here , formed at temperatures in excess of 2,200 ° @entity110 )			0
this suggests they were likely created by a major impact event			1
several other theories have been suggested for this @entity30 period nearly 13,000 years ago , including wildfires and a solar flare			1

a study by the @entity19 says a cosmic impact is the best explanation for the ' @entity1 ' 12,800 years ago
they say evidence for this comes from nanodiamonds scattered across 11 countries that could only have come from space
the material is found in a thin layer just a few metres below the surface
and they also formed at temperatures in excess of @entity204 ( *4,000* ° f )
this suggests they were likely created by a major impact event
several other theories have been suggested for this @entity30 period nearly 13,000 years ago , including wildfires and a solar flare
but this latest evidence suggests a cosmic impact is the best theory
