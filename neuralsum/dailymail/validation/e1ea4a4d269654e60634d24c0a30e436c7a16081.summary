it was a privilege to watch @entity1 on wednesday when he produced a performance that will live long in the memory			1
there have been times over the last 12 months , particularly at the @entity6 , when i wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against @entity13 was magnificent proof that he is still the best around			0
what he did to @entity13 — and the way he has played since @entity18 — makes me think he has jumped back above @entity19 in their struggle to be football ’s no 1			2
it will make their battle in this weekend ’s @entity27 even more intriguing			0
@entity1 was in inspired form against @entity13 and proved he is still the best around @entity19 has struggled of late and @entity1 may have jumped back above the @entity30 star i am hoping that the @entity31 will produce the dream final of @entity33 versus @entity34 — i will be in @entity35 on june 6 — and it would be fascinating to see @entity1 in this form in a showdown against his mentor			1
we all saw @entity42 ’s reaction to @entity1 ’s trickery during the game and , afterwards in @entity33 , i was among a group from @entity46 that went for some dinner when we were fortunate to bump into @entity34 ’s manager			1
he gave us a couple of moments of his time and , inevitably , @entity42 was asked whether he fancied coming up against @entity1 when the quarter - final draw was made			0
@entity34 , after all , have been in outstanding form , scoring goals for fun , but his reaction was telling			0
‘ no ! no ! no ! ’ said @entity42			0
‘ if i have to face @entity1 , i want it to be in one game rather than two ! ’ if they do happen to face each other in @entity35 — and after friday 's draw it is not wrong to expect @entity33 and @entity34 to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat			2
@entity65 slides as @entity1 nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their @entity31 match @entity1 slips the ball through @entity13 midfielder @entity65 's legs at the @entity70 @entity65 approaches @entity33 star @entity1 during their @entity31 tie on wednesday @entity34 manager @entity42 ( centre ) reacts to the ridiculous skill from @entity1 during the match			1
