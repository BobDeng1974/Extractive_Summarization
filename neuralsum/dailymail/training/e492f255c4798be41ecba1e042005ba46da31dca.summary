@entity8 bought the ready meal from her local supermarket as a quick dinner for her child @entity12			1
but as the 22 - year - old cut the meal up on her daughter 's high chair plate she was stunned when her knife hit a sharp slither of razor - sharp metal			2
shock discovery : @entity8 , 22 , with her partner @entity21 , 22 , and daughter @entity22 , who was almost fed a chicken kiev containing a saw blade chilling : this is the inch - long shard found embedded in the meal , which looks similar to a hacksaw blade when she examined the food she was shocked when she discovered a jagged shard of metal			1
the mother - of - one was enraged when she returned to the branch in @entity35 , @entity36 , to find they could offer no explanation for how the blade got into the dish			0
she was offered another pack of Â£ 2.50 kievs as an apology for the incident which happened on october 5			2
the data manager at a cancer research firm is calling for an urgent investigation into the source of the blade - to make sure no one else suffers the same fate			2
miss @entity8 , of @entity50 , @entity36 said : ' i was in a rush that evening because it was my sister @entity53 's 18th birthday in @entity55 and so we had n't got any time to go shopping			2
offending ready meal : miss @entity8 had bought the twin - pack of fresh kievs from a nearby @entity2 's local as a quick dinner for her one - year - old daughter , but felt the metal when she cut into it ' i popped in to the store and grabbed a two pack of kievs , the fresh ones not frozen , so my daughter could have dinner			1
apology : @entity2 's say they have launched an investigation and the store the family bought it from gave her two more free ' when we got home i cooked them both and when they were done i cut one up on @entity12 's plate and heard a clink when my knife hit something			1
' i picked it up to check what had made the noise and the razor blade fell from the bottom			0
' i was disgusted , if i had n't heard the clunk i would have just served it up - i dread to think what could have happened			1
' i took it back to the shop and the deputy manager was very apologetic , they gave me some new ones , which i checked in the shop and said the manager would contact me			0
' when he did all he could say was that they could only offer their sincere apologies and were looking into the matter			0
' i wanted to know how it got in there but they could n't tell me			0
' this needs to be looked into as soon as possible			0
if it is because of something from the manufacture or the machines then there needs to be a recall			0
' i dread to think what could have happened			2
' i will never be shopping at @entity2 's again , it puts you off , if they could have offered an explanation or made it clear it would never happen again i might , but not now			1
' the supermarket giant is now investigating the claims			0
