by @entity0 the key to good taste lies in your genes rather than your tongue			0
it has long been known that some people are more sensitive to the bitter taste of broccoli and @entity11 sprouts			1
and many believed this was because these ‘ super-tasters ’ have so many taste buds that their tongue is extra bumpy			1
a study has disproved the long - held belief that people with ' bumpy ' tongues are hyper - sensitive to taste the theory has also been used to explain why some people do n’t like spicy food or why some children are picky eaters			1
now , a study has shown that having a bumpy tongue does n’t affect the ability to taste – at least where bitterness is concerned			2
however , a person ’s genes are important , the journal frontiers in @entity34 reports			0
researcher @entity35 , of the @entity36 in @entity37 , made the connection after asking hundreds of museum visitors to stick out their tongues			2
the bitter taste of broccoli can be detected by anyone regardless of how bumpy their tongue is after rating their bumpiness , she checked the volunteers ’ sensitivity to bitter chemicals and analysed their dna for genes involved in detecting sharp tastes			0
she said : ‘ there is a long - held belief that if you stick out your tongue and look at the bumps on it , then you can predict how sensitive you are to strong tastes like bitterness in vegetables and strong sensations like spiciness			0
‘ the commonly accepted theory has been that the more bumps you have , the more taste buds you have and therefore the more sensitive you are			1
‘ no matter how we looked at the data , we could n’t replicate this long - held assumption			0

study *claims* to disprove theory that bumpy tongues are hyper - sensitive
many believed this was a *physical* sign a person had more taste buds
@entity37 researchers found it does not make foods taste more bitter or spicy
