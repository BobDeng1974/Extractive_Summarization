by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 have completed the re-construction of their new threequarter line with the signing of @entity7 winger @entity6 on a three - year contract from @entity9			1
@entity6 has been recognised as one of the most promising talents in @entity12 since bursting onto the scene two years ago but a move to big - spending @entity15 fell through at the end of last season when he sustained a major knee injury playing for the @entity7 against @entity19			1
@entity6 , who made his @entity12 comeback in the @entity9 ' shock 40 - 36 win over @entity23 on sunday , when he took his try tally to 38 in 52 appearances , is the @entity26 ' fifth new recruit for 2015 and will join @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 in a new - look back line			1
moving on : @entity6 ( right ) has left the @entity9 to join @entity2 on a three - year contract ' i wanted a new challenge and when i had the opportunity to come here i was very honoured , ' said @entity6 , who turns 22 on friday			1
' i 'll be moving my family from one side of the country to the other so it is going to be a big change for us but one we are excited about			0
' there 's a big history at the club and the derby was something that appealed to me too			0
i 've been in @entity46 my whole life and there is n't anything like the rivalry in @entity2 down there			1
' i spoke to some boys that have played here and they say the city splits in two on derby day			0
i ca n't wait to be a part of it and show everyone what i can do for the red and white half of the city			0
' i made the @entity7 squad at the end of last year but my injury halted my progress a little bit			2
' it 's been frustrating but after two good years i 'm hoping i can get back to my best form and challenge for an @entity7 spot in the not too distant future			0
' @entity2 coach @entity71 said : ' we 're delighted that @entity6 has chosen to come to @entity2 from next season			1
' he was on the verge of a full @entity7 call - up 12 months ago and he 's had plenty of interest from other clubs so it 's great that we 've been able to sign a player of his calibre			0
' we 've identified a lack of speed in the outside backs and @entity6 certainly brings pace in abundance			2
he 's a great finisher and he scored another good try at the weekend so we 're looking forward to what he can bring to the side			0
' honoured : @entity6 admits he was looking for a new challenge after two years playing for @entity9 @entity6 is the fourth confirmed @entity46 player to retain his @entity12 status following the @entity9 ' relegation to the @entity94			1
@entity95 is joining @entity96 and @entity97 and @entity98 have secured moves to @entity100			0
@entity9 coach @entity101 said : ' i want to make it quite clear to all our supporters that we did make a substantial offer to him over a seven to eight - week period of negotiations but in @entity6 's mind he always wanted to play @entity12			1
' both myself and the club wish @entity6 all the very best			2
@entity71 has done an amazing job with his recruitment strategy and @entity6 will be a fine addition to that strategy moving forward			2

@entity6 is one of the most promising talents in @entity12
he saw a move to @entity15 break down at the end of last season
the *21* - year - old says he feels ' honoured ' to join @entity2
