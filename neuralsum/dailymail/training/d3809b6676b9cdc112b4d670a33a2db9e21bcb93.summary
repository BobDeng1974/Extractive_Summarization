by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 20:01 est , 19 march 2014 @entity3 staff have been caught writing favourable reviews of their hospitals on patient feedback websites			1
they were awarding hospitals five - star ratings and posting messages such as ‘ the doctor was very helpful ’ , ‘ lovely staff ’ and ‘ very impressed with the consultant ’			2
an investigation found half the reviews of one @entity3 trust – @entity15 – on a popular feedback site were written by its own employees			1
@entity3 staff have been caught writing favourable reviews of their hospitals on feedback websites ( stock picture ) campaigners accused staff of being dishonest and said their actions undermined patients ’ ‘ fundamental trust ’			1
there are a number of @entity28 - style websites where patients can review hospitals and other services and give them a score out of five stars			1
but an investigation by the @entity38 ’s @entity37 programme found half of 100 reviews of @entity41 on website @entity42 had been written by staff			1
the trust , which mainly runs mental health services , claimed that staff were writing on behalf of vulnerable patients – such as the elderly or those with learning difficulties – who would otherwise have been unable to comment on care			1
but the investigation identified many highly suspicious reviews on other websites , which looked as though they had been written by staff pretending to be patients			1
they included comments such as : ‘ very impressed with the consultant ’ , ‘ the investigations were very thorough and performed very efficiently ’ , ‘ the doctor was very helpful ’ and ‘ lovely staff ’			0
on the @entity64 website , launched by the @entity3 last summer , reviews apparently by staff rated hospitals a whole star higher on average than those by patients			1
@entity3 whistleblower @entity71 , who was forced out of his job at @entity73 , said : ‘ we ’ve known for a long time that the culture of the @entity3 is one of staff under pressure to deliver results			0
i think this is a symptom of that , that staff are now putting on results that are n’t necessarily true and it ’s interfering with results			0
‘ the data they are reporting is skewing the results			0
it ’s making the data the public sees almost meaningless			0
’ half the reviews of @entity41 ( @entity92 in @entity94 pictured ) on one site were written by its own employees @entity96 , chief executive of the @entity42 website , said : ‘ patients and families think the @entity3 is going to tell them the truth in all sorts of ways			1
but if there ’s an incentive to do little things , like i ’ll just put in this story that looks good , that actually attacks that fundamental trust			2
’ @entity108 , director of patient experience at @entity109 , said : ‘ we ca n’t guarantee that all the reviews are coming from patients and families but we can be sure that the vast majority are			2
‘ what they were doing in @entity116 was to help vulnerable people have a voice			0
the @entity3 in @entity109 is leading the world in patient feedback			0
we have to get this in proportion			0
at that kind of scale you can not game [ cheat ] it			0
’ in august , the @entity3 launched @entity64 in a bid to make the system more transparent			0
it covers 20 hospitals in @entity131 , but by 2015 it will be rolled out to every trust and @entity133 in the @entity134 its first few weeks , it was bombarded with negative reviews about ‘ appalling ’ care , dismissive nurses and blood - spattered @entity139 units .			2
