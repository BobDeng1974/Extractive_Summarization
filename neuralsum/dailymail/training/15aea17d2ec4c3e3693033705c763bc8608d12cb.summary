@entity0 has warned @entity1 to expect a @entity3 onslaught at @entity4 on saturday			1
the @entity6 attacker is certain to start the @entity8 qualifier as @entity10 ’s side seek their first points in @entity12 after last month ’s narrow defeat by world champions @entity15			1
and @entity0 is expected to play off @entity16 ’s on - form @entity18 as the @entity19 seek to kick - start their qualifying campaign ahead of the trip to @entity22 next week			1
@entity0 has targeted for @entity3 to go on the attack against @entity1 in their @entity8 qualifier the forward featured in @entity3 's opening game defeat at world champions @entity15 in @entity29 @entity1 ( @entity30 ) - 11/10/14 @entity22 ( a ) - 14/10/14 @entity31 ( @entity30 ) - 14/11/14 @entity32 ( @entity30 ) - 29/3/15 @entity31 ( a ) - 13/6/15 @entity1 ( a ) - 4/9/15 @entity15 ( @entity30 ) - 7/9/15 @entity22 ( @entity30 ) - 8/10/15 @entity32 ( a ) - 11/10/15 ‘ i think we will be more positive , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we will be more attacking than we were in @entity15			1
we will need to be			2
‘ we are probably more favourites to win the game and there are players on form			1
‘ @entity39 ( @entity18 ) has done very well in getting goals			2
he ’s a quality player			2
it ’s probably the first time he ’s had a run without injuries			2
we should be going on to create a lot of chances and be more attacking so it will be different , whether or not i ’m playing , fletch is playing or we ’re both playing			1
‘ we ’ve also got other guys			2
@entity51 , who never played against @entity15 , will be looking to play			1
even @entity52 ( @entity53 ) has played further forward			0
with @entity54 and @entity55 in the middle , that might bring him into contention for that			0
people are still debating whether he is good enough or not , but what he has shown this week has been brilliant			0
he ’s someone i have been really impressed with			0
it might come too quickly for him to get in this one , but he will be competing for places soon enough			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , said he is relishing his first game at @entity4 since his acrimonious departure from @entity69			1
@entity0 will head back to @entity4 for the first time since joining @entity6 from @entity69 in 2012 the 28 - year - old was one of a raft of players who refused to transfer his contract to @entity77 ’s newco in 2012 , quitting for @entity6 soon after			1
reluctant to return to the stadium since , @entity0 said : ‘ it should be good			1
it ’s the first time i ’ve been back since i left @entity69			0
i have some fantastic memories from there , not only of playing with @entity69 , but when i was with @entity83 as well			0
hopefully , it can be another good memory			0
‘ this game and next month ’s against @entity86 are circumstances that do n’t come around much			2
‘ although @entity88 ’s fantastic , you play the majority of your home games there so it ’s nice to get a wee change			0
going back to @entity4 will be good			1
‘ when i left to go to @entity69 from @entity83 , it was a while before i went back to @entity96			0
it ’s not that big a deal			0
i ’ve never really thought : “ it ’s been a while			0

@entity3 target first win in their @entity8 qualifying *group*
@entity10 's side lost in @entity15 last month in @entity12 opener
@entity0 expects more attacking set - up against @entity1 at @entity4
