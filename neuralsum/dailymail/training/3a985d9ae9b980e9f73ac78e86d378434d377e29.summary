wildlife experts tracked the adult urban fox , called @entity8 , using a gps unit fitted to a collar around his neck , and were updated on his location every 30 minutes			1
during the course of three weeks , @entity8 travelled from @entity16 , across @entity17 , into @entity18 and ended in @entity19 , before the signal was lost - meaning the creature could still be on his journey			1
an adult fox , called @entity8 , pictured , was fitted with a gps tracker			1
he made the 195 - mile journey over the course of three weeks in december			1
researchers claim @entity8 was hunting for a new home after his son , @entity31 , forced him out			1
the gps signal has been lost meaning the fox could still be going a team from @entity36 ’s @entity35 fitted @entity8 and @entity31 with night - vision cameras to catch them interacting			1
@entity38 revealed @entity31 ’s body language , with his low posture and ears , indicated he was now the alpha male			0
the scientists also noticed @entity8 was not at his best and concluded he was suffering from lung worm			0
as @entity8 was was no longer the leader in his territory , experts believe he set off in search of a new home			2
dr @entity49 said : ' we do n’t exactly know what happened but we think @entity31 pushed him out and that pressure caused him to leave and try to find somewhere else			0
' scientist dr @entity53 led the research project after she discovered a father and son pair living at the end of a garden in @entity58 , @entity17			1
@entity8 , who is believed to be three years old , was the dominant member until his son , dubbed @entity31 , grew up and took control of the territory			2
@entity8 left his home on 9 december before moving to a cemetery in @entity16			1
he then headed north out of the city and across the @entity65 towards @entity66 , @entity17			1
@entity8 began to make his way back south , but appeared to change his mind and headed east			0
by @entity69 , @entity8 was tracked in @entity70 and then crossed the county ’s border into @entity18			1
he journeyed back into @entity17 over the the @entity74 and finished up in @entity19 having covered a distance of 195 miles ( 315km ) in just over three weeks - the previous record was just 32 miles set in @entity77			1
fearing @entity8 had been shot or hit by a car , dr @entity49 and her team ventured to his last known location			0
' we went to area where we last had a signal for him to see if he had been run over or injured , ' said dr @entity49			2

he headed north out of the city and across the @entity65 towards @entity66			0
@entity8 began to make his way back south but by @entity69 , @entity8 was tracked in @entity70 and into @entity18			1
he ended in @entity19 , pictured a tiny bat recently became the first on record to fly from @entity92 to mainland @entity93 - despite being just the size of a thumb			1
researchers from @entity97 attached a miniature identity ring to the bat in october 2012 as part of research into bat migration habits			0
the @entity104 ' pipistrelle bat was last seen near @entity105 in 2012 before being discovered 370 miles away in the @entity106 last month			0
it is the first known @entity3 bat to have crossed the @entity108 and the finding gives weight to claims that the bats may migrate in a similar way to birds			0
' we did n’t find anything so we assume he is still going			0
we had been tracking him since the autumn and the gps systems can fail			2
' last time we had him he appeared to be heading back along the coast towards @entity122 so i do n’t think he was finished			0
' dr @entity49 said the results confirm foxes will move out to colonise other areas when populations in urban areas reach their maximum densities			0
' we know they travel to find new territory but we did n’t expect to see him go quite so far , ' added dr @entity49			0
' especially as @entity8 is an urban fox			2
he was born in @entity16 and @entity58 and raised his young there			1
the gps tracker updated us on his location every 30 minutes			1
we kept thinking he was going to settle down but he kept going			0
' the data from the study is really important to help us understand the behaviour of urban foxes and especially how they differ from the rural fox			2
' early results last autumn showed the pair venturing a couple of roads in each direction for food , not uncommon behaviour for urban foxes			0
initially , dominant @entity8 ate first , but over the weeks the foxes ’ behaviour shifted			2

@entity38 revealed that @entity8 's son @entity31 's body language indicated he was now the boss			2

' in @entity16 and @entity58 we estimate there are 20 foxes per square kilometre , so there can be a lot of competition			2

the adult fox was fitted with a gps tracker to *monitor* its movements
he made the 195 - mile journey over the course of three weeks in december
he journeyed from @entity16 , across @entity17 , into @entity18 and ended in @entity19
it is thought he was hunting for a new home after his son forced him out
the gps signal has been lost meaning the fox could still be going
