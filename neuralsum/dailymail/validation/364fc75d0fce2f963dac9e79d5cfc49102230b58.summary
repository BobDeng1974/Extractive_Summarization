whether it was a @entity3 temple , an astronomical calendar or a centre for healing , the mystery of @entity1 has sparked endless debate over the centuries			1
now a dramatic new theory suggests that the prehistoric stone circle monument was in fact ' an ancient @entity12 on stilts '			2
the megaliths would not have been used for ceremonies at ground level , but would instead have supported a wooden platform on which ceremonies were performed to the rotating heavens , according to new research			2
he says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform during ceremonies			1
as shown in this illustration , steps or a ramp would have led to the top of the platform , where figures of importance would have stood , perhaps addressing a crowd below @entity21 , former director of some of the @entity37 's leading museums , argues that the stones were foundations for a vast platform , long since lost - ' a great altar ' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers			1
' it 's a totally different theory which has never been put forward before , ' he said			2
' all the interpretations to date could be mistaken			2
we 've been looking at @entity1 the wrong way , from the earth , which is very much a 20th - century viewpoint			1
we have n't been thinking about what they were thinking about			0
' part of his evidence lies in ancient civilisations worldwide			0
as far afield as @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , such sacred monuments were built high up , whether on manmade or natural sites , and with circular patterns possibly linked to celestial movements			0
' in early times , no spiritual ceremonies would have been performed on the ground , ' said mr @entity21			1
no - one is exactly sure why - and how - @entity1 was built more than 4,000 years ago			1
experts have suggested it was a temple , parliament and a graveyard			0
some people think the stones have healing powers , while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone			1
they could have acted as a giant musical instrument to call ancient people to the monument			2
what is clear , is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. people were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit @entity1 - for whatever reason			1
experts think that the route was a busy one and that @entity1 could be viewed differently from different positions			1
it seems that instead of being a complete barrier , the @entity95 acted as a gateway to guide visitors to the stone circle			0
' @entity100 of @entity101 and the @entity102 were always carried - as the @entity103 used to be … the feet of holy people were not allowed to touch the ground			2
we 've been looking at @entity1 from a modern , earth - bound perspective			1
' all the great raised altars of the past suggest that the people who built @entity1 would never have performed celestial ceremonies on the lowly earth … that would have been unimaginably insulting to the immortal beings , for it would have brought them down from heaven to bite the dust and tread in the dung			1
' however , he says the wood that would have been used for the platform has long since rotted away , leaving only the stone pillars that support it behind			1
mr @entity21 's museum directorships include @entity127 , which boasts world - class archaeological collections within a complex of institutions that exceed the @entity131 in size			1
today , he published his theories in a new book , titled realisation : from seeing to @entity136 , published by @entity137			0
it explores our ancestors ' understanding of the world , offering new explanations of iconic works of art and monuments			0
shown is an illustration of a @entity3 ceremony at @entity1 more than 4,000 years ago			1
this depiction does not take the new wooden platform theory into account @entity1 , built in stages between 3000 and 2000 bc , is @entity155 's most famous prehistoric monument , a @entity156 on @entity157 in @entity158 that draws more than one million annual visitors			1
it began as a timber circle , later made permanent with massive blocks of stone , many somehow dragged from dolerite rock in the @entity166 mountains			0
@entity167 has a bluish tinge and is dappled with white spots that look like stars , according to mr @entity21			1
' these megaliths , weighing between two and four tons each , were transported 250 miles [ 400km ] , an extraordinary achievement in those times , which indicates that building @entity1 was a massive communal enterprise , ' he said			1
sacred circle : @entity21 , former director of some of the @entity37 's leading museums , argues that the stones ( aerial view shown ) were foundations for a vast platform , long since lost - ' a great altar ' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers mystery : previously it had been thought the arrangement of the stones was solely to align with the sun ( shown ) , but mr @entity21 's new theory suggests they had another purpose as well he believes that ancient worshippers would have reached the giant altar by climbing curved wooden ramps or staircases , moving in the direction of the slowly circulating stars for ceremonies dedicated to , for example , a dead king 's soul or midsummer and solstice celebrations			1
his theories have been shaped by visits to ancient sites like the stone circles of @entity208 in southern @entity59 , reminiscent of @entity1 but predating it by around 6,000 years			2
only a fraction of the site has been excavated , and the purpose of its t - shaped pillars is a mystery , @entity21 said : ' these must have supported some sort of raised platform			1
' he also points to the @entity219 in @entity58 , vast drawings apparently etched into @entity221 's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived : ' they went up to the sacred place			0
these lines were a processional way , which followed the movement and shape of the stars			0
' the great mystery of early man was that we all thought the world was flat			0
everyone did until very recent times			0
all the major religious ceremonies , as the @entity237 still does in @entity12 , always ends in a circular motion , going round and round , which imitates the stars			0
' holy : ' all the major religious ceremonies , as the @entity237 still does in @entity12 , always ends in a circular motion , going round and round , which imitates the stars , ' said mr @entity21			2
shown is @entity12 in @entity247 during @entity248 , on the 27th of @entity250 , one of the holiest nights of the @entity254 calendar professor @entity255 , principal investigator on the @entity256 at @entity257 , responded with ' a fair degree of scepticism			0
' he said : ' at @entity1 , there are other structures which are clearly designed to be viewed from the ground , along astronomic alignments , and you can see the sky from pretty much anywhere			2
' sir @entity267 , a prehistorian and @entity269 , @entity270 , said : ' he could be right , but i know of no evidence to support it … there are a large number of stone circles around the country which clearly did n't have a platform on top			1
so why should stonehenge ? ' but @entity279 , an authority on prehistoric stone circles , said : ' there could be something in it			0
there is a possibility , of course			0
anything new and worthwhile about @entity1 is well worth looking into , but with care and consideration			2
' mr @entity21 also points to the @entity219 in @entity58 ( ' hands ' design shown ) , vast drawings apparently etched into @entity221 's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived , as being similar in purpose to @entity1 mr @entity21 is fully expecting resistance from fellow academics			1
he draws parallels with the 1868 discovery of magnificent prehistoric ceiling paintings in the @entity304 in @entity305 , by a geologist and archaeologist			0
' he went in there and looked on the ground - because he assumed all the evidence for early man would be on the ground , ' he said			0
' it never occurred to him to look up			0
it was his young daughter who said , papa look on the ceiling			0
' experts at the time denounced those paintings as forgeries			0
it was not until the end of the 19th century that they were accepted as genuine .			0

historian @entity21 has provided a new theory on @entity1
he says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform
this would have had people of importance upon it , with others below
a ramp or stairs would have led to the top of the platform
but the wood has long since rotted away , leaving only the stones behind
