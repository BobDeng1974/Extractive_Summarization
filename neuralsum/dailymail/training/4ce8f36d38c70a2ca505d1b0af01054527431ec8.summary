the job description for an internship at @entity5 makes it sound like an even more extreme version of @entity10 an internship at a book publishing company sounds like a dream job for many young graduates , but the job description posted by @entity5 on wednesday might be enough to make even the most desperate of aspiring literary - nerds think twice about what they might be getting into			1
demanding internships and entry - level jobs in competitive industries have been dramatized for storylines in tv shows such as @entity47 series girls and the movie @entity10			2
however those stories about demanding bosses and poorly paid roles do n't hold a candle to the demands being made by @entity5			2
the job description starts by asking for interests you might typically expect from a perspective candidate including ‘ strong interest in publishing ’ and ‘ highly motivated and ambitious			1

if that is n't enough , the lucky interns must ' know how to act and behave in a professional office environment with high standards of performance ' and ' have a commitment to excellence that can be demonstrated on a day - to - day basis			0
' to reinforce how demanding this role will be , the next sentence in description is printed in capital letters and warns ' @entity89 does not describe you			0
' in @entity47 series girls , @entity91 ( played by @entity92 ) gets fired from her internship at an independent publisher after asking to be paid @entity5 publishes avant - garde and experimental books if perspective candidates are n't scared off already , the description then goes on to state the long list of offenses that unlucky interns could be fired for : ' coming in late or leaving early without prior permission ; being unavailable at night or on the weekends ; failing to meet any goals ; giving unsolicited advice about how to run things ; taking personal phone calls during work hours ; gossiping ; misusing company property , including surfing the internet while at work ; submission of poorly written materials ; creating an atmosphere of complaint or argument ; failing to respond to emails in a timely way ; not showing an interest in other aspects of publishing beyond editorial ; making repeated mistakes ; violating company policies			1
' potential applicants are once again warned : ' do not apply if you have a work history containing any of the above			0
' for applicants confident that they fit the criteria and still willing to work for @entity132 , the job description warns candidates not too expect too much in the way of feedback from the publisher : ' we will not be able to acknowledge receipt of applications or provide feedback about your application			2
