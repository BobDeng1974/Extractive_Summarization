shooter @entity0 carried out the 2012 massacre at @entity3 @entity0 had always been a child in need of help			1
at age 3 , he was referred to special education after he began to exhibit oddly repetitive behaviors and could n't socialize like most kids			1
by fourth grade , he had been diagnosed with anxiety , obsessive compulsive disorder and autism			0
yet year after year — as psychiatrists insisted that @entity0 should be on treatment and strict medication — his mother @entity14 refused to follow through on the requests			1
she chalked up her son 's behavior to a presumed superior intelligence , seeing him as a gifted student , despite testing done by experts showing he presented average intelligence			0
but , as the years went on , the truth became clearer : @entity0 was a deeply troubled young man who obsessed over mass killings as he fell deeper into a pit of mental illness while his mother ignored his struggles these are the findings of a new report by the @entity34 in @entity35 , which released on friday a 114 - page dossier about the life of the shooter who massacred 20 children and six adult staff at @entity3 in @entity42 on december 14 , 2012			1
panicked children leave the school in the aftermath of the shooting			2
in total , 20 kids and six adult staffers were killed cops maintain a perimeter outside the school in the hours following the shooting on dec. 14 , 2012 the report charges that the local school system enabled @entity3 as she accommodated and appeased her son — even as he became more withdrawn socially and exhibited frightening signs of his obsession with murder			1
the @entity34 says there were missed opportunities to provide more treatment for @entity0			1
' both @entity66 's mother and his educational team shared a goal of managing and accommodating , rather than securing treatment for , @entity66 's disabilities , and likely this approach was fueled by a lack of critical information and guidance , ' the report says			2
the report adds : ' there were early indications of @entity66 ’s preoccupation with violence , depicted by extremely graphic writings that appeared to have been largely unaddressed by schools and possibly by parents			0
' by eighth grade , @entity0 's anxiety became so severe , he was placed in a program for children who are ' too disabled , even with supports and accommodations , to attend school			1
' a major red flag came when @entity0 was 14 : the @entity92 , where he underwent a psychological evaluation , said that a ' strategy of accommodating @entity66 , rather than addressing his underlying needs , would lead to a deteriorating life of dysfunction and isolation			2
' the @entity92 center prescribed extensive treatment and ongoing expert consultation for @entity0 — all recommendations that were ignored			1
@entity0 himself refused to follow treatment for his anxiety and @entity106 , disagreeing with doctors over his @entity109 's diagnosis and avoiding individual therapy			2
his mother @entity14 enabled him and kept him out of treatment , the report says			1
' though @entity66 was profoundly impaired by anxiety and @entity106 , his parents may not have understood the depth or implications of his disabilities , including his need for ongoing support , ' the report says			2
@entity0 completely stopped seeking psychiatric help after 2006			0
victims : @entity0 shot his mother @entity14 ( bottom right ) before heading to @entity3 , where he massacred 20 children and six adults twisted mind : @entity0 spent most of his time in an online community dedicated to talking about mass murders , as seen in this email he sent days before opening fire at @entity3 in the three months before the december 2012 massacre , @entity0 had not left his room in his mother 's spacious colonial - style house , where he lived surrounded by an arsenal of weapons and spent long hours playing violent video games			1
his parents were divorced , and @entity0 had not seen his father for two years			0
the report said @entity0 's severe and deteriorating mental health problems , combined with a preoccupation with violence and access to deadly weapons , proved a recipe for mass murder			2
@entity0 lived in ' virtual social isolation , ' spending his days obsessing over mass killings and exchanging emails with a cyber community of murder enthusiasts			0
although he struggled with depression and at times had suicidal thoughts , there is no evidence showing that he was psychotic throughout the period			0
despite his declining mental state , @entity0 's mother — with whom he 'd went on a series of shooting activities over years — did n't seem to curtail his access to the high - capacity magazine weapons guns @entity3 had in her home			1
in his last few months , @entity0 spent most of his time inside his home , refusing to leave			0
@entity0 barely ate anything and was anorexic when he died at just 112 pounds on his 6 - foot frame			0
the report also provocatively asks whether a family that was not white or as affluent as the @entity177 would have been given the same leeway to manage treatment for their troubled child			0
' is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision - making of white , affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority ? ' the report said			0
@entity0 killed his mother , @entity3 , then shot his way into the @entity42 school on dec. 14 , 2012 , and gunned down 20 children and six educators before committing suicide			1
the advocate 's office investigates all child deaths in the state for lessons on prevention			0
the authors of the @entity42 report said it aims to reinforce the importance of effective mental health treatment and communication among professionals charged with the care for children			1
' records indicate that the school system cared about @entity66 's success but also unwittingly enabled mrs. @entity216 's preference to accommodate and appease @entity66 through the educational plan 's lack of attention to social - emotional support , failure to provide related services , and agreement to @entity66 's plan of independent study and early graduation at age 17 , ' the authors wrote			1
the authors said they could not say whether more effective treatment could have prevented the tragedy			0
' this report raises , but can not definitively answer , the question as to whether better access to effective mental health and educational services would have prevented the tragic events at @entity3 , ' they wrote			2
family photos show @entity0 growing up surrounded by guns at his parents ' house ( left )			0
experts say his easy access to heavy weaponry contributed to his carrying out of the mass shooting in 2012 a shattered window at @entity3 following the shooting the police investigation into the massacre concluded more than a year ago with prosecutors saying that a motive might never be known			1
it said @entity0 was afflicted with mental health problems , but despite his dark interests , he did not display aggressive or threatening tendencies			0
documents released by police in december 2013 included descriptions of sporadic treatment for his mental health troubles			0
at one point , experts at the @entity263 prescribed antidepressant / anti-anxiety medication , but @entity3 discontinued the treatment and never scheduled follow - up visits , police reports said			2
a @entity35 judge last year ordered @entity42 school officials to give @entity0 's records the office of child advocate for its investigation			1
the governor 's @entity273 has been waiting for the office 's report before releasing its recommendations on what the state can do to prevent and respond to future mass killings			0
