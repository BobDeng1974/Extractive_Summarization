by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:09 est , 4 december 2013 cancer survival rates in @entity8 still lag well behind many other @entity10 countries , a study @entity4 rates for nine out of ten common cancers are lower than the @entity10 average , despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment			1
and the discrepancy is even worse among elderly sufferers			0
patients with nearly all forms of the disease are more likely to die in @entity8 compared with patients in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
our survival rates for cancers such as breast , prostate , bowel and lung are on a par with former states of the @entity34 including @entity35 , the @entity36 and @entity37			0
the figures suggest that age discrimination for cancer treatment is worse in @entity8 compared to elsewhere in @entity10			1
@entity8 survival rates for cancers such as breast , prostate , bowel and lung are on a par with former states of the @entity34 including @entity35 , the @entity36 and @entity37 there is increasing concern that sufferers in their 70s and 80s are being written off by @entity51 , chief executive at @entity52 , said : ‘ this is truly depressing			2
one in two of us will get cancer in our lifetime so this is a big deal and has to be a wake - up call for the @entity57			2
there is no reason why the @entity8 should lag behind the rest of @entity10 when it comes to either certain cancers or survival rates for older cancer patients			1
’ the new data is from a major @entity10 study of 10million cancer patients in 29 countries between 2000 and 2008			1
for breast cancer , it found that @entity8 women have a 79 per cent chance of surviving five years , compared with 86 per cent in @entity21 , 87 per cent in @entity73 , 85 per cent in @entity74 and 82 per cent on average			1
only 9 per cent of lung cancer patients in the @entity8 live beyond five years , compared with the 13 per cent average , 17 per cent in @entity78 and 15 per cent in @entity79			1
for prostate cancer , just under 81 per cent of patients in @entity8 live beyond five years			1
the rate is 90 per cent in @entity73 and 89 per cent in @entity21			2
around 68 per cent of over- 75s with breast cancer survive beyond five years , compared with 75 per cent across @entity10			2
about 45 per cent of men over 85 with prostate cancer live for at least five years			0
the average is 58 per cent			0
researchers are unclear as to why our survival rates are so much lower but it may be because the disease is often diagnosed too late when it has spread to other organs			0
it might be that @entity95 are missing certain symptoms while at the same time patients are reluctant to make appointments as they do n’t want to be a nuisance			0
but @entity100 , which runs the health service , said the data , published in the @entity103 , showed some improvements – particularly in lung and skin cancer			0
over the past 13 years the @entity57 has invested millions on various cancer strategies to improve diagnosis rates and make the public more aware of symptoms			0
@entity110 , @entity111 at @entity100 said : ‘ these reports show that we are making real inroads into improving cancer survival in @entity100			0
‘ for example , the improvement in survival in lung cancer has been dramatic over the last 20 years with almost twice as many patients alive a year after diagnosis now as was the case in 1990 and we can see that for melanoma ( skin cancer ) that the survival for @entity100 – 85.3 per cent – is better than the @entity10 average , 83.2 per cent			2
’ but @entity128 , head of policy at @entity130 , said : ‘ there is a shadow to this story			0
while prostate cancer survival rates have improved compared to other cancers , beneath the surface we see worrying indications that @entity8 is lagging behind the @entity10 average on survival rates			1
