travel to the tropics today and you ’ll experience balmy annual mean temperatures of 30 ° @entity4 )			1
but travel there 2.4 billion years ago , and it ’s likely you would have been subjected to @entity9 - like temperatures of -40 ° @entity10 )			1
this so - called ‘ @entity12 ’ theory suggests that our planet was once entirely frozen over - and it could have implications for finding life on other frozen worlds like @entity18 and @entity19			1
a @entity21 scientist led research proposing a new theory			1
it suggests temperatures at @entity12 's equator were -40 ° @entity10 ) 2.4 billion years ago ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
the reasons why the whole planet was frozen are not understood			1
but it could have implications for finding life on frozen moons like europa the research , led by dr @entity36 from the @entity21 , was published in the @entity37			1
it suggests that the entire @entity12 was subjected to a ‘ deep freeze ’ , with the oceans turning into ice 1,000ft ( 300 metres ) thick			2
this means that , were life to survive at the time , it would likely have had to remain in the water deep underground , below this icy crust			2
on other worlds in the solar system such as @entity18 , we see a similar icy crust - and are fairly confident that it , too , has a liquid ocean underground			0
a frozen world , similar to @entity12 , that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life			1
the planet , located 3,000 light years away , is twice as massive as @entity12 and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the @entity12 is from the sun. named @entity66 , the planet ’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. it has been described as the real - life version of ice planet @entity72 featured in @entity74 sequel @entity75			1
but astronomers from @entity77 pointed out that the same planet orbiting a sun - like star would be in the ' habitable zone ' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life			2
and based on this latest ' @entity12 ' , it could suggest there are many more planets that resemble ours 2.4 billion years ago			1
' these events are fascinating			0
we had times where we really had a completely frozen @entity12 , ’ dr @entity36 told @entity91			2
‘ if you go now to tropical regions and you imagine thick glaciers and all the oceans frozen , it ’s crazy i think , but it appears to be that this has happened			2
’ this theory can also help explain a period in @entity12 ’s history known as the @entity102 , 2.2 billion years ago			1
here , oxygen levels began to rapidly rise from 0.0001 per cent of present levels to the 21 per cent of the atmosphere we see today			0
rapid melting across the entirety of @entity12 could have given rise to these increased levels of oxygen in the atmosphere			0
evidence for this latest theory comes from oxygen isotopes studied in rocks in @entity116 and @entity117			2
the exact causes for why the entire @entity12 seemingly froze over are not clear , though			0
speaking to @entity120 , dr @entity119 said before 2.4 billion years ago , the climate of our @entity12 was ‘ normal ’ - similar to the climate we have today			1
and he said a drop in @entity126 levels was likely the cause of @entity12 turning into a snowball			0
' when co2 drops ice caps grow large , ’ he explained			0
‘ because ice is white , a lot of the incoming sunlight is reflected back to space and so large ice caps cause the earth to cool even further			0
‘ climate modelling suggests that at a certain critical point , the @entity12 freezes over completely			2
‘ then , so much sunlight is reflected back to space ( causing such a strong cooling effect ) that the @entity12 becomes a snowball			0
’ the research , led by dr @entity36 from the @entity21 , was published in the @entity37			1
it suggests that the entire @entity12 was subjected to a ‘ deep freeze ’ , with the oceans turning into ice 1,000ft ( 300 metres ) thick ( stock image shown ) it may have been that increased glaciation at the poles produced an opposite ‘ greenhouse effect ’ , with the added ice reflecting more of the sun ’s light and making the planet ever - more cool , allowing the ice to spread			2
volcanic eruptions - or even a supervolcano - could also have reduced the amount of light reaching @entity12 , allowing temperatures to drop			0
it appears that volcanic activity was ultimately responsible for helping @entity12 breaking free of its icy grip , though , increasing global temperatures			0
in fact , dr @entity119 said the amount of melting probably caused @entity12 to go through a ‘ supergreenhouse period ’			0
the ‘ @entity12 ’ theory is not set in stone , though - some have instead suggested it may have been more of a slushball			0
in other words , parts of the planet may have been encased in ice , but open seawater would still have existed in some locations , such as near the equator			2
in @entity12 's past the continents were much closer together , and by 1.1 billion years ago they had formed a supercontinent known as @entity180 ( left )			1
some moons in the solar system such as @entity19 ( right ) are covered in ice today , but believed to have oceans beneath their surface whether such an event could happen again , though , does not look likely			0
dr @entity119 noted that 2.4 million years ago , the sun was not as strong as it is today , allowing the process to take place			1
but a second snowball - like even 600 to 700 million years ago , which was n’t quite as severe , occurred when the sun was almost as strong as it is today			1
‘ so i do n’t know why it should not happen again , ’ he said			0
‘ all you need is an extension of ice caps to a certain threshold level			0
‘ [ but ] considering the man made input of co2 into our atmosphere we are currently heading in another direction , hence a @entity12 climate is currently very unlikely			0

@entity21 scientist led research proposing new theory
it suggests temperatures at the equator were -40 ° c 2.4 billion years ago
the reasons why the whole planet was frozen are not understood
but it could have implications for finding life on frozen moons like europa
