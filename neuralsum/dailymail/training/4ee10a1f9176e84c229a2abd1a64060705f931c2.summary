and while decision to take the relay into a country that is not actually playing host to the @entity11 was met with a few raised eyebrows , a few more questions would have been asked when the honour of carrying the flame was handed to two of @entity19 's less illustrious celebrities			1
singing twins @entity20 - famed more for their haircuts and bad dancing than their voices - were chosen to be among the torchbearers for the prestigious event			1
and with their long spikey - blond quiffs the boisterous pair bore more than a passing resemblance to the iconic torch itself			1

' i 'm really pleased we came here			0
i felt it was a right thing to do			0
' this is a country that 's excellent at sport			0
you 've got an extraordinary history in sport and having @entity119 run with it this morning symbolises what it 's all about			0
' @entity158 @entity157 welcomed the torch to @entity161 , which @entity188 visited last year			1
' the symbolism is so powerful , ' said mr @entity157			0
' it epitomises in so many ways what the @entity11 actually stand for - higher , faster and stronger - for all of those young people who can be inspired by sport , that they take up to become world champions			0
' it 's an enormous commitment for split - second timing to be the best in the world and to achieve @entity2 glory and therefore , like @entity77 , everybody knows him because of his achievements in 1956			0

' @entity208 : @entity108 is joined by officials as he holds the @entity112 aloft on a skywalk above @entity113 the choice of @entity212 as one of the torchbearers was met with widespread derision the staging of the relay in @entity49 will cost some 80,000 euro ( £ 65,000 ) in addition to policing costs			1
mr @entity220 said the @entity221 would be spending some € 30,000 ( £ 24,000 ) and that a further € 25,000 ( £ 20,000 ) had been put forward by both the @entity222 and @entity223 towards the costs			0
this evening the torch will be taken to @entity226 from where it will cross to @entity229 tomorrow			1
@entity20 's involvement comes after yesterday it emerged that some of the coveted places have been handed out by sponsors to their own staff			0
@entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 have distributed the positions to everyone from marketing executives to it workers			0
the remaining 800 places were given to stakeholders , such as the @entity244 , as well as to top sponsors to distribute internally			0
these were then doled out to employees , most of whom appear to have been nominated for simply doing their job and several of whom have no connection to @entity253			0
@entity255 2012 guidelines state that even internal candidates should be ’ young people or have stories inspiring young people ’ with ‘ back stories of personal achievement ’			0
but instead of torchbearer places going to deserving customers or staff of the sponsors , in many instances they have been bestowed on top executives			0
