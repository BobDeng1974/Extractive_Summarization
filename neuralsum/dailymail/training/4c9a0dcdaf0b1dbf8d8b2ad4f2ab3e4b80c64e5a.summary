by @entity0 ever wondered what happens when you flush a toilet on a plane - or if interference from phones is the real reason they are banned on flights ? a new book , written by airline pilot @entity10 , takes some of the most frequently asked questions and answers them in the form of anecdotes and rants			1
called @entity17 , it features chapters on terrorism , fares , delays and common myths as well as giving an exclusive insight into how planes fly and what can cause them to crash			1
a new book called @entity17 , written by airline pilot and @entity10 , attempts to answer questions about planes , including how they fly , how the toilets flush and the ' truth about delays			1
this image shows a stock photo of a cockpit there has been much debate about whether the energy emitted from mobile phones can cause electronic systems on planes , and even in hospitals , to crash or malfunction			2
on this subject @entity10 says in his book : ' few rules are more confounding to airline passengers than those regarding the use of cell phones and portable electronic devices			1
' passengers should know that the restrictions pertaining to computers , ipods , and certain other devices are n’t about electronic interference			0
' the main reasons laptops need to be put away is to prevent them from becoming high - speed projectiles in the event of an impact or sudden deceleration			0
' your computer is a piece of luggage , and luggage needs to be stowed so it does n’t kill somebody or get in the way			0
' he continues that although cellular communication can ' potentially ' interfere with cockpit equipment , ' in all likelihood ' it does n't			1
he also adds that the machines and electronics in airplanes and cockpits have been designed to shield against any interference			2
this means the authorities are ' erring on the better - safe - than - sorry side ' because although there have been no proven cases where a phone has ' adversely affected the outcome of a flight ' , @entity10 believes that ' you never know			1
' in his book @entity17 , airline pilot @entity10 explains that although passengers are told to switch their phones off during flights because they can ' potentially ' interfere with the plane 's systems , ' in all likelihood ' they do n't and that authorities are erring on the side of ' better safe than sorry ' one example @entity10 gives is if the shielding is old or does n't work properly , then the protection could suffer and this could potentially lead to problems			1
' the policy is clearly stated , but obviously unenforced , and we assume the risks are minimal or else phones would be collected or inspected visually rather than relying on the honor system , ' said @entity10			1
' i ’d venture to guess at least half of all phones , whether inadvertently or out of laziness , are left on during flight			2
that ’s about a million phones a day in the @entity117			0
' if indeed this was a recipe for disaster , i think we ’d have more evidence by now			0
' the book also tackles the subject of turbulence			2
@entity10 explained : ' conditions might be annoying and uncomfortable , but the plane is not going to crash			1
turbulence is an aggravating nuisance for everybody , including the crew , but it ’s also , for lack of a better term , normal			2
' @entity10 's book goes into detail about airfares , congestion and plane delays			1
talking about airline service , @entity10 said : ' the average passenger does n't expect to be pampered			1
what he or she expects , and deserves , are convenience , respectful employees , and a modicum of comfort ' planes are engineered to handle turbulent conditions and the level of turbulence required to dislodge an engine or bend a wing spar is something even the most frequent flyer wo n’t experience in a lifetime of traveling			0
' during the 1980s , toilets on planes used a blue liquid that pushed waster from the bowl into a storage tank			0
this liquid added weight to the aircraft , which consumed more fuel , and if it leaked , frozen blocks of waste could end up falling over town and cities			0
on modern - day planes , such as the ones @entity10 flies , this toilet system has been replaced by a vacuum			2
when the toilet is flushed a valve opens to a sewer pipe and the waste is sucked into a tank			0
the waste is then stored in the tank until the plane lands and ground crew vacuum it out and dispose of it			0
and on the subject of doors opening mid-flight , @entity10 stresses the point that : ' you can not – repeat , can not – open the doors or emergency hatches of an airplane in flight			1
you ca n’t open them for the simple reason that cabin pressure wo n’t allow it			0
think of an aircraft door as a drain plug , fixed in place by the interior pressure			0

@entity10 wrote the book to dispel common myths around flying
it covers topics including terrorism , airfares , turbulence and delays
in the book , @entity10 claims phones ' potentially ' interfere with systems but in ' all likelihood ' do n't
he adds that everyday turbulence could not bring down a plane and it 's *impossible* to open doors during flight
