but the arrival of @entity10 was n't easy as @entity8 was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia , seven weeks before her due date			1

happily after a 25 minute operation @entity10 was born but only weighed 2lb and was rushed to the special care unit at the @entity55 in @entity56 , which is close to the family home			2
@entity10 is still being kept in an incubator but has managed to put on enough weight which means she will be allowed home in a few weeks			2
