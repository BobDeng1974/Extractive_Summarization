by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:12 est , 3 february 2014 @entity3 is 78 year old pensioner who loves knitting , organ music - and a toy boy half her age			1
the divorced grandmother from @entity9 met husband @entity10 , 39 , through their shared passion for organ music and they both agree it was ' love at first sight '			1
the couple have made headlines around the world due to their 39 year age gap and now they are sharing their story in a new @entity22 documentary			1
he admits : ' i did like ladies but i had n't had any success in any way			2
' that all changed when he met @entity3 , who was nearly 70 at the time			1
they snuck off from an organ recital to share their first kiss under the pier and have been inseparable ever since			0
' i ca n't imagine being without @entity10 , he 's the first thing i see in the morning and the last thing i see at night , ' @entity3 said			1
@entity3 admitted their age gap ' does n't affect things in the bedroom ' , while @entity10 jokes they are ' at it like rabbits			1
' he added : ' you have to have a sense of humour about sex as it 's a ridiculous thing anyway			2
' toy boy : @entity54 , 68 , and @entity55 , 29 , met through @entity56 but despite their active sex life , there will never be children			1
something that @entity3 feared could have kept them apart			1
' i told him to leave me because it would mean he could n't have children - but thank god he did n't , ' she said			1
@entity3 needs a walking aid to get around and she said her lack of mobility can be frustrating			1
but @entity10 says it does n't bother him and he does n't notice the physical differences in their ages , nor worries that he could face decades without his true love			1
he explains : ' i have physically disabilities which mean my body has aged faster than someone else my age			2
so i will probably have a shorter life span			2
we 'll just keep going as long as we can			0
' while their union may be unusual , it is not unique , as the @entity22 documentary also shares the story of pensioner @entity85 , 68 , who has had a relationship with @entity87 , 29 for the past 18 months			1
' i wanted to be with someone who make me laugh and did n't make me feel like i 'm older ' the couple live together in @entity90 , @entity91 , after meeting via @entity56			1
@entity54 had been married to her husband , @entity92 , for 50 years and they had four children together			1
when he died of cancer four years ago , he made her promise to keep living her life to the full and not become a lonely widow			2
she explains : ' on his death bed he told me to get new boobs and a lovely toy boy			1
he told me , " i 'll be looking down on you smiling , saying good for you @entity54 "			0
he made me write it down in front of him and sign it			0
' @entity54 fulfilled her husband 's dying wishes by getting a breast enlargement and went online to seek a new man			2
she said : ' i get on with young people so i wanted a toy boy			1
i was going for someone who would make me laugh and not make me feel like i 'm older			0
i went on @entity56 and got 700 messages from guys but they were n't what i wanted			1
' however , she was then contacted by @entity119 he said : ' when i first saw picture i was attracted to her so i sent her a message and it started from there			0
' in love : both pensioners say being with a younger man makes them feel young and happy @entity54 said : ' i thought , he 's gorgeous , i would n't mind him			1
' the couple went on a date and hit it off instantly			0
' my legs were like jelly i thought , " he 's the one i 'm having , " ' @entity54 recalls			0
now she says they ca n't keep their hands off each other			2
' we do a lot of kissing and cuddling			0
i do like having sex with him and he does as much as he can , ' she said			2
' i love him to bits and we get on so well			1
' @entity54 said she likes to try and stay young for @entity55 by exercising daily and using sunbeds as she believes a tan gives her a youthful look			1
she also likes to dress in ' sexy style clothes '			0
she explains : ' i like young stuff			0
people will say you are too old to wear something like that leave it to the younger people but that 's not how i feel			2
i do n't want to look like mutton dressed as lamb but if i can dress young and it looks nice i 'm me , i 'll buy it			2
' the pensioner admits her desire to hold back the years is part insecurity over @entity55 leaving her for a younger woman , particularly if he wants to start a family			1
' i liked her straight away but i was only 16 , she was 45 i never thought in a million years that was going to happen ' but he assured her : ' it costs half a million to bring up a kid today			0
think what i could do with that			0
' she also found reassurance from his mother who was surprisingly content about her son dating a woman more than twice his age			1
' i was insecure i kept thinking he would leave me			2
but i spoke to his mum and she told me she had never seen him so much in love and that i should n't worry , ' @entity54 said			1
@entity55 added that his mother is happy he found @entity54 as he needs constant support because he has epilepsy			1
caused controversy : @entity187 first met husband @entity188 when he was 16 and she was 45 he said : ' my previous relationship with girls my own age were terrible because they said they could handle my epilepsy but deep down they could n't			1
they would panic if i had a bad fit			0
if i have n't met someone like @entity195 would have been single for the rest of my life			1
my mum is glad @entity54 looks after me			0
' but another couple featured on the show have n't had as much understanding from friends and family because of the difference in their years			2
@entity187 , 53 , from @entity207 , met her husband @entity208 , 24 , when he was only 16 as he was a friend of the family			1
she was a 45 - year - old mother at the time who was struggling with the symptoms of @entity213			2
@entity188 said : ' i liked her straight away but i was only 16 , she was 45 i never thought in a million years that was going to happen			0
' however , one day when @entity188 was visiting the family he went to see @entity187 to check she was ok when she was having a lie down because of her condition and a kiss ' just happened			0
' the pair soon became an item and @entity187 said she had no regrets despite the shock it caused to their friends and family			0
endured nasty comments : the couple , now aged 53 and 24 , wish people would be more accepting of their relationship she said : ' 16 is a legal age			2
men have been doing it for generations and getting away with it			0
' she added that @entity188 was mature for his age and not like other 16 - year - olds			0
he has certainly had to grow up fast thanks to the relationship which has led to him facing taunts and even once being physically attacked			0
he said : ' quickly my friends all disappeared , they all turned their backs on me			0
it was like society rejected us			0
it was like we had a disease and people would catch it			0
' @entity187 added : ' people used to shout at him " granny shagger " and make nasty comments to me saying it 's dirty and wrong			0
a few times we 've had to call the police			0
once some men set upon him			0
' the couple - like the others featured in the documentary - wish people would be more understanding and accepting of their love			0
' we are just two normal people who fell in love with each other - just with an age gap , ' @entity187 said			1
