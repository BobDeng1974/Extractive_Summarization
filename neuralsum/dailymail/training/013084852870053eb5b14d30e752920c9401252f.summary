dr @entity1 's first reaction on discovering that her twin sons had chickenpox was to consider the logistics			1
the scenario will be familiar to lots of working parents : children with chickenpox are meant to stay at home until all the spots have crusted over and they are no longer contagious , as the disease is dangerous to pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems			1
as the disease is often passed from sibling to sibling , this can mean a parent taking several weeks off work			1
the twins 5 days before @entity21 ( left ) died as a result of contracting chickenpox when he was just two and a half			1
@entity21 's twin brother @entity26 ( right ) also became critically ill but survived in fact , @entity1 's sons , @entity21 and @entity26 , then aged two - and - a - half , had contracted the virus at the start of a family holiday on the @entity32 , which was a relief as it meant neither she nor her husband would need to take time off work to care for them			1
but while her otherwise healthy twins coped well for the first two days of their illness , on the third day @entity21 developed a persistent high fever and started to vomit			1
' he was just not himself , grizzly and saying he was hot and did n't feel well , ' says @entity1 , a gp from @entity43			1
strongly suspecting @entity21 was seriously ill , she took him to hospital			1
' when i arrived they told me they did n't want a child with chickenpox there and i should take him to the gp			1
' it 's the only time i 've ever done it , but i said : “ i am a gp , and i am worried about him			0
” the staff were really off with me , put me in a side room and left me there			0
' @entity42 dr @entity1 watched as doctors tried to save her son nearly four hours later , @entity21 was seen by a consultant , who immediately realised the severity of his condition			1
the little boy was given anti-viral drugs via a drip , but as he was being prepared for transfer to a larger hospital in @entity67 , his condition suddenly deteriorated and he died just as he was about to be put into an ambulance			2
' they 'd said they thought it would be nicer for him to be asleep for the transfer so they gave him an anaesthetic , ' says @entity1			1
' i 'd told him he was going to have a little sleep and that when he woke up we would be home			0
he just said “ night , night , @entity79 ” and for that moment he seemed much brighter			0
' it 's a comfort to me because he was obviously not frightened			0
but it was shortly after then that the doctors realised they were losing him			0
i was in the room and watched as they tried to save him			0
' @entity21 died from encephalitis - swelling of the brain - a rare complication of chickenpox that happens when the virus reaches the brain			1
it might have been treatable had he been given anti-viral drugs when he 'd arrived at hospital			0
@entity1 , her husband @entity96 and their two older children 's grief and distress was further compounded because the same day @entity21 died , @entity26 became critically ill with encephalitis , too			1
' there ca n't be many worse situations to be in as a parent , ' she says			0
@entity26 survived , but for the next seven years suffered fits as a result of the damage caused by scarring to his brain			1
now 16 , he 's not had a fit for six years and is a bright and sporty teenager			2
@entity1 still has no idea why her twins reacted so badly to the virus , but her experience was far from unique			1
' after @entity21 died i wrote a piece for @entity119 , the @entity120 , to raise awareness of how serious chickenpox can be and got inundated by people who had their own horror stories , ' she says			1
' until then , i thought we had been really , really unlucky , and then i realised it was n't just us			0
' there are vaccines against chickenpox			2
indeed , many experts argue in favour of vaccination - something that has been routine for children in the @entity134 for 20 years			2
and no one is a more staunch supporter than dr @entity1			1
while she 's keen to stress that for the majority of children chickenpox is a mild illness , she feels people should know that for some youngsters it can be life - threatening , even fatal			2
however , the chickenpox vaccine is not available on the @entity146 for otherwise healthy youngsters , and can be done only privately , at up to £ 250 for each child			2
the government 's @entity149 last considered introducing the jab on the @entity146 in 2010 , but ruled that it was not cost - effective as so few children become dangerously ill. a 2007 study estimated chickenpox caused serious complications - including encephalitis , pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections - in fewer than one in 10,000 @entity160 researchers from @entity161 and the universities of @entity163 and @entity164 found 112 children who had serious complications of chickenpox			2
but excluding one baby that died in the womb and four that had existing chronic health problems , such as @entity175 or cerebral palsy , it seemed only one healthy child died , out of a total population of more than ten million			2
@entity1 , however , argues that the real figures are likely to be much higher			1
' i think there 's a huge amount of under - reporting , ' she says			0
' my little boy 's death certificate had " viral illness " written on it , so he would n't have hit the statistics even though it was entirely caused by chickenpox			2
' in her gp practice , she typically sees two serious cases of chickenpox a year , slightly more than meningitis			2
the twins ( @entity21 on right ) on holiday with sister @entity197 , brother @entity198 and mum last week an inquest into the death of seven - year - old @entity203 from @entity204 in @entity200 heard how the otherwise healthy child may have died from a fit triggered by chickenpox just 24 hours after she broke out in spots			1
another argument against widespread vaccination is that it could lead to a rise in the number of elderly people developing the often - debilitating condition shingles , where nerves and the skin around them become infected			0
this happens because the varicella - zoster virus , which causes chickenpox , remains in the body after you 've had the illness			2
while most people wo n't get chickenpox again , it can be reactivated as shingles - commonly in old age or when your immune system is compromised			2
little and frequent exposure to the varicella - zoster virus through being around those with chickenpox keeps the body primed to fight it			2
but if this is eliminated because of widespread vaccination , the theory is that shingles will become more common			0
a persistently high fever of above 38.5 degrees			0
vomiting , which is a sign the brain may be affected			0
significant coughing , an indication the infection has spread to the lungs			0
often these symptoms come four or five days after catching chickenpox			0
this is disputed by @entity247 , a professor of paediatrics at @entity249 , specialising in invasive infections in children and clinical trials of vaccines			0
' in the @entity134 , because of vaccination chickenpox is virtually unheard of now and studies have revealed that while shingles has increased a little , it is not nearly as much as was predicted			0
' for professor @entity247 the answer to whether to vaccinate against it is a straightforward ' yes '			0
' it 's a horrible disease , ' he says			0
' many of my colleagues - paediatricians - bring their own children to my clinic to be vaccinated because they 've seen how it can be			0
' however , dr @entity267 , a gp and author of @entity269 , believes chickenpox is simply not serious enough to warrant a vaccination programme			1
the twins at play ( @entity21 on right ) about to reach their second birthday he says the chickenpox jab is more sought after because it 's an inconvenience for parents to take time off work			1
he does offer the chickenpox jab at his children 's immunisation clinic @entity281 , but admits : ' it would be low in my priorities			0
it 's up to you , but it 's generally a mild illness and your child is unlikely to come to any serious harm			0
' he believes natural immunity from having a disease is always better and longer - lasting than from the vaccine and says while protection from the chickenpox jab should last at least ten years , it potentially just pushes the illness into an older age bracket			1
and chickenpox can be very nasty for adults			0
professor @entity247 disagrees : ' there are no advantages to getting it naturally			0
' as for chickenpox ' parties ' - where mothers encourage their children to socialise with youngsters with chickenpox so they catch it - @entity1 is far from convinced			1
' i try not to frighten mums who come to see me , but you just do n't know if your child is going to be the one who reacts in the way @entity21 did			1
' @entity1 says she tries not to frighten mums who come to see her , but you just do n't know if your child is going to be the one who reacts in the way @entity21 did			1

dr @entity1 ' twin son @entity21 died of chickenpox when he was just five
brother @entity26 also contracted disease and suffered fits for years
