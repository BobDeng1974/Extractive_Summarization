@entity0 shot a fine 66 in the first round of the @entity2 on thursday – but still found himself upstaged by his playing partner , @entity3			1
competing for the first time in one of the star groups , the 28 - year - old @entity4 admitted he was nervous at the prospect of teeing it up alongside world no 1 @entity0 and @entity12 champion @entity11			1
it certainly did n’t show once he was one the course as he posted a wonderful 65 to set the early lead alongside @entity17 @entity16 and @entity18 , who demonstrated just why he is looking forward to this season so much			1
@entity19 started off with a solid 66 at the @entity2 the @entity20 plays a shot during the first round of the tournament on thursday @entity3 had one eagle and five birdies in a bogey - free round but the best shot he played might have been a deft chip to six feet from a precarious spot at the sixth that allowed him to save par. ‘ i was very impressed with his game , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s the first time i ’d seen @entity3 play and i like the fact he can move the ball both ways from the tee , while his putting stroke is just pure			1
’ @entity3 first hit the headlines last year with a hole in one that won him a trip into space			1
he certainly reached the heights when he started this campaign by claiming his first win on tour in the @entity48 to fully earn his starting time among the elite			2
not that the modest @entity51 saw it that way			2
‘ i thought they ’d messed up the draw when i saw that i ’d been paired with @entity0 and @entity11 but it turned into one of the best days of my life , ’ he said			2
‘ they made me feel so comfortable and to play so well was just brilliant			2
to be honest , i did n’t look at a leaderboard all day			0
i was just enjoying watching @entity0 and @entity11 play			0
' now i want to play alongside these guys more and more			0
it brings out the best in my game			0
’ @entity3 ( pictured ) set an early lead alongside @entity17 @entity16 and @entity18 joint leader @entity16 plays a shot during the first round of the tournament @entity11 , in his first round since his @entity71 meltdown , showed all his class with a 67 while @entity0 was a little irritated that a blemish - free performance was ruined by a bogey at his final hole , the ninth on the card			1
‘ it ’s not the way you want to finish , obviously , but i ’m happy enough with my score , ’ he said			2
‘ i started off slowly and did n’t hit a fairway until my eighth hole			2
but it got better as it went along			0
the fifth and sixth are two of the hardest holes on the course but @entity0 made them look easy with successive birdies			0
@entity18 told @entity90 in the build - up that he was relishing the prospect of this season more than any other in recent times and certainly made a good start with a flawless 65			1
‘ one of the joys of living in @entity99 is you do n’t come out in your opening tournament trying to get rid of any rust , ’ he said			0
@entity18 takes a break during the first round of the @entity2 on thursday @entity105 follows his ball on the 13th hole during round one of the @entity2 ‘ you get to play a lot of winter golf to keep sharp and that has shown today			1
’ so did the @entity112 @entity105 , who is trying to become just the sixth player in @entity115 history to win the same event three years in a row			0
he got his quest off on the right foot with a fine 66 , including an eagle three on the par - five 13th			1
it means in 13 rounds on this course , @entity105 has now played the hole in 14 under par. ‘ that ’s just mad , is n’t it ? ’ said the @entity126 man			0
‘ to be honest , i wish i did n’t know that			0
it ’s certainly put the pressure on tomorrow			0
