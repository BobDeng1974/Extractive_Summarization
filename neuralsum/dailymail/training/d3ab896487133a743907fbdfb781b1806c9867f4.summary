' @entity37 was playing in a friendly game between his team @entity39 and @entity40 on august 14 when he suddenly collapsed			2

so far no arrests have been made			0
mr @entity28 , who was on the touchline at @entity55 's @entity80 when his son 's leg was sliced almost to the bone , is now calling for bladed studs to be banned			1
the supermarket worker , who lives with wife @entity86 , 42 , a nurse in @entity87 , @entity88 , said : ' i was in a daze , to be honest			0
' @entity6 was such a brave lad			2
i think he was in shock , but he kept on telling the people around him , " look after my dad "			0
he was worried about me			0
' a lot of people felt physically sick			0
even the linesman had to turn away because he felt ill. ' i just do n't want any other youngster to go through this			0
' i ca n't help thinking the injury would not have been so severe if the other player was wearing good old fashioned moulded studs			2
' we do n't know when @entity6 will play again - he 's hobbling at the moment			1
when it happened , he said he wanted to quit football			2
concerned : @entity6 with his father @entity28 who was worried the blade had severed an artery because there was so much blood ' but it 's a one - off injury , something like that will never happen to him again			1
we do know he will be scarred for life			0
' his comments echo recently retired @entity118 manager sir @entity117 who claimed @entity120 defender @entity119 could have killed star striker @entity121 when he kicked the ball at his head last season			0
but schoolboy @entity6 yesterday shrugged off the incident , which happened just 20 minutes into his debut for the club			2
wound : the gash on @entity6 's left leg before it was stitched up he said : ' i 'm ok really , i just ca n't wait to get back out on the pitch again			1

i ran out to smother the ball and he came running through , did n't even slide , he just stamped on me			0
' i got up and started hopping around and pulled my shorts up to just see my skin hanging off			0
' that 's when i started screaming			2
' @entity141 manager @entity52 , 41 , believes the cut was just centimetres away from an artery			0
he said : ' it was literally centimetres away from an artery - that is how close it was to being something much more serious			2
' i think bladed boots should be banned from kids ' football			1
' kids wear them on paths and gravel and the blades become sharp , almost like a weapon			0
' the referee 's report from the abandoned game said the tackle was a result of ' youthful over-enthusiasm '			2
a spokesman for the @entity166 club described the injury as ' terrible ' but stressed there was no malice behind the challenge that caused it			0
he said : ' i think people reacted to the injury - and , yes , it was very bad			0
but it was not the result of violent play			0
' a spokesperson for @entity69 police said : ' we can confirm we are investigating an allegation of assault in relation to this incident			1
' there have been no arrests made but the football boots the 13 - year - old was wearing at the time have been seized as part of the investigation			1
' the horrific injury was similar to that caused to @entity118 star @entity193 by the bladed boots of @entity196 's @entity195 last season			1
blades are meant to provide players with better grip than their studded counterparts but the boots have come under fire for being both dangerous to player 's opponents as well as to themselves			1
a study by researchers at @entity208 found that the traditional stud was safer in a series of tests involving amateur players			0
researchers claimed the traditional stud helps to distribute the pressure being placed on a footballer 's feet while the cleats increase the loading on the front of the foot where soccer stars are prone to metatarsal injuries			0
meanwhile bladed boots were ' relatively more harmful ' due to the unnatural increased loading under the lateral half of the foot			1
professor @entity226 , of the university 's @entity227 , said : ' the additional pressures placed on that area of the foot predispose it to injury			0
' our study showed that studded boots can be considered safer , as the pressure distribution across the foot and the pattern of pressure progression mimicked the normal motif , whereas the same was not true of bladed boots			1
' in 2005 , sir @entity117 called for the boots to be banned after @entity243 broke a bone in his foot			2
speaking at the time , he said : ' the shot of the injury shows the shape of a blade stud on @entity243 's foot			0
the bladed studs are a danger			0
' we have strong views about this , we do n't allow our players to wear them as they can cause serious injuries			0
' we have photographs in the dressing room of some of the injuries caused by blades			0
some of our academy boys had bad injuries , including some terrible facial injuries			0
' hopefully the fad will evaporate and they will think of something else			0
' but eight years on , bladed boots are still popular among both professional and amateur players .			1
