when two bombs exploded near the @entity8 finish line in april , spraying metal shards , nails and ball bearings into a crowd of thousands , the technicians did n't have time to deploy bomb x-ray machines			1
putting their own lives at risk , @entity16 bomb squad sergeant @entity15 and his team frantically knifed open a minefield of backpacks by hand in search of more devices to prevent another devastating blast			1
frantic : bomb technicians frantically cut open backpacks and bags searching for bombs to prevent a third blast at the @entity8 in april brave : @entity16 bomb squad sergeant @entity15 and his team cut open bags and backpacks with a knife in search of bombs the so - called hand entry - a @entity38 - style search for the red wire - is not standard procedure , according to an exclusive report by @entity42			1
in an average operation , a team of bomb technicians will spend several hours disassembling a single device			1
but after surveying the scene , @entity15 quickly realized every bag could be hiding a device and ' blind hand entry ' was the only option to save lives			2
' if two [ bombs ] , why not three ? ' @entity15 thought as he tore into the bags with a knife			2
he avoided zippers , which could be a trigger , as he cut into the base of the packs			1
@entity15 was about one of about a dozen bomb techs stationed at the finish line before the april 15 @entity8 commenced			1
earlier that morning , the team had searched the area for bombs - peering inside trash cans , peeking into car and store windows and inspected flower planters			2
that is standard procedure in the post- 9/11 world			1
the team felt it was ready for any potential bomb threat as about half a million spectators turned out to watch nearly 25,000 athletes run the @entity8			1
but according to @entity42 , the @entity16 bombings was the ' worst day of their lives ' that required an unorthodox response			1
for technician @entity88 , seeing twisted sheet metal and a battery among the debris after the bombings - so obviously out of place among the discarded shoes and jackets of the runners - was a sign the bomb had been hidden in a backpack			2
' well , now i know what i ’m looking for , ' he thought			0
he told himself : ' @entity88 , this is @entity96 history in the making , and you ’re smack - dab in the middle of it			0
now do n’t f * * * this up , ’ cause you ’d rather be dead than have another one of these go off			0
' meanwhile , @entity15 was still cutting up bags			0
' i ’m gon na f * * * * * * die , ' he thought			0
' one of these is gon na be real			0
if it goes , it goes			0
that ’s just the way it ’s going to be today			0
' that 's when he realized he needed more technicians to clear the bags , and put in a desperate call for back - up			2

fresh from training with a retired @entity135 bomb technician who taught his unit how to assess and cut into suspicious packages found near victims at a still - warm blast scene , @entity131 knew he had to check the bags			1
with only a cheap blade in his pocket , he ran up to backpacks in the crowd , placed his body between bags and a victim prone on the ground and cut			2
about 45 bomb technicians and 40 k - 9 handlers had answered @entity16 police 's call for help			1
over the next few days , technicians pulled off grueling 16 - hour days to keep up with reports of suspicious packages around time			1
the bomb squad deployed sophisticated equipment , including the @entity161 , a portable x-ray unit powered by a @entity164 battery from a cordless drill , for the more suspicious looking packages			1
the week after the marathon , @entity15 met with the police commissioner to review the bomb squad ’s performance			2
he was worried they had missed the pressure cookers used by the bombers during that morning ’s sweep of @entity175 where the bombs hit			0
they had n’t , but many in the team still felt guilty			0
' bombs went off in our city , ' @entity180 says			0
' we ’re the bomb squad			0
i wish we could have prevented it			0
' devastation : firefighters on @entity188 near the finish line after two bombs exploded			0

more than a dozen technicians from the @entity16 police , @entity194 , and state police frantically searched backpacks by hand for *explosives* on the day of the @entity8 bombings
ripping open bags with a knife is not standard procedure , but officers could n't risk another *explosion*
technicians avoided zippers which could have been a trigger
bomb *detonation* *technology* was used for the most suspicious packages
