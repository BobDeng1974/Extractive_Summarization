@entity0 will be forced to reveal who leaked the @entity2 : age of @entity5 trailer after @entity6 was granted a court order to compel the information			1
a federal judge approved the @entity12 - owned company 's request for a far - reaching subpoena against the tech giant two weeks after the video was made public before it 's scheduled release date			1
@entity6 said in court documents that someone using the name ' @entity20 ' posted a file of the film , which stars @entity23 and @entity24 , on a @entity26 account			2
pictured is @entity5 , the titular villain in the new movie a @entity12 lawyer sent @entity0 a takedown notice requesting the tech company to remove the file due to breach of copyright			1
the subpoena , issued two days ago , said @entity0 has to bring ' all identifying information for the user ' @entity20 ' to court on november 18 in @entity47			1
but judge @entity48 did not grant @entity6 's request to ' permit entry onto the designated premises , land , or other property possessed or controlled by you at the time , date , and location set forth			0
' @entity0 was told : ' you are commanded to produce at the time , date , and place set forth below the following documents , electronically stored information , or objects , and to permit inspection , copying , testing , or sampling of the material			1
' ironic : the clip begins with @entity5 stating , ' i 'm gon na show you something beautiful ' a subpoena is a writ issued by a government agency , most often a court , which has the authority to compel testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure			0
it is possible that the company is looking for an infringer either inside @entity6 or @entity12 or a production house handling the prized trailer			1
after the leak , @entity6 released the official version of the trailer the same day - days ahead of its schedule debut			2
the leaked video paints a bleak and eerie picture for the sequel to the hit 2012 @entity6 film			0
the band of superheroes can be seen looking defeated and on the verge of giving up hope as the world around them goes to chaos			0
dejected : the band of superheroes can be seen looking defeated and on the verge of giving up hope as the world around them goes to chaos bleak : in one scene , @entity106 ( the @entity107 ) , @entity108 ( @entity109 ) , @entity24 ( @entity110 ) , and @entity111 ( @entity112 ) can be seen idling in an aircraft , appearing limp and utterly dejected in the @entity117 directed film which debuts may 2015 , @entity116 ( @entity23 ) tries to jump - start a dormant peacekeeping program and things go awry , according to @entity121			0
' it is up to @entity2 to stop the villainous @entity5 from enacting his terrible plans			2
' and this is no easy task , as @entity5 , voiced by @entity125 , certainly seems to have the upper hand for much of the film			0
he narrates the video in an ominous and gravelly voice , relishing the destruction he has caused .			0
