by @entity0 the unique twists , turns and layers of @entity5 ’s rocky terrain have been caught on 3d camera by a motorised glider			1
a pair of @entity10 pilots mounted the specialist @entity12 ( @entity12 ) to the wing of a @entity16 - @entity15 glider before making the trip over @entity5 ’s summit - 8,848 metres above sea level			1
footage from the camera will now be used to build a high - quality 3d model of the @entity23 mountain , with a resolution down to 15 centimetres			1
researchers plan to use this footage to build a 3d model of the @entity23 mountain with a resolution down to 15 centimetres @entity5 is the tallest of the so - called ‘ eight - thousanders ’ - at 8,848 metres - and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared			1
@entity5 ’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the @entity39 subcontinent began a slow - motion collision with @entity41			2
the edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the @entity45 today			0
glaciers have chiselled @entity5 ’s summit into a huge , triangular pyramid , defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast , southeast , and northwest			2
the southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route			0
it is the one @entity55 and @entity56 followed in may 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely			2
researchers plan to use this model to help improve forecasts of landslides and floods resulting from the outbursting of glacial lakes			1
the scheme was set up by the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) and researchers from the @entity71 , also known as @entity71 ( @entity71 )			0
@entity69 pilot @entity72 and co-pilot @entity73 took an hour and a half to reach the summit , after taking off from the expedition base camp at @entity77 in @entity23 on 28 january			1
they flew the glider along the @entity45 towards @entity5 before using mountain waves to gradually gain altitude			1
' the conditions were ideal , despite the wind speeds at the summit of @entity5 , which neared 100 kilometres per hour , ' said @entity72			1
' the almost turbulence - free slope updrafts helped us ascend quickly			0
' the @entity12 camera system , developed and built by @entity71 , was fitted to the glider in an unpressurised instrument container under the wing			2
its three camera heads , arranged facing toward each other at a lateral slant , give a 120 - degree field - of - view and can take high - resolution images of steep slopes			2
the @entity16 - @entity15 glider , pictured , was mounted with a specialist @entity100 ( @entity12 ) built by the @entity71			0
the 3d model will be used to help improve forecasts of landslides and floods resulting from the outbursting of glacial lakes due to the cold temperatures of the @entity45 summits , which can drop to below -35 degrees @entity110 , engineers had to put the camera through a series of tests before the flight could take off			1
this included tests in a vacuum chamber , at moderate altitudes above the @entity119 and while subjected to unusual lighting conditions			0
while the pilots were given a specialist oxygen sysyem designed to help them fly to such high altitudes			0
the pictures from the camera will now be used to create detailed @entity127 computer images of the mountainous regions that the glider passed over			0
to cope with the high altitudes and cold temperatures of the @entity45 , pictured , which can drop to below -35 ° c , engineers put the camera through a series of tests before the flight			0
this included tests in a vacuum chamber , at moderate altitudes above the @entity119 and during unusual lighting conditions the scheme was set up by the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) and researchers from the @entity71			0
pilot @entity72 , left , and co-pilot @entity73 , right , took an hour and a half to reach the summit after taking off from the base camp at @entity77 in @entity23 on 28 january @entity71 has also developed its own software to create these images too , which is currently uses to evaluate data captured by @entity150 observation satellites			1
the first 3d models of the @entity5 flight will be available in the coming weeks			1
the researchers are keeping a blog to provide additional details of their adventurous research expedition to the @entity45			0
the aircraft was supplied by the @entity158 at the @entity159 in @entity160 .			0

the motorised glider was flown by pilots @entity72 and @entity73
3d cameras captured the flight as it travelled over @entity5 *'s* summit
footage will be used to build a 3d model of the @entity23 mountain with a resolution down to 15 centimetres
this model will help improve forecasts of landslides and floods
