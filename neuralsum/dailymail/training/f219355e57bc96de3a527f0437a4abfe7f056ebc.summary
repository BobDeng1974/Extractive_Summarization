@entity8 , 11 , has been left unable or speak or feed himself after staff at @entity11 's @entity10 failed to act swiftly enough when his heart rate dropped			1
his mother @entity13 , now 40 , had gone into labour after a healthy pregnancy on the morning of april 13 , 2001			2
injury : @entity17 has been left unable to speak or feed himself after maternity staff failed to act swiftly enough when his heart rate dropped at birth which led to brain damage but the following day , from late morning , her unborn baby 's heart rate dropped			1
although he was being monitored , it was n’t until around 10pm that evening - when there was a shift change - that specialist help was called for			2
@entity8 was delivered by forceps shortly after 10.45pm , but his heart rate was weak and he suffered brain damage			1
now more than a decade on , the @entity31 , @entity32 , have awarded a £ 6million care package to @entity8 ’s parents			1
the couple , from @entity11 , @entity36 , won their fight to get @entity38 to accept that they were liable for the majority of @entity8 's injuries and that he should have been delivered earlier			1
@entity8 requires round - the - clock care and his parents hope the money will allow them to move to a specially adapted home with their three other children			1
payout : @entity47 's parents @entity13 and @entity48 , pictured outside the @entity49 in @entity32 where they were awarded a £ 6million care package he will also have access to the specialist rehabilitation equipment he needs including the installation of a multi-sensory room that uses light , sounds , smells and shapes to develop his skills with hearing , sight , taste , touch , language and hand - eye co-ordination			1
speaking outside the @entity31 today @entity8 's @entity48 , 39 , said he and his wife were over the moon with the figure they have been given			1
he said : ' we ’ve managed to secure the funding @entity71 needs now to last him for the rest of his life			0
' this money will be used for extra physio appointments , speech therapy , occupational therapy to really try and bring him out so he can live his life to the full			0
mrs @entity13 , a part - time credit manager , who also has two daughters and a younger son , said : ' i can not describe how it feels knowing we finally have justice for @entity85			2
' it is a mixture of huge relief and happiness that he will now always have access to the treatment he deserves and be cared for the rest of his life			0
battle : parents @entity13 and @entity48 , pictured with @entity8 and their other children @entity96 , 9 , @entity97 , 5 , and @entity98 , 2 , fought for over a decade to force the hospital to accept liability ' his brother and sisters are great with @entity85 and love to play with him , but at his age he should be playing and running around with them			1
' it is heartbreaking that he has not been able to meet the normal milestones in his life			0
' this settlement means we will always have support and he will always be cared for , as well as funding all the specialist equipment he needs			0
' however , although it draws a line under everything , nothing can turn back the clock and @entity48 and i will always remember that if the correct decision had been made earlier , @entity85 would be the healthy boy we dreamed of			2
' blunder : the court heard how staff at @entity10 in @entity11 failed to act swiftly enough when @entity8 's heart rate dropped @entity120 , a partner and medical negligence expert at @entity122 who represents the family , said : ' @entity13 and @entity48 have waited patiently and with huge dignity for today ’s settlement , which will make such a big difference to @entity85 ’s life			1
' the adaptations to a new house and one - to - one support will make life easier for the whole family who have given up so much to care for @entity85 and juggled hospital appointments and rehabilitation support with trying to provide a normal family home life			2
' this was a complicated case but the fact is the mistakes made during @entity85 ’s care should simply not have happened			0
' patient safety must be the top priority across the @entity143 , but sadly , we continue to be contacted by families whose children have been left brain damaged as a result of negligent hospital staff , looking for access to the rehabilitation and support they desperately need to live their lives as independently as possible			1
' trusts must ensure thorough training of staff and that guidelines are in place for when to call for senior support , not just for midwives , but all areas of the @entity143			2
' this will reduce basic , preventable errors from happening that have devastating consequences for patients and their families			0
' @entity8 was @entity13 ’s first pregnancy and she said the money was a huge relief and it was devastating at the time			1
she added : ' we were very angry , we were very raw , for a fair few years , we have gone on to have three other healthy children			0
that made it a little bit easier emotionally			0
' it ’s a huge relief today that we can get @entity71 care for the rest of his life and pay the carers to help him in every day living			0
' @entity71 needs 24 - hour care , he has no functional use of his arms , his hands , or anything			0
he has to washed , bathed , gel in his hair , he has to fed , he ca n’t give himself a drink			0
' the apology means a lot , more than anything it means a lot because it ’s that acknowledgement of what they did			0
we fought for this for more than 10 and half years , and it means more than anything			0
