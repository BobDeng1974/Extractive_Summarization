@entity0 is kidnapping thousands of women and young girls to be traded in open markets as sex slaves for as little as £ 16 each , it was revealed today			1
a shocking report by @entity7 lays bare for the first time the true depth of depravity with which is fighters are treating their female captives , tearing them from their families and subjecting them to sustained and violent rape and domestic enslavement			1
puberty is not requisite to be an is sex slave , with girls as young as 12 and their mothers being dragged by their hair onto cattle trucks and herded to a ' sorting office ' where they are classified by age , education and marital status , the @entity16 reported			1
what happens to them thereafter is up to their new owners who are free to abuse , torture , rape or just share them between their friends			2
these are not isolated examples of individual cruelty but an institutionalized policy of wholesale enslavement based on a brutal interpretation of @entity72 law			0
horrific details of the barbarity with which is treats its captives are only now beginning to trickle out thanks to the bravery of a minority of girls who escaped their captors and fled to safety to tell their stories			1
those stories have now been published in @entity7 's report , torture , sexual slavery in @entity0 captivity in @entity90			1
activists are desperately trying to shine a light on the plight of these slaves who hail primarily from @entity90 's minority @entity31 population			1
and they say the is slave drivers include @entity99 converts from the @entity100			1
' i have a case of one escapee who was one of a group of girls bought and raped by two @entity109 brothers from @entity110 , ' @entity101 , a @entity31 former mp , told @entity16			1
' these were not @entity109 of @entity99 origin - these are white - skinned , blond - haired @entity109 : converts			1
' the @entity16 spoke to a number of escapees who all told stories of gang rape and horror			0
rewarded : after being abducted from their homes , they are sold as playthings to the highest bidder , usually is commanders , or gifted to the ' bravest ' fighters as rewards for their services to jihad @entity129 : what happens to them thereafter is up to their new owners who are free to abuse , torture , rape or just share them between their friends they include a 19 - year - old @entity31 woman who recalled the moment she and her sisters were seized from the town of @entity35 , northern @entity90 , prized from their mother 's grasp and sold to a man they knew from their village			1
' my mother started screaming and begging for mercy as the @entity154 ( @entity110 ) fighters told my sister and me to join the group of younger women specially selected , ' @entity149 , as she has been named to protect her identity , said			0
' but they tore us from her grasp			0
i saw other women in the building being dragged to waiting lorries by their hair			2
' @entity165 and her 14 - year - old sister were captured on the first sunday of august as they fled up @entity35 mountain to escape the advancing is horde			1
but before they could reach the safety of the hills they were intercepted and driven to a government building in @entity35 where the selection process began			2
of the men who captured her , her mother , sister and six siblings , the youngest of whom is 11 years old , she said : ' they were local @entity181 fighters , some of whom we recognised			0
a local mechanic was among them			0
' she said she and her 14 - year - old sister were ordered to join a group of both married and unmarried young women			1
' when my mother realised ( what was happening0 she began screaming , ' she said			0
her mother managed to hold on to her 11 - year - old daughter but could not prevent @entity149 and her sister being taken away			0
@entity165 said they were piled onto lorries ' like cattle ' and taken to @entity197 where they were held in another sorting centre , named @entity200			0
horrific : details of the barbarity with which is treats its captives are only now beginning to trickle out thanks to the bravery of a minority of girls who escaped their captors and fled to safety to tell their stories over the following two weeks , they went though another two selection processes before they ended up with about 100 other girls in a house in the town of @entity217 owned by an influential is sheik			1
they were also forced to convert to @entity99			2
they were inspected once more before she was sold to another man she knew called @entity223 , a small - time crook in her hometown who fitted gold teeth to clients including , once , one of her older sisters			2
she and her sister were then taken to his home in @entity232 where they would serve - both sexually and domestically - him and two of his captains			0
' sometimes he would call me by name and talk reasonably , ' she said ' at other times the men would insult our @entity31 faith and curse us			2
if @entity223 was angry , he would strike of kick me			0
once he put his hands around my throat and tried to choke me			0
' that was all she could bring herself to tell the @entity16 before she broke down under the strain of her trauma			0
it was then that a @entity31 care worker told the newspaper 's reporter that the girls had been repeatedly raped over a long period by @entity256 and his underlings			1
they managed to escape in november - three months after their initial capture - by sneaking past a sleeping guard at night and climbing over a wall			0
they walked through the night through the desert and into the @entity35 mountains where they were found by @entity31 fighters who evacuated them to @entity268 by helicopter			1
@entity0 have long denied using sex slaves to services its fighters			0
but , in october , the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the enslavement of captured @entity31 was justified because they are a ' pagan minority '			1
it went on : ' enslaving the families of the kuffar ( non-believers ) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the @entity72			0
' and earlier this month , in its ' @entity285 on taking captives and slaves ' , @entity110 said : ' it is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who has n't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse			2
' activists say some 2,500 girls and women have been captured as sex slaves in the past five months			1
so far , about 430 have escaped			0
about 2,000 @entity31 men are also unaccounted for , believed to have been executed			2
@entity299 , a @entity31 activist helping refugees in @entity268 said : ' we have raped and pregnant cases ; children who have escaped without parents ; parents without children			1
we have cases of women who have been raped by just one @entity154 fighter , and cases of women who have been multiply raped and sold several times among @entity110 fighters			2
we have found women sold for $ 25 ( £ 16 ) , for $ 100 ( £ 64 ) , for $ 1,000 ( £ 640 )			0
' @entity149 has not seen her mother or father since that august day when they were torn apart by @entity110 fighters .			0
