@entity0 spent many years wearing high heel shoes four years ago , a shopping trip was torture for @entity4 , 67			1
though still a super-fit events organiser , the former over- 50s all @entity6 badminton mixed doubles champion was reduced to hobbling at a snail 's pace , hanging onto her trolley for support			0
it may sound as though @entity0 was struggling with a debilitating disease or catastrophic accident			0
in fact , she was suffering from the painful legacy of a lifetime wearing high heels			1
her story is a cautionary tale for those of us who blithely slip our feet into shoes several inches high on a daily basis			2
most women are well aware that wearing high heels for any length of time can result in sore feet , pinched toes and tight calf muscles			1
but a worrying new study by researchers in the @entity34 suggests high heels can also put dangerous pressure on knee joints , wearing away cartilage - the body 's built - in shock absorber - and increasing the risk of osteoarthritis			1
some women need invasive knee replacement surgery			1
in the study carried out by @entity48 's biomotion team , the knees of healthy women were scanned as they walked at normal pace in flat shoes , 1½ in heels and 3½ in heels			2
they found that in high heels , women 's knees are held in such an awkward , bent position that their joints looked and performed like aged or damaged joints - increasing the risk of osteoarthritis			1
physiotherapist and osteopath @entity60 is n't surprised : patients with postural problems caused or exacerbated by heels are common at his @entity66 clinic			1
' because of the odd angle at which the feet are held in high - heeled shoes , it increases the downward pressure on the knees by 25 per cent , placing significant stress on the kneecaps , even when you 're standing still , ' he says			2
at 5ft 3in , @entity0 had always loved the extra height afforded by her favourite heels			2
' i wore vertiginous stilettos and towering platforms every day of my teens and 20s , ' she says			0
' and after that , a 3 in heel or more , whenever i wanted to look smart			2
' even the first twinge of arthritis , which began in her right knee in her early 30s , could n't persuade her to kick her heel habit - instead , she gritted her teeth and controlled the pain with anti- inflammatories , until it suddenly worsened four years ago			1
she had almost no cartilage left in her knee and needed to have a titanium knee replacement ' i was struggling to get out of bed or in and out of the car , ' she says			1
' i sometimes had to use crutches to get about and would have to lean heavily on a trolley to get around the supermarket			0
' all my lovely high - heeled shoes had to be banished and i started living in trainers			2
' my husband @entity102 and my friends were all very sweet , telling me i looked great in my frumpy , flat shoes and encouraging me to get my knee sorted out - but i felt really down about it			2
' if i walked any distance or tried to play badminton , my knee would swell horribly and i 'd have to apply ice packs to control the pain			2
' tests showed that i had almost no cartilage left in my knee and it became obvious that i needed to have a titanium knee replacement , which involved major surgery and a lengthy recovery period			1
' luckily , @entity0 's knee surgery at the @entity117 in 2011 was a success			2
after following the advice of her doctor and physiotherapist to swear off heels altogether , to avoid damaging her new , artificial knee , she is fitter than ever			1
she has lost 1½ st , is playing badminton several times a week and goes to the gym regularly			0
' i miss my heels and envy friends who can still wear them , ' she says			2
the average woman spends £ 136.52 on five new pairs of shoes a year the knee op was n't her only surgery			1
' i had to have a bunion surgically removed from my left foot last year , too , which was caused - or certainly worsened - by years of wearing tight , pointy stilettos			1
' i probably would have paid more attention to the fit of my shoes , rather than how fashionable they looked , if i 'd known they would force me to go under the knife twice			0
' @entity143 is the obvious reason why @entity0 is far from the only woman willing to suffer for fashion - there 's no question that legs look longer and more elegant in beautiful heels			2
in a recent survey of 1,200 women , 93 per cent said they felt sexier and more feminine when they wore heels , 88 per cent said they considered themselves more stylish and 77 per cent said their heels made them feel slimmer			0
with statistics like those , it 's no surprise that many women seem to take a dangerously ' no pain , no gain ' approach to their footwear , however dire the warnings			0
retired teacher @entity167 , 61 , has also suffered life - changing knee problems from wearing heels since she was a teenager			1
' my husband and i go on a lot of cruises , and recently took up ballroom dancing , which call for lots of dressing up and wearing high - heels for hours on end , ' she says			1
but unbearable knee pain that began in 2010 , when she was 55 , threatened to curtail her leisure activities altogether			0
@entity167 has also suffered life - changing knee problems from wearing heels ' at first , i just put the pain down to ageing and tried to soldier on , but as time went on , over-the - counter painkillers stopped working and the niggling , arthritic pains were keeping me awake at night , ' she says			1
' six months after they started , i went to see my doctor and was given steroid injections in my knee			0
they really helped in the short term , but i still found i could n't wear heels when we went out or on holiday - it was just too painful			1
' i was still teaching young children at the time , but i struggled to kneel down beside them in the classroom			0
i could n't drive and as i stopped being so active , i started to pile on weight and suddenly felt old , despondent and frumpy			0
' @entity167 had to undergo arthroscopies - keyhole surgery to remove damaged cartilage - on both knees before a right knee replacement by orthopaedic surgeon @entity205 at @entity206 improved things			1
' within six weeks of having my knee replaced i was driving again and went on holiday to @entity210			0
' within nine weeks , i could ride my bike and go back to ballroom dancing			0
i still wear heels occasionally - mainly when i 'm dancing - but the heels are lower than they used to be			0
' of course , arthritis and bunions are not the only problems that can be caused by high heels - squeezing feet into too - tight points can lead to misshapen hammer toes , and regular wearers of 3 in heels may suffer from tendonitis , where the @entity224 shrinks and tightens painfully			1
@entity60 says wearing high heels regularly can also be at the root of a raft of excruciatingly painful back , hip and even neck problems			1
' standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual , healthy alignment , which means muscles and joints throughout the body have to compensate to maintain its centre of gravity and keep the body upright , ' he says			0
despite being otherwise fit and healthy , former @entity243 television sports presenter @entity242 , 60 , blames her fondness for heels for the excruciatingly painful lower back problems that plagued her 40s and 50s			2
at times , the pain was so bad she was unable to drive and was forced to use a stick			0
' high heels have always been considered part of a female tv presenter 's uniform , ' she says			1
' not that i complained - high shoes have always be my preferred choice of footwear when i 've got to look smart			0
the shame is that i ca n't really wear them any more			0
' though her back problems had been triggered by squash and tennis injuries in her 30s , @entity242 was advised by an orthopaedic consultant and osteopath that her penchant for heels was exacerbating her problems			2
' i was told to stick to flats or shoes with a very low heel and to spend as much time barefoot as possible to help correct my posture , which had been thrown out of alignment by wearing heels day in and day out , ' she says			1
standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual , healthy alignment ' i was also given exercises to follow to strengthen my abdominals and back muscles , and help correct the poor postural habits i had developed , which were putting strain on my lower back			0
' for the past 15 years , i 've had to stick to flat footwear and keep up the exercises to keep my back pain at bay			0
' i still take heels with me to slip on for tv appearances , but the twinges in my back start if i have to stand in them for more than an hour			0
' for high - heel lovers not yet suffering painful problems , podiatrist @entity294 advises picking shoes carefully			1
' if you are after height , wear a comfy platform or a shoe with a heavy block heel - which will give you support - rather than a flimsy stiletto with a thin sole , ' he says			0
and @entity60 says : ' take a break			0
if you 're wearing a pair of heels over 2 in high , limit the time spent wearing them to two hours maximum			1
' after two hours , sit down , take the heels off and walk around barefoot if possible for 30 minutes to allow time for your feet and knees to recover			0
' interestingly , consultant knee surgeon @entity317 , at the @entity315 in @entity316 , has even more hope for those who ca n't bear to part with their favourite footwear - he is not convinced the link between high heels and arthritis in the knees has been proved			1
' there 's no doubt that high heels change the forces on the knee joint , but none of the long - term studies i 've seen suggest they go on to cause serious knee problems , ' he says			1
' yes , there is a definite link to issues such as @entity0 's bunions and @entity242 's postural problems			0
' but when it comes to knees , keeping your weight down and exercising regularly to keep the supportive muscles around the knees fit and strong are , in my opinion , by far the most important steps you can take to prevent or slow down arthritis in the knees			0
