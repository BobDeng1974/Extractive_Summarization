the third , a goldbroker 's called @entity76 and @entity77 , told customers it was using their money to buy precious metals which were stored at its secure headquarter			1
in fact this money was being used for nothing more than to prop up the other two companies , the court was told			2

@entity49 , 75 ( left ) , the former mayor of @entity51 , was a director of the companies at the heart of the alleged fraud , while @entity185 , 46 ( right ) , ran a firm involved in buying and selling gold ' they could only keep going by having a larger and larger turnover , by offering more attractive exchange rates			1
' the reality was the companies were going into administration			2
to hide that , false accounts had to be provided			0

one victim , a former @entity23 , handed £ 210,000 to the company to buy euros which would be used to purchase a home in @entity111 for his retirement			2
in fact he never saw a penny back , and is now homeless and living via the charity of others , the court was told			0
@entity76 and @entity77 customers were told they were investing in gold bars , some as small as 20g , which were being held by the company at its secure headquarters			0
in fact , nothing was being bought with their money , and the cash was instead used to prop up the other failing business , the jury heard			1

according to prosecutors , only half of this ever materialised , the other 11kg was never seen again			0
