@entity0 has defended its decision to only stock larger sizes of its new @entity4 collection online , not in stores , a week after an angry consumer backlash erupted			1
' the last time we did this , it did n't work , ' said @entity0 spokesperson @entity11 told @entity12 29 , referring to poor sales of the plus sizes it tested with its @entity17 collaboration in 2011 , which was also offered exclusively online			1
last week , one @entity19 user , grownandcurvywoman , echoed the sentiments of many plus - size consumers when she tweeted : ' it 's like @entity0 is dating a fat girl but wo n't take her out in public			1
. that 's how i feel right now			0
' he added : ' we need to take a measured approach in terms of responding to the guests			0
' they say this is something they want to purchase ; so we 're hearing the feedback , we 're seeing the feedback , and what i think is really important , we are responding to the feedback			0
' @entity0 had previously described its decision to include larger sizes in the collection as ' democratic '			1
outrage : after being applauded for its decision to include plus sizes in the collaboration , @entity0 later revealed the larger options would only be available online grown and curvy : many plus - size fashion fans have hit back at the store 's decision , accusing it of discrimination against certain groups of customers ' they 're really saying we only want 40 [ per cent ] of customers to be seen in store , ' @entity63 added			1
the disappointing revelation only came to light after a customer queried a @entity0 spokesperson on its plans for plus size stock of the collection via its @entity19 account			1
' the question is , is [ plus ] size going to be sold in every store carrying the line or select store [ s ] of the standard online online , ' @entity81 tweeted , to which a @entity0 representative replied : ' ... the plus sized collection will be available online only			2
' just hours earlier , @entity0 's senior vice president of apparel and accessories @entity85 released a statement about the store 's plans to include a selection of larger sizes in the limited edition collaboration , something which has happened only rarely in the past			1
' it ’s really important for us that we can provide stylish apparel for everybody , and we felt like this collection was the right time to do it , ' she told @entity103			0
' they only want 40 per cent of customers in store ' : the plus - size community has been left feeling angry and frustrated at the news ongoing issue : it is not the first time that @entity0 has been accused of disrespecting plus - size men and women disappointment : some women have stated that they are sad to be missing out on the chance to actually browse the clothing in - store ' this project is so democratic			1
when we do these collaborations , there ’s a certain group of people that always really respond to them			0
' but this , anybody can wear this			0
there ’s just such a range that anyone can find something that they love			0
' the statement was initially praised by the plus - size community - many of whom applauded what they believed to be @entity0 's attempt to change the way it views its larger customers			2
' this is a victory for plus - size women ... ' @entity143 's @entity142 wrote online			2
' it seems @entity0 is willing to try this and see if plus sizes will sell			2
and we think @entity4 is perfect			0
' it ’s a well - known loved brand that ’s chic , stylish and fun and known as the mother of @entity30 resort wear			2
' @entity152 and bubbly : the bold collection is full of unique prints and patterns the best is yet to come : the collaboration will launch in - stores and online in april however , following the recent clarification about @entity0 's plans to only stock the larger sizes online , many are now accusing the retailer of being hypocritical			1
' i 'm excited about the offering but i 'm really sad that we wo n't be getting the shopping experience , ' @entity165 said on @entity19 , before adding : ' i feel like we got served steak on a garbage can lid ... like my @entity174 used to say ... ' this is not the first time that @entity0 has faced criticism from its plus size customers ; in august , fashion blogger @entity179 called for a nationwide boycott of the store , after it was revealed that the retailer would not offer any plus sizes as part of its recent @entity186 collaboration			1
' all i want is the clothing you offer all your other regular sized customers , but you always leave me out , ' she wrote on her blog @entity191			0
' with that being said , i have to end this relationship			0
it ’s you , not me and for my own well - being and my self dignity i have to sever ties between us			0

last week , @entity0 *announced* via its @entity19 account that sizes larger than @entity30 18 for its new @entity4 collection will only be available online
the news caused outrage among customers - particularly as the retailer previously stated this collaboration can be worn by ' everybody '
a spokesperson for @entity0 now says its decision to only stock plus sizes online allows it to ' try different things ' and ' be flexible '
when the retail giant *trialed* larger sizes - also exclusively online - for a previous collection in 2011 , sales were poor
