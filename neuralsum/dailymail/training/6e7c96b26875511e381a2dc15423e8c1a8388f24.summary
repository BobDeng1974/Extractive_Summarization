by @entity0 you may have created a battery using a potato or a lemon in a physics class at school			1
but one artist has taken the humble experiment a step further by using an array of fruit from limes to apples in order to make self - powered lights that light up his photographs			1
@entity18 uses nails hidden inside the fruit which are connected with copper to make batteries , inspired by the classic potato classroom experiment			1
almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell			0
the fruit / vegetable battery is a simple type of electrical battery that illustrates their main components			2
they are used in schools to illustrate the type of chemical reaction - oxidation - reduction - that occurs in batteries			2
a piece of zinc ( such as a galvanised nail ) and a piece of copper ( wire or a penny ) are used as electrodes , while the juice inside is the electrolyte			0
several lemons or potatoes can be wired together to form a more powerful battery that will power a light , buzzer or digital clock			0
fruit batteries are similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by @entity75 , who used brine ( salt water ) instead of lemon juice			2
the artist , from @entity80 , @entity81 , transforms the fruit into electrochemical cells , which he arranges artistically before taking long - exposure photographs of his work in a bid to highlight the potential of sustainable energy			1
the fruit itself provides enough light to illuminate the photographs , which are all taken in the dark			0
he writes on his website : ‘ to understand the world and to profit from it one must interact with it , one must experiment			0
‘ my practice as an artist combines a scientific curiosity with a constructive approach to making pictures			0
‘ i utilise everyday objects and fundamental forces to illustrate experiences of wonder			0
mr @entity18 explained that his @entity111 project ‘ expands upon a classic grade school science project , the potato battery			1
juice to make juice : @entity18 uses nails hidden inside the fruit , such as limes ( pictured ) which are connected with copper to make batteries , inspired by the potato classroom experiment beacon of hope : the artist transforms the fruit into electrochemical cells , which he arranges artistically before taking long - exposure photographs of his work in a bid to highlight the potential of sustainable energy			1
a quirky apple lampshade is pictured left and a citrus light , right illuminating : the fruit itself provides enough light to illuminate the photographs , which are all taken in the dark			0
at first glance , this arrangement looks a little like the solar system ‘ by inserting a galvanised nail into one side of a potato and a copper wire in the other side a small electrical current is generated			0
the utter simplicity of this electrical phenomenon is endlessly fascinating for me			0
’ he believes that the fact that so many people have conducted the experiment when they were young speaks to a common curiosity that humans have in understanding how the world works ‘ as well as a global concern for the future of @entity158 ’s energy sources			2
mr @entity18 said : ' my practice as an artist combines a scientific curiosity with a constructive approach to making pictures			2
' here , jars and bottles of liquid are used as batteries to produce light shining example : a small electrical current is generated by inserting a galvanized nail into one side of the fruit and a copper wire in the other side			1
these apples have been connected to make a circuit capable of powering a small light ( pictured ) ‘ my hope is that these photographs function as micro utopias by suggesting and illustrating the endless possibilities of alternative and sustainable energy production , ’ he said			1
‘ the cycle that begins with the light of our closest star implanting organic materials with nutrients and energy , is re-routed in these images , back to @entity111 , illuminating @entity158 once again			0
’ tree of knowledge : mr @entity18 explained that his @entity111 project ' expands upon a classic grade school science project , the potato battery '			1
here , the principles of the experiment - and plenty of apples - are used to illuminate the tree with a make - shift chandelier ' my hope is that these photographs function as micro utopias by suggesting and illustrating the endless possibilities of alternative and sustainable energy production , ' he said			1

an artist in @entity80 , @entity81 was inspired to create the fruit - powered lights by the popular potato battery classroom experiment
@entity18 uses nails hidden inside the fruit which are connected with copper as well as a light bulb to make batteries and the fruit glow
he arranges the electrochemical cells before photographing them
his art aims to show people the potential of simple sustainable energy
