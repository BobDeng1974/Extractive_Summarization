a portrait of @entity1 , the @entity1 during the 72 - year reign of @entity1 - the longest of any major @entity5 monarch - @entity3 became the universal language of the @entity5 elite			1
so it is not exactly surprising that @entity3 critics have reacted angrily to the news he is to become the protagonist in a new ' dumbed down ' television show - produced in @entity14			1
critics have labelled it a ' crime ' to have the great monarch speak in @entity14 - particularly as the ten - part series is being made by @entity3 station @entity19			1
the show , called @entity22 , has also been written by @entity27 @entity26 's nephew @entity28 and @entity30 creator @entity29 - and stars @entity24 actors			1
@entity32 , best known for his role as @entity34 in the 2012 film adaptation of @entity36 , will play the role of the @entity1			2
it may be small comfort to critics that @entity32 is at least fluent in @entity3 , as is @entity41 , another @entity24 - born actor who will play a courtesan called @entity43			1
seeing 24 - year - old @entity32 speak in @entity14 could be a strange experience for @entity3 viewers , as he fought @entity47 's @entity14 disciples during the @entity48			1
the series will cost a huge £ 21million - which works out as twice as much per episode as @entity51			0
it will follow a young @entity1 from 1660 , 17 years into his reign when he is 22 , on his journey to become the most powerful monarch in @entity5 , from his battles with the fronde through his development into the @entity1			2
a synopsis for the show on spoilertv reads : ' born strategist , mischievous manipulator , @entity64 will use every resource at his disposal to keep the @entity67 on a short leach , while feeling bitter resentment in his private life , even paranoia			0
the man is also capable of romantic passion			0
but how to live them when you 're the greatest king in the world ? the show will follow a young @entity1 from 1660 , 17 years into his reign when he is 22 , on his journey to become the most powerful monarch in @entity5 the series will cost a huge £ 21million - which works out as twice as much per episode as @entity51 the show , called @entity22 , has been written by @entity27 @entity26 's nephew @entity28 and @entity30 creator @entity29 - and stars @entity24 actors ' the first season will see the young @entity1 evolve to become the @entity1 , the @entity85			1
characters both real or fictional , from courtesans to humble paysans , will guide us through a world of betrayals and secrecy , political manoeuvres and war declarations , revealing @entity22 in all of its glory and brutality			0
a golden cage where arrivists , ready to do anything to get in , will never be able to get out			0
' @entity101 played @entity1 in the 1998 film @entity103 , but @entity22 is being produced by a @entity3 station , @entity19 @entity19 will premiere the show next year , and it will not be the first time they have produced television in @entity14 - it was also behind @entity110			1
nor is it the first time @entity1 will have spoken @entity14 on screen			0
he was played by @entity101 in 1998 film @entity103			0
but the fact that this series has been produced by a @entity3 station and is being broadcast in @entity3 makes it a little harder for critics to stomach			2
' it is very worrying and totally implausible that a series about @entity1 should be made in @entity14 , ' @entity118 of the @entity119 told @entity122			2
' we have nothing against @entity14 , but we do n't want @entity3 to become a second language in @entity3			2
' the decision to produce in @entity14 has been made because it will make the show easier to sell outside of @entity3			1
director of fiction at @entity19 , @entity130 , called it a ' pragmatic choice to enable the series to be exported '			0
in @entity3 itself , viewers will be able to choose to watch the show with subtitles or dubbed in @entity3			0
perspective view of the @entity138 from the @entity139 at the end of the reign of @entity1			0

@entity3 became language of @entity5 elite during @entity1 's 72 - year reign
critics have called it a ' crime ' that he will be speaking @entity14 in new show
@entity22 , made by @entity19 , will be a ten - part series *released* next year
written by @entity26 's nephew @entity28 and @entity30 creator
starts @entity14 actor @entity32 , 24 , in role of the @entity1
