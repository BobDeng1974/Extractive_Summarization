riots broke out across @entity1 yesterday in protest against president @entity4 ’s ‘ seizure ’ of sweeping new powers			1
a day after mr @entity4 declared that the president ’s decisions could not be revoked , even by the judiciary , tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists converged on @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
mr @entity4 's opponents threw molotov cocktails at a police van and set fire to @entity17 offices in the @entity19 cities of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity23 also erupted between rival factions across the country			0
anger : fires were started at @entity17 offices across @entity1 including in the port city of @entity30 , pictured a young man throws stones during a clash in the @entity35 city of @entity30 computers and desks are among the being thrown out of windows at the offices of the @entity40 a man throws a stone at a rival rally the day after @entity4 assumed the ' powers of a @entity45 ' a young boy appears to be in agony as he is beaten around the head by much older men flames : protesters threw a molotov cocktail at a police van during clashes at @entity10 in @entity11 this evening triggered by the president 's new powers critics of @entity4 accused him of seizing dictatorial powers with the decrees that make him immune to judicial oversight and give him authority to take any steps against ' threats to the revolution ' - rules that rights groups say are like ' emergency laws			1
' the president spoke before a crowd of his supporters massed in front of his palace and said his edits were necessary to stop a ' minority ' that was trying to block the goals of the revolution			1
' there are weevils eating away at the nation of @entity1 , ' he said , pointing to old regime loyalists he accused of using money to fuel instability and to members of the judiciary who work under the ' umbrella ' of the courts to ' harm the country '			0
but the move has divided the country and people for and against the reforms made by the @entity94 president have gathered in places such as @entity10 in @entity11 and near the presidential palace			2
in the @entity35 city of @entity30 , @entity98 crowds attacked @entity17 backers coming out of a mosque , raining stones and firecrackers on them			1
the @entity104 held up prayer rugs to protect themselves and the two sides pelted each other with stones and chunks of marble , leaving at least 15 injured			0
the protesters then stormed a nearby @entity17 office			2
in the capital @entity11 , security forces pumped volleys of tear gas at thousands of pro-democracy protesters clashing with riot police on streets several blocks from @entity10			0
tens of thousands of activists massed in @entity10 itself , angered at the decisions by @entity4			2
many of them represent @entity1 's upper - class , liberal elite , which have largely stayed out of protests in past months but were prominent in the streets during the @entity131 uprising that began jan. 25 , 2011			0
protesters chanted , " leave , leave " and " @entity4 is @entity133 ... revolution everywhere			1
' ' we are in a state of revolution			0
he is crazy of he thinks he can go back to one - man rule , " one protester at @entity10 , @entity140 , said of @entity4			2
' this decision shows how insecure and weak he is because he knows there is no consensus			0
' ' if the @entity17 's slogan is " @entity145 is the solution " ours is " submission is not the solution " , ' said @entity149 , a mass communications professor at the @entity150			1
' and this is @entity145 because @entity152 does not call for submission to another man 's will			0
' protest : @entity1 opponents of president @entity4 break into the office of the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , the political arm of the @entity17 , in the city unrest : president @entity4 's policies are driving a wedge between religious and democracy groups in @entity1 unrest : a man shelters as missiles are thrown by rival groups during the disturbances in @entity30 president @entity4 was only elected to the top job a matter of months ago riding high on @entity171 and international praise for mediating a @entity173 cease - fire , the president put himself above oversight and gave protection to the @entity94 - led assembly - writing a new constitution from a looming threat of dissolution by court order			1
but the move is likely to fuel growing public anger that he and the @entity17 are seizing too much power			2
in what was interpreted by rights activists as a de facto declaration of emergency law , one of mr @entity4 's decrees gave him the power to take ' due measures and steps ' to deal with any ' threat ' to the revolution , national unity and safety or anything that obstructs the work of state institutions			1
he framed his decisions as necessary to protect the revolution that toppled @entity133 nearly two years ago and to cement the nation 's transition to democratic rule			2
many activists , including opponents of the @entity17 , criticise the judiciary as packed with judges and prosecutors sympathetic to mr @entity133			2
@entity17 supporters accuse the courts of trying to block their agenda			2
' he had to act to save the country and protect the course of the revolution , ' said one of mr @entity4 's aides , @entity218 , speaking on @entity219			1
in a nod to revolutionary sentiment , mr @entity4 also ordered the retrial of mr @entity133 and top aides on charges of killing protesters during the uprising			2
he also created a new ' protection of the revolution ' judicial body to swiftly carry out the prosecutions			2
but he did not order retrials for lower - level police acquitted of such killings , another widespread popular demand that would disillusion the security forces if carried out			0
@entity237 politicians immediately criticised the decrees as dictatorial and destined to divide a nation already reeling from months of turmoil following mr @entity133 's ousting			0
some claim they exceeded the powers once enjoyed by the former president			0
violence : @entity1 supporters and opponents of president @entity4 clashed in @entity30 opposition : many @entity98 campaigners believe the president is similar to former president @entity133 violence : an injured protester is taken to a field hospital in @entity10 , @entity11 , during today 's protests mock - up : a poster depicts @entity4 as a @entity45 during a rally in @entity258 , @entity11 support : pro-mursi protesters chant slogans as they praise a new decree issued yesterday power : mr @entity4 decreed that he was above the judiciary meaning that courts will not be able to challenge his decisions defences : security forces sit at a blockade in a street leading to the @entity1 parliament and @entity10 ' @entity4 today usurped all state powers & appointed himself @entity1 's new pharaoh , ' pro-reform leader @entity274 wrote on @entity275			1
' a major blow to the revolution that could have dire consequences			1
' mr @entity274 later addressed a news conference flanked by other prominent politicians from outside the @entity17 - including two presidential candidates who ran against mr @entity282 and @entity283			1
security and military forces were today deployed outside the key state institutions they pledged to cooperate to force the president to rescind his assumption of greater powers			0
they called for mass protests today to demand the dissolution of the declarations			0
the prospect of large rival protests involving mr @entity4 's opponents and supporters in @entity11 today raises the likelihood of clashes			1
thousands from the rival camps were already out on the streets of @entity11 late yesterday in an increasingly charged atmosphere			0
a crowd of @entity17 supporters massed outside the @entity307 building and offices of the prosecutor general - whom mr @entity4 removed in thursday 's edict			1
in @entity10 , hundreds of demonstrators held a fourth straight day of protests against @entity4 and the @entity17			1
' @entity17 is banned from entry , ' declared a large banner at the protest			2
the @entity1 leader decreed that all decisions he has made since taking office in june and until a new constitution is adopted and a new parliament is elected can not be appealed in court or by any other authority			0
parliamentary elections are not likely before next spring			0
the decree also barred the courts from dissolving the controversy - plagued assembly writing the new constitution			0
several courts have been looking into lawsuits demanding the panel be disbanded			0
critics fear mr @entity4 and the @entity17 are trying to marginalise women and minority @entity334 , infringe on personal liberties and even give @entity17 clerics a say in lawmaking			1
@entity237 and @entity341 members withdrew from the assembly during the past week to protest what they say is the hijacking of the process by mr @entity4 's allies			2
the president has extended by two months , until february , the deadline for the assembly to produce a draft , apparently to give members more time to iron out their differences			0
he also barred any court from dissolving the @entity94 - led upper house of parliament , a largely toothless body that has also faced court cases			0
criticism : former @entity1 presidential candidate , @entity283 , left , and @entity274 ( right ) , have criticised mr @entity4 's decrees fears : an @entity1 protester chants slogans and holds a cross and a quran in @entity10			1
many @entity1 christians fear being marginalised by the @entity17 show of force : protests were taking place today across @entity11 after noon prayers had finished the president made most of the changes on thursday in a declaration amending an interim constitution that has been in effect since shortly after mr @entity133 's fall			1
the moves come as mr @entity4 basks in lavish praise from @entity171 president @entity379 and secretary of state @entity380 for mediating an end to eight days of fighting between @entity383 and @entity173 's @entity385 rulers			1
@entity386 was in @entity11 on wednesday , when she held extensive talks with mr @entity4			0
mr @entity4 not only holds executive power , he also has legislative authority after a previous court ruling just before he took office on june 30 dissolved the powerful lower house of parliament , which was led by the @entity17			1
thursday 's decisions were read on state television by his spokesman , @entity397			0
in a throwback to the days of the authoritarian president @entity133 and his predecessors @entity400 and @entity402 , the television followed up with a slew of nationalist songs .			0
