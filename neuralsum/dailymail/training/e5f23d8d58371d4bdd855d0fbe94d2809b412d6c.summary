by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 2 may 2013 this week tv presenter @entity2 was the latest to reveal he 's a fan of the weight loss plan of the moment - the @entity5			1
the eating plan , and others like it such as the 5:2 diet , are taking @entity9 by storm and involve intermittent fasting			1
mr @entity2 admitted he has lost 9lb since sticking to it			0
followers must only consume 500 calories ( 600 for men ) on two fasting days a week and can then eat what they want on the other five days			1
slim pickings : experts have warned that fasting can lead to people missing out on vital nutrients but the @entity22 have now warned that such denial of food can lead to people missing out on vital vitamins and minerals			1
they told the @entity29 that people already deficient in iron or calcium could cause their health to deteriorate further by fasting			1
they also warned that people should n't start the diet without first getting medical advice on whether it is safe for them to do so			1
bestseller : the @entity5 promises weightloss and additional health benefits such as lower cholesterol finding a balance : over-indulging on non-fasting days can negate the benefits ' my advice would be do n't do this if you 're pregnant , diabetic or on medication , and if you are planning to do it take advice from a dietitian to make sure you do n't miss out on vital nutrients , ' @entity22 spokeswoman @entity45 told the newspaper			1
the craze for @entity56 and the @entity5 follows on from the recent popularity of the diets such as @entity59 and @entity60			0
ms @entity45 added that people should wait until long - term research has been carried out on fasting diets before jumping on the latest bandwagon			1

she told the @entity101 people should not think of their non-fasting days as licence to eat unhealthy			0
advocates : @entity74 and dr @entity71 's @entity5 has taken the country by storm - but experts say the long - term benefits need to be ascertained ' the point is your body becomes calorie deficient on the fasting days			1
