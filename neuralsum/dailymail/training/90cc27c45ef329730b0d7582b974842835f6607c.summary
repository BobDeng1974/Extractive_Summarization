inspired by images from science fiction films , @entity12 photographer @entity11 has designed a range of futuristic miniature droids called @entity15			1
from insects to drones , his electronic figures are all compiled from a collection of broken , everyday items			0
inspired by images from science fiction films , @entity12 photographer @entity11 has designed a range of robotic sculptures called @entity15			1
each of his electronic figures is made up of old household , everyday electrical items			1
this humanoid features a motor for a head , and parts of a hard drive for arms many of @entity11 's designs were based on the work of @entity37 artist and set designer @entity38			1
@entity38 was part of the special effects team that won an award for the design of the 1979 science fiction film @entity44			1
he is famous for artwork that represents the human body and machines in a ' cold interconnected relatonship '			0
@entity38 calls this relationship ' biomechanical '			2
these include parts taken from broken @entity52 , dvd drives , hard drives , power supplies and plugs and vacuum tubes			1
each @entity58 is then fitted together using copper , steel and aluminum wires			0
@entity11 also uses everyday tools , such as pliers and screwdrivers , to build his creatures			2
the 38 - year - old graphic designer and photographer from @entity68 , @entity12 said his designs developed out of a fascination for electronics			0
' i take junk that would otherwise go into a landfill and turn it into art , ' explained @entity11			0
â € ˜ looking at [ the electronic ] parts , i could see that some could possibly be an arm , leg or head for a robot			0
as well as humanoids , photographer @entity11 , 38 , also makes robotic sculptures designed to look like insects , like the one pictured			1
he said the intricate parts of many electronic items resemble the delicate arms and legs of spiders and other creatures this robotic sculpture was designed to look like a drone			1
it 's base is made from a disc drive , while the arms are attached with fuses and copper wire @entity11 said his designs developed out of a fascination for electronics			2
each sculpture takes up to six hours to complete , and the designer said the most time - consuming job is finding the right part for each leg , head or body from this tool kit , pictured ' after making my first robot , i was pleased with the way it turned out , so i continued making more			1
' @entity11 's @entity15 range from between four and six inches in size , and because of this minature design , @entity11 admitted the construction can be fiddly and time - consuming			0
complicated humanoids , or more detailed creatures , can take up to six hours to complete , for example			2
yet the most time - consuming job is finding the right part for each leg , head or body			0
the wings of the robotic insect , left , were made from wire bent into shape			0
the body is made using part of a laser drive , taken from a broken dvd or hard drive			2
@entity11 gets other parts from broken @entity52 , power supplies and plugs , and vacuum tubes			1
the simple octopus design , right , is made from a light casing and motor ' i reject parts if i do n't like their shape , colour , material or how it would look on the robot			0
' @entity147 is very important to me ; every part needs to be just the right shape and size			0
' some people do n't understand what they 're looking at while others wonder about its functionality , whether it does anything			0
' techies particularly enjoy this , i ask them to see how many parts they recognise and figure out where the parts came from			0
' each @entity58 , including this sculpture that looks like an anglerfish , is between four and six inches in size , and because of this miniature design , @entity11 said the construction can be fiddly and time - consuming @entity11 said that proportion is key when designing @entity15 , especially the more complex humanoid designs pictured			1
he added that he will regularly reject parts if they 're the wrong shape , colour or size many of @entity11 's designs , including these fly - shaped sculptures pictured , were based on the work of @entity37 artist and set designer @entity38			1
