@entity1 's most famous fan has admitted that the blue half of @entity3 may never be as big a club as their city rivals			2
former @entity7 frontman @entity6 also said that @entity1 should n't be expanding their stadium , as they ca n't even fill its current capacity			1
speaking before sunday 's @entity3 derby , @entity6 told @entity11 that @entity1 had changed for the better , but will never be able to rival @entity12 as a brand			1
' i do n't think @entity1 can ever get that			0
' ' i 'm not sure it 's a good idea to boost that stadium to @entity32 , really , if we were going to get that there 'd be 10,000 locked out the stadium every week			0
when you look at the games and go to the games , there are empty seats			0
' however , the @entity1 fan also hit out at @entity12 supporters over their perceived hypocrisy about spending power			1
@entity6 hit out at the hypocrisy of @entity12 spending big on the likes of @entity47 and @entity48 ' it 's the hypocrisy i hate , ' continued @entity6			1
' they 've been slagging @entity53 off for years and as soon as the big bad wolf 's out the door , it 's raining tenners ! ' @entity1 have been successful in the fixture in recent times , winning five of the last six @entity61 meetings			0
and with his team finishing a massive 22 points clear of @entity12 last season , it is perhaps justified that @entity6 said he would only want @entity67 at his club out of @entity70 's squad			2
the former @entity7 frontman admitted that his beloved @entity1 would never be as big a brand as @entity12 @entity6 did admit that he would take @entity67 ( left ) for @entity1 if he could , but as a no 2 to @entity73 ( right ) ' i 'd take the goalie , straight away , ' @entity6 conceded , before joking : ' he could carry @entity73 [ @entity73 's ] kit around , he 's a good no 2			1
@entity6 also could n't resist goading @entity11 about @entity1 's first @entity61 win over their rivals , when the @entity12 defender was at fault for a @entity82 goal			1
the musician described it as one of his favourite derby memories , before adding that ' it was a special moment '			0
' we all knew you were getting the hair - dryer the moment you got in that dressing room			0
' @entity82 's goal against @entity12 in 2002 was one of @entity6 's favourite derby moments			2
