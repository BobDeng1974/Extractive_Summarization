by @entity0 it was almost a case of deja vu			1
an overweight , badly dressed contestant lumbers awkwardly on to the @entity6 ’s @entity5 stage , prompting the judges to roll their eyes at the inevitable car - crash of a performance to follow			1
only to be wowed by the powerful , pitch - perfect voice of the unlikely star			1
but although producers might hope @entity15 becomes a global phenomenon in the mould of @entity18 , the painfully shy teenager was keen to distance himself from any such comparisons			1
‘ what i do n’t want is to be roped into a category with other people , ’ he told @entity20 , before his performance aired on the first show of the new series last night			1
' if anything i was hoping that because i do n’t look like a typical person who ’d be in the limelight , it would help			1
i ’d like to show that a person is more than a body			1
’ it is a message the 17 - year - old @entity48 student from @entity49 , @entity50 , is keen to spread , as just three months before his audition , he suffered a nervous breakdown triggered by bullying over his weight			1
he said : ‘ back in october i had a nervous breakdown			1
at that point i left the school i was at ; me and school just do n’t get on			2
’ low confidence : @entity59 calms her friend 's nerves before his audition			1
he has been bullied at school about his weight hitting all the right notes : @entity35 and @entity59 sing during the latest @entity66 auditions for @entity31 , safely making it through to the next round of the talent show praise : @entity35 and @entity59 receive a standing ovation from the audience and judges after a stunning performance of @entity75 and @entity76 ¿ s hit the prayer the revelation could raise questions about the @entity81 series , which has previously drawn criticism for failing to look after vulnerable acts , such as ms @entity18 who was admitted to the @entity85 after suffering a breakdown when she came second in the series final three years ago			1
but for the moment , @entity35 says : ‘ @entity6 ’s @entity5 has been a fun experience to do and it ’s been nice to be around all these people			2
‘ but i ’ve also been seeing a psychiatrist and so i ’m just on a really good road to somewhere			2
@entity6 ’s @entity5 have been very helpful			2
’ show sources said @entity35 passed all medical and psychological tests before appearing			2
while on the programme , @entity35 spoke of his difficulties with bullies , saying : ‘ i ’ve always had problems with my size ever since i can remember			2
thrilled : music mogul @entity101 told the teenage hopeful he was a ' future star ' with ' an outstandingly good voice ' @entity104 join in the fun and build up @entity35 as he arrives back stage after his impressive rendition of the difficult song ' when i was in primary school , i had the mick taken out of me and it kind of damaged my confidence quite a bit and when people would say something to me it would take a little piece out of me			0
’ but his confidence would surely have been boosted by the standing ovation he won for his show - stopping performance of @entity75 and @entity76 ’s hit @entity122 with schoolfriend @entity15			1
an estimated nine million viewers last night saw judge @entity125 describe it as ‘ world class ’ , and show guru @entity101 say : ‘ @entity35 , you are unbelievable			0
i mean seriously you have an outstandingly good voice			0
you are a future star			0
’ incredibly , @entity35 says he only discovered his singing potential four years ago , after his voice broke and he began taking singing lessons			0
he now attends the @entity134 one day a week			0
@entity35 is keen to avoid any comparisons to @entity18 , left in one of her first auditions when she took the world by storm and right , wearing a black frock after she became famous he is also full of praise for his singing partner , a 16 - year - old student at the @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity66			0
‘ @entity59 ’s been a really big help to me in terms of confidence and becoming a better performer , ’ he said			0
‘ i really do n’t think i ’d be on stage today if i did n’t have @entity59 by my side			0
’ discovering an unlikely new singing sensation will do nothing to harm @entity6 ’s @entity5 ’s chances in the ratings battle brewing with @entity157 ’s £ 22 million talent show , @entity158 , which also launched last night			0
in an apparent dig at @entity101 ’s approach , @entity158 presenter @entity159 said before the showdown : ‘ i think that as a country of television fans we ’re past that humiliation thing			0
’ his show ’s twist is that the judges – @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 – can not see the singer perform , so make their decision based on vocal ability alone			0
video : @entity35 told @entity179 he will be sticking with singing partner @entity59			0

@entity15 , 17 , had nervous breakdown three months before his audition *due* to bullying over his weight
