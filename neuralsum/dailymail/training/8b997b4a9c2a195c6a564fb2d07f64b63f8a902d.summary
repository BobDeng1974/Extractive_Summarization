still hung up on your ex ? you 're not alone			1
one in 12 of us never get over a past lover			1
and even those that can move on take an average of one month to recover for every year the relationship lasted			1
research also suggests that there are five factors that keep us stuck in the past			1
here sexpert @entity14 analyses the reasons why and offers advice on getting over somebody for good			1
solve it : write down - specifically - why the sex was so great with them			1
what you did , where you did it , why it felt sensational			1
it 'll lean heavier on one of two sides : the physical act was irrelevant and it was the person that turned you on or you did things with them you have n't done with others			1
how can you recreate it ? if it was the person , think about the circumstances of your life at the time			2
you ca n't compare dating @entity52 in humdrum , daily life to sex with @entity55 on holiday in @entity57			1
put @entity55 in your real life and sex would seem just as mundane			2
convinced it was a case of chemistry ? if it 's that important to you , wait until the sparks fly before settling down with someone else			2
but if you 're pining over what you did during sex , what 's stopping you doing it with your new partner ? being ' faithful ' to the sexual memory of the two of you , could be what 's keeping you stuck			2
according to @entity14 one in 12 of us never get over our past loves but there are five things we can do to try and move on reason two : the relationship drifted apart for no apparent reason if you 're not quite sure what caused the break - up , you ca n't help but keep dwelling on it			1
apart from not being able to learn from your mistakes , curiosity alone can drive you crazy			2
solve it : contact your ex. explain you 're having trouble moving on because you do n't have a clue why you split			1
ask them to tell you , straight out , without sparing your feelings , what it was that caused them to leave			2
take it on the chin , analyse it for a week , then drop it			2
if you ca n't contact them , ask a friend to be brutal : say you want their take on what happened without sparing your feelings			1
if they wo n't or ca n't help you , go to a therapist for help to make sense of it all			1
reason three : the break - up was your fault and could have been prevented the relationship was going wonderfully well and you had a one - night stand and got caught			2
or the timing was wrong for you			2
you ca n't stop thinking , if only i 'd done this or that			1
solve it : give it a second go , if you can			0
if you honestly think it could work if you changed your behaviour , call your ex and ask for another chance			0
explain the reason why it did n't work last time for you and your reasons for thinking it might now			1
if you cheated , chances are they 'll hang up in your ear			0
if it was something forgivable , they still might hang up in your ear ( their new lover is listening )			0
or they 'll agree to try again			0
whatever happens , you 'll get rid of that ' if only i tried harder ' feeling			0
both @entity150 and @entity151 ( left ) and @entity152 and @entity153 ( right ) are famous for long , drawn - out break ups reason four : reminders are everywhere you 're still living in the house you bought together			0
they 're still best friends with your best friends and you run into them constantly			0
even worse , you work together			0
solve it : take drastic measures			0
remove any reminders you can			0
if it seriously is ruining your life , it 's worth changing jobs , selling the house , even changing cities if you have to			0
drastic but necessary if it finally gets you over them and into a fresh , new life			0
reason five : you ca n't stop spying on them you know it 's ridiculous but you find yourself parked outside their flat , watching the window			1
you walk three miles at lunch time to watch them eat a sandwich in the park			0
every time you see them , the pain hits you again			0
solve it : keep a diary			0
write in it before you 're tempted to play @entity191 and - if you ca n't resist - when you get back again			1
one of three things will have happened : a ) you 've seen something that 's upset you ( that is , they 've found someone else ) ; b ) they caught you and you feel like a complete idiot ; or c ) nothing happened and you just feel empty and lonely			0
record all these feelings and when you 're tempted again , use the old smoker 's trick of putting it off for five minutes			0
spend that five minutes reading about how awful you felt after the last episode			0
