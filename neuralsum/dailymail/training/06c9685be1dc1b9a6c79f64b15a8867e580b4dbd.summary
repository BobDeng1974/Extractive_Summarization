an elderly couple returned from holiday to find a @entity3 burglar lying asleep in their bed after he broke in and spent two days treating their house as his own home			1
intruder @entity9 , 28 , enjoyed a bubble bath , cooked dinner and even tidied the home of @entity13 , 73 , and her partner @entity14 , 78 , in @entity15 , @entity16 , while they were away on five day @entity19 break			1
when they returned they found @entity9 , who had come to the @entity22 to find work , but had lost his lodgings due to language problems , sleeping in their bed and called the police			1
intruder : @entity9 , 28 , enjoyed a bubble bath , cooked dinner and even tidied the home of @entity13 , 73 , and her partner @entity14 , 78 , after breaking into their house in @entity15 , @entity16 , while they were away on five day @entity19 break property : @entity38 @entity37 was told that @entity9 thought the couple 's house was empty after seeing their overgrown ' wildlife garden ' the couple also found that a chicken fillet and pasta dinner had been prepared , dinner plates , post and newspapers were neatly stacked , the bath filled with water and even the intruder ’s socks and underwear hanging out to dry			1
just like the @entity55 fairytale mr @entity14 , exclaimed : ' someone ’s been sleeping in my bed - and he ’s still here ? ' before prodding their unwelcome house guest awake as mrs @entity60 called police			1
@entity9 later claimed he had been evicted from his regular lodgings , thought the couple ’s terraced house was ' derelict ' and forced open a rear window			1
nothing had been taken from their home			2
@entity9 , an upholsterer , pleaded guilty to burglary and theft at @entity72			1
the court was told that mrs @entity60 , a former tourist information officer and mr @entity14 , a retired civil servant had gone to @entity75 on a sightseeing trip			1
shock : mr @entity14 , pictured with the torch he used to wake the intruder , had exclaimed : ' someone ’s been sleeping in my bed - and he ’s still here ? ' before prodding their unwelcome house guest awake on their return at midnight on july 14 , they noticed no post behind the front door and the cordless telephone moved from its base on a table in the hallway			1
the couple went into the kitchen and found bags of pasta , processed cheese and the chicken fillets on the worktops			2
@entity99 , prosecuting , said : ' mr @entity14 went upstairs and his partner heard him say : “ what are you doing ? get out , get up			2
” ' she became immediately alarmed , ran upstairs and came across a bizarre situation where mr @entity14 was standing over the defendant , who was in bed			1
she described @entity9 as cowering under the bed sheets			1
' unwanted guest : mrs @entity60 ( pictured ) said that in terms of burglars , @entity9 was ' the most domesticated one i could ever ask for ' , and would even consider hiring him as a butler mr @entity99 said an open suitcase , containing @entity9 ’s belongings , was on the floor			2
the bath was half - full of hot water , with bubbles on top as if someone had just had a bath and there was a smell of perfume			2
the couple tried to communicate with @entity9 , who spoke little @entity126 , before calling 999 and mrs @entity60 locked the front door to prevent the intruder escaping			1
mr @entity99 said : ' in short , the defendant was making himself very much at home in their address			0
' it ’s quite an extraordinary state of affairs to come across			0
@entity135 ’s case is he just took pot luck , hoping that nobody would come back in the immediate future			0
he looked though some jewellery boxes , but he did not take anything			0
he was using the home as a cosy little hideaway			0
' the court was told that @entity9 had been asked to leave his rented home due to language problems and while searching for a new place to stay had spotted the overgrown ' wildlife garden ' at the front of the couple ’s home			1
' the defendant chose the house because he initially thought it was empty , ' said @entity154 , mitigating			2
return : the couple returned to their home ( left ) to find the bath ( right ) half - full of hot water , with bubbles on top as if someone had just had a bath , and there was a smell of perfume ' he said the garden was overgrown and he entered			1
at that point , he must have known somebody was residing there			0
he stayed there for two days , hoping the owners would n’t return , out of necessity , because he did n’t have anywhere else to stay			0
' @entity9 , now of @entity176 , was given a two year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 200 costs			1
judge mr @entity179 said : ' it would appear you entered this property not with any deep intent to be dishonest , but simply as somewhere to live and probably hide for some days			0
you were looking for somewhere to live in some sort of desperation			0
' it ’s right to say mrs @entity60 and mr @entity14 are at pains to ensure the court understands that they feel you left the house in a neat and tidy condition and from that i infer they feel some sympathy for you			1
' speaking after the hearing , mrs @entity60 said : ' it was all just so surreal and not something you expect to come home to but at least it was n’t like some of these awful things you see on @entity204			0
' the post and papers were neatly stacked in a pile and there were plates neatly stacked on the draining board and he had obviously made himself dinner			2
i was calling police when @entity14 said " @entity13 - there is someone sleeping in our bed and he ’s still here			1
" ' it was just like something out of @entity55			0
' we prodded him to wake him up but he just moaned and went deeper into the covers			0
as i walked back to go downstairs i noticed there was water in the bath and the towels had been left on the floor all wet			0
i also noticed he had done his washing			0
he had put the airer up and put his smalls and t - shirts out to dry			2
' when the man woke up was completely bedfuddled - and i do n’t think he knew what to think			0
a policewoman was there when they escorted him out			0
' she added : ' i do n’t know how he could think our house was derelict			2
@entity14 has volunteered as an estate manager and worked in woodland management for the last 30 years and he likes our garden to be like that			1
' in terms of burglars he was the most domesticated one i could ever ask for			0
fancy washing his dishes and airing his smalls			0
i would happily put up in the cellar as our butler - i think he would be very good at that			0
' i have been told he was living with other polish folk and got kicked out - i can only assume he was too tidy for them , insisting he would always do the washing up			2
