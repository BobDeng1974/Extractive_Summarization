by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 06:48 est , 23 january 2014 emerging from a lake , a giant amphibious drone gingerly picks its way over @entity7 ’s @entity6 military training ground			1
this huge drone is the latest in a menagerie of automated robots to be developed worldwide , adding to what some have described as the creation of ground - based robotic armies			1
its appearance comes as large organisations , such as @entity18 and @entity19 , invest in drone technology , with some experts claiming the it could lead to a full on robotics war by 2020			1
these latest images , however , provide a glimpse into @entity7 's future capabilities in ground - based drones			1
according to @entity7 president @entity39 , the country is aware of the potential of unmanned vehicles , but does not intend to use them the way other countries do			2
‘ today they [ drones ] are used more and more widely in the world			0
we wo n't do it the way other countries do , ’ said president @entity39 in november last year			0
‘ this is not a game , this is not a computer game , these are serious combat systems , both shock and reconnaissance versions , and it is absolutely clear that they have good prospects			0
according to @entity7 president @entity39 , the country is aware of the potential of unmanned vehicles , but does not intend to use them the way other countries do			2
pictured here is a drone at the @entity6 military training ground in @entity7 the country is reportedly developing a variety of ground - based drones including smaller six - wheeled models such as the one shown here last year , @entity18 's chief @entity73 warned drone technology proves a serious danger to global security			1
mr @entity73 said that the technology for armed unmanned planes will soon pass into the hands of terrorists posing huge security concerns across the globe			0
he also said that ever expanding drone technology is making smaller and cheaper models , including nano - drones , which could be used by nosy neighbors spying on each other in a dispute			2
' i 'm not going to pass judgement on whether armies should exist , but i would prefer to not spread and democratise the ability to fight war to every single human being , ' he said			0
in december , @entity18 acquired robotic firm @entity95			1
the firm , bought for an unspecified figure , is the eighth robotics company snapped up by @entity18 in recent years			2
the @entity7 government is also in talks to establish an organisation that will develop and produce unmanned aircraft systems , according to the @entity102			2
it ’s not just @entity7 who increased invested in drone technology			0
@entity95 , which made the @entity107 machine , was recently acquired by the internet giant @entity18			1
the firm , bought for an unspecified figure , is the eighth robotics company snapped up by @entity18 in recent years and is unlikely to be the last			0
three of @entity18 ’s recent acquisitions make robotic arms , used for lifting heavy weights and unloading trucks			1
another , @entity116 , makes androids that have eyelids , workable fingers and ears that move and flex , while another makes hi - tech cameras that were used to film recent @entity123 hit @entity124			0
so what is @entity18 , better known for running an online search engine , doing amassing a vast wealth of robotic experts and patents ? when asked whether the company is building an army of domestic servant robots , a press officer for @entity18 in the @entity134 laughed , before adding they did n’t know			1
the @entity7 government is also in talks to establish an organisation that will develop and produce unmanned aircraft systems , as well as ground - based drones pictured here it 's not just @entity7 who has increased invested in drone technology			1
@entity95 , which made the @entity107 machine , was recently acquired by the internet giant @entity18			1
the infographic shows recent corporate investments in robotic technology @entity18 is not the only @entity148 company working on projects that might seem more akin to a @entity123 blockbuster			2
@entity19 recently announced plans to begin offering some deliveries by airborne drones			0
called ‘ @entity155 ’ , the flying robots will take orders directly from the warehouse to homes or offices following gps satellites and could be ready in five years			0
‘ i know this looks like science fiction , but it ’s not , ’ said @entity19 chief executive @entity161			0
company sources also recently said the group was working on even more ambitious and futuristic projects – but refused to elaborate on what they might be			0
the appearance of this @entity7 drone comes as large organisation such as @entity18 and @entity19 invest in drone technology , with some experts claiming the technology could lead to a full on robotic war by 2020			1

ground - based robots were spotted at @entity7 's @entity6 training ground
among them was an amphibious model and a smaller six - wheeled robot
their appearance follows @entity18 's acquisition of @entity95 and several other robotic companies
