the warning at railway stations always like to remind us to ‘ @entity3 ’ when stepping on or getting off a train			1
but perhaps it should also add the words ‘ particularly if you ’re wearing high heels ’ , according to research			1
an analysis by @entity11 has shown that women in killer heels are particularly in danger of suffering an accident - sometimes fatal - when boarding or getting off a train			1
drinking alcohol beforehand , being in a hurry , carrying luggage or paying more attention to a smart - phone or tablet are the other main risk factors			0
figures show women with luggage and those who have been drinking should take the most care when boarding or getting off a train			1
file photo figures show that , in the last five years , 18 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 injured falling from a mainline station platform while boarding or getting off a train			1
@entity11 , together with the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , is launching a new campaign to improve safety at stations			1
the report says 9 per cent of all platform incidents involve ‘ intoxication ’ , noting : ‘ more men are involved in alcohol related incidents than women			1
’ but overall women account for 65per cent of accidents alighting or boarding trains			1
the report said : ‘ footwear could be one reason for this difference			0
it is also possible that females are more likely to report this type of incident			0
’ women aged 50 - 71 experience the highest proportion of accidents			1
one in seven platform accidents involve people struggling with luggage , carrying suitcases , pushchairs , bikes or other baggage			2
one in seven platform accidents involve people struggling with luggage , pushchairs , bikes or other baggage the report also says that getting off the train ‘ is more hazardous than boarding ’ , while summer sees the highest proportion of incident despite having lower passenger numbers			1
in the five years between 1 april 2009 and 31 march 2014 there were 6,969 reported incidents of slips trips and falls at the point where passengers alight or board trains			2
this has increased from 1259 in 2009/10 to 1490 in 2013/14 – an 18 per cent rise			2
@entity83 in @entity84 has had the highest number of platform incidents ( 40 ) followed by @entity87 ( 29 ) , @entity88 ( 28 ) , @entity89 ( 23 ) @entity90 ( 22 ) and @entity91 ( 22 )			0
@entity83 , pictured , in @entity84 has had the highest number of platform incidents after that comes @entity94 new street ( 21 ) , @entity95 ( 19 ) , @entity96 ( 18 ) and @entity97 ( 16 )			2
a public awareness campaign has been launched in stations across @entity100 called ‘ @entity101 ’			0
featuring various pairs of upended feet and legs , it uses cartoons and quirky verse to encourage people to be more considerate of their fellow passengers			2
one aimed at drinkers and showing a bottle says : ’ if your friends have had a little tipple or had a little fun , look after them like a good chum			0
’ another notes : ’ @entity118 and cases have minds of their own			0
oh how they love to speed off alone			0
’ a third aimed at smart - phone users notes : ‘ a clever clogs is never clever when glued to the phone			0
. so keep those eyes peeled for risks that are shown			0
’ the report notes : ‘ the gap between the train and the platform is designed to be practical			0
it must both be large enough to provide sufficient space for a variety of different train types to run safely and practicably without creating a physical obstruction but also be small enough to allow people to get on and off quickly and safely			1
‘ the gap can not be closed nor can it ever be exactly the same at all @entity100 ’s 2,500 stations , as they were built at different times by different historic railway companies			0

@entity11 analysis shows women in killer heels are most in danger
figures show 18 people have been killed in the last five years and nearly 7,000 injured while boarding or getting off a train
