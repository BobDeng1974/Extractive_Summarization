' i said to her , " @entity82 , you know i never told you that you could have the memorabilia			0
" ' her response was , " yes , but you never said you wanted it , either			0
" of course , this is untrue , since my wife and i requested that she return my memorabilia several years earlier			0
' last week , @entity2 's lawyers demanded that @entity10 scrap the scheduled june sale			2
in response , the auction house sued the athlete for the right to go ahead with the sale of the @entity97			2
mr @entity2 has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not his mother , but both he and his wife , @entity100 , had testified in writing that @entity21 took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block without their permission , and then refused to return the prized possessions			1

attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case may 20 in @entity74			0
the disagreement is a high - value , high - profile version of a question many families face : can @entity82 get rid of the stuff a grown child left at home ? in this case , the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of $ 1.5 million			0
among the first 100 or so items @entity21 intends to sell : the @entity47 star 's jerseys , practice gear and sweatsuits from @entity162 ; varsity letters ; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995 @entity167 basketball camp ; and a signed basketball from the 2000 @entity47 championship game			0

according to court filings , @entity21 struck a deal in january with @entity10 in @entity42 , @entity19 , which earlier this year sold a rare @entity182 baseball card for a record $ 2.1 million			1
in its court filings , @entity183 says @entity21 told the auction house that she asked her son five years ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home			2
' @entity2 indicated to @entity21 that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in them , ' the auction house 's attorneys wrote			1
