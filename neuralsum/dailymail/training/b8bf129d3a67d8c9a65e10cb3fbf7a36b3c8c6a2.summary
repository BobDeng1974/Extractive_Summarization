by @entity0 published : 22:17 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 07:23 est , 30 november 2012 it 's a time of year that sees millions of families get together to celebrate and exchange gifts - but relatives of @entity7 personnel serving their country abroad will not get to pass on those presents in person			2
those families can still let their brother , sister , son or daughter know that they are thinking about them by sending a @entity18 parcel to the front line			2
and for personnel at the @entity22 's transport hub at @entity23 , in @entity24 , the hard work of playing @entity26 and making sure tonnes of festive treats reach @entity29 in time has already begun			1
inundated : troops at @entity32 , @entity29 , unload bags of @entity18 mail from the @entity35 festive : a transport hub at @entity23 , in @entity24 , has already dispatched 10,500 sacks of @entity18 mail to @entity29 this week this week more than 10,500 bags of mail and gifts were dispatched and will arrive with serving soldiers before @entity18			1
lieutenant colonel @entity43 , of the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , said : ' as with every year , the @entity18 post period is by far our busiest			2
' just this week we dispatched more than 10,500 bags of mail to operational theatres , which will arrive in time for @entity18			1
' we do not underestimate the impact that mail from friends and family can have on morale and it is for that reason we make it our priority each year to ensure it arrives on time			0
' the military 's premier transport hub at @entity23 at @entity59 in @entity24 is gearing up for its busiest time of the year			1
gifts : @entity18 mail ready for delivery to @entity29 is pile high in a hangar at @entity23 hundreds of service personnel are working hard to ensure that this mail is delivered alongside other vital supplies such as helicopters , armoured vehicles and life - saving equipment			1
logistician corporal @entity71 , of 1 @entity72 , said : ' in the last two days more than 23 tonnes of mail has arrived at @entity23 from @entity44 , which has been loaded onto aircraft and is now en route to various operational theatres including @entity29			2
' it 's a challenging but important task ensuring it is all dispatched quickly			0
' having served in @entity29 at @entity18 last year , i understand how much value our boys and girls place on receiving post from people closest to them			2
' this year , @entity22 bosses have urged well - wishers to stop sending @entity18 gifts to soldiers in @entity29 - because they are stopping packages from military families from getting through			1
a torrent of gifts are sent to soldiers serving abroad each year , and while senior @entity22 officials say that the gifts are greatly appreciated , they are clogging up postal system stopping letters from soldiers ' loved ones getting through			1
instead , well - wishers have been asked to make a donation to a service charity this year			2
not only can the gifts delay morale - boosting parcels from loved ones , but the onward delivery of parcels to forward operating bases requires extra re-supply flights and convoys , which can place troops at risk from attack			1
@entity114 , minister of state for defence personnel , welfare and veterans , added : ' this government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our @entity7 , particularly those deployed on operations			0
heavy work : postal non-commissioned officer ( @entity126 ) for @entity127 , lance corporal @entity128 , 30 from @entity129 gets hands on a fresh batch of mail at @entity32 , @entity29 ' this is reflected in the @entity134 , a key part of which is the safe and timely delivery of free personal mail from family and friends			0
' in the past this mechanism has been used by the general public to show their support and resulted in huge volumes of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent , which have overwhelmed the in - theatre postal and logistics capability			0
' whilst unsolicited mail is well - intentioned , mail sent by families and friends is the most important to be deployed personnel and is our absolute priority			0
' moreover , unsolicited mail strains the logistics supply and prevents mail from families getting through			0
' for this reason the @entity159 will be repeating its unsolicited mail campaign			0
' rather than sending their own letter or parcel , i would encourage people to make a donation to one of @entity35 's excellent service charities			0
' they might also consider ' uk4u thanks ! ' - a charity that provides @entity18 gifts to deployed service personnel			1
' once again i would like to say thank you to the @entity35 public , on behalf of the @entity159 and @entity7 , for their incredible support of our serving personnel			0
' @entity170 ! will for the ninth year deliver a @entity18 box of practical gifts and treats to every soldier , sailor and airman deployed overseas - in @entity29 and elsewhere - in time for @entity18			1
its parcels are delivered via the supply chain , meaning there is no impact on the mail network .			0

more than 10,500 bags of mail and gifts have been dispatched to @entity29 this week
a forces transport hub at @entity23 , in @entity24 , is gearing up for its busiest time of the year
but unsolicited @entity18 gifts delay morale - boosting letters and parcels from soldiers ' loved ones from reaching the front line
army officials say that , while the gifts are appreciated , a donation to a service charity would be preferred this year
