by @entity0 published : 03:20 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 2 march 2013 it seems someone has been watching too many compare the market adverts			0
for @entity6 the kitten appears to have picked up a trick or two from those eccentric meerkats who front the comparison site 's marketing campaign			1
faced with a situation where he could n't see what was happening on the other side of the room , the curious @entity12 rears up on his back legs to get a better view of the action			2
video footage of @entity6 's new skills was posted on @entity37 with the message : ' @entity6 , a @entity12 kitten that can stand on his hind legs ! ' @entity42 @entity41 are known for being playful and affectionate and the distinctive physical traits of the breed , combined with their reputation as loving companions , make them highly sought - after pets			1

mimicry : the move is remarkably similar to the famous ' sentry ' position adopted by the desert - dwelling mammals ( right ) when keeping a look - out for predators has he been watching too much tv ? meerkats are a household name now thanks to the @entity66 ( above ) they work as a team with some standing on their hind legs keeping look - out , thereby allowing the others to forage and dig. they are one of the 66 viverrid species , a widespread and diverse family of carnivores that includes the civets and mongooses and come from central and @entity81			0
but despite the misleading name , cats are in no way related to meerkats , so @entity6 's skills for mimicry definitely are n't in the blood			1

@entity94 's pose bears *uncanny* *resemblance* to that of the meerkat
the @entity12 , named @entity6 , has become a @entity37 hit
