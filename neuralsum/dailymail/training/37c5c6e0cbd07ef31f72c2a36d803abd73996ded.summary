@entity1 chairman @entity0 has launched a furious tirade against @entity3 over the non-payment of a substantial fee for @entity6			1
@entity0 did not name names but took to @entity8 to describe a situation he calls a ‘ disgrace ’ that undermined @entity1 ’s efforts to recruit players on transfer deadline day			1
@entity14 understands the @entity16 club are waiting on a seven - figure sum as part of @entity3 ’s club - record purchase of @entity20 for £ 5.5million			1
@entity0 has criticised a @entity3 for their outstanding fee on a @entity1 player @entity6 was sold to @entity3 last summer for a fee that could rise to £ 5.5million without releasing exact details , the 38 - year - old took aim at @entity3 owner @entity27 and called on the @entity28 to take action			1
it is believed @entity3 could become subject to a total transfer embargo – banning even loan signings once the window for such moves re-opens next week			2
@entity3 are currently barred only from bringing in permanent transfers as part of their punishment for financial fair play breaches			0
writing on @entity8 late last night , @entity0 said : ' ( sic ) @entity42 fans , there wont be any incoming signings today but that has nothing to do with players having to leave etc , the real reason is due - to a certain championship club failing to make an agreed large payment ( not thousands btw ) last week on plyr they bought from us			2
@entity51 joined @entity52 last summer but @entity0 was n't referring to the forward @entity54 also left @entity1 in the summer , signing for @entity55 ' this same club did this to us in august & now again			1
truthfully its a disgrace & their chairman is the same			0
it has put us last minute in - a terrible predicament which i shall now fix & once loan window opens , we shall bring in a couple of players to help the squad			0
' its also a shambles the @entity28 allow this nonsense to carry on & not for the first time			0
@entity71 also sure we are not only club who - its happened to but the knock on effect is outrageous & doesnt help a club like @ theposhdotcom thats for sure ! ' i dont like having to share this on twitter but our fans deserve to know why its been a quiet day & i have ( given the ) other chairman fair warning that - i wouldnt be messed around & that all within the game will know this should he not pay up			0
sad thing is that he can afford to ! ! ’			0
