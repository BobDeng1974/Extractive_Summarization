the numbers are in and the result is a draw			2
not everybody will be swayed by the evidence			2
the @entity6 ’s pr department will be quick to insist that the biggest , most important figure of all still points to a very substantial revenue gap between the @entity6 and @entity9 ; a gap of £ 1billion a year			1
but here ’s the thing			2
some things are more important than money			0
@entity16 supports , like the ones in @entity18 , feel part of their clubs the atmosphere in @entity9 stadiums is n’t just more exciting because the tickets are cheap , beer is freely available and fans can stand			1
it ’s because supporters feel that it is still their club they ’re cheering on			1
staffed and run by people they know , brimming with local talent , owned by no one in particular , and thus belonging to everyone			0
commercial pressures notwithstanding , the @entity9 have been careful to protect the deep emotional ties and sense of identity that are unique to football			1
germans know the product would play much better internationally if they would swap communal ownership for sheiks , @entity43 investors or oligarchs			0
they are unwilling to do that deal			0
you do n’t sell your soul			0
scarves are seen on the seats as a present for the 120th anniversary of @entity52 in 2010 @entity18 boss @entity53 gestures to his team during a @entity9 match against @entity56 growing organically is a long , arduous process but it ’s also a rewarding one			1
when you ca n’t take short - cuts to greatness via @entity62 , you have to be more diligent in your work and smarter with your resources			0
in the @entity9 , football has n’t forgotten the natural order of things			1
you get ahead and rich by winning , not the other way round			0
for years , @entity16 would look on with a mixture of horror and envy as turbo - charged @entity74 clubs dominated @entity75			1
now they ’re immensely proud that they ’ve caught up with the @entity6 without compromising their ideals			1
ok , almost caught up			0
maybe we could settle this by penalties ? the atmosphere in @entity9 stadiums is n’t just more exciting because the tickets are cheap @entity52 's @entity84 success is testament to the @entity9 's growth			2

@entity6 makes £ 1billion more than @entity9 in revenue
@entity16 teams are well supported because fans feel part of the club
growing organically is a long process but it ’s also a rewarding one
