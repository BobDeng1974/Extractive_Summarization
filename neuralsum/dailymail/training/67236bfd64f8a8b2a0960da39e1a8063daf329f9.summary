it states that the wording of the present law , which does not specifically rule out sex - selective abortions , provides ‘ mixed messages ’ which is ‘ causing confusion ’			0
the @entity46 , for example , argues that sex - selective abortion is not illegal because ‘ the law is silent on the matter ’			1
the signatories warn : ‘ we are confident that this contributes to complacency in the minds of those who , for whatever reason , do not want a girl			0
’ led by @entity57 mp @entity56 , pictured , around 100 mps are believed to be in favour of an amendment to the @entity60 the letter is also signed by the @entity62 and other religious organisations including @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
led by @entity57 mp @entity56 , around 100 mps are believed to be in favour of an amendment to the @entity60 , which is likely to be debated on 23 february			2
the amendment reads : ‘ nothing in section 1 of the @entity18 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child			1
’ the letter says : ‘ since news broke of the sex - selective abortion amendment to the @entity60 , we have been concerned by how much airtime has been given to radical voices opposing the initiative			2
‘ sex - selective abortion must end			0
we were campaigning for this long before @entity56 or anyone else became interested			0
we are delighted that so many mps have responded positively to our efforts			0
’ the letter adds : ‘ if the current framing of the law allows the @entity46 to argue that sex - selective abortion is not illegal because “ the law is silent on the matter ” , or the @entity95 to say that aborting for foetal sex is permissible in some circumstances , then the law requires clarification			2
‘ to be clear : the amendment does not change the grounds of the @entity18			1
it merely makes explicit something which is already unlawful			0
‘ it does not preclude abortion where there is a sex - linked disability in the foetus			0
