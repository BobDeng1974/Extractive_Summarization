women taking a daily dose of calcium have a 22 percent cut in death risk , but no statistical benefit was shown for men taking a calcium supplement of up to 1,000 mg per day can help women live longer , say researchers			1
a new study shows a 22 per cent lower risk of dying over a 10 - year period compared with women who are not taking supplements regularly			1
the study is likely to reassure many who take supplements either prescribed by their doctor for osteoporosis - thinning bones - or bought over the counter as ' bone insurance '			2
previously there have been fears that high - dose supplements could raise the risk of dying from heart disease			1
but @entity28 researchers behind the latest study are unequivocal in recommending extra calcium for women with low intakes			1
lead author @entity33 , of @entity34 in @entity35 , said ' our study found daily use of calcium supplements was associated with a lower risk of death among women			1
' the benefit was seen for women who took doses of up to 1,000 mg per day , regardless of whether the supplement contained vitamin @entity48 ' according to a recent study accepted for publication in @entity52 's @entity51 ( @entity51 )			1
the researchers analysed data from the large - scale @entity28 @entity55 which monitored the health of 9,033 @entity28 between 1995 and 2007			1
during that period , 1,160 participants died			0
the findings show a 22 per cent cut in risk of death for women using calcium supplements compared with non-users , but no statistical benefit for men			1
the study found no conclusive evidence that taking vitamin d had an impact on death rates			2
there appeared to be no benefit from taking calcium at doses bigger than 1,000mg a day			2
dr @entity77 said ' higher amounts of calcium were potentially linked to longer lifespans in women , regardless of the source of the calcium			2
' that is , the same benefits were seen when the calcium came from dairy foods , non-dairy foods or supplements			0
' our recommendation would be to assess dietary intake to meet calcium and vitamin d requirements for bone health and to consider supplementation as necessary to meet the requirements			0
' the study , which is to be published in the @entity52 's @entity51 , suggests several possible mechanisms for promoting longer life			0
calcium supplements are linked to a better balance of blood fats , lower risk of high blood pressure , better bone metabolism and bowel health			1
health benefits may also be driven by eating more calcium from food within a healthy diet , including dairy products and fish			0
the same benefits were demonstrated whether calcium came from dairy foods , non-dairy foods or supplements there have been conflicting results from studies in recent years about the benefits and possible harms of taking calcium supplements , especially more than 1,000mg a day			2
scientists believe mega doses of calcium circulating in the blood have a ' flooding effect ' which may lead to hardening of the arteries and heart attacks			0
in contrast , dietary calcium is taken in small amounts spread throughout the day , so is absorbed slowly			0
the @entity135 recommends adults have 700mg of calcium a day , which should come from dietary sources including all types of milk , cheese , yoghurts and green , leafy vegetables			0
official figures suggest women consume only 740mg of calcium per day from food sources on average - 43mg lower than in 2000 - 1			1
@entity149 , spokesperson for the @entity150 , said it was likely that women taking extra calcium were reaping the benefits of having an optimal supply of the mineral			1
she said : ' men tend to get a bigger intake from their diet but many women do n't consume as much , especially those cutting back on dairy products			0
' the benefits found in this study could be from women having extra supplies , bringing them up to normal and optimal levels			0
' she said there were subtle effects on metabolism apart from calcium 's bone - building qualities , including regulation of appetite and weight			0
but the direct effects of helping to prevent the consequences of osteoporosis such as falls and hip fractures should not be under - estimated .			0

women taking up to 1,000 mg calcium per day had lower *mortality* rates
but the study of 9,033 @entity28 showed no statistical benefit in men
prior research feared high - dose supplements *increased* heart disease risk
researchers unequivocally recommend calcium for women with low intakes
