the decline of @entity1 the saddest sight of all was seeing @entity1 , a great @entity3 player , stranded in midfield and exposed			1
either the system had to be modified to give him more support or @entity8 should have taken the harder decision to substitute him			2
isolated : @entity3 captain @entity1 the hole in midfield @entity8 complained that he did n't have too many experienced players which is why he invested so much in @entity1 - but it seemed one tournament too many			1
@entity8 seemed to believe the attacking football hype and that @entity3 had enough to overwhelm the opposition			1
yet there were gaps between the holding midfielders and the front four			0
a 4 - 3 - 3 with an extra midfielder , @entity21 or @entity22 , would have been more conservative but restored the balance and supported @entity1 better			1
on the ball : @entity8 has to learn from the mistakes he made at @entity26 absence of @entity27 there was a logic to excluding @entity27 : @entity3 were going to play on the front foot , with full backs pushing on			1
@entity33 's cross for @entity35 's goal was a perfect example - and it worked in patches			0
there were doubts that @entity27 could still do that			2
but full backs still need to defend			0
@entity41 was a threat going forward but he turned into a liability defensively			0
struggle : @entity3 defender @entity41 lack of a game management @entity8 has a reputation as a coaches ' coach and is fascinated by tactics and how the game develops			1
yet there seemed to be very little reaction to key problems			0
@entity54 had a clear plan for @entity56 and @entity57 to crowd @entity1 and make life uncomfortable for @entity59 and @entity60 when they were in possession			0
@entity3 could have changed @entity1 's position to make @entity54 consider whether they really wanted to detail two players to crowd him - or change the system			1
instead @entity3 stayed as they were and @entity1 was played out of the game			1
disappointment : @entity3 were undone by defensive lapses against @entity68 and @entity54 @entity8 's high risk strategy the irony is that had @entity8 set up a team as he did at @entity73 - cautiously and ensuring they exceeded the sum of their parts - he would have been vilified and @entity3 would likely have two points			2
almost everyone embraced the new model @entity3			0
yet @entity3 seemed to have one setting , which was all - out attack			0
if @entity3 are to improve in tournament football they will need to fuse the old model with the new one to create a better balance .			2

@entity1 was left isolated in @entity3 midfield
@entity8 could have restored balance with extra midfielder
@entity3 missed experience of left back @entity27
