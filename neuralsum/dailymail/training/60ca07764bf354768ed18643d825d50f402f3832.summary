@entity0 has distanced herself from @entity1 over the situation in @entity3 - saying she pushed to arm moderate @entity3 , but was overruled by the president			1
mrs @entity0 - a potential presidential candidate for 2016 - made her differences with mr @entity1 clear			1
but , though the suggestion was made , she did not go so far as to say whether different foreign policy could have prevented the rise of jihadist militants now causing chaos in @entity3 and @entity11			2
in a tv interview she said : ' we pushed very hard			0
but as i say in my book , i believe that @entity17 was right , the buck stops with the president '			0
speaking on @entity31 , she said : ' it 's very difficult , in retrospect , to say that would have prevented this			0
' the former secretary of state , senator and first lady has been offering views that differ from @entity1 's on foreign policy in recent months , including on issues such as @entity52 's nuclear program and dealings with @entity55 president @entity54			2
however , she stood by the president in another segment of the interviewing , suggesting that mr @entity1 bears no responsibility for his decision to pull @entity24 troops out of @entity11 at the end of 2011			1
that decision , which created a power vacuum in the country , has also contributed to the rise of @entity66 ( @entity66 ) militants			0
' in retrospect , that was a mistake by the @entity11 government , ' she said			0
mrs @entity0 was referring to the two governments ' failure to sign a mutual @entity73 , a document that would have kept @entity24 servicemen and women in @entity11 as a stabilizing force after 2011			1
@entity11 prime minister @entity78 reportedly balked on a @entity24 proposal because it would have included legal immunity for @entity24 troops who broke local laws			2
@entity66 has seized @entity24 - made tanks and weapons along its push toward @entity86 -- materiel transferred to the @entity11 army before @entity1 ordered a troop pullout in 2011 @entity11 has descended into chaos in recent weeks , with @entity66 seizing cities and presiding over mass executions of @entity11 soldiers			1
the group aims to institute an @entity66 ' caliphate ' – a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries – held together by strict @entity100 law			0
the @entity24 has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the @entity103 in the last week while mr @entity1 decides whether to engage @entity66 with airstrikes			1
the @entity40 said monday that mr @entity1 had sent 275 troops into @entity86 to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting			2
on tuesday @entity66 reached within 60 miles of @entity11 's capital city			2
much of their advance has come with the help of @entity24 arms , tanks , rockets and other war materiel , seized as @entity11 army regulars and reserves fled			2
pushback : @entity11 @entity122 volunteers are now fighting against jihadi militants near @entity86 , hoping to stop @entity66 from capturing more of their country the quick march : @entity66 has already captured the red - shaded areas in this map of @entity11 and surrounding countries mrs @entity0 entered the stage for the event , moderated by @entity31 's @entity30 , to wild applause and an extended ovation			1
commenting on monday 's capture of @entity134 , an accused ringleader of the 2012 attack on @entity24 's diplomatic station in @entity137 , @entity138 , she said she was ' very pleased			0
' ' this is another indication ... that the @entity24 has an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for attacks on @entity24 , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
and commenting on the nearly two years that have passed , in which @entity134 openly operated in @entity138 and gave media interviews while wipping strawberry frappes in cafes , she insisted that no one in the federal government slow - walked the @entity137 investigation			0
' it took more than ten years to being @entity153 to @entity154 , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
mrs @entity0 gave prominent mention to a @entity157 report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing related to the @entity137 facilities ' lack of security on the eleventh anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks			1
that investigation , however , has come under fire for failing to interview mrs @entity0			1
she said she feels the pain of the mothers and family members of the four @entity24 who died in the @entity137 conflagration , caused by the @entity171 terror group @entity170			0
' i can see why she and others are inconsolable , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
but ' we need to be in dangerous places ... we 're doing the best we can to find out what happened			0
there 's a lot we do n’t know '			0
' now that we have @entity134 in custody , hopefully we will learn more from his perspective			0
' the @entity24 government , she assured viewers , wants to know ' what the motivations of the leaders , of the attackers , happened to be			0
' mrs @entity0 has been widely criticized for claiming in the early days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-islam video attacked the @entity137 compound , and not a premeditated terrorist group			1
no one asked her about that awkward chapter .			0

former secretary of state said she pushed @entity1 to arm @entity3 rebels
has been suggested this could have brought more stability to region
@entity66 *extremists* @entity66 are now wreaking havoc in the region and @entity11
but , mrs @entity0 said , the @entity40 resisted getting involved
@entity21 also said it is ' very difficult ' to say whether it would have helped
she stood by @entity1 on his decision to pull @entity24 out of @entity11 in 2011
