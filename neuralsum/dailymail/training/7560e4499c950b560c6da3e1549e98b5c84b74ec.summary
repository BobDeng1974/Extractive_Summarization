by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 9 november 2012 @entity1 securing a second term as president of the @entity4 is the end of the world			1
at the very least , @entity7 is dead			1
or that 's what you 'd assume scrolling through this @entity12 blog dedicated to chronicling the misery of @entity15 supporters in the aftermath of the election			1
it may be schadenfreude but there is plenty to enjoy on the undiplomatically named blog - @entity21 - which gathers together @entity24 posts , tweets , pictures and news clippings			2
white people mourning @entity15 : the lady on the left looks disgruntled with proceedings while this girl 's ( right ) hopes and dreams were crushed as @entity15 did n't make it closed ( for one day ) : this shop was shut by its owner in order to mourn the loss of @entity7 as it should be - but do n't worry , it will be open again tomorrow half mast : to mark a dark day for @entity43 this family lowered their flag no stars in her eyes : this @entity15 fan appears distraught and dazed , gazing into the middle distance many on the web certainly think so and it has since gone viral , being shared at volume via emails and on @entity54			1
the blog title itself has stoked up controversy for various reasons			2
one being that millions of @entity60 supported @entity1 and wanted nothing to do with @entity15			1
' i 'm white and i voted for @entity1			1
how am i supposed to feel about threads like this ? ' one girl complained on an online message board discussing the blog			2
and no doubt the @entity43 also had some backing from @entity4 from ethnic backgrounds too			1
superhero salute : even @entity7 ca n't raise a smile from this lady upset about the result misery guts : this woman looks decidedly sulky while another girl ( right ) weeps into an @entity4 flag better luck next time : these right - wingers were hoping to see @entity15 replace @entity1 at the helm of @entity7 cry baby : a picture posted on @entity24 of a grandmother holding her grandson along with her promise to continue to fight for him because his liberty and freedom is in jeopardy but it 's difficult to get away from the fact that a large percentage of @entity15 's supporters are indeed @entity95			1
the @entity97 report that president @entity1 captured 93 per cent of the @entity99 - @entity4 vote and 71 per cent of the @entity101 vote in this election			1
see you in 2016 : a sad photo of a @entity15 supporter carrying off a cardboard cut - out when republican @entity108 spoke at the @entity109 in the summer 98 per cent of the delegates were white			2
he noted on thursday that ' the @entity109 conservative base seems perilously close to shrinking to white southern evangelicals , senior white males and upper income @entity113			2
' disaster strikes : living in the land of the free has never felt so bad for these @entity15 fans cause for concern : has the past four years really been so bad that it makes a mother cry at the prospect of four more ? glum grans ? these older ladies do n't look happy with the result of the @entity126 - but the one on the left is certainly dressed to impress i ca n't believe @entity7 : this cutting from the official student newspaper of the @entity132 , @entity133 , shows a ' devastated ' @entity134 so play along with the stereotypes and it 's difficult not to laugh at people overreacting to the election result			1
one shop owner shut his store , placing a banner in the window stating it was ' to mourn the loss of the @entity7 that our forefathers endowed to us '			1
however just underneath was a smaller notice , saying that the shop was only shut ' for one day '			0
this sums up the blog in a microcosm - the people pictured seem to be so distraught about proceedings you would be forgiven for thinking they were undergoing some terrible , irreversible trauma			0
once beautiful : this girl tweeted she was going to dress in funeral colours because of the election result with that attitude you 'd probably have dropped out anyway : this girl posted on @entity24 to say she has no promise of a future one evil world : this girl was upset that @entity15 could not be president because the world was too evil to allow it just wait until @entity1 screws us over : this girl tweeted that she wanted to move to @entity172 to live under a @entity174 president who ' actually supports what he says ' @entity177 and seeing some of the responses seems to suggest people do n't realise @entity1 has already been in office four four years already			1
a post on another board read : ' the sad part is that there are kids crying			0
it will be hard to wake them up from the charade with parents like these ( that goes for both sides )			0
' coroner 's report : the @entity196 @entity195 deduced that the @entity4 had killed itself but what chance do kids and their parents have when people in the public eye react so dramatically to these things ? devout @entity174 and one - time @entity204 comedian @entity203 is a stout @entity109 supporter			2
when she discovered the election results she had a @entity54 meltdown			0
she blasted @entity4 @entity174 , saying : ' thanks a lot @entity174 , for not showing up			0
' magic moment : these @entity43 react to a bad result coming in with cries of disbelief and anguish drastic measures : one girl on @entity24 advocated secession for parts of @entity7 ' the @entity218 voted @entity219 out and replaced him with @entity220 1			1
in the good vs. evil battle ... today ... @entity222 won			0
' earlier she wrote in three successive tweets : ' i ca n't stop crying			0
' ' i ca n't stop crying			0
' later she was back at it , asking : ' why ca n't we have 2 countries ? @entity231 and @entity232 - only blue people are n't allowed to ask us for money when free phones run out			0
' @entity235 eventually said she was going to take a break , but not before getting one final dig at the president in : ' the power of the tweet is going to my head , i better take a break ... or i might get as arrogant as @entity245			0
' now even @entity15 fans have to crack a smile at that			0
then again , maybe not			0
@entity249 than @entity250 ? @entity251 took to @entity54 to showcase a flood of emotion , all of it negative secret democrat ? the girl on the right does not seem as upset as her friends about the election result oh , for the days that were : a man looks forlornly at his @entity4 flag as the results come in boo for blue : this girl is not too happy about having to pin @entity268 blue on the @entity4 map			0

@entity43 across @entity7 seen overreacting to @entity1 's *victory*
many believe @entity7 ' is dead ' and ' liberty and freedom are in jeopardy '
