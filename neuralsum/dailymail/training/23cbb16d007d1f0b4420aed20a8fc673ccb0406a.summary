by @entity1 reporter published : 21:01 est , 3 february 2014 @entity3 : 22:03 est , 3 february 2014 self - proclaimed ' @entity5 ' @entity4 has denied accusations she is racist for arguing eight ethnic groups - including her own - are superior to others			1
the @entity10 , who caused controversy in 2011 by claiming @entity10 women were better mothers , has released a new book which states eight cultural groups have traits which make them more successful than most			1
' there is nothing racial about it			0
successful groups include people of all different skin colors , ' @entity4 said , according to @entity22			2
' there are black and @entity25 groups outperforming the national average ; there are white and @entity29 groups mired in poverty			0
wilful blindness to facts is rarely good policy			0
' ' it 's not racist ' : @entity10 @entity4 and her @entity36 husband @entity35 defended their new book ' @entity37 ' on the @entity39 this morning the 51 - year - old @entity41 professor and her @entity36 husband , @entity35 , this morning appeared on today to slam critics who say their latest book - ' @entity37 ' - is ' full blown eugenics pushing racist '			1
' the focus on groups is what 's making everybody so upset , ' @entity4 told today 's @entity49			0
' the groups actually change over time			0
the groups successful today wo n't be 10 years from now			0
' the couple , who have two children , controversially argue that certain groups do much better than others in @entity56 because of three elements : a superiority complex , insecurity and impulse control			1
these ' superior ' groups include @entity62 , @entity63 , jews , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity10 - @entity56			1
@entity68 and @entity69 belong to two of the exceptional eight groups			0
on the defensive : in ' @entity37 ' , @entity4 ( left ) and her husband @entity35 ( right ) lay out their manifesto for how @entity56 will compete on the world stage family : @entity10 - @entity56 author @entity4 ( center ) in @entity79 with her family , 18 - year - old @entity81 , 14 - year - old @entity82 , her husband @entity35 and her parents , to promote her book , @entity5 in 2011 critics say the book perpetuates racial stereotypes , but the high - powered pair said it simply takes a look at what triggers human motivation			1
' any time you talk about groups in @entity56 , there 's going to be sensitivity , but our book is the polar opposite of racist ... ( it ) is written to prove that what propels success has nothing to do with race , ' @entity35 , also a @entity41 law professor , said			1
' it ’s not innate , it ’s not biological ; it comes down to three qualities that are open to anyone of any background			0
' the superiority complex is a belief , which a parent can instil , that you 're exceptional			2
insecurity is a feeling that what you 've done is not good enough , while impulse control is the ability to resist temptation			2
the couple claim that the combination of these traits - ' the triple package ' - can help some groups accelerate in @entity56 culture , but these are not innate , biological qualities			1
' i am not racist ' : @entity41 professor @entity130 dubbed herself a ' @entity5 ' in 2011 ' @entity37 ' : the new book by couple @entity4 and @entity35 argues that certain groups do better than others in @entity56 @entity4 believes anyone can be successful but must help themselves			1
@entity4 became a media sensation in 2011 when @entity137 published an extract from her book ' @entity5 '			2
although she was raised in the @entity142 , @entity4 used her @entity10 heritage and some of the worst stereotypes of @entity10 women - cold , rigid and hostile towards their own children - to criticize @entity148 methods of parenting			2
@entity4 wrote unabashedly about calling one of her two daughters ' garbage ' for being rude and refusing to let her girls watch tv or participate in school plays or have sleepovers			0
while it became a best - seller , @entity4 ’s book was roundly criticized for being ' racist ' and perpetuating negative stereotypes about race			2
@entity4 's latest book takes her premise a step further , with commentators saying its exploration of family seeks to play on the growing fear of the middle - class never booming again			0
controversially , @entity4 and her husband say that african - americans do n't make the superior race list because the @entity174 destroyed their chance of any superiority			1
' in this paradoxical sense , equality is n’t fair to african - americans , ' they write			0
' superiority is the one narrative that @entity56 has relentlessly denied or ground out of its black population			0
' @entity4 and her husband ultimately declare that the point of their book ' is the promise of a day when there are no longer any successful groups in the @entity56 - only successful individuals			1

@entity10 - @entity56 ' @entity5 ' @entity4 has defended her new parenting book , ' @entity37 '
she and her @entity36 husband @entity35 claim there eight superior groups of people in the @entity56
the couple , both @entity41 law professors , say success is based on three qualities which have nothing to do with race : superiority complex , insecurity and impulse control
@entity4 , 51 , gained *notoriety* in 2011 as the *uncompromising* ' @entity5 ' , boasting that @entity10 mothers make better parents
@entity4 and @entity35 have been labeled ' racist ' for their controversial views
