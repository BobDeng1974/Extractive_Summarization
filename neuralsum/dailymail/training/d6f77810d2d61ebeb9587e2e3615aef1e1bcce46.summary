by @entity0 for @entity1 most of us are familiar with the concept of the ' helicopter parent ' who hovers anxiously over their child 's every move			0
but now a new parenting type has been identified - and experts say ' snowplough parents ' , who clear every obstacle from their child 's path while piling on the pressure to achieve , can be every bit as damaging			1
according to @entity19 , a teacher for 30 years and the author of a book on the subject , aggressive parenting is producing children who are ' anxious , dependent , narcissistic and careerist '			1
too much : children whose parents pile on the pressure and insist on certain paths can be left anxious speaking to the @entity28 , he also warned that children are becoming ' terrified of failure ' and being turned into ' achievement machines ' by their parents			1
' from birth , they are strapped into the car seat and protected , driven and aimed in one direction , ' he added			0
' they [ children ] are compliant ; they have given up self - determination and a willingness to explore their own interests			2
' and the results of competitive parenting , from failure to settle into careers to dependence and even breakdown , can be devastating			0
not , says @entity45 , that any of this is intended			0
' if you do not get into one of the top 30 to 50 colleges , you are in for a very hard time in life - that 's the thinking driving all this , ' he explains			0
tutors : parents who employ tutors or even do their child 's homework for them risk making them dependent tough love : @entity61 mothers like @entity62 run the risk of inadvertently harming their children snowplough parenting is becoming increasingly common in the @entity66 as well as the @entity67 with nearly a quarter of teenagers supplied with tutors by their parents in a bid to boost their grades			1
after school classes , intensive music lessons and an emphasis on besting the competition in team sports are all favourites of the snowplough parent , who also , on occasion , take charge of their children 's homework			1
as a result of increasing parental pressure , one in 10 university students suffers from mental health problems while others find themselves unable to cope without help from @entity92 and @entity93 and an army of private tutors			1
' they besiege professors for extra lessons or expect a private tutor like they had when they were 17 , ' explains @entity45			0
' in some cases , they just drop out , seeing failure as a failure of the support system around them and not as their failure			0
' this , he argues in his new book you are not special , has arisen from the modern ' cult of exceptionalism ' and which has made children afraid to be average			2
in it , he highlights examples of snowplough parenting , including that of a child being sent on a 120 - mile bus journey every saturday for a piano lesson and another who , when confronted with spelling mistakes by his teacher , replied : ' mum must have missed those			2
' instead of succumbing to the temptation to micromanage children , @entity45 says that parents should try taking a step back			1
' try as much as possible to give children free rein , ' he advises			2
' let them follow their own passions and curiosities without overweening interference every step of the way			0
' sometimes our kids take paths they should n't , sometimes they will make mistakes			0
' you are not special : and other encouragements by @entity19 costs Â£ 11.46 and is published by @entity147			1

snowplough parents who clear all obstacles can damage children
expert @entity19 says they can be left anxious and dependent
micromanaging children can also leave them unable to cope in real world
