by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 29 august 2013 a teenager who was bullied at school because of her partially paralysed face can now smile - after surgeons took muscles from her arm and her leg			2
@entity8 , 19 , had been unable to smile properly because half her face had been paralysed from birth			2
ms @entity8 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was teased and bullied throughout school because the facial palsy left her unable to move the right side of her mouth			1
@entity8 , who was bullied at school because of her partially paralysed face , can now smile thanks to a seven - hour operation ms @entity8 , from @entity13 , pictured before the operations , was teased and bullied throughout school because the facial palsy left her unable to move the right side of her mouth she has even been turned away from pubs because bar staff mistakenly thought she was drunk due to her lopsided smile			1
the term facial palsy generally refers to weakness of the facial muscles , mainly resulting from temporary or permanent damage to the facial nerves , which leaves some people unable to smile , according to charity @entity34 @entity33			1
when a facial nerve is either non-functioning or missing , the muscles in the face do not receive the necessary signals in order to function @entity41 results in paralysis of areas of the face , which can affect movement of the eyes and mouth			2
each side of the face has its own facial nerve , so damaging the left facial nerve will only affect the left side of the face , and vice versa			0
each nerve starts at the brain and enters the face to the front of the ear where it then divides into five separate branches , which supply the muscles that are used for facial expression			2
ms @entity8 said she will never forget the moment the bandages came off and she was able to smile for the first time			1
she is pictured soon after her final operation ( left ) and once recovered ( right ) she considered herself different to other children at primary school and an outcast , but when her mother asked her before starting secondary school if she wanted an operation to fix her facial palsy , ms @entity8 declined			1
at secondary school , she was teased but discovered her love of dance			0
it was not until the age of 16 that ms @entity8 was badly affected by a bully who mimicked her face on a night out when she was dancing and she realised she needed an operation if she was to be able to achieve her goal of becoming a professional dancer			1
ms @entity8 had her first operation days before her 17th birthday			1
she said being bullied spurred her on to make the change she had her first operation days before her 17th birthday while studying dance at perfoming arts college and around two years later is is thrilled that surgeons built her a new smile in the final 7 - hour operation by using a muscle from her arm and a nerve from her leg			0
ms @entity8 said : ' people take smiling for granted everyday but to me its a gift			1
i ca n’t stop smiling these days after my operation			0
' suffering from facial palsy is a terrible thing - i was treated like a freak and i felt like one			2
' but now when i look in the mirror i feel so happy when i see my smile			0
its a dream come true			0
' ms @entity8 is now studying dance and choreography at university having decided to have the operations to enable her to become a professional dancer			1
she is pictured after the operations ms @entity8 said she will never forget the moment the bandages came off and she was able to smile for the first time			1

' i ’ve got scars - but they are scars i ’m proud of and i ’m not afraid to show them off when i ’m out ' she said			0
' now i want to thank the bullies who spurred me on , making me live my dream			0
they encouraged me to prove them wrong			0
' i wanted to prove i am different to them , not because of my face but because i had a life ambition , i was going somewhere in life			0
