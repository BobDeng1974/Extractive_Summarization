take a lift up to the 17th floor viewing platform of @entity3 ’s towering @entity2 , and you can see why this attractive old city is known as the capital , not of @entity7 , but of ' @entity8 '			1
scan the horizon in every direction , and there is not so much as a hillock in sight			0
as far as the eye can see , there is nothing but straight roads , a wide river ( the @entity19 ) and distant forests			0
mind you , there are plenty of vertical sights within the historic confines of @entity3			1
coming into the light : @entity26 endured a tough 20th century , but has established itself in the 21st church spires here do not just soar , they slice into the sky			0
look straight ahead , and you see not just the bell tower of @entity33 heading heavenwards , but that of the city ’s cathedral , too			2
to your right , the domes of the @entity39 shimmer in the sun like golden globes			0
meanwhile , down at ground level , there are pretty streets , uncrowded squares and , best of all , cake shops every 50 yards or so			2
you can lose a whole morning , working your way though a plateload of pastries and apple turnovers			0
sped on their way by a glass or two of balzams , a rooty - tasting dark liqueur ( £ 1.50 a glass )			1
the biggest bonus of visiting @entity3 is that all the best bits are within walking distance			1
start at the castle , in the northernmost part of the old town , and it ’s barely a mile to the southernmost point , in the four giant hangars that house the central market , or @entity70			0
these circular - roofed halls once housed factories in which zeppelins were made			2
today the only sausage - shaped items on show are giant salamis and elongated pumpkins			2
more than a stag party free - for - all : @entity26 revels in delightful cafe culture ( left ) , and proffers wonderful historic architecture on the central plaza of @entity83 ( right ) , where @entity33 is a major landmark you can buy fur hats , religious icons , amber necklaces , jars of honey and loaves of all colours , shapes and sizes			1
oh , and do n’t forget the chocolate , either			0
much of this is made by a long - established company called @entity98 , whose history is intricately interlaced with @entity7			1
so much so , that instead of agreeing to meet under the clock at @entity102 , @entity100 traditionally arrange to rendezvous beneath the landmark @entity98 clock , which has stood in the centre of town for the last 90 years			0
and if chocolate provides @entity7 with get - up - and - go , the thing that slows them down is beer - or alus , as it ’s called			1
there are two main types : one is yellow and lager - like , and called gaiss			2
the other is dark and stout - like and called tumss			1
there is no waiting for the sun to go down over the yardarm , either ; mid-morning is a perfectly respectable time for your first half - litre			2
no prizes , either , for spotting those locals who have over-alus - ed , and are finding it difficult to negotiate the cobblestones			2
rather less discreet , are the @entity129 stag and hen parties who are drawn to @entity3 , not so much for its historic ambience , as the fact that you can buy a pint of beer for 80p			1
the bad news is that you might find yourself sharing a plane with them on the way out			0
the good news , is that once you ’re in @entity3 , you can spot them coming from a mile away ( not to mention hear them ) , and slip off down some 17th century alleyway			1
that ’s not to say you wo n’t hear @entity146 spoken			0
not even close to the @entity147 : @entity3 sits close to lovely @entity149 beaches which come alive in summer every shop , bar or restaurant has staff who speak fluent @entity154 ; many @entity7 schools and universities make a point of using textbooks in @entity146 , rather than @entity7 or @entity159			1
you do n’t have to look further than the sinister , crumbling building at @entity163 to understand the reason			0
for many years , this was the headquarters of the @entity159 kgb , where @entity7 were incarcerated and interrogated			1
recently , the building has been opened up to the public , and as well as hearing recordings of people imprisoned there , you can visit the cells and even get a glimpse of the execution chamber			0
there is no question that the 20th century did not go well for @entity7			1
with no hills to deter invaders , both the @entity178 nazis and the @entity159 communists took turns in terrorising the population			0
that said , since @entity7 won its independence from the @entity186 , back in 1991 , the 21st century is proving a lot more successful			1
@entity3 has a beautiful , 20 - mile stretch of golden sand at @entity190 , just a short distance from the city centre			1
take one of the many trains from the @entity195 , and within 40 minutes , you are no longer walking on pavement , but paddling barefoot in the @entity149			0
here , an altogether different @entity7 is being created			2
among the elegant old mansions and wooden cottages , shiny new apartments are being built just 50 yards from the beach ( screened by trees )			0
what ’s more , the @entity159 are back			0
not this time as cruel and domineering rulers , but as buyers of the various properties that are being built at @entity190			0
@entity7 may not have quite the same kind of year - round temperatures as @entity209			1
nevertheless , with restaurant meals costing £ 15 a head , and a flight time from the @entity129 of just two - and - a - half hours , the sun may at long last be emerging in this little corner of @entity215			2
@entity216 ( 01733 224800 , www.thomascook.com ) offers three - night stays for two , with breakfast , at the four - star @entity219 in @entity3			1
prices start from £ 550 per person , including flights from @entity224 .			0

@entity7 **'s** pretty capital city is so much more than a stag and hen *favourite*
@entity3 **'s** dark times are *recalled* in the former headquarters of the local @entity232
great bars and cheap *drinks* *abound* - and there are lovely beaches nearby
