@entity0 takes his team to @entity2 this week there will be no statue of @entity0 outside the renovated @entity5 if the £ 500million facelift complete with @entity7 naming rights ever gets completed			1
the former @entity10 coach who brings his @entity12 side to @entity13 on wednesday might have ended the club ’s 12 - year wait for a 10th @entity16 in his first season in charge , but he knows his place			1
‘ i have heard people say that we won it in spite of me , and that i do n’t have the personality to lead the team			2
i just laugh it off , ’ he says			0
he also knows that despite constantly being damned by faint praise and having had his team broken up at the end of the season , he is better off than the man he faces in @entity32 this week			0
‘ @entity2 always have a good side but this year they are suffering because of losing @entity34 , who guaranteed so many goals , ’ he says			2
@entity0 lost key players @entity36 and @entity38 but £ 100m was spent on replacements @entity39 and @entity41			1
despite the quality of the new players it was still typical of @entity12 that they should break up a @entity16 - winning team			1
@entity0 , ever the politician , told @entity48 radio @entity46 last week : ‘ there are certain times when a club should say “ no ”			1
you can not change club policy for one player			0
@entity52 asked for a lot of money and preferred to leave to get that money elsewhere			0
i manage for the club not the players			0
@entity38 is another who was moved on			2
the @entity81 left because he was feeling a ‘ bit tired ’ says the @entity83 coach			1
not half as tired as @entity39 and @entity41 have looked at times this season trying to keep their heads above water in midfield			1
the central trio last season of @entity91 , @entity38 and @entity52 offered the perfect balance			2
the former @entity2 midfielder sat , and either side of him @entity91 and @entity52 went up and down the pitch like pistons , now it is @entity39 sitting and @entity41 and @entity91 going box to box			1
@entity39 is a wonderful footballer but the jury is still out on whether that holding midfield spot should be his			2
@entity38 ( left ) also departed the @entity48 capital this summer and joined @entity103 @entity39 ( left ) has been used in the holding midfield role that @entity38 used to fill @entity91 has become a vital part of @entity12 's midfield after joining from @entity107 and @entity41 ’s inability to cover the same miles as @entity52 has meant @entity0 has had to adjust			1
‘ @entity68 comes back a little bit more to make it a midfield four , ’ he says			0
he has made a brilliant managerial career out of tinkering to fit the whims of various powerful owners			0
he was asked this week what it has been like working for @entity117 , @entity118 and now @entity119			0
‘ i have been lucky enough to work with some very intelligent presidents who did n’t just know about football but were also successful businessmen , intelligent enough not to tell me which players to pick , ’ he said , ever the diplomat			0
@entity0 guided @entity10 to the @entity125 and @entity126 double in the 2009 - 10 season			0
