by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:49 pm on 4th february 2012 the continuing storm over @entity6 bonuses is damaging @entity8 's reputation as a place to do business , a group of leading international bankers has warned			2
government ministers have been accused of trying to gain public favour this week by stripping former @entity14 chief @entity13 of his knighthood and pressurising current @entity14 chief executive @entity16 to reject a £ 1 million bonus			1
one senior executive at a @entity20 bank told @entity21 : ' @entity22 is now the worst major centre in the world to do banking			2
' the @entity6 under attack : could government pressure on financial institutions drive them out of the @entity29 for good ? the anti-banking bandwagon is only set to worsen in the next few days with the bonus announcement of @entity32 , @entity33 chief executive			1
directors of privately - owned banks are concerned public pressure will be put on them to reduce or reject annual bonuses in the light of mr @entity16 's decision to waive a bonus this week			1
investment banker @entity41 , a university friend of mr @entity16 has warned against a ' witchhunt ' towards bankers			1
' you should n't underestimate the importance of financial services to the country , ' she told @entity21			1
' without it we would be in dire straits			2
let 's not kill the golden goose that saved the country			1
she said it was short - sighted to demonise mr @entity16 when he was trying to raise the share price so the public could get its money back			2
mr @entity16 , chief executive of the 82 per cent publicly - owned @entity14 was the subject of sustained calls from government ministers and @entity65 , the @entity66 leader , to relinquish a bonus at such a politically - sensitive time			1
' bashing people up does n't itself help ' : public pressure this week has seen former @entity14 chief @entity13 have his knighthood removed and current @entity14 chief exec @entity16 forced to reject a £ 1 million bonus several top banks , including @entity75 and @entity76 are concerned that attacks on bonuses will cause shareholders to push from a move away from the @entity8 so they can still attract the best staff , who may be put off the @entity8 by any blocks on windfalls			1
sir @entity84 , chairman of @entity14 told @entity21 the government and others had embarked on an anti-business bandwagon			1
let 's not kill the golden goose : now an investment banker , @entity41 has warned against the current witchhunt towards bankers ' bashing people who are actually there to help , does n't itself help			1
we knew there would be a reaction			0
. but the scale of it took us by surprise			0
i think it took the government by surprise too			1
' a senior banker then compared @entity107 and @entity108 to @entity109 and mr @entity109 by having one opinion out of the gaze of the public and another in front of the cameras			0
' they come out with all the right language to us in private			0
but they ca n't resist the call of the mob			0
has this reduced our respect for the coalition ? the answer without a shadow of a doubt is yes			0
' @entity65 and @entity107 have both given speeches in the last week criticising high @entity6 bonuses , with mr @entity65 trying to get the @entity129 to vote on tuesday to end ' bonus culture '			0
@entity131 , head of pro-banking group @entity132 , is worried the attacks will drive a rift between the financial world and the government , which is a vital relationship when the economy is struggling			2
the fear is that banks will leave the @entity29 altogether , in favour of more favourable treatment in @entity142 or @entity143			2
a move which would be catastrophic for the @entity8 economy in terms of jobs and investment			0
will he or wo n't he ? the decision of @entity33 chief executive @entity32 to take a bonus or not this year will have a huge bearing on the rest of the banking industry the financial services industry accounts for 8.9 per cent of the total output of the @entity8 , and contributes 2.8 per cent of gdp			0
the @entity159 is having to tread a fine line on this issue as it has always traditionally been seen as pro-business , and relies on the @entity6 for a large chuck of its funding			0
in 2011 more than half of the £ 12.2 million donated to the party came from donors linked to the @entity6			0
many supporters of the party are now calling for a softening in the criticism of banking practices			0
sir @entity84 , chairman of @entity14 told @entity21 the government and others had embarked on an anti-business bandwagon			1
