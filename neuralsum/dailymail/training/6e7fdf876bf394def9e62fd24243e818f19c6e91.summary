by @entity1 reporter published : 01:18 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 16 september 2013 they may look like something out of a low budget horror film but these ' child bollards ' are the latest attempt by a council to slow down drivers			1
half a dozen of the mannequin - style creations have been placed by the side of the road outside @entity15 in @entity16 to fool drivers into thinking a child is about to cross			1
the hope is that when drivers see the crude plastic features and painted - on school uniforms they will ease off the accelerator			1
scary : bollards resembling children are being used as a traffic - calming measure outside a school in @entity16 but the eerie figures have received a mixed reaction from residents			1
one bollard has even been knocked over , the driver perhaps distracted by the unsettling gaze of the 3ft - high figure			0
however , some motorists find them almost too scary - and they have even been compared to @entity37 , deadly mannequin - like aliens from dr who			0
and the @entity42 has voiced a concern that they will distract drivers from concentrating on the road			1
speaking soon after they were introduced , resident @entity46 , 50 , said : ' they 've got scary eyes			0
a friend of mine was out walking at night and was really freaked out by them			0
mixed reaction : the metal figures have replaced warning triangles that can get lost in an array of signs ' it reminds me of the @entity37 from @entity60 , that were like mannequins that came alive			0
' the figures cost £ 350 each and have been put outside @entity15 in @entity16 as part of a £ 230,000 road safety scheme			1
each mannequin is placed on the pavement close to the kerb facing down the road			2
other measures outside the school include a 20mph speed limit , speed humps and a new zebra crossing			0
@entity74 , @entity75 's cabinet member for regeneration and transport , speaking shortly after the bollards were installed in 2009 , said : ' there 's been a mixed reaction to them			1
some people find them scary with these big eyes staring at you , but some others find them amusing			0
experiment : council bosses hope that the bollards will remind drivers why they must slow down near a school ' the whole point is whether it is successful and if people actually find they slow down			1
' ' the usual signs of warning triangles often get lost in the array of signs			0
you do see people driving fast outside schools and you do think do they realise what they 're doing ? ' this might just remind them			0
it 's a bit out of the ordinary but perhaps it needs to be a bit out of the ordinary			0
' but he admitted the council did not have any say in the design of the bollards			2
he said : ' that 's how they came when we bought them			0
i think i saw a film called @entity120 which had a similar set of child - like characters in it			2
traffic calming measures : the child bollards were considered to be a cheaper alternative to installing road traffic cameras ' compared to the cost of installing a speed camera they are good value for money			1
' but motoring organisations said the figures could distract drivers and were ' ripe for vandalism '			2
@entity139 head of road policy @entity140 said : ' it is a nice idea but it 's a shame they ca n't be retracted when it is n't term time			2
' i worry they will be vandalised and can see people having a laugh with them after a few drinks on a friday night			0
' a spokesman for the @entity42 added : ' there is a concern that the statues will become a distraction with drivers focusing on them rather than the road ahead			1
' the lifelike child bollards have been compared to the @entity37 ( above ) , the mannequin - like aliens from dr who			1

six child bollards have been put outside @entity15 in @entity16
intended to fool drivers into thinking a child is about to cross the road
it is hoped this will make speeding drivers ease off the accelerator
the £ 230,000 scheme has been running in @entity16 since 2009
