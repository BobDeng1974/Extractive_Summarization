@entity1 ’s timeless princesses and villains have captured the imagination of millions across the world			1
but what would they look like if their exaggerated features were translated into real - life anatomy ? @entity10 artist @entity9 , who works under the name ‘ @entity12 ’ , attempted to find out in this series of portraits			1
from top left to right , then next rows : @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , prince @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , the evil queen , @entity45 , prince @entity46 , @entity47 ms @entity9 said she manipulated each photo until she got ‘ the right features and made them real enough looking			1
’ she admitted to having some difficulty with ‘ ridiculously proportioned @entity1 characters ’ such as @entity41 and @entity39			1
the results , however , are surprisingly realistic and show just what a real - life @entity28 or @entity27 might look like if you bumped into them on the street			0
these portraits were designed by @entity10 artist @entity9			0
below each portrait is the original character created by @entity1			0
from top left clockwise : prince @entity37 from @entity63 , @entity38 also from @entity63 , @entity39 from 101 @entity64 , @entity40 from @entity41 , @entity47 , prince @entity46 and @entity45 from the @entity65 from top left clockwise : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 ( all from the @entity67 ) @entity68 from @entity35 and @entity30 and @entity29 from @entity69 from top left clockwise : @entity32 , @entity33 from @entity71 , @entity34 from @entity35 , @entity42 , @entity41 and @entity40 from @entity41 from top left clockwise : @entity17 , @entity18 from @entity17 , @entity73 also from @entity17 , @entity26 , @entity25 from @entity26 and @entity24 from @entity74 despite these real - life representations , @entity1 's unrealistic proportions have repeatedly come under fire			1
only last month , @entity78 , a sociologist at the @entity79 found that @entity1 tends to animate its typically - thin female protagonists even thinner when they are portrayed as the subject of romantic attention			1
in looking at seven studies that survey average wrist sizes , mr @entity78 found ‘ a range for women of 15.4 cm to 16.3 cm and for men of 17.5 cm to 18.1 cm ’			2
a survey of @entity90 members discovered that the average ratio of men ’s to women ’s wrist sizes weigh in at just 1.15 - to - 1			0
that correlation is not accurately depicted in @entity1 ’s animations , he says			0
@entity97 is n’t the only one who has attempted to bring @entity1 ’s magic to life			0
@entity102 - based photographer @entity101 has also created incredible real - life versions of @entity1 princesses - and the likenesses are uncanny			2
mr @entity101 ’s project , named ' the @entity107 ' , involved shooting real - life versions of his favourite @entity1 princesses one - by - one			2
what is essential for the success of his work , he said , was a ' great costume , and a great model			0
' despite these real - life representations , @entity1 's unrealistic character proportions have repeatedly come under fire			2
only last month , @entity78 , a sociologist at the @entity79 found that @entity1 tends to animate its typically - thin female protagonists even thinner when they are portrayed as the subject of romantic attention			1
‘ i think the evidence suggests that @entity1 favours compositions in which women ’s hands are tiny compared to men ’s , especially when they are in romantic relationships , ’ he said			1
in @entity132 , for instance , main character @entity129 wrists appear to be almost one third the size of @entity136 ’s , her male love interest			0
@entity102 - based photographer @entity101 has also created incredible real - life versions of @entity1 princesses , such as this one of @entity34 from @entity35 @entity43 's beauty is reflected in the real princess 's rosebud lips and peaches and cream complexion @entity1 's unrealistic proportions have repeatedly come under fire			2
for instance , @entity145 , the protagonist of @entity132 , has wrists that are smaller than her eyes			0

images show how exaggerated @entity1 features would look on real *people*
