two - year - old @entity8 suffered brain damage when she was born , leaving her partially blind and deaf , and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy			1
from just two days old she started having up to 60 uncontrollable seizures a day - some lasting more than an hour			1
doctors tried almost everything to stop the convulsions - which they warned would soon stop her brain from growing - and even considered brain surgery			2
@entity19 and her partner @entity20 give their two - year - old daughter @entity21 , second left , daily doses of cannabis claiming the drug helps ease her seizures two - year - old @entity21 , suffered brain damage when she was born , leaving her partially blind and deaf , and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy but when nothing worked her parents @entity19 and @entity20 discovered that a daily dose of liquid cannabis had helped other children like @entity21			1
they found a man on the internet who grows the plant for the sole purpose of helping poorly people and within just a day of trying it @entity21 was having just five seizures a day			1
miss @entity19 , 22 , said : ' people tell me i ’m a terrible mother and they say things like " you would n’t give your daughter heroin "			1
' but little do they realise , most of the medicines the doctors gave us before had opium in - the same plant heroin is derived from			0
' i ’m not a bad mother , i want nothing but good for my child			1
' she was in pain , she was suffering , and i tried everything before i tried this			0
' sadly , my miracle treatment is illegal and in administering it to my daughter three times a day , i ’m breaking the law			2
' @entity64 was born in @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , suffering from diabetes and with her cord wrapped round her neck			2
her mother claims it left her with feeding problems , causing a low blood sugar , leading to seizures which further damaged her brain and caused more convulsions and epilepsy			1
doctors tried countless anti-convulsant treatments but none worked and many had terrible side effects including painful rashes , breathing problems and a soaring heart rate			0
some conventional treatments made her lose her appetite all together while others made her gain so much weight her devastated parents found it hard to lift her			0
@entity21 used to suffer up to 60 seizures a day , but her mother claims since giving the toddler doses of cannabis she now suffers five fits a day miss @entity19 said : ' i 'm not a bad mother , i want nothing but good for my child			1
she was in pain , she was suffering , and i tried everything before i tried this ' the use of medical marijuana and pure cannabidiol - an active substance in the cannabis plant - for neurologic conditions is controversial			2
@entity111 , or @entity111 , has medicinal properties , but does not provide the ' high ' associated with the drug			0
it is thought the cbd quiets the excessive electrical and chemical activity in the brain that causes seizures			2
@entity118 carried out at @entity119 in the @entity120 discusses a child with a severe form of epilepsy given cannabis in conjunction with anti-epileptic medication			2
the child went from suffering 50 convulsions a day to around night - time convulsions per month , doctors say			1

it is also used to alleviate nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients			0
mother - of - two miss @entity19 , said : ' prescribed drugs made her blood vessels swell and burst in her face			1
' her throat swelled and she needed a feeding tube			0
it felt hopeless - all these horrible drugs and side effects , yet still 60 horrific seizures a day			2
' it was very difficult			0
you just want to take your new baby home and enjoy them , but we could n’t do that			0
' but while researching other options , @entity21 ’s father mr rule , a painter and decorator , heard other children like @entity21 had been helped by marijuana			1
full - time carer @entity167 asked her doctors about medical cannabis but after they laughed at her she took to the internet to find a supplier on the internet			2
now a man called @entity20 sends them 250ml of cannabis tincture a month - a liquid made by soaking the cannabis flowers , leaves , or stems in ethyl alcohol to create a medicine			1
he does not charge for the medicine - which @entity21 has been taking in her bottles since december - and only supplies to the parents of poorly children			2
miss @entity19 said : ' we ’d watch helplessly as she suffered up to 60 seizures a day , some lasting as long as an hour			1
@entity64 was born in @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , suffering from diabetes and with her cord wrapped round her neck			2
her parents have to give her a host of medicines , right , each day ' but the first day @entity21 had the cannabis tincture , she went from 60 seizures to five , and they only lasted one minute			1
' she was more alert , she could move about , she had an appetite			0
' the difference is it has given her a life which she never had			0
she is awake more , we ’ve got her off the opiate medication , and we have had to go to hospital since we tried it			0
' she also has n’t suffered any more brain damage			1
' but her ' dealer ' has been charged with cultivating and growing marijuana and is due in court next month , where he could be given a prison sentence			0
desperate miss @entity19 faces having to find another way to get the medicine for her daughter - or watch her go back to having 60 seizures a day			1
' without him , there are 200 families like us who will be without our medicine , ' she said			0
' i do n’t know what we ’ll do if he goes to prison			0
' if we ca n’t keep accessing cannabis tincture it means that @entity21 ’s seizures will kill her			1
' giving our daughter marijuana is the best option			0
it ’s our only hope			0

@entity8 suffered brain damage when she was born , leaving her partially blind and deaf , and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy
from the age of two days old she started suffering 60 seizures a day
doctors prescribed a range of medications , which her parents @entity19 and @entity20 have to give their daughter each day
researching @entity21 *'s* *symptoms* online , mr @entity20 discovered a daily dose of liquid cannabis was an alternative therapy
the couple risk prison to give their daughter the drug , which they claim has reduced her fits to five a day
