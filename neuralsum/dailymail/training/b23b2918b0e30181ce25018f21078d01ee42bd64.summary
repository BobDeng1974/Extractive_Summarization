manager @entity0 is excited by the prospect of @entity2 having @entity3 and @entity4 both fit and firing on the field at the same time			1
following his summer arrival from @entity8 on a season - long loan deal , winger moses established himself as the @entity11 ' star performer in the early weeks of the campaign before he was sidelined by a thigh injury sustained towards the end of november			1
it was at that point that forward @entity4 - a summer signing on a permanent deal from @entity18 - was just beginning to really show what he can do in a @entity2 shirt , and he has subsequently emerged as their key attacking player in @entity3 ' absence			1
@entity4 ( right ) has been in impressive form for @entity2 in recent weeks in his first season in @entity25 @entity3 has n't featured for @entity2 since november 's @entity27 defeat by @entity28 @entity3 made his return to the matchday squad as an unused substitute when the @entity33 outfit suffered a 3 - 0 @entity27 defeat at @entity35 last weekend , and he looks set for his playing comeback in saturday 's top - flight trip to @entity38			1
and @entity0 said of the @entity40 international : ' he is very much in my thoughts for the weekend and hopefully , if he does play , he will be able to hit the performance levels that he was reaching prior to the injury , because he was arguably our best player			2
' @entity46 had come into the team around the same time and took over that mantle , leading from the front with his level of performances			0
' if we can get them both firing at the same time , then we should be in good shape			0
' the @entity40 international , on loan from @entity8 , injured his thigh and has n't featured since the former @entity18 forward has been one of @entity2 's biggest attacking threats in @entity3 's absence @entity2 full - back @entity60 is a doubt but midfielder @entity63 should be available for saturday 's contest after both came off at half - time with groin complaints during the @entity35 match			1
frontman @entity69 remains on @entity71 duty with @entity72			0
@entity0 ' 11th - placed side take on a @entity38 outfit who are bottom of the table			2
the foxes were in that position on christmas day , and there have only been two seasons in @entity27 history where the side in that predicament have gone on to avoid relegation			0
@entity0 sees it as a ' tough call ' as to whether or not @entity88 's men - currently three points adrift of safety - will be able to beat the drop			0
manager @entity0 is excited about the prospect of @entity4 and @entity3 teaming up in the @entity2 attack but he has no doubt they will face @entity2 in buoyant mood after defeating @entity97 and @entity98 either side of drawing at @entity100 in their last three league games			1
' it is a tough call - historically it is difficult to stay up when you have been bottom at @entity106 , ' said @entity0 , whose team were beaten at home by @entity38 in september			2
' but it has been done in the past , and they will be encouraged by virtue of their last few games , when they have gone up against good teams and given a good account of themselves and , more importantly , picked up points			0
' meanwhile , @entity0 has played down the suggestion that talks over a new @entity2 contract for midfielder @entity121 - currently on a deal that runs out this summer - have broken down			2
' there needs to be further discussions , but we are hopeful something will be resolved very quickly , ' @entity0 said .			0
