@entity0 on friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out @entity2 sensationally over-turned on appeal , following an outcry on his behalf			1
the @entity6 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘ reckless ’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the @entity11 , as he scored a try for @entity13 on march 27			1
@entity0 was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded			0
although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the @entity18 - born player with @entity20 ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing			0
yet , in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by @entity6 was up - held			1
@entity0 's knee collided with @entity2 's head as he crossed the line to score for @entity13 @entity34 was left out cold on the pitch at @entity36 and had to be taken off on a stretcher it was the third time that the @entity40 and @entity41 winger had been knocked out in the space of two months @entity18 - born forward @entity0 missed his side 's @entity44 quarter - final loss against @entity46 last sunday @entity34 was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months			1
he has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms			2
@entity52 , slow - motion footage of the incident at @entity36 led some observers to condemn @entity0 , but many more spoke up in his defence			2
wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club			0
captain @entity62 said : ‘ astounded would be an under - statement ’ , while fly - half @entity64 added : ‘ really ca n’t believe or understand the ban for @entity0			2
there was no intent and i feel the accident has been judged on outcome			0
’ former @entity20 player @entity71 branded the sentence a ‘ total joke ’ and @entity75 captain @entity74 echoed his sentiment , calling it an ‘ absolute joke ’			0
@entity0 was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on march 27 @entity0 missed his club ’s @entity44 defeat to holders @entity46 last sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing			1
he is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match - day squad for @entity6 ’ @entity85 trip to @entity86 tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of @entity91 to @entity92 on april 26			1
@entity93 , chairman of the appeal hearing panel , said : ‘ the appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh			0
having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel , it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally			0
