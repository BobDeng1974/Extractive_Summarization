the immigration boom under @entity3 led to the face of @entity5 changing faster than any major nation except @entity7 , a study by an @entity1 think tank revealed			1
during the five - year peak of the influx , the @entity5 ’s migrant population soared by 22 per cent – double the average of @entity14 countries , figures from the @entity17 show			1
over the past two decades , @entity5 ’s foreign - born population has increased from 3.8million – or 7 per cent of the total population - in 1993 to almost 7million , or 12 per cent per cent in 2010			1
changing faces : @entity5 has become increasingly multicultural in the past two decades			0
the number of immigrants in the country rose by 22 % in five peak years between 2000 and 2005 during the same period , the number of foreign - born residents without @entity5 citizenship doubled from just under two million ( 4 per cent of the population ) to over four million ( 7 per cent )			1
net - migration – the number arrivals minus those leaving - increased from 564,000 during the five years from 1996 - 2000 , to 923,000 in 2001 - 2005 and 1,044,000 during 2006 - 2010			0
in 2010 , net - migration reached 252,000 , its highest level for a single calendar year on record			0
but it is the period between 2000 and 2005 – a period of an open border policy during and rapid expansion of the @entity37 - that immigration really spiked			1
leap : the graph shows migration soared by 22 % in @entity5 between 2000 and 2005			1
only @entity7 saw its foreign - born population rise faster ( 44.6 % )			1
@entity43 's rose only by 3.2 % during the same period ahead : @entity5 's immigrant growth rate has remained above the averages of the original 15 @entity37 member states , the @entity14 group of major industrial nations and the world for most of the last decade only @entity7 , which experienced a 44.6 per cent rise in immigration , saw a higher rate in the developed world			1
but , after more restrictions were introduced in 2005 , the growth rate of the migrant population in the @entity5 was just over 10 per cent			0
it was still higher than the @entity14 average – but somewhat lower than 14 per cent rate of the 15 @entity37 countries that existed prior to 2004			0
this group – with 21.4 per cent rise - had only a slightly lower level of immigration growth that the @entity5 between 2000 and 2005			2
queues : people in lines for @entity69 holders at @entity70			0
relaxed immigration rules and an expansion of the @entity37 mean that the number of people entitled to live in the @entity5 has rocketed over the last two decades although , experts believe @entity7 ’s enormous spike has skewed these figures			1
criticism : @entity78 , from @entity79 , said @entity80 is ' simply wrong ' about @entity5 workers for example , @entity43 saw only a 3.4 per cent rise in immigration during the period , according to data obtained by the @entity87			2
@entity89 's immigration growth rose only by 1.6 per cent			0
figures also show that as the global population has increased considerably in the last two decades , so too has the number of international migrants			2
the number has increased from 156million in 1990 to 214million in 2010			0
the comparison with @entity14 countries compares other high - income nations this group , which also includes @entity89 , @entity7 , @entity43 , @entity99 , the @entity101 @entity100 and @entity102			2
for all the @entity14 countries , with the exception of @entity102 , migrants are defined as foreign - born residents in the data			1
in the data for @entity102 , migrants are defined as foreign citizens			0
@entity78 , of pressure group @entity79 , told @entity109 : ‘ this underlines what we have been saying about @entity3 ’s mass immigration policy			2
‘ it also shows why it will be so difficult to get immigration back down to sensible levels ’			0

immigrant population soared by 22 % during @entity3 's open door policy
during past two decades number of foreign - born residents has doubled
only @entity7 - with rise of 44.6 % over same period - recorded *bigger* rise
*watchdogs* say figures show why it will be hard to reduce immigration
