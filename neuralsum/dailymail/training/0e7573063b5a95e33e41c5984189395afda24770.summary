the sex case against former @entity2 chief @entity1 was on the verge of collapse last night after four prostitutes dropped their accusations against him			1
all were main prosecution witnesses in the trial in @entity9 , northern @entity10 , in which the 65 - year - old is accused of aggravated pimping			1
if he is acquitted , it will be yet another remarkable legal escape for the notorious philanderer who has been accused of a series of sex crimes			0
the women in the latest case had provided days of sordid testimony in which the man known as @entity1 was portrayed as a ruthless sexual predator			1
i solemnly swear : the aggravated pimping case against former @entity2 chief @entity1 may be over after four main witnesses , all prostitutes , have dropped their civil complaints many said they had been powerless to stop him subjecting them to painful sex acts performed at orgies around the world			1
one said she had seen @entity1 being ‘ entertained ’ by up to eight prostitutes during a single sex session in a @entity38 hotel			2
but court officials yesterday said the four women had dropped their complaint , along with a women ’s rights group that was supporting them			0
‘ all consider there is not enough evidence to brand mr @entity1 a pimp , ’ said one court source			2
this means that just one other organisation called @entity49 , which campaigns on behalf of those forced into prostitution , is now officially complaining against @entity1 and 13 other defendants			0
‘ it does not mean that the trial is over , but clearly mr @entity1 ’s defence is now in a very strong position , ’ said another source			2
@entity1 , who was once considered a shoo - in to become @entity59 president of @entity10 , spent three days in the dock last week			0
easy way out : former @entity2 chief @entity1 enters his car after leaving his hotel in @entity9 today to attend a session on the third week of the so - called ' @entity66 ' trial he particularly objected to a claim by one woman who said she cried and gestured that she did not want to perform a certain sex act with him , but that he smiled and went ahead anyway			1
‘ it ’s not my concept of sexuality to do it with a prostitute , ’ @entity1 said , adding that he preferred the ‘ party atmosphere ’ of partner - swapping and swinging			0
@entity1 said that despite the idea given in court papers of ‘ frenetic activity ’ , the orgies were organised four times a year because he had been very busy ‘ saving the world from catastrophe ’ at the time of the financial crisis			0
@entity1 is accused of aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women between 2009 and 2011			2
he and 13 other defendants deny charges of pimping			0
despite a number of previous high - profile accusations against him , including being arrested on suspicion of the attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid in @entity96 , the @entity9 case is the first time that @entity1 has faced trial			1
he faces up to ten years in prison and a fine of more than £ 1million if found guilty at the end of proceedings later this week			0
protest : a topless @entity104 protester climbs on top of the car carrying former @entity2 chief @entity1 to court last week			1

main witnesses in trial of @entity1 dropped complaints
loss of the four prostitutes may see the case against @entity1 collapse
the former @entity2 chief has been accused of aggravated pimping
