workers are to be offered tax - free shares to surrender employment rights , @entity0 revealed yesterday			1
under the chancellor 's plan , employees will receive as little as £ 2,000 when they agree not to sue their employers if they are mistreated or unfairly dismissed			1
workers will also be required to give up their right to time off for training purposes , give longer notice if they intend to return to their jobs after parental leave and lose their redundancy protections			1
business leaders hailed the proposal as a key step towards a more dynamic and flexible workforce , and the chancellor ’s aides predicted hundreds of thousands of employees would take up the offer			0
but it infuriated union leaders , who accused the government of chiselling away at employment rights and insisted few workers would be interested			1
under the scheme , ‘ employee - owners ’ will be given between £ 2,000 and £ 50,000 of shares by their firms that will be exempt from capital gains tax when sold			1
in return , they will agree to give up their right to claim unfair dismissal , redundancy pay , the right to request flexible working or time off for training and will have to give twice as much notice of intent to return from parental leave			1
legislation to bring in the new optional contract will be introduced later this year and be put into law in time for companies to use it from april next year			0
announcing the policy to the @entity21 conference in @entity33 , mr @entity0 said it would appeal to new businesses starting up and small and medium - sized firms who need flexible labour and highly - motivated staff			1
in a sombre speech , the chancellor insisted he would not be diverted from his plans to cut the deficit , despite the double dip recession			0
mr @entity0 was joined by his wife @entity89 to walk back over the bridge to the @entity91 after his speech former minister : @entity21 grandee @entity94 at the @entity21 the share option plan unveiled yesterday combines @entity21 demands for less business red tape and a @entity99 policy to encourage more employee - ownership			1
staff would be offered £ 2,000 to £ 50,000 of which would be exempt from any capital gains tax			2
they would then give up their rights to claim unfair dismissal , statutory redundancy pay , requesting flexible working and asking for longer parental leave			2
employee - owner shares would be optional for existing staff but it could be compulsory for new hires or start - up firms			1
legislation will be fast - tracked so the changes can come into force from april 2013			2
the scheme could cost £ 100m in 2017 - 18			1
government sources said they expected take up to be highest among fast - growing small and mid-sized businesses			2
mr @entity0 said : ' get shares and become owners of the company you work for			1
owners , workers , and the taxman , all in it together			2
' he insisted he would not repeat the mistakes of @entity130 in 1972 , who ‘ two years into office was faced with economic problems and over powerful unions buckled and gave up ’			0
he attempted to woo the ‘ strivers ’ who handed @entity138 three election victories , saying the party represented ‘ all those who aspire , all who work , save and hope , all who feel a responsibility to put in , not just take out ’			0
‘ whether it ’s the owner of the corner shop staying open until midnight to support their family , or the teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the after - school club , ’ the chancellor added			0
or the commuter who leaves home before the children are up , and comes back long after they have gone to bed , because they want a better life for them			0
or the pensioner , who has saved all their life , and does n’t want to spend it all as they want to pass something on to their children			0
‘ or the entrepreneur who does n’t cash out and pack up , but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story			0
‘ they are all part of one nation – one nation working together to get on			0
that is the nation we represent			0
’ mr @entity0 won big cheers as he flatly rejected @entity99 demands for a ‘ mansion tax ’ on expensive properties – warning that ‘ once the tax inspector had his foot in the door you ’d soon find most homes in the country labelled a “ mansion ” , homes people have worked hard to afford and already paid taxes on ’			1
‘ it ’s not a mansion tax , it ’s homes tax and this party of home ownership will have no truck with it , ’ he declared			0
but he said those at the ‘ very top ’ would have to pay more towards the deficit reduction programme , as long as it could be done without ‘ damaging the enterprise economy ’			0
he told delegates ‘ the economy is healing ’ but warned that ‘ healing is taking longer than we hoped because the damage was greater than we feared ’			0
the chancellor announced that as austerity measures continue into the next @entity211 , he will continue the current split of 80 per cent of the effort coming from reduced spending and 20 per cent from taxes			0
prime minister @entity216 applauds as chancellor @entity0 addresses the @entity21 party conference the chancellor 's speech was well - received in @entity220 in @entity33 he confirmed plans to slash a further £ 10billion from the welfare budget – proposing removing housing benefit from the young unemployed and limits on handouts to jobless parents who insist on having more children , without being able to afford them			1
@entity0 suffered a setback last night as the @entity229 said it now expects the @entity231 economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year – far worse than the growth of 0.2 per cent it predicted in july			2
it also downgraded its 2013 growth forecast from 1.4 per cent to 1.1 per cent – little more than half the 2 per cent expected by the @entity236 in another blow to the chancellor			0
but there was better news from the @entity241 which said the @entity231 economy is picking up even as the eurozone plunges deeper into crisis			0
mr @entity0 also suggested that some of the cuts would come from freezing benefits			1
he said : ‘ how can we justify the incomes of those out - of - work rising faster than the incomes of those in work ? ’ attacking @entity34 ’s demands for more debt - fuelled public spending , he said : ‘ our critics gamble everything : our credibility , our financial stability , our low interest rates , the cost of our debt – they would risk everything on the dubious idea that a few billion more of spending would dramatically improve the fortunes of a trillion and a half - pound @entity231 economy			1
’ unveiling his employee - ownership scheme , he described it as a ‘ three way deal ’			1
‘ you the company : give your employees shares in the business			2
you the employee : replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership , ’ he said			2
‘ and what will the government do ? we ’ll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your shares			2
zero per cent capital gains tax for these new employee - owners			1
‘ get shares and become owners of the company you work for			2
owners , workers , and the taxman , all in it together			0
workers of the world , unite			0
’ the chancellor waved briefly at the end of his speech before quickly leaving the stage @entity21 mp @entity303 shared a jokes with @entity216 on the way to mr @entity0 's speech			1
