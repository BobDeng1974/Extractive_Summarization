by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 10:48 est , 26 july 2012 @entity3 @entity2 presidential candidate and former @entity5 governor @entity4 is due to visit @entity6 this week senior @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity11 mps are urging @entity12 contender @entity4 to support changes to the hugely controversial @entity6 / @entity14 during his visit to @entity6			1
in an open letter to mr @entity4 , they urge him to back calls for @entity6 and @entity3 citizens to be afforded the same legal protection			1
currently , @entity3 enjoy legal rights which are not available to @entity6 such as @entity22 , who the @entity3 is seeking to extradite for hacking into military computers while searching for evidence of little green men			1
the letter , signed by @entity7 backbencher @entity27 , @entity29 leader sir @entity28 and the @entity11 chairman of the home affairs select committee , @entity33 , says changing the extradition rules would help to strengthen relations between the two countries			1
it says : ‘ one issue which is controversial is the question of our extradition relations , which have generated widespread public and @entity43 concern			0
‘ in december , the @entity45 unanimously voted for reform of @entity6 extradition laws , including the arrangements under the @entity3 - @entity6 treaty			1
as a result , in march at the @entity51 , president @entity44 agreed to prime minister @entity53 's request for a review of those arrangements			0
‘ if you are president , would you be willing to do the same ? ‘ all we ask is that the same evidential procedure is applied in @entity6 courts as @entity3 courts for deciding whether our citizens should be extradited , and that a forum test is introduced so that , in cross-border cases , our respective courts can decide where the case should be tried bearing in mind all the relevant interests of justice			1
‘ would you be willing to look sympathetically at such changes ? they would be enormously appreciated by those in my country who want to see the special relationship go from strength to strength			0
he is pictured , right , with @entity53 during a visit to @entity82 last month it emerged how seven times more @entity6 citizens have been sent to the @entity3 under the lopsided act than there have been @entity3 sent in the opposite direction			1
@entity90 figures revealed how the hugely controversial treaty is being used by the @entity3 authorities far more often than their @entity6 counterparts			1
since 2004 , 99 people have been extradited from the @entity6 to the @entity3			1
yet only 44 people have been extradited from the @entity3 to the @entity6 – fewer than half as many			2
@entity7 backbencher @entity27 , pictured left , and the @entity11 chairman of the home affairs select committee mp @entity33 , pictured right , both signed the letter addressed to mr @entity4 when the figures are broken down by nationality , the picture is even more stark			0
@entity22 , pictured , faces being hauled to the @entity3 for crimes committed from the bedroom of his north @entity107 home some 35 @entity6 nationals have been extradited from the @entity6 to the @entity3			2
but as few as 5 @entity3 citizens have been extradited from the @entity3 to the @entity6			2
@entity6 has extradited more of its nationals to the @entity3 in the last six months – seven - than the @entity3 has sent its nationals to the @entity6 in the last five years , according to data unearthed by mr @entity27			2
the figures will heighten demands for changes to the @entity14 , which was passed by @entity11 in 2003 , and is currently under review by the home secretary			0
critics say it is biased against @entity6 nationals			0
@entity6 must provide the @entity3 authorities with ‘ such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested			1
this is known as the ‘ probable cause ’ test – and means that @entity3 citizens have the right to a court hearing to examine the evidence against them			0
however , if the @entity3 want to extradite a @entity6 citizen , they need only to outline the alleged offence , the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought			2
the most high - profile victim of the @entity14 is mr @entity22 , 46 , who faces being hauled to the @entity3 for crimes committed from the bedroom of his north @entity107 home			0
he hacked into @entity144 and @entity145 computers while looking for evidence of the existence of ‘ little green men ’ medical experts say he is likely to take his own life if extradited			0
