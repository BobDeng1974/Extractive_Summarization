by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 12 july 2013 crews removing @entity3 's plane wreckage early friday morning encountered smoke coming from the aircraft 's main body which had held passengers			1
the smoke was captured by @entity10 cameras , and the news station said it occurred moments after crews used a sling to lift the fuselage			1
it appears that the wreckage has since been removed			2
@entity21 officials hope to re-open the runway by sunday			1
the closure has led to flight cancellations and delays			2
meanwhile , nearly a week after @entity3 collided with the rocky seawall just short of its intended airport runway , details of the crash that killed two people have emerged , citing airspeed as a major contributor			1
' the first thing that 's taught to a pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator			1
it is the most important instrument in the cockpit , ' said @entity46 , a pilot with 29 years and 18,000 hours experience flying a variety of airliners			2
you have airspeed , you live			2
you do n't , you die			2
' the @entity3 pilots were supposed to be closely monitoring the plane 's airspeed , but did n't realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and slow			1
nothing disclosed so far by the @entity60 investigators indicates any problems with the @entity63 's engines or the functioning of its computers and automated systems			1
investigators are still trying to nail down hundreds of details about the crash last saturday that killed two people ( aircraft seen being hauled to a hanger ) investigators are still trying to nail down hundreds of details about the crash last saturday that killed two people and injured dozens			1
@entity60 chairman @entity76 has cautioned against reaching conclusions			2
but investigators already know a great deal			2
they 've listened to the @entity63 's voice recorder , which captured the last two hours of conversation in the cockpit			1
they 've downloaded its flight data recorder , which captured 1,400 indicators of what was happening on the plane , from the temperatures inside and out to the positions of cockpit instruments			2
the flight 's four pilots have been interviewed , as have passengers and dozens of witnesses			1
air traffic control recordings and video of the flight 's last moments , including the crash itself , have been examined			1
here 's what investigators have revealed about a @entity104 - to - @entity21 flight that was normal until its last minutes , when the wide - body jet carrying 307 people rapidly lost altitude : the pilot flying the plane , @entity110 , 46 , had nearly 10,000 hours of flying experience , but just 35 hours flying a @entity63 777			1
@entity3 is dismantled and hauled to a hangar after it was revealed that the pilots were flying the aircraft too slow at the time of landing workers began clearing the wreckage early friday morning - nearly a week after the runway crash in @entity21 he had recently completed training that qualified him to fly passengers in the 777 , and was about halfway through his post-qualification training			1
he was seated in the left cockpit pilot seat			2
in the co-pilot position was @entity126 , an experienced captain who was supervising @entity110 's training			1
it was @entity110 's first time landing a 777 in @entity21			1
at 11:19:23 pdt , after a nearly 11 - hour flight , the plane was traveling over the @entity132			2
the weather was near perfect , sunny with light winds			2
@entity126 and a third pilot sitting in a jump seat just behind the main seats , a first officer , were supposed to be monitoring the plane 's controls			1
one of their most important jobs was to closely monitor the plane 's two airspeed indicators			1
in the @entity150 , if an amber bar is more than five knots above or below the target speed during landing , the pilot flying is supposed to abort and make another attempt , according to pilots interviewed by @entity0			0
as the plane descended to 1,600 feet , the autopilot was turned off			0
at 1,400 feet , the plane 's airspeed was about 170 knots			1
the flight data recorder shows the plane 's autothrottle — similar to a car 's cruise control — was set on idle during the approach , @entity76 said , and that there were multiple commands at times given to the autothrottle and autopilot			1
at 11:26:58 and 1,000 feet , the pilots made contact with the airport tower			0
when they were cleared to land 12 seconds later , the plane 's altitude had dropped to about 600 feet			1
the plane was configured for its approach and the landing gear was down			0
the airspeed was about 149 knots			0
a target speed of 137 knots was set			0
heavy equipment sits next to the wreckage of @entity3 at @entity21 days after the crash @entity60 workers seen near the @entity63 @entity3 aircraft just one day after the crash in @entity188 at 500 feet there was an audible automated altitude alert			1
the airspeed was about 134 knots			0
at this point that pilots realized they were n't properly lined up with the runway , @entity76 said			1
' between 500 and 200 feet , they had a lateral deviation and they were low			0
they were trying to correct at that point , ' she said			0
at 200 feet and another automated altitude call out , the airspeed had slowed to 118 knots — well below the target level			0
at this point , @entity150 pilots would typically call for an aborted landing because the plane was more than 5 knots below its target speed , @entity46 said			0
but at no point in between 500 and 100 feet does the voice recorder show the pilots making any comment related to airspeed , @entity76 said at a briefing thursday			0
@entity76 said at earlier briefings that it was not until 200 feet — 16 seconds before impact — that @entity126 , the instructor pilot ' recognized the auto - throttles were not maintaining speed			0
' at 125 feet and 112 knots , both throttles started moving forward , indicating more fuel was being sent to the engines to increase power and speed			0
that was eight seconds before impact			0
even if the autothrottles were n't fully turned on , either of the pilots in the two front seats could reach down and manually push the throttle levers forward to increase power			0
passengers from @entity3 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the @entity21 it was about this time that the cockpit voice recorder indicated the first officer — the third pilot seating behind the front two pilots — realized the plane was traveling too slowly and called for an increase in speed			1
a second later , @entity110 's yoke can be heard rattling violently on the voice recorder			1
this is the sound of a stick shaker going off , a piece of safety equipment that tells a pilot the plane is about to stall because it has slowed to a dangerous speed and lost lift			1
when the pilots in the two front seats realized the plane was in trouble , they both reached for the throttle			0
passengers heard a loud roar as the plane revved up in a last - minute attempt to abort the landing			0
at three seconds before impact , the plane reached its slowest speed of 103 knots			0
its engines were at 50 percent power and power was increasing			0
at this time , one of the pilots called for an aborted landing			0
at one and a half seconds before impact , another of the pilots calls for an aborted landing			0
at 11:28 , with the airspeed up three knots , the landing gear , followed by the plane 's tail , collided with the seawall just short of @entity279			1
the plane careened wildly before slamming down onto the tarmac and sliding about 1,000 feet			0
the tail was sheared off and three flight attendants seated in the back of the plane fell out			0
rocks from the seawall and pieces of the mangled landing gear were strewn along the runway			2
the @entity60 's investigation is being followed closely by pilots in the @entity150 and around the world			2
at one gathering of pilots in @entity296 wednesday night , the discussion centered on why the @entity298 pilots did n't realize their low speed sooner			0
no one had an answer			0
' there are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now , ' @entity46 said .			0

@entity307 came from the aircraft 's main body after crews used a sling to lift the fuselage
