a 73 - year - old @entity1 drama teacher who appeared in some softcore budget films over 40 years ago - one called @entity3 - has been fired from her position at the elite private school after some students traced back her racy roles			1
@entity8 says she briefly worked as a young erotic actress in @entity10 - appearing in titles like @entity12 and @entity13 : escape from @entity15 , but nothing pornographic - in the 1970s before returning to her native @entity17			1
she continued a career in tv and film before settling as a teacher , having taught at the prestigious private school @entity24 for the last 15 years , according to @entity25			1
however @entity26 is now out of a job after some male students tracked down some of her work online , presumably by accessing her @entity32 page			1
' the fact these films were made 40 years ago does not change their risqué , suggestive — explicit even — nature , ' the school told @entity25			2
' thanks to the @entity72 , it appears these types of films from the 1970s have come back in fashion			2
' as educators , we had to ask what message is transmitted to all our students , boys and girls , from the first year of high school to the fifth , by the fact that the teacher of their drama workshops could now be seen on the internet in the most suggestive of scenes			2
' @entity24 is considered the best school in @entity17			1
however @entity26 thinks the move is outrageous			0
she believes , as an elderly woman , the decisions she made in her twenties should not have any great leaning on her life			0
' it ’s completely absurd , ' she told @entity100			0
' i ’m 73 years old			0
elite : @entity24 is considered the best boys school in @entity17 ' when i made those films i must have been 28 or 29			1
' it was to make a living so that after ( wards ) i could work with great teachers and actors , in @entity10 and in @entity17			2
' ' it is too bad ( the principal ) said something so stupid , that i was distracting ( the students )			0
' they should have been made to understand what was the cinema of that period			0
' @entity26 said the films reflect what was happening in cinema at the time and are not considered pornographic but just ' open - minded '			1
an online petition has been start in order to get @entity26 her job back			0
there were reports late wednesday @entity26 had been talking with the school about a new outcome .			0
