by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 16 february 2013 the closure of four major @entity3 units is set to be approved this week , forcing hundreds of thousands of seriously ill patients to travel further for emergency care			1
the units across @entity7 will be scrapped and replaced by @entity8 once the proposals are formally approved at a board meeting of @entity12 officials on tuesday			2
there has been huge opposition from doctors and patients during a public consultation period , and campaigners argue that residents in some of the most deprived areas of the capital will be put at risk			1
@entity22 in @entity7 is one of the four to be losing its @entity3 department @entity26 's @entity3 department is being downgraded to an @entity27 the downgraded departments will be prevented from treating a huge array of life - threatening illnesses , such as shock , internal bleeding , most broken bones , breathing problems , heart attacks and strokes			1
the @entity37 earmarked for closure are at @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity22 hospitals			1
just four major hospitals with fully functioning casualty wards will remain , serving 1.9 million people			1
it is estimated that each of the remaining a&es , which are already struggling to cope , will see attendances rise by 50 per cent			2
the closure recommendations are contained in papers for tuesday ’s board meeting of @entity53			2
@entity3 departments at @entity41 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) face closures in preference of @entity8 however , there is evidence that the @entity59 already in place in the area – which are being run by private providers – are seriously failing patients			1
responses to @entity66 requests reveal that one confused patient attending @entity68 ’s @entity8 in february last year had his emergency treatment delayed by four hours after locum staff did not realise how ill he was			0
and in a data protection breach , confidential medical notes for six children treated at the @entity8 , which were intended for their gps , were sent to the wrong fax number			0
@entity76 , chairman of the @entity78 campaign in @entity39 , said : ‘ it does confirm our worst fears that they have closed the four a&es they wanted to close in the first place , and it ’s become even more clear that the main rationale for this is to sell off land for residential development			0
all this comes in the face of massive opposition			0
’ a statement from the consultants ’ group at @entity68 said : ‘ we , as frontline consultants , do not feel comfortable with the speed at which changes are being made , the great loss of capacity for inpatient beds in @entity7 , and lengthening @entity3 queues			0
‘ overwhelmingly it seems difficult to appreciate how these changes are anything other than financially driven			0
’ @entity105 has suggested it could seek a judicial review if @entity68 ’s @entity3 department is closed			0
but dr @entity108 , medical director of @entity53 , said : ‘ i have no doubts at all that the care we will be providing will be better than it is currently			2

departments downgraded to no *longer* treat heart attack or stroke patients
four *nearby* @entity37 will stretch to care for nearly two million people
