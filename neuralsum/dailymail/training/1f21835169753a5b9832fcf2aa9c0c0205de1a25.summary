by @entity0 adults can reverse the negative effects of heart disease by dropping unhealthy habits in their 30s and 40s , scientists claim			1
a new study suggests that eating a healthier diet and doing more exercise can control and potentially even reverse the natural progression of coronary artery disease			2
but the researchers warned that picking up extra bad habits as you get older will have a detrimental impact on your arteries			1
a new study suggests that if people make healthy changes to their lifestyle in their 30s and 40s , they can control and potentially even reverse the natural progression of coronary artery disease ( illustrated ) ‘ it ’s not too late , ’ said @entity23 , lead investigator of the study and a professor of preventive medicine at @entity27 in @entity28			1
‘ you ’re not doomed if you ’ve hit young adulthood and acquired some bad habits			1
you can still make a change and it will have a benefit for your heart			0
’ however , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity39 , if people drop healthy habits or pick up more bad habits as they age , there is measurable , detrimental impact on their coronary arteries			1
coronary heart disease kills around 82,000 people in the @entity48 each year			2
about one in five men and one in eight women die from the disease			0
there are an estimated 2.7million people living with the condition			2
as well as angina - chest pain - the main symptoms of heart disease are heart attacks and heart failure			0
coronary heart disease describes what happens when the heart 's blood supply is blocked by a build - up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries			2
over time , the walls of the arteries become ' furred up , ' in a process called atherosclerosis			0
this can be caused by smoking , high cholesterol , high blood pressure and diabetes			0
‘ if you do n’t keep up a healthy lifestyle , you ’ll see the evidence in terms of your risk of heart disease , ’ professor @entity23 said			0
scientists based their research on 5,000 participants of the @entity85 in @entity86 ( @entity88 ) study , which examined people ’s lifestyle behaviours as well as coronary artery calcification and thickening between the ages of 18 and 30 – and 20 years later			1
the healthy lifestyle factors assessed were : not being overweight or obese , being a non-smoker , being physically active and eating healthily without drinking much alcohol			0
at the beginning of the study when the participants were young adults , less than 10 per cent of people reported all five healthy lifestyle behaviours			1
at the 20 - year mark , around one quarter of the participants had added at least one healthy lifestyle behaviour			1
increasing healthy lifestyle factors were linked with reduced odds of detectable coronary artery calcification and lower intima - media thickness , which are two major markers of cardiovascular disease that can predict future cardiovascular events			0
‘ this finding is important because it helps to debunk two myths held by some health care professionals , ’ said professor @entity23			0
‘ the first is that it ’s nearly impossible to change patients ’ behaviours			0
yet , we found that 25 per cent of adults made healthy lifestyle changes on their own			2
professor @entity23 said : ' you 're not doomed if you 've hit young adulthood and acquired some bad habits			1
you can still make a change and it will have a benefit for your heart ' ‘ the second myth is that the damage has already been done - adulthood is too late for healthy lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of developing coronary artery disease			2
' clearly , that ’s incorrect			0
' adulthood is not too late for healthy behaviour changes to help the heart			2
’ while some participants in the study became healthier in their lifestyle choices , 40 per cent of the sample dropped healthy habits and acquired more bad habits as they aged			1
‘ that loss of healthy habits had a measurable negative impact on their coronary arteries , ’ professor @entity23 said			1
increasing healthy lifestyle factors were linked with reduced odds of detectable coronary artery calcification and lower intima - media thickness , which are two major markers of cardiovascular disease that can predict future cardiovascular events			0
an illustration of a thickened and hardened artery is pictured ‘ each decrease in healthy lifestyle factors led to greater odds of detectable coronary artery calcification and higher intima - media thickness			0
' adulthood is n’t a “ safe period ” when one can abandon healthy habits without doing damage to the heart			1
' a healthy lifestyle requires upkeep to be maintained			0
' professor @entity23 said the healthy changes people in the study made are attainable and sustainable			1
she thinks that people can maintain a good lifestyle by not smoking , keeping a healthy body weight , doing 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week and eating a healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in salt , with lots of fruit and vegetables			1
she said that women should limit themselves to one alcoholic drink a day and men , a maximum of two drinks .			0

researchers at @entity27 in @entity28 based their findings on a study of 5,000 people
they *tracked* people 's lifestyles and measured the health of their arteries
they found a quarter of people added one healthy habit as they got older
the effects of bad habits adopted in early adulthood , such as a poor diet and smoking , can be controlled and reversed if action is taken by 50 , they said
but the scientists warned that healthy people who pick up extra bad habits as they age have a detrimental impact on their arteries
