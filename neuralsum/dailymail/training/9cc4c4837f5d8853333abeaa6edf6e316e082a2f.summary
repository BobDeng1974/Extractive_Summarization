by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:21 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 5 january 2013 when it was announced that @entity6 mandarin @entity4 will take over as @entity8 governor in the tiny paradise isle of @entity10 this summer , eyebrows were raised in the @entity11			1
the plum @entity13 posting – which includes the picture - postcard @entity15 ’ and a salary ‘ nudging six figures ’ – was expected to go to someone with a background in foreign affairs			1
yet all ms @entity4 ’s experience over the past 12 years has been at the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			2
picture - postcard : @entity4 will take over as @entity8 governor in @entity10 this summer			1
the posting includes the @entity28 ( pictured ) and a salary nudging six figures @entity30 found : miss @entity4 made her delight clear when her appointment in @entity10 ( pictured ) was announced in october however , one consequence of her surprise move is that she will no longer risk bumping into her estranged husband @entity35 in @entity36			1
he is principal private secretary to @entity38 , the second most powerful official in @entity39 , and deputy to cabinet secretary sir @entity41			0
the current governor of @entity10 is lifelong envoy @entity43 of the ten @entity44 with governors – including @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48 – seven appointments went to career diplomats , one to a senior official at the @entity52 and one to a former naval officer			1
by contrast , ms @entity4 , 38 , runs the @entity55 , which is in charge of responding to @entity8 crises such as natural disasters or terrorism			1
she has never worked at the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , which customarily protects such appointments with jealousy			0
@entity4 ( pictured ) runs the @entity55 which is in charge of responding to @entity8 crises ms @entity4 fell in love with mr @entity35 , 39 , when they worked for the last @entity66 administration			1
they married in 2005 but friends were dismayed to learn over a year ago that the couple had separated			0
their paths crossed again at work when @entity23 official mr @entity35 was promoted to his current no 10 post			2
it meant working alongside ms @entity4 , who is based in the @entity25 , which is connected to @entity39 by an internal passage			2
the high - powered and sensitive nature of ms @entity4 ’s work as the civil servant in charge of @entity80 – the cabinet committee that deals with national emergencies – means she comes into close contact with mr @entity38 and his senior aides such as mr @entity35			1
last night , both @entity36 and the @entity11 denied any impropriety in the appointment process or that it had been influenced by a desire to keep the couple apart , saying her personal circumstances were not relevant			1
they added that it was ‘ not unusual ’ to be appointed to a @entity92 without a background at the @entity11			0
ms @entity4 made her delight clear when her little - noticed appointment was announced in october , saying : ‘ it is a great honour to be appointed as governor			1
i very much look forward to working with the people of @entity10 and their elected representatives as they build a vibrant , successful and resilient future			2
’ mr @entity35 advised mr @entity38 before his appearance at the @entity102 into media ethics and accompanied him when he gave evidence			2
he was also involved in the investigation into claims that @entity107 whip @entity107 swore at a policeman at @entity36 ’s gates			0
ms @entity4 , who will be known by the grand title of ‘ her excellency the governor ’ , can expect less stress and improved working conditions , 4,000 miles away in @entity10			1
prime mover : @entity35 , @entity38 's principal private secretary is miss @entity4 's estranged husband @entity120 , near the capital , @entity118 , is an idyllic location and has hosted the @entity122 on official visits			1
at weekends ms @entity4 will be able to relax on its palm - fringed beaches			2
@entity10 ’s large measure of internal self - government means the governor ’s role , which includes dealing with policing and the remote prospect of invasion , is mainly ceremonial			1
@entity10 has a population of just 13,500 , the same as a small @entity137 town , and is 16 miles long by three miles across at its widest point			0
according to legend , @entity10 was first sighted and named by @entity140 and colonised by @entity137 settlers in the 1600s			0
it is a tax haven and , until last year , had no income tax			0
not surprisingly , it is now an upmarket tourist destination			0
last night , an @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ it is standard practice for the @entity11 to advertise all senior positions across @entity6			0
it opens up the field of competition and helps us attract the most talented candidates			0
@entity4 was appointed to this role from a strong field of candidates after a successful interview in which she was assessed to be the best person for the job			2
the competition was open and fair			0
‘ @entity4 has relevant experience drawn from a range of roles from across @entity6 , as well as extensive domestic policy experience , which will make her an asset to the @entity11 and the government of @entity10			1
’ an @entity11 source added : ‘ the job of a governor is like no other in the @entity11 ... it is not about the diplomatic influencing of another country ’s government , it is more about being a part of that executive			0
it means understanding how public policy is delivered , and how to work through the machinations of politics			0
’ a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ she was a strong candidate			0

@entity4 will take over as @entity8 governor on island of @entity10
@entity186 includes a governor 's *residence* and a salary nudging six figures
