by @entity0 three years after the biggest nuclear disaster since @entity2 struck the east coast of @entity5 , many regions still lie desolate			0
the clean - up effort is hindered due to the continued risk of radiation to human workers and , as a result , drones have been sent in to record the destruction			2
during this mission , one drone captured the sheer extent of the devastation as it swept across the @entity5 ghost town of @entity18			0
during the eight - minute video , the drone soars over @entity27 's radioactive and barren landscapes			1
the fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the @entity30 on 11 march 2011			0
it was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami , triggered by the 9.0 @entity35 earthquake			1
this led to three of the plant ’s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials			1
reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean - up effort difficult			2
a total of 300,000 people evacuated the @entity30 area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami			0
the footage was taken by @entity22 - based multicopter firm @entity21			1
during the eight - minute video , the drone soars over the region ’s landscapes said to be covered in radioactive soil			1
it travels over the coast capturing how it was battered and destroyed by the tsunami , triggered by the 9.0 @entity35 earthquake in 2011			1
a train station is shown as abandoned , a school field remains empty and a fishing boat has been dropped on the land miles away from the sea			0
