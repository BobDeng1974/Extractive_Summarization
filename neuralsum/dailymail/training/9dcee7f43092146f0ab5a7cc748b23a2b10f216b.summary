by @entity1 reporter it almost looks like it is sleeping , but sadly , this little frog will not jump again as it froze solid trying to cross a lake in @entity5			1
it is thought that a sudden rise in temperatures fooled the hibernating amphibian and it ventured out across the lake to find a girlfriend			1
however , as the lake froze , possibly overnight , the frog would have returned to hibernation out in the open , and died from the cold			1
@entity13 shouldered : this unfortunate frog froze to death as he attempted to find a mate on @entity17 , just outside of @entity18 , @entity5 photographer @entity19 , 54 , discovered the creature caught out by freezing conditions			1
he said : ‘ i was out skating for a couple of hours and , suddenly ; i saw something on the surface of the ice			1
when i saw it was a frog , frozen stiff , i was quite shocked			2
i have never seen anything like it before			2
’ he said : ‘ it was a sad thing to see , but at the same time it was quite beautiful			2
i think this frog was trying to find a hole in the ice and swim back to shore once the lake started to freeze			2
‘ the poor thing obviously did n't make it and was left stuck to the ice i do n't think it would have been there for very long as something would have taken it to eat			0
’ beauty sleep : the poor amphibian did not make it to the other side , and despite daring to cross the ice , he died trying @entity48 - mate : the lovelorn frog met a tragic end , although it merely looks like he is sleeping mr @entity19 captured the shot while skating on @entity17 , just outside of @entity18			1
he said : ‘ it was a once - in - a - lifetime photograph			0
i am very lucky to have captured it			0
’ @entity55 , conservation coordinator at @entity57 conservation charity @entity56 , said the frog could have been looking for a mate when it froze			1
he said : ‘ it is fairly common to see frogs crossing areas covered in snow			0
some frogs hibernate on the water but most hibernate on land in the vicinity of a body of water			0
‘ i think that for whatever reason the frog became active again during hibernation			0
there was probably a slightly warmer period which led the frog to become active , perhaps for reproduction			0
‘ it was probably in search of a mate and was crossing the lake when the temperature dropped again , probably overnight , and it was frozen to the lake			0
’ although frogs normally hibernate during the winter , a raise in temperature could have fooled the amphibian to think that it was springtime , and it awoke to find a mate			1

the unfortunate amphibian froze in his step as he attempted to cross @entity17 , just outside of @entity18
