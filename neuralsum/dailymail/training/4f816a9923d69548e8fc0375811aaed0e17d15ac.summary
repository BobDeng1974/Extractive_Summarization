by @entity1 reporter published : 15:42 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 18:16 est , 27 june 2013 a fat chunk of metal crashed into a @entity6 family 's home sunday out of the clear blue			2
the three - pound piece of lead smashed clear through a @entity6 , @entity14 family 's roof and left a shoe box - sized hole in their ceiling			2
no one was injured , but the family and authorities are scratching their heads wondering where it could have come from			0
surprise ! a family was shocked sunday when this chunk of lead smashed through their roof and into their @entity6 home though the incident happened over the weekend , the family waited until tuesday to call the police			1
a responding officer inspected the hole and decided one of two things happened			0
either the rectangular hunk of lead fell off an aircraft or , the officer said , ' a really big bird that had stolen a lead bar			1
' however , the @entity45 has nixed the first possibility			1
damaged : the lead bar left a shoe box sized hole in the roof of their @entity6 home ' the @entity45 has concluded its investigation into the metal part that was found in the @entity6 home , ' @entity45 spokesperson @entity52 told @entity56			1
' after examining the part , investigators have concluded that this object did not come from an aircraft			2
' so where did the offending metal piece originate ? a bird ? police said it likely came form a plane , but the @entity45 concluded ' this object did not come from an aircraft ' the only clues are two holes in the bar , as if to accomodate bolts , and an only partially readable serial number			1
@entity74 reports that viewers in @entity6 responded to the story and many seemed to believe the bar is a wood chipper tooth			0
while someone is grinding wood and tree stumps , they said , it 's possible for a ' tooth ' to fly out along with the wood chips			0
chipping in ? viewers of a local news station that ran the story wrote in with a different possibility			0
they said the hole was made by a grinding ' tooth ' from a wood chipper			0

police *guessed* it came from a plane overhead
@entity45 officials say its definitely not from an aircraft
