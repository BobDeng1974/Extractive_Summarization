by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 09:19 est , 8 march 2014 people who have trouble sleeping tend to have less volume in certain regions of the brain than those without sleep problems , a new study of @entity4 veterans suggests			1
' people discount the importance of sleep			0
so many things seem so much more important than a few extra hours of sleep a night , ' lead author @entity15 told @entity0			0
' the study suggests we should n't discount sleep importance , ' she said			2
the researchers of the study studied the brains of 144 mostly male veterans using @entity25 @entity26 , from the @entity27 , collaborated with researchers at the @entity29 in @entity30 on the study published in the journal @entity33			1
previous research has linked sleep disturbances to structural brain changes , the authors note			2
in their study , sleep was associated with the amount of gray matter in the brain 's frontal lobe in particular			1
' there 's other corroborating data showing that insomnia and a variety of psychiatric illnesses are reflected in reduced volumes in the brain , which makes sense because sleep and mood are functions of the brain , ' dr. @entity44 told @entity0			0
a psychiatrist , @entity44 is chief of the sleep disorders clinical research program at @entity60 in @entity61			0
he was not involved in the current study			1
he described the frontal lobes as " an essential part of human functioning , " necessary for planning , strategizing , mood and @entity68 with post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity69 ) frequently complain about sleep difficulties , according to @entity26 and her colleagues			2
studies have found high rates of sleep disorders among veterans of @entity78 's wars in @entity79 and @entity80 who had head injuries or @entity69 ( see @entity0 story of october 28 , 2011			1
people with reduced sleep quality had reduced frontal lobe gray matter and more psychological problems than people who did n't for the current study , the researchers scanned the brains of 144 mostly male veterans using magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity25 )			1
they measured sleep quality with the @entity93 , a crude , self - rated index that asks broad questions about sleep patterns over the past month			2
for example , the index asks participants a single question about the time they usually went to bed over the past month and another about how long it usually took them to fall asleep			0
the researchers found participants who reported poor quality sleep overall had less frontal lobe gray matter than vets who reported sleeping relatively well			1
in addition to sleep troubles , a host of psychological problems plagued the study veterans			1
@entity115 had abused alcohol , 40 percent had had major depressive disorder at some point and 18 percent had ptsd			0
still , the link between sleep troubles and brain volume held even after the researchers took those problems and psychotropic medicine use into account			2
the more people study veteran sleep patterns the more they can help veterans improve their life and their mood @entity44 cautioned against inferring a cause - and - effect relationship between sleep and brain volume or generalizing the results of a study on veterans with a range of psychiatric problems to the general population			1
but @entity26 believes the findings could apply to anyone , not just war veterans			0
although she stressed that the study underscores the importance of a good night 's sleep , she agreed that it 's not possible to say that troubled sleep causes a decrease in frontal lobe gray matter , or vice versa			1
' we only know there 's a relationship , ' @entity153 , an @entity154 clinical psychologist who is board - certified in sleep disorders , told @entity0			0
' we do n't know which came first			0
' @entity153 was not involved in the current study			1
he applauded the researchers for examining sleep patterns in war veterans , a group particularly plagued with disturbed sleep			2
' if they 've been in an active theater of war , they have n't slept well since they 've been in an active war , ' he said			0
he said polysomnography , which monitors people 's sleep and collects objective data , would have made the results of the current study more @entity177 also said she would have preferred to use objective sleep data			1
but the current report was based on a second look at data from a prior study			0
' the data says to us this could be a very interesting population to learn more about , ' @entity153 said			0
' if we can learn more about veteran sleep , we can help them sleep more			0

for the current study , the researchers scanned the brains of 144 mostly male veterans using magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity25 )
the researchers found participants who reported poor quality sleep overall had less frontal lobe gray matter than vets who reported sleeping relatively well
having less frontal gray matter was also linked to having more psychological problems
