determined : home secretary @entity0 said the government must ' redouble ' its efforts to stamp out female genital mutilation the public would be ' shocked ' to know how many young girls are subjected to female genital mutilation in the @entity6 , home secretary @entity0 said yesterday			1
speaking in the @entity7 , she said the government was doing everything it could to warn young women about the dangers of the practice			1
although the secrecy surrounding female genital mutilation ( @entity16 ) means it is hard to determine the scale of the problem , there are thought to be around 66,000 affected women and girls living in @entity22 and @entity23			1
the practice occurs in 28 @entity25 and middle - eastern countries , and is most common among @entity6 's 600,000 ethnic @entity25			1
mrs may said : ' sadly , what we see are too many examples of this terrible crime continuing to take place			0
i think most people would be shocked to know how many young girls within the @entity6 are subjected to female genital mutilation			1
' we need to redouble our efforts to make sure we educate young girls about the prospects of being taken abroad or having this done to them , but also ensure that we educate others not to do this terrible act			1
' her comments followed a question from @entity47 mp @entity46 ( @entity48 and @entity49 ) , who noted that yesterday was the @entity51 ' @entity50 , and called the practice a ' violent and dreadful crime '			2
also known as female circumcision or simply as ' cutting ' , female genital mutilation involves removing all or part of the clitoris , the surrounding labia ( the outer part of the vagina ) and sometimes the sewing up of the vagina , leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood			0
the barbaric tradition has no medical benefits , and is carried out for cultural reasons , often because it demonstrates a girl 's virginity on her wedding night			2
in cultures where mutilation is common , ' uncut ' girls are considered more likely to be promiscuous , unhygienic , and prone to diseases such as hiv / aids			2
families often club together to fly professional ' cutters ' to the @entity6 from @entity25 , after which they perform mutilations on pre-pubescent girls for as little as Â£ 40 , often without anaesthetic , using blunt knives , razor blades or scalpels			2
painful secret : many women who have suffered genital mutilation are too frightened to speak out because they risk being shunned by their communities ( picture posed by model ) in other cases , girls are flown abroad to their family 's native country to help minimise the risk of detection			1
the practice is illegal under the 2003 @entity100 , and carries a jail term of up to 14 years			1
despite this , no - one has yet been successfully prosecuted			2
in the short - term @entity16 may cause severe pain , potentially life - threatening bleeding and infection			2
in the longer - term , it can lead to severe complications in childbirth , substantial pain during intercourse and lasting psychological trauma			0
an @entity111 on @entity50 ( @entity16 ) was launched in december 2011 to raise awareness and eliminate @entity16 in the @entity6			0
more than 50 mps and @entity114 of all parties are now involved			0
@entity116 , head of @entity6 programmes at the anti-mutilation charity forward , described this as ' a small step towards improvement '			0
she said there are presently around 24,000 girls in @entity6 aged under 15 who are thought to be at high risk of genital mutilation			1
@entity118 exists to help safeguard women and girls , as well as supporting those living with the consequences of @entity16			1
mrs @entity116 praised parliament 's increased focus on the practice , but said the results had not yet become visible on the ground			0
she said : ' i have had around 15 child protection queries come to me since august			0
there has n't been a recent decrease in the number of referrals we get that relate to @entity16			0
' one big shift in how @entity16 could be dealt with is if there was an improvement in data collection			0
' often i think female genital mutilation is not treated as a priority , and that needs to change			0

66,000 women and girls in @entity22 and @entity23 subjected to illegal and barbaric practice , say *experts*
24,000 under 15 - year - olds believed to be at high risk
