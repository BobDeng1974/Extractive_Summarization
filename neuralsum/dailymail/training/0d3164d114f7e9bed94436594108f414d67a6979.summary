@entity0 , 55 , from @entity2 , @entity3 , was attempting to compare his finger to that on a marble sculpture at the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) when he amputated the digit			1
what makes the accident even more embarrassing is that married @entity0 is an emergency surgeon at @entity21 , @entity3 - surely someone who is better than most with being careful with his hands			1
and in a further excruciating twist , @entity0 was arrested and taken into custody in front of his wife and his two college - aged children			1
it is believed @entity0 was comparing his own hand to that of the statue when the mishap occurred			1
a security guard spotted him doing it and tried to stop him , but it was too late			0
@entity0 was mortified and apologized profusely , fearing prosecution and a massive fine for damaging the historic piece of work			2
the sculpture was created in the 14th or 15th century by @entity42			1
@entity43 , an @entity1 who is the head of the @entity45 of @entity46 and @entity47 and the @entity48 in @entity7 , condemned his countryman 's behavior			0
uh-oh : @entity0 broke the pinky finger off a 600 - year - old marble statue at a @entity7 museum over the weekend			1

‘ the man told me it was a spontaneous impulse			0
‘ he put in hand out in an unthinking gesture to measure the size of the hands of the virgin against those of his own			0
‘ a guard immediately saw and told him not to touch , but the little finger had come off exposing a metal rod inside			2
‘ he seemed to have forgotten the basic rule of museums that you do n’t touch things			0
‘ afterwards he was absolutely embarrassed and very sorry			0
‘ it was a strange sort of forgetfulness as this man to all appearances seemed like a regular museum goer , not a busman on holiday			0
‘ it ’s not a tragedy as all the fingers have been restored before and are not marble but plaster held with metal rods			0
and thankfully we have a technical person in the museum who has fixed a finger before			2
