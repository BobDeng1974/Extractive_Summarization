by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 19 november 2013 @entity1 contestants @entity2 and @entity4 tucked into pig 's brain , camel toe and even an ostrich penis during the dreaded @entity9 last night			0
but while most of us watch , cringing , from between our fingers , while they scoff the jungle delicacies , one @entity11 restaurant believes people will actually pay to experience it themselves			2
@entity18 , a pan-asian haunt frequented by the likes of @entity21 and @entity22 , has unveiled a menu packed with creepy crawlies and gory pig 's brain in honour of the show 's @entity9			1
the @entity30 - inspired @entity29 serves up scorpion and ant tempura served with @entity34 chilli dressing ( £ 15 ) , fish eye maki sushi rolls ( £ 9 ) and ginseng @entity37 fish head and eyeball soup ( £ 14 ) - and that 's just for starters			1
@entity42 in ! @entity2 ( r ) and @entity4 ( @entity43 ) battled it out on @entity1 by eating ostrich testicles and creepy crawlies - and now you can do the same for the more daring foodie there 's the £ 14 bull and duck tongue stir fry mixed with @entity53 noodles , choy sum and peashoots or the meaty pig brain served in a bun with tomato relish and salad garnish for £ 12			0
if that was n't enough to whet your appetite , there 's an £ 8 selection of @entity30 vomit fruit sorbets including durian fruit - which a writer on travel blog gadling.com described as ' smelling like road kill wrapped in sweaty socks and having the texture of rotten bananas ' - for dessert			1
does it look appetizing ? @entity18 , a high - end pan asian , are offering a selection of gruesome meals such as fish eye maki sushi rolls ( £ 9 ) tasty tongue : diners can enjoy the £ 14 bull and duck tongue stir - fry mixed with @entity53 noodles , choy sum and peashoots on a plus note , @entity85 claim that those brave enough to take on the challenge are in for a health boost			1
they say crickets , which are one of the more common insects eaten ( or at least tried ) in the @entity92 , are a rich source of protein and high in calcium , while bull tongue is apparently high in protein and vitamin b - 12 , which boosts the production of red blood cells			0
the durian vomit fruit apparently has euphoric effect when eaten as a dessert and is packed full of oestrogen which is thought to make women more fertile			1
not your average @entity106 : diners can sample the meaty pig brain served in a bun with tomato relish and salad garnish for £ 12 sign away : diners have to sign a disclaimer before they tuck into the culinary delights , such as these battered scorpions and ants @entity118 diners can sample the menu only after signing a disclaimer agreeing that they are happy to do so			1
the disclaimer will state that @entity18 can not be held responsible for any consequences diners may suffer during or after eating the dishes			1
the dishes can be ordered separately or as a three - course set menu priced at £ 32.50			2
those that manage to munch their way through the entire set menu wo n’t pay a penny and will receive a certificate for their daredevil efforts			2
@entity134 at @entity135 said : ' eating insects is certainly popular in countries such as @entity138 where you can buy them from supermarkets and pick them up from road - side stalls			0
' they are a great source of protein and naturally low in fat , as well as essential vitamins such as @entity149 and @entity150			0
and while it 's not something i could ever eat , they are thought to soon become the new super trendy food due to their nutrient value			0
there are certainly worse , more unhealthy things you could eat			0
' ready to give @entity2 a run for his money ? can you stomach it ? last night saw @entity164 tuck into half a pork chow - a pig 's brain - in order to win one meal for camp			0
