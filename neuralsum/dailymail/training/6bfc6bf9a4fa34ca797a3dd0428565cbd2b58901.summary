a 32st sumo wrestler who has spent 30 years and £ 9,000 learning to drive claims she ca n't pass her test because she is unable to fit in the instructors ' cars			1
professional wrestler @entity5 , from @entity6 , has had 10 instructors turn her away from driving lessons because she was unable to squeeze behind the wheel of their vehicles			1
she has already spent £ 9,000 trying to gain her driving licence - and has even sat the driving test five times , spending £ 62 on each go , with no success			1
and even when she has been able to get behind the wheel for the test , she says her nerves get the better of her			2
miss @entity5 explained : ' i 'm six foot tall and the cars people learn to drive in are just too small			1
' when i book a lesson with a new instructor i always tell them " i 'm as big as sumo wrestler " but i do n't think they take me literally ! ' in the last few years i 'm sure they 've even got smaller			1
miss @entity5 in action as a professional sumo wrestler taking part in the women 's @entity41 final at the @entity44 @entity43 last year ' even when i try and warn instructors on the phone by saying that i 'm a big person and there needs to be room for two giants it has gone wrong			1
' i once went all the way to @entity52 in the hope of an instructor who would fit me in - but when i arrived the seatbelt did n't go round me and i had to buy a seatbelt extender			0
' ten instructors have just flat out said no. they 're never rude , they always try and help but i 've been told if the steering wheel does n't turn freely in front of me it 's just not safe for me to drive			2
' and more than once i 've turned up and , even though i 've fitted into the car , the instructor has n't been able to get in after me			0
' it makes me nervous that i 'm not cut out to drive and i really suffer with nerves - it 's just so difficult under pressure			0
miss @entity5 has so far been unable to gain her driving licence despite sitting the test five times miss @entity5 has admitted that during the driving test , she suffers from nerves and says when it comes to the test , she just ' goes to pieces ' ' whether i 've been doing the most recent set of lessons for six months or six years i still have the same nerve problems ' when it comes to the test i just go to pieces			1
' but even when miss @entity5 has been able to make it behind the wheels of a car , she has struggled to make it out of first gear			1
this is despite spending a year taking classes with the @entity86 costing £ 1700 , doing three at intensive courses at £ 750 a time and having lessons with another six private instructors over the years			2
however , she still manages to clock up both majors and minors , when it comes to sitting the test			0
at the moment she has to spend £ 100 a day on taxis to so she can visit her parents , who are ill and live on opposite sides of @entity6 , to care for them			0
sumo wrestler miss @entity5 , pictured competing in @entity98 last year , weighs in at 32 stone and is six foot tall after realising that it was unsustainable to spend so much money , she has now signed up for an intervention and is currently being taught to drive by instructor @entity103 from the @entity104 show @entity105			1
miss @entity5 explained : ' i was spending hundreds on taxis every week and i realised that if i had a car things would be so much easier so i started trying to learn again without much luck			1
' desperate times called for desperate measures and i knew i needed professional help so i signed up for the show			0
' @entity103 has given me the confidence and brought me faith in myself to believe that when i finally get to take the test - i 'll be ready			2
' i fell down the stairs during filming and ended up on crutches so i could n't take the test before the show ended			0
' but @entity103 is still in touch and helping me get back in the car - that 's just the kind of person she is			0
she wants to see me succeed			0
' it 's crazy thinking about it			0
i 've had hundreds of lessons and spent thousands of pounds and i 'm still waiting to pass			2
