by contrast , in @entity14 , @entity15 , a horse struggled to find any grass to eat in a wintry field			0
despite many parts of the @entity20 being buffeted by wind , rain and snow , @entity7 in @entity8 was warm enough for daffodils to grow , spotted by local @entity9 ( pictured ) while walking her cocker spaniel @entity12 the rest of the country was not as lucky as @entity8 with heavy snow in some areas including @entity14 , @entity15 where a horse struggled to find any grass to eat in a wintry field ( pictured ) the forecast is for more snow over @entity34 and @entity35 until tuesday			1
the @entity36 says that most of the @entity37 is expected to escape the snow , although it will be frosty and then wet as a band of rain sweeps in from across the @entity41			0
