by @entity0 last updated at 2:03 pm on 13th january 2012 @entity2 's kepler space telescope has discovered the three smallest planets yet detected orbiting a star beyond our @entity5 - one of which is as small as @entity7			1
the planets orbit a single star , called @entity10 , and are between three - quarters and half the size of @entity13			1
the star itself is a tiny , cool red dwarf - leading @entity2 to comment , ' honey , i shrunk the planetary system			1
' all three planets are thought to be rocky like @entity13			1
of the more than 700 planets confirmed to orbit other stars , called exoplanets , only a handful are known to be rocky			2
all three planets are thought to be rocky like @entity13			2
of the more than 700 planets confirmed to orbit other stars , called exoplanets , only a handful are known to be rocky the three planets are very close to their star , taking less than two days to orbit around it			2
the @entity30 is a red dwarf with a diameter one - sixth that of our @entity5 , making it just 70 percent bigger than @entity33 ' astronomers are just beginning to confirm the thousands of planet candidates uncovered by @entity36 so far , ' said @entity37 , @entity36 program scientist at @entity38 in @entity39			1
' finding one as small as @entity7 is amazing , and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all around us			2
' kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars , looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by crossing , or transiting , planets			0
red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our @entity55 galaxy			1
the discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets using data from @entity38 ’s @entity36 , @entity63 astronomers announced the discovery of two new solar systems where planets orbit two stars - like the fictional planet @entity70 in @entity71 ( pictured )			1
this work establishes that such ' two sun ' planets are not rare exceptions , but are in fact common with many millions existing in our @entity77			0
both systems reside in the constellation @entity81 , with @entity82 at 4,900 light - years from @entity13 , and @entity36 - 35 at 5,400 light - years , making these among the most distant planets discovered			2
the latest discovery comes from a team led by astronomers at the @entity87			0
the team used data publicly released by the @entity36 mission , along with follow - up observations from the @entity91 , near @entity92 , and the @entity93 atop @entity94 in @entity95			0
their measurements dramatically revised the sizes of the planets from what was originally estimated , revealing their small @entity100 three planets are very close to their star , taking less than two days to orbit around it			0
the @entity30 is a red dwarf with a diameter one - sixth that of our @entity5 , making it just 70 percent bigger than @entity33			1
' this is the tiniest solar system found so far , ' said @entity108 , the principal investigator of the research from @entity38 ’s @entity110 at the @entity87 in @entity111			0
' it ’s actually more similar to @entity33 and its moons in scale than any other planetary system			0
the discovery is further proof of the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy			0
' red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our @entity55 galaxy			1
the discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets			1
' these types of systems could be ubiquitous in the universe , ' said @entity135 , lead author of the new study from @entity87			0
' this is a really exciting time for planet hunters			0

tiny planets are rocky , like @entity13
orbit a red dwarf - the most common kind of star in the our @entity55 galaxy
hints that planets like these could be common
