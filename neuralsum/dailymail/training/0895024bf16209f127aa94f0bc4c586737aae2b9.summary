by @entity0 published : 21:09 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 29 october 2013 an adventurous treasure hunter claims he has found a legendary lost gold mine in the mountains of northeastern @entity5 - a $ 1.7billion bonanza first discovered by @entity8 priests in 1650 that has laid dormant for more than three centuries			1
@entity10 believes that he and his son have found the @entity13 mine at @entity14 in the @entity15 - and they only need federal government permission to delve deep enough to claim their prize , the @entity21 newspaper reports			1
the @entity22 was fabled to be the richest gold mine in the world			0
it was first documented by @entity8 @entity26 priests in 1650			1
discovery : @entity28 , pictured , and his father @entity29 say they have found an abandoned @entity8 gold mine from the 1600s the @entity32 is skeptical , saying the cavern is likely a natural formation and that it contains no gold deposits the explorers say they have found calcite semi-precious gemstones in the cavern , but no gold but @entity32 officials say the mine is a fairy tale - and treasure hunters are defacing a natural cave and destroying formations that are millions of years old as they search for riches			1
mr @entity10 told the @entity21 that he has yet to find gold in the cavern			2
he obtained a mining permit and said he has so far pulled millions of dollars worth of calcite crystals from the shaft			0
he markets them as ' @entity55 ' and says they could become valuable as semi-precious gemstones			0
so far , though , the spelunking into the cavern has not yet yielded any gold			0
in a 2009 post on the treasure hunter forum @entity63 , mr @entity10 suggests that the mine could contain $ 1.7billion in gold			1
officials say the ' @entity55 ' mining operation is little more than a ruse to allow mr @entity10 to continue looking for gold			2
the caver is at the bottom of a deep shaft that mr @entity10 and his friends have been exploring for years this is a ' @entity55 ' outcropping - calcite that mr @entity10 believes he can sell for millions as a semi-precious stone revolution : the mine was abandoned by the @entity8 in 1680 during the @entity79 when @entity80 drove them from their claims in @entity83 he says the hunt for gold is ' still in active development			1
' references to the the @entity89 first appear in records of @entity92 priests in 1650			0
it was said to be the most valuable gold mine in the world			0
three decades later , the priests were forced to abandon the mind when the @entity8 were driven out of the @entity98 during the 1680 @entity100 uprising by the @entity101			2
the exact location of the mine has been lost ever since			0
but , @entity32 archeologist @entity104 , says the the myth of the @entity89 being in northeast @entity5 is nothing but a fairy tale			1
' if we had those kinds of gold mines in the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , i 'd be a rich man , ' he told the @entity21			0
' a lot of treasure hunters will map on a natural solution cavity and try to purport that it 's a historic or ancient mine and then try to mine it			1
' location : other explorers have long believed that the that the lost mine - with untold riches - was located at @entity14 in northeastern @entity5			2

@entity10 , *72* , discovered a cavern in the @entity15 of @entity5 that they believe is an old @entity8 mine
mine was established by @entity8 @entity26 priests in 1650
it was abandoned in 1680 during the @entity131 revolution and never found again
@entity32 says treasure hunters are destroying natural caverns *chasing* fairy tales
