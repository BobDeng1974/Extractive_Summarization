she had already seen her doctor in august 2008 believing her severe headache was caused by an insect bite - but attended hospital the next month when her condition did not improve			1
ms @entity2 was given painkillers and told to contact her gp if her symptoms continued			1
but after collapsing and having a seizure four days later , she arrived at @entity30 at 8.25pm			2
but the shop assistant was not booked in for a ct scan until 19 hours after arriving - despite repeated requests and her family history of haemorrhages			1
the ct scan had actually been cancelled while she waited for an mri scan			1
but her condition worsened and she died of a brain haemorrhage caused by the rupture of an artery aneurysm			1
by the time a scan showed the brain haemorrhage , it was too late to save her			1
her brother @entity43 said he could not understand the delays in diagnosis when there was a family history of brain haemorrhages			2
he told the court : ‘ i said to the doctor “ she is having a brain haemorrhage ”			1
i said “ she will leave here in a body bag ”			0
’ faults : in 2011 , @entity30 accepted that with the right care she was unlikely to have died and paid a ' significant ' sum of compensation to her 21 - year - old son in 2011 , @entity30 accepted that with the right care she was unlikely to have died and paid a ‘ significant ’ sum of compensation to her 21 - year - old son , @entity63			1
the @entity30 admitted in its apologetic letter that she should have been referred for a ct scan on her visit to hospital			1
it said : ‘ this would have shown the presence of a haemorrhage and she would then have been transferred to the @entity71 at @entity72			2
evidence : her brother @entity43 said he could not understand the delays in diagnosis when there was a family history of brain haemorrhages ‘ an angiogram would then have identified the aneurysm and subsequent treatment would have given her a survival rate of 80 to 85 per cent			0
’ the inquest yesterday heard there were four occasions when an opportunity was missed to give her a ct scan			1
this would have meant she could have had an operation giving her the ‘ best chance ’ of survival , a serious untoward incident report by the hospital found			0
chances were missed when she visited her gp , in @entity96 on september 4 , when she went back to hospital on september 8 and on the morning of september 9 - the day she later died			2
recording that she died of natural causes , coroner @entity98 said : ‘ it ’s not clear why the scan took so many hours to carry out			2
‘ it has been suggested there may have been problems with the equipment			0
one hopes the lessons learned - and indeed lessons must be learned - have been followed up			0
’ speaking after the inquest , mr @entity43 said : ‘ i know the doctors involved did n’t leave the house in the morning and intend for this to happen , but a mistake has caused the death of my sister			0
‘ it ’s as if no - one has got any responsibility for what they are doing			0
’ a @entity30 spokesman said : ‘ we are sorry for the circumstances surrounding @entity2 ’s death , and once again extend our condolences to her family			2
' i said to the doctor , " she is having a brain haemorrhage "			2
i said " she will leave here in a body bag " ' @entity43 , brother ‘ this was investigated by the @entity30 and we accept that there are things we should have done differently			0
‘ as a result of our investigation , recommendations were made and measures have been put in place to try to prevent this being repeated			0
’ after the hospital ’s apology in 2011 , her mother @entity142 revealed she suffered a brain haemorrhage at the age of 21 and said doctors should have been more aware that her daughter may have had a heightened risk of a similar attack			1
' we accept that there are things we should have done differently ' @entity30 spokesman she said : ‘ i collapsed in 1967 and a doctor came out immediately			0
he knew it was serious and i was rushed to hospital			0
there were no scans in those days so they gave me a lumbar puncture and found i had a brain haemorrhage			1
‘ but they missed so many chances to save @entity164			0
they should have sent her for a scan regardless , it ’s because of that she ’s not here today			0
‘ it seems to me the treatment i got in the 60s was better than the care she got and that ’s why she ’s no longer with us			0
’ performing arts student mr @entity63 said : ‘ she was in hospital for hours until she had a fit without having a brain scan			2
throughout the night she kept complaining of head pains , i told the doctors and nurses this throughout the night			0
