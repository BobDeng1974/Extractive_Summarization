and with the huge dangers she faced in the war - torn country , @entity12 has spoken previously of the debt she owed to @entity17 - who , she says , helped to save her life after she was ambushed by a masked gunman in 1998			1
but as well as owing her life to the highly - decorated officer , the 51 - year - old has also revealed for the first time that @entity17 was the father of the unborn daughter she was carrying at the time of the attack			1
the @entity27 of @entity28 @entity12 , pictured with @entity29 in the @entity11 , who she has revealed for the first time also father her daughter @entity12 , who rescued up to 250 children from @entity9 and @entity34 during the @entity36 conflict , says that she has only now decided to reveal the truth following @entity39 's death in 2009			1

speaking about when she first told the former army officer that she was expecting his child , she said : ' i rang to tell @entity56 and his first words were , ' i would be honoured to father your child			1
' @entity61 aid worker @entity12 rescued the lives of up to 250 children during the @entity11 conflict ' then he dropped the bombshell that he was still married and he asked me to never reveal he was @entity49 's father			1
' i have always respected that but when @entity56 died i realised i had no - one to protect any more			2
' @entity12 , who now lives in @entity67 , has previously said that she owed her life to @entity39 , who headed up the @entity70 monitoring mission in the @entity11 war			1

' he was very charismatic and extremely knowledgeable , with a great sense of humour			2
' when the nurses left , there was no one around to perform the minor surgical procedure necessary for my leg wound to heal			2
so @entity56 , who was trained in field medicine , took over			2
' five or six times a day , i gritted my teeth while he dug away at the wound			0
he patiently removed the blue cotton threads that were blasted through my leg on the point of the bullet			0
he also had to snip away dead tissue to avoid the gangrene			0
' i have no doubt that without his help , i would have lost my leg			0
' as well as making the startling revelations about the identity of her daughter 's father , the former aid worker - who was tasked with being part of the team who carried the @entity106 flag into the stadium at last weekend 's @entity108 - spoke of her devastation upon hearing news of @entity39 's death in her new book ' sunflowers and @entity115 '			1
she wrote that it broke her heart that he had chosen to die alone			0
in a previous interview , the @entity27 of @entity28 has also spoken of the admiration for the man she now admits fathered her child			2
she said : ' on his days off , @entity56 liked to go fishing			0
on one trip he saw a group of people in some distress			0
a small boy had been chasing after his dog when there was an explosion and the dog was killed			2
@entity12 , far right , carried the @entity134 during the @entity108 of the @entity135 last friday night ' the child was now trapped in the minefield , afraid to move			1
' slowly , @entity56 crawled towards the child , using a knife to gently detect mines buried just beneath the surface			0
he managed to reach the boy and brought him safely back to his family			0
' @entity56 had n't mentioned it to anyone , but when the family entered the town talking about the heroic action of the man with red hair and a hook , he was soon tracked down and was later awarded a medal for his bravery			0
' @entity12 , right , was imprisoned during her time in the @entity11 after trying to cross the border between @entity78 and @entity155 with refugees @entity39 served in the @entity157 before joining the @entity158 in 1969 , serving with the @entity159 until 1975			1
he went on to serve with @entity61 officers in the @entity161			0
he was awarded both the mbe and the obe			0
his last overseas trip saw him run humanitarian projects in @entity166 before retiring last november			0
@entity12 added : ' i had n't seen @entity168 for several years but i knew he was in @entity166 recently			1
so when i heard the tragic news , i immediately assumed he had been killed by a stray bullet or bomb			2
' i was profoundly shocked to hear that he died alone on a park bench in @entity176			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
