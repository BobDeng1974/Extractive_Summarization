by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 11 april 2013 innovative : @entity2 is reintroducing serialised novels to readers in the form of e-books the serialised novel , made famous by @entity9 authors such as @entity10 , could be about to make an unlikely comeback - in digital form			1
the founder of @entity13 is capitalising on the success of e-books to launch a new company offering short stories , journalism and extracts from longer books , aimed at users of mobile devices			2
read @entity22 will use a subscription - based model to attract customers , prompting comparisons to @entity26 , but unlike the music streaming service it will be heavily curated in a bid to avoid a ' slush pile ' of mediocre material			1
@entity2 , 73 , has already revolutionised the @entity31 by introducing a national chain of high - quality bookshops for the discerning reader			1
now he hopes to do the same for the online world as well , re-introducing the art of the serialised novel and other neglected forms			2
as paperback books became increasingly common and affordable throughout the 20th century , short stories and long - form journalism fell in popularity			2
but now many people are believed to do most of their reading on tablets and e-readers while commuting on public transport , leading to a new hunger for more easily digestible reading material			0
' it worked for @entity10 and it worked for us , ' mr @entity2 told the @entity52			1
' if you are going to read on a laptop or a smartphone or a tablet , it is about as much as you want			0
' venture : @entity58 , which is launching in the autumn , will offer a curated service of short - form literature @entity10 and his peers , such as @entity63 , published most of their novels in serialised form via monthly magazines before issuing the complete hardback versions			1
the opportunities for cliffhangers provided by serialisation provoked intense public interest - famously , @entity72 flocked to the city 's harbour to meet the boat carrying the final chapters of @entity77 in order to find out whether the novel 's heroine @entity77 would survive			0
the material published by @entity58 will be closely scrutinised by mr @entity2 and his partners in order to ensure a high level of literary quality			1
' the whole point is to avoid a slush pile of material , ' he told the @entity88			0
' what we 'll guarantee is quality writing			0
' they hope to attract established authors with a pre-existing fanbase , but will largely publish new works which have not appeared elsewhere			0
@entity96 : @entity10 , pictured reading to his daughters at home , published his books in sections the service , which will open to subscribers in the autumn , is likely to cost around £ 5 - 12 per month			1
mr @entity2 , who founded the company that bears his name in 1982 and left in 2001 , has previously attempted to sell short fiction , but found it too difficult in the pre-digital era			1
his is not the only bid to reinvigorate the book industry in the face of competition from @entity114 and the supermarket giants			0
last month , @entity13 announced plans to include an extra chapter in the paperback edition of @entity120 ' @entity119 , the sequel to her best - seller @entity122			0
they hope the bonus offering will entice readers away from e-books and cheaper retailers .			2
