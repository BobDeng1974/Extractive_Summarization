@entity1 youngster @entity0 is set for a season - long loan move to @entity3 , with @entity4 his expected destination			1
the 21 - year - old , who is the brother of established @entity1 star @entity7 , has spent the last two seasons on loan at @entity11 side @entity10			1
he won the @entity12 last season and was close to breaking into the national team ahead of the @entity15			1
monchengladbach believe that they will secure his signature , with sporting director @entity36 telling the @entity37 : ‘ we were always going to make an attacking signing , no matter what the situation is with @entity41 and @entity42 , and this will be @entity0			0
‘ we have exchanged contracts with @entity1 and we have agreed with @entity0 , we have all agreed and now just need to sign the contracts			2
’ wanted man : hazard has attracted interest from a number of clubs in @entity3 and the @entity51 is he just there because of who his brother is ? not quite – it looked like a vanity move at first but the second of four footballing hazard brothers has impressed during a loan spell last season , leading him to this point			2
what has he done to show his potential ? he won the @entity25 player of the year award last season and narrowly missed out on a @entity15 squad spot behind @entity68			0
during his time with loan club @entity10 he was subject of a poaching attempt by @entity71 and even briefly was named club captain in a bizarre turn of events			0
will he ever make it at @entity1 ? it ’s proven difficult for anyone to break through at @entity78 after loan spells			0
@entity0 is still a long way from being a @entity82 star but @entity1 will hope this loan can act as a platform			1
