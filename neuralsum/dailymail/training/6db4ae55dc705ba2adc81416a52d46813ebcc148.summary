by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 11:04 est , 21 september 2013 innocent child : chance after chance was missed to save murdered four - year - old @entity4 , a report found today the former children 's chief who was blasted for failings by his former council over murdered schoolboy @entity4 has stepped down from his new child protection post			1
@entity11 retired as director of children 's services at @entity15 at the end of last month - and promptly took up up the post of independent chairman of @entity19 in @entity20			1
however , he has now decided to withdraw from the post of chairman of the @entity22 ' with immediate effect ' - just two days after the move was announced			0
the news comes the same week a serious case review into the death of four - year - old @entity4 found key opportunities were missed to intervene in his case by the city 's children 's services team , together with health professionals , school staff , police and other child protection agencies			1
@entity38 , @entity39 mp for the area of @entity15 where @entity4 and his family lived , said he was ' stunned ' when the news of mr @entity11 's appointment broke , which he claimed was ' an affront to public opinion '			1
he also called on the chief executive of the city council @entity49 , who this week apologised for the council 's failings , to state what he knew of mr @entity11 's appointment and asked whether the council provided him with a reference for the job			1
mr @entity38 had said he planned to raise the appointment with the government			0
today , a spokesman for @entity59 said : ' the new chair of @entity61 , @entity11 , has decided to withdraw from the post with immediate effect			2

@entity4 died of a head injury in march 2012 , after a systematic campaign of emotional and physical abuse by his mother @entity72 and brutal former soldier and stepfather @entity4 , both originally from @entity75			2
@entity38 , @entity39 mp for the area of @entity15 where @entity4 and his family lived , pictured left , said he was ' stunned ' at the news he was beaten , suffering a broken arm which needed hospital treatment , and arrived at school one day with two black eyes			1
he was also kept locked in a box room at home , fed salt , and starved to the point where he stole food from other pupils ' lunchboxes and raided school bins for scraps at playtime			1
despite these signs , the serious case review report authors found that nobody had ever spoken to @entity4 independently about his home life nor acted decisively to intervene in his care			2
it also found the child protection agencies had been taken in by the ' web of lies ' spun by @entity4 's mother and stepfather , and should instead have been ' thinking the unthinkable ' about what was really going on			2
the serious case review by @entity112 , published on tuesday , concluded the young boy had become almost ' invisible ' to the people who were supposed to protect children from abuse and recommended improvements to working practices , record - keeping and inter-agency communication			0
callous : @entity72 , the mother of @entity4 , and @entity4 , his stepfather of @entity4 battered him to death after subjecting him to systematic starvation and ' incomprehensible ' cruelty all agencies involved said they had learned lessons to avoid another case like @entity4 's happening again			1

mr @entity38 , who had previously called on mr @entity11 to resign despite reports he was already planning to retire , said : ' like myself , i am sure the whole of @entity15 will be stunned to learn that @entity11 , former director of children 's services at @entity15 has gone off to become chair of the safeguarding children board at @entity142			1
' this is a clear example of senior civil servants operating their own network for the benefit of themselves , at the expense of front - line staff who have faced the real challenges on a daily basis			0
' the appointment is an affront to public opinion and confirms that i was right to call for a wholly independent inquiry			0
' these boards are not truly independent			0
' schoolboy : @entity158 in @entity15 , @entity159 , where @entity4 was a pupil			1
he used to scavenge food from bins in the weeks before he died because he was so hungry he added : ' @entity49 , @entity15 's chief executive , should state publicly whether he knew of the appointment before it was made and whether he or any of his senior staff provided a reference for mr @entity11			1
' i shall be meeting with @entity166 , minister for children and families , in the near future and will raise this appointment with him as well as my concerns			0
' a @entity172 spokesman said : ' local safeguarding children boards are independent of government - appointments are made by the chief executive of the local council			0
' he added the minister had already met with the mp			0
a spokesman for @entity59 said : ' we can confirm that a new chair has been appointed to @entity19			0
' the multi-agency appointments panel sat in june 2013 and all appointment decisions are based on the merits of each applicant , their suitability for the post and information available at the time			0
' mr @entity38 has applied to have an adjournment debate in the @entity192 on the wider issues surrounding @entity4 's death			1

there have also been calls for a public debate on whether a change in the law is needed , placing a mandatory legal duty on anyone who works with children to report their suspicions of child abuse			0
local safeguarding children boards were introduced under the @entity211 and bring together representatives from health , education , social and children 's services and other agencies responsible for protecting children from the area where they operate , and are chaired by an independent person			1
the boards ' aims are to foster greater co-operation between the different agencies , leading to better joined - up working , improving the safeguarding and welfare of vulnerable children.another key role of such boards is to carry out serious case reviews whenever a child dies where there is a suspicion of abuse or neglect .			0
