by @entity0 they may look good enough to eat , but these images of realistic - looking meals are actually made entirely of lambswool			0
from the great @entity7 fry - up to a traditional roast dinner , art director and model maker @entity5 has recreated beloved classic dishes to scale - in a format not safe for human consumption			1
each tiny baked bean is individually sewn and yarn colour is alternated to show grill marks on meats , making the brightly - coloured reproduction dinners hyper - realistic , and also cartoon - like ; what a perfect diner advertisement might resemble			0
the @entity23 series is a knitted project by @entity25 with photographer @entity26 - the burger came first the project is a collaboration between ex-fashion @entity29 , 26 , from east @entity30 , and photographer @entity26 , 38 , from @entity30			1
aptly called @entity23 , the series aims to encapsulate the mood of the classic @entity7 caf√© , fast food joint and burger van - but with a woolly twist			1
the burger meal - ' fast food reimagined ' - was knitted first			2
it features individually knitted fries in a red chip box , a mounded burger bun encasing a beef burger , and meticulous detailing such as tomatoes , gherkins and floppy processed cheese			0
once the burger had been shot , @entity26 and @entity25 decided on the other dishes			1
they wanted to pick iconic dishes and thought , ' what 's more iconic than a full @entity53 breakfast ? ' , and recreated a classic fry - up form wool			0
for this one , @entity25 had to make lots of baked beans out of wool to scale - ' they took a while to make , ' she says , ' but were well worth it as they worked really well '			1
it features a cup of tea , toast , beans , tomato , egg , sausage , bacon with fat , mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale from representative multicoloured yarn			0
the @entity7 fry - up features a cup of tea , toast , beans , tomato , egg , sausage , bacon , mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale the next shot was the classic @entity86 hotdog			0
the pair muse that while it was the simplest dish to produce , it created one of the most graphic and striking images of the series			0
the hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a real one - and a pinkish hot dog with a yellow wiggly strip of mustard running down its length			0
while shooting the first shots in this series , @entity26 mentioned that he wanted to send out a @entity101 card and it would be great to make a @entity101 dinner			1
so @entity25 went away and created a full roast dinner out of wool			2
the roast came with all the trimmings , complete with woolly pigs in blankets - a must have at any @entity101 roast - @entity111 sprouts , carrots , cranberries , roast potatoes , gravy , and an entire turkey			0
the hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a real one - a pinkish hot dog and yellow wiggly strip of mustard both @entity26 and @entity25 have a meticulous attention to detail and their collaborative projects are very much a meeting of minds			1
@entity25 knits all of her woolly creations on her vintage domestic knitting machine and sculpts the foundations of the models by hand in her east @entity30 studio			1
@entity26 wanted the images to look like they were classic food photography , but on closer inspection turned out to be made of wool , so they styled the sets to be as real as possible			2
to help with the double take effect , @entity26 lit them in the same way he would light one of his shoots with real food			2
@entity26 and @entity25 are planning to have an exhibition in @entity30 later in the year showing all their woolly projects , complete with large scale photographic prints of the work and also the actual models @entity25 made for the shoots			1
the @entity101 roast dinner comes with @entity111 sprouts , carrots , pigs in blankets , cranberries , roast potatoes , turkey and gravy			0

@entity23 is project by director and model maker @entity25 , 26 , and photographer @entity26 , 38
pair plan an exhibition of their knitted projects in *october* or *november* in a @entity30 *gallery*
