the @entity1 has done more harm than good by paying too much for new drugs , health economists have warned			1
experts claim that paying over the odds for cancer drugs means the health service is being starved of money to spend on patients with different diseases			2
the money spent on expensive drugs would have done five times more good if spent elsewhere in the @entity1 , they claim			1
new research says the drugs rationing body is also approving drugs that are too expensive for the @entity1 to afford – despite rejecting dozens of other drugs on grounds of cost			1
the research found the ' threshold ' used by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) when gauging the cost - effectiveness of new drugs is too high			1
waste : the money spent on expensive drugs cancer would have done five times more good if spent elsewhere in the @entity1 , a damning report has claimed many believe the high prices of new drugs are justified because pharmaceutical companies need to recoup the cost of years of investment taken to develop them			1
but researchers at the @entity35 at @entity36 say @entity1 patients are losing out because the money could be better spent elsewhere , such as filling staff shortages or buying new radiotherapy machines			1
co-author professor @entity41 said ' the increasing pressure to approve new drugs more quickly at prices that are too high will only increase the harm done to @entity1 patients overall			1
' the political pressure to support a multinational pharmaceutical sector can not justify the real harm that has and will continue to be done to @entity1 patients			2
' the research comes as critics argue that cancer drugs have been given unfair priority in a cash - strapped @entity1			1
the government 's aim , which was a @entity54 election pledge , was to enable @entity1 doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit			2
it has led to around 55,000 patients in @entity60 getting drugs banned by @entity22 or awaiting approval since april 2011			2
the @entity1 ( @entity64 ) bill this year will be £ 280 million			2
patients not being given the expensive drugs are missing out , it has been claimed			0
instead , the money could be better spent filling staff shortages or buying new radiotherapy machines ( file image ) however , research by health economists at the @entity36 has , for the first time , estimated the impact of the drugs fund on other areas of the @entity1			1
it found @entity1 outcomes would be better if it refused to fund any drug that cost more than £ 13,000 per quality adjusted life year ( @entity81 )			2
the qaly is a complex formula used to calculate the cost - effectiveness of a drug – so - called quality adjusted life years ( @entity81 )			1
this determines the cost of a new treatment by working out how much it improves and extends a life compared with existing treatments			0
@entity22 uses a threshold between £ 20,000 and £ 30,000 per @entity81 , but on average it approves drugs that cost £ 40,000 per @entity81 and sometimes as high as £ 50,000 , according to the research			1
for every £ 10 million spent on a new drug that costs £ 40,000 per @entity81 , 250 @entity96 would be gained but 773 lost because the money spent would not be available for other services			1
the net harm would be 523 @entity96			0
the @entity1 spend this year will buy 4,098 @entity101 for individual cancer patients but the health lost elsewhere will be 21,645 @entity96 – five times greater , say the researchers			2
professor @entity106 said he did not blame drug companies , which were responding to a demand for innovative and expensive therapies , mostly driven by the @entity112 market			0
instead he said the @entity1 should refuse to pay excessive prices and either cut prices unilaterally or bring in a rebate scheme under which companies would reimburse the @entity117 for drugs that cost more than £ 13,000 per @entity81			1
professor @entity106 added : ' we need to find a way of setting prices that reflects the real value in the market			0
the key is to find a mechanism that can allow that to happen			0
' if for political reasons we have to have the @entity1 , at least we should be confronted with the results of that decision , ' he added			0
sir @entity131 , chief executive of @entity22 , said of the issue : ' the question is how to balance investing in the cutting edge of medicine with more routine care ' the research was funded by the @entity138 and @entity139			0
sir @entity131 , chief executive of @entity22 , said : ' the @entity1 has a choice about whether to use some of its money to adopt new things			1
' the question is how to balance investing in the cutting edge of medicine with more routine care			0
' ' unless you think that drug companies will be prepared to lower their prices in an unprecedented way , using a threshold of £ 13,000 per @entity81 would mean the @entity1 closing the door on most new treatments			0
' ' at the other end of the spectrum , we obviously ca n't just say yes to anything and everything			0
' we do n't have enough money and anyway , not everything is worth having			0
' and drug companies need the discipline of a critical market to make sure that price matters			0
' the research is published in the @entity166 journal .			0

money spent would have done 5 times more good if spent elsewhere
@entity22 is also approving drugs that are too expensive for the @entity1 to afford
this is despite rejecting dozens of other drugs on grounds of cost
' @entity177 ' used to gauge the cost - effectiveness of new drugs is too high
