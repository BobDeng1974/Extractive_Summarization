@entity1 walks away from his role as president of the @entity4 with a pension worth more than £ 100,000 - a - year , it emerged today			1
the @entity7 chief , who has opposed demands from @entity9 for radical reform of @entity12 migration , will enjoy the annual pay check provided he remains ' loyal ' to the @entity15 project			1
@entity17 mps condemned the ' greed and arrogance ' of @entity12 fat cats , and urged @entity21 to ' put them in their place '			2
mr @entity1 has repeatedly clashed with mr @entity21 , frustrating his attempts at @entity12 reform			0
in a farewell speech in @entity36 last week , mr @entity1 warned @entity9 's hopes of restricting migrant numbers would ' not be in conformity with @entity15 laws '			2
and on thursday it emerged that deays before he stands down , the @entity4 had ordered the @entity9 to pay an extra £ 1.7billion for its @entity12 membership			1
the @entity4 issued the demand after using rules dating back to 1995 and finding @entity9 's economy has grown faster than expected , so must pay a greater share to @entity7			1
to add insult to injury , @entity47 will receive a £ 790million rebate because its economy is struggling			0
furious mr @entity21 hit back insisting it was an ' appaling ' way to behave , and warned the move made it harder to justify @entity9 's membership of the @entity12			1
but mr @entity1 brushed aside the ' concerns in @entity36 ' and insisted ' sometimes these decisions do happen ' details of the remuneration of outgoing commissioners show the generous payments mr @entity1 can look forward to			0
he is entitled to an annual pension worth 4.275 per cent of the basic salary for every full year in office			0
his monthly salary of € 25,554.58 ( or £ 20,188.12 ) means his annual pension pot after 10 years in office will be £ 103,562			0
pension experts said someone paying into a normal pension would have to build up a pension fund worth £ 3.6million to secure such generous annual payouts			0
@entity17 mp @entity73 told @entity74 : ' this does n't surprise me			0
the @entity9 people are fed up with the greed and arrogance of unelected @entity12 fat cats like @entity1			2
' it 's time the @entity9 flexed it 's muscles and @entity21 took a lead in putting them in their place			2
' conservative @entity87 said : ' it 's a joke is n't it			0
all this does is add to the growing numbers of people who want to take us out of the @entity12			0
' what it looks like , and what it is , is an elite who pay themselves what they like , do n't listen to the @entity9 people and don ; t take decisions in the national interest			2
' mr @entity1 will also get a ' resettlement allowance ' of one month 's basic salary and ' travel expenses and moving costs are reimbursed ' , according to the @entity4 website			1
@entity21 has clashed with mr @entity1 over immigration and a demand for @entity9 to pay an extra £ 1.7billion a transitional allowance is also paid for three years , beginning on the day after leaving office			1
this allowance is between 40 and 65 per cent of his £ 242,000 annual basic salary , and is subject to @entity12 tax			1
the transitional allowance can be capped but only if he takes up a new job , and his new salary plus his allowance means he is earning more than a member of the @entity4			1
@entity122 , chief executive of @entity123 , told the @entity124 : ' it 's ridiculous that the @entity12 hands out lavish perks for ex-officials one day and then demands more money from @entity9 the next			1
' both voters and the business leaders who create jobs in the @entity9 will find president @entity1 's lecturing particularly grating , given that we 're paying him to promote the @entity12 for the rest of his life			1
' a spokesman for mr @entity1 said : ' all information on commissioners ' salaries and entitlements , including pensions , is public			0
we never do bespoke calculations , or check figures prepared by others when it comes to the precise remuneration or pension of named individuals			0
' the commission does not set the terms of commissioners ' salaries and entitlements ; the member states do			0

generous perks for @entity4 president as he stands down
also in line for a ' transitional allowance ' plus travel and moving costs
he will also get a month 's salary to help him adjust to life outside @entity7
comes after row for @entity9 to pay an extra £ 1.7billion to the @entity12
