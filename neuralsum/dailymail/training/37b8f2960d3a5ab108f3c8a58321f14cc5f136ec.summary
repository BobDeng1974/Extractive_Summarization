@entity9 's first minister will also attend other events organised by her majesty in @entity12 during the historic official visit by @entity15 president @entity14 to the @entity16 next week			1
the @entity18 politician , who refused to sit in the @entity19 as an mp because it required an oath of allegiance to the @entity2 , snubbed a gala banquet in her honour at @entity26 in 2011			1
last month , it was reported he was considering whether to accept the offer , but in a statement , @entity18 leader @entity30 confirmed mr @entity1 would be visiting @entity4			2
' while @entity1 's involvement in president @entity14 's state visit may not be welcome by opponents of change , it is yet another example of @entity18 's commitment to an inclusive future based on tolerance and equality , ' he said			1
' this decision may cause difficulty for some @entity15 republicans in light of ongoing difficulties in the north ( of @entity9 ) but i would appeal to them to view this positively in the context of republican and democratic objectives and the interests of unity and peace on this island			0
' a @entity58 spokesman said : ' there is a long - standing practice of not commenting in individual invitations			1
' that said , @entity2 is greatly looking forward to this historic state visit and welcoming all guests to @entity4			1
' the @entity2 met and shook hands with mr @entity1 in @entity66 two years ago , a gesture that would have been unthinkable just years earlier			2
host : the former @entity18 leader will also attend a number of events organised by her majesty in @entity12 mr @entity30 said next week 's state visit by the @entity15 president needed to be viewed against the backdrop of huge political changes over recent years			1
' @entity18 seeks a new and positive relationship between @entity15 - all of @entity9 - and @entity16 based on equality and mutual respect for the first time in our troubled history , ' he said			2
' we also seek an agreed , united @entity9 which accommodates those who define themselves as @entity16			0
' it is within this context that i can confirm that deputy first minister @entity1 will accept an invitation to attend all events as part of the state visit			2
' the queen is said to have taken a keen interest in the preparations for next week 's events - the first time an @entity15 head of state has been formally invited to the @entity16 by a @entity16 sovereign			2
opposition : @entity100 ( left ) said he ' would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting mr @entity1 to my home ' while mp @entity104 ( right ) said the invite was ' going too far ' the highly successful state visit to @entity9 by the @entity2 and the @entity106 in may 2011 paved the way for the latest milestone			1
in remarkable scenes , the @entity2 paid her respects to republican dead at @entity26 's @entity111 , visited @entity113 - site of the 1920 bloody sunday massacre - and made a widely praised speech on @entity117 history at @entity26			1
since then , a number of meetings between mr @entity14 - a former @entity120 government minister , a poet and academic - and members of the @entity123 have taken place			0
although the @entity15 head of state has travelled to events in @entity12 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 last year , these were not official visits			0
likewise , previous meetings between the queen and then - president @entity133 and her predecessor @entity134 at various functions in the @entity16 were not official state visits			0
' difficulty ' : @entity137 mp said he would feel ' very uncomfortable ' sitting next to him at dinner , but said it was a step forward in healing rifts between the two countries highlights of the visit will include an address the president will make to both houses of @entity147 - another first for an @entity15 head of state			2
the @entity2 will stage a traditional state banquet in honour of her guest at @entity4 , mr @entity14 and his wife @entity153 will visit the @entity154 in @entity155 and he will attend another major dinner at the @entity157 given by the lord mayor			1
@entity9 will be recognised with the @entity2 hosting a reception for leading figures from @entity162 's cultural , political and business life			2
conservative mp @entity137 said : ' whilst the man concerned has engaged in things in the past which have created appalling mayhem and tragedy , today we are looking at healing those rifts			0
diplomacy : the pair shook hands during a visit to the @entity174 in @entity66 in june 2012 ' i would feel very uncomfortable sitting beside him at dinner			0
i would have great difficulty doing that myself , but in terms of building a democratic foundation in @entity9 , i can understand why people feel this is what we need to do			0
' but would i want to sit beside him at dinner ? no , i certainly would not			0
' last month , when rumours of the invite emerged , there was a furious reaction by a number of politicians condemning the invite			0
@entity192 chairman @entity100 , who survived the @entity6 bombing of the @entity194 in @entity195 in 1984 which left his wife @entity197 paralysed , said : ‘ were i the @entity2 , i think i would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting mr @entity1 to my home			1
’ @entity201 mp @entity104 , a former @entity202 colonel who also served in @entity9 , said : ‘ the @entity6 was responsible for killing and injuring many of my colleagues and , while i fully appreciate the need for conciliation , i feel this invitation is going too far			0
’ a former @entity209 member , who was involved in @entity212 ’s long - running and costly @entity211 inquiry , said : ‘ the thought of this former @entity6 commander walking into @entity4 makes me feel physically sick			0
people should remember what the @entity6 did and how many innocent lives have been lost			0
