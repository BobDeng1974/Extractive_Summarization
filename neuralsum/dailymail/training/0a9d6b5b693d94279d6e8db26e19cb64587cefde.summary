by @entity0 published : 15:24 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 17:22 est , 10 october 2012 @entity1 was caught out providing @entity4 @entity3 officials inaccurate and inflated estimates of the number of its users and ultimately its worth just a week before the company 's disastrous ipo , it emerged today			1
a flurry of 12 letters between the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) and @entity1 depict a reluctant management team repeatedly playing cat - and - mouse over official requests to release figures and in the end being forced to withdraw information that was in reality guess work at best			1
most damning is the suspicion that @entity1 did not have accurate figures for the number of smartphone users who use its application and intentionally held back the real , significantly lower figures , until only a week before the $ 104 billion ipo on may 18th			2
scroll down for @entity29 amateurish : @entity1 ceo @entity30 speaks to the @entity32 conference on september 11 , 2012 in @entity33 this information has come to light after the dozen letters dating from february 1st through to may 17th , were published on the @entity3 's website 20 days after the company 's initial public offering			1
the contentious exchanges were over @entity1 ’s apparent failure to disclose the exact figures for mobile phone user growth , where they were geographically located , and how it planned to make money from them			0
this has led some analysts to conclude that @entity1 knew their valuation and business plan was n't watertight before launching at $ 38 a share and that the company should have postponed the public offer			1
' they were given the benefit of the doubt when they went public that they were ready for prime time , ' said @entity58 , a managing director at @entity59 ' they still have n’t proved that they are			0
' in the initial @entity9 filing from february 1st , the company said smartphone usage of @entity1 increased around the world and numbered 425 million ' monthly active users ' in december 2011			1
it accepted that it had n’t proven it could ' monetise ' individuals using only mobile devices , where the absence of ads may ' negatively affect our revenue and financial results			0
' the @entity3 asked for a ' more detailed ' analysis of these key challenges requesting to see the company 's plan b should their attempts to corner the mobile market fail - an eventuality which the @entity3 described as being ' disastrous			2
' replying on march 7th , @entity1 's lawyer @entity83 disclosed that @entity1 's mobile monetisation strategy could run up ' excessive expenses ' but still refused to number the users who ' primarily accessed ' @entity1 through their smartphone , saying they did n't have a ' reliable ' count			0
disastrous ipo : @entity1 ceo @entity30 speaks to the @entity32 conference four months after the firm 's shambolic share offering when asked by the @entity3 to locate geographically its users it said that it could n't do so reliably , because for instance @entity1 counted most blackberry owners as @entity97 because their servers are based in @entity97			1
this prompted the @entity3 to question whether @entity1 actually had 845 million individual users at the start of 2012 which the firm replied they believed was ' reasonably accurate			1
' they reveal a volley of messages between the commission , @entity1 's chief financial officer @entity103 and their law firm @entity104 and show that @entity1 was aware of many of the issues currently unnerving investors			2
@entity113 to these correspondence were the claims that @entity1 made on february 1st that their mobile figures were backed by audience share accounting firm @entity116 and highlighted their ability to utlilise the burgeoning smartphone market - on which advertisement 's are not as easily viewed as on a home computer or laptop			1
the @entity3 had to fight @entity1 tooth and nail on 92 points of information it wanted to see ahead of its may 2012 ipo @entity127 , an assistant director for corporation finance at the @entity3 was skeptical that @entity1 could deliver on these claims and questioned where they had drawn their figures from after the internet company cited respected @entity116 as their source			1
after an ultimatum for @entity1 to produce a @entity116 backed study , the social networking firm dropped the reference and admitted the claim was drawn from marketing materials only and subsequently ceased to mention them on february 28th - 27 days after it filed its proposal to go public			1
@entity143 has trawled through the letters and correspondence and noted they show @entity1 executives holding back crucial details which are only revealed when the @entity3 pushes for their disclosure			1
in one exchange , the @entity3 notes that @entity1 in some cases was counting mobile users twice and @entity127 wrote on march 22nd , ' please explain to us how you determined that your metrics are not overstated ? ' fallen since may : today 's @entity1 share - which is around 45 percent down on the $ 38 dollars it opened at in may furthermore , on may 9th , eight says before the ipo , @entity1 finally made clear to the @entity3 that daily mobile customers were increasing faster than the advertising revenue growth - thereby revealing a shortfall in the expectations of the much vaunted and imminent ipo			1
even though the exchanges are now months old , the issue is more relevant now than before , as the @entity162 , @entity163 based firm how counts one billion users worldwide			0
this is up from 845 million at the year 's start and of which the firm claims 600 million access @entity1 through their mobile device			0
since their disastrous ipo , @entity1 has dropped to almost a half of its offering price , amid concerns over its ability to monetise the growing mobile market			2
@entity175 : @entity30 on may 18th - the day of the @entity1 ipo other 's are just as critical			2
' we 've been growing increasingly skeptical of some of their monetisation methods , ' said @entity181 , an analyst at @entity182 to @entity183			0
what investors who bought up @entity1 shares in may did not have a chance to see until a month after the ipo were requests from the @entity3 that pushed @entity1 to disclose how they planned to deal with challenges they faced such as decelerating revenue growth , user count and its growing dependency to online gaming firm @entity194 current @entity3 policy is to not release any messages regarding @entity198 's until 20 days after the share float			1
however , the revelations that facebook itself was unsure of its own figures and busines plan has led industry experts to question why the ipo occurred at all			0
' when you have a significant change in your forecasts it 's good business practice to postpone the ipo so that the market has more time to understand what 's going on , ' said @entity211 , a finance professor at the @entity213 's @entity212			0
indeed , following the depth of the bungled ipo , the @entity3 is continuing to probe an ' in depth review of all the participants ' in the ipo said @entity3 chairman @entity218 in an interview in september			2
cleaning up : @entity1 's ipo has caused a mess that is currently being investigated by the @entity222 , two regulatory agencies and the state of @entity225 the @entity222 is also looking into the matter , and has held meetings “ with a range of involved parties including @entity1 , @entity230 , @entity231 ( @entity231 ) , and the @entity3 , ” said @entity232 , press secretary for the @entity222 committee , in an e- mailed statement to @entity143			1
so , while questions may be asked as to why the @entity3 allowed the @entity9 to go ahead , even with concerns , the heart of the matter is growing concern within the @entity3 over how it audits new high - tech consumer internet firms			0
among the 92 of concern that the @entity3 brought to @entity1 was the social networking giants reliance on @entity194 , which makes the five most popular games played on @entity1 , including ' @entity244			1
' at first @entity1 told the @entity3 that @entity194 accounted for 12 - percent of its 2011 revenue but after deeper questioning admitted that @entity1 made almost one fifth of its revenue through @entity194			1
in addition , the @entity3 had to force @entity1 to admit that @entity194 could end up becoming a competitor			1
' @entity194 may choose to try to migrate users from existing @entity1 - integrated games to other websites or platforms , ' @entity1 disclosed			0
hyped : the @entity1 ipo was one of the most widely - anticipated stock offers in recent history as a result , ' our financial results may be adversely affected , ' it said			2
all answers to the @entity3 from @entity1 were signed by @entity83 , 46 , of the @entity263 , @entity163 , law firm @entity104			1
the @entity3 also asked @entity1 why it had n’t included data on revenue generated by each user , a ' key ' indicator of performance			2
@entity83 dismissed the request on march 7 , saying that the company prefers to look at ' overall growth in users ' and ' overall revenue in evaluating the business			0
' undeterred , the @entity3 carried out their own calculations , which made @entity1 file the required figures			2
these showed revenue worldwide from each active user falling to $ 1.21 in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $ 1.38 in the fourth			0
they also revealed that per - user revenue was lowest in @entity281 , at just 53 cents down from 56 cents in the first quarter			0
company executives did little to help their cause among shareholders during @entity1 ’s first months as a newly public company according to financial experts			0
' there should be more public appearances by the ceo , there should be ongoing media relations activities that help give confidence to investors , ' said @entity295 a professor at @entity298 ’s @entity297 in @entity299 , @entity300			0
' i do n’t see any of that going on			0
i see the exact opposite			0

@entity4 @entity3 had to fight @entity1 on 92 queries it had regarding plans for its may 2012 ipo which it filed on february 1st
correspondence between the @entity3 and @entity1 show that @entity1 was unable or *unwilling* to share details of its business plan with the @entity313
