by @entity0 for those of you who have dogs that stress out when you leave home without them , you may feel you 've tried everything to comfort them			0
but have you tried lulling them into submission , say , with a song written by a grammy - award winning pop star ; conceived specifically for canine ears ? @entity14 , a member of @entity15 , the fizzy pop - rock band behind we are @entity17 , was asked to write the pet - soothing music by @entity20 , a popular multimedia network intended to ' relax ' and ' stimulate ' dogs when they are home alone			1
' i approached this composition project differently than i would for human ears , ' mr @entity14 said in a statement , leading @entity28 to test this curious concept on @entity30 , the highly - spirited chihuahua			1
that is , until any of her favorite people leave our apartment , at which point she throws herself at their ankles like a rabid squirrel and barks consistently for a solid five minutes , before trotting off to her bed without a care in the world , and settling down for a nice long nap			0
i 've tried various methods to ease her temporary distress , all without success ; so even though i laughed out loud when news first broke of mr @entity14 's concept , curiosity won me over			1
i did ponder , too , whether mr @entity14 was inspired to write this music as an ode to his band mate @entity60 , who was recently bitten by his girlfriend @entity61 's over-anxious dog , @entity63			1
ms @entity61 subsequently had @entity63 put on @entity64 to calm him down , and we can only guess whether she has experimented with this song too			0
back to @entity30 , and a few minutes before my roommate left for work this morning , i switched on the mellifluous tones of mr @entity14 's song			1
the music , for my ears at least , was lovely			2
smooth electronic notes punctuated with harps , and the sounds of scuffling and whispering wind			2
' i made sure the range of frequencies and instrumentation were tailored to a dog 's unique sense of hearing , ' explains mr @entity14			1
star power : mr @entity14 ( right ) wrote the tune for @entity20 , a multimedia network designed to keep dogs company when they 're alone , and says he approached this project ' differently than [ he ] would for human ears ' inspiration ? mr @entity14 's band mate , @entity60 ( previous photo , left ) , was recently nipped by his girlfriend @entity61 's dog @entity63 ( pictured ) , who was struggling with some anxiety issues @entity30 , however , could n't have been less phased			1
i eagerly trailed behind her , speakers held aloft as she ran chaotically from room to room , but to no avail			0
at one point , while she was taking a quick breather from her personal tragedy , the sound of gentle panting appeared in the song , and she turned her head towards the source of the sound quizzically , before letting out an almighty yawn			1
' i made sure the range of frequencies and instrumentation were tailored to a dog 's unique sense of hearing ' i took this to signal progress , and played the highly enjoyable music a few more times for both of us			2
since the yawn though , @entity30 had forgotten that she was supposed to be upset , and had taken herself off for her morning nap			0
the five minutes were up , and i doubt the music had much to do with it			2
i remain intrigued , however , by the concept of @entity20 , on which this sort of music plays on loop all day			0
cured ? pleasant as the song was , it did very little to interrupt @entity30 's daily separation - anxiety - induced meltdown the network claims to have done their homework on lonely dogs , stating on their website : ' through years of research with some of the world ’s top pet experts , special content was created to meet specific attributes of a dog ’s sense of vision and hearing and supports their natural behavior patterns			0
' the result : a confident , happy dog , who ’s less likely to develop stress , separation anxiety or other related problems			0
' at $ 4.99 a month for @entity154 subscribers , and $ 9.99 for its online streaming service , i imagine this material would , at the very least , soothe an owner 's separation - anxiety as they guiltily leave their homes every day			0
indeed , there is a small part of me that feels warm in the knowledge that it 's possible for @entity30 to kick back with some good music while i 'm gone , whether she notices or not			0
mr @entity14 is donating his fee to a @entity167 , a shelter in his hometown of @entity170 .			1

the piece of music was composed by @entity15 band member @entity14 , and *incorporates* gentle panting sounds
