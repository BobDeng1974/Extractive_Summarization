a single mom , @entity6 raised @entity14 alone in @entity15 , @entity16 , where she worked as a science teacher			2
it was a sign of the love and effort she put into everything , she said love : she respected @entity1 's decision to take her own life , saying it was her job to ' love her through it ' last week @entity14 cried in a parting message , describing the painful prospect of leaving her mother childless			1
but @entity6 insists she feels blessed to have the shared 29 years before her daughter contracted @entity36 multiforme - an aggressive tumor in her brain			1
' early on , i told her , " it would be my honor to take care of you , whichever way ; if you need to be fed or diapered , it would be my honor , " ' she said			0
' and that was important for me , for her to know			0
' ' she was a smart , pretty and charismatic little girl , so she asked to do a lot of things and she generally excelled at all of them , ' @entity6 reminisced to the @entity50			2
' if she took ice skating , she 'd excel at ice skating , ' she said			0

' today i chose to die with dignity ' : according to friends and family of @entity1 , she passed away in her @entity63 , @entity64 , home after her condition worsened on sunday			1

on sunday , she administered her lethal medicine and died in her bed at home in @entity63 surrounded by family			0
twenty years earlier , she was just miles away dreaming of weddings and playing with her friend			0
' she had a girlfriend , and she 'd make clubhouses in these shrubs â€“ dig under the shrubs and make little chairs and take out my silver - plated wedding gifts and bury them in the dirt , ' @entity6 said			2
in the years that followed , @entity14 went on to become a straight - a student at high school before enrolling at @entity105 then working in orphanages across south east @entity107			2
@entity6 said the prospect of her daughter traveling to @entity107 was frightening , and she was astounded by the way @entity1 dealt with the horrific situations she witnessed			1
even after contracting terminal cancer , @entity1 maintained @entity6 said : ' she 'd call me and say , " oh mom , it 's awful			1
" ' debilitating : a scan shows the glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months tearful : @entity1 wept days before her passing as she described the pain of leaving her mother childless ' she 'd try to get supplies and she 'd take them to the orphanage , but the supplies never got distributed , so my daughter went in there and demanded to see where her supplies were			1
' she said , " i want you to show me where you put the supplies i gave you yesterday			0
they are for the children			0
" ' ' she made them give them all back to her , and she took them into the room and gave them to the kids			0
' @entity14 said , in the weeks before her passing , her biggest regret is that she never got to have a family , having worked extensively with children			0
' i 'd say most of my sadness centers around how much i wanted a family , ' @entity14 told @entity148			0
however , the experience in @entity107 had a dramatic effect on @entity14 's perspective on life : ' she knows that even with her brain tumor , she 's still surrounded by love , ' @entity6 said			1
' she 's still surrounded by comfort and care , and there are societies where that it not at all ever the case			0
' now mourning the loss of her child , @entity6 said she will one day travel to @entity75 in @entity164			1
