on paper @entity1 ’s team sheet looked like an insult , one for the anti-football brigade to get their beaks into after @entity6 went without an orthodox striker			1
when reality bites , even his biggest detractors must concede that @entity6 ’s decision to leave @entity11 on the bench until the start of the second half was another tactical masterclass			1
@entity1 ’s manager is staying true to the game — his game — because the end result will be a fourth @entity21 title for this football club			1
@entity1 's @entity6 gestures on the sideline after going into the game against @entity25 without a striker @entity27 was part of a front three who interchanged roles during the first half to great effect for their boss at times you are left wondering what @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity27 make of it all when @entity6 starts working on team shape six days before a clash with @entity25			1
this trio have an element of fantasy about their game , with those delightful touches around the corner and the clever wall passes that they can play at will			0
the master simply wants results			0
to start without a striker , to ignore the collective groans around the country by starting @entity36 in a deeply withdrawn role behind @entity35 and @entity27 , was a statement of intent			2
@entity6 was forced into it , of sorts , because he has been deprived of @entity58 and @entity59 in recent weeks , and his warrior @entity11 could not train all week			1
even so , you would not put it past @entity6 — who pulled a similar stunt by playing @entity65 as a false nine at @entity66 last season — to have done it anyway			2
when it comes to work - rate , discipline and desire , no - one can accuse these players of cheating			0
everyone has a job to do in this team			0
@entity1 mastermind @entity6 surveys the pitch before kick - off having plotted out his game plans @entity35 leads a trio with @entity36 and @entity27 that has fantasy about their play but @entity6 wants function strikers @entity59 ( left ) and @entity58 are both working their way back to fitness with leg injuries to watch @entity35 , the @entity89 player of the year , @entity27 and @entity36 sacrifice their a-game for the greater good of the team demonstrates a unique commitment to @entity6 ’s methods			1
what happened to the style , the swagger and the pomp about the team who won so handsomely at @entity103 , putting five past @entity105 ’s side without reply at the @entity107 on january 17 ? they traded it for @entity6 ’s tactics , using the extra time during the week following their @entity113 elimination against @entity114 for match - specific preparation			1
with only one game a week since @entity1 went out on away goals on march 11 , @entity6 has used the time on the training field to prepare for @entity21 matches as a one - off			1
but @entity11 was available to @entity6 and he only used the @entity121 when @entity27 went off injured there is no question who had the upper hand in the managerial tactical battle , and it was n't wenger @entity36 was exceptional for his manager , pestering the @entity25 midfield when the @entity129 were without the ball @entity131 comes close after a ball into the box from @entity36 but is thwarted by @entity25 keeper @entity134 against @entity66 he deliberately conceded possession , suffocating @entity136 and waited to hit @entity138 ’s team on the break			1
they won 1 - 0 , even if it was far from pretty			1
here at the @entity142 , against a team with eight successive wins in the @entity21 , he bewildered their defence by allowing his front three to rotate			2
@entity36 was exceptional as he flitted across @entity25 ’s back line and pestered @entity149 and @entity150 when he wanted to win back the ball			2
the @entity153 forward engineered @entity1 ’s best chance , a clever angled ball in the first half that found the feet of @entity131 running into the box			0
@entity25 keeper @entity134 saved well			0
this was perfectly disciplined , if uncomfortable to watch at times as @entity6 looked on approvingly from the sidelines			0
when he was forced into a change at the break because @entity27 had been ferried to hospital with suspected concussion following his collision with @entity166 , he turned to the experience of @entity11			0
@entity27 soars high in pursuit of the ball as @entity134 comes out quickly to intercept the pair clashed with @entity166 considered lucky to be on the pitch after viewing the replays @entity27 was substituted at half - time having not recovered from the blow with @entity166 at the age of 37 he served his team - mates well in the second half , chasing 60 yards towards his own goal at one point to stop the forward run of @entity183 down the left			0
towards the end of the second half , as this game gravitated towards its inevitable conclusion , @entity1 relied on their captain @entity188 ’s leadership skills to see it home			0
a year ago this team was experimental , with various formations on trial as @entity6 assembled his next title - winning team			2
here at the @entity142 , it has finally taken shape .			0

@entity1 played out a 0 - 0 draw with @entity25 at the @entity142 on *sunday*
@entity6 started with no striker despite having @entity11
his tactics were not pretty but of *deserving* @entity21 champions
@entity36 gave perhaps his best *performance* in a @entity1 shirt
