it is likely that @entity1 will captain @entity2 when @entity3 leaves at the end of this season			1
a tunnel tear - up with @entity7 has been advanced as evidence of his new - found steel			0
‘ if he becomes captain he will carry it with great honour , ’ said @entity2 manager @entity10			2
he is certainly much improved , yet @entity1 is sorely lacking a quality that can never be taken for granted			2
he has three goals this season			0
@entity3 , in his comparative dotage , has nine			0
@entity1 has just 16 goals in his entire @entity2 career , dating back to 2011			1
in that same period , @entity3 has 42			0
it is likely @entity1 will captain @entity2 when @entity3 leaves at the end of this season @entity1 ( right ) and current @entity2 skipper @entity3 share a joke during thursday 's training session @entity1 captained @entity2 during the @entity27 ' 0 - 0 draw with @entity28 at @entity29 in the @entity30 on saturday @entity1 argued with @entity31 's @entity7 at @entity29 during tuesday 's @entity32 semi-final both are central midfielders , both regarded as leaders within the group			1
yet time and again , @entity3 has used his position and influence to conjure a vital result for his club			2
@entity1 is yet to prove he can do that			0
saturday ’s draw with @entity28 was another example			1
@entity3 was rested , @entity2 drew a blank			1
nobody filled his shoes , certainly not @entity1			0
let ’s face it , @entity2 would n’t even have made it this far without @entity3			1
had @entity10 rested him against @entity51 , they would probably have fallen at the first			0
when @entity3 is on the pitch , one always feels @entity2 have a chance			1
@entity3 scored twice as @entity2 defeated @entity51 in the third round of the @entity30 earlier this month anyone can have a row with @entity7			1
if we do n’t hear about too many tunnel confrontations involving @entity3 it is probably because we are too busy celebrating his brilliance on the pitch , or one of his match - winning goals			0
@entity3 ’s captaincy is about so much more than pulling on an armband			2
he leads by example , but also by deed .			0

@entity1 captained @entity2 during saturday 's draw with @entity28
former @entity71 midfielder expected to take @entity3 's captaincy
@entity1 is yet to show his *ability* he can influence results like @entity3
