by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 4 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:13 est , 4 february 2014 a tanning addict who used a sunbed every day for three years was left with a horrific scar after a massive tumour grew on her face			1
@entity8 , 33 , spent an hour each night - six nights a week - under the tanning bulbs in her spare room			1
after more than 900 hours on a sunbed she gave up the habit in favour of fake tan lotion and kept out of the sun to avoid wrinkles			2
@entity8 , 33 , developed skin cancer after overusing a sunbed			1
she needed 29 stitches after she had the 5p - sized tumour removed from beside her nose but the damage was already done and in january last year doctors discovered a tiny spot on her face was cancerous			1
surgeons were forced to cut a chunk out of her cheek leaving her needing 29 stitches			2
she now has a huge scar from her eye to her mouth			2
ms @entity8 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ‘ i was confident about my looks before my surgery			1
‘ now , at 33 , and with a lifelong scar stretching most of the way down my face , i am reminded daily that my vanity backfired			2
‘ the scar will fade slightly but i will always be left with a mark			2
ms @entity8 ( pictured before she developed the tumour ) said : ' i think i just felt at the time it was n't doing any harm because it was n't the sun , which of course is stupid ' ms @entity8 started using a sunbed when she was 18 and eventually had one in her spare room ‘ i am desperate to get the message to young girls , teens and even ladies my own age that sunbeds are simply not worth the risk - i know that now			1
’ the radio presenter first hired a sunbed for two weeks ahead of a holiday to @entity66 when she was just 18			2
basal cell carcinoma is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer			1
these are skin cancers that develop slowly in the upper layers of the skin			2
they are more common than melanomas which spread quickly around the body			0
the first sign of the tumour is usually the appearance of a lump or patch of skin that does n't heal			0
in most cases , cancerous lumps are red and firm while cancerous patches are flat and scaly			0
basal cell carcinoma starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and account for about 75 per cent of skin cancers			1
the exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be linked to overexposure to uv light			0
the chance of developing the cancer is higher in people with a family history of the condition , in people with pale skin and in those with lots of freckles			1
the condition affects about 100,000 new patients in the @entity108 every year			0
surgery is the most common treatment			0
source : @entity112 she then spotted one in the classifieds section of her local newspaper for £ 50 and snapped it up , spending half an hour on each side every night except sunday			0
she gave up the sunbed in her early 20s - but unbeknown to her , the damage was already done			1
she first noticed a tiny spot on her left cheek near her nose in 2010 but dismissed it after a doctor said it was nothing more than a little scar			1
but the blemish grew and after two people commented on it she went to see another doctor in january last year			1
after a quick look with a magnifying glass , he announced it was a skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma - caused by exposure to uv rays			1
ms @entity8 , who is single , said : ‘ i felt sick , absolutely sick			1
‘ they kept saying to me you must sunbathe , but i do n't - i 'm very vain and i do n't like my freckles and i do n't want wrinkles			0
‘ they kept saying it was very rare for someone my age to have this and that certainly did n't make me feel any better			0
‘ it was only when the fifth or sixth person said about the sunbathing that i suddenly remembered about the sunbeds			0
‘ i loved the feeling of the warmth on my face and it made me feel healthy			0
‘ i think i just felt at the time it was n't doing any harm because it was n't the sun , which of course is stupid			0
’ surgeons at @entity161 in @entity162 cut out the tumour - about the size of a 5p - and the surrounding tissue in two 30 minute operations in june			0
ms @entity8 , who was only under local anaesthetic , said : ‘ i could see them there , peering down at me as they cut it away , and i could smell the flesh burning as they stopped the bleeding			1
ms @entity8 was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma - skin cancer that is caused by exposure to uv rays - after developing a spot on her face ms @entity8 ( pictured after her operation ) used a sunbed daily for three years between the ages of 18 and 21 but stopped using them when she was in her early 20s ‘ it was horrid - really , really horrible			1
‘ it felt like it was massive on my face and they were just cutting and cutting			0
‘ there were times when it felt like it was really brutal as they were cutting the roots out and i was left with a lot of bruising			0
‘ when i finally took a peak under the bandages it was awful			0
‘ i looked like something out of a horror movie - it truly looked like special effects make up			0
’ ms @entity8 says she worried her scar would damage her confidence but that she is coming to terms with it two days later , surgeons patched up the gaping hole in her face by stretching the surrounding skin			1
but they had to slice her face from just below her eye to her mouth , to give them enough skin to create a flat scar and avoid puckering			2
ms @entity8 said : ‘ it was horrible			2
the shallow side of me thought i looked horrible and i 'm single and nobody in their right mind is going to want to date someone like that			0
‘ i thought this is going to kill my confidence and i 'm not going to be able to do anything			0
’ ms @entity8 says she would encourage other young women to use fake tan instead of sunbeds ms @entity8 said : ' i was confident about my looks before my surgery			1
now , at 33 , and with a lifelong scar stretching most of the way down my face , i am reminded daily that my vanity backfired ' but ms @entity8 is coming to terms with her scar and wants to persuade tanning addicts to ditch the harmful habit			1
she said : ‘ there is no point and no excuse for going on sunbeds , especially with all the self - tan products out there now			2
‘ i know first - hand how damaging it can be			0
‘ i feel fine 90 per cent of the time and it is amazing how you can just forget about it , but it is always going to be there			0
’ ms @entity8 now wants to warn other people of the dangers associated with using sunbeds			1

@entity8 used a sunbed for an hour every day for three years
she stopped using sunbeds in her early 20s but the damage was done
in 2010 she noticed a spot on her cheek but a doctor said it was a scar
in january 2013 she saw another doctor after it continued to grow
this doctor diagnosed her with basal cell carcinoma - a type of skin cancer caused by exposure to uv rays
