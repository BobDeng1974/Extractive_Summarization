striking firefighters : members of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) in @entity10 and @entity11 will walk out for five hours from noon on may 2 , between 2pm and 2am on may 3 , and then between 10am and 3pm on may 5 firefighters staged a series of strikes last year in protest at plans for a later retirement age and other changes to pensions , which they said do not take into account the unique nature of their occupation			1
@entity32 , @entity9 general secretary , said : ' after three years of negotiations and an intense four months presenting an indisputable , evidence - based case for the need to ensure a pension scheme that takes account the unique occupation of firefighting , the government is still burying its head in the sand			1
' several members of @entity33 were only too keen to praise firefighters during the winter floods , but their words amount to nothing when they simultaneously ignore issues that threaten the future of firefighters and their families			2
' nevertheless , we remain totally committed to resolving the dispute through negotiation , and are ready to meet to consider a workable proposal as soon as possible			0
' @entity32 , @entity9 general secretary , said the government was ignoring issues which pose a threat to firefighters and their families the last strike was on january 3 , since when talks have been held in a bid to break the deadlock , while the union has met with the conciliation service @entity63 outlining its concerns and ' frustration ' at the lack of progress			1
the union wrote to the government earlier this month setting a deadline of today for an improved offer			0
the @entity9 executive unanimously decided to call more strikes			1
the union maintains that firefighters face the threat of being sacked ' merely for getting older ' , as well as having to pay increased pension contributions			1
@entity9 members voted by four to one last year in favour of strikes			1
fire minister @entity82 said : ' by calling unnecessary strike action , the @entity9 has shown it is not serious about finding a resolution to this dispute for its members and stands only to further damage firefighters ' standing with the public			1
' the government has met with the @entity9 on many occasions , most recently during april , and has remained in ongoing communication to find a solution			1
only yesterday , i wrote to the @entity9 saying proposals are still under consideration and stressed the importance of maintaining an open dialogue on this and other matters			2
' the deal on the table gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector , and the proposals protect the earned rights of a higher proportion of members than any other public sector scheme			2
' nearly half will see no change and even firefighters who are not protected will see no change until 2015			0
' under the new scheme , a firefighter who earns £ 29,000 will still be able to retire after a full career aged 60 , get a £ 19,000 - a - year pension , rising to £ 26,000 with the state pension			0
an equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much			0
' catch a fire : members of the @entity9 approach the gates to @entity125 during their march and rally to @entity127 , @entity128 ahead of their strike last october london fire commissioner @entity130 said : ' today 's announcement from the @entity9 for fresh strike action is regrettable			1
in @entity135 we will , of course , have contingency arrangements in place but just as before we will be asking people to take extra care to prevent fires from starting			0
' we will be doing all we can to remind them to take care when cooking , to make sure cigarettes are disposed of properly and to check their smoke alarms are working , especially over the bank holiday period			0
' during the strikes , 27 engines will be deployed at strategic locations across @entity135 and will be used to provide fire cover for the capital			0
' the contingency fire service is provided by a contractor and is not intended to replicate the @entity155 's normal operational cover arrangements			0
the contractor will provide basic firefighting and some rescue work			0

members of the @entity9 will walk on may 2 , may 3 and may 5
they are fighting proposed changes to pensions and retirement age
@entity9 maintains members face threat of the sack ' merely for getting older '
