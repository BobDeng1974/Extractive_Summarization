the @entity0 are ready to tighten the rules on @entity3 player quotas to ensure that players like @entity7 midfielder @entity6 and @entity9 goalkeeper @entity8 would not in future qualify as ‘ homegrown ’			1
in a bid to boost the @entity12 team , the @entity0 will look at reforming its quota system , which currently states that eight of the @entity0 ’s 25 - man squad have to be homegrown			1
the rules are so lax that any players who have completed three years at an @entity3 club before the age of 21 are deemed homegrown — regardless of nationality			1
@entity6 is deemed ' homegrown ' because he spent over three years at @entity9 before turning 21 that has led to the farcical situation of @entity7 and @entity9 having @entity6 and @entity24 listed among their homegrown players and @entity27 having @entity28			1
had @entity27 signed @entity29 from @entity30 in january , he would also have qualified as homegrown within a few months as he had spent more than two years at @entity32			2
increasingly , clubs have copied @entity9 ’s model by poaching the best young @entity36 talent at 16 to bring them to their academies and ensure they qualify as homegrown under current rules			2
@entity0 chief executive @entity42 acknowledges that the rules , implemented as part of the @entity0 ’s @entity45 ( @entity45 ) for youth football , need a fresh look			0
‘ it will get looked at , ’ said @entity42			0
‘ we welcome foreign players , we welcome the best of foreign talent if we can get hold of it and therefore clubs do n’t want to go down a route that restricts their ability to recruit that talent			0
on the other hand , clubs recognise they ’re making a huge investment in these youth systems and they have to produce results			0
@entity65 goalkeeper @entity8 also came through the ranks at @entity9 @entity28 moved from @entity67 to @entity9 at 16 and is now one of the few ' homegrown ' players at @entity27 ‘ clearly @entity45 has gone through what i call its development phase ; it ’s gone through its hardware phase , with its facilities and its pitches			2
now it ’s in its software phase , which is concentrating on outcomes			0
and outcomes must be getting players through the system and through into the first team			0
there will be a point in the next number of months where we will say , “ is it now time to have a look at that ? ” ’ @entity42 concedes that the idea of homegrown quotas was not implemented so major clubs could simply bypass young @entity3 players to bring through the best players from the rest of @entity94 , but he can not promise what rule changes will be implemented			1
‘ you ’ve asked me a question : do i think it will be looked at ? do i have any view as to what the outcome will be on any details of that ? no i do n’t			0
‘ we ’ll sit with 24 academy managers in a room and talk it through and make sure the whole thing is done with their expertise and knowledge			0
’ @entity111 midfielder @entity29 joined @entity112 side @entity30 a few months before he would have qualified as ' homegrown ' as he had spent more than two years at @entity32 ( below ) if the @entity0 were to change rules so a young player has to spend three years at a club before 18 to qualify as homegrown rather than before 21 , it would almost immediately eliminate the ‘ @entity6 issue ’			1
players would then have to be at a club from 15 — and young players are not allowed to move across national boundaries , even @entity124 boundaries , before 16 unless there are exceptional circumstances , such as their parents moving country for work			1
clubs can not be told to employ only @entity3 players as that would be a breach of @entity124 competition law .			2

@entity0 teams must have eight homegrown players in squad of 25
any player who has completed three years at an @entity3 club before the age of 21 are deemed ' homegrown '
@entity0 want to change age to 18 as young players are not allowed to move across national boundaries until they are 16
