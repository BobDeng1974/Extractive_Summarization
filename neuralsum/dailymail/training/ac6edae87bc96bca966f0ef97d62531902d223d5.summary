by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 10:30 est , 28 january 2013 sunbathing in her family 's cottage garden on a glorious day in july , @entity4 , felt happy and content			1
two months before she had given birth to her son @entity8 and she and her husband @entity9 loved being first - time parents			2
' life was wonderful , ' @entity4 told @entity12			1
' we were blessed by becoming pregnant very quickly			2
i had always wanted to be a mother , so i was overjoyed that it was a reality			2
' yet within a month , the 29 - year - old from a @entity19 suburb was close to death after suffering three terrifying seizures in hospital - and it could all have been caused by that afternoon out in the summer heat			1
happy and healthy again : courtenay with her son @entity8 , who she was too weak to hold during her illness @entity27 had developed a rare auto - immune condition called dermatomyositis			1
the condition , which affects only one in 100,000 people causes painful skin rashes , muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing			1
it can kills up to five per cent of people who get it			2
but when mrs @entity4 first started to develop a purplish rash on her chest both she and her doctors were stumped			1
' i first thought it was sunburn but it had spread and become very itchy , ' she recalls			2
' i went to a dermatologist who ran tests and they thought it might be lupus ( where the immune system attacks healthy cells ) but they were n't sure			1
' ' then one evening i tried to pick @entity8 up and nearly dropped him because my arms were so weak			2
i went to numerous outpatient departments and every doctor ran blood tests , but they all came back negative			2
' mrs @entity4 sunbathing after giving birth to @entity8 in july 2011 , just before it triggered a terrifying autoimmune condition at its worst mrs @entity4 could n't swallow and had to be fed through a tube			1
her hair fell out during treatment mrs @entity4 was finally diagnosed with the muscle condition at @entity63 after rheumatologist dr @entity64 noticed a scaly rash on her knuckles - a typical symptom of the disease			1
@entity27 's immune system was mistakenly attacking her own healthy tissue so she was put on a course of steroids to suppress her immune system			1
at first , the mother - of - one began to improve although she said she still felt like she ' had cement in every limb			1
' but a week later she took a dramatic turn for the worse			0
her eyes became swollen and she found she could n't swallow			0
' it was very scary			0
i had already lost a lot of weight and i did n't know what would happen next , ' she said			0
' i did n't want to do too much research as i was afraid of reading worst case scenarios			0
thankfully my parents lived nearby and could look after @entity8 , while my husband worked and took me to hospital			0
' mrs @entity4 was admitted back into hospital in october 2011 after tests revealed she had extremely high blood pressure			1
this had been triggered by a rare reaction to the steroids she had received to suppress her immune system			1
it was when she was talking to her husband in her hospital room that she had her first of three terrifying seizures			2
' i remember feeling light - headed and then the tv seemed to swirl in front of me , ' she recalled			1
' i said : " @entity9 , something is terribly wrong , help me , " and then i blacked out			0
' brain scan : the september image shows areas of swelling in the brain , which were caused by extremely high blood pressure			1
the image from november shows the brain after the condition had been resolved mrs @entity4 's chest starting to heal after she suffered an @entity113 infection from scratching the rash on her chest minutes later she had a second seizure and was rushed to intensive care where she had her third episode			1
her husband could only watch and wait to see if she would recover			0
@entity119 is a rare inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive purpley - red skin rash			1
it is an auto - immune disorder , which means the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue			1
the exact cause is unknown			0
the condition affects one in 100,000 people but is twice as common in women than in men			2
it can occur at any age but usually affects adults aged 40 - 60			2
the main symptoms are ... : rash across the face , eyelids , knuckles , elbows , knees and chest			0
: @entity142 muscle weakness involving muscles closest to the trunk , such as hips , shoulders , upper arms and neck : difficulty swallowing and weight loss it is treated with anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids and drugs to suppress the immune system			1
the condition can disappear on its own in about a fifth of patients			2
most patients survive but may be left with weakness and disability			2
in around five per cent of cases it can progress quickly leading to death			0
' the doctors told me that if i had had a fourth seizure i could have been left with severe brain damage or even died , ' mrs @entity4 said			1
an mri revealed her high blood pressure had caused lesions to form on her brain , which had triggered the seizures			1
thankfully , after three days she began to recover			0
as her strength slowly returned the mother was checked ' from head to toe ' to see whether she was suffering from any other conditions such as cancer , but these all came back clear			2
it was then that doctors revealed what they thought had caused her ordeal - a simple case of sunburn back in july			1
' that afternoon when i had enjoyed laying out in the sun the temperature was in the 80s ( @entity188 )			0
i had put sunscreen on but coming inside i remember i was a little pink , ' she said			0
research shows that when your skin is exposed to ultraviolet light it may cause many of your skin cells to die			1
these dead cells are powerful stimulators of the immune system , and in mrs @entity4 's case may have caused her body to overeact			1
' amazingly they said that was what could have triggered it , perhaps also because my immune system was low from after having my baby			1
it just seemed so incredible			0
' mrs @entity4 was put on an @entity208 - a blood product chock full of immunoglobulin ( antibodies that fight disease ) taken from the plasma of hundreds of donors			1
' i got so much better after that , ' she said			0
' i had spent my first week in @entity217 , then my second week out in a normal ward although i could n't eat food without help or move myself			0
' by the third week i was in the rehabilitation section			0
i was sitting up in my chair and could go to the bathroom with help			0
' the day i could eat on my own they brought me a piece of chocolate cake			2
' rehabilitation : mrs @entity4 with the chocolate cake she was given the first day she was cleared to eat by herself again ( l ) and ( r ) in a wheelchair on the day she was discharged from hospital out of hospital : @entity27 , her husband @entity9 and son @entity8 lived with her parents for a few months while she regained her strength mrs @entity4 left hospital in a wheelchair and bought a wig as her various treatments had caused her hair to fall out			1
she started physio exercises while staying with her parents			0
' before long i was dressing myself and although i needed help with @entity8 i could pick him up again , which was just wonderful , ' she said			0
but she still had an emotional battle to fight			0
' i had felt very depressed when i became ill as i could n't look after @entity8 , ' she said			0
' and after i left hospital i was very anxious that i would have another seizure			0
' when she went back to the hospital six weeks later she was thrilled to be told her lesions had gone and helped her to focus on getting better			0
' the last year has been wonderful , ' she said			0
' my husband , son and i moved back from my parents to our own house , my hair has grown back and a few months ago i started working part time in a gift shop			0
courtenay back at home with her husband @entity9 and son @entity8			0
she was wearing a wig in this photo after suffering from hair loss mrs @entity4 is now working part - time at a gift shop and says her illness has given her a new positive perspective on life ' i also wrote a book about my experience			1
i realised that i could connect with other people from talking about my own battle and hearing what other people had gone through			0
it gave me a new perspective and i really appreciate what i used to think of as chores			0
' although i 've had a few skin flare - ups i 'm learning how to manage the stress that can cause them			1
' @entity27 's biggest joy is that she can look after her son again			0
' @entity8 is 18 - months - old now and is very energetic , but i can keep up ! ' she said			2
' just over a year ago i could n't see any light at the end of the tunnel , now i appreciate the peace and joy a new perspective has given me			2
' @entity4 has written a memoir called ' @entity292 : feeling @entity294 's hands through his life - changing plans			1

@entity4 developed very rare condition where her immune system attacked her cells after a day of sunbathing
experts believe her immune system *overreacted* when ultraviolet light caused some of her skin cells to die
condition caused skin rashes and extreme muscle weakness
mother from @entity19 suffered life - *threatening* seizures after a rare reaction to a drug treatment caused her blood pressure to *rocket*
