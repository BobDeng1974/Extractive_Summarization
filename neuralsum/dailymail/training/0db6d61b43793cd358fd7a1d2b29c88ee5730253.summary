by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 09:17 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 15:34 est , 13 january 2014 a tap water ban in @entity5 is slowly being lifted on monday as officials fear the system could be overwhelmed after hundreds of thousands of people went five days without clean water			1
some 300,000 residents of @entity11 had their tap water poisoned last thursday when company @entity14 ' alleged shoddy safety practices led to a chemical spill into the water supply			1
it has also emerged that @entity14 has worked largely without regulation or environmental inspection for more than two decades			1
governor @entity20 told a news conference on monday that the ban is being lifted in a strict , methodical manner to help ensure the water system is n't overwhelmed by excessive demand , which could cause more water quality and service issues			1
officials cautioned the water could still have an odor , but they said it was safe			0
over the weekend , water tests reportedly showed that levels of the licorice - smelling chemical 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol were consistently below a toxic threshold , and in some samples , there was no trace of the substance at all			1
however one homeowner showed just how toxic and flammable the water still was on sunday by setting on fire a glass poured from his kitchen tap			0
questions were now being raised as to how and why the leak occurred and whether @entity14 took too long to let state officials know about the problem			2
work continues around a storage tank with the chemical designation @entity65 , 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , the chemical that leaked into the @entity31 , at @entity14 storage facility in @entity11 the facility largely flew under the radar of government regulators who viewed it as a low - risk operation - but in reality , a problem at a key holding wall went undetected and unreported at @entity79 the chemicals stored at @entity82 's facility near the @entity31 are not considered hazardous enough by regulators to prompt routine inspections			1
as a result , the chemical storage terminal was a low priority for regulators , who must pick and choose how to allocated scarce manpower when enforcing environmental laws			0
' i think that the loophole that this facility fell into is because it was not a hazardous material , it flew under the radar , ' said @entity97 , cabinet secretary of @entity5 's @entity98 , which enforces environmental laws			2
before the chemical leak last week , environmental inspectors had not visited the @entity14 site since 1991 , the @entity100 reported			1
@entity82 's storage terminal holds millions of pounds of chemicals - including some used in coal processing - just a mile and a half upstream from pipes that take in water for a public drinking supply			2
the distance left little opportunity for chemicals to dilute in the event of a spill			0
and those chemicals were stored behind a brick - and - concrete block dike that seems to have had structural problems - an issue the company apparently was aware of			2
a state official says the president told regulators that @entity82 had put $ 1 million into an escrow account to fix the wall that ultimately failed to hold thursday 's spill			2
state environmental officials would not have seen the dike problems - they say they never had reason to inspect the site			2
although regulators never visited , it appears company officials were aware of issues with the containment dike			0
@entity14 president @entity136 told state regulators that $ 1 million was put into an escrow account to repair the wall , said @entity140 , the @entity98 's director of emergency response and homeland security			1
@entity144 officials have not returned calls seeking comment on the condition of the dike			0
' the wall is an old cement block wall , and there 's some problems with the mortar in a couple places , @entity140 said			0
' and it came out through that			0
' a resident of @entity11 , @entity5 sent a glass of tap water on fire to show the level of toxicity from a chemical contamination a @entity11 couple conducted a water experiment where they were able to set it on fire following its contamination with 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol - which is used to clean coal during the water ban , some people had put plastic bags around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant			1
water distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home			0
so far , only ten people exposed to the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital , and none were in serious condition , @entity190 and human resources secretary @entity189 said			1
the chemical , even in its most concentrated form , is n't deadly			0
however , people were told they should n't even wash their clothes in affected water , as the compound can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting and diarrhea			2
other than schools , day - care centers , hotels and many restaurants were still closed on monday , the region was open for business but foot traffic was slow			0
stores and offices adjusted by providing bottled water and hand sanitizer			0
state government offices were open on monday			0
@entity219 , who helped the illness - plagued town of @entity221 , @entity222 win $ 300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she will lend her expertise in @entity5 the contamination disaster began with a smell last thursday when residents of @entity11 began to complain of a licorice - like aroma in the air , one that seemed most potent near the town 's water treatment plant			1
for an unknown period , a chemical called 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol used in the @entity5 's prevalent coal industry had been gushing into the @entity31 , a waterway from which @entity5 's largest water treatment plant sources its water			1
about 7,500 gallons of the chemical are believed to have leaked into the water supply from a one - inch hole in a storage tank			1
lawyer @entity219 , famous for her class - action suits which target the corrupt practices of big business , announced on her website last week that she and her team are headed to @entity11 , to investigate the cause and possible implications of the chemical spill at @entity14			1
coal miner 's widow @entity252 of @entity254 , @entity5 made clear that she did not blame the coal or chemical industries for the spill ' when things like this happen , we respond accordingly , ' ms @entity219 told the @entity261			1
' people have contacted us who are concerned , and itâ € ™ s certainly a scenario that concerns us			0
i mean , there are 300,000 people without water right now			0
' after fixing the immediate problem of finding drinking water , @entity219 said it must be determine what lasting affects @entity5 's leak will have on its children , ecosystem and wildlife			1
it 's the same process she took beginning in 1993 when she began her quest in @entity221 , @entity222 where @entity280 helped sicken an entire town following a serious and subsequently concealed release of dangerous @entity283 into the town well water			2
the detrimental health effects of chromium 6 are well studied , however the compound the poured into the @entity5 river last week is not nearly as well understood , especially at the extreme levels released during the leak			0

@entity293 slowly being lifted in @entity5 , governor @entity20 told a news conference on monday
town of @entity11 , @entity5 had drinking water poisoned after a ruptured pipe at @entity14 last thursday
as much as 7,500 gallons of toxic chemical 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol spilled into @entity31 , near the state 's largest water treatment intake
chemical company @entity14 has had no environmental inspection since 1991
company ' knew that the structure holding chemical had problems '
only ten people exposed to contaminated water have been admitted to hospital and none were in a serious condition
