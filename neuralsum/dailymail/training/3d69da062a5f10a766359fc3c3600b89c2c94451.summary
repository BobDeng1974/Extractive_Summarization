miss @entity13 , a mum - of - three , said : ‘ i did n’t see what happened , i turned around and he was on the ground , face down on the floor			1
‘ i thought the horse had caught his face because his face had gone to the side and down but we ’ve been told it was actually caused by a mild stroke			1
‘ he was having a seizure , he was fitting so much i tied him to me			2
‘ i was panicking and i did n’t know what to do , whether to keep him still or run him away from the horse who was just standing there eating the grass			0
‘ he looked lifeless after the fit had died down			0
‘ he was pouring with blood , it covered my coat from collar to bottom when i carried him			0
‘ it was terrifying , i honestly thought @entity1 was dead			0
it ’s disgusting someone could leave a horse in a children ’s play area			0
my son could have been killed			1
’ the horse was startled after @entity1 - a pupil at @entity86 - and friend @entity87 , seven , went to retrieve a football			2
shocking : @entity1 had a three hour operation to stop his skull piercing his brain - surgeons drilled a hole in his head to relieve pressure miss @entity13 said : ‘ the horse went up on its back legs and kicked the back of @entity1 ’s head			1
‘ @entity1 was lying face down on the ground and started fitting so i rushed over to pick him up to move him away from the horse			0
i was in such a panic , i could n’t believe what was happening			0

i was also told that because he had the seizure he could be prone to epileptic fits			2
a horse , similar to the one that kicked @entity1 , tethered in a public area very close to his home in @entity19 better : @entity1 has made a remarkable recovery after almost being killed when he was kicked in the head ‘ he had five fractured bones			0
he had a severe bleed throughout the operation and that ’s why it took so long			2
‘ i was told not to expect him to come out of it and if he did he could be paralysed - that he might not be able to walk , talk or feed himself again			1
‘ thankfully he seems to be making a good recovery so far , but he may need to have a metal plate inserted in his head			0
‘ i ’m sure whoever ’s horse this is knows this has happened and i want them to know the damage it ’s done			0
’ @entity1 , who is on antibiotics , will need to go in for regular check - ups and may need a metal plate in his head later in life			2
miss @entity13 , who has two other children , @entity153 , seven , and @entity154 , three , said : ‘ he is only on antibiotics			1
i ca n’t believe how well he is			0
but we still have to be very careful , i have to sleep with him and go to the toilet with him			0
‘ i do n’t think he really knows what happened , they say the fit wiped his memory which is good because he wo n’t have any flashbacks or dreams about it			0
he just thinks he had a nasty accident			0
’ before the accident : @entity1 is lucky to be alive after the terrible accident which could have left him paralysed			0
