published : 10:25 est , 24 june 2012 updated : 15:03 est , 24 june 2012 speaking out : @entity0 has said that her ' evil ' mother deserves to spend the rest of life in prison for the murder of two of her children the eldest daughter of child killer @entity9 has said her ' evil ' mother deserves to spend the rest of her life behind bars			1
a @entity16 court this week found the 45 - year - old guilty murdering of her children , 11 - month - old @entity13 and @entity14 , five , days after her partner was arrested on suspicion of raping @entity0 as a child			1
now ms @entity0 , 23 , has told how she can not bring herself to look at pictures of her mother , who ran away to the @entity22 with paedophile tv hypnotist @entity23			1
now , having waived her right to anonymity , the brave victim has revealed to the @entity26 how her mother holds her responsible for the children 's deaths			1
ms @entity0 told how she survived 11 years of sickening sexual abuse by her 46 - year - old stepfather , who hanged himself in prison in january			1
his crimes came to light only after ms @entity0 reported him to the police , fearing her young half - sister might be subjected to the same torture			1
she even wanted to adopt the girl to save her from their mother 's lover - who , dna evidence shows , wrongly believed the murdered youngsters were his			1
months after @entity23 suffocated her children , ms @entity0 said , she wrote to a relative to claim her eldest daughter was to blame for the killings			1
she said she felt relief at this week 's conviction as @entity23 continues to believe her sick partner was innocent			0
@entity23 , who used to manage @entity55 's children 's department , is to serve 34 years for murdering her sleeping son and daughter at the @entity60 resort 's @entity58 in may 2010			2
@entity61 : @entity9 in court in @entity63 , @entity16 , where she was found guilty of the double murder she and her partner had fled to @entity16 while he was awaiting trial for raping ms @entity0			1
police finally caught up with them and extradited @entity23 to @entity69			0
days later , @entity14 and @entity13 were dead			0
their half - sister told how she felt some degree of relief that @entity14 did not survive to face the torment she herself went through			0
and she harbours no sympathy for @entity23 , adding : ' i am glad mum will spend her final days in jail			0
she can think about what she 's done every moment of every day			0
' this coldness is perhaps understandable , considering the years of suffering she endured while living with her mother and stepfather			1
she told how she despised @entity23 from the moment he came into her life , following her parents ' divorce when she was six			0
ms @entity0 told the mirror of his overbearing ' presence ' , his fiery temper and how he would beat her and her brother with a slipper - all of which their mother ignored			1
the family moved house several times throughout ms @entity0 's childhood , gradually cutting her off from friends and relatives			2
then in may 1995 , after they moved to a remote farm in the @entity105 , @entity23 began his 11 - year campaign of horrific abuse			1
ms @entity0 , who was just seven at the time , told how he had just sent her brother to bed the first time he raped her			2
she said : ' he told me to stand in front of him			0
he said i was a " big girl " and i needed to " do dares now "			0
even at that age i knew it was wrong			0
' she faced this nightmare once a week - always when her mother was n't home - and afterwards her only comfort was the thought that she was safe for another six days			2
@entity23 , who would make a point of raping the terrified girl on his birthday , even tried to use his supposed powers of hypnotism to put her into a trance			0
scared that he would become angry if he saw that this never worked , ms @entity0 played along			2
later , the family hit hard times and moved into a caravan , where @entity23 told ms @entity0 he had thought about killing all of them - and that her mother shared these homicidal instincts			1
final days : @entity0 cherishes these holiday pictures of @entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) shown shortly before they died			2
her relief at @entity23 's arrest was shattered by the news of their deaths she told the @entity26 : ' part of me felt it would have been easier if they had , as i would have been free of him			0
but when i look at what happened to @entity146 and @entity13 , i was lucky to escape			0
' when ms @entity0 was 15 , @entity23 found out her mother was pregnant with @entity14 and confessed to the girl that he wanted to marry her and even father her children			1
the teenager began to dread a life trapped with this monster , and when her half - sister came along she was determined to protect her			0
ms @entity0 doted on @entity14 , calling her ' my baby ' and telling how she would look after her as if she were her own child			2
@entity23 , on the other hand , was strangely indifferent , and ms @entity0 recalls the time the baby fell off a bed while in his care - only for @entity23 to chastise the teenager for not rushing to the screaming child 's aid			1
she said her stepfather would try to prey on her while @entity14 slept , and so she made sure to keep the infant on her lap. tormentor : @entity23 regularly raped ms @entity0 over the course of 11 years relief finally came when ms @entity0 went away to study nursing at university			1
she was free , but fears for her younger half - sister plagued her mind - and she used a secret mobile number to check with her brother @entity174 that @entity23 had n't turned on @entity14			0
it was while studying that ms @entity0 befriended a fellow rape survivor , who helped her to recognise the seriousness of what she had been through			2
@entity174 was thrown out of the family home when he was 16 , and ms @entity0 thought this meant there would be no one to step in if their stepfather attacked @entity14			1
she approached the police in november 2007 , begging them not to arrest @entity23 until she had told @entity174 and her mother about what he had done to her			0
but when she finally broke her silence , @entity9 accused her of lying , disowned her and walked away			0
that was the last time ms @entity0 and her brother had any contact with their mother , who ran away to @entity195 with @entity23 in december 2007			1
it was there that @entity13 was born , though ms @entity0 only learned of his existence when police tracked the couple down			2
her relief at @entity23 's arrest soon turned to anguish as , less than two weeks later , she heard @entity14 and @entity13 were dead - killed by their mother , who feared social services would take them from her as her partner 's child abuse trial approached			1
ms @entity0 spoke of sleepless nights spent visualising @entity14 's cruel death , unable to come to terms with the fact that - after her worries about @entity23 - it was her mother that harmed her half - siblings			1
today she is a mother herself and lives with her husband in @entity217			0
one of her biggest regrets is that , despite her mother 's fears , she could have raised the murdered children and stopped them being taken into care			0
holiday pictures from @entity14 and @entity13 's final days act as a poignant reminder for ms @entity0 , and she plans to visit their graves in @entity16			2
but as their mother continues to stand by her perverted dead partner , she says her only hope is that @entity9 appreciates the pain she has caused .			0

@entity0 , 23 , waives right to anonymity and reveals how her mother stood by as she suffered 11 years of sexual abuse from step - father
