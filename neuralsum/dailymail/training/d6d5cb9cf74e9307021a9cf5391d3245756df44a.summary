@entity0 is one strong woman			2
she 's lost her mother , father and husband to cancer but is more determined than ever to continue her advocacy work to push for further medical research in @entity7			1

@entity0 with her mother @entity14 , who died of ovarian cancer in 2001 ms @entity0 , 49 , with her father @entity16 on his 81st birthday this year			1
he lost his battle to prostate cancer in october ms @entity0 's journey began in 1997 when she learnt that her mother @entity21 had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer			1
devastated by the news , ms @entity0 and her sister @entity24 dealt with their grief by pouring all their energy into creating an organisation that might one day prevent other families from feeling the same sense of loss			1
' we thought mum was okay because she had a partial hysterectomy so when we were told she had ovarian cancer , it had a detrimental effect on our family , ' she told @entity39			2
' when you 've lost someone in your life , you try and make sense of it and we did this by setting up @entity46			0
' we did n't want other families to feel robbed , just like we had been			0
' her mother lost her battle in 2001 , the year ms @entity0 officially co-founded the organisation with her sister			1
the 49 - year - old dedicated her time into building a support network for cancer victims , their families and also establishing a national day to raise awareness of ovarian cancer			2
but in 2009 ms @entity0 's world came crashing down , yet again			2
her husband , @entity61 , had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer			1
the @entity13 mother - of - two with her husband @entity61 , who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010 ms @entity0 says her husband 's death took a massive toll on her two children who were very young at the time of his passing ' i literally fell on the ground when i found out , ' she said			1
' how do you explain to your 9 - year - old - son and 13 - year - old daughter that their dad has a five per cent chance of survival ? ' at the time she was the ceo of her organisation but made the decision to step down from her role to care for her ill husband , who died in 2010			2
an immense sense of loss was also felt by her two children @entity90 and @entity91 , who are now 18 and 15			0
' my husband was only 52 when he died and my daughter was his princess and my son was just figuring out what his dad was all about , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' our children had to watch every day as their father grew weak and skeletal			0
there was no hiding from pancreatic cancer			2
' the suffering for our family did n't end there			0
the grief and loss felt by our children has been so extensive , four years on they still do n't understand			0
' since then , ms @entity0 tirelessly continued her efforts into volunteering for the @entity111 to underline the importance of consumer involvement in the medical research process			1
she 's also become a board member of @entity7 @entity117 @entity116 ( @entity118 ) to be part of the process of medical research and ensure better outcomes for women going through treatment			0
but most recently , in october , ms @entity0 's lost her father @entity125 to prostate cancer			1
' @entity127 was an integral part of my life and my children 's lives especially after @entity61 died , ' she said			0
' my father was an amazing person and very protective of us			0
it was a difficult loss			0
' @entity0 receiving her @entity10 from the chair of @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity137 board member @entity139 ms @entity0 was recognised for her advocacy efforts in the ovarian , gynaecological and pancreatic cancer research having suffered a triple tragedy , the award recipient has no intention of slowing down her advocacy work - even after being honoured at the annual @entity11 on wednesday night			1
but she 's adamant that she 's still , after all , human and is still quite evidently dealing with her loss of her three loved ones			0
' how do you cope with so much loss unless you know it 's not been in vain ? ' she said			0
' i 've lost my mum , my husband and my father			2
all i can do is look forward and continue to make sure that cancer research stays relevant			2
' ms @entity0 hopes to see a change in the medical world , which will make a difference to future cancer victims and their families			1
' i do n't want to see men and women being struck down by the disease - emotionally and physically , ' she said			0
' if we have the right support , cancer diagnosis does n't have to be a death sentence			0
' ms @entity0 was recognised for her advocacy efforts in the ovarian , gynaecological and pancreatic cancer research last night and was ' absolutely thrilled to have won the award '			1
' i believe that consumers have a strong voice in research to benefit future generations , ' she said .			0
