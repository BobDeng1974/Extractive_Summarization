a meeting with @entity1 stirs youthful memories in @entity3			1
he once wore the famous black - and - blue jersey and dreamed of emulating @entity5			1
that fondness for this giant of @entity8 could have been cemented when he almost joined their ranks barely into his teens			2
on thursday , however , he would simply love a chance to play his part in cutting them down to size			1
@entity3 is on a scoreless streak dating back to november , when a goal against @entity18 was his 11th in his first 12 games for @entity20			1
@entity3 trains ahead of @entity20 's @entity22 clash with @entity1 at @entity23 the @entity26 , on loan from @entity25 , has been replaced by @entity27 as @entity29 ’s first - choice striker			1
but he revealed a return to potent form against @entity1 would carry special significance			1
‘ they ’re one of my favourite teams , ’ @entity3 told @entity34 newspaper @entity33			1
‘ when i was little , i supported @entity1			2
i had the shirt , too			2
i ’m @entity26 , and @entity5 ( @entity5 ) was in @entity1 , so i was at @entity38 for him			1
‘ once i nearly even joined @entity1 , i was about 13 , i was taken to @entity1 and trained there			2
i also played a bounce game against a former club legend , @entity40 i think			0
’ while @entity1 may have been a source of inspiration in the past , @entity3 will look to his current surroundings at @entity23			1
a 60,000 sell - out will give the 22 - year - old a long - awaited taste of the stadium at its best			0
@entity49 games drawing barely half that number simply are n’t the same			0
@entity3 ( right ) revealed he liked @entity1 as a child , and in particular @entity5 ( left ) to @entity3 , harnessing the power of their support will be crucial as @entity20 seek to overcome @entity1 in the first leg of their @entity22 last - 32 tie			1
the striker has plentiful respect for the talent at @entity61 ’s disposal , yet is confident @entity20 will stand up and be counted			1
‘ @entity1 are a very strong team , ’ he said			2
‘ ( @entity63 ) @entity62 is great , i played against him in the @entity66 - @entity65 match			0
‘ @entity67 has great technique , and the same is true of ( @entity70 ) @entity69			0
‘ they fight from start to finish , but to come to us and win is not easy			0
‘ @entity23 will be sold out — 60,000 people			0
‘ for me , if you take the fans away from football , there ’s nothing left			0
‘ players come and go , but they ( the fans ) spend their money to follow the team year after year , and demand only one thing : passion			0
’ after a brilliant start at @entity20 , @entity3 has struggled for goals in recent matches @entity3 also paid tribute to @entity61 , who he previously worked under at the @entity92			1
the respect is mutual as the @entity34 spoke recently of his admiration for the forward ’s talents , having handed him a first - team break five years ago			0
‘ i have a lot to thank @entity61 for , he gave me my debut in the first team and advised me to go to @entity66 ( on loan ) , ’ @entity3 added			2
‘ he was right , i had my best season in the @entity105			0
‘ i see he has spoken about me recently			0
‘ he ’s different class , just like he was as a player			2
’ @entity3 was ineligible to play in the @entity22 group stage , so any minutes against @entity1 would provide a chance to showcase his talents against a higher level of opposition than found in @entity113			1
the @entity1 players , including @entity115 ( centre ) , train ahead of thursday 's match it might also attract further interest in his services			1
his city contract expires at the end of the season and talks about a longer stay at @entity20 have been postponed for the time being			2
@entity3 insisted he has no idea about his next destination but revealed that @entity1 were not the only @entity34 club to want him in the past			1
‘ at the end of the season i ’ll be a free agent , with no contract , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m a @entity20 player now , it ’s impossible to say where i ’ll end up			1
‘ @entity132 ? i was close to @entity133 ( doria ) , i trained with them at 15 , in the @entity135 ( youth squad ) once and in the first team once			0
it was the team with ( @entity139 ) @entity138 and ( @entity141 ) @entity140			0
‘ i liked everything , then ( @entity144 ) @entity143 brought me to @entity25			0

@entity20 play @entity1 in the @entity22 on thursday night
