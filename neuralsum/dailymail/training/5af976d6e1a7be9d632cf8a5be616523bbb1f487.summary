by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 6 october 2013 @entity1 could move to end the ancient tradition of swearing on the @entity3 to tell the truth in court			1
instead , witnesses and defendants would pledge not to lie without mentioning @entity8 – and could be jailed if they are caught out			1
critics say the controversial plan would undermine @entity13 ’s @entity12 heritage			1
oath : magistrates are considering scrapping the tradition of swearing on the @entity3 to tell the truth in court @entity19 , which represents 23,000 lay magistrates , will this month discuss concerns that many people do not take the oath seriously			1
if its policy committee approves the changes it will draft proposals to send to the @entity27			2
@entity28 , 62 , a @entity29 magistrate who proposed scrapping the oath , said : ‘ more and more i see people shrug their shoulders or say “ whatever ” when asked to take it			1
‘ i ’m suggesting we take holy books out of the process			0
instead , people will have to show they understand they could be sent to prison if they do n’t tell the truth			0
' i do n’t intend my motion to make any comment on religion			0
it is certainly not anti-religious			0
’ there is already an option for non-believers to take a secular oath , while those of other faiths can swear on their own holy texts			1
but church leaders warned that the measure would be seen as eroding the country ’s @entity12 foundations			1
the @entity56 @entity55 , former @entity57 , said : ‘ this could be the slippery slope towards the increasing secularisation of society			0
where will it end – with the @entity64 ? ‘ the @entity3 is bound up with the constitution , institutions and history of this country			0
it is right for people to have a choice of oath , a religious or non-religious one			2
‘ but we are being urged , in the name of tolerance and secularisation , to restrict that choice			0
’ significant : the @entity56 @entity55 , a former @entity57 , said the @entity3 is bound up with the institutions of @entity13 the @entity80 , director of communications for the @entity81 , added : ‘ given that the last census showed almost 60 per cent of respondents self - identified as @entity12 and two thirds as people of faith , this proposal seems to ignore the statistical reality that we remain a faithful nation			1
‘ this kind of proposal seems driven more by blinkered campaigning agendas than abiding interests in justice and truth			0
’ @entity97 , @entity98 mp for @entity99 and a magistrate until last year , said : ‘ this smacks of political correctness gone mad			0
’ legal expert @entity103 said : ‘ it would be unacceptable for the choice to take a religious oath to be removed			2
’ for hundreds of years @entity12 witnesses have been required to hold the @entity3 and state : ‘ i swear by almighty @entity8 that i shall tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth			1
’ followers of other faiths are given copies of their sacred texts with , for example , @entity118 swearing on the @entity119 and @entity120 on the @entity121			0
under mr @entity28 ’ proposal , the holy books would be removed and the oath would read : ‘ i promise very sincerely to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth and i understand that if i fail to do so i will be committing an offence for which i will be punished and may be sent to prison			2
’ a @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ we have no plans to change the arrangements for swearing an oath or making an affirmation in court , which have worked well for many years and still do			2

the body could scrap the ancient tradition in *favour* of a new promise
witnesses and defendants could instead swear not to lie - and accept they could be jailed if they do
critics say scrapping the oath would undermine @entity13 *'s* @entity12 heritage
