by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 5 march 2013 a @entity2 dad - of - two went on trial in @entity4 today over the holiday drowning of an @entity5 16 years ago			1
kitchen fitter @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , faced a jury accused of pushing @entity10 to his death during a pleasure boat booze cruise in november 1996			1
@entity10 , 21 , from @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity15 , died after falling from a boat called @entity17 off the @entity19 resort of @entity20 in an incident originally written off by @entity4 police as an accident			1
trial : @entity6 , pictured left in court yesterday , denies pushing @entity10 , right , to his death over the side of a pleasure boat in @entity19 1996			1
the trial began on monday , 17 years after mr @entity10 died in the dock : the incident was treated by officials as an accident for nearly two decades state prosecutor @entity34 , calling for mr @entity6 to be jailed for 12 years if convicted of killing the apprentice builder , said : ' towards the end of the trip as the boat neared port and the defendant was with a young girl at the stern , @entity10 stumbled drunkenly towards them			1
' the defendant said to the girl , " shall i throw him overboard ? " and then , without giving the girl time to reply and with the clear intention of ending @entity10 's life , he bent down , grabbed @entity48 by his legs at knee - height , stood back up and threw him over the side , fully conscious of his state of drunkenness			2
' all this occurred in a matter of seconds , without @entity10 being able to act			2
' blaming the delays in getting the case to trial partly on the fact a @entity2 eye witness only started incriminating mr @entity6 a year after @entity10 's death , she said : ' this has been a long process but bearing in the mind the difficulties we have had i believe this has been an example of perseverance in the face of a serious crime which could not be forgotten			1
' this was n't just any day , it was the day on which a boy aged just 21 died			0
' agony : the victim 's father @entity81 was in the @entity19 courtroom to watch the trial fight : @entity84 and @entity85 have been seeking justice for their son 's death for 17 years @entity10 's campaigning parents @entity84 and @entity91 were among those in court			1
they held hands as lawyers for both sides put forward their versions of the last moments of their son 's life on november 7 1996			0
his body was found by another vessel two hours later			0
the state prosecutor said @entity10 , who was enjoying his first sunshine holiday , was in a ' serious state of ethylic intoxication ' after an afternoon of drinking games on board @entity17 and was unable to react to mr @entity6 's ' sudden and surprise attack			1
' defence lawyer @entity111 told the jury of five men and four women his client had sought to save the dying man after an ' unfortunate accident			0
' he said the court would hear from a single ' contradictory ' eye witness now claiming his client pushed @entity10 after giving five statements in @entity4 and the @entity2 insisting she saw him fall and mr @entity6 was the only person who threw the drowning man a life ring and try to jump in the sea to help him			1
he told the court : ' we 're not here today because of the prosecution 's perseverance			2
we 're here today because of an obstinacy i would say was cruel			0
' in my opinion , mr @entity10 's death was a tragic accident , not the work of another person and certainly not the result of @entity6 's actions			1
' return : mr @entity6 voluntarily returned to @entity4 to stand trial and could face 12 years in prison hearing : proceedings opened on monday after a long - running legal battle over mr @entity10 's death mr @entity6 returned to @entity4 voluntarily to stand trial			1
he was extradited to @entity4 in 2005 after a botched @entity4 police investigation which saw just five of the 45 @entity2 and @entity5 tourists on the booze cruise questioned in the aftermath of mr @entity10 's death			1
an investigating judge charged him with homicide after having him extradited from @entity2 in 2006 - and then allowed him to return to the @entity2 on bail pending a full probe			0
homicide , a charge that does not exist in @entity155 law , is a halfway house between manslaughter and the more serious charge of murder which in @entity4 is a wilful killing which must also be premeditated			2
mr @entity6 , protesting his innocence from the witness stand during cross-examination , told the court : ' it was n't me that threw @entity10 overboard			1
i was the only person that went to help him			0
' i threw a life ring to him and i was taking my shoes and t - shirt off to jump in after him when the guy arranging the party games stopped me			0
' asked by the state prosecutor why he thought @entity172 , one of two sisters on board albatross due to give evidence against him tomorrow , is now accusing him of pushing the dead man , he said : ' it 's something i want to find out as much as you do			2
i do n't know either			0
' blaming inconsistencies in some of his statements on poor translators , he added : ' the translator i had in @entity185 after i was extradited was @entity186 and did n't speak proper @entity187 or @entity4			2
she just nodded her head a lot			0
' the duty lawyer they gave me was drunk			0
' @entity10 died after falling from the @entity193 off the coast of @entity19 , pictured mr @entity6 has voluntarily returned to stand trial on homicide charges in @entity19 mr @entity6 's trial followed an exhaustive 16 - year - campaign by @entity10 's builder father @entity84 , 60 , and his @entity5 mother @entity91 , 59 , to get answers to his death			1
they had to exhume his body 10 months after his burial when evidence came to light casting doubt on the original ruling his death was an accident			0
an investigating judge in @entity19 shelved the case against mr @entity6 three times - only to bring charges against him after repeated appeals by the couple 's lawyer @entity214			1
mr @entity214 retired in 2007 - and both he and @entity10 's parents only found out by chance today 's trial had been scheduled			1
the @entity219 have become grandparents five times since the death of their son - and mr @entity6 has become a father twice with his 16 - year - old daughter now studying for her gsces			2
speaking outside court today out - of - work builder mr @entity10 , who moved with his family to @entity230 from @entity231 when @entity10 was 13 , said : ' it 's mixed feelings at the moment			2
' we 're over the moon on the one hand			0
we 'd given up on things ever getting this far after so many kicks in the teeth and we 've been pinching ourselves the last few days to make sure it 's true			0
' but we 're also disgusted it 's taken so long			0
we 've been treated like dirt by the @entity4 authorities			1
my son deserved better than this			0
' as well as demanding a 12 - year jail sentence for mr @entity6 if convicted of homicide , state prosecutors also want him to pay his alleged victim 's family € 120,000 ( £ 104,000 ) in compensation			2
the trial , expected to last three days , continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
