mr @entity10 , an experienced lawyer based in @entity59 , told jurors that he became aware of problems in the probate of his mother 's will in 2011 during a conversation with family lawyers			1

' i discovered during the course of this discussion that all of my mother 's bank accounts were effectively empty - there was no money left , ' mr @entity10 told the court			1
' i learned that all the money in those bank accounts had been transferred out to a joint e-saver account			0
' the account was opened in the name of @entity16 and my mother 's name was subsequently added on august 7 2009 as a joint account holder			1
' they told me that all of the money in all of the accounts had been moved on and then , over a long period of time , had been taken out and gone into @entity16 's current account			2

' the court heard that @entity10 ' father @entity124 set up a number of trusts in 2002 a couple of years before he died			2

i admit on occasions i found her very difficult to deal with but i did n't hate my mother			0
' @entity23 , 53 , allegedly resented being left to look after their ailing mother @entity12 when his brother @entity41 moved to @entity145 and then @entity59 with his career			1
he began to siphon off cash from her estate and continued for some time after she passed away in november 2010 , it was said			0
despite organising her funeral and liaising with his brother about probate @entity10 also neglected to reveal he had wound up a number of trusts and settlements and cashed in two life insurance policies , before pocketing the money			2
a court heard he also failed to tell authorities his mother had died , giving him full access to her bank accounts and trust funds for some time after her death			0
the family estate should have been split equally between @entity10 and his brother but he transferred the cash into a joint account , set up between himself and his mother , then moved it into his own account			1
the cash was then handed to pay off former partners as well as ' loaned ' to him to pay for the redevelopment on a property he owned in @entity199 , it was said			0

mrs @entity68 ' health deteriorated dramatically after a fall at her home in @entity230 , @entity231 in 2009 and she moved in with @entity10 and his wife in @entity30 , @entity31			2
@entity10 told the court he had a very different relationship with his mother than his brother @entity16 following their father 's death in 2004			1
he said : ' she would say to me @entity16 never expresses his feelings , he never tells me he loves me			0
' i would say " but @entity16 does things for you and that is how he expresses his love "			0
' if i 'm honest about this period , and it was a very difficult period , is that up until 2008 @entity16 was doing the kind of fixing			2
' he would do the tax returns , he would sort practical stuff out			0
' but i was the one she spoke to , i was the one i think she would see as the emotional support , we would talk about her feelings and the future			0
' @entity15 , pictured , heard that @entity10 , who moved to south east @entity150 had a ' difficult ' relationship with his mother after the death of his father @entity124 in 2004 he added : ' i think it would be fair to say that prior to that i did n't have a particularly close relationship with my mother			1
' we all loved each other and we were close but it was not a situation where there would be daily or even weekly phone calls or visits			0
' when i moved to @entity145 contact was inevitably even less , obviously when you are 6,000 miles away you are restricted in terms of visits but i would always visit when i was back in the @entity277 , but that was sometimes an annual event			0
' the court heard following his father 's death @entity16 began to look after his mother 's affairs , with brother @entity41 rarely having any input			1
instead the brothers exchanged a handful of emails about the tasks , and when their mother had a fall in 2009 @entity41 admitted contact became ' even more sporadic '			2
' i took some comfort from the fact she was living with @entity16 and @entity20 and had somebody looking after her , ' he said			2
' rightly or wrongly i probably had less contact as a result because i thought she was being looked after			0
' over that period , a period of quite dramatic change in her physical and mental appearance , it was difficult to talk to her by telephone			0
' i made contact in december and she was quite engaged			0
' looking back i think @entity16 made it quite difficult for me to speak to mum over that period			2
' even at that time my sense was that my phone calls were in a sense orchestrated by him			0
' the court also heard that @entity41 pushed for his mother to move into sheltered accommodation after feeling she had ' no bond with @entity16 '			2
he told the jury : ' i will regret to the end of my life i was not more forceful that mum should have gone into sheltered accommodation			0
' i now know things we 're going on in terms of her finances , but at the time i was not critical of @entity16 it was a really difficult situation			0
' but the relation between them had broken down and it was simple about caring for her physical needs			0
' mr @entity10 and his wife deny all charges			1

@entity10 expected to get half of his mother 's £ 1.5 million estate
he said he was ' shocked ' to discover just £ 350 left in his mother 's account
