@entity1 manager @entity0 feels the @entity3 's decision not to charge @entity4 could have set a dangerous precedent			1
@entity6 boss @entity4 was asked to explain his comments after calling @entity1 winger @entity8 a cheat for going down under a challenge from @entity11 that earned the @entity13 a penalty in their 2 - 1 @entity16 victory earlier this month			1
tv pundit @entity17 apologised for echoing @entity19 's sentiments but the @entity21 manager stood by his comments and the @entity3 this week decided to take no further action			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes the @entity3 have set an unwelcome precedent after not charging @entity4 @entity4 called @entity8 a cheat after he went down to win a penalty in @entity1 's win against @entity6 @entity6 boss @entity4 , pictured on the touchline against @entity30 , was not punished for his comments asked if it had set an unwelcome precedent , @entity0 said : ' i think it may well have done			1
maybe that word is allowed to be used by ourselves			2
it seems to be that the @entity3 's vindicated what was said			1
' earlier in the same game , @entity6 were awarded a penalty by referee @entity41 after @entity42 tussled with @entity43 in the box			1
the issue has become a major talking point and @entity1 are angry that @entity42 has been singled out as the most high - profile offender			1
@entity0 has even relieved his captain of marking duties at set - pieces because of concerns referees are looking to punish him			2
the @entity1 manager said : ' we are speaking to people we feel have got an influence and need to be told our feelings about the situation , because we feel quite strongly			1
' sometimes you 've got to get the message across that we 're not going to stand for it and we think it 's unfair			2
i 'm sure @entity42 will be fine but , if it goes on any longer , then it 's detrimental to any player			2
we need to stop it			0
' @entity1 's @entity42 ( right ) gave away a penalty for grappling with @entity43 ( second from right ) @entity42 was at it again in the @entity72 when he held onto @entity74 's @entity73 ( centre ) @entity0 does not feel the standard of refereeing in general is where it needs to be and thinks one improvement would be for potential issues from each game to be looked at straight away			1
he said : ' my view is the whole game needs to be reviewed by the referee and his team immediately after a game rather than waiting a couple of days to see what media outcry there is and then someone who was n't even at the game is asked to see whether decisions are right or wrong			0
' he then added , in a dig at @entity96 following his ban this week : ' sometimes they 've got pop concerts to go to so maybe that 's the reason they do n't want to do that			0
' @entity1 are looking to get back to winning ways against @entity105 on saturday following back - to - back defeats by @entity74 in league and cup			2
while @entity74 are the form team of the @entity16 , @entity105 are not far behind with three successive wins , including over @entity110 last weekend			0
' they 're doing very well , playing exceptionally well , ' said @entity0			2
' they 've changed their way of playing somewhat but do n't underestimate , they still have plan a and plan b ; if they feel they need to go long , they will do			0
@entity0 was not impressed with referee @entity96 's decision to attend an @entity122 concert ' it 's not a bad option , obviously we use it as well so it 's not something to make apologies about			1
it works at the right time			0
' they 've got good pace up front			0
the lads they 've brought in have made an immediate impact , scored goals			0
it 's gone really well for them and they 're playing with a lot of confidence			0
' @entity1 will try to succeed where the @entity105 ' last seven opponents have failed in stopping @entity142 from scoring			2
the summer signing from @entity143 has been a revelation and already more than justified his reported fee of Â£ 3.5million			0
@entity1 will attempt to stop @entity105 's in - form striker @entity142 at the @entity146 on saturday @entity0 said of @entity142 : ' he has done really well			1
i did n't know a great deal about him , and they 're always a risk			0
' until you bring them to the league , you 're never quite sure how they 're going to deal with the physicality of the @entity16 , but credit to him , he 's done exceptionally well			0
he 's a real threat and i 've been very impressed with him			0
' @entity1 will be without suspended duo @entity158 and @entity159 , who @entity0 revealed has apologised following his sending off against @entity74 in midweek .			1

@entity4 called @entity1 winger @entity8 a cheat after the winger won a penalty against his side
but the @entity3 chose not to charge the @entity6 manager for his comment
@entity0 believes that the decision vindicates what @entity4 said
