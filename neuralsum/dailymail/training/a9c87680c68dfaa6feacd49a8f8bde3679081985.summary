by @entity0 a @entity2 student has written a damning open letter attacking the @entity5 ’s indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student			1
the girl , who is anonymous , posted the letter on the @entity11 's website after becoming frustrated at what she perceives as the @entity15 university 's lack of support , alleging she was discouraged from pursuing charges , which meant she had to continue living in the same dorm as her attacker			1
the student writes in the letter titled ' dear @entity2 : you win ' that the alleged incident happened in a friend 's dorm room on a friday night ' after too many drinks '			1
' i pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively			1
he said that i should ' just wear a scarf ' to cover the marks			1
he continued to abuse my body			1
' ' i was intoxicated , i was in pain , i was trapped between him and the wall , and i was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what i said			2
i stopped everything and turned my back to him , praying he would leave me alone			2
' students walk in front of the @entity2 statue on the @entity5 campus			1
the student claims she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of @entity2 's student handbook ( file photo ) she writes how he started getting impatient and made an explicit demand to which she wrote : ' it did not sound like a question			1
' the student then writes that she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of @entity2 ’s student handbook which was written in 1993			1
' when i told my @entity68 that i was considering an @entity70 process , i was told it was a bad time of the semester , that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway , and that we should n’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless			2
' shortly after , my resident dean told me that my assailant could n’t be punished because he did n’t know what he was doing			2
the resident dean compared living in the same @entity68 as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory			2
' she explains that although she was offered the chance to move to another @entity68 early on she declined because ' transferring felt utterly disempowering			0
moving to a different @entity68 would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant			0
' she also explains she wanted to be near her friends and tutors and details how she is now on anti-depressants and is now falling behind on her school work because she finds it difficult seeing her alleged attacker up to five times a day			0
' i spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed , crying , sleeping , or staring at the ceiling , occasionally wondering if i just heard my assailant ’s voice in the staircase			0
' the student says since the incident she has spent ' most of 2013 fighting the @entity2 administration so that they would move my assailant to a different @entity68 , and i have failed miserably			0
' but after her ordeal she writes : ' i will be moving out of my @entity68 next semester , if only — quite literally - to save my life			0
' according to the @entity109 , 19 percent of undergraduate women experience attempted or completed sexual assault since starting college			0
according to @entity114 per cent of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault			0
they state that ' while there are many reasons why people do not report , the most often cited reason in a 2009 investigation by the @entity120 was institutional barriers on campus			0
two examples of these institutional barriers are administrators who respond to students with disbelief or other inappropriate behavior , and campus judiciary processes that are difficult to understand and follow			0
many students who were discouraged because of these barriers transferred or withdrew from their schools , while their alleged attackers were almost uniformly unpunished			1
