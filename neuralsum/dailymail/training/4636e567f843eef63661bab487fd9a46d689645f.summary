some people are genetically predisposed to see the world negatively , and to experience emotional events more vividly than others - especially when they are negative			2
the gene , called the @entity15 deletion variant , plays a role in how the hormone and neurotransmitter norepinephrine functions			1
the variant was previously known to affect how the brain forms emotional memories			0
researchers say the new study shows that the @entity15 deletion variant also influences the way people see the world in real - time , leading some to see things negatively through ‘ gene - coloured glasses ’			1
neuroscientist professor @entity30 explained : ‘ this is the first study to find that this genetic variation can significantly affect how people see and experience the world			0
‘ we found that some individuals are predisposed to see the world more darkly than others			0
‘ a previously known genetic variation causes some individuals to perceive the world more vividly than others - and particularly negative aspects of the world			2
‘ this is important because our findings shed new light on the way that genes , along with other factors such as cultural differences or life experiences , can influence individual differences in emotional perception			0
‘ for example , people who have this variation might look out at a crowd of people and only see angry faces			0
‘ or they may be in an outdoor scene and see potential hazards - rocks where you might slip - instead of seeing the natural beauty			0
‘ so we ’ve all heard the expression “ seeing the world through rose - coloured glasses ”			2
‘ well , this is like seeing the world through gene - coloured glasses tinted a bit darkly			1
’ professor @entity73 and her team at the @entity76 ran an experiment on 200 volunteers who were tested for the @entity15 gene variant before taking a visual emotional test			0
a gene , the @entity15 deletion variant , impacts the way people see the world , leading some to see things negatively through ' gene - coloured glasses ' each was shown positive , negative and neutral words in quick succession and asked how their mood was affected			1
the team ’s results , published in @entity95 , showed people with the varied gene were more likely to perceive words as being negative than others , while both sets of people with and without the variation equally saw positive word as better than neutral words			2
professor @entity73 said : ‘ the findings suggest people experience emotional aspects of the world partly through gene - coloured glasses - and that biological variations at the genetic level can play a significant role in individual differences in perception , ’ adding that the discovery shows how genes can affect ‘ differences in emotional perception and human subjectivity ’ .			1

the gene also causes some people to see the world more vividly than others
people with the gene are more likely to perceive words as negative
