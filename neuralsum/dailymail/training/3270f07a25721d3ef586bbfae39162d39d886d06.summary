by @entity0 @entity2 - winning jockey @entity1 is set to face disciplinary action by the @entity4 for making a racist comment on the eve of the @entity7			1
@entity1 , now assistant trainer to @entity8 , can expect to be charged today for conduct prejudicial to the reputation of horseracing			2
this follows his observation that ‘ there are no n * * * * * * in here ’ while sitting on a preview panel at the @entity19 pub near @entity20 in front of 140 racing fans			0
disciplinary action : @entity1 made a racist comment on the eve of the @entity20 festival happy times : @entity1 winning the @entity2 at @entity28 on @entity29 back in 1998 the upcoming charge comes after a thorough investigation by the @entity4 , who waited until @entity33 , who questioned @entity1 under caution , had completed their inquiries			1
they are taking no action because no official complaint was made			0
racing can be an insular sport but the @entity4 were galvanised into action by @entity20 guest @entity43 , the @entity44			0
she was ‘ appalled and shocked by the use of this horrific racist word ’ , calling @entity1 ’s language ‘ absolutely indefensible ’			2
@entity1 is likely to face a @entity4 disciplinary panel the week after next saturday ’s @entity2 , with the punishment for the offence ranging from a fine to a ban from the sport			1
indefensible : minister of sport and equalities @entity43 slammed the former jockey @entity58 referee @entity57 , fortunate to be officiating on saturday after wrongly sending off @entity60 ’s @entity59 , has also escaped censure for breaching rules banning officials from talking to the media about match incidents			1
@entity57 revealed he had been ‘ knocked for six ’ after dismissing @entity59 rather than @entity66 and had ‘ analysed it to death ’			2
but the @entity69 will take no action against @entity57 because he did n’t realise a journalist was present at a talk to young players about refereeing at an event backed by the @entity75			2
sir @entity77 ’s presence at most @entity79 matches must be hard enough for his beleaguered successor @entity80 but at least sir @entity66 has stopped going to the training ground , where he liked to use @entity79 ’s state - of - the - art gym			1
and unlike other directors sir @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity77 keeps out of the dressing room after games			2
the wheels of justice move painfully slowly at @entity91 , with still no @entity93 decision on whether @entity95 boss @entity94 will face a charge six weeks after being suspended by his club			0
this follows @entity100 ’s revelation that @entity94 was under investigation for allegedly breaching betting regulations by gambling on competitions involving @entity95			0
@entity104 put shirt on @entity106 @entity108 talisman @entity107 , who has a central role in @entity104 ’s @entity111 tv commercial , is also likely to be centre stage when the @entity114 firm launch two new @entity108 shirts next week			1
@entity104 are expected to use social media for their campaign , drip - feeding information about the kit at the start of the week leading up to a grand unveiling on wednesday			1
however slick the @entity104 promotion , there will be understandable outrage that @entity108 fans are being milked for four different shirts in just over a year			0
@entity104 promise a normal production cycle after the @entity111 with the home shirt staying the same for two years			1
lucky : @entity57 , guilty of wrongly sending off @entity59 last week , has been cleared if punishment after some of his quotes reported by media boost ? relief for @entity80 , as at least sir @entity77 has stopped using @entity136 's gym facilities main man : @entity107 will be the star of @entity104 's advertising campaign for the @entity111 the @entity139 are certain to turn down @entity142 owner @entity141 ’s bid to change the name of his team to @entity142 at their summit on april 9			1
so it will make for an interesting lunch at @entity91 three days later when @entity141 , who has said he will walk away from the club if he does n’t get his way , is due to dine with the blazers before @entity142 ’s @entity151 semi-final against @entity153			0
to @entity155 , @entity79 ’s struggling midfielder , is reported to be staying with agent @entity156 , whose @entity158 agency went into administration following the breakdown in relationship between @entity156 and co-founder @entity162			0
@entity156 has reformed his agency as @entity164 and @entity165 , with @entity166 and his father , @entity167 , on board			0
no dice : the @entity93 are certain to turn down @entity141 's claim to have @entity142 's name changed			0
