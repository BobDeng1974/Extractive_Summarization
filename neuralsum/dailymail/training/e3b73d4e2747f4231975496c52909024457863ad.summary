astronomers have for the first time seen a ' fast radio burst ' – a short , sharp flash of radio waves from an unknown source – tearing through space			1
the discovery brings scientists a step closer to understanding the strange ' alien ' phenomenon , which astronomers worldwide are vying to explain			0
lasting only milliseconds , the first such radio burst was discovered in 2007 by astronomers combing the @entity15 telescope data archive for unrelated objects			1
the discovery brings scientists a step closer to understanding the strange ' alien ' phenomenon , which astronomers worldwide are vying to explain exactly what may be causing these cosmic chirps represents a major new enigma			1
possibilities range from evaporating black holes to alien communication and mergers of neutron stars			1
six more bursts , apparently from outside our galaxy , have now been found with the @entity15 telescope and a seventh with the @entity40 telescope in @entity41			1
' we 're the first to catch one in real time , ' said @entity44 , a phd candidate co-supervised at @entity45 in @entity46			0
' these bursts were generally discovered weeks or months or even more than a decade after they happened			0
' lasting only milliseconds , the first such radio burst was discovered in 2007 by astronomers combing the @entity15 telescope ( pictured ) data archive for unrelated objects banking that she 'd spot a ' live ' burst , ms @entity44 had an international team poised to make rapid follow - up observations , at wavelengths from radio to x-rays			1
after @entity15 saw the burst go off the team swung into action on twelve telescopes around the world – in @entity67 , @entity68 , the @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73 – and in space			2
first discovered in 2007 , ' fast radio bursts ' continue to defy explanation			2
these cosmic chirps last for only a thousandth of a second			2
possibilities of what causes them include a range of exotic astrophysical objects , such as evaporating black holes , mergers of neutron stars , or flares from magnetars - a type of neutron star with extremely powerful magnetic fields			1
' another possibility is that they are bursts much brighter than the giant pulses seen from some pulsars , ' notes @entity97 , a professor of astronomy at @entity99 and co-author of the new study			0
so far seven more bursts , apparently from outside our galaxy , have now been found with @entity15 telescope and a seventh with the @entity40 telescope in @entity41			1
no optical , infrared , ultraviolet or x-ray counterpart showed up			0
' that in itself rules out some possible candidates , such as long gamma - ray bursts and nearby supernovae , ' said team member dr @entity116 of the @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity68			0
but short or low - energy gamma - ray bursts and giant flares from distant magnetars - the most magnetic stars in the universe - are still contenders , she added			0
so too are imploding neutron stars			2
one of the big unknowns of fast radio bursts is their distances			2
the characteristics of the radio signal – how it is ' smeared out ' in frequency from travelling through space – indicate that the source of the new burst was up to 5.5 billion light - years away			2
' that means it could have given off as much energy in a few milliseconds as the sun does in a day , ' said team member dr @entity141 of the @entity142			0
the burst left another clue as to its identity , but a puzzling one			0
@entity15 's real - time detection system captured its polarisation – something that had not been recorded for previous bursts			1
polarisation can be thought of as the direction electromagnetic waves , such as light or radio waves , ' vibrate '			0
it can be linear or circular			0
the radio emission from the new fast radio burst was more than 20 per cent circularly polarised – which hints that there are strong magnetic fields near the source			1
identifying the origin of the fast radio bursts is now only a matter of time			1
' we 've set the trap , ' said ms @entity44			0
' now we just have to wait for another burst to fall into it			0
' the @entity169 , also known informally as ' @entity170 ' is a radio telescope observatory , located north of the town of @entity15 , @entity173 , @entity67			1

this is the first time a ' fast radio burst ' has been captured in real - time
these are cosmic chirps that last for only a thousandth of a second
no one knows where these bursts come from , but possibilities range from black holes to alien communication and mergers of neutron stars
the mystery light was captured by the @entity15 telescope in @entity67
' identifying the origin is now only a matter of time , ' scientists claim
