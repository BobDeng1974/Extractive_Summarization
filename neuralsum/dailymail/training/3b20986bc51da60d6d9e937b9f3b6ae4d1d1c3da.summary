@entity0 has labelled @entity1 a ‘ mad genius ’ as the @entity3 manager prepares for his first @entity5 game against @entity6 saturday			1
@entity0 says the @entity9 coach is prone to ‘ going off his head ’ when his team fail to follow orders during training sessions or matches			1
the former @entity3 midfielder , also criticised his former club for failing to bid for @entity18 , signed by @entity19 for £ 20million , or former @entity21 midfielder @entity20			1
he ’s a bit like a mad genius , a bit crazy			0
he ’s obviously very good at his job from where he ’s been			0
i ’ve not seen him work but i have seen clips on the telly and one moment he ’s hugging someone for doing a great pass and the next , if something ’s not right , he ’s going off his head			0
he ’s brought a bit of fear , which is no bad thing			2
' i played for 20 years for sir @entity47 and he could be a scary man			0
fear can bring performances from you			2
there ’s no doubt these players need to perform this year			2
if they do n’t , i do n’t think they ’ll be there for very long			0
‘ players will know where they stand , which is what you want			0
you knew where you stood with sir @entity47 from what you ’d done on the saturday			0
if you ’d done well , he ’d pat you on the back			0
if you had n’t , you probably would n’t be playing the next week			0
’ @entity3 finished seventh in the @entity5 last season and fired manager @entity68 in april after they lost to @entity69			1
presence : @entity0 compared @entity31 to former boss sir @entity47 and said both are ' scary ' managers now @entity0 believes @entity73 qualification will be seen as a success in @entity31 ’s first season , insisting they have no chance of winning the title			1
‘ @entity79 will be the @entity73 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s between @entity81 and @entity82 ( for the title )			1
the next two places are between @entity3 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
‘ there are a lot of players in that ( @entity3 ) team who have won leagues before			1
they are capable of getting close			0
we ’ll have to see how good the manager is , and if he can bring a couple more players in , although he might think he has enough as it is			2
@entity82 and @entity81 have got stronger squads but in the end , squads do n’t matter - it ’s what you do on the field			1
‘ in may , hopefully @entity3 will be proving people like me wrong			2
’ in the hotseat : @entity0 believes @entity73 qualification will be seen as a success during @entity31 's first season in charge @entity109 new no11 , @entity1 chasing @entity110 @entity0 was puzzled by @entity3 ’s failure to bid for world - class players such as @entity18 , @entity22 or former @entity85 midfielder @entity20			1

‘ ( @entity130 ) @entity129 is a good signing but is that the type of player they need ? ’ he said			0
