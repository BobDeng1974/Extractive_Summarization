by dr @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 pop star @entity1 posted a photo of herself last week having @entity3 injected into her bottom			1
she is the latest in a line of stars following this crazy fad , apparently as an energy boost			1
shooting up : @entity10 @entity1 , in printed trousers , left , and friend @entity11 receive @entity13 injections even for celebrities , this seems radical			1
is it really a good idea ? @entity3 injections are important for people with a deficiency and it is possible that @entity1 was prescribed this treatment			1
however , for those with normal @entity3 levels , there ’s no evidence it will help – and no proof it will replenish energy levels			2
unless you have problems with your bowel , there ’s no reason not to take a normal oral supplement			0
vitamin boost : jabs are only needed by people who have a @entity3 deficiency so why is @entity3 so important ? this vitamin is vital for a healthy nervous system and blood cells			0
it helps utilise energy from our food , which is possibly where the idea comes for fatigue - busting injections			1
@entity49 sources would be animal products including meat , eggs , cheese and milk , plus fish and fortified cereals , so most of us already get plenty from our diet			0
why do some people have it injected ? the most common cause of @entity3 deficiency is a condition called pernicious anaemia			0
this is where your stomach lacks the right protein to absorb the vitamin from food			0
it leads to immense fatigue and breathlessness , and sometimes tinnitus			0
as the condition means no @entity3 can be taken in through the gut , injections are vital and initially they are given three times a week to build up stores			1
after that , a jab once every three months is usually enough to resolve symptoms			2
what about the trend for iv vitamin drips ? these intravenous drips are completely unnecessary for otherwise healthy people			2
a balanced diet is perfectly adequate for maintaining normal levels of vitamins , and if there is any dietary lack , a tablet is enough to rectify the problem .			0

new trend of @entity97 injections growing among celebrities
pop *singer* @entity1 the latest to join as she posts picture of jab online
