row after row , this astonishing array of solar panels has completely engulfed an enormous 30 - acre field in the heart of the countryside			1
as this aerial photograph reveals , acres of beautiful @entity7 countryside have been blighted as a result , by 18,000 solar panels			1
the solar farm covers a staggering 30 acres of land creating a massive eyesore in the centre of an otherwise picturesque view			2
the solar farm , @entity17 at @entity18 in @entity7 , covers a staggering 30 acres of land creating a massive eyesore in the centre of an otherwise picturesque view photographer @entity21 , 54 , captured the image from a helicopter while flying more than 1,000ft above the solar array near @entity18			1
the energy saving farm on the @entity17 uses photo - voltaic panels to produce five megawatts of power			2
it creates enough natural energy to supply 1,000 homes each day			0
mr @entity21 boarded his friend ’s @entity32 helicopter to capture the farm which was installed last june with his @entity36 camera fitted with a 24 - 120 @entity36 zoom lens			2
photographer @entity21 captured these images from a helicopter , flying more than 1,000ft above the solar array he said : ‘ we were in the air for just over an hour and being at 1,000 feet is not really a problem			1
‘ by the time you have reached that altitude you have settled down			0
‘ the strangest sensation is just as you take off and you have an idea of how far off the ground you are			2
‘ i was able to open a window on the aircraft and take pictures through that			0
’ mr @entity21 , a professional photographer from @entity18 , feels that there is a lot of interest in alternative forms of energy			1
solar farms like this one have sprung up in recent years as farmers collect up to £ 50,000 a year in green subsidies - this site is made up of 18,000 solar pv panels , mounted on nine kilometres of frames using 5,000 ground screws ‘ many of these alternative energy sources are manufactured abroad , in @entity69 , for example			1
‘ it is very easy to say that a system is ‘ green ’ when all the energy and environmental damage and cost is made elsewhere			2
’ he added : ‘ obviously there is a lot of interest in alternative forms of energy			0
but the question remains how many of these will actually provide a real alternative to fossil fuels - so far , very few			0
‘ no one seems to have the courage to tell the truth about energy alternatives			0
’ the solar panel farm , which is the size of 18 football pitches , is one of the largest of its kind in @entity93 and took just four weeks to construct			1
it is made of 18,000 solar @entity96 panels , mounted on nine kilometres of frames using 5,000 ground screws			1
locals claim it is less of a blot on the landscape than wind farms , because the panels are completely surrounded by trees and greenery			1
energy efficiency solutions company @entity107 designed and manages the farm on the land rented from the @entity17			0
the @entity110 is also used for farming wheat , maize and livestock			0
it is best known for supplying potato to leading food manufacturers such as @entity118 crisps			0
some locals claim the solar panels are less of a blot on the landscape than wind farms , because the panels are completely surrounded by trees and greenery energy generated by the solar pv system is fed back into the national grid under the government ’s @entity128 ( @entity128 ) scheme which makes payments for energy produced through renewable sources			1
dozens of large - scale solar farms like this have sprung up in recent years as farmers put up acres of them to rake in up to £ 50,000 a year in the green subsidies			1
more than 100 new planning applications are currently in the system and work on a large - scale installation in @entity143 began last month			0
another energy firm @entity144 has set out plans to build @entity93 ’s largest solar farm , on agricultural land in @entity148 , @entity7			1
under the proposals , 225,456 panels would be laid out across an area the size of 100 football pitches			1
the scheme is intended to produce enough electricity for 31,500 people			0
however , it will soon be far more difficult to set up a solar farm on greenfield land or areas of outstanding natural beauty it was revealed last month			1
new planning guidance to be issued to local councils will state that ‘ care should be taken to preserve heritage assets , including the impact of planning proposals on views important to their setting ’			0
more than 100 new planning applications are currently in the system and work on a large - scale installation in @entity143 began last month this will not affect small scale solar installations which families can install on their roofs or farmhouses , or can be put up on industrial land			2
energy minister @entity178 has insisted that although solar has a bright future in the @entity93 it should not be in any place or at any price			0
he said last month : ‘ i want @entity93 solar targeted on industrial roofs , homes and on brownfield sites not on our beautiful countryside			0
’ campaigners near solar farms in rural beauty spots say they have become a sea of silicon slabs , which are allowed by councils to meet their renewable energy targets			2
people who set up their own solar panels benefit from the feed - in tariff			1
this has been slashed by around two - thirds over the past year after the government set the level far too high			0
however people who signed up in the early days in 2010 - 11 have their fee fixed for 25 years and continue to benefit .			0

the area in @entity7 would cover 18 football pitches and was set up in just four weeks
