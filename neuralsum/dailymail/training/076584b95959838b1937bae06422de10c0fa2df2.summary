the military judge presiding over the case of the @entity3 shooter has blocked several key pieces of evidence that prosecutors said would explain the mindset of the soldier accused in the 2009 rampage			1
on monday it was revealed that the judge has banned prosecutors from giving any speculation into @entity15 ’s motive in the shooting that left 13 dead and 30 others wounded , including the belief that he felt he had a ‘ jihad duty ’ to carry out the attack			1
prosecutors had asked the judge to approve several witnesses and various evidence to support what they allege motivated @entity15 but the judge , col. @entity25 , blocked nearly all of it			1
motive unknown : the judge has blocked several pieces of evidence that could give insight into accused killer @entity15 's mindset at the time of the 2009 shooting on @entity36 base in @entity37 @entity25 barred any reference @entity39 , a @entity40 soldier sentenced to death for attacking fellow soldiers in @entity43 during the 2003 @entity45 invasion			1
prosecutors wanted to prove @entity15 's attack was a ' copycat , ' but the judge said introducing such material would ' only open the door to a mini-trial ' of @entity39			1
snapped ? @entity15 was an @entity51 psychiatrist until 2009 , when he admits to killing 13 and injuring 30			2
he was found guilty today on all counts of against him she also said such evidence would result in a ' confusion of issues , unfair prejudice , waste of time and undo delay			0
' the judge said prosecutors also could n't introduce three emails , ruling that the needed redactions would make them irrelevant			2
the contents of the emails were never disclosed , but the @entity67 has said @entity15 sent numerous emails starting in december 2008 to @entity69 , a radical @entity71 - born @entity70 cleric killed by a drone strike in @entity73 in 2011			1
the judge also told prosecutors that they could n't cite @entity15 's interest years ago in conscientious objector status and his past academic presentations			1
@entity25 said such evidence was too old and irrelevant			0
however , the judge will allow evidence about @entity80 searches on @entity15 's computer around the time of the attack and websites that @entity15 had listed as ' favorites			2
' @entity25 said that information was more timely			0
military prosecutors opened the trial by saying they would show that @entity15 felt he had a ' jihad duty , ' referring to a @entity40 term for a religious war or struggle			1
after calling almost 80 witnesses during the last two weeks , prosecutors said friday that they would begin tackling the question this week			0
prosecutors indicated that they had between 15 and 25 witnesses left , though it was n't immediately clear how monday 's ruling would shorten prosecutors ' case			2
making his case : @entity15 , seen with a beard in court on august 8 , is serving as his own lawyer in the case but has two standby defense attorneys on hand on guard : security has been on high alert throughout the trial , which is being held on the grounds of @entity3 either way , @entity15 was expected to get his chance to defend himself as early as tuesday			0
but the @entity51 psychiatrist - who is acting as his own attorney - has put up little in a way of a defense so far and remained largely silent during the first two weeks of his trial			0
he signaled before trial that he had just two witnesses and during a barely one - minute opening statement , he told jurors that evidence ' will clearly show that i am the shooter , ' but he said it would n't tell the whole story			0
@entity15 faces numerous charges of murder and attempted premeditated murder			0
if convicted , he could face the death penalty .			0

judge blocked emails that shooter @entity15 *reportedly* sent to radical cleric @entity69
also said that prosecutors could n't mention a 2003 attack in @entity43 by a @entity40 soldier that they believe @entity15 was trying to replicate
