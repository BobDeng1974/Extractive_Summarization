@entity1 and @entity2 defender @entity0 believes the ' brutal ' nature of football fans is making it difficult for gay male players to come out			1
@entity0 , 32 , revealed in february that she is gay and is in a relationship with fellow player @entity9 , and has since had to put up with a minority castigating her over her sexuality			1
but she feels that is nothing when compared to what a male footballer would receive if he were to announce he was homosexual			2
@entity1 and @entity2 defender @entity0 says football fans make it difficult for male players to come out @entity20 is one of the biggest names in the men 's game to come out - but only after retirement former @entity25 midfielder @entity20 is one of the biggest names in the men 's game to come out - but the @entity27 international left it until after his retirement to do so			1
' people are still astonished that out of 92 @entity34 clubs , there 's not a single gay male player but then i have to say , is that not society ? ' @entity0 said in an interview with the @entity39			1
' i think because there 's so much put on it - there 's no gay male player yet , no one 's come out in the game - and there 's so much media pressure , who would want to be that person ? ' the male terraces are brutal			2
male football terraces are so far behind society , it 's unbelievable in terms of racist abuse , homophobic abuse			0
' if you 're playing in front of 60,000 people who are going to use anything to make you play badly any way , are you going to want to come out and talk about your private life			0
' it 's going to be a massive step for whoever does it			0
it will be a really positive step			0
