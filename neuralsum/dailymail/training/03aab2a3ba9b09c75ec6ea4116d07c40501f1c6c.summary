she said : ' i used to park up and take @entity8 inside , because i am sometimes able to walk with a walking stick , depending on my health , but this particular restaurant is not accessible for my mobility scooter			1
' i have also used the drive - through with @entity8 on several occasions without any member of staff saying a word			2
