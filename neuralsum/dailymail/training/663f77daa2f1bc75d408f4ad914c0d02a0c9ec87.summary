by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity2 's own goal gave @entity4 side @entity5 a deserved win at @entity7 as @entity9 's final preparations before the new @entity11 season ended with an uninspiring defeat			1
substitute @entity2 turned home a dangerous cross with just over 20 minutes remaining , while new signing @entity15 made his debut for @entity9 's side , playing the full 90 minutes			1
@entity19 and @entity20 promised much for the new season in a five - man defensive line , but question marks still remain over the future of striker @entity25 , who was not named on the bench for saturday 's game despite taking part in a full training session beforehand			1
ready for the new season : @entity30 was bright for the home side during their 1 - 0 defeat strong in the challenge : @entity34 holds off @entity5 's @entity35 at @entity7 on saturday afternoon @entity36 ( 5 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity20 , @entity19 ( @entity2 58 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 58 ) , @entity30 ; @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 67 ) , @entity15 ; @entity44 ( @entity45 58 ) , @entity34 subs not used : @entity47 , @entity30 , @entity48 , @entity49 @entity5 : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 goal : @entity2 o.g 67 @entity9 ended pre-season with three wins out of seven going into saturday 's opener at home to @entity78			1
his side were disjointed in the opening 45 minutes , failing to register a shot on target despite fielding a strong side for the @entity85 runners up			0
@entity41 struck a speculative effort over the bar in the opening minutes after goalkeeper @entity50 scuffed his kick , before @entity15 's cross-cum - shot flew just wide after muscling his way into the area			2
@entity15 , making his debut , did just enough to impress a sparse @entity7 crowd on his debut , the 6ft 2in new signing providing height and strength in midfield and a threat in the penalty area			1
with seven @entity11 goals last term , the Â£ 6million capture from @entity102 should be money well spent			0
but the home side did anything but impress			0
a long ball pumped upfield by @entity5 was headed clear by @entity19 but only as far as @entity55 , who hit wide on the volley			2
fun in the sun : @entity36 boss @entity9 watches on as his team end their pre-season with defeat to @entity5 the visitors should have been one up after 12 minutes , @entity115 seeing his effort blocked by @entity20 after @entity117 had misjudged a cross			1
@entity36 have a goalscorer in @entity34 , in the championship at least			1
time will tell whether he can reproduce that form in the @entity11 , but @entity36 do have a proven hit man in @entity25			1
the @entity125 , who travelled with @entity127 's side to @entity128 a week ago for their pre-season tour , trained on the pitch before saturday 's game despite not being considered fully match fit			0
his failed move to @entity134 created another unwanted transfer saga , but @entity36 will want to concentrate on integrating him back into the fold to partner last season 's top scorer @entity140			2
@entity36 's @entity141 was shy in front of goal despite hitting four in pre-season , opting to make one pass too many before a dire first - half came to a close			1
just after the break , @entity148 ' first - time effort forced a superb save out of @entity37 having been found in yards of space inside the penalty area			0
@entity37 then produced another fine stop down low to his right from @entity55 's effort , before @entity148 ' rebounded effort hit the post with the goal gaping from three yards			0
@entity5 continued to dominate the game as substitute @entity40 made a last - ditch tackle to deny @entity56 in the six - yard box			2
and the @entity4 deservedly led after 67 minutes			0
substitute @entity66 drove into the box , slid the ball into the danger area for @entity2 to knock into his own goal			2
it took until the 71st minute for @entity36 to test the opposite goalkeeper ; substitute @entity43 's long - range effort tipped over by @entity62			0
from the resulting corner , @entity140 's header was cleared off the line as @entity36 sprung to life			0
however , despite the tight scoreline , @entity36 were well beaten .			0

*recent* signing @entity15 made his first start following move to @entity36
he and @entity34 played well for hosts in the first half but later faded
@entity25 *warmed* up with the squad before the match *buy* played no part
a @entity2 own goal midway through the second half handed @entity5 *victory*
