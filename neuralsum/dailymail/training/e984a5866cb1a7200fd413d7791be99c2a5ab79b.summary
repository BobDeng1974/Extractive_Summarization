by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter beleaguered cable network @entity3 faces a new challenge as competitors try to loosen their grip on the airport television market			1
a new television display created by rival @entity9 will threaten @entity3 â€™s dominance , as they have had unmatched usage of the television sets hanging in front of passengers at departure gates for much of the past two decades			1
the two companies will be competing for the attention of travel - weary passengers , and advertising company @entity9 has signed deals with major tv networks like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 to provide competitive content on their new hanging displays			2
@entity26 : for the past 21 years , @entity3 has ruled the airport television airwaves and now an advertising company is going to placing entertainment - filled displays in the same waiting lounges causing competition the service provided by @entity9 , the second - largest outdoor advertising company behind @entity33 , will use their deals with the entertainment networks to fuel their ' @entity37 ' service			1
@entity38 , @entity9 's head of airports , said the company is in discussions with about 20 airports including some large ones where @entity3 has its tvs , though the first airport @entity37 will enter in november is @entity47 in @entity48 , where @entity3 does not have a presence			1
' the airports want something that 's different and they want something where they can have a variety of content that they can provide the passengers , ' mr @entity38 said			0
mr @entity38 said @entity9 previously had agreements to sell advertising with @entity3 in a handful of airports in the @entity62 , and that advertisers did not see the value in @entity3 's offering			1
in response , a @entity3 spokeswoman said that its airport network has been ' a valued brand for over 21 years ' and a ' reliable source of current news programming and localized custom content for busy , on - the - go travelers			2
' @entity3 's screens can be seen in 49 of the busiest @entity62 airports , including @entity76 and @entity78 / @entity77			1
@entity3 said it reaches 248 million customers every year in airports			2
keeping travelers in touch : @entity3 wo n't lose their presence , but they will be threatened by further competition this is just the latest in a string of blows for @entity3 , as their ratings this year have steadily lagged behind theirs of years past			1
while airport advertising is not as big a business as cable tv , it makes more than $ 10million a year for @entity3 , according to a source familiar with the situation			1
any setback will hurt the reach of @entity3 , which has lagged in the ratings behind @entity101 's @entity100 and @entity103 's @entity102			2
@entity3 is searching for a new president after its longtime chief @entity105 said he would depart by the end of the year			2
@entity109 ceo @entity108 singled out @entity3 last quarter for being a weak spot			0
mr @entity38 said @entity9 will initially roll out in mid-sized airports			0
to try to win over customers , @entity37 will offer a wider array of programming and air shows ranging from comedies to @entity118 's morning business updates			0
@entity3 mainly focuses on pulling news and programming from its networks @entity3 , @entity121 , @entity122 and some local segments			0
both companies said they are able to show live sports			0
@entity9 also aims to stand out by letting travelers connect their mobile devices wirelessly to the tv sets starting in the first quarter of next year , so travelers can watch the airport programs on their own screens while they are waiting			0
eventually , travelers will be able to select from different channels			0
' so , one traveler can watch news while a person sitting next to them can watch @entity139 , ' mr @entity38 said .			0
