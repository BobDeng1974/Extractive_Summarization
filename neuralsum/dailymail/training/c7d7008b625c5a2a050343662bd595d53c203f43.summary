a young @entity1 designer is locked in a legal battle with @entity3 after the store began selling framed wall prints that she says are almost identical to her work			1
@entity7 , 31 , has been creating framed pictures of large printed messages on top of old pages from a dictionary since 2009 , selling them through her independent art business @entity14			1
but the artist became alarmed when she learned that @entity3 had begun selling almost identical prints - using a similar font and with the slogans in the same position as her work - through its stores and website			1
similar : @entity7 's work ( left ) and ( right ) the @entity3 version she said : ‘ at first , people were really pleased for me because they thought i ’d been commissioned by @entity3 , but obviously i had n’t			1
’ taking inspiration from her love of words and books mrs @entity7 says she collects quotes form classic literature , films , songs and ‘ other wise old sources to print onto vintage book pages ’			1
describing her products as ‘ literary gifts ’ , she said : ‘ you ’ll also find some vintage map prints , book page jewellery and greetings cards in the mix. ’ the designer added : ‘ it all started with an antique @entity46 dictionary and my grandfather ’s set of water colours			2
‘ i still spend a lot of time hunting through old bookshops looking for inspiration and for books to give a new lease of life as a little piece of art. ’ the prints are then mounted in frames supplied by her parent ’s company , making the product very much family - inspired			2
concerned that the @entity67 retailer had stolen her idea the designer , a married mother - of - one from @entity70 , @entity71 , instructed solicitors who advised her @entity3 had breached her copyright			1
success : mrs @entity7 sold over 2,000 wall prints in the eight weeks leading up to christmas 2013 , priced at £ 24.75 each last night mrs @entity7 told the @entity76 : ‘ i just wish @entity3 had have commissioned me to do the work - that would have been amazing			1
‘ there are loads of brilliant small designers who could be doing that for them			0
’ a legal letter sent to @entity3 said : ‘ the image posted on your @entity86 site shows a substantially similar product			2
it is our contention that this is a substantially similar product			0
it is our contention that this is a substantial taking of our client ’s work and hence an infringement of her copyright			0
‘ we therefore request that you immediately remove this image from your @entity86 site , and any other location in which it may be available			0
we further request that you supply us with information regarding the producer of this infringing product			0
’ however the retail giant dismissed her concerns claiming her designs used a ‘ common technique ’			2
and in a fiercely worded legal letter , drafted by @entity3 solicitor @entity109 , branded her claim of breach of copyright as ‘ unfounded ’			2
response : the retail giant dismissed mrs @entity7 's concerns claiming her designs used a ' common technique ' it said : ‘ whilst there may or may not be copyright subsisting in any particular work your client has produced , we do not believe that your client can claim a monopoly in the actual use of ‘ over-laying ’ printed words on dictionary pages			1
‘ it is our understanding that overlaying of typed words or other imagery on a background of a densely worded page from a dictionary , is not an uncommon design feature			0
‘ accordingly , your client ’s allegations of copyright infringement are unmeritorious and unfounded			0
’ mrs @entity7 said she was not surprised by @entity3 ’s response and acknowledged it would be a @entity143 versus @entity145 fight if the case ever went to court			1
she said : ‘ they must know it will cost me tens of thousands of pounds in legal fees to take this further with no guarantee that i ’ll get the money back if i win			0
‘ my concern is that my business will suffer , including my mother , father and brother ’s business , which i buy the frames from			0
’ mrs @entity7 sold over 2,000 wall prints in the eight weeks leading up to christmas 2013 , priced at £ 24.75 each			1
@entity3 began selling their own wall prints in november last year , priced at £ 25.00 each			1
last night @entity3 said it was no longer selling the framed wall prints , claiming the product had only been released as a ‘ small buy ’			1
the firm added it was trying to reach agreement with mrs @entity7			2
a spokeswoman said : ‘ we take all claims of intellectual property infringement extremely seriously			0
‘ we ’ve investigated this thoroughly and determined that the technique of overlaying text on print is a common design practice			0
‘ we ’ve already been in touch with @entity14 directly and we ’re happy to follow up with them if they have any questions .			0
