there has been no bigger beneficiary from @entity3 ’s demise as @entity5 one - day captain than @entity6 who has stepped up from the @entity8 sidelines to become a thoroughly modern @entity10 opener in a couple of easy strides			1
@entity6 ’s participation in the biggest tournament in one - day cricket was in doubt when he was left out after two matches of @entity5 ’s tour of @entity19 but the late switch away from @entity3 gave him a lifeline he has gratefully seized			1
now after following up his 187 in a warm - up match in @entity23 with a dreamy unbeaten 88 against @entity24 he can reflect on a dramatic switch in one - day fortunes that sees him with one final chance of making a @entity10 impact			1
@entity6 enjoys an @entity5 training session ahead of friday 's clash with @entity31 ‘ i still thought i would get on the trip , ’ insisted @entity6 as he reflected on his pre-christmas plight ahead of friday ’s @entity34 game against @entity31			1
‘ i ’m someone with experience who can play in a variety of roles			0
but i probably did n’t expect to be in this position			0
‘ when i spoke to @entity44 out here and he said he wanted me to open it was a massive confidence boost			0
looking back , my most successful time in one - day cricket came in the two years i opened so i wanted to get back to that			2
’ his elevation , which was proposed by the @entity5 coaches and then endorsed by new captain @entity44 , was interpreted by many as a reflection of the ‘ old - fashioned ’ tactics that had held @entity5 back in the limited - overs game			1
yet the coaches still had reservations about @entity56 ' technique and wanted to continue with their original game - plan of having a ‘ proper ’ batsman at the top of the order to try to bat through the 50 overs			2
@entity3 ran out of chances to show he was in good enough form to fulfil the brief so @entity6 has been able to step up			1
@entity5 ’s classiest @entity67 batsman is clear on his role			1
‘ @entity69 has come out and had a really good go at the bowlers and i want to be similar to that , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ maybe it will be in a slightly different style , a bit more orthodox , but the important thing is recognising the surface you ’re on and putting your foot down if it ’s flat or getting through it if it ’s doing a bit			0
’ @entity6 leaves the field after @entity5 's impressive victory over @entity24 in which he hit an unbeaten 88 if @entity5 are going to make an impact in the @entity10 then they will have to post scores of 300 plus with at least one batsman making the big century or even double hundred that are becoming common place in one - day cricket			1
@entity6 is convinced he can deliver the goods			1
‘ opening the batting in those first 10 overs suits my game , certainly in these conditions when there ’s more bounce and you can play off the back foot or hit it over the field			2
‘ i ’ve tried to work hard even in @entity19 when i was n’t playing			0
when you play for @entity5 you always try to get better and not stand still			2
this game is changing all the time and you have to go with that or you get left behind			0
‘ i would n’t say i ’ve changed anything dramatically			0
i would n’t say that anything i did the other night or in @entity23 was any different			2
it ’s just we ’ve given a lot of thought over the last few months as to what we want to do here and it ’s about executing that now			0
there are certain areas we ’ve identified			0
’ @entity6 plays a shot past @entity24 's bowler @entity118 during their one - day clash it would be a huge boost for @entity5 if they could execute those plans against @entity31 at the @entity124 and they will never have a better chance to end their dismal run of results here as the hosts are missing key players			1
@entity130 became the latest @entity131 to pull out through injury and he joins @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 on the sidelines			0
@entity6 was out first ball to the pace of @entity139 when @entity31 won in @entity140 at the start of this warm - up tri-series and knows he has to succeed against them if he is to truly establish himself among the leading openers here			1
‘ i did n’t spend enough time at the crease to lose form , ’ said @entity6 of his golden duck			2
‘ it was disappointing but those opening 10 overs from @entity31 were world - class			0
we have to start well now			0
it would be good to do it against @entity31 and kick on from there			0

@entity6 has seized his chance after @entity3 was axed as captain
@entity6 hit 187 in a warm - up match in @entity23 and 88 against @entity24
he will now have one final shot at @entity10 *glory* with @entity5
