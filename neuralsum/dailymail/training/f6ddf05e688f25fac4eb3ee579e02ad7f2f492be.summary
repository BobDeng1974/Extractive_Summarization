trapped : the man cowers in the corner of the room as the creature encroaches on him the horrifying @entity7 's head is made of a mixture of papier - mache , wire , and plenty of feathers he says , ' the @entity67 prank was carefully set up over a period of several weeks , where we assessed how often visitors went to the hospital and what times they were most likely to appear			2
' once we were confident that our unfortunate victims were most likely to appear during a certain day and time , we lay in wait			0
' we pranked about six people during the day , and the first three reactions were the most dramatic to share			2
' reactions were consistent with @entity78 , people either slamming doors shut , barricading and screaming at the @entity44 to leave or escaping out of the hospital at top speed			2
' the first reaction is the epitome of all things @entity86 and that ’s what makes him marvellous			1
' the fact that we have an angry bald man shouting furiously is fantastic			0
