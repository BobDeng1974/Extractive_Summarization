the prosecutors contended he was a danger to society , something backed up by reports of previous domestic violence incidents and claims to @entity42 from a person close to the situation that he previously made violent threats against the family of an ex-girlfriend			0
the person , who declined to be named for fear of reprisals in the community , confirmed reports mr @entity11 was violent in previous relationships and also spoke of him violating a restraining order			1

they include assault with a dangerous weapon ( a belt ) , two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon			2
the assault with a belt charges likely stem from earlier reported abuse the child suffered at the hands of both her and mr @entity11 , but officials are remaining tight - lipped about the case			1
@entity15 is feared dead , and mr @entity11 has been hit with multiple felony charges that come just short of murder			1

' ' he was a wonderful little boy , as happy as could be , ' said mr @entity163			2
' it 's just awful thinking of him lying somewhere			0
' ' the first question that should have been asked is where is that little boy , ' the family friend added			0
