@entity0 is poised to make just one change to his starting line - up for @entity3 on saturday , fit - again @entity4 returning in place of @entity6			1
injured on february 14 against @entity7 , @entity4 has timed his recovery from the three vertebrae fractured by @entity10 perfectly			0
it was anticipated that the problem , treated like a soft tissue injury , could come right in four weeks and the medics have been proved spot on , @entity4 taking part in full training all week to put himself in the frame to resume against @entity3			2
@entity20 head coach @entity0 is likely to make one change to the side that beat @entity23 @entity4 ( centre ) is expected to be back after injuring himself against @entity7 on february 14 @entity25 ( left ) has recovered from the hamstring problem that he had for @entity20 @entity6 will consider himself unlucky not to have held on , given his impressive show in helping subdue the vaunted @entity28 back row , but @entity4 has been true to his word after saying last friday that he was ‘ pretty confident ’ he would be declared fit for the @entity31			1
@entity6 is now expected to take a place on the bench at the expense of @entity35 who demonstrated his worth for the second time this spring , coming on as an early replacement against @entity23 for the concussed @entity40 and again not looking out of his depth			2
