everybody likes to believe that they will leave some kind of mark on this earth when they die , but for some , nobody will ever even know they are gone in the @entity9 , there are more than 2,000 unidentified women lying in morgues and unmarked graves across the country			1
artist @entity14 , 19 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has now painted the portraits of several of these females alongside the limited details of their deaths , and any other information that is known about them in a project called @entity25			1

she said : ' i think that everyone deserves some form of legacy and in a way when these women died and went unidentified it was as if their slates had been wiped clean			1
' no name , no memories , no legacy			2
' i thought that once i was aware of this information it would be wrong of me to ignore it			0
