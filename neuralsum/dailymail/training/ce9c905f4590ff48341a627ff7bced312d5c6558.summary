@entity0 today tore into the @entity1 for walking out on talks on @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws , accusing @entity6 of ' not being interested in fairness ' for the whole of the @entity9			1
@entity1 announced it would boycott talks on addressing the @entity4 problem , branding government plans ' a closed shop stitch - up '			1
it came as a @entity16 debate got underway on devolving more powers to @entity18 in the wake of the independence referendum			1
hours after the result showed 55 per cent of people rejected independence , mr @entity0 announced that he wanted to also tackle the problem of stopping @entity18 mps voting on laws which only apply to @entity4			1
today mr @entity0 rejected the suggestion that he was playing politics with the @entity39 following the vow made to the people of @entity18 during the referendum campaign			1
he said : ' what we need is obviously more devolution for @entity18 but a settlement that 's fair for the whole of the @entity9			2
' i think it 's a matter of great regret if @entity1 are going to walk out of this cabinet committee which they could join in and make their suggestions			2
' but obviously they are not interested in fairness across the @entity9 so we will have to work hard with other partners to make sure we deliver			0
' commons leader @entity57 today told @entity35 that devolution of increased powers to @entity18 will go ahead as promised , regardless of talks on @entity4 votes former pm @entity62 warned against @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws people living in @entity18 must be recognised as a minority , @entity62 said today as he railed against plans for @entity4 vote for @entity4 laws			1
the former prime minister warned that implementing proposals to devolve income tax to the @entity71 in full and then depriving @entity18 mps of voting on the @entity74 would be ' absolutely lethal to the constitution '			2
the @entity1 mp for @entity77 and @entity78 said : ' you can not have one @entity9 if you have two separate classes of @entity35			2
' mr @entity62 said the ' fundamental question ' affecting the @entity9 constitution was not the @entity84 question , which he argued was a symptom of a more fundamental problem about the fair distribution of power			2
speaking during a commons general debate on devolution following the @entity18 referendum , he said : ' the fundamental question in the @entity9 constitution is that when you have @entity4 84 per cent of the @entity39 , @entity18 8 per cent of the @entity39 , @entity94 5 per cent of the @entity39 , @entity95 3 % of the @entity39 ... ' you have the reality that at any point the votes of @entity4 could outvote @entity18 , @entity94 and @entity95 individually or collectively			1
' the real fundamental issue , the real issue is a fair distribution of power , that respects not only majority rule - and i am sensitive to the needs of @entity4 and to @entity4 voters - but also respects the rights of the minorities so that we have stability and we have harmony in the @entity9 constitution			2
' he said every generation had had to come to terms with ' how you get that balance right between the majority rule and the needs of the minorities that are part of the @entity9 '			0
@entity122 has made clear the talks will go ahead without @entity1 , and said it would be for @entity6 's party to explain its absence if it chose not to take part			1
commons leader @entity57 has been appointed chairman of a cabinet committee tasked with drawing up proposals , and he has invited other parties to take part in talks			0
but a @entity1 source has confirmed the party will not take part , saying : ' we need proper reform , not a closed - shop stitch - up in a @entity128 room			1
' in the @entity16 today , mr @entity57 warned insensitivity and indifference to the @entity4 votes problem is the greatest threat to the @entity39			1
he insisted that the vow of further powers for @entity71 would happen in all circumstances			0
but he said increased devolution to @entity18 following last month 's no vote created an imperative to improve representation and decision making for all parts of the @entity39			0
mr @entity57 told @entity35 : ' i know there are mps who argue that to address this question is to somehow put the @entity9 itself at risk , but i say to them the @entity9 is in greater danger if the legitimate arguments and expectations of @entity4 decision making , on decisions effecting only @entity4 , are not responded to			0
' insensitivity and indifference is the danger to the union in all nations including in @entity4			0
' speaking during a noisy commons session , mr @entity57 insisted the @entity128 committee he chairs at the request of the prime minister was the best way of resolving the immediate questions over @entity4 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
and he suggested the government could be open to a constitutional convention to discuss the wider issues raised by greater devolution to the different nations of the @entity39 , but not on the basis it would delay the immediate discussions and decisions			0
mr @entity57 criticised @entity1 for abandoning the committee , adding : ' it has been proposed there should be a constitutional convention to discuss these issues in the future and the @entity1 can come to the cabinet committee and put that forward - but they seem unwilling to do so			2
' indeed , the government will consider the proposals for the establishment of such a body on the right terms and at the right time			0
' however , @entity18 first minister @entity190 has accused mr @entity0 of already ' reneging ' on pledges made during the referendum campaign			1
' the prime minister started the process of reneging on the commitment when he came out of @entity122 hours after the referendum and said that progress in @entity18 should be in tandem with ... constitutional change in @entity4			1
even @entity62 is finding it difficult to stomach , ' he told @entity203 's today programme			0
the first minister also indicated that he did not view another referendum as completely off the agenda			0
' what i said was that the referendum was a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , ' he said			0
' my view is that constitutional referendums came along once every political generation - about every 20 years or so			0
' circumstances obviously can change			0
clearly , if you had a situation where three leaders made such a public vow - not even a political promise but a vow - in the last few desperate hours when they thought they were losing the referendum campaign and then reneged upon it , then that would obviously be a very , very substantial change of circumstances			1
' these matters ultimately are for the people of @entity18 to decide			2
it is for the people of @entity18 to decide whether it is satisfactory to be conned and tricked by @entity232 leaders , or they will exact a revenge at the ballot box			1

@entity0 *condemns* @entity1 for walking out on negotiations
three party leaders issued ' vow ' to devolve more powers to @entity18
pledge was made in the run - up to the independence referendum
but after @entity18 voted no , the @entity246 called for @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws
ex-pm @entity62 warns people in @entity18 are in a minority
