scientists have undermined a central plank of the anti-fracking lobby ’s case by showing that the controversial drilling process does not poison drinking water			1
vociferous protesters against hydraulic fracturing in @entity8 base much of their opposition on claims that the process poses an environmental danger			0
fracking involves injecting water , sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale rock deep underground , releasing rich deposits of oil and natural gas trapped inside			2
it has transformed the @entity25 energy industry			2
scientists claim that there is no evidence that fracking has caused contamination of water sources but green campaigners in @entity8 have brandished reports from @entity25 saying that methane from the drilling has frequently contaminated groundwater supplies			1
now , however , a study by researchers at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 , shows that the contamination in these highly publicised cases was not due to the fracking but to leaky drilling wells			1
the distinction is crucial , say industry experts , because it means that the environmental risks of fracking can be pretty much eliminated by ensuring the well is properly sealed with concrete and that there are no leaks in the steel pipes used to take the gas to the surface			1
a separate report by the @entity25 government , published yesterday , provided further gloom for anti-fracking campaigners in the @entity8			1
the study at a @entity63 gas well found that the chemical - laced fluids used to free gas stayed about 5,000ft below drinking water supplies			0
in the @entity39 study , researchers analysed 131 drinking water wells in @entity63 and @entity70 that had been contaminated by methane and other toxic gases			1
however , there is strong opposition to the introduction of fracking in @entity8 despite scientific safety studies they found no evidence that fracturing shale led to the water contamination and said their findings are also likely to apply to thousands more wells across the country			2
dr @entity85 , one of the study ’s authors , said : ‘ in all cases , it basically showed well integrity was the problem			0
the good news is , improvements in well integrity can probably eliminate most of the environmental problems with gas leaks			0
’ professor @entity97 , who also worked on the study , said they could ‘ say categorically ’ that they had not seen gas escaping from the drilled shale rock and getting into aquifers [ rock containing water ]			0
natural gas on its own is not poisonous but in high concentrations it can lead to explosions and fires .			0

@entity25 researchers claim that fracking does not contaminate water sources
green campaigners claim the process is dangerous and should be *banned*
researchers from @entity39 say a properly sealed well is safe
experts claim that concrete could *prevent* any leakage and contamination
