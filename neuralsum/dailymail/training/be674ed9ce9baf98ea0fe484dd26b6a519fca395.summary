by @entity0 the morning queue for cronuts may be a lot shorter after a mouse was recorded scampering around @entity5 on thursday			1
the downtown @entity7 bakery became famous last year when owner and pastry chef @entity5 invented the cronut - a croissant / doughnut hybrid that has inspired epic hour - long waits in the morning			1
but on thursday a @entity12 user took video of a mouse scampering around what appears to be the bakery 's floor , which could cause the health department to close the facility			1
' i pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me			0
they did n't believe it until i showed them the video			2
then they had to leave , ' @entity44 said			0
' i did n't mention it to employees			0
it appeared they were all aware of it			0
' this was the tail end of the little guy 's adventure			0
he ran all over the place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before i got my phone out			0
maybe @entity5 needs a cat ? like bakeries did in the old days , ' he suggested			2
an employee who answered the phone at @entity5 thursday evening referred all comments to their pr representative , who later emailed a statement saying the famed bakery has done a deep clean			1
' following up on hearing the news , our staff spent 7 hours in a deep clean session , ' the rep told @entity82			1
' we did not find anything at all and suspect it may been one solitary mouse that came in from the outside as we have a garden in the back and open the doors during the warmer days			2
' cleanliness is of utmost importance to us and in the 3 years that we 've been opened , we 've received nothing short of an a for our health inspections			0
' the video comes just two days after another @entity12 user posted two videos of rats infesting a @entity98 location			1
after hearing about the reports , the @entity99 investigated and shut down the store at @entity102 and @entity103 , citing a ' severe ' pest infestation			1
while the location manager initially denied the store had a vermin problem when contacted by @entity46 on wednesday , today a man who answered the phone said : ' we have some issues '			0
the location captured in the video previously had an ' a ' rating from the health department , despite getting a citation for vermin - related issues in november 2013			2
