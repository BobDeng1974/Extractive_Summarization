it was @entity1 here — the same old , familiar plot			2
a narrow loss for @entity5			1
talk of positives and lessons to learn			2
simmering rage , barely suppressed			2
@entity13 was wrestling with the same emotions he had felt five months earlier in @entity15 , when the @entity17 ’ margin of victory had been a solitary point			1
he spoke then of ‘ failure ’ and the @entity22 full - back was n’t about to sugar - coat his assessments this time			1
‘ if we ’re brutally honest , it is another “ what if ? ” , ’ he said , as the grimace on his face conveyed so much personal angst			0
‘ we ’re here to win and again we ’ve let it go			0
we ’ve got to start putting these games away and there is massive disappointment at the moment			0
’ videos scroll down to watch @entity5 lost 24 - 21 against @entity17 at @entity37 after an impressive second half from the @entity17 @entity5 's dominance in the first quarter could not be turned into points and the visitors took charge @entity5 players look dejected during the demoralising defeat against @entity17 on saturday afternoon @entity5 look frustrated during their loss against @entity17 at a rain - soaked @entity37 @entity5 went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive @entity17 team @entity17 celebrate as they beat @entity5 on saturday afternoon 24 - 21 with an impressive second half @entity5 : @entity13 6 ; @entity51 7 , @entity52 8 , @entity53 7 , @entity54 may 8 ; @entity55 6 , @entity56 7 ; @entity57 7 , @entity58 7 ( capt ) , @entity60 6 ; @entity61 6 , @entity62 8 ; @entity63 7 , @entity64 7 , @entity65 7 replacements : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 @entity17 : @entity75 6 ; @entity76 7 , @entity77 6 , @entity78 7 , @entity79 7 ; @entity80 8 , @entity81 7 ; @entity82 7 , @entity83 9 ( capt ) , @entity84 7 ; @entity85 , @entity86 6 ; @entity87 6 , @entity88 7 , @entity89 7 replacements : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 referee : @entity100 ( @entity101 ) putting a finger on the reasons why proved difficult			1
@entity13 talked about some ‘ momentum - shifts ’ which went against @entity5			1
he conceded that ‘ maybe ’ his fumble from @entity53 ’s pass which should have created a second try was a significant factor , although he pointed to his efforts to stem the black tide at the other end			0
whatever the causes , his over- riding message was sheer dejection at the outcome			0
‘ one reason @entity117 ( @entity118 ) picks the players he does is we are all competitive , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ i probably show it more than some of the other guys who keep it to themselves , but we ’re all competitive and we want to win , so we are annoyed and disappointed			0
’ in reference to the next instalment of the @entity128 series , against the wounded @entity129 this saturday , @entity13 added : ‘ we have to get over this quickly because we ’ve got another massive test next week			0
but at the moment i ’m going to sulk because we came up short			0
’ in reality , despite the distorting effect of a late @entity5 penalty try , the harsh truth is that the national team came up some distance short this time			1
after an electrifying start featuring a sensational try by @entity141 , the hosts ’ challenge subsided alarmingly as the stadium was engulfed in an autumn downpour			1
the @entity17 perform their haka before the match between @entity5 and @entity17 on saturday @entity17 beat @entity5 after a courageous effort from the home side at @entity37 on saturday afternoon @entity141 scores a sensational solo try for @entity5 after three minutes as the fans at @entity37 celebrate may celebrates after his superb try against the @entity17 that saw @entity5 take an early lead may and @entity56 celebrate the opening try of the match between @entity5 and @entity17 the @entity5 team gather together to celebrate the opening try against the @entity17 @entity17 were commanding			1
they squeezed and suffocated their rivals — playing the conditions expertly , while @entity5 floundered in their own half ; undermined by a lack of composure and kicking deficiencies			1
@entity118 ’s men could not escape the world champions ’ grip , even when they had a numerical advantage while @entity88 was in the sin bin			0
the @entity172 party line afterwards was that this contest swung on a third quarter dominated by the @entity175 but , in truth , @entity178 ’s team had recovered from a sluggish start and found some rhythm before the break			2
the home side were still under the cosh after the hour mark , as they conceded one penalty that @entity97 squandered and another he sent through the posts			0
then came another illustration of the gulf between these teams			2
the @entity17 ’ 72nd - minute try , scored by @entity93 , was an exhibition of wet - weather rugby as they drove and passed at close quarters until they were over the line			1
that summed up the clinical edge that @entity17 possess			1
earlier , shortly after may justified his selection by scorching past @entity77 and @entity75 to score , he leapt to gather a bouncing kick in the opposition 22 , but was unable to release @entity55			2
@entity80 dives on the line to score the try that brought the two teams level early in the first half @entity80 takes his kick during the @entity207 match at @entity37 on a soggy saturday in @entity208 @entity55 takes a penalty during their clash with @entity17 at @entity37 on saturday afternoon while it is harsh to highlight such a missed opportunity , in the same situation the @entity17 would take the chance			1
it was the same scenario moments later , when @entity13 dropped @entity53 ’s pass			0
@entity5 will not win these contests until they develop that killer instinct			1
@entity62 , the @entity221 lock who was magnificent on his return to the starting xv , conceded said : ‘ we talk about being clean and clinical in our half and in the second half there were too many instances when we did n’t execute well enough			2
' if we ’re going to become world champions , we need to execute an awful lot better			0
’ talk of ‘ positives ’ after defeat conveys a jarring message that the result is not the be-all and end - all			1
a spell of pressure for @entity17 saw @entity83 gather the ball and drive over the line at @entity37 @entity83 dives over the line to score a try despite the best efforts of @entity5 's @entity64 yet may ’s finish was dazzling , @entity53 impressed , @entity52 was strong and @entity58 put in a herculean shift			1
the lineout was immaculate while the scrum reserves earned the penalty try which made the scoreline falsely respectable			0
post-match speculation about a @entity254 final between these nations next year seemed fanciful			0
the development stage stretches on , as does the losing run , which now stands at four @entity258 — albeit all against the @entity175			0
next up are @entity129 , stung by defeat in @entity261			2
a tough week could turn into a tough month			0
@entity83 gives @entity17 a 16 - 14 lead against @entity5 as the @entity17 went on to win the match prince @entity264 pictured watching the match between @entity5 and @entity17 at a rain - soaked @entity37			1

@entity80 brought it level to 5 - 5 but both teams missed *conversions*
@entity5 went in at half time 14 - 11 but the visitors kept within touching distance
pressure for @entity17 after break saw captain @entity83 score
@entity5 ultimately *slumped* to their fifth *successive* defeat in a 24 - 21 loss
