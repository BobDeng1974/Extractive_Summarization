by @entity0 for @entity1 historians have spent years debating whether @entity3 was once a complete circle			1
despite numerous tests and excavations , the mystery remained unsolved for almost 5,000 years			2
but staff at the neolithic site believe the question has finally been answered - all because a hosepipe was too short			0
a short hosepipe meant they could not reach the area where there is a gap in the outer circle			1
the ground then became parched and revealed where stones that have been missing for years once are believed to have once stood the hosepipe , which would have been stretched to the prehistoric ring of stones from the top right hand corner , could not reach the bottom left of the circle where there is a gap in the stones			1
it meant the grass was dry and revealed what are thought to be ' stone holes ' every summer stewards at the ancient monument in @entity47 water the site to keep the grass healthy and green and the earth well nourished			1
but this year the hosepipe was not log enough and failed to reach the outer part of the circle - where no stones stand			1
the dried out land , which could n't be reached , revealed marks of parched grass which were spotted by a volunteer who alerted experts			2
@entity13 believe the discovery has finally revealed the location of missing sarsen stones which once completed the @entity3 circle			0
@entity65 , from @entity13 , said : ' it 's really significant , and it shows us just how much we still have to learn about @entity3			0
' a lot of people assume we 've excavated the entire site and everything we 're ever going to know about the monument is known			0
but actually there 's quite a lot we still do n't know and there 's quite a lot that can be discovered just through non-excavation methods			0
' it 's great that people who know the site really well and look at it every day were able to spot these parch marks and recognise them for what they were			0
we maintain the grass with watering when it 's very dry in the summer , but our hosepipe does n't reach to the other side of the stone circle			2
@entity13 believe the discovery has finally revealed the location of missing sarsen stones which once completed the @entity3 circle every summer stewards at the ancient monument water the site in @entity47 to keep the grass healthy and green and the earth well nourished ' if we 'd had a longer hosepipe we might not have been able to see them			1
' historians have long wondered whether @entity3 was an intentionally - incomplete circle , but countless high resolution geophysical surveys and excavations have failed to give the answer			1
staff only water the site during the driest weeks of summer , but the hosepipe does n't reach to the south - west quadrant where there is a gap in the circle			0
worker @entity111 spotted the patches on the ground - now thought to be ' stone holes ' - where the grass was more parched			1
he said : ' i was standing on the public path looking at the grass near the stones and thinking that we needed to find a longer hosepipe to get the parched patches to green up			2
' a sudden light - bulb moment in my head , and i remembered that the marks were where archaeologists had looked without success for signs that there had been stone holes , and that parch marks can signify them			2
' i called my colleague over and he saw them and realised their possible significance as well			0
not being archaeologists we called in the professionals to evaluate them			0
' i am still amazed and very pleased that simply really looking at something , that tens of thousands of people had unwittingly seen , can reveal secrets that sophisticated machinery ca n't			0

historians have long debated if the outer ring of the prehistoric stones was at one time a complete circle
but countless archaeologists have failed to find any evidence - despite numerous tests and excavations
however , when stewards went out to water the grounds , the *length* of the hosepipe meant one area was left dry
this left the ground parched and revealed where stones that have been missing could have been in place
