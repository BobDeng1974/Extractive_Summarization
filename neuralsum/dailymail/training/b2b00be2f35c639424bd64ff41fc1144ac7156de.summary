by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has admitted that crucial files which could expose historical child sex abuse are likely to have been shredded explosive dossiers allegedly revealing the identities of a paedophile ring operating at @entity9 have ‘ probably been destroyed ’ , it was revealed last night			1
the @entity11 ’s top mandarin @entity2 has admitted that crucial files which could expose historical child sex abuse are likely to have been shredded			1
on a day when the scandal at @entity9 deepened , it also emerged that : the late mr @entity15 planned to expose eight establishment figures connected to child abuse			1
but it is now understood that there are likely to be more than eight names listed in the dossier – some of which are said to be ‘ breathtaking ’			2
last year mr @entity2 , permanent secretary at the under - fire @entity11 , led a review into his department ’s handling of child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999			1
he discovered that 114 files which could have shed light on abuse – possibly involving high - ranking politicians – were missing , and four which named suspected paedophiles had never been passed to the police			1
the late mr @entity15 ( pictured ) planned to expose eight figures connected to child abuse during a stormy session of the @entity38 yesterday , he stressed that his review had failed to uncover any ‘ sinister ’ reason for their disappearance			1
but he said the files had ‘ probably ’ been destroyed after two years , rather than lost , and so could never be recovered			2
he told @entity44 : ‘ most of these files were probably destroyed , because the kind of topics that they covered would have been subject to the normal file destruction procedures			2
’ @entity11 advisers in the 1970s called for the age of consent to be lowered to 14 and sought to reduce punishment for so - called ‘ consensual ’ sex with girls as young as 12			2
an internal document from 1979 reveals that officials wanted the age of consent lowered by two years from 16 , and pressed for maximum life sentences to be reduced to no more than two years in cases of underage sex with 13 - year - olds where ‘ consent ’ could be shown			2
in cases of ‘ younger offenders ’ , greater leniency would apply when the ‘ consenting ’ victim was 12			0
today , sex with a 12 - year - old can attract a life sentence			2
@entity72 and @entity73 , the authors of the @entity11 booklet entitled @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , argued that many girls reach puberty before their 12th birthday and may initiate sex			2
in the booklet , obtained by @entity88 , the report ’s authors state : ‘ there is scope for amending the law to coincide with sentencing practice			0
could be available when victims / partners are under 13 ( perhaps limiting them in the case of younger offenders to when girls involved are under 12 )			0
’ they add : ‘ paradoxical though it might seem to argue that [ the point at which tougher sentences are applied ] should be lower than the average age of puberty [ 13 ] , it is not unreasonable			0
a large number of 12 - year - old girls have already attained puberty and may not only be willing to take part in sexual activity but may actually initiate it			0
’ however despite mr @entity2 ’s suggestion that files had been shredded , a @entity110 mp last night made the explosive claim that the dossier had been ‘ widely circulated ’ around @entity115 – and is likely to have survived			1
it has emerged that the ten - page dossier was copied and given to civil servants in other departments , all of whom had to sign the @entity122 because of the seniority of the names it contained			1
today @entity126 , mp for @entity127 , will call for the @entity122 to be lifted for this item only , to enable potential whistleblowers with copies to bring it into the public domain			0
last night mr @entity126 told the @entity133 : ‘ there are multiple copies of that dossier which were circulated at the time across other departments			1
there was a meeting at the time in @entity115 where everyone had a copy			0
’ he added : ‘ without question , there are multiple copies out there			0
all it requires is for the @entity122 to be lifted on this item in order for a copy to come forward			0
' people will then know the evidence , and there are some breathtaking names			0
’ meanwhile , mps raised the prospect that @entity156 could be storing copies of the dossier			1
the @entity159 are tasked with finding any information which could be used to blackmail mps into giving up state secrets			0
@entity156 is known to have a detailed file on the allegations against @entity165 mp and notorious paedophile @entity166 , which was passed on by police			1
@entity170 mp @entity169 said : ‘ files of a similar nature , which relate to the integrity of mps , historically have been copied by the @entity159			1
’ yesterday home secretary @entity175 said that provided there was no threat to national security , the fresh probe – led by @entity178 chief sir @entity177 – would be able to access intelligence held by @entity156 and @entity183			1
and significantly the job of assisting mr @entity177 has been given to @entity122 expert @entity185 , who has the highest possible level of security clearance			0
but the home secretary was yesterday criticised after it was revealed that mr @entity2 had only shared the ‘ broad conclusions ’ of his review with her in june			1
@entity110 ’s home affairs spokesman @entity191 said : ‘ there are clearly big questions for the home secretary to answer			0
neither she nor her senior official appear to have been briefed on its contents			0
’ @entity197 will head the panel retired judge @entity197 was yesterday appointed to head the panel investigating the establishment ’s failure to protect children from abuse by paedophiles			1
the 80 - year - old will head a wide - ranging @entity206 - style inquiry into historic abuses in @entity9 , @entity115 , churches , children ’s homes and elsewhere			2
@entity197 led the @entity212 child abuse inquiry in the late @entity213 that led to more than 100 children being removed from their families			1
more recently , she quit the inquest into the death of @entity218 , and @entity219 , admitting she did not have sufficient experience of high - profile jury cases			0
@entity2 , permanent secretary at the @entity11 , said she would not pursue individual cases of abuse , but insisted that her investigation would ‘ leave no stone unturned ’			1
@entity197 will now appoint her panel and agree the terms of reference			0
however , the inquiry is not expected to report before the general election next may			0
it does not have the power to compel witnesses to attend or take an oath , but home secretary @entity175 said it could be converted into a full public inquiry if necessary .			0

@entity2 admitted crucial files are likely to have been shredded
@entity15 planned to expose eight figures connected to child abuse
last year mr @entity2 led a review into his department ’s handling of child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999
it has emerged the ten - page dossier was copied and given to civil servants in other departments
@entity156 could be holding *incendiary* information which *unmasked* prominent figures as child sex *predators* in the 1980s ;
an *ex-child* protection *worker* said *ministers* and mps were involved in an establishment paedophile ring three decades *ago* ;
@entity197 , who led the @entity212 child abuse inquiry , was named *chairman* of a review into historical child sex abuse ;
a prominent @entity267 will join a fresh inquiry into information the @entity11 received during the period – including a 1983 dossier from now dead @entity170 mp @entity15 ;
an mp insisted that despite claims that the @entity15 dossier had been destroyed , it was widely circulated among civil servants – and copies may still survive .
