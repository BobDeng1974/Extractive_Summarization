@entity1 deputy director @entity0 resigned monday but has landed an equally cushy job that the @entity3 wo n't name or explain what new job in the @entity3 is the ousted no. 2 official at the @entity1 doing ? nobody 's saying			1
@entity7 ' @entity0 , who ran day - to - day operations at the @entity1 during its most embarrassing scandals , resigned under pressure as deputy director earlier this week			1
in what appears to be a highly unorthodox employment shuffle , @entity0 – who earned as much as $ 183,000 a year – was permitted to take an unspecified job inside the highly regarded @entity17 unit in @entity18			1
both agencies are part of the @entity3			0
but no one will disclose @entity0 's new job title , his responsibilities or how much public salary he 's earning			1
it 's a mystery whether @entity0 is investigating cases , shuffling paperwork behind a desk or supervising agents			2
@entity0 was among the last senior @entity1 official left unscathed after a shakeup that started with the forced resignation of then - director @entity33			1
four other senior leaders , including the man in charge of protection operations , were ousted last month			0
amid the upheaval , the chairman of the @entity39 , @entity41 @entity40 rep. @entity40 , and others have criticized @entity0 , saying he was at the center of bad decisions made in a sequence of @entity1 scandals			2
but until monday , when the @entity1 announced his departure in a three - paragraph statement , @entity0 's job seemed safe			1
@entity0 spent 29 years with the @entity1 , including a stint as the head of the agency 's investigations division and is nearing retirement			1
federal law enforcement officers are forced off the job at 57			0
@entity0 did not respond to messages from @entity82 emailed to him and left with the public affairs office of his new agency			0
a senior executive with the government , @entity0 could have been fired for misconduct or poor performance			0
unlike lower level government employees , very few rules protect a high - level job , said @entity92 of the nonprofit @entity93 , a professional group that advocates for top - level government workers			0
@entity1 acting director @entity95 could have transferred @entity0 within the agency or fired him outright , but @entity95 would n't have authority to transfer him to another agency within the @entity3 , @entity92 said			1
the transfer would have involved approval from top officials within the department , run by @entity3 secretary @entity103			2
@entity103 last year pledged that ' ethics in government , setting the example and remaining above reproach are essential elements of good leadership			0
' @entity103 has not commented on @entity0 's departure			2
last line of defense : the @entity1 is a living , breathing cordon of security around the @entity116 , the vice president , and other constitutional officers of government the timing of @entity0 's departure was curious			1
he was expected to testify thursday , alongside @entity95 , during a congressional hearing of the @entity39			0
@entity0 and @entity95 now are n't testifying , although @entity95 is expected to appear at a hearing later			2
@entity40 and the committee 's top @entity123 , @entity125 of @entity126 , said monday they commended the @entity1 for its recent job changes , including transferring @entity0			1
the committee is expected to hear from four former officials who concluded that poor training and management contributed to last year 's security missteps , including an incident in which a @entity136 man armed with a knife scaled a @entity57 fence and ran deep into the executive mansion before being caught			0
@entity0 was in charge of day - to - day operations at the time , and during an earlier instance when president @entity143 was allowed to ride in an elevator with an armed security contractor who had not been properly vetted by the agency			1
he was new to the job as deputy director when a group of agents were caught up in a prostitution scandal in advance of @entity143 's arrival at a @entity155 in april 2012			2
@entity0 is n't the first embattled @entity3 official to quietly transfer amid concerns about his performance			1
in december 2013 , then - acting inspector general @entity159 took another job in the department days before he was scheduled to testify before a @entity163 subcommittee investigating allegations of wrongdoing within his office			0
about five months later , @entity103 suspended @entity159 within hours of the publication of that subcommittee 's report that concluded that @entity159 was too cozy with senior department officials			0
@entity159 , who was also a senior executive in the department , remains on paid leave .			0

@entity174 ran day - to - day operations at the @entity1 while it was *dragged* through scandal after scandal
he resigned this week but landed a job at @entity3 with an investigative unit inside @entity18
the @entity143 administration wo n't say what @entity0 's new title is or what his *duties* will be , but his transfer instead of *dismissal* would have been approved at the highest levels
his salary scale at @entity1 was in the range of $ 183,000 per year
