the @entity1 is investigating the hanging death of a black @entity4 teenager after his family questioned an official ruling that he committed suicide , it was today revealed			1
@entity8 , 17 , was found hanging by a dog leash and a belt from a swing set in a largely white trailer park in @entity13 , @entity14 , less than a mile from his home , in august this year			1
although the state medical examiner ruled @entity8 's death a suicide based on reports from law enforcement and a county coroner , his family argued that it was a ' race - based homicide '			1
they pointed out that the teenager - who had no history of mental illness - had washed his uniform and packed his bag in preparation for a big football game just hours before he was found hanging			0
there was no item present he could have used to reach the bar , they said			0
some relatives even went so far as to say that @entity8 's relationship with a 31 - year - old white woman - who lived across the road from him - could have led to his death			1
the pair 's relationship had apparently not been well received by the predominantly white community			1
meanwhile , @entity8 's teammates refused to believe he had killed himself before their high school game , which the starting linebacker had reportedly spent the entire summer training for			2
one of his teammates , @entity66 , told @entity67 that his friend had huge @entity70 dreams , saying : ' he was real excited ... he was looking forward to doing good in the game			0
' as @entity8 's family , friends and teammates spread the word of their unease , a coalition of church leaders , lawyers and activists in the state called on federal authorities investigate @entity8 's death			1
@entity70 fan : although the state medical examiner ruled @entity8 's ( pictured ) death a suicide , his family argued it was a ' race - based homicide '			1
now , the government has launched a federal investigation into his death scene : @entity8 , who aspired to be an @entity70 player , was found hanged from this wooden swing set ( pictured ) the @entity4 branch of the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) claimed police had reached a ' quick four - day call ' that @entity8 had taken his own life			1
' given evidence uncovered by the ( @entity4 ) @entity97 , there are several other possible explanations for his death besides a simple suicide , ' the @entity97 said in a letter			2
the reverend @entity106 , president of the chapter of the @entity97 , said many questions remain unanswered , including why the teenager was hanging from a dog leash and a belt he did not own			1
' we do n't know what happened that terrible night , ' mr @entity106 said			0
speaking to @entity114 , he added : ' the call was made so quick			0
and what concerns us about that is that if @entity8 @entity118 was white and was found hanging in a.			2
. predominantly black trailer park that was known to have some drug involvement and other things , we just do n't believe that it would have been this quick rush to say it was a suicide			2
mother and son : @entity8 's ( right ) mother , @entity126 ( left ) , also backed calls for further investigation into her son 's death , saying : ' i just want to know what happened to my 17 - year - old son ; all i want is justice ' ' it would have been a very , very , very intense investigation			1
' @entity8 's mother , @entity126 , also backed calls for further investigation into the death of her son , ' i just want to know what happened to my 17 - year - old son ; all i want is justice , ' mrs @entity126 , who identified her son 's body in the back of an ambulance at the scene , told the @entity148			1
she dismissed the coroner 's findings that @entity8 had been depressed over his uncle 's death , saying the loss would not have driven him to suicide and that he was , in general , a very happy person			1
and she added that a number of cuts and abrasions had been found on her son 's body following his death , alongside a large bump on his head that may indicate he was hit by someone			0
speaking to @entity163 , she said : ' when i saw him , i just knew automatically he did n't do that to himself			0
gifts : mr @entity8 added that a number of cuts and abrasions had been found on @entity8 's body following his death , alongside a large bump on his head			2
above , @entity8 's friends leave gifts at the scene of the hanging tribute : candles spell out @entity176 in a tribute to the teenager , who reportedly had big @entity70 dreams ' seventeen years old — he had no reason to			0
as a mother , i would have sensed if something was wrong to the point that he was going to harm himself			0
' days after he was buried , @entity8 's grave was defiled - an act of vandalism that @entity8 's family believes supports their claim that he was killed in a racially - motivated homicide			1
following months of campaigning , the same coroner who ruled @entity8 's death a suicide has now questioned his initial verdict due to the high number of ' unanswered questions ' in the case			1
on friday morning , @entity14 district attorney , @entity204 , confirmed to @entity163 that an @entity1 agent has finally been assigned the case after being made aware of the coroner 's concerns			2
@entity8 's family hopes the probe could be the detailed investigation they have been waiting for			2
however , @entity212 , a spokesman for the @entity213 , said agents have already addressed all viable leads in the hanging			0
and the @entity218 ’s office said in a statement that it has not received any information to counter the initial ' asphyxia due to hanging ' cause of death verdict			0
' while the investigation is ongoing , and no final determinations have been made , to date we have not received any evidence of criminal wrongdoing surrounding the death , ' it said			0
the state chapter of the @entity97 has organizing a march in @entity13 , a tiny town with a largely white population of fewer than 2,000 people , on saturday			0
