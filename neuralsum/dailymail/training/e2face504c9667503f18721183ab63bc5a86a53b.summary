by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 12 january 2013 stepping through the front door of @entity2 is like going on a journey back in time			1
the timber - framed building dates from the 15th century but stands on the site of a far older medieval hall with a very colourful past			1
for centuries , @entity8 was a manor house			1
then , in the @entity12 , it was divided into two homes – @entity14			2
@entity15 : @entity2 is a 15th century manor standing on the site of a medieval seat visited by kings @entity19 and @entity20 , the owners of @entity2 , near @entity22 in @entity23 , have traced its history to before the @entity25 in 1086 , and the results of their painstaking five - year research are documented on their website , dagworth.steventon - barnes.com			1
and the house was seen last summer in the @entity31 series @entity32 when its presenter , historian @entity33 , investigated the area as a corner of @entity36			0
the first known @entity38 resident was a @entity39 called @entity40 , who farmed a large tract of land much bigger than the plot on which the dozen or so homes that make up the hamlet sit today			0
the medieval residents took the place name as their own			1
a knight called @entity50 lived at the manor from 1205			1
it remained in the family name until 1401 , with his great - grandson @entity54 ( 1306 to 1351 ) among his descendants who lived there			1
home of joy : @entity19 and @entity20 , pictured with their children @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , at @entity2 which saw the birth of their two younger sons features of the property ’s past include a mischievous ghost called @entity70 , a visit from @entity72 and his @entity73 in 1216 , and a character called @entity75 , born at @entity2 on february 14 , 1793 , who settled in @entity77 and gave his estate there the same name			1
the @entity81 - @entity80 have lived in the four - bedroom house for nine years , bringing up their young sons , @entity62 , ten , @entity61 , eight , and @entity63 , six			1
now they have put it up for sale at £ 399,995 because they are moving to give their growing boys more space			1
‘ it ’s been wonderful to live somewhere with so much history , ’ says @entity19 , 42 , a network director for @entity88			0
@entity91 is a quirky house that has undergone few structural changes – and those with a sense of romance could find their spiritual home here			0
in the double - height hallway you are immediately struck by the history : the sloping timbers , the odd - shaped windows above the stairs , and the framed portrait of @entity75 that the @entity81 - @entity100 managed to track down			1
@entity106 style : the sitting room in the @entity109 listed home has an inglenook fireplace and exposed beams the long history of @entity91 includes visits from a 13th century king , a ghost called @entity70 and a knightly owner the hall leads to a cosy family / dining room at the back of the house , complete with an old @entity121 , which is supplemented by a smaller kitchen overlooking a side garden			1
there ’s also a study converted from a lean - to , from where you can see through to the family room , and a further office in an outbuilding			2
however , the most impressive room is the main sitting room , which has a large inglenook with a log - burner , windows with garden views at both ends and exposed overhead beams , including a vast blackened @entity140 near the fireplace			2
upstairs , the four bedrooms – all different shapes with yet more exposed timbers – are as idiosyncratic as the rest of the house			0
the master bedroom has a fireplace and enough space to fit an en suite ( subject to planning permission , as the house is @entity109 listed ) , though there ’s a bathroom on this floor and a shower room downstairs			2
lots of cooking : for the hobby - @entity162 there is plenty of space to cook - this is just the supplement kitchen all the upstairs rooms have views over the gardens and countryside			2
as @entity19 points out , the landscape has remained pretty unscathed for 1,000 years , with little change to the layout of the fields			0
@entity91 ’s grounds , bounded by the @entity174 , would be a major draw for a keen gardener			0
there ’s an orchard , a large sunny terrace , roses , honeysuckle in summer , a walled children ’s play area , a wild area near the river and a lawned section			0
in the nine years @entity19 and @entity20 have lived in the hall , they have done some replastering and decorating but no major work			2
‘ i love the fact that there have been so many people here before us , ’ says @entity20 , 40			0
‘ both my younger sons were born at home			0
when i had @entity61 , i remember wondering how many people had been born in this house before him			0
it gives you a sense of belonging			0
