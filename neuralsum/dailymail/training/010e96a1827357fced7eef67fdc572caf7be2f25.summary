this is the 10,000 - room hotel that has never had a guest			1
situated on the island of @entity6 in @entity7 , the @entity4 beach resort was built by @entity8 between 1936 and 1939 as a striking show of @entity11 architecture			1
yet the project was halted , with eight separate buildings having been erected , when the @entity11 leader decided to focus on building more planes and war infrastructure			1
it was meant to provide holiday entertainment for 20,000 of @entity8 's hordes at any one time			1
but not a single @entity11 ever got to stay there			0
the ' @entity38 ' was thought to have been @entity8 's @entity11 equivalent to @entity40 , who began developing their holiday camps in 1936 throughout the @entity43			1
it was to be @entity8 's reward to the workers who had toiled long hours for the @entity11 - a bucket - and - spade resort and fun for all the family			1
it was occupied after 1945 by the @entity51 and became a top - secret @entity53 base			2
after the war , the @entity53 considered blowing it up , but discovered they did n't have enough dynamite for the job			2
instead they turned it into a massive tank - and - artillery base for the @entity60 of @entity7 and it vanished from all maps			0
it is hoped a number of rooms will be sold to the elderly , while there are plans to build a smaller hotel on site the hotel resort was meant to show off the class of @entity11 architecture - sadly it 's been left to ruin @entity4 was supposed to be the frontrunner of the @entity11 's ' strength through @entity30 ' leisure programme a museum at the site chronicles the history of @entity4 which , aside from the building of the @entity81 of coastal fortifications stretching from @entity83 to the border of @entity85 - intended to thwart any @entity87 landings in occupied @entity88 - was @entity8 's biggest building project			1
the @entity19 viewed leisure as just one more aspect of human activity to be governed by the party			0
the resort was meant to show off all the attributes @entity11 leader @entity8 wanted the people of @entity7 to demonstrate @entity4 was destined to be the forerunner of a string of such giant camps whose plans were mothballed due to the war he unleashed on the world			1
the site is currently being sold off and renovated , in the hopes it will one day again be home to tens of thousands of people			0
some of the buildings will be marketed as homes for the elderly , others luxury apartments , and still others as a 300 room hotel			2
from buildings built by the @entity19 to ornate theatres , burnt out hotels and eerie sanatoriums , these are the abandoned buildings that still litter the powerhouse of @entity88			0
photographer @entity120 , 30 , from @entity121 travelled to the @entity123 capital @entity124 and the surrounding countryside to capture buildings in need of work on film			0
far from being resplendent in vintage glory , the deserted music venues and crumbling hospitals are a shadow of their former selves			0
an abandoned former @entity135 pictured by @entity43 photographer @entity120 , 30 , from @entity121 a lecture hall at the former @entity135 training school pictured here is an abandoned theatre that has not seen a show for years the arches around a courtyard inside the old sanatorium daubed with graffiti @entity147 and @entity148 mural at @entity149 , a military complex , in @entity151 , @entity152 , created by the @entity123 during the rearmament period a barber 's chair in a manor house that once acted as a sanatorium is left to rot a gym / basketball court at @entity149			2
the @entity159 was then stationed there until its abandonment in 1992 , after the @entity53 dissolved			0

@entity4 was supposed to *showcase* the best of @entity11 architecture
yet @entity8 pulled the plug on the project before it was finished to focus on the war effort
after the war the @entity53 planned to blow the site up - but did n't have enough dynamite
plans afoot to build a 300 - room hotel , with other spaces being sold as flats
@entity123 resort was @entity8 's idea of a ' @entity40 ' - a space for family fun and entertainment
