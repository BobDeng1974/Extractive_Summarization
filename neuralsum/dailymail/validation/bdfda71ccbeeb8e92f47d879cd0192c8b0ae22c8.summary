cockroaches might not be the most beloved of all critters - but is it ethical to control their movement with mind - control technology ? that ’s a debate engineers at @entity8 are stirring with their latest ‘ robo - roach ’ device , which can control the path a cockroach takes with wireless technology			1
they have created little backpacks for the bugs and implanted electrodes into their nervous system to control their movement			1
their backpack stimulates the nervous system in the bugs ' brains ( image provided by dr @entity29 )			1
doing so allows the direction of their movement to be altered			1
it is different to previous technologies that stimulated antennae this is not the first technology to turn cockroaches into controllable insects - others have even released products you can buy to create your own remote - controlled roach			1
but previous attempts to manipulate the movements of cockroaches relied on stimulating their antennae , tricking them into avoiding objects			1
the technology developed by @entity8 , meanwhile , works by stimulating nerves in the cockroach ’s brain to allow for greater control			2
the paper , published in the @entity56 , details how the team built a small micro-controller , wireless receiver and a rechargeable lithium battery			0
these were packaged together in a ‘ backpack ’ weighing 0.007lbs ( 3g ) that was attached to the cockroach			2
next , they inserted electrodes into the body of a cockroach to stimulate its nervous system			1
by stimulating either left or right side , the team then found they could control the bug , although it only responded correctly about 60 per cent of the time			0
in tests , the researchers were able to control the movement of the cockroaches around obstacles ( shown )			2
while they can only control their direction for now , the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control , such as making it walk , run and stop on command speaking to @entity84 , lead researcher dr @entity29 said the benefits of such technology could include attaching cameras or sensors to cockroaches , and having them explore areas humans can not - such as disaster zones			1
‘ insects can do things a robot can not , ’ she said			0
‘ they can go into small places , sense the environment , and if there ’s movement , from a predator say , they can escape much better than a system designed by a human			2
‘ we wanted to find ways to work with them			0
’ while they can only control their direction for now , the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control , such as making it walk , run and stop on command			2
in november 2014 researchers from @entity114 fitted the hardy creatures with electrical backpacks complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds			0
the idea is that cyborg cockroaches , or ‘ biobots ’ , could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes , for example , and help emergency workers find survivors			0
‘ in a collapsed building , sound is the best way to find survivors , ’ said @entity128 , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at @entity129			0
‘ the goal is to use the biobots with high - resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that do n't matter - like a leaking pipe			0
‘ once we 've identified sounds that matter , we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero - in on where those sounds are coming from			0

@entity21 engineers have developed a method to control cockroach movement
their backpack stimulates the nervous system in the bugs ' brains
doing so allows the direction of their movement to be altered
it is different to previous technologies that stimulated antennae
the device could be used to explore disaster zones with cockroaches
