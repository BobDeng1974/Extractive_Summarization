@entity0 , the @entity1 former pediatric neurosurgeon whose conservative speeches have rallied the @entity4 's right wing , was accused tuesday of plagiarizing portions of a best - selling book he wrote in 2012			1
the revelation will prove embarrassing to the probable 2016 presidential contender : in the same book @entity0 describes being caught plagiarizing part of an assignment during his college years			1
in that case , the professor forgave him and allowed him to resubmit his paper ; @entity1 voters may not be as flexible			2
' @entity18 ' contains several passages lifted from other books , from a conservative website , from press releases and from an @entity1 television network , according to the entertainment @entity24			1
@entity26 ? @entity0 , a rare black luminary among the @entity4 's likely presidential condenders , stands accused or ripping parts of his 2012 book from other publications @entity0 is being urged to run for the @entity32 by a ' draft ' movement that includes a $ 12 million political action committee the largest apparent offense involves 156 words from @entity38 which appeared in the book verbatim			1
in another , 106 words from a 2011 press release issued by the @entity42 , a religious freedom group , appeared in @entity0 's book with only minor alterations – and no citation			1
the book : @entity49 scoured ' @entity18 ' and found numerous instances of apparent plagiarism and 23 words from a @entity54 online article about a 2010 ' national day of prayer ' also appear nearly identical in his text			1
@entity59 district judge @entity58 , according to both , ' ruled that the government - sanctioned [ event ] , established by @entity62 and marked with a proclamation from the president , is unconstitutional			0
' other instances cited by @entity49 are more benign , however , including several taken from books whose author , noted conservative historian @entity67 , expressly gave permission for others to use the text			2
still more are picayune by comparison , consisting of casual rearrangement of text – but lack the footnotes and acknowledgements that are customary in nonfiction publishing			0
' in many cases @entity0 cites the works that he plagiarizes in endnotes , ' @entity49 reported , ' though he makes no effort to indicate that not just the source , but the words themselves , had been taken from different authors			2
' @entity67 's book grants permission ' to duplicate 10,000 words or less , provided acknowledgement is given			0
' @entity0 's original text from ' @entity18 ' makes it clear that he 's aware of the need to carefully vet writing for the unauthorized use of other authors ' work			1
in college , he recalls , he ' found some passages that seemed particularly appropriate ' to a psychology paper he was writing , ' and i included them in my writing			2
i did not , however , indicate that this was the work of someone else ; frankly , i had never even heard of the term plagiarism			0
' with a lesson learned , his ' compassionate ' professor allowed him to re-submit his paper			0
' i certainly should have known inherently that what i was doing was wrong			0
i had done it before without consequences and probably would have continued doing it if i had not been caught , ' @entity0 wrote in the 2012 book			1
' this raises another question : is ignorance an acceptable excuse for unethical behavior ? ' the @entity49 reporter who unearthed the @entity0 plagiarism did not immediately respond to an email asking whether other political authors ' texts might be on the chopping block			1
the website has already skewered @entity129 sen. @entity128 , another shoo - in for the 2016 @entity32 race , for plagiarism			0
in his 2012 book ' @entity133 , ' @entity128 lifted entire sections of text from papers issued years earlier by conservative think tanks including the @entity138 and the @entity139			0
his publisher updated the book 's future editions with footnotes			0
in your face : @entity0 compared @entity146 to slavery in 2013 as the president looked on @entity0 , a world - renowned pediatric neurosurgeon , is reportedly gearing up for a presidential run in 2016 as a @entity4 an @entity152 political consultant who worked for two separate @entity154 campaigns in 2012 told @entity155 that this will be @entity156			1
' he 's basically toast , ' the operative said wednesday			1
' @entity128 can recover from this because he 's in the news and he 's a senator			0
' ' and his whole shtick is being a doctor , an academic			2
how does he explain this away ? ' he asked not to be identified because he does n't want to ' limit options ' for employment in the coming campaign season			0
@entity0 's book caught fire after a 2013 @entity170 speech in which he called the @entity146 health insurance law ' the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery			1
' president @entity175 was seated to his right as he spoke			0
@entity178 spokeswoman @entity177 and a spokesman for @entity180 – the conservative activist behind a political action committee urging @entity0 to run for president – did not respond to requests for comment			2
@entity184 told @entity49 , however , that “ if it is determined that additional citations or attribution are required , the appropriate revisions will be made in subsequent printings			2
' ' thank you for bringing this matter to our attention			0

@entity49 pored through @entity0 's ' @entity18 ' and found passages lifted from other sources without attribution
@entity0 wrote in the same book about being caught plagiarizing a paper in college and a professor 's mercy in letting him re-do the assignment
' is ignorance an acceptable excuse for unethical behavior ? ' he asked
the former pediatric neurosurgeon is a rare black @entity4 who could contend for the presidency in 2016
' he 's basically toast , ' an @entity154 political operative said ; ' his whole shtick is being a doctor , an academic . how does he explain this away ? '
