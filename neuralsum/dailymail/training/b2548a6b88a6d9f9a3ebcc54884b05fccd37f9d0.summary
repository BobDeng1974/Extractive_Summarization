the prime minister backed planning minister @entity8 , who caused fury last month by saying the government needs to concrete over an area of greenfield land twice the size of @entity15			1
mr @entity1 said it was not a target to build on 3 per cent more of @entity5 ’s land – the figure outlined by mr @entity8 – but he made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for new homes to be built			1
and he said the government would continue to push for the planning system to be speeded up to allow new development			1
mr @entity8 had said that about 9 per cent of land was currently developed in the @entity5 and ‘ all we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land ’ to solve the housing crisis			0
he was condemned by @entity29 , the former poet laureate who is president of the @entity30 , as ‘ incredibly irresponsible ’			0
but mr @entity1 went to his defence yesterday , telling mps that mr @entity8 was ‘ honest and honourable ’ to make his statement			1
he said : ‘ he was trying to give an exemplification of the scale of the problem			0
it is not @entity22 policy to set a target of the percentage of land to be built on			2
that 3 per cent is not going to form a target			0
‘ he was making an honest and honourable point that if we want to build more houses in @entity5 – and we have a massive housing shortage – we will on occasion have to build on some greenfield sites			1
‘ we will have to see planning permissions go ahead			2
that is a very correct thing to say			0
we have to be honest about that			0
’ in another controversial move mr @entity1 also backed the use of fracking technology to extract shale gas , saying @entity5 should ‘ keep an open mind ’ about the proposals , which critics fear could cause mini earthquakes and blight the landscape			1
firm : mr @entity1 made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for new homes to be built he said : ‘ i think it would be a big risk just to ignore what is happening in the gas market			1
we should have an open mind and we should take part in fracking and unconventional gas because this might be a revolution that we should be involved in			0
‘ if we ignored it completely , you could be giving your economy much higher energy prices than is necessary			0
’ mr @entity1 said the government wanted to hand greater control to local neighbourhoods to decide the number and kind of houses to be built in their areas			1
but he also said communities should be given incentives to accept new developments such as onshore windfarms – a plan the government is currently consulting on			2
mr @entity1 made his comments as he was quizzed by mps on the @entity93			1
in the two - hour appearance he also appeared to give ground over the government ’s plans for secret courts			2
ministers suffered a series of humiliating defeats in the @entity102 earlier this month over plans to hold civil proceedings behind closed doors in terrorism cases			0
peers demanded that judges , not politicians , should decide whether evidence from the intelligence services should be heard in public			0
‘ we want to accept as many amendments as possible without wrecking the central tenets of the bill , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
