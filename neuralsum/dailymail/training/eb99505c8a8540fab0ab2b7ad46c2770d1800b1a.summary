by @entity1 reporter published : 05:45 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 29 april 2013 the report says that blood transfusions could be to blame for @entity4 remaining dormant in the @entity6 population up to 1,000 @entity6 people could die of the human form of mad cow disease because of infected blood given to them in @entity6 hospitals , ministers have been warned			1
the human variant of mad cow disease is called @entity4 ( @entity4 )			0
it is caused by an abnormal protein called a prion			1
prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells , causing a rapid deterioration of the brain and body			0
most people who develop the disease die within one year			0
the new report published by the government ’s @entity29 said that people could have contracted the disease through blood transfusions and they estimate that 30,000 @entity6 are likely to be carrying the condition in a dormant form			1
this is double the previous estimate			0
scientists believe that the current total death toll of 176 could rise by more than five-fold as the infection has not been wiped out of the blood supply as it has been in the food chain			2
@entity42 , a former health secretary , has urged ministers to develop a nationwide screening programme for blood donors to stop future infections of @entity4 , which has the potential to cause ' horrendous deaths ' , according to a report in @entity50			1
people are no longer in danger of getting @entity4 from eating @entity6 beef , after ministers ordered the slaughter of millions of cows when the mad cow disease scandal broke in 1989			2
however , the government acknowledges that one in 2,000 @entity6 – or approximately 30,000 people - are already carriers of the infectious proteins that cause some people to develop @entity4			0
a study last summer concluded the prevalence of this ' silent ' @entity4 is likely to be twice as high as previously thought			0
these 30,000 carriers can unknowingly pass on the infectious proteins to new sufferers through donated blood			2
millions of cows were slaughtered after the @entity4 outbreak in 1989 because so little is known about @entity4 , no one knows which carriers will go on to develop the disease or whether any new cases will actually occur at all			2
there have been no new cases for two years and there are thought to be no surviving sufferers of @entity4			0
to combat the problem surrounding blood transfusions , the report suggests ministers could consider recruiting young blood donors born after 1996 once they become eligible , as they will not have eaten infected beef			1
mr @entity42 , the former @entity85 health secretary , said ' everything humanly possible should be done to develop a blood test			1
' ' there is no room at all for complacency , ' he said			0
' [ with a blood test ] , you would be able to screen every potential donor			0
' if that screening showed the incidence was higher than thought then maybe you would do it for the whole population			0
' a spokesman for the @entity100 said the government continues to encourage ' people of all ages to give blood ' , adding ' we have one of the safest blood supplies in the world '			1
' independent experts from the @entity110 on the @entity111 , tissues and organs have used this study during their considerations of measures to reduce the potential risk of transmission through blood transfusions , ' she said			1
' there is no evidence of any @entity6 clinical cases of @entity4 being linked to a blood transfusion given after 1999			1

experts believe new cases could be caused by infected blood transfusions
former health secretary @entity42 urged ministers to start screening
but @entity100 say no cases have been linked to transfusions
