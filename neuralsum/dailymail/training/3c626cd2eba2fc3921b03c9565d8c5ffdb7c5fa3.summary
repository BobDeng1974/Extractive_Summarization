as victory celebrations go , this was n't a banner moment for the @entity3 of @entity4 , @entity5			1
the entirely pee wee football team got sacked as players tried to crash through a vinyl victory banner after a game			1
the result is a hilarious pile - on as player after player hits the banner like it 's a brick wall			1
the two mothers who were holding the banner refused to let go , even as they watched the 5 - and 6 - year - olds of the @entity3 stumble head - first into disaster			2
pint - sized cheerleaders even lined the path to cheer on the conquering players			2
by the end , though , all of them were in a heap and their cheer squad was reduced to giggles			0
one even jumped with joy at the spectacle			0
the parent who posted the video on @entity53 revealed that the hilarious moment came after the team 's first home game			1
they won 24 - 0			0
at least somebody 's happy : one little cheerleader was so fully with glee by the team 's failure that she jumped with joy			0

*mighty* mites of @entity4 , @entity5 , were meant to break through a vinyl banner after *winning* their first home game
instead , the banner broke them
