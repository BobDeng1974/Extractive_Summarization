by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 19 november 2013 one of the country ’s most distinctive @entity2 dancing troupes is proud of its efforts to preserve an @entity7 tradition going back at least a century and a half			0
now it fears its days are numbered after council bureaucrats mounted an undercover operation to prove it breaches health and safety rules			2
members of the @entity16 group blacken their faces and dress in skirts for an annual festival in the @entity22 town of @entity23			2
the @entity24 may never dance at the event in @entity23 , @entity22 , which is their biggest turnout every year the group , known as the ' coconutters ' take part every year in the event which lasts around 12 hours leaders of the troupe have been presented with a dossier of evidence – including surveillance photographs taken by officials posing as spectators – showing how crowds at this year ’s event spilled on to the road			1
the parade , traditionally held on @entity41 , was almost cancelled when @entity42 demanded safety measures costing £ 1,600 , only to back down after a public outcry			1
now it has emerged that the event was secretly monitored , and the troupe has been told that in future it will have to pay for road closures or participants and spectators will have to stick to the pavement			1
yesterday leaders accused the council of trying to stamp out the tradition and said the demands were impractical			0
the group ’s treasurer , @entity55 , said : ‘ if we had to stay on the pavement , we will be dancing into lampposts and bus stops			0
people will end up with no front teeth			2
it ’s going to be more dangerous			0
’ known as the ‘ @entity64 ’ , the group has paraded in @entity23 every @entity41 for the past 110 years , although @entity2 dances have been held there since at least the mid- 19th century			1
earlier this year , after police said they could no longer afford to patrol the 12 - hour event , the council demanded £ 1,000 for road closures and £ 600 to train three volunteers to control traffic			1
it backed down and the event went ahead , attended by 800 people , raising £ 600 for the local air ambulance and a hospice			1
however , when mr @entity55 , 66 , and group secretary @entity78 attended a meeting with the council this month to discuss next year ’s 111th parade , they were stunned to see the dossier			1
the @entity42 officials allegedly posed as spectators at the event and then compiled a dossier claiming the dancers and their audience were breaching health and safety regulations the council has demanded the group restrict their energetic dancing to the pavement during the 12 - hour - long festival the @entity24 have faced problems with @entity42 in the past			1
they were requested to pay for road closures and train members of the troupe to direct traffic ahead of one year 's event ‘ first it was shock that the pictures had been taken without us knowing , ’ mr @entity55 , a retired fireman , said yesterday			1
‘ then it was knowledge they were prepared to go down that road of covert pictures to get the event banned			1
‘ it ’s all this red tape and health and safety ruling the roost and going over the top at the expense of our finest @entity7 traditions			0
’ last night @entity22 county council ‘ strongly disputed ’ the dancers ’ claim that the parade had been subject to secret monitoring			2
it said : ‘ we told them in advance our traffic management people would be there to observe – our guys were there in high - visibility jackets with the council logo on			2
’ but mr @entity55 said : ‘ that ’s a lie			0
we did n’t know anything about it until we were shown the photographs			0
’ the troupe from @entity23 , @entity22 , is over 150 years old with their origins dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries the event in @entity23 is the group 's largest and most important performance of the year with over 800 people attending last year the traditional @entity148 involves eight dancers and one ' whipper in ' who leads proceedings			1
the dance is believed to have been thought up by @entity154 who travelled to @entity155 before settling in @entity22 in the 1700 - 1800s			0
the theatrical performance includes flower hoops or garlands , extravagant costume and black face - paint , to ward off evil spirits			2
though their painted faces have been thought to mimic labourers from the past , the group insists the tradition stems back to a pagan method of disguise			0
while the majority of @entity2 dancers wear bell pads on their shins , the @entity169 rely on their wooden clogs and an accompanying concertina for music			0
the earliest known form of @entity2 dancing dates back to 1448			0
the traditionally @entity180 dance has become popular abroad too , with more than 150 registered dance troupes in foreign countries			0
@entity42 claim to have explained their concerns to the dance troupe following a meeting at which local police were also present the dance troupe is expected to reconvene to discuss the proposals made by council officials			1
