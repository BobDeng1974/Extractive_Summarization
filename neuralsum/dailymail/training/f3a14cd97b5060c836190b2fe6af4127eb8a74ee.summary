@entity0 is not the sort to fret over his future but if he took time this week while @entity3 unwind in @entity4 to glance at what is happening elsewhere then he would have been given much @entity8 food for thought			1
@entity0 still looks certain to be part of @entity3 ’s opening @entity8 line up against @entity4 on february 14 but , at 29 , is approaching the last chance to finally realise the rich potential that has all too often remained unfulfilled			1
there is competition both near and far now for an all - rounder whose poor tri-series is one of the major concerns for an @entity3 side who , despite three defeats by @entity4 , have made quiet progress so far in their @entity8 build - up			1
@entity0 's @entity3 form is a major concern ahead of the upcoming @entity8 the @entity3 star , in action against @entity4 on sunday , still have so much to prove @entity0 leaves the field of play on sunday as @entity4 celebrate taking his wicket @entity33 is nearing full fitness after a broken finger and looks set to be given a chance by @entity3 to push for @entity0 ’s place in one of their warm - up matches here in @entity41 against @entity42 and @entity43 next week			1
more seriously for @entity0 ’s long - term prospects , the spectacular hitting of @entity45 for the @entity46 in @entity47 has confirmed the return to form of a special talent who will be an important part of @entity3 ’s future			1
it is frustrating that @entity0 , approaching his third @entity8 , still has so much to prove as he remains a gifted batsman and a bowler who should provide a valuable option for @entity3 , particularly on the slower pitches of @entity59			1
yet @entity0 , who was also under - used in @entity60 with the ball before @entity62 , was given just three overs by @entity64 during the tri-series , conceding 24 runs , while @entity67 has established himself as fifth bowler			2
@entity0 , pictured in the nets last week , is approaching his third @entity8 for @entity3 @entity0 managed only seven off 16 balls in @entity71 , but his ability should note be doubted and if @entity0 ’s bowling becomes less useful then there will be more scrutiny on batting which saw him struggle for seven off 16 balls in @entity71 when @entity3 needed acceleration against @entity4 and play an awful shot against @entity79 at the @entity80 when a cool head was needed			2
it was only in @entity60 that @entity0 was promoted to five and looked to have been given more opportunity to build longer one - day innings rather than just provide cameos at seven or seek to become @entity3 ’s finisher			2
he is back at six now but will find @entity87 breathing down his neck if he takes the chance that looks sure to come his way at the @entity91 next week			0
@entity0 ’s ability should not be doubted			0
when he was scoring three centuries in consecutive test innings against @entity43 six years ago he looked certain to become a permanent fixture			0
there have also been spectacular one - day innings for @entity98 but only one 50 - over century for @entity3 , and that came against @entity100			0
@entity33 is closing in on a return from a broken finger and could push @entity0 for a place in the line - up @entity45 celebrates scoring a century for the @entity46 in their odi match against @entity47 there will be those , like @entity108 , who bemoan the fact @entity45 is not with the @entity8 squad and able to replace @entity0 now but the selectors had little option other than to leave him out when they picked the squad			1
the @entity116 all - rounder ’s international form collapsed with both bat and ball after he returned from @entity4 this time last year and it was when he continued to struggle in @entity60 that @entity3 , with heavy hearts , omitted him			0
what one would say is that @entity45 was not helped by being treated as a bowling all - rounder and he showed , not least with his 15 sixes in @entity124 , that he should very much be treated predominantly as a batsman when he returns			0
that day will come if @entity3 have an injury here or more likely when they start again in one - day cricket after the @entity8 when it is to be hoped that @entity130 and @entity131 will also feature in 50 and 20 over cricket			2
for now @entity3 have the squad most would have picked in december and it is hard to argue against it being the right one for the here and now			0
but the big question is whether @entity0 can justify his inclusion in it .			0

@entity0 is certain to be part of @entity3 's opening @entity8 line - up
but his poor form in the tri-series is one of the major concerns for @entity3
@entity33 is nearing a return from injury and could push @entity0
@entity0 is set for his third @entity8 but he still has so much to prove
