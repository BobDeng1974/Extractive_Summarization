i have heard that @entity2 right back @entity1 can lift other players above his head in the gym			1
he likes to be the strongman and he likes to express that in games			2
his physique is more akin to a centre half , but he ’s become one of the best right backs we ’ve ever seen			1
take a look at full backs playing today ; they are becoming more dainty			2
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are quick and direct , but they ’re not powerhouses			0
@entity2 's @entity1 has become one of the best right backs we ’ve ever seen they need to be quick to get up and down the flank			1
but @entity1 is like a tank ; everything bounces off him and he fires missiles too			1
a defender , by nature , is always very reliable in his performance but when he starts scoring too you start regarding him as really special			0
@entity31 was like that at @entity33			0
when we seemed pushed into a corner ; when we were in trouble in games , he could come up with something			0
defenders are usually tough and switched on at the back			0
when they go beyond that , they get out of their comfort zone			0
@entity1 is happy to do that time and again , producing big moments when they are most needed			1
his build sets him apart from other decent right backs of the @entity48 era such as @entity49 and @entity50			2
@entity1 is a danger man , producing big moments and scoring important goals @entity49 was a leader at @entity52 and he set an example by his performances on the pitch			1
@entity50 was also strong and consistent			0
but @entity1 matches them defensively and is much better going forward			1
not in the conventional way that some fast full - backs are great at dribbling down the flank and getting in crosses			2
you wo n’t see @entity1 beat a man with a bit of skill or glide past someone on the wing , but then you wo n’t see him get beaten either , however fast the opposition player is			1
no , when @entity1 gets in that penalty box he is a bull			1
he charges around , thrashing out at opponents and muscling them aside to make space			0
from set - pieces he ’s difficult to get hold of			2
he gets into dangerous positions and when he gets the better of an opponent he punishes them			0
@entity2 manager @entity77 sees a lot of himself in @entity1 @entity77 would look at him more than anyone else at @entity2 and say : ‘ that ’s me on the pitch			1
’ we all saw his bloodied white boot after the @entity85 semi-final win against @entity86			0
@entity77 said he had the mentality of a champion after he headed the winner			1
a manager wants steely determination in his players — and @entity1 is the epitome of that			1
when you ’re in trouble he is the sort you want with you , fighting for the cause			0
while @entity77 creates that them - versus - us mentality around the club , which he likes to do , @entity1 is his general on the field			1
@entity1 has made a massive contribution to @entity2 since £ 9m arrival from @entity105 in 2008 since @entity1 signed from @entity105 for £ 9million — a steal — in january 2008 he has played 202 @entity48 games , crunched 423 tackles , made 309 interceptions and booted away 976 clearances			1
on top of that he ’s weighed in with 19 goals - — crucial ones included			2
his only weakness , i find , is he can get caught up in the strongarm tactics at times			0
we saw him explode against @entity117 and clash with @entity118 , putting his arms around his neck and pushing his head into him			0
he escaped punishment for that , but he wo n’t always get away with them			0
it could cost him bookings and suspensions			0
@entity1 is becoming irreplaceable in that @entity2 team and they can ill afford to lose him .			2

@entity1 has become one of the best right backs we *'ve* ever seen
he is like a tank , everything bounces off him and he fires missiles too
@entity77 would look at him and say : ' that ’s me on the pitch '
