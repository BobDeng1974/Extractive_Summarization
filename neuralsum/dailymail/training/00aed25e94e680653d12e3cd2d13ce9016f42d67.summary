by @entity0 kids in the @entity2 have been getting fatter since the turn of the century			0
childhood obesity rates have increased over the past 14 years , according to a new study published on this week			1
the new findings conflict directly with official government health researchers who claimed less than two months ago there had been a sharp drop in preschool obesity rates over the past decade			1
gaining : childhood obesity is on the rise in the @entity2 after all , according to a new report after a 14 year study the ' good news ' , announced in february by researchers at the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , received widespread media coverage and prompted first lady @entity19 to say she was ' thrilled at the progress that had been made over the last few years			1
however , the new study , published in the medical journal @entity23 , used the same data source as the @entity17 , but analyzed obesity rates over a different timeframe			1
it found increases in obesity for children age 2 to 19 , and a marked rise in the percentage who were severely obese			1
@entity34 of the @entity35 at @entity36 , who led the new study , said the main message of her analysis is that childhood obesity rates have not improved			1
' i do n't want a study like the previous one to change the national discourse , ' she told @entity44 , referring to the @entity17 's work			2
obesity experts had already begun to question the large drop reported by the @entity17 for children ages 2 to 5			1
in their february paper the @entity17 scientists themselves acknowledged the statistical limitations of their data			2
@entity17 researcher @entity53 , who led the study released in february , said in response that her report described trends over the last 10 years and found ' an apparent decline in obesity among children ages 2 - 5 ( which we said in the paper should be interpreted cautiously )			1
' ' we 're confident in our analysis for this time period , ' she wrote in an email to @entity44 on monday , data : the analysis is based on 14 years of data from the @entity71 of 26,690 children aged 2 to 19 the february report from the @entity17 found that the rate of obesity among children ages 2 to 5 fell to 8.4 percent in 2011 - 2012 from 13.9 percent in 2003 - 2004			1
@entity34 and her colleagues used the same data as the @entity17 researchers , from the @entity71 , but looked at a few additional years			2
' in 2003 there was an unusual spike in the number for whatever reason - probably an error , ' @entity34 said			0
' when you take a long view from 1999 to now , you do n't see that decline			0
' about 27,000 @entity2 children between the ages of 2 and 19 were included in the survey between 1999 and 2012			0
children are considered obese when their body mass index , a measure of weight in relation to height , exceeds that of 95 percent of their peers of the same age and sex			0
expanding waistline : though the analysis indicates the prevalence of all forms of obesity have increased overall , the rate increases were most significant among @entity108 females and black males			0
overall , obesity rates increased from 14.5 percent in the 1999 - 2000 survey to 17.3 percent in 2011 - 2012			0
there was also a marked increase in the rate of severe obesity over the study period , the researchers found			2
among preschoolers age 2 to 5 , the rate was slightly lower , but that could have been due to chance			0
' even though we do n't see huge increases in the rates of children who are overweight or obese , there are clearly more in the categories that are severely obese , ' @entity34 said			0
there were especially noticeable increases in the rates of severe obesity among black boys , @entity108 girls and white girls , @entity34 said			0
rates for all obesity categories remained relatively unchanged between the 2009 - 2010 and 2011 - 2012 surveys			0
@entity34 said there is some evidence that intensive weight loss can be beneficial for overweight and obese children , but intensive weight loss programs are not widely available			1
referring to the @entity17 's conclusion that obesity among preschoolers had fallen 43 percent , dr @entity147 , medical director for the @entity148 and @entity149 at @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152 , said , ' we definitely have to look to see what the results are over the next few years to see if that 43 percent drop is sustained and a true decline			2

latest report suggests no real progress has been made when it comes to *combating* childhood obesity
the share of children and teens who are *extremely* obese actually went up
all obese children are likely to become obese *adults*
findings conflict @entity17 study that found obesity levels had decreased
