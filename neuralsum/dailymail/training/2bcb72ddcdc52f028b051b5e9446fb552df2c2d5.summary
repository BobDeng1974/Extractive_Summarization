by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:48 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 15:15 est , 16 april 2013 the highest @entity4 officials during the @entity6 presidency bore ultimate responsibility for the ' indisputable ' use of torture , according to the report from an independent task force , and it urged president @entity12 to close the @entity14 detention camp by the end of 2014			1
in one of the most comprehensive studies of @entity4 treatment of terrorism suspects , the panel concluded that never before had there been ' the kind of considered and detailed discussions that occurred after 9/11 directly involving a president and his top advisers on the wisdom , propriety and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody			1
' ' it is indisputable that the @entity4 engaged in the practice of torture , ' the 11 - member task force said in their 577 - page report			1
shut it down : a new report claims that @entity14 , seen here in 2002 not long after it opened , may be closed after @entity43 pulls out from @entity44 in 2014 the scathing critique of methods used under the @entity48 administration of former president @entity6 also sharpened the focus on the plight of inmates at @entity14 , which @entity6 opened and his @entity53 successor has failed to close			1
@entity12 banned abusive interrogation techniques such as waterboarding when he took office in early 2009 , but the widely condemned military prison at the @entity4 @entity57 in @entity58 has remained an object of condemnation by human rights advocates			2
the panel was assembled by the nonpartisan @entity63 think tank and their findings come as 45 inmates are carrying out a hunger strike in protest of their treatment			0
a clash between guards and prisoners at the @entity14 last weekend and the release of harrowing accounts by inmates about force - feeding of hunger strikers threw a harsh spotlight on the predicament of the inmates , many held without charge or trial for more than decade			0
the task force called the indefinite detention of prisoners at @entity14 ' abhorrent and intolerable ' and called for it to be closed by the end of 2014 when @entity43 's combat mission in @entity44 is due to end and most @entity4 troops will leave			2
by then , the 166 @entity14 prisoners should be tried in civilian or military courts , repatriated or transferred to countries that would not torture them , or moved to @entity4 jails , the task force 's majority recommended			1
past and present : the report focused on the rules put into place during president @entity6 's terms , but also called on president @entity12 for failing to changed much of the egregious protocols but the 2014 goal will be hard to achieve because of legal , legislative and political obstacles @entity12 faces			1
while the @entity107 says he remains committed to shutting @entity14 , he has offered no new path to doing so in his second term			0
the panel , which included leading politicians from both parties , two @entity4 retired generals and legal and ethics scholars , spent two years examining the @entity4 treatment of suspected militants detained after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
members of the task force described themselves as the closest thing to a ' truth commission ' since @entity12 decided early in his presidency against convening a national commission to investigate post- 9/11 practices			0
panel members interviewed former @entity126 , @entity6 and @entity12 administration officials , military officers and former prisoners , and the investigation looked at @entity4 practices at @entity14 , in @entity44 and @entity132 and at the @entity134 's former secret prisons overseas			1
tense : the guards , seen here in 2007 , recently fired on some of the prisoners during an altercation the task force was chaired by @entity140 , a @entity48 former congressman and undersecretary of the @entity143 during the @entity6 administration , and @entity145 , a @entity53 former congressman who served as @entity4 ambassador to @entity147			1
in a finding the panel said was its most notable and was reached ' without reservation , ' the report said , ' torture occurred in many instances and across a wide range of theaters			2
' renewed calls : protests were held in @entity158 last week calling for a closure of the prison but the panel concluded there was ' no firm or persuasive evidence ' that the use of such techniques yielded ' significant information of value			0
' ' the nation 's highest officials bear some responsibility for allowing and contributing to the spread of torture , ' the report said , though it did not name names			2
the task force , while concluding that @entity4 and international laws were violated , did not recommend legal action against any of those involved but it did press for tighter rules to prevent a recurrence of torture			1
' we as a nation have to get this right , ' @entity140 told a news conference at the @entity187 in @entity188			0
the panel urged the @entity4 government to release as much classified information as possible to help understand what went wrong and cope better with the next crisis			2
' publicly acknowledging this grave error , however belatedly , may mitigate some of those consequences and help undo some of the damage to our reputation at home and abroad , ' the report said			0
the sweeping report cataloged abusive interrogation techniques such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and chaining prisoners in painful positions			0
the task force also concluded that force - feeding hunger striking detainees is a form of abuse and should end			0
' but at the same time the @entity4 has a legitimate interest in preventing detainees from starving to death , ' the panel said .			0
