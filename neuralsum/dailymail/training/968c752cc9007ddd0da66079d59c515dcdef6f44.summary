to many , it would seem the epitome of paradise - an idyllic isle thousands of miles from civilisation where the worst noise pollution comes from the azure sea gently lapping the shore			2
but no - one can be persuaded to live there , for love nor money			1
the colony on the remote @entity13 , which were largely populated in the late 1700s when mutineers on the @entity15 washed ashore , is under threat of dying out			1
faced with a rapidly ageing population and with no children having been born there for more than four years , the inhabitants are desperately trying to attract new residents			1
but the task is proving far harder than they hoped , in large part due to its dark past of child sex abuse that continues to haunt the community to this day			1
@entity13 officials have been trying to raise the population up to 80 for three years with an impassioned plea for new people to join their tiny community remote location : the island is believed to have been inhabited by @entity46 for hundreds of years , but the first @entity48 encounter came when captain @entity50 's @entity49 stumbled across it in 1767 cut off from civilisation : the islands are more than 3,000 miles from @entity54 and 1,000 miles from @entity55 in 2004 , six men were jailed for child sex offences in a scandal that made headlines around the world			1
get past that and there is still the problem of a severe shortage of job opportunities			2
@entity13 officials have been trying to raise the population up to 80 for three years with an impassioned plea for new people to join their tiny community			1
but only one person has applied to make the move to the island , located some 3,000km from @entity54 and 1,000km from @entity55			0
the island is believed to have been inhabited by @entity46 for hundreds of years , but the first @entity48 encounter came when capt @entity50 's @entity49 stumbled across it in 1767			2
the bulk of the island 's ancestors arrived 22 years later when the @entity15 arrived , led by @entity76			1
the eight mutineers from the vessel settled on the island with six @entity46 men and twelve women from @entity55 that they brought with them			2
but paradise did not last and , within four years , only four mutineers and ten women and their children remained , with the rest murdered because of ill treatment or jealousy			2
the island features beautiful scenery and wildlife but that does n't seem to be enough to attract new residents fewer than 50 islanders - including @entity93 ( above ) - live in @entity94 , the smallest capital in the world bleak future : @entity13 residents wave off a boat of tourists			1
only one person has applied to relocate there it is not the only black mark in the history of the island after a child abuse scandal rocked the community in 2004			1
eleven years ago , six men , including the @entity13 mayor @entity109 , were jailed for a string of sex offences , meaning that almost half of the island 's male population were locked up			1
now the islanders face a race against time to restore its image and the population			0
fewer than 50 islanders live on the isolated rock in @entity94 , the smallest capital in the world , and the average age is now more than 50 years old			1
@entity13 - born @entity124 , 44 , said : ' we 've been appealing for more people to boost the population and we 've had many inquiries , but only one person has applied to move to @entity13			1
' the reality is that we do n't really have any jobs to offer			0
' @entity130 used to sell stamps to raise funds but , of course , stamp collecting is not as popular as it once was			0
' and the ships that go between @entity13 and @entity54 were scrapped			2
' the island has been surviving on government aid since 2004 and now we are trying to become self - sufficient again			2
' @entity124 , like many @entity13 children , left the island at the tender age of 12 to go to a boarding school in @entity54 and did not return to the island for 20 years			1
but she insists that the lure of the island 's beautiful vistas could not keep her away forever			0
ageing population : @entity145 holds a nail from the @entity15 in his workshop on the island history : a cannon from the @entity15 is proudly displayed in front of @entity145 's house on the island remote : the @entity13 are the last @entity31 territory in the @entity32 the island 's representative in @entity48 , @entity124 said : ' the journey to the island feels like the middle of nowhere			1
' but once you are there , you are as connected as anywhere else - the island has electricity and internet now			0
it is like a completely different world being there			0
' it 's a special place and it 's beautiful seeing the stars without light pollution and there are the bluest waters you 've ever seen			0
' the island now hopes to move past their history to attract more visitors			0
one visitor @entity177 , 56 , from @entity178 , in the @entity179 , has made the long trip to the island on four occasions since 2010 , spending up to a month in @entity94			0
the electronics shop owner , who left his native @entity183 aged six to sail around the world with his family , owns the biggest collection from the @entity15 in private hands			2
he said : ' i was given a book about the @entity15 by my dad as a kid and i made a promise to my adult self that i would go			1
' and it did n't disappoint			0
in fact , it far exceeded my expectations			0
' if the world came to an end the islanders would still survive , it 's a totally different lifestyle			0
' the first thing you realise when you get to the island is that you can just feel the history of the place when you set foot on dry land			0
' the @entity209 took place in 1789 when captain @entity211 was ousted by his second - in - command , @entity76			0
@entity211 was cast adrift in a dinghy and later landed on the island of @entity215 , in the then @entity216 , from where he travelled back to @entity31			2
the mutineers first sailed to @entity55 , dropping off 16 of their number			0
@entity76 , eight mutineers and 18 @entity221 - six men and 12 women - then set sail to avoid apprehension , landing on @entity13 in 1790			1
populated by adventurers : the painting @entity228 showing @entity15 leaving her infamous captain @entity211 adrift in small boat with a cadre of loyal men somewhere near @entity234 the @entity55 - based mutineers were recaptured in 1791			1
three were later executed after a trial			0
in 1793 , the mutineers and the male @entity221 fought a war , that killed all the male @entity221 and four of the mutineers , including @entity241			0
by the time a @entity179 ship visited in 1808 , only one mutineer , @entity244 , was still alive , with nine women and some children			0
the population has dropped from 250 in the 1930s to 50			2
@entity249 : the bulk of the island 's ancestors arrived in the late 1700s when the @entity15 - the @entity31 naval vessel on which a mutiny occurred in 1790 - washed up on the isle , led by @entity76 ( above )			1

only 50 people live on @entity13 , the last @entity31 territory in the @entity32
faced with ageing population - and last child was born there four years ago
inhabitants have made impassioned plea for people to join their community
@entity269 harbours dark past after six men were jailed for child sex abuse in 2004
