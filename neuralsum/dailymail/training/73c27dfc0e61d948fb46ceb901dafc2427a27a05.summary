by @entity0 it is the image that sums up international relations in the internet age			0
analysis of more than ten million emails has revealed which countries get along and which do not			1
a team of computer researchers have studied millions of emails from @entity10 and have discovered that emails are most frequently sent between countries with certain similarities			1
a team of computer researchers have studied millions of emails from @entity10 and have discovered that emails are most frequently sent between countries with certain similarities			1
the researchers analysed emails over a period of 6 months in 2012			1
they worked out the user 's location from their ip address , and anonymised the data so users could not be traced			0
the research , by @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity30 ’s @entity29 , suggests that how many emails are exchanged between two countries is dependent upon their relative gdp , language and trade relations			1
the study also revealed that countries with tangible ties – such as a shared border , regular interconnecting flights , and close trade relationships – share the most emails			1
in the journal @entity45 the researchers wrote : ‘ the ﬁndings ( unsurprisingly ) support the idea that geography , transportation and administrative decisions are all important determinants of between - country communication : distance decreases density , as do visas , while direct ﬂights increase it			2
’ however , there were some surprises			0
the research revealed that people in different countries of the @entity65 email far less than the scientists predicted			1
it also showed that people in countries with colonial ties do not email more as a result			1
the researchers wrote : ‘ our ﬁndings in the main model with respect to contiguous borders and common @entity65 membership appear surprising , as they decrease rather than increase density			2
' the @entity79 ( left ) unsurprisingly has strong links with the rest of the world			0
@entity83 ( right ) , however , appears almost as an ' island ' at the bottom of the image ‘ these curious ﬁndings do raise the issue of potential problems with @entity91 integration , as well as of the higher potential for conﬂict between countries sharing borders , which may lead to less communication			2
' in @entity98 , @entity97 argued that the primary axis of global conflict was no longer ideological or economic but cultural and religious , and that this division would characterize the ' battle lines of the future			0
' we focused on the flows of interpersonal communication as a bottom - up view of international alignments			0
' to that end , we mapped the locations of the world ’s countries in global email networks to see if we could detect cultural fault lines			2
' our analysis shows that email flows are consistent with @entity97 ’s thesis			0
' in addition to location in @entity124 ’s “ civilizations , ” our results also attest to the importance of both cultural and economic factors in the patterning of inter-country communication ties			0

ten million @entity10 emails were analysed to see which countries get on
emails are sent most often between people in countries with similarities
tangible ties also increase the number of emails exchanged
