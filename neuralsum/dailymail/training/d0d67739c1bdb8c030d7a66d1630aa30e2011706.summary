@entity0 was given a straight red card for @entity1 against @entity7 on saturday
despite having just *10* *men* the @entity42 leaders won the match 2 - 1
the *29* - year - old was sent off for kicking @entity7 *defender* @entity5
prior to that @entity0 had slapped @entity8 - which went unseen by the referee @entity21
however , the eventual red card was *n't* regarded as violent conduct *meaning* the @entity58 star could get away with just a two - match ban
if the slap is included in the referee 's report though , @entity0 's ban could stretch to three games
