by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:30 est , 3 february 2014 from kale chips to wheatgrass shots , the list of celebrity food crazes is a long one			1
now there 's a new source of sustenance to add to the list - an @entity12 cereal named teff			1
loved by @entity14 and @entity15 , the grain , which is a staple food in its home country @entity18 , is packed with protein , calcium and iron			1
it does , however , come with a @entity24 style price tag - retailing at an eye - watering £ 7 for a 400g bag of flour			2
superfood : @entity29 , an @entity12 staple , is set to be 2014 's coolest cupboard essential according to foodies dubbed the ' new quinoa ' , teff , which was used to feed animals until recently , has also found favour with foodies who point to its nutty flavour and wide range of uses			1
but although it has made inroads with the a-list , the rest of us do n't appear quite so keen to follow suit with @entity48 's @entity47 saying people still are n't fully aware of the health benefits			1
' it has been a slow start , ' he admits			2
' we are often the first to offer new products so there is always a strong need to educate customers and this takes time , much the same as when we first listed quinoa and people pronounced it qui - no - a , but our customers are quick to catch on			2
' he added : ' the market for gluten - free has soared in the past couple of years , but many retailers have turned to white rice and corn as a wheat substitute			2
' what our customers are seeking are gluten - free wholegrain alternatives which offer much higher nutritional benefits and teff , like quinoa , fits the criteria			0
' a-list fans : @entity14 and @entity15 are both fans of the @entity12 staple traditional : @entity29 is used to make injera , a flat bread used like medieval trenchers as both plate and side dish but it seems that @entity85 shoppers are n't the only ones who need a lesson in the nutritional benefits of @entity29			1
@entity91 owner of @entity29 , has been eating the super food her whole life but admits she had no idea it had so much to recommend it , telling the @entity97 that she was ' flabbergasted ' when she discovered its nutritional value			0
' i did n't know it was so sought after , ' she revealed			0
' i am of @entity12 origin ; i 've been eating injera [ traditional @entity12 bread made from @entity29 ] all my life			1
' despite its nutritional advantage over contenders such as millet , spelt and quinoa , teff does have one downside - a higher calorie count			0
with 286 calories per cup , teff is positively fattening compared bulgar wheat 's meagre 152 calories and quinoa 's 222			0
that , however , is no reason to forgo tucking into teff , according to @entity91 , who argues that its nutritional value more than makes up for the extra calories			0
' i ’m a big advocate of trying it in more traditional @entity124 dishes so everyone can enjoy the associated health improvements , ' she explains			1
' the teff cereals can be enjoyed on their own , or mixed into a regular muesli for a nutritious start to the day , for example ; and our breads run from plain to onion seed , sunflower seed or raisin bread , so there are options for toast and sandwiches as well as afternoon tea			0
' what is it ? @entity29 is classified as a variety of millet			0
it has small , round @entity147 : it is unlikely to cause allergies and is easy to digest			0
@entity150 in silica , a mineral with beneficial effect on bones , skin and connective @entity156 to do with it : boil and use in the same savoury ways as rice			0
can also be used to make a ' rice ' pudding if you boil with milk and add fruit and brown @entity167 : 286 calories , 56.8g carbohydrate , 8.4g protein			1

the cereal is said to contain lots of iron , protein and calcium
a-list fans include @entity15 and @entity14
used to make injera , a traditional @entity12 *flatbread*
