but badly - fitting wood burning stoves can be lethal , the @entity5 is warning , silently and fatally leaking carbon monoxide into people â€™s living rooms			1
about 40 people die in a year across @entity11 and @entity12 from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning such as that caused by wood burning stoves			1
badly - fitting wood burning stoves can be lethal , silently and fatally leaking carbon monoxide into homes ( stock picture of a properly fitted stove ) and 4,000 more need to be treated in accident and emergency for @entity23 poisoning			1
now the @entity5 has launched a winter campaign to raise awareness of the hazard			0
dr @entity27 of the @entity5 said : ' many of these deaths take place between november and february due to faulty fossil fuel and wood burning appliances , and are therefore preventable			0
' to lower the risk , people should ensure that their fossil fuel and wood burning appliances are regularly checked by an appropriately registered engineer			2
the @entity5 has launched a winter campaign to raise awareness of the hazard and has advised people to fit @entity23 alarms ' the @entity5 recommends that people have these appliances and their flues checked before the start of winter			1
' rooms in which appliances are used must also be adequately ventilated			0
' @entity23 is produced when fossil fuels burn without a good supply of air			2
it is a colourless , odourless and tasteless gas which is difficult to detect			0
and if that happens in a room without adequate ventilation , levels can build up dangerously			0
a mild case of @entity23 poisoning can just cause a very bad headache			1
but inhaling high levels can quickly starve major organs like the heart , brain and nervous system of oxygen , and if someone is exposed to high levels of @entity23 for too long , they can fall unconscious and die within minutes			1
the @entity5 is recommending that people should fit an audible @entity23 alarm which meets @entity67 , in their homes			2
dr @entity27 said telltale signs of carbon monoxide emissions included ' black sooty marks ' on the wall around stoves , boilers or fires , or on the clay radiator bars of gas fires , and smoke accumulating in rooms due to faulty flues			1
another sign was yellow flames on gas appliances that were meant to have blue flames			0
the @entity5 advises that if you see any of these signs , turn off the appliance , open your windows and have an appropriately registered engineer service the appliance as soon as possible .			0

around 40 people die in a year across @entity11 and @entity12 from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning
and 4,000 more need to be treated in accident and emergency for @entity23 poisoning
