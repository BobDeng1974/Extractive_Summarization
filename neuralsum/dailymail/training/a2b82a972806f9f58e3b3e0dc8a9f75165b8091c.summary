@entity0 swore in @entity1 as its second elected president on monday , embarking on a new era with a national unity government poised to confront a resilient @entity6 insurgency by signing an agreement with the @entity8 that would guarantee a continuing @entity8 military presence			1
as @entity11 left the political stage , the new president was locked into an uneasy partnership with his defeated rival , @entity15 , who became the country 's first chief executive			1
with a hug for the cameras , both sides appeared determined to reach across factions and avoid a descent into an abyss similar to what has happened in @entity26 , where the government 's failure to mend lingering sectarian divisions following a full @entity8 withdrawal helped give rise to the brutal @entity33 group			1
that number of troops is expected to be cut in half by the end of 2015 , and the @entity8 would leave only about 1,000 in a security office after the end of 2016			1
@entity11 , the outgoing president , had refused to approve the deal , which is intended to help @entity0 security forces combat the resilient @entity6 insurgency			1
the @entity0 government also is expected to sign an agreement this week with @entity63 that would outline the parameters of 4,000 to 5,000 additional international troops - mostly from @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 - to stay in @entity0 in a noncombat role after the end of this year			1
without a post- 2014 residual force , @entity8 military officials say there is a risk that the @entity0 security force will deteriorate , units would run out of fuel , pay systems would fail and there would be a reduction in the overall readiness of the @entity0 police and army			1
swearing in : at a handover ceremony in the country 's capital @entity39 this morning , @entity1 ( centre left ) was formally named president			1
the event marked @entity0 's first ever democratic transfer of power they say @entity94 is in ' survival mode ' in @entity0 , but that if all international forces left this year , the terrorist network would see it as a victory , regroup and again use the region to plan and conduct operations against the @entity101			1
but there are serious questions about the ability of the @entity0 security forces to take on the militants , even with a residual @entity8 force - down from a high of more than 130,000 @entity8 and @entity63 troops in @entity0 several years ago			1
' @entity0 does n't have the full military necessary to defend the country , ' said @entity112 , a member of the @entity0 parliament			2
' no air force , no tanks , limited artillery			0
' @entity8 @entity119 chairman rep. @entity118 ' @entity117 , @entity120 , said monday that he hoped president @entity43 will view the signing of the security agreement as a ' roadmap for a robust continued engagement , and not a path to premature withdrawal			1
' setting aside rivalries : moments after @entity1 took the presidential oath , he swore in his election challenger , @entity15 ( centre ) as chief executive @entity117 also wants the administration to rethink its plans to draw down @entity8 forces			1
' we are witnessing now in @entity26 what happens when the @entity8 falters on that commitment and adopts a posture inconsistent with our security interests , ' @entity117 said			2
@entity8 - @entity0 relations will likely improve under @entity1 , a 65 - year - old numbers - based technocrat who worked at the @entity144			1
@entity11 , the country 's only leader since the 2001 @entity8 - led invasion , frequently criticized the @entity8 government and irritated @entity8 leaders with his mercurial behavior ; @entity11 was criticized in turn for his inability or unwillingness to tackle corruption in his own government			1
on monday , however , @entity11 wore a wide smile as he greeted his presidential guards upon entering the palace , where he presided over the first peaceful transfer of power in the nation 's history			0
it was made possible by a constitution that he helped draft and that prohibited him from serving a third five - year term			0
@entity1 's first act in office was to swear in @entity15 as chief executive , a role that @entity8 secretary of state @entity171 helped create to give voice to both @entity0 's northern and southern flanks of power			1
outgoing : @entity0 's former president @entity11 arrives for the inauguration of the country 's new president at a ceremony in @entity39 this morning ' @entity0 have taken a moment of challenge and turned it into a moment of real opportunity , ' @entity171 said monday in a statement congratulating both men			1
the deal settled months of political tensions that threatened to push the fragile country into civil war			0
but it remains to be seen how well the two @entity0 leaders will work together , and whether the agreement will last			2
they still must agree on @entity195 appointments			0
the nearly six - month - long election was marred by allegations of massive vote fraud , a staple of @entity0 's last two presidential votes			2
@entity1 won a june runoff with 55 per cent of votes cast , according to official results , though one million votes were thrown out			2
@entity15 's coalition continues to believe the election was stolen but accepted the chief executive compromise to avoid violence			0
bloodshed may be in @entity0 's future anyway			2
@entity6 militants this summer - for the first time since attacks truly picked up in 2005 - fought @entity213 troops instead of the powerful @entity8 and @entity63 military machine			2
the @entity0 army saw its fatality rate skyrocket and the @entity6 make gains			2
@entity1 has said he would also welcome talks with the @entity6 , who control vast rural sections of southern and eastern @entity0			1
' we are tired of war , ' he said in his inauguration speech			0
' our message is peace , ( but ) this does n't mean we are weak			0
' @entity227 did not prevail on monday , according to police reports			0
a suicide bomber detonated explosives at an intersection that leads to @entity39 's airport , killing a half dozen people			2
a bigger attack took place in eastern @entity237 province , where a car bomb and gunfire attack by militants sparked a battle that killed seven @entity6 fighters , four police officers and two civilians			0
the dual attacks served as a reminder that @entity6 violence remains a part of daily life despite the deaths of more than 2,000 @entity8 service members in @entity0 since the 2001 invasion that toppled the @entity6 regime for harboring @entity94 militants responsible for 9/11			1
' i hope @entity1 can bring peace and the rule of law in @entity0 as former @entity0 president @entity11 could not bring peace , ' said @entity259 , a 30 - year - old police officer			1
' our people have been suffering from the instability and poverty			0
' the new president made pledges sure to please not only the international community but many @entity0 as well			2
@entity1 said that women will play a prominent role in government and that corruption will be tackled			2
he introduced his wife to the country , a sharp contrast to @entity11 's wife , who almost never appeared in public			0
@entity1 wore a dark black turban popular in the country 's south as he swore in his two vice presidents and then @entity15 and his deputies			1
@entity15 , a former foreign minister , spoke first and thanked @entity11 for his service and the people of the country for casting votes in the millions despite threats by @entity6 militants			0
' we are committed as one in the national unity government , ' @entity15 said			0
' our commitment will be fulfilled together as a unified team to create national unity			0
' @entity1 then congratulated @entity11 for a peaceful and democratic transition of power , and he thanked @entity15 for making the national unity government possible			0
' we want to be held accountable			0
i am your leader but i am no better than you			0
if i make mistakes , you should hold me accountable , ' @entity1 said			0
though @entity171 played a big role in reaching the deal , he did not attend the inauguration			0
only one world leader was in attendance : @entity306 president @entity305			0
@entity11 , who has cautioned the successor government about its future dealings with the @entity8 , took a bold swipe at the @entity8 during his farewell address last week			0
' they should take a careful path with @entity8 and the @entity101 , ' @entity11 said			0
the @entity8 has invested $ 104billion in @entity0 since 2001 to train and equip the country 's security forces , pave roads , upgrade hospitals , build schools and help modernize the nation , but the @entity8 was omitted from a list of countries @entity11 thanked in his speech			1
the @entity8 ambassador to @entity0 , @entity323 , said @entity11 's remarks were ungrateful and not representative of widespread @entity0 public opinion			1
in his statement , however , @entity171 paid tribute to @entity11 , who inherited a broken country when the @entity8 and their allies chose him more than a decade ago as a leader they hoped could cross ethnic lines , embrace former enemies and bring @entity0 together			1
' it 's no secret that our relationship with president @entity11 has been punctuated by disagreements , ' @entity171 said			0
but ' he is a nationalist , a patriot , and an important figure who stepped forward when his country needed him , and helped profoundly shape one of the most challenging periods in @entity0 history that has seen remarkable progress			2

@entity0 swore in @entity1 as its second elected president
he 's expected to sign an agreement to keep 9,800 @entity8 troops in the country
that number of troops is expected to be cut in half by the end of 2015
