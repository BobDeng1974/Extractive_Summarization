by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 15 june 2013 a woman who failed to reveal she was a convicted thief when she applied to become a police constable is suing @entity4 for discrimination			2
@entity7 ’s bid to become a @entity8 was turned down when background checks revealed she had a criminal record for stealing from a previous employer			1
but she has launched legal action against the force , claiming that she has amnesia that caused her to forget her crime – but no other aspect of her life			1
it is believed that ms @entity7 is the first person with amnesia to have been declared disabled for the purposes of an employment tribunal			1
@entity7 ( left ) in her @entity23 uniform at a community event in @entity25			1
she is suing the @entity26 for disability discrimination astonishingly , her claim has been backed by a renowned psychiatrist – but the @entity30 is ‘ vigorously ’ contesting her case , arguing that her condition is irrelevant as she would not be allowed to become a constable with her criminal record in any case			1
the case , which has been described as ‘ bizarre ’ , has raised fresh concerns about the compensation culture in the police			2
earlier this year @entity40 revealed that pc @entity41 was suing a petrol station owner because she tripped over his kerb while investigating a possible break - in			1
ms @entity7 , who is already employed by the @entity26 as a @entity23 , has had her case dismissed by an employment tribunal			1
but she won the right to a fresh hearing after a senior judge ruled she was indeed disabled when she filled in the application form			2
as a @entity23 – nicknamed ‘ plastic police ’ because of their lack of arrest powers – she can earn up to £ 28,539 a year			2
she previously worked in @entity25 in @entity56 and continues to be employed by the @entity26 as part of a ‘ safer neighbourhoods team ’ in @entity59 , @entity60 , patrolling local streets with regular police officers and attending community events			2
mr @entity64 allowed a new hearing			2
he said that she forgot about her conviction due to traumatic events in her life in august 2008 she applied to become a constable but when her fingerprints were taken as part of the process it emerged that she had a criminal record			1
‘ she had been convicted in 1991 of an offence of theft from a previous employer for which she had been conditionally discharged , ’ according to the judgment of the appeal tribunal published this week			2
it is understood she had been a cashier in a department store in @entity82 , @entity60 , and was arrested with other staff for stealing make - up			1
friends say she protested her innocence at the time but she was convicted and received a conditional discharge , which means the offence went on her criminal record but she received no further punishment			1
ms @entity7 received a disciplinary reprimand for not mentioning the conviction in her initial application to become a @entity23 or during her attempt to become a pc			1
@entity97 , in november 2009 she applied again to become a constable and was knocked back because of her reprimand – but bosses made clear her conviction would have ruled her out anyway			1
although around 1,000 police officers and @entity106 in @entity107 and @entity108 are thought to have criminal records , those found guilty of serious offences such as dishonesty are not allowed to serve in the force			1
a year later ms @entity7 , who is of @entity112 background and thought to be in her early 40s , filed a claim in the @entity115 employment tribunal ‘ complaining of discrimination on the ground of her sex , her sexual orientation , her religion or beliefs , her age and her disability ’ against the @entity26 and several individuals			1
it was claimed that the @entity26 treated her ‘ less favourably ’ because of her condition and failed to take ‘ reasonable steps ’ to accommodate her			2
‘ her case is that when she had originally applied to become a police constable , she had forgotten about her conviction and the facts to which it related as a result of traumatic events in her life , ’ said tribunal judge mr justice @entity64			1
the @entity26 apparently accepts she was suffering from ‘ dissociative amnesia ’ – a form of mental illness that involves gaps in memory – when she filled in the questionnaire			1
but its lawyers say she should have admitted ‘ she did not know whether or not she had any convictions ’			0
at a pre-hearing review in may 2011 , neuropsychiatrist @entity146 said ms @entity7 had been suffering from depression			1
the case has raised new concerns about the compensation culture in the police			0
@entity96 @entity41 sued the force for a prang in her car the expert said her memory loss was likely to be a genuine effect of ‘ traumatic circumstances ’ and that it only affected ‘ her ability to recall events around the time of her arrest and conviction in 1991 ’			0
the @entity40 has attempted to establish what these circumstances were			0
although ms @entity7 , her lawyers and the police declined to explain , sources have suggested she had a baby when young and had a difficult family life			1
she got married in 1991 but later separated from her husband			0
yet the ‘ relatively small gap ’ in her memory did not affect her current job , prof @entity146 said			0
her discrimination claim was initially dismissed by a judge , who ruled she had not been disabled at the time of the job application			0
but last month mr justice @entity64 said : ‘ ms @entity7 ’s appeal must be allowed , the employment judge ’s finding that she was not a disabled person must be set aside , as must his order that her claim of discrimination on the ground of her disability be dismissed			1
the case must be remitted to the employment tribunal			0
’ the fresh hearing will consider if ms @entity7 actually knew she had amnesia when she filled in the form , and if it had a substantial effect on her day - to - day activities			1
a @entity26 spokesman said : ‘ we believe the first hearing outcome was the correct one and will vigorously defend our position at all future hearings			0
we would not wish to discuss our position further prior to proceedings			0
’ the average compensation awarded in employment tribunals in cases of disability discrimination last year was £ 22,183			0
the maximum awarded was £ 390,871 , although there is no upper limit			0
dissociative amnesia is a real condition triggered by traumatic events rather than physical injury , say experts			1
but they stress it is almost always caused by extreme incidents such as repeated childhood sexual abuse			0
sufferers ’ brains forget the events to escape the emotional pain of the memory			2
dr @entity225 explained the condition was considered ‘ dissociative ’ because sufferers ‘ separated off an emotional part of themselves ’ by forgetting a @entity231 condition is included in the psychiatrists ’ ‘ bible ’ , the @entity233 ( @entity233 )			0
but dr @entity225 said the condition was ‘ very rare ’ and was not usually confined to forgetting a single event			0
he said he would want to have an extensive psychiatric report to prove a single episode of amnesia was ‘ part of a wider disorder ’			2
and clinical psychologist dr @entity243 said : ‘ memory loss of such a one - off event does not really fit the typical profile for dissociative amnesia			1
’ @entity248 , a former deputy assistant commissioner at @entity4 , said : ‘ it ’s a complete and utter farce			0
i think it ’s extraordinary			0
‘ people with convictions for dishonesty should not be police officers , full stop			0
we ’ve got enough problems with people not trusting the police as it is			0
’ but he denied the @entity26 had a wider problem with @entity261 claims , saying : ‘ the fact that they did n’t give way and are defending it shows that they are trying to stand up for themselves			0
’ @entity267 mp , chairman of the @entity268 , said : ‘ this is a bizarre case and appears to extend the law beyond what @entity271 has intended			0
the @entity26 is absolutely right to resist this claim			0
it is essential that there is full disclosure at the time of applications to join the police			0
’ dissociative amnesia is a type of memory loss not linked to a physical cause , such as a head injury , but traumatic events , such as being in a car crash or childhood abuse , and some doctors doubt it can be triggered by relatively trivial events .			2
