by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 28 december 2012 @entity1 became seriously ill with a flesh eating bug after contracting a chest infection			1
doctors had to amputate her right leg to save her life for many of us , struggling out in the cold this winter to exercise sounds like a nightmare			1
but for @entity1 , it ’s something she feared might never be possible			1
@entity14 , a mother - of - two from @entity15 , lost her right leg after a chest infection spiralled out of control			1
she became severely ill with a flesh - eating bug and in order to save her life , doctors had to amputate her right leg			1
today , she says she is fitter than she has ever been and also slimmer – and she hopes her story will inspire others in similar situations			2
her problems began after she developed a nasty cough and chest infection			1
‘ i ’ve always been fit and healthy but this chesty cough really knocked me for six , ’ she told @entity28			1
' my gp advised me to take paracetamol and ibuprofen but then two days later i began to experience a cramp - like pain in my right calf			1
it got progressively worse and nothing would ease it			0
’ after another visit to her gp she was provisionally diagnosed with @entity42 ( @entity42 ) and advised to go to hospital			0
what she did n’t know then was that she was actually suffering from necrotising fasciitis , a deadly flesh - eating bug			1
‘ i was told my chest infection was caused by the @entity50 virus and sometimes it can mutate for no apparent reason and start attacking soft and healthy tissue , ’ said @entity14 , 47			1
‘ before the amputation i was a keen runner - half marathon standard – and i ’d done a 10k the week before			1
@entity14 with her husband @entity57 and teenage daughters after her leg was amputated due to the flesh - eating bug that nearly killed her ‘ when i arrived at hospital the pain was getting worse and worse and i just wanted it to stop			1
i had some blood taken and a doctor came to speak to me when i was shown to a bed			0
that was the last thing i remember until 12 days later			0
’ in the days that followed , @entity14 ’s family , including her husband @entity57 and her two teenage daughters , watched in despair as her condition deteriorated			0
the day after her admission , still undiagnosed , she began to go into toxic shock as the toxins began to affect her major organs and her blood pressure dropped to zero			0
she said : ‘ i ’m told that doctors and other medical staff began to frantically try to get lines into my body and things looked very grim			0
i was taken down to theatre immediately and my leg cut open and it was then that the diagnosis was changed from @entity42 to necrotising fasciitis			1
’ the flesh - eating bug had ravaged her right leg and there were worrying patches of black tissue appearing on her fingers and trunk			1
doctors removed the dead tissue from @entity14 ’s legs and placed her in a morphine - induced coma in intensive care			1
she then went into cardiac arrest and her devastated family was told it was unlikely she would survive the night			0
from the very beginning , the seeds of hope were sown that @entity14 would eventually be able to run again			1
she was back in the gym a month after the amputation ‘ when i was brought round 10 days later , my leg was basically just bone between my knee and ankle			1
it was in such a bad way that the doctors told me i needed to make a decision			1
’ one option was to have reconstructive surgery			1
but this would involve numerous operations - with no guarantee they would work – and she would still need a stick to walk			1
the other option was to have an amputation above the knee and be fitted with a prosthetic leg			1
in the end , the decision was made for her			1
while considering her options , she took a turn for the worse and spent four days battling for her life			0
‘ on easter sunday i signed the consent form to have my right leg amputated above the knee			1
it was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made , but even today i think it was the right one			0
being wheeled down to theatre knowing i was going to lose my leg was also very surreal			2
‘ even when i came round , i felt so much better than i had for ages			0
@entity57 , my husband , remarked on how much better i looked already			0
i knew then that i had made the right decision			2
’ from the very beginning , the seeds of hope were sown that @entity14 would eventually be able to run again			2
painstaking : @entity14 had to learn to run again from scratch ‘ basically , my whole life as i knew it ended that day and i knew i would have to re-start my life all over again			1
i set myself small goals along the way , but always with the ultimate aim of being able to run			2
’ her personal trainer before the tragedy , @entity146 , also visited her in hospital			0
‘ she came to see me in hospital and promised i would get fit and again and i would run again , ’ says @entity14			2
' the whole experience has really made me value everything in my life and really appreciate my health ' ‘ and she really did a lot to help me back to fitness - i was back in the gym a month after leaving hospital , when i was still on one leg and crutches			1
’ @entity146 later went on to win the @entity160 award for her remarkable work with @entity14			0
‘ once i was able to walk with a prosthetic leg without the aid of crutches or a walking stick , about nine months post-amputation , i walked the @entity166 and was ready for the big challenge – returning to running			2
’ it was a painstaking journey but with advice from another amputee , she began to make progress			2
' he advised me to start by jumping from my good leg onto the prosthetic foot to gain confidence in my prosthetic leg and i practised this every day			1
i then tried the hop / skip style of running , where you jump twice on the good foot and then land on the prosthetic foot and repeat			0
this got me moving a bit faster			0
@entity14 says she is now fitter and more active than ever			0
she now runs twice a week , cycles and swims as well as working two jobs ' i then felt ready to try step over step running , so accompanied by my husband @entity57 , and a belt round my waist so he could hold me up whilst attempting it , we went to the local athletics track			0
' it was hard work and the first few steps i made were very clumsy and awkward , much like a baby elephant			0
it was exhausting and i realised just how hard this was going to be			0
' she then enlisted the help of running coach @entity204			0
‘ i was very nervous to start with			2
he had to teach me how to run completely from scratch , as i could hardly put one foot in front of the other			2
' it was exhausting - my own leg had to learn how to run alongside a mechanical leg which was quite alien to it , and a lot of the practise was to re-train my brain			1
’ today , six years after losing her leg , @entity14 says she is fitter and more active than ever			2
she now runs twice a week , cycles and swims as well as working two jobs as a supervisor of a pre-school and an admin assistant			0
@entity14 before her accident , when she ran to half marathon standard ‘ i was a keen runner beforehand , so i was pretty fit , but i ’m definitely fitter now – and slimmer			0
i am now quite obsessive about my health and fitness now			0
the whole experience has really made me value everything and appreciate it			0
i ’m also fitter because you use so much more energy exercising with a prosthetic leg			2
‘ i had to learn how to run up and down kerbs , but hills were my biggest fear			1
uphill is hard work - as an amputee , i already use up to 100 per cent more energy to run , but running up hills is like climbing a mountain - and @entity15 has plenty of hills ! ' running on the pavements is a whole new ball game , too			1
the obstacles are many – cracks in the pavement , people , dogs , children , drains , sharp bends and kerbs			0
' running downhill is particularly scary			0
' i 've fallen over a few times running downhill - usually at bus stops , much to the amazement of waiting passengers , but never hurt myself , thankfully			2
' when i took part in my first run with able - bodied people , i ran it in 22 minutes – probably double the time i would have been able to do it in normally			1
it was 1.5 miles , which does n't seem a lot - or it certainly did n’t when i had two legs			2
but that was then and this is now , and it was a challenge for me			0
' i trained hard and even though i had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath , i got my first medal and was proud of my achievement			0
' above all , the important thing is i survived the whole original ordeal and i 'm here today with my family			2
