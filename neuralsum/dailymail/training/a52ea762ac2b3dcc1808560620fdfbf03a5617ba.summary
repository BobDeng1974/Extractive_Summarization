@entity1 's privatised water firms have ‘ abused ’ loopholes in the law to dodge more than £ 1billion in tax since the election			1
a dossier of shame reveals nine water companies , seven of which are foreign owned , have racked up operating profits totalling £ 10billion since 2010 but paid just £ 541million in tax			1
this equates to a tax rate of just 5.3 per cent			0
corporation tax on operating profit is normally 23 per cent			0
down the drain : the @entity18 has missed out on £ 1billion i tax from utility firms , it has been claimed at the same time , two of the country ’s biggest energy firms , also foreign - owned , made combined profits of £ 1.7billion but paid no tax at all			1
meanwhile soaring utility bills have left millions feeling the pinch			0
average water bills have gone up by 14.5 per cent , while electricity bills have soared by 24.8 per cent and gas bills by 33.9 per cent			0
the average family has seen its annual utility bills rise by £ 384			0
the revelations are embarrassing for @entity35 who has pledged to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals			1
the details were revealed to the @entity39 by @entity41 mp @entity40 , a tax lawyer , who called on ministers to force water and power firms to cut their bills if they continued to avoid paying tax			1
there is no suggestion that the firms involved have broken the law , and they all deny wrongdoing			0
but mr @entity40 said the scale of the tax avoidance was staggering			1
‘ foreign - owned utility companies , particularly in the water industry , have been engaging in tax schemes using debt interest to avoid tax , which on my calculation over the last three years indicates that the @entity62 has lost £ 1billion , ’ he said			1
he went on : ‘ they should either be subject to a windfall tax or reduce customers ’ bills			0
’ friendly fire : the revelations to the @entity39 by @entity41 backbench mp @entity40 , left , a lawyer , are embarrassing for @entity35 , right , who has pledged to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals mr @entity40 told mps that the firms were ‘ abusing ’ generous tax reliefs that allow companies to offset debt interest payments against tax			1
he said firms were borrowing huge sums off subsidiaries and sister companies , sometimes in tax havens , and then offsetting the interest payments against tax			2
he singled out @entity85 as an ‘ especially egregious ’ example , saying the giant , which is owned by an international consortium , had generated £ 990million in operating profits over the last three years , yet managed to bank a net tax credit worth £ 46.2million			2
@entity91 , which is also owned by an international consortium , paid net tax of £ 45.9million on profits totalling £ 767million in the last few years			1
foreign - owned @entity95 generated operating profits of £ 1.4billion over the period , but paid tax of just under £ 125million			1
mr @entity40 accused energy firms of exploiting similar practices			2
he said @entity101 , which is owned by the @entity103 government , made £ 268.4million in interest payments to group companies , potentially avoiding £ 70million in tax			2
and @entity108 - owned @entity107 made £ 358million in interest payments , saving a potential £ 93million in tax			2
mr @entity40 called for tax relief to be removed from interest payments to group companies to help curb the abuse			2
feeling the pinch : average water bills have gone up by 14.5 per cent , while electricity bills have soared by 24.8 per cent and gas bills by 33.9 per cent , meaning the average family 's utility costs are up £ 384 the nine water firms examined by mr @entity40 were : the nine firms represent most of the major water companies , although a large number of small firms take the total for @entity125 and @entity126 to 27			1
@entity127 , of @entity128 , said lax @entity1 rules meant avoiding tax was ‘ as easy as taking candy from a baby ’ for multinationals			0
‘ there are several serious problems with the system which leads it wide open to abuse , ’ he said			0
earlier this month it emerged that @entity140 - owned @entity139 paid no tax last year despite racking up pre-tax profits of £ 145million			1
treasury minister @entity143 insisted ministers were making progress in tackling tax avoidance			1

the companies involved insisted they had done nothing wrong			0
@entity152 said they had to borrow large sums in order to fund investment in infrastructure in the @entity1			0
@entity107 said it ‘ has not , and will not , engage in tax avoidance ’ and said its corporation tax bill was low because it made losses in its retail business and ‘ invested billions into the @entity1 ’			1
@entity91 said water companies ‘ invest significant amounts in maintaining and improving infrastructure ’ and this is taken into account when calculating the tax payments			2
an @entity101 spokesman said it pays the corporation tax due each year and makes a significant contribution to the @entity1 economy			0
an @entity95 spokesman said it made a ‘ huge contribution ’ to the economy and pays more than £ 150million a year directly and indirectly in different taxes			0
‘ our corporation tax bill is reduced by specific government incentives and deferred not avoided			0
