@entity0 has slammed @entity2 's decision to stop @entity3 unveiling new forward @entity4 following his £ 75m move from @entity6			1
the @entity7 international was handed a four - month global ban by @entity2 after biting @entity11 defender @entity10 at the @entity12 , and @entity2 have confirmed any public unveiling will not be permitted while the ban remains in force			2
' that he ca n’t even be unveiled is very strange , ' @entity16 told @entity17			2
' there have been worse actions that have gone unpunished			0
his was a sudden action in the heat of the moment			0
@entity4 is due to complete his move from @entity6 in the next few days , and the @entity27 club has previously introduced star signings including @entity43 and @entity44 to packed stadiums			1
there have been suggestions @entity3 could hold a similar event for @entity4 in a non-football venue to get around the four - month ban imposed on the @entity7 striker for biting @entity11 's @entity10 , but @entity2 has confirmed that any such event will not be allowed			1
@entity2 's head of media @entity54 said : ' the ban relates to all football - related activity			2
he can not be in a football - related public event irrespective of the venue			2
' he can not even be involved in a football - related charity event			0
' @entity4 , 27 , had his appeal against the four - month ban , plus a nine - match international and an 100,000 @entity64 franc ( £ 66,000 ) fine , rejected outright by @entity2 's appeals committee			1
he is expected to take his appeal to the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that , as they stand , will keep him out of club football until the end of october			0
name on the shirt : but @entity4 ca n't be shown off to fans at the @entity75 or elsewhere number nine : they might not be able to unveil him but @entity3 fans can already buy @entity4 's shirt different : @entity43 and @entity44 both underwent high profile unveilings at the @entity75 @entity4 can also ask @entity67 to put his ban on hold pending their final decision but that would risk him missing more matches rather than a chunk of the close season if the court upholds the sanctions			1
some 90,000 packed the @entity75 stadium for the unveiling of @entity91 forward @entity43 in june 2013			0
@entity2 's original ban took into account that @entity4 had shown no remorse for the biting incident , his third such attack in less than four years			1
the player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the @entity2 appeals panel			0
@entity4 's lawyer on friday claimed the punishment was ' blatantly draconian , totalitarian and fascist '			1
@entity104 told @entity106 radio station @entity107 : ' the right of a footballer to work is being violated , and football should be worried about that			0
' the nine ( international ) games may seem excessive , but the fact that he ca n't watch a game of football , or train or carry out his job , we are talking about unpleasant things			0
' painful blow : @entity4 's bite on @entity10 led to him getting his four - month ban from football - related activity			1

@entity3 had *planned* to unveil new striker at a non-football venue
the @entity27 club often hold *big* events to reveal new signings
but under his ban @entity4 will not be allowed to be unveiled until his entire four - month ban is served
@entity16 said @entity2 's decision is ' very strange ' , before describing @entity4 as a ' luxury ' for @entity3
@entity4 's lawyer calls the punishment ' draconian , totalitarian and fascist '
