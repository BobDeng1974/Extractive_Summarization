long - term exposure to air particles from traffic pollution can cause clogging of the arteries , known as atherosclerosis , according to a study			2
studying 5,000 participants with an average age of 60 , researchers - who presented their findings at a conference in @entity14 , @entity15 - looked for a link between heart disease and proximity to major roads			1
busy road : long - term exposure to air particles from traffic pollution can cause clogging of the arteries , known as atherosclerosis , according to a study they determined that the closer you lived to heavy - traffic roads , the higher your level of calcium around the heart - potentially causing a condition known as aortic calcification			1
for every 300ft you are closer to major traffic , levels increased by 10 per cent , the study found			1
dr @entity37 , who led the study , said : ‘ these two major types of traffic emissions help explain the observed associations between living close to high traffic and subclinical atherosclerosis			0
‘ the considerable size of the associations underscores the importance of long - term exposure to air pollution and road traffic noise as risk factors for atherosclerosis			0
’ traffic pollution and noise are believed to act through similar bodily pathways , thereby increasing cardiovascular risk , researchers said			1
giving you a headache : traffic pollution and noise are believed to act through similar bodily pathways , thereby increasing cardiovascular risk , researchers said they both cause an imbalance in the nervous system , which regulates blood pressure , blood lipids and glucose level			1
' fine particle matters and traffic noise are believed to act through similar biologic pathways			2
this we think causes cardiovascular disease ' dr @entity37 , @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 dr @entity37 , from @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ‘ fine particle matters and traffic noise are believed to act through similar biologic pathways			2
this we think causes cardiovascular disease			0
‘ they both cause an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system , which feeds into the complex mechanisms regulating blood pressure , blood lipids , glucose level , clotting and viscosity			1
’ the findings were presented at the @entity87 2013 conference			0
previous research also found for every ten decibels of noise from traffic , the risk of a heart attack is increased by 12 per cent			0
a further study by researchers in @entity95 showed that pollutants found in traffic also increased risk of heart attacks .			0

closer you live to heavy - traffic roads , higher calcium level around heart
research finds for every 300ft closer to major traffic , levels rise by 10 *%*
