more than a year after ash dieback was discovered in the @entity3 , not a single product is available to tackle it			1
a firm which has developed a promising treatment claims the government has snubbed it despite independent laboratory tests showing it is effective			0
the airborne fungus – chalara fraxinea – is rife across mainland @entity19 , where in countries such as @entity22 it has already affected 90 per cent of ash trees			1
with the infection confirmed at 501 sites across the @entity3 , the government is focused on identifying trees naturally resistant to the disease , which could then be used to restock affected woodlands			1
but with only a small percentage of trees likely to be impervious , millions will be left to wither and die			0
conservationists and landowners fear this approach will scar the countryside for generations			1
@entity37 , director of @entity38 , says his company has developed a copper - based solution specifically designed to tackle tree disease			2
independent laboratory tests at @entity43 have found it effective against the fungus , as well as a host of other tree pathogens			0
but the firm has been unable to get on to the government - funded shortlist of products for testing against ash dieback			1
despite this , it is determined to get the treatment on to the market and is seeking £ 1.2million in private funding to undertake field trials			0
fourteen potential treatments are being considered by the government but with no deadline for approval , many ash owners are becoming increasingly anxious			2

they may well find the solution that the government does not seem to want to find			0
’ plant physiologist dr @entity98 , who tested the treatment developed by mr @entity37 ’s firm , says ash dieback can be tackled			1
‘ it is a fungus and can be treated with a fungicide , as simple as that			0
' the results for this new treatment are very positive			0
although we have yet to carry out field trials , if i were a gambling man i would have no qualms saying that this product used in the right concentration will give control against ash dieback			1
’ a @entity116 spokesman said : ‘ plant health experts are currently looking at potential treatments , but finding resistance to ash dieback is the best hope for the future of ash in the @entity3			1

ash dieback was discovered in the @entity3 more than a year *ago*
yet there is still no product available to tackle it
conservationists fear the countryside will be scarred for generations
