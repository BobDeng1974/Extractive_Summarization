the @entity0 was criticised yesterday for filling its prime - time schedule with repeats of programmes shown in the past week			1
amid more than six hours of reruns on @entity5 yesterday , shows such as @entity6 , not going out and @entity7 got prime - time billing just days after they first aired			1
and anyone who switched to @entity10 in the hope of finding something fresh would have been equally disappointed			0
it was also filled with reruns , including last sunday ’s final of @entity15			0
the @entity19 special of @entity6 , watched by 9.4million people when it first aired on christmas day , was repeated at 10.20pm yesterday the glut of repeats began on @entity5 at 1.50pm with @entity22 ’s @entity19 , which was first aired on the same channel just 16 hours earlier			1
the afternoon and early evening was filled with films and , after 30 minutes of @entity26 , viewers were once again treated to something from the archives – an episode of @entity30 shown earlier this year			0
a new programme was shown at 9pm – the second instalment of the murder mystery @entity32 – but the rest of the evening was given over to repeats			0
the @entity37 special of bawdy sitcom @entity6 – watched by 9.4million people – was shown again at 10.20pm			2
it was followed by another sitcom , not going out , last seen on @entity41 , and @entity7 , which had been screened on monday			1
almost half the @entity0 ’s @entity19 schedule was taken up by repeats – driven partly by spending cuts at the corporation			1
the number of reruns on @entity5 was up by ten per cent on last year @entity49 mp @entity48 , who chairs the @entity52 culture media and sport committee , criticised the corporation for showing repeats in prime - time slots			2
‘ for many people this is still a holiday period , and lots of families are at home and want to watch something new , ’ he said			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ this @entity19 over 90 per cent of programmes in peak time on @entity5 are brand new and have lead the festive ratings on both days			2
' across the schedule , there are some carefully chosen favourites repeated for audiences to enjoy who missed them first time round			0
