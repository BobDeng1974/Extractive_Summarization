' the blackness pealed away and fell off and new skin grew , ' she said , ' there was thought of amputation but his skin recovered , it was quite scarey			0
' in may 2013 they went to see doctors again to see if he could continue to be treated , but were told by they could n't risk any more surgeries and if something had gone wrong , he would risk amputation			0
' they said come back in 12 months , we will manage the pain			0
' ms @entity27 said she was gobsmacked by their dismissal of his case and felt totally unsatisfied with the outcome , so she decided to do her own research and came across a radiologist in @entity24 she thought might be able to help			1

' i was totally shocked when they told me why			0
they 're saying travelling to @entity24 for the only treatment that could save my son 's foot is " seeking a second opinion , said ms @entity27			1
@entity44 health minister @entity210 ( pictured ) has said on @entity211 on monday he will review @entity6 's case and is confident the government will be able to help ' it means they wo n't allow us into the patient transport access scheme , the only way we 're going to be able to afford to get him to the hospital treatment every three months			1
