@entity0 was the first man @entity0 embraced at the final whistle of @entity4 ’s dramatic @entity3 win over @entity5 on wednesday			1
asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of @entity11 , he replied : ‘ the minute after i found out @entity11 was injured ’			2
the two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night			0
@entity0 is one of those players for whom the old @entity17 song about @entity18 ‘ we all dream of a team of @entity21 ’ would be appropriate			0
he could play in every single position on the pitch			0
@entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity25 ( centre ) and @entity27 after @entity4 's winning goal @entity0 gees up the crowd during another all - action display at the @entity31 for @entity4 it was a fiery @entity5 derby on wednesday night , but @entity0 ( left ) once again proved his worth to @entity4 he often fools around in goal at @entity35 training			1
he started his @entity4 career as a right back and won the @entity38 there for his country			1
he has filled in at left - back , can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker			1
had he been born @entity45 he would probably have grown up as a box - to - box midfielder			0
in @entity35 midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre - back and that is where he has settled			1
on wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no - one down			0
and that ’s the thing about @entity0			0
he very rarely lets anyone down			0
he is @entity4 ’s @entity56 – the all - action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the @entity3 final and heads in a corner that equalises @entity5 ’s 1 - 0 lead in injury time , allowing real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy			1
@entity0 heads away from his own penalty area , but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield the makeshift midfielder holds off @entity5 's @entity70 during a superb display in the middle of the park and when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against @entity75 in 2010 in the @entity3 semi-final when he sent his kick – at least as far as @entity78 was concerned – into outer space , he has the guts to take another one in the @entity38 final a couple of months later , and not only score but dink it @entity85 style over the keeper ’s dive			1
he has been mocked in the past for his @entity90 comments that usually amount to declaring himself ‘ happy with the three points ’ after a cup game or ‘ looking forward to the second leg ’ after a league game , but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him			0
it always seemed that even @entity99 during his fall - out with @entity101 could never really properly fall out with @entity101 ' ally @entity0 because there was too much about him that he admired			2
@entity0 too , while ultimately siding with @entity35 team - mate @entity101 , always saw the worth of a bold and proactive manager			2
the @entity107 centre - back celebrates his crucial , last - minute goal in last year 's @entity3 final @entity0 has shown character to bounce back from his errors , as his penalty for @entity35 in 2012 showed his supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game			1
‘ i like managers to be nice guys but i also like them to have balls ’ he said of @entity0 ’s decision to play him out of his usual position against @entity5			2
‘ we would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out ’ he said after that 1 - 0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with @entity124 who @entity0 had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of @entity5 keeper @entity129 ’s drop kicks			1
@entity4 now have nine games left if they reach the @entity3 final			0
@entity0 will play in all of them no doubt			2
he may even cover for @entity11 again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks ; he will play as an auxiliary striker if @entity4 need a late goal , and he ’ll go in goal if the emergency presents itself			1
someone really should teach @entity4 supporters that song : ‘ we all dream of a team of @entity146 ’			0

@entity0 was superb in midfield during win over @entity5
@entity0 is filling in for injured @entity11 in central role
@entity4 legend is *primarily* a centre - back , but can play elsewhere
@entity35 star started his career up front , and even fools around in goal
