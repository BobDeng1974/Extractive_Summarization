by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 1 may 2013 a mystery white van man filmed battering a cyclist in a vicious road rage attack has been let off without prosecution and only asked to write a letter of apology to his victim			1
@entity9 , who wears a camera on his cycling helmet , was dragged off his bike and hit by the 36 - year - old man close to a @entity15 police station			1
the footage shows the van driver overtaking mr @entity9 before pulling over and hitting him , shouting : ' you f * * * * * * p * * * * , i 'll f * * * * * * knock you out			1
this agreement , introduced by the force three years ago , means the aggressor will pay the cyclist compensation and offer a written apology			1
the shocking footage has gone viral since former olympic cycling champion @entity26 saw it and shared it with his 80,000 followers on @entity47			1
he retweeted : ' get @entity49 cycling : ? there 's a lot to do when @ wmpolice think it 's okay not to charge / warn 4 this			0
' footage : after an altercation on the road , the attacker got out of his van and gave chase floored : the cyclist was then dragged to the ground during an attack where the blows are heard clearly clambering : to avoid further punches @entity9 scrambles to his feet on the @entity15 pavement mr @entity9 and scores of other cyclists have reacted with anger that police failed to act , who stated they were powerless due to @entity72 guidelines			1
@entity30 responded on @entity47 to mr @entity26 saying : ' cyclist accepts under @entity72 guidance that officers ' hands were tied and were unable to take him to court			1
' writing on @entity79 , mr @entity9 said : ' this was obviously totally unprovoked - the internet has named and shamed him			1
this is all very overwhelming and i 'm a little bit frightened			0
' referring to himself as ' @entity86 ' on @entity47 , he added : ' this was a violent , unprovoked attack that has no place in society and i 'm very disappointed and angry that the driver will not face criminal consequences			2
' the driver was brought in for interview and initially claimed provocation , that i kicked his van and kicked him in the chest			2
' as the victim i was given the choice of the driver receiving a caution or i could accept a local resolution , the terms of which that i would receive an amount in compensation and a written apology			1
i 'm far from happy about it but reluctantly accepted the resolution			0
' i do n't think the police are to blame but the decisions made by @entity112 departments that govern them			0
' abuse : after the initial attack the white van man , 36 , then swore and threatened more violence withdrawal : with a bus stopped next to his vehicle the attacker then tells the cyclist to call the police if he likes he was riding along @entity124 in the affluent @entity126 suburb of the city on march 16 when the incident happened			0
an eyewitness said : ' it was a very brutal and unprovoked attack so i am very surprised to hear the guy has got away with it			0
the driver went mad and kept punching the cyclist			2
he was very angry - a case of small man syndrome if you ask me			0
' as a cyclist myself , it is unnerving to know that people can get away with this sort of violent behaviour			0
' mr @entity9 calls himself ' @entity144 ' on @entity47 and @entity145 and has uploaded more than 100 videos from his travels around @entity15 , some of which result in verbal confrontations with drivers			1
the footage has now been removed from @entity145 , due to its policy on ' shocking and disgusting content			0
' @entity155 : @entity30 's @entity156 , within sight of where the attack happened the van is operated by a pet business based in @entity126 called weird and wonderful , which has deleted its @entity79 and @entity47 accounts as a result of the complaints it was receiving from cyclists			1
the company has also disabled the online feedback form on its website			0
meanwhile , the wife of the driver , says she has been forced to call in police after receiving hundreds of email and phone threats after the footage of the attack went viral on the internet showing her business van			2
the woman , who does not want to be identified , said there was ' no excuse ' for her husband 's behaviour and added that he did not work at the business			0
a spokeswoman for @entity30 said they were aware of the alleged threats			2
