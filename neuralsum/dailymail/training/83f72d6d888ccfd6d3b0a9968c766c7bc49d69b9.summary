@entity1 champions @entity0 have become the mirror image of @entity3 as a well - organised and hard - working team with a fierce commitment and a strong rebellious streak			1

@entity3 is constantly looking ahead during matches , second - guessing the opposition and ready to switch tactics			0
@entity0 's team includes many players who had never experienced success until the arrival of the man said to play with a knife between his teeth , who instilled his winning mentality and a ' match by match ' philosophy			2
@entity3 's success at the helm of @entity0 has meant he is a favourite with the club 's supporters @entity0 lost striker @entity49 ( left ) and defender @entity73 to @entity52 in the summer he took over at the end of 2011 with the team struggling and made an immediate impact as they finished in fifth place before beating @entity78 to win the @entity79			1
