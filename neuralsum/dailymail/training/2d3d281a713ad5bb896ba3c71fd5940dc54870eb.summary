by @entity0 since setting up his interior design business in 1971 , @entity1 has worked on some of @entity4 ’s most iconic institutions , including the @entity5 and @entity7 ’s @entity6			2
as well as being involved in such prestigious projects , @entity9 , a past president of the @entity10 , also made his own furniture			2
in 1979 , needing a studio to produce his pieces , he bought a former @entity15 dairy in @entity16 , a stone ’s - throw from @entity18 and the fashionable @entity20 market , for £ 90,000 and set up his own workshop			1
@entity22 and his wife @entity23 are selling not one , but two , flats in the old dairy in @entity16 it proved to be an astute buy			1
in 1995 , @entity9 no longer needed the workspace ( partly because most of his one - off pieces were being copied ) , so he sold a portion of the land for development and then spent £ 2million converting the dairy into seven live / work units and a maisonette			1
he gave three properties to his children – and today his son @entity39 is selling a three - bedroom , two - storey apartment , which comes complete with a roof terrace , and a one - bedroom flat for a total of £ 3.5million			1
the cul - de - sac in which the apartments are set contains a mixture of @entity48 terrace houses and businesses – the old post office sorting office has since been converted into offices and studios , and an undertaker ’s remains where it has been since 1937			1
the three - bedroom apartment is , naturally , beautifully designed , although elegantly simple and retains its industrial character			1
@entity39 , a director of a property business that manages the £ 4.5billion @entity59 in @entity60 , bought the top floor , which had been a studio , from his sister @entity63 , and set about amalgamating it with the flat below			1
family flats : @entity39 's father , designer @entity1 , bought the @entity68 dairy in 1979 and converted it into flats and studios in 1995 ‘ because we owned the building we did n’t have to do all the work at once , ’ says @entity39 – the couple finished the top - floor kitchen and sitting room only two years ago			1
but their hard work was worth the wait , and the result is a stunning loft - like space with a vaulted ceiling and a vast skylight that floods the room with light			1
‘ we never put the lights on , ’ says @entity39 ’s wife @entity23 , 35 , who runs a fashion business , @entity89 , which showcases the couture of stallholders at @entity20 and @entity60 markets			0
the open - plan room also gives a view of the campanile at nearby @entity97			1
‘ when my father bought the dairy it was n’t listed , so he could have flattened it , but because he has a great interest in architecture he treated it like a listed building , ’ says @entity39			1
‘ this part was the offices and all he did was gentrify it			0
’ but not by much			0
the beauty of the apartment is that it has space , light and an impressive utility			0
the walls are hung with modern art – a @entity115 , a @entity116 and an intriguing work by @entity118 , who followed @entity119 spooks for a year , painting their interviews with contacts for a project to mark the 50th anniversary of @entity124			0
a huge marble worktop in the kitchen reflects the building ’s heritage			0
‘ in a dairy they would have used marble not because it ’s easy to clean but because it ’s cool , ’ says @entity39			2
mr @entity1 is selling a three - bedroom , two - storey apartment , which comes complete with a roof terrace , and a one - bedroom flat for a total of £ 3.5million the @entity136 in the kitchen in the three - bedroom flat in the old diary , located in @entity16 , @entity60 @entity140 beside the staircase is exposed , and the electric wiring is covered by aluminium scavenged from a decommissioned ship in @entity145 , while the huge pendant lights from the high ceiling in the hall came from a @entity150 car factory			1
light and space are the key to this building – even the cloakroom has a view ( out but not in ) and the cupboards are designed to provide storage , but not at the expense of masking light or interrupting the flat ’s flow			0
the kitchen / reception is 32ft long and even the couple ’s dressing room is the size of most double bedrooms			0
‘ we could have crammed in another bedroom but , for me , circulation space is so important , ’ says @entity39 , who points out that , with the flat below their apartment being part of the sale , the two could be knocked together into a house			2
alternatively , the smaller flat could be kept as an investment opportunity			0
so why sell ? ‘ we ’re a young family and we want more children			0
the roof terrace is great but it ’s not a garden , ’ says @entity23			0
although @entity39 admits that he ’s not artistic , he made one key decision that has had a great impact on the property ’s value			0
‘ when @entity189 developed the dairy , he did live / work units , but the problem is that it ’s not great for residential values , so we changed its status to residential			2
‘ not only is it very hard to get a mortgage on part - commercial and residential property , but you also have to pay business rates , which are expensive , ’ he says			2
