by @entity1 medical correspondent thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer could be denied a new drug by the @entity6 rationing body			1
@entity7 extends life by nearly four months and improves quality of life for men whose cancer has spread to the bones			1
in the latest blow to men with prostate cancer , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) has issued a draft decision not to recommend its use on the @entity6 in @entity19 and @entity20			2
the drug @entity7 or @entity7 extends life by up to four months			1
a full course of the drug costs £ 24,000 but @entity24 has agreed an @entity6 discount @entity16 says @entity24 , the manufacturer of @entity7 , has not supplied data comparing it with another drug regime so can not judge whether it is cost - effective			1
but charities and cancer specialists are outraged , saying it could take years for this ‘ innovative ’ agent to be tested against other new drugs and it is a ‘ kick in the teeth ’ for men who have run out of options			0
around 10,500 @entity39 men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments			2
@entity16 is also considering curbs on enzalutamide , which extends life by five months , with some men living for 18 months			1
@entity7 is an internal radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and is not responding to hormone therapy			2
sir @entity50 , @entity16 's chief executive said the organisation needed to be confident that the benefits would justify the cost the monthly injection has been shown to extend survival by an average of 3.6 months and delays the cancer getting into the bones by 5.5 months			2
because radium - 223 is similar to calcium , it is taken up by active bone cells and is therefore an effective way of zapping bone cancer cells and raising quality of life with minimal side effects			2
a course of treatment costs £ 24,000 , although @entity24 has agreed an @entity6 discount with the @entity72 , which is confidential			0
in the @entity74 , the drug also known as @entity7 was fast - tracked for approval last year because no alternative therapy was available			0
but @entity16 says it was not possible to determine whether it could be considered a cost - effective use of @entity6 resources , because comparison data with the cancer drugs docetaxel and abiraterone had not been presented by @entity24			1
leading prostate cancer specialist professor @entity82 said @entity16 was imposing virtually impossible conditions on the drug ’s use despite accepting that it works			1
he said ‘ doing trials to produce this data could bring delays of four , five or more years when some men could be benefiting right now			0
‘ the @entity91 in the @entity74 is an enlightened organisation that reached a rapid opinion which recognised the need for men to have access to this drug if the cancer had gone to their bones			0
‘ we need to cut back the power of @entity16 , this has been promised but nothing seems to happen			1
‘ if this was a drug to treat breast cancer there would be an outcry ’ he added			0
@entity106 , director of policy and strategy at @entity109 @entity39 said ‘ it ’ s a terrible kick in the teeth for men facing their last months , especially as other new treatments , such as enzalutamide , have restrictions on use in @entity19 and @entity20			1
‘ unless the drug company provides the necessary evidence , men will be denied this safe and effective drug			0
‘ we urge @entity24 to submit everything required in the coming weeks before @entity16 takes its final decision on this valuable treatment			0
leading prostate cancer specialist professor @entity82 said @entity16 was imposing virtually impossible conditions on the drug 's use despite accepting that it works ‘ men dying of prostate cancer have so few options and to lose one that has already been developed and is known to be effective is madness			1
’ sir @entity50 , @entity16 chief executive , said ‘ bone metastases are very distressing for patients and their families , particularly as a result of bone pain and fatigue , which have a profound effect on patients ’ quality of life , by limiting their mobility and meaning full - time care would often be needed for daily activities			0
‘ we know how important this could be to patients and we are disappointed not to able to recommend this drug , but we have to be confident that its benefits justify its considerable cost			0
’ a @entity24 spokesman said @entity7 was the first drug of its type developed to treat advanced prostate cancer			1
he said it was trying ‘ to develop a new economic model using a measure of progression appropriate to the innovative nature of @entity7 ’ and would continue to work with @entity16			0
the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) has yet to consider the drug for use in @entity167			0

@entity16 said it is not able to judge whether drug is cost - effective
