@entity1 loanee @entity0 looks set to miss the start of the season after suffering a hamstring injury on his debut in @entity6			1
the @entity8 defender only joined the @entity1 on a season - long deal on thursday but was forced off after 60 minutes of the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity0 's injury is the latest blow for boss @entity15 who has already lost striker @entity16 until december following ankle surgery and is without right back @entity19 who has a hamstring problem			1
and midfielder @entity31 admits the squad are already looking to @entity33 to answer their problems in the final third			2
' we need him ( @entity33 ) at the minute , ' said @entity31 before the squad returned to @entity38 last night having failed to score a goal at the @entity40			0
' we need another striker and we 're light on players			0
new side : @entity0 lasted just 60 minutes for @entity1 in a friendly match against @entity11 ' @entity45 has gone down with a slight hamstring and @entity19 is n't here and big @entity48 ( @entity16 ) is injured			1
' i do n't even think ( the manager ) knows his starting xi at the minute what with players coming in , players being injured and players not being quite fit yet			0
' hopefully we can get another couple of signings in , good players who are going to improve the squad			0
' @entity61 is one possibility for @entity15 while @entity64 's @entity63 could emerge as a target should he not be offered a new contract at the @entity67 .			2
