a recent @entity1 survey showed that @entity2 may live up to their poor reputation while travelling abroad			1
but what ’s more surprising is that many of those surveyed self - identified themselves as ‘ ugly ’ @entity2 and the world ’s worst travellers			1
the results show that @entity2 , as well as @entity10 and @entity11 all named @entity2 travellers as the world 's worst tourists			1
self - hating : in a @entity1 survey , 20 per cent of @entity2 said they found @entity2 tourists to be the worst of the bunch those in the @entity2 ranked themselves as the worst travellers by a shocking 20 per cent , followed by 15 per cent saying the @entity21 were the most substandard tourists			1
in the survey , more than 5,600 people in five countries were polled by @entity26 however , hatred for the stereotypical fanny pack - toting @entity2 was n’t universal in the study			1
the @entity30 ranked the @entity31 as the worst travellers , and similarly , the @entity31 thought very poorly of @entity33 tourists			1
@entity2 travellers are stereotyped in a number of ways , but the most common are that they wear unflattering , casual clothing ( such as cargo pants , sweatshirts , white trainers , and baseball caps ) and talk too loudly			0
some think that speaking loudly equates speaking clearly , the stereotype goes , and more cruelly , @entity2 tourists are thought to be quite stout			2
in addition , four out of ten @entity2 respondents said that they ‘ accidentally ’ packed or intentionally stole items from hotels , with towels being the most popular items to snatch			2
in a more positive light , the study showed another @entity2 misconception was not true – @entity2 , for the most part , are surprisingly well - travelled			2
the study showed that 78 per cent of @entity2 have visited at least one foreign country ( though there was no word on if it was @entity10 or @entity58 ) , and 61 per cent have visited more than one country			0
the average @entity2 respondent said they visited more than four countries			0
according to the findings , @entity2 also enjoyed fewer vacation days than their @entity66 counterparts , with only 16 days off versus 27 days ( @entity11 ) , 21 days ( @entity10 ) , 28 days ( @entity30 ) and 23 days ( @entity31 )			0
out of their 16 days off , an average of four days was spent abroad , the report said			0
perhaps more depressing still was the fact that 66 per cent of @entity2 said they checked their email whilst on vacation .			0

@entity1 survey showed that 20 **%** of @entity2 polled said they were the worst tourists
@entity2 ranked @entity21 second worst at 15 **%**
@entity2 *residents* also *readily* *admitted* to stealing from hotels
