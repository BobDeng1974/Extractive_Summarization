the 25 - year - old actress , who arrived back just in the nick of time from @entity10 last night , turned up wearing a gaping white cardigan top , which exposed her cleavage , teamed with champagne - coloured trousers and heels			0
but it appeared the starlet may have over indulged on her mini-break as she was looking a little bloated and sporting a double chin - something the cameras did n't happen to catch during her recent nude @entity21 photoshoot			0
while her court dates usually see her admonished - today golden girl @entity2 was given the thumbs up for completing her probation requirements early over the past month			1
judge @entity25 - apparently feeling the festive spirit - told @entity2 she was pleased with her progress and told her to keep it up			0
fuller - faced : @entity2 arrived at court in @entity4 this morning for a probation hearing , but looked somewhat bloated and was sporting a double chin racy appearance : @entity2 was wearing a gaping cardigan top , which exposed her cleavage , and champagne - coloured trousers with heels ' you are doing well and i 'd like to see it continue , ' the @entity38 judge told her			1
' the morgue seems to be pleased - as pleased as a morgue can be , ' she added			0
judge @entity25 also chirped : ' i think she likes coming here and seeing me , ' in a comment to @entity2 's lawyer @entity47 , who asked if @entity2 needed to return to court next month if she completes her next stint of probation requirements early			1
@entity2 will indeed have to show her face again because , as the judge put it : ' she wo n't complete her probation otherwise , ' prompting @entity2 to chuckle			2
the actress - who features nude in the upcoming issue of @entity21 - has been ordered to complete another 12 days of community service and four therapy sessions ahead of her next court date on january 17			1
judge @entity25 told @entity2 that he recent trip to @entity10 was perfectly acceptable because it was to celebrate her sister @entity62 's birthday , who turns 18 later this month			2
thumbs up : the smiling actress , pictured with lawyer @entity47 , was praised by the judge for keeping up with her probation requirements @entity2 has progressed ahead of schedule with her community service and was told that she can now travel for pleasure whenever she has completed her 12 days of service she is slated to do per month			1
otherwise @entity2 is only allowed to travel to see her family on holidays and special occasions with the approval of her probation officer			2
' in any month you complete your twelve days early you can travel for pleasure , to see her family to not see her family - to go to a spa or whatever			2
' the holidays are coming up so you can travel to see your family			0
' but travel for pleasure or fun is only allowed after you 've completed the 12 days			1
' @entity2 was ordered last month to spend 30 days in jail after she admitted violating her probation in a @entity87 case and another involving the theft of a necklace from a @entity91 jewellery store			2
due largely to jail overcrowding , she served only about five hours at the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95			0
relief : while @entity2 is usually admonished at her court appearances , today was a different matter and the actress could hardly contain her happiness as the @entity101 told her to keep up the good work light moment : @entity2 covers her face after letting out a laugh when the judge joked that @entity2 will have to return to court next week because otherwise ' she wo n't complete her probation '			1
@entity25 added that @entity2 likes coming to see her in court @entity2 admitted she had violated probation by failing to show up for community - service appointments and therapy sessions			1
judge @entity25 technically sentenced the actress to 300 days behind bars but only required her to serve 30 days			0
the remaining 270 days of the sentence will be stayed as long as @entity2 adheres to a specific schedule of community service work and therapy sessions , @entity25 ruled			1
included in that schedule was a requirement for her to perform 12 days of community service at the @entity123 morgue and attend four psychotherapy sessions prior to today 's hearing			1
she will now have until jan 17 to serve another 12 days at the morgue and attend four more therapy sessions			2
if she remains on track , @entity2 will then have until february 15 to complete another 12 days at the morgue and four more therapy sessions			1
after that , she will have until march 29 to perform 17 more days at the morgue and six more therapy sessions			0
if @entity2 sticks to the schedule , her probation in the 2007 @entity87 case will terminate at the end of march , and her probation in the @entity91 theft case will be downgraded to summary , non-supervised probation , @entity25 said			0
@entity2 pleaded no contest may 11 to a misdemeanour grand theft charge involving a necklace priced at $ 2,500 pilfered from a @entity91 jewellery store			0
@entity145 : the @entity147 star teamed her look with an animal print handbag time for the crime : the probation stems from a 2007 drink - driving conviction and a jewellery theft conviction earlier this year she was placed on three years probation and ordered to spend 120 days in jail and complete the 480 hours of community service to which she had been previously sentenced for violating her probation in a 2007 misdemeanour @entity87 case			1
@entity2 was ordered to have her 480 hours of community service completed by april 2012 , with 360 hours at the @entity164 and another 120 hours at the county morgue			1
however , her attendance was so sporadic at the @entity168 center that shelter officials terminated her from the community - service program there			0
that prompted @entity25 to revoke the actress ' probation			0
she later ordered that @entity2 perform all of her community service work at the morgue			1
jetting back : @entity2 arriving back to @entity4 last night following mini break in @entity10 since her last court hearing , the @entity179 star posed for a much - publicized photo spread in @entity21			2
pictures from the photo shoot leaked online , prompting the magazine to move up the release date of the @entity2 issue			0
@entity2 made news earlier this week when her purse was stolen while she was vacationing in @entity10 - a trip that was previously approved by her probation officer			0
@entity2 's purse was recovered , but an estimated $ 10,000 she was carrying in it was missing			0
