by @entity1 reporter published : 12:44 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 12:46 est , 26 october 2012 a @entity3 programmer who sued @entity4 claiming 50 per cent of its ownership has been arrested in what 's now being called a multibillion - dollar scheme			2
@entity9 , 39 , was arrested on friday at his @entity10 , @entity3 home after federal prosecutors say he fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against @entity4 and its ceo @entity14			1
@entity17 @entity16 attorney @entity15 said @entity9 was seeking a ' quick payday based on a blatant forgery			2
' busted : @entity9 , who sued @entity4 ceo @entity14 for half of his company , has been arrested on charges he forged records claiming his promised ownership he was scheduled to appear in federal court in @entity26 on friday afternoon			1
prosecutors say @entity14 agreed in 2003 to perform programming work for @entity9 and his fax business when he was a @entity30 student			1
in @entity9 's lawsuit filed against @entity14 in early 2011 , he claimed @entity14 promised him at least half of his future website in what would become @entity4 as seen today			1
@entity9 presented a two - page contract and emails allegedly between both men which authorities say have been found falsified with the help of forensic examination in @entity9 ’s hard drives and @entity30 ’s email servers			1
@entity44 deal : @entity9 claimed that @entity14 had signed over half of his future company to him in 2003 while at @entity30 but the purported emails have been found fake by authorities they say @entity9 falsified the first page of the contract and then attached a second that held both men 's signatures , appearing to agree to the deal			1
with their signatures dated april 20 of 2003 , however , authorities pointed out it predating @entity14 's claims of having come up with the idea for the social media site in the first place			1
' the contract is a cut - and - paste job , the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud , ' attorneys for mr @entity14 and his @entity70 , @entity71 - based company wrote at the time of @entity9 's lawsuit			1
' @entity14 has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to @entity9 's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails , ' they said			1
it was not immediately clear who will represent @entity9 in court			2
november 22 , 2003 - mr @entity14 to mr @entity9 ' i have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at @entity30 that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours			1
if we do n’t make a move soon , i think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them			0
' i ’ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $ 1000 for the facebook ( sic ) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or @entity99 to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them			0
please give me a call so that we can talk more about this			0
' january 1 , 2004 - mr @entity14 to mr @entity9 i think it is unnecessary at this point , with all of the extra work i have done for you , to be held to the original completion date			1
i should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control , namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the @entity115 project that you wanted to be placed as a priority , thereby delaying my start on our second project			0
' thus , i am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract			0
' january 5 - mr @entity9 to mr @entity14 ' it is well past january 1 and to my knowledge you do n't have a single thing done for the site ... you know perfectly well that you ca n't just take a person 's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in @entity30			1
' i 've been stalled long enough on this thing and if i do n't see something soon i 'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in @entity144 and let them know what 's going on			2
' february 2 , 2004 - mr @entity14 to mr @entity9 ' @entity9 , i have a rather serious issue to discuss with you , according to our contract i owe you over 30 % more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80 % of the company			1
' first i want to say that i think that is completely unfair because i did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second i do n’t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty			0
' mostly though i just wo n’t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage			0
i ’d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership			0
' february 6 , 2004 - mr @entity14 to mr @entity9 ' sorry it ’s taken me a few days to respond , ( sic ) now that the sites ( sic ) live i feel i must take creative control and i just can not risk injuring my sites ( sic ) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk , nor do i wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni			1
the site is cool as it is and i do n’t care about making any money on it right now , i just want to see if people will use it			0
' february 7 , 2004 - mr @entity9 to mr @entity14 ' @entity14 , all i can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and money that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh i ’ve changed my mind i do n’t think it ’s cool to make money and that that should be that			2
' april 6 , 2004 - mr @entity14 to mr @entity199 , i have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it , so i am thinking of just taking the server down			2
my parents have a fund that i can tap into for my college expenses and i would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work			0
at this point i wo n’t even really be able to work on the facebook until @entity213			0
' april 6 , 2004 - mr @entity9 to mr @entity14 ' grow up , take a f * * * ing ethics class , choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours			2
' july 22 , 2004 - mr @entity14 to mr @entity9 ( a week before the company was incorporated ) ' @entity9 , i am guessing that you do n’t want to talk to me but i wanted to say happy birthday and that i hope to resolve our differences			2
i see that what i did was wrong and i am really sorry that i behaved as i did			0
please give me your address and i will mail you back the $ 2000 for your trouble , more if it will repair our business relationship			0
' another summer is here and i still do n’t have any time to build our site , i understand that i promised i would , but other things have come up and i am out in @entity71 working during break			0
i just do n’t want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and i wo n’t be able to			0

@entity9 , 39 , claimed @entity14 promised him at least half of his website before its *development* in 2003
