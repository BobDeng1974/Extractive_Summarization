five seconds in @entity0 changed the course of @entity3 history , and the men haunted most by the memories of that day are the ones who could have had a hand in preventing the tragedy			0
the assassination of @entity11 more than 50 years ago has become a subject of intense scrutiny , with countless books and more than a dozen films devoted to investigating the shooting and its related conspiracy theories			0
but agents ' testimony and the findings of the @entity22 point to simple steps that might have averted @entity11 's death , namely having the @entity26 agents better prepared for protecting @entity11 instead of staying out late and drinking the night before			1
veteran @entity43 broadcaster @entity42 was just a beat reporter for the @entity44 in 1963 , but he recalled on the night before the assassination being in the company of several @entity26 agents into the early hours			2
nine agents had wandered over to the @entity49 from the @entity50 around midnight , searching for a bite to eat after a long day working the escort detail for the president 's trip to @entity50			1
finding the food already gone , agents made do with some scotch and sodas and a couple cans of beer before seven of the agents followed journalists to the @entity63 , a late - night hangout in town			1
' @entity63 was an all - night @entity71 – style coffee house down the street and some of the visiting reporters had heard about it and wanted to see it , ' @entity42 explains			1
' so we all went over there and some of the agents came along			2
the place did n’t have a liquor license , but they did serve liquor to friends — usually grain alcohol and @entity81			1
' reflexes : agent @entity83 reacted to the first shot by racing up to the president 's car , but reportedly struggled to get a hold on the back and scrambled to reach @entity89 and the fatally wounded president as the night turned into early morning , several agents remained at what @entity94 chief justice @entity93 , who headed the @entity22 investigating the assassination , termed a ' beatnik joint			1
' four of the agents admitting to be out until around 3 a.m. would be in the motorcade the next morning as the fatal shots struck president @entity11			2
after the assassination , @entity93 tore into @entity102 , the agents ' supervisor at the @entity26 for not punishing agents for drinking , which was a punishable offense in the service			1
entourage : @entity11 and his wife were joined by @entity50 governor @entity109 and his wife @entity110 , as well as two senior agents whose advanced age and failure to react quickly was questioned after the assassination ' do n’t you think that if a man went to bed reasonably early , and had n’t been drinking the night before , ' @entity93 fumed , according to author @entity118 , ' he would be more alert than if he stayed up until three or five o’clock in the morning going to beatnik joints and doing some drinking along the way ? ' whether the agents had even gotten intoxicated has been a matter of debate			1
' if they did have something to drink i never saw it , ' @entity126 said			0
' they may well have had			0
' @entity63 's owner , @entity131 , wrote letters shortly after @entity11 's assassination asserting that the agents did not drink that night , but in 1984 , he told the @entity44 that in spite of being a ' dry ' club , the @entity63 plied important people like policemen and politicians with significant portions of liquor			1
investigation : the @entity22 , appointed by newly sworn - in president @entity143 , took issue with the readiness of agents after @entity11 's assassination commish : @entity94 chief justice @entity93 ( fifth from left ) hands the report from the @entity22 over to president @entity143 ' about 3:30 , these @entity26 men were sitting around giggling about how the firemen were guarding the president over at the @entity50 , ' @entity131 stated			1
' after the agents were there we got a call from the @entity158 , ' the @entity63 's manager @entity153 said , ' asking us not to say anything about them drinking because their image had suffered enough as it was			1
we did n’t say anything but those guys were bombed			0
they were drinking pure @entity165 , ' grain alcohol sold at 151 and 190 proof			1
the next morning the security detail working in the president 's motorcade would include several agents who had stayed out past two according to their testimony to the @entity22			1
@entity11 reportedly disliked having agents in the crowd 's line of sight or blocking him from greeting well - wishers along parade routes , so that day the president rode in a limousine with his wife , @entity50 governor @entity109 and his wife @entity110			2
behind @entity11 was a follow car where agent @entity183 was seated			0
on footboards attached to the car stood agent @entity83 on one side with agents @entity187 and @entity189 on the other			2
all four had stayed up until around 3 a.m. , with @entity189 admitting he stayed out until 5 a.m. justice @entity93 noted that some attendees noted seeing the barrel of a gun sticking out of the @entity194 and questioned why the service members did n't see it			1
' would n’t a @entity26 man in this motorcade , who is supposed to observe such things , be more likely to observe something of that kind if he was free from any of the results of liquor or lack of sleep than he would have otherwise ? ' video from @entity210 , then a 58 - year - old dress manufacturer shooting on a @entity208 film camera , shows the first shot strike @entity11 , who draws his fists up to his face in pain			0
' i knew right away it was a gunshot , ' says @entity189 today			0
but the agents were slow to react			0
at the wheel of @entity11 's car was 54 - year - old agent @entity221 , whose advanced age was also questioned after the assassination , and instead of accelerating or swerving he pressed the brakes , according to witnesses			1
of the agents in the follow car , only @entity83 raced towards the president			0
by the time he reached the car in front of him , another shot , this one fatal , had struck @entity11 in the side of the head			0
@entity32 compares the actions to what happened three cars behind @entity11 , where agent @entity237 sat with vice president @entity143			0
at the sound of the first shot , @entity237 , who had not been at the @entity242 or the @entity63 , followed his service training and pushed @entity143 to the floor and covered him with his body			2
though it is difficult to say 50 years out what , if anything , could have saved @entity11 , in the few seconds between the first shot that hit @entity11 and the next , there may have been a window where his life could have been saved			0
for @entity83 , one of the agents who had been out the night before , those seconds have weighed heavily for years			2
' it was my fault , ' he told @entity257 in 1975			0
' if i had reacted just a little bit quicker			0
. i ’ll live with that to my grave			0

the @entity22 took issue with the conduct of several agents who had been out late the night before and were *accused* of drinking
one agent admitted to being out until 5 a.m
according to @entity93 , chief justice of the @entity94 , agents *overlooked* the barrel of a gun that witnesses claimed they saw in the @entity274 and reacted slowly to the gunshots
the owner of the @entity63 , a late - night hangout in @entity49 , later admitted to seeing agents ' giggling ' in the bar at 3:30 a.m.
the manager claimed the agents were getting ' bombed ' on grain alcohol
