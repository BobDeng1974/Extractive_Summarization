by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has equalled @entity4 's goalscoring record at the @entity5			1
the @entity7 forward came off the bench against @entity9 to score his first goal of the tournament , which put him joint level on 15 in finals history with the @entity15 legend			0
@entity2 came on with his side at 2 - 1 down , but grabbed one from close range within two minutes to level the scores			0
leveller : @entity2 is now the joint top scorer in @entity5 history with 15 finisher : the @entity7 forward scored his 15th goal in finals in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity9 congratulation : felicitations from @entity4 2002 : 3 vs @entity29 , 1 vs @entity30 , 1 vs @entity32 tournament total : 5 2006 : 2 vs @entity35 , 2 vs @entity36 , 1 vs @entity37 tournament total : 5 2010 : 1 vs @entity38 , 1 vs @entity39 , 2 vs @entity37 tournament total : 4 2014 : 1 vs @entity9 tournament total : 1 ( so far ) @entity5 total : 15 and he was congratulated by @entity4 himself , who took to twitter to personally show his appreciation of his new equal			1
@entity2 's first @entity5 appearance came in 2002 , where he scored a hat trick in an 8 - 0 victory over @entity29			1
he netted again in their next group game , a 1 - 1 draw with @entity30 , before scoring the second in a 2 - 0 victory over @entity32			0
despite @entity53 's run to the final that year , @entity2 failed to find the net again in the tournament , eventually finishing level on goals with @entity59 , and behind top scorer @entity4 who grabbed eight			2
during his home @entity5 four years later in 2006 , the forward found the net five times again , which was enough for the @entity64			0
@entity65 : @entity2 peels away after scoring against @entity32 during the 2002 @entity5 @entity67 : the forward leaping to head the equaliser against @entity37 in the 2006 quarter - final slipped in : @entity2 scoring the opener of a 4 - 1 victory against @entity39 in the last - 16 in 2010 he scored two goals in their opening 4 - 2 victory over @entity35 , and twice more in their final group game against @entity36			1
@entity2 's final goal in that @entity5 was his vital 80th - minute equaliser against @entity37 in the quarter - finals , that brought the score to 1 - 1 , with @entity53 eventually winning on penalties			2
and in 2010 , he managed four more strikes : one in their opening 4 - 0 win over @entity38 , once in their 4 - 1 demolition of @entity39 in the last - 16 and twice in their 4 - 0 destruction of @entity37 in the quarter - finals			0
chances are that , at 36 , this @entity5 will be his last , so he has a possibly maximum of five games to grab that vital goal that will bring him the all - time record .			2

@entity2 equalises @entity15 @entity4 's @entity5 goalscoring record
both men now have 15 times at @entity5 finals
36 - year - old scored five times in 2002 and 2006 , and four in 2010
