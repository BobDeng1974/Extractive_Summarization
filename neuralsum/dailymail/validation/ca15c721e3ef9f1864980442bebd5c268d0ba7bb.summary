accessible only by a six - day boat journey from @entity2 or as part of epic month - long cruises through the @entity5 , @entity0 is about as far from a quick holiday destination as it gets			1
the world 's most remote inhabited archipelago stands 1,243 miles from @entity9 , its closest neighbour with residents , 1,491 miles from @entity2 and 2,088 miles from @entity12			1
it 's just seven miles long and 37.8 square miles in area , and has but one settlement officially known as @entity16 of the @entity17 , referred to by locals - less than 300 of them - as @entity19 , located at the foot of the 6,765 - foot queen mary 's peak			1
but despite its unimposing size and formidable remoteness , @entity0 has a rich history and a plethora of native wildlife that is truly unique			1
cruises , such as those which leave from @entity62 in @entity64 's @entity63 , are the most convenient way to see the island			2
one of 12 spaces can be filled on the fishing vessel @entity16 and the cargo ship @entity70			1
however , non-local tourists are at the bottom of an eight - tier priority pecking order that may include those responding to medical emergencies , official visitors and locals			0
the other cruise sails annually to @entity79 , run since 2012 by the @entity80 , and carries more than 40 passengers to and from @entity38			0
the local rockhopper penguins are hugely popular with visitors and live on all four of @entity38 's islands @entity50 ' @entity86 tours , the shortest and cheapest being the 27 - night tour from £ 3,929 ( @entity88 5,450 ) , calls in on @entity19 , and aims to land on @entity89 and @entity57 , which millions of seabirds call home			1
the landings are n't guaranteed though , with 30 per cent of attempts via zodiac boat since 1998 having been unsuccessful due to bad weather			0
thankfully , tours often factor in a spare day			0
on @entity89 , the wandering , yellow - nosed and sooty albatrosses all breed , and the @entity101 penguins that live on all four of the @entity102 are also hugely popular with those who manage to make it there			0
even with such attractions , tourism is a minor industry for @entity38 , with the majority of earnings coming from their commercial crawfish or @entity112 ( @entity113 ) operations and the sale of their unique postage stamps and coins to collectors			0
cruise operator @entity50 have four cruises that take in three - day stops at the @entity0 archipelago a yellow - nosed albatross is one of several large seabird species that uses @entity38 's @entity57 as a breeding ground two juvenile yellow - nosed albatross frolic on the island that is rich in wildlife but an effort to reach however , a range of accommodation is available in the form of home stays with locals - descendants of one of seven families originating from @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , the @entity140 and @entity141 - who also serve as guides and sell craft and souvenirs			1
all residents are farmers too , and the entire area is communally owned			2
historically , the island has proven an important stop for sailing ships needing a stopover in the @entity5 , and was annexed by the @entity151 in 1816 to ensure the @entity152 could n't use it as a base to attempt a rescue of @entity156 , who was imprisoned at @entity9			2
some typical housing in @entity16 , where all 297 locals of the @entity0 archipelago live hiking paths and rough roads are plentiful around the small and remote volcanic island the settlement was named in honour of the 1867 visit of @entity168 @entity167 's son @entity166 , the @entity43 , when the islands served as a @entity171 outpost called @entity172 , also said to have been used to monitor shipping movements in the ocean and the radio communications of @entity177 u-boats			1
prince @entity178 , the second @entity43 , also visited there on board the royal yacht britannia in 1957			0
just four years later , the entire population was forced to evacuate to @entity138 via @entity183 when @entity21 erupted			0
fortunately , the damage to @entity19 was found to be minimal and most residents returned in 1963			2
all of the local families are farmers of some kind , with cattle among the livestock , though fishing is also a massive part of their economy local social haunts include the cafe and the @entity196 , which by virtue of being on @entity38 is one of the world ’s most isolated pubs stamp collectors pay significant amounts for the rare @entity0 stamps , another major source of revenue for the town local residents all have a plot on the @entity209 where they primarily grow potatoes , a staple of the @entity38 diet supplies have to be brought into @entity38 's small harbour , while tourists from cruise ships must be brought to shore by zodiac the local penguin population was threatened in march 2011 when the @entity221 freighter ran aground and created a potentially devastating oil slick around @entity89 , which has no fresh water			1
rockhoppers had to be taken to @entity38 to be cleaned			0
the islands then got even more worldwide attention later the same year when @entity230 competitor @entity228 's @entity227 broke a mast during its journey from @entity233 to @entity183 and was forced to stop there			2
the town turned it on for the 11 person crew , who visited the local @entity239 , took a tour of the fish processing factory and picked up emergency supplies at the local shop .			0

from @entity0 it 's 1,243 miles to @entity9 , 1,491 miles to @entity2 and 2,088 miles to @entity12
its only town , @entity16 of the @entity17 , has less than 300 residents and is known as the settlement
millions of native birds , including several breeds of albatross and rockhopper penguin , call the *archipalego* home
