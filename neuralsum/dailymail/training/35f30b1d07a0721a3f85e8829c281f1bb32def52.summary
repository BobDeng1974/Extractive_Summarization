@entity0 was brought back down to earth with a bump by @entity3 in @entity4			2
four days after winning the @entity5 for a record ninth time , @entity0 lost his opening match on the grass 6 - 4 6 - 1 in less than an hour			1
@entity3 , the flamboyant and big hitting @entity10 - @entity9 , was not the man @entity0 would have wanted to meet as he tried to find his feet on the grass			2
bags packed : @entity0 did not last long at @entity4 , losing to @entity3 in straight sets war cry : @entity3 beat @entity0 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 in less than an hour hands up : @entity3 , ranked 85th , made light work of world no 1 @entity0 serial winner : @entity0 claimed a ninth @entity5 at @entity5 on sunday the world no 1 looked to have adjusted well in the first set but @entity3 , who beat @entity22 at @entity23 last year , broke serve in the 10th game and did not look back			1
in the opening five games of the second set , @entity0 won just five points and , although he stopped the rot eventually , 85th - ranked @entity3 confidently served out the best win of his life			1
@entity0 had said before leaving @entity33 that his expectations for @entity4 were not high but , having won just one match in two years at @entity23 , it is hardly ideal preparation			2
off the pace : the @entity38 will have to up his game if he is going to make any impact at @entity23 low key : @entity0 had said his hopes for success in @entity4 were not high room for improvement : @entity0 has only won one game at @entity23 in the last two years defending champion @entity47 avoided the same fate but did have a scare against @entity51 's @entity50			1
second seed @entity47 lost the opening set on a tie - break but recovered to win 6 - 7 ( 8/10 ) 6 - 4 6 - 2			0
the @entity54 was in a positive mood after the match , saying on the @entity58 's official website : ' it was slightly frustrating at times clearly , but nevertheless i served well and kept on doing my thing			0
' it was important to stay calm and actually i think it gives me more confidence winning this way			0
i had to stay calm , fight through the match and find a way and then the last set and a half were much better			0
so , i 'm actually pretty happy now			0
' @entity47 next meets @entity69 , who defeated @entity70 in two tie - breaks , while @entity73 @entity72 was given a walkover into the quarter - finals by @entity76			0
defending champion : @entity47 won in @entity4 last year and progressed after beating @entity50 winning mentality : the second seed saw off his @entity81 opponent in three sets , 6 - 7 ( 8/10 ) 6 - 4 6 - 2 next on the agenda : @entity47 will now face @entity69 in the next round of the tournament			1
