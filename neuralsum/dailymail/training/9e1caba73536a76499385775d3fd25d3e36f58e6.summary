@entity1 full back @entity0 believe 's he has ' definitely ' got the quality to play for @entity3			1
the 23 - year - old has been ever - present in @entity1 ' charge to second place in the @entity7 , making the right back shirt his own following @entity10 ' move to @entity11			1
he was rewarded with a first international call - up for last month 's @entity14 double header against @entity15 and @entity16 but was an unused substitute in both games			1
if you play well then you get picked up , ' he said			2
' i think i 've got the ability to play for my country , definitely			2
i 'm playing with lots of confidence			0
' hopefully i can get called up again and receive my first cap			0
' @entity1 needed a mis - hit clearance from @entity21 's third - choice goalkeeper @entity36 and wonderful 40 - yard strike from @entity38 to see off @entity21 on saturday , but their winning habit is becoming unshakeable			1
when previous boss @entity42 left for @entity43 in the summer and the likes of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 followed him out of the door , a season of struggle was widely predicted			2
@entity3 manager @entity50 was in attendance to see @entity1 duo @entity52 and @entity0 yet they have now won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions , with the meanest defence in the top flight and only @entity59 above them			1
unsurprisingly , spirits are high			0
' we keep winning and getting clean sheets , hopefully we can keep up our run of form and see where we go with it , ' said @entity0			1
' a few of the lads are talking about the @entity69 , @entity70 and stuff			0
but we 've just got to keep pushing and hopefully the results will take care of themselves			0
' @entity21 , meanwhile , were unable to build on battling draws at @entity11 and @entity75 in their previous two matches			1
the young full - back has been one of @entity1 's most impressive performers this season despite the slender scoreline , @entity1 were clearly the better side and could have added as many as three to their tally with better finishing			1
nevertheless , they would be forgiven for wondering what might have been had @entity36 , starting in the @entity7 for only the third time with @entity87 and @entity88 injured , not erred			2
he sent the ball straight to @entity38 when attempting to clear , leaving himself badly out of position as the ball sailed back into his net			2
but midfielder @entity94 insists the @entity95 must put the incident behind him as soon as possible			0
@entity0 was called up to train with the national squad but did n't make an actual appearance ' it 's been difficult for @entity36 , he 's been a long time out as second or third choice keeper and he came in and did ever so well at @entity75 last week , ' said @entity94			1
' he 's a good keeper , but he made a simple mistake and a lot of the time you can get away with those			0
' i 'm sure he will be dejected but he 's got to be a man about it and get his head up because it looks like he 'll be starting again next week			0
' you ca n't dwell on it			0
he has to look to the next game and try to improve			0

@entity1 beat @entity21 1 - 0 to keep pace with @entity59 in @entity7
@entity0 has impressed for the @entity1 this season
his performances earned him a call up from @entity50
but full back @entity0 is yet to actually make an appearance for @entity3
@entity0 said he is ' definitely ' good enough to play for @entity3
