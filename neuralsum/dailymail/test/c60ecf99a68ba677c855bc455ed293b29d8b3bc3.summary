@entity1 's leading pensions and savings expert will today be announced as a new @entity4 peer , who will appointed as minister for consumer protection if the party wins the election			1

dr @entity9 , pictured with @entity20 at @entity21 , a @entity22 in @entity23 , will today be announced as a new @entity4 peer dr @entity9 will oversee the government ’s pension reforms , which have allowed people to cash in retirement funds rather than being forced into buying often poor - value annuities			1
she will also steer through reforms designed to make it easier for customers to move to another bank , by allowing customers to take their account number with them			2
‘ for too many years , consumer rights have played second fiddle to the interests of large financial firms , but the new pension freedoms show that the @entity4 have put the interests of @entity1 savers first , ’ dr @entity9 said			1
‘ i passionately believe the new pension reforms , trusting people with their own money , are an essential step to helping everyone make the most of their hard - earned savings			2
' @entity20 and @entity53 have proved to me that they want to help the many , not just the few at the top , by giving the same freedoms to everyone as were already enjoyed by the wealthiest			0
‘ in doing so , they took on the large companies who had too often taken advantage of their customers and have paved the way for a new environment for long - term savings			0
the conservatives have created the opportunity for working families to save more if and when they can , knowing they will be allowed to use the money as best suits their circumstances			0
dr @entity9 , a former @entity10 adviser who went on to head over- @entity11 , would take responsibility for protecting people from rip - off pension and mortgage charges ‘ that is right , but of course it will also require a change of mindset from providers and potentially further action from @entity27 to protect consumers			1
it will be my job to try to ensure customers get a better deal and i am delighted to be offered the chance to do so			0
‘ charge caps , impartial financial guidance , help with financial planning , financial education at all ages , and more competition for savers ’ money will all help and it will be great to have the opportunity to play a direct role in looking after the public			0
’ the prime minister said : ‘ what we ’re doing is taking the country ’s leading expert on pensions , on savings , on financial education , @entity9 , and saying that if we ’re re-elected , she ’ll be at the heart of government , making sure we complete this great revolution where we ’re giving people much more power to save , to access their pension , to pass their pension on to their children , because we want to create a real savings culture in our country for everybody			1
' not for the rich at the top , but for everybody who saves or has a pension			0
' ‘ this will be good for everybody			0
we ’ve got millions more people saving for a pension because of auto - enrolment - having an automatic pension in your workplace - so there are many more people saving			0
' there are also great new products like the flexible @entity134 , a real encouragement for savings with the single tier pension , and now at the heart of government , if we ’re elected , @entity9 - the country ’s leading pensions , savings , and financial education expert to make sure that we make the most of this great revolution in favour of savings and financial security for many in our country			1
