the brave young men of the lethal @entity9 had been trained in the art of sabotage - from booby traps to ' time pencil ' fuses			1
now , a collection of @entity16 artefacts is up for auction which sheds light on the nation 's secret last line of defence			1

a collection of @entity16 artefacts from the deadly @entity9 wing of the @entity27 has come to light , including cleverly disguised manuals on bomb - making and sabotage			1
the manuals were disguised as calendars and fertiliser guides ( above ) the items for sale belonged to @entity30 , a chemical factory owner - turned - guerrilla fighter charged with heading the sabotage division of his local cell of the @entity9			1
the resistance division was the brainchild of @entity51 , who ordered a network of hidden bunkers to be set up around the country in case of invasion by @entity6 's troops			1
@entity58 is one of @entity30 's bomb fuses the @entity9 was the brainchild of @entity51 , who ordered a network of hidden bunkers to be set up around the country in case of invasion by @entity6 ’s troops			1
the unit ’s creation came after the @entity64 suffered heavy losses and had to be evacuated from @entity66 in northern @entity67 in mid- 1940			0
many of the concealed bases were in @entity70 , the most probable landing point for @entity6 ’s planned attack @entity72			2
their very existence was on a strictly need - to - know basis and they were manned by only the most trusted members of the community			2
the volunteer members were trained in guerrilla warfare as assassins and saboteurs with orders to attack from behind enemy lines should the @entity82 invade			1
@entity30 ( above ) was one of six men based at a hideout at @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87			2
hidden in woodland , it boasted a hydraulic entrance that had been fitted by the local garage owner the artefacts are tipped to fetch a total of £ 3,000 when they go under the hammer next week			2
above , @entity30 's radio transmitter among @entity30 's collection of mementos are manuals on how to make bombs using readily available chemicals and how to set booby traps members anticipated being shot if they were captured , and were expected to shoot themselves rather than be taken alive			1
thankfully , victory for the @entity64 in the @entity105 put paid to @entity6 ’s plans for invasion and the @entity9 were never called into action			2
amazingly , the unit ’s existence only became public knowledge many years after the end of the war			0

' fearing a @entity185 invasion , @entity51 recruited the most trusted men in the community to form small bands of resistance fighters dotted around the country			2
' the idea was that should the @entity185 invade , the @entity9 members would hide in their network of secret bunkers from where they could spring surprise attacks			1
' the @entity9 members , usually young men , were trained in sabotage , fighting and bomb - making			1
' they were like the @entity201 of the @entity27			0
' @entity30 ran the local chemicals factory and was so trusted he was made @entity203 in a six - man patrol based at @entity85 in @entity86			2
' originally , the patrol had been based at another secret location but their hideout had been stumbled upon by two courting lovers			0
' while they were relocating , @entity210 had to take all the equipment back to his home , which was very worrying for him as he knew by doing so he was putting his family in danger			0
' the possessions from his time in the unit are fascinating			0
' among the highlights are two secret manuals on how to make bombs and booby traps plus the radio receiver and telephone from the base			0
' with much of the fighting taking place in @entity227 it ’s easy to forget the brave people who stayed at home to defend their country			0
