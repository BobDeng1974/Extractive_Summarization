@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 was freed on christmas day after spending four months in a women 's prison			1
she is still however stuck in the country as the government will not return her passport			1
this as her mother , @entity17 , begs people around the world to help and get her daughter back home , even starting a petition on @entity23			1
finally free : after four months in prison , @entity9 ( above ) was finally released from an @entity5 jail on @entity26 stark conditions : she was incarcerated at @entity28 where she shared a cell with several other prisoners , including a women who just gave birth to a baby , and cares for the child behind bars false charge : she was jailed after sharing a cab with a man she did not know who was smuggling meth @entity41 reports that nothing has been said by the government on when @entity44 might be able to return back to the @entity1 , and when she might get her passport back			1
in the meantime , she is staying with former @entity5 president and @entity50 laureate @entity49			2
