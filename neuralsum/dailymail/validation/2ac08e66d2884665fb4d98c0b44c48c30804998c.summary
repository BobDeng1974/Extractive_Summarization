classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia , new research has found			2
scientists discovered that patients who listened to experts of @entity7 had enhanced gene activity in the brain in areas including memory and learning			1
meanwhile , the music also affected the activity of a risk gene connected to @entity16			1
classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia by enhancing gene activity in the brain , new research has found the @entity23 researchers found the changed activity was only present in ' musically - experienced ' patients , who listened to music regularly , suggesting the importance of familiarity with music			1
for the study , participants were asked to listen to @entity7 's violin concert no 3 , g - major , @entity34 , a piece that lasts 20 minutes			1
the experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants			2
the research involved participants listening to @entity7 ( pictured ) for 20 minutes the study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed ' musically experienced ' in areas such as dopamine secretion , which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain , synaptic neurotransmission , which is how neurons receive information , and learning and memory			1
meanwhile , the music appeared to down - regulate genes associated with neuro - degeneration , which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons			0
the researchers said several of the up - regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds			0
this suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species , they said			0
one of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein - alpha ( @entity68 ) , which is also a known risk gene for @entity16			1
study leader doctor @entity71 , of @entity72 , said : ' the up - regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans			0
' he added : ' the effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants , suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music - induced effects			2
' dr @entity71 added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy			0
the effects of this are still largely unknown .			0

@entity97 saw patients listen to @entity7 's violin concert no 3 for 20 minutes
the ' musically - experienced ' *people* had enhanced gene activity , it found
music also affected risk gene synuclein - alpha , connected to @entity16 's
