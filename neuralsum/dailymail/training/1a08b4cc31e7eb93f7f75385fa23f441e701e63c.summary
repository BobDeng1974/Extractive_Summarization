by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 10:21 am on 10th january 2012 speculation is mounting that the president 's chief of staff was been effectively forced out by @entity6 's move to the left ahead of this year 's election			1
president @entity6 announced yesterday that @entity8 , who was hired to forge links with big business and @entity11 republicans , is stepping down from his post , making him his third chief of staff to quit in three years			1
mr @entity6 has aggressively targeted @entity11 , which he says has blocked the workings of government , and is looking to strike a more populist economic tone ahead of his re-election campaign			1
moving on : president @entity6 announced at the @entity18 today that his chief of staff @entity8 , right , would be resigning and replaced by budget director @entity19 , left mr @entity8 is resigning after only a year on the job - to return to his native @entity21 and spend more time with his family , he says			1
he will be replaced by budget director @entity19 , whom the president called the ' clear choice ' for one of the toughest jobs in @entity28 mr @entity19 will be the third permanent chief of staff in mr @entity6 's presidency - in the midst of a re-election year			1
@entity8 is a lawyer who made his career in banking			0
he is the son of @entity34 , who was mayor of @entity21 for 21 years			0
mr @entity8 served as @entity36 chairman of @entity37 from 2004 until president @entity6 picked him for chief of staff			1
he was secretary of commerce under president @entity40 from 1997 until 2000 and helped with the passage of the @entity42			0
mr @entity8 has stepped down from his chief of staff post after just one year			1
mr @entity8 , 63 , was considered a centrist @entity44 with close ties to big business , having worked in the pharmaceuticals industry and as a top lobbyist for bank @entity37			0
now that mr @entity6 is in re-election mode , bashing business and the @entity11 and seeking to define himself in opposition to @entity11 , this could have made mr @entity8 an awkward fit in the @entity18			2
' the @entity8 departure marks the end of @entity6 ’s attempt to look pro-business , ' conservative commentator @entity54 told @entity58 , predicting that the president would now be ' playing to his ideologically motivated left - wing base '			0
and a former top congressional aide for the @entity62 told the @entity63 : ' @entity64 was brought in for two things : he has a good connection to the business community and a record of working with @entity69			0
' the former aide claimed that @entity11 ' do n't want to be worked with ' , meaning that mr @entity8 ended up as ' an ineffective chief of staff '			1
mr @entity6 's difficult relationship with @entity11 - which has worsened rather than improved while mr @entity8 has been in office - deteriorated further last week when he took advantage of a one - day @entity75 ' recess ' to appoint @entity76 to head a new consumer watchdog body			2
@entity78 was ' distressed ' by the dominance of @entity21 politics by ' white @entity82 ' families , according to a new book			0
the @entity86 , by @entity85 journalist @entity84 , claims that when mrs @entity78 worked for the city 's mayor she complained that ' power in @entity90 was locked up generation after generation by a small group of families '			0
@entity64 , who has just resigned as white house chief of staff , is a member of one of the families supposedly criticised by mrs @entity78			2
during the 1990s she worked for his father , mayor @entity99			0
the current mayor of @entity21 is @entity34 , brother of the former chief of staff			2
the @entity86 were particularly ' horrified ' when @entity102 , now a close confidante of the president and @entity105 , was forced out of her high - ranking job at @entity21 's @entity107 in 1995 , according to ms @entity84 's book			2
mrs @entity78 's hostility to @entity21 's dynastic politics may help to explain mr @entity8 's mysterious resignation yesterday			2
she is also reported to have clashed with @entity112 , mr @entity8 's predecessor as chief of staff			1
' @entity115 choice ' : @entity19 , left , has been mr @entity6 's budget director since july 2010 , and also served as a special assistant to president @entity40 @entity112 ( 2009 - 2010 ) - previously serving as a top adviser to president @entity40 , @entity112 is no stranger to politics			1
he was announced as president @entity6 's chief of staff two days after he was elected president			1
mr @entity112 resigned in 2010 to run for mayor of @entity21			0
he won that election , and still holds the post today			0

@entity19 ( 2012 - ) - @entity136 @entity19 , or @entity19 , has two separate stints as presidential budget director - once under @entity40 and most recently under president @entity6 - and deputy secretary of state under @entity40 's wife @entity140			1
with the departure of @entity8 , he will become president @entity6 's chief of staff next month			1
mr @entity8 , 63 , has previously stated this would be his last year with the @entity6 administration , and would hang on to see the president through his tough re-election bid			1
but today he expressed to his boss a desire to get back to his family in @entity21 , where @entity150 have dominated @entity21 politics for decades			0
he 's the brother of recently retired @entity21 mayor @entity34 and the youngest son of legendary @entity21 mayor @entity99			0
mr @entity6 chose @entity8 to be his @entity18 chief of staff back in january 2011 , but the former banker and veteran political fighter has had a somewhat tumultuous tenure			1
in the very least , the job has not seemed like the best fit for him			0
he was brought in to improve relations with the business community , @entity69 lawmakers and others with whom he had built ties over the years			0
his attempts to create a ‘ grand bargain ’ to solve the debt and deficit row fell apart in the face of @entity173 hardliners , who refused to back down			0
in november , it was reported that mr @entity8 was handing over many of his day to day tasks to @entity176 , one of mr @entity6 's close allies			2
despite those assertions , mr @entity6 today said that mr @entity8 had performed ' extraordinary work ' in an ' extraordinary year '			2
@entity18 officials said that to the degree mr @entity8 deserved blame for any missteps , he also deserves credit for his work during a remarkably demanding year that ended on a high for @entity6 , with a political victory over @entity188 in getting a payroll tax cut extended			2
mr @entity6 said : ' no one in my administration has had to make more important decisions more quickly than @entity40			0
and that 's why i think this decision was difficult for me			0
' a @entity62 strategist familiar with the decision said mr @entity8 was not pushed out the door			0
the strategist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the timing was driven by mr @entity8 's personal reflection , yet it also only would have gotten more awkward for the @entity18 had he not left before mr @entity6 's tone - setting @entity204			2
praise : in a speech today , president @entity6 applauded mr @entity8 as a man who had performed ' extraordinary work ' in an ' extraordinary year ' questionable departure ? former white house chief of staff @entity112 , right , denied that he resigned his post amid strained tensions with first lady @entity78 , left mr @entity8 was also criticised for hurting middle income families with the @entity42 trade deals he helped sign while serving as @entity215 under @entity40 between 1997 and 2000			1
both mr @entity8 and mr @entity19 stood at @entity6 's side today as the president delivered brief remarks , but neither man spoke			1
mr @entity8 replaced @entity112 , who is now @entity21 's mayor			2
according to a new book examining the relationship of president @entity6 and his wife @entity222 , mr @entity112 departed amid strained tensions with the first lady			2
the book , titled @entity226 , mentions several examples where mr @entity112 tried to avoid working with mrs @entity78 after his experiences with @entity140 during @entity40 's tenure as president			1
speaking in @entity21 today , mr @entity112 disputed that reporting , saying , ' i ’m very proud to have worked for the president and the first lady , and [ my wife ] @entity234 and i are very proud to call them friends			0
' mr @entity8 served as commerce secretary under president @entity40 and ran @entity130 's 2000 presidential campaign			1
stepping in now is the mild - mannered @entity19 , who began his career on @entity240 , where he spent nearly a decade as principal domestic policy adviser to the late house speaker @entity242			0
mr @entity19 , 56 , has worked for @entity6 as a deputy secretary of state before becoming budget director , the same position he held in the @entity40 administration			1
