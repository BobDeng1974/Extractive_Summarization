@entity0 tipped @entity1 to become only the third @entity3 star ever to be inducted into the club ’s @entity4 while still an @entity7 player			1
the @entity9 international left back opted to remain with @entity3 after they lurched into administration in february 2012 and were then liquidated that summer			1
@entity0 believes the 26 - year - old ’s loyalty , combined with his performances on the park while @entity3 have travelled up the divisions , is destined for reward once the final stage of the journey is completed			1
backing : @entity1 has had a boost from boss @entity0 the @entity3 boss is certain that @entity1 will one day follow in the footsteps of former @entity3 captain @entity21 and current skipper @entity22 in becoming @entity4 players while still pulling on a light blue jersey			1
‘ @entity1 has been fantastic for me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ along with our captain , @entity22 , he has been absolutely vital in giving us the stability on the park after administration and liquidation			1
‘ we badly needed to have that stability , and i also count @entity32 ( the former @entity3 goalkeeper who is now at @entity33 ) in that , too			2
stability : @entity1 has been at @entity7 through thick and thin ‘ but the contributions of @entity1 and @entity22 , in particular , have been so valuable over the past two seasons			1
and i fully expect it to be the same this coming season in the @entity39			0
‘ it would be fantastic for those two boys to have on their cv that they went through the leagues as captain and vice-captain of @entity3			2
they have already shown great loyalty to stay here			2
and by going from playing at @entity49 and @entity50 all the way back to the top flight in @entity54 football ? well that would be a great story alright			2
‘ i look at the names of the @entity56 as i walk up the marble staircase at @entity7			0
i know @entity22 ’s name is on it already , but , although i might be biased , i think @entity1 is an absolute certainty to join him			1
and there would be no - one more deserving			0
’ @entity0 also describe as ‘ invaluable ’ the contribution made by both @entity1 and @entity22 off the park , in helping newcomers cope with the pressures of playing for @entity3			1
he said : ‘ the most important aspect is on the park because you need to win games – and they have been outstanding for me			0
but it ’s every aspect , really			0
‘ they ’ve helped the guys who came into @entity3 and , to be honest , did n’t know that much about the club			2
they ’ve coaxed them through the difficult moments			0
like when you are 3 - 0 up at @entity7 and you get the odd boo for a bad pass			0
‘ that can be tough to take for someone who does not know this club and its surroundings			0
' so i simply can not tell you how important @entity1 and @entity22 have been for this club			1
‘ if i had n’t had guys like that to call on , my job would have been so much harder			0
‘ they deserve an enormous amount of praise from the supporters and from ourselves as the management team for helping us through this period			0
