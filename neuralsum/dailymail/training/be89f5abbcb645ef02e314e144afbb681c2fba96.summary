once the pride and glory of @entity4 shipbuilding , the @entity0 has been rusting away in @entity5 for nearly half a century – but now the historic vessel may get a new lease on life			1
@entity0 is getting a below - the - deck makeover to make it more appealing for developers interested in turning what was once the world 's fastest ocean liner into a massive dockside attraction			1
workers began a project in october to remove tanks and other materials from the belly of the ship to make way for modern utilities systems that would need to go in to transform it			0
@entity4 's flagship : workers began a project in october to transform @entity0 into a massive dockside attraction sad tale ; the nonprofit group that owns the long - retired ship warns that the historic vessel could be sold as scrap there is a second objective to the project , which is expected to last well into 2014 : selling the materials to raise the $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 it takes each month to maintain and insure the vessel			1
the @entity0 , the nonprofit group that owns the ship , warns that if its grand plans do not come together quickly , there might be no choice but to sell the historic liner as scrap			2
‘ it 's a great fixer - upper , ’ said @entity45 , executive director of the @entity0 and the granddaughter of @entity47 , the ship 's @entity5 - born designer , on a tour of the ship			2
@entity0 is 990 feet long – over 100 feet longer than @entity52			1
no wood had been used in its construction or fittings - except for a special fireproof @entity57 piano			2
the vessel was designed to be just wide enough ( 101 feet ) so it could pass through the locks of the @entity61 with two feet of clearance on either side			0
on her maiden voyage , the @entity0 shattered the trans - @entity67 speed record in both directions			1
everyone from @entity71 to @entity72 , @entity73 and president @entity74 crossed the @entity67 aboard the storied vessel			2
how to use the ship – five city blocks long and a monument to shimmery aluminum and the sleek lines of mid- 20th - century @entity81 - has been a conundrum for more than 40 years			0
belly of the beast : the engine room of the @entity0 , which still holds the record for speediest trans - @entity67 voyage failed plan : the ship was partially funded by the @entity91 with the idea that it could be converted one day into an extremely efficient troop transporter , but the plan never came to fruition fall from grace : this first class cabin area of the @entity0 was at one time swarming with political luminaries and @entity98 stars like @entity99 and @entity100 eyesore : the liner has been oxidizing in a pier across the street from a shopping center in @entity5 the @entity0 was launched in 1952 as the world 's fastest ocean liner , and it still holds the record for speediest trans - @entity67 voyage			1
the ship was partially funded by the @entity91 with the idea that it could be converted one day into an extremely efficient troop transporter			0
but it was never called to service by the government			0
and by 1969 , after carrying four presidents , @entity118 of @entity119 , @entity120 and a million other people across the @entity67 , it was retired from its regular duties			1
glory days : @entity0 was the winner of the @entity125 for 1952 with a transatlantic crossing speed of 41 mph infamous boat : @entity0 is over 100 feet longer than @entity52 , which sank in 1912 @entity128 : the ocean liner is pictured during its launch at the @entity132 yard , @entity133 , june 21 , 1952 ( right ) familiar face : popular film and tv star @entity136 is shown handing in his ticket before boarding @entity0 in 1955 for a three - month visit in @entity139 the hulking ship has been berthed on the @entity143 in @entity5 since 1996 , its once - bold red , white and blue paint faded and its iron oxidizing in a pier across the street from a shopping center			1
over the years , plans to make the @entity0 into a cruise ship have failed , partly because it was designed for speed , not slow - moving recreation , and is narrower than modern cruise ships			1
the conservancy used a $ 5.8million gift from a @entity5 philanthropist in 2010 to buy the ship			0
the group 's vision is different from others that came before			0
it wants to turn it into a multiuse attraction , perhaps with restaurants , a hotel and banquet facilities , along with a maritime history museum			0
need for speed : plans to make the @entity0 into a cruise ship have failed because it was designed for speed some retired naval ships - including the @entity172 in nearby @entity173 and the @entity174 in @entity175 - have been turned into museums			1
but the high overhead costs of keeping a boat floating , even if it 's stationary , can bring financial difficulties			0
despite fundraising efforts , the @entity0 owners would have a difficult time paying basic bills without selling some scrap			2
there is at least one model for the sort of development the @entity0 owners have in mind			2
the @entity191 opened three years ago with a hotel , museum and school in its namesake city in the @entity196			0

aboard the ship , @entity224 said it 's in better shape than it appears , and a level in the navigation bridge shows that it 's not hewing either way			0
‘ it 's benefited from being over-engineered , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 was launched in 1952 and shattered trans - @entity67 speed record in both directions
at 990feet the boat is 100 feet longer than @entity52
four @entity4 presidents and much of the @entity98 elite traveled aboard @entity0
boat was retired in 1969 and has been berthed on @entity143 since 1996
