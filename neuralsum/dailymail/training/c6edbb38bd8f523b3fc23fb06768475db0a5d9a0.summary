‘ having spoken to the manager @entity47 and also the people above him , they ’re very aggressive and they want success			2

that ’s how i want to finish my career , so they are the reasons i chose @entity2			1
their pursuing me was very aggressive			2
they basically told me what i wanted to hear			2
i hope i can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team			2
’ @entity0 remain a @entity27 player for the next six months and the midfielder stopped short of posing for photos holding @entity2 's shirt , presumably out of respect for the @entity69 supporters			1

i 'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that 's the team i will join at the end of the season			2
their pursuing me was very aggressive			2
the talks @entity94 had with them are very positive , they basically told me what i wanted to hear			2
they told me about the winning mentality of the club , their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so i will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there			1
there 's obviously a bonus of where the @entity2 are locateed as well			1
that will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different			2
it 's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that i go there and it 's a success on the pitch and then hopefully i can enjoy it off the pitch as well			2
the big challenge is going to be settling in , i 've lived in @entity27 all my life			1
i 'm a scouser through and through			0
but , you only get one life , it 's important to try different things and experiences and it 's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well			0
it 's perfect timing for this new challenge			0
i 'm really excited and looking forward to it , but i 've still got a few things that i 've got to try and achieve before i go so my focus is on that			0
there will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move			0
it 's the right time for a new challenge , a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too			0
i 'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the @entity160			0
i 've watched a lot of their games and i also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and i 've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career i believe the timing is right to move on			0
