tragedy : @entity6 , a six - year - old @entity7 , died from internal bleeding following a routine operation			1
he 's pictured on the right with owner @entity21 heartbroken owner @entity22 , 22 , is now demanding answers from the companion care practice inside the @entity26 store in @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity22 , a receptionist , said : ' we were told it was just routine and nothing to worry about			1
' at 2pm that day , i got a call from the vet , who told me that the operation went well and we could pick him up			0
' when i got there after work at about 6pm , @entity6 was laid on the floor , completely out of it			2
shock : shadow with owner @entity22 , who spoke of her devastation at her dog 's death ' the vet kept reassuring me he was completely fine , just sleepy , so he put @entity6 on a stretcher and put him in the back of my car			1
' when i arrived home we had to carry him out of the car , and he was just a fluffy lump			0
' he lay on the kitchen floor and did n't move			0
' we rang the vet several times , and he kept saying @entity6 would be fine			2
' i stayed on the floor with him , cuddling up to him and crying because i wanted him to wake up so much			0
two hours later he died			2
' an independent post mortem revealed that @entity6 died from internal bleeding when 2.5 litres of blood leaked inside his abdomen			1
it named vet @entity70 as the clinician and said a ligature on @entity6 's testicular blood vessels and tubes was not in place			1
an independent post mortem revealed that 2.5 litres of blood leaked inside @entity6 's abdomen @entity22 raised @entity6 from a pup with her parents @entity21 , 54 , and @entity81 , 49 , and siblings @entity82 , 28 , and 25 - year - old @entity84 , at their home in @entity27			1
tearful @entity22 said : ' he was a completely healthy , all he had was a tumour that was benign so we were told he would have to be castrated			1
' that night he was dead , and it 's all the vet 's fault for botching the surgery			0
' the post mortem says if he had put these ties around the inside of the wound properly , he would have been fine			0
' i wish i had questioned the vet more but he 's a qualified vet so you just think that they are right			0
' we are all devastated , he was such a great dog just full of life			0
' he was a bit of a bull in a china shop because he thought he was tiny , so he would sit on us and crush us			0
' you could n't ask for a better pet , friend and companion - he was perfect			0
' loved : mrs @entity22 said that @entity6 was the perfect pet the post mortem was carried out at the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			1
the official report by independent veterinary pathologists reads : ' there was evidence of significant abdominal haemorrhage			0
' the quantity of bloody fluid in the abdomen was sufficient to cause the death of this animal and appears to have come from the left spermatic cord where the ligature was not in place			2
' other documentation shows the practice also failed to monitor the dog 's post-op recovery every 15 minutes until he was ' fully awake			2
' @entity22 paid £ 200 for the operation which took place on friday june 20 and had the money refunded			1
she added : ' @entity6 's death was down to human error and internal bleeding in the abdomen			1
' the vets paid for the post mortem and have offered to pay for his cremation , which makes them look guilty			0
' if they knew they were n't at fault , they would n't bother , would they ? ' mr @entity70 himself has just been blasé about everything , which is even more annoying because if it was me , i do n't think i could even touch another animal after that			0
' he has just showed no remorse at all , no compassion and it 's ridiculous			0
' i do n't want him to be able to go near another animal ever again because no one should have to go through what we went through			0
' nothing will bring @entity6 back but we want the vet to know how much he has hurt us and he should n't be allowed to operate ever again			2
' reaction : the companion care practice at @entity26 in @entity27 has offered its sympathies to @entity6 's owners the @entity164 practice has a three - and - a - half star review on @entity166 with some negative comments from pet owners			1
one wrote : ' avoid this place at all costs ! took my dog here three years ago			2
he was so ill but diagnosed with an upset stomach and sent home but died the next day ! ' companion care said : ' the loss of a much loved pet is tragic in any circumstances and we extend our deepest sympathy to @entity6 's family			1
' with the agreement of @entity6 's owners we arranged for a post mortem examination by an independent veterinary surgeon at the @entity110 and are investigating the findings in detail with @entity6 's owners			2
' we have offered our full support at this difficult time			0
