by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 27 november 2013 people who suffer repeated blows to the head , such as footballers like @entity5 who often header the ball , are more likely to develop @entity7 's people who suffer repeated blows to the head are more likely to develop alzheimer ’s disease , new research suggests			1
possible links between contact sports and an increased risk of developing dementia have previously been identified but no firm scientific ties have been established			0
now , researchers from the @entity18 have developed a more detailed picture of how the disease takes root , which could provide a better understanding			0
they used laser imaging to identify clusters of a protein , called tau , on the brains of sufferers and found possible links to neuronal damage , for example through head injuries inflicted during sport			1
dr @entity34 , head of research at @entity36 , welcomed the development			0
he said : ‘ the state - of - the - art technology used by this research team allows a unique insight into the molecular events that occur in @entity7 's			1
‘ investigating how the tau protein spreads between nerve cells can help researchers better understand what causes the disease and offer new approaches for treatments			2
‘ it is unclear from this study whether head injury could trigger this molecular process , but it is a risk factor for dementia that needs to be investigated further			0
’ the study , reported in @entity56 , focused on the tau protein			2
this is found inside healthy brain cells but clusters of malfunctioning tau , which prevent brain cells from working properly , are found in the brains of those who have died with @entity7 's			1
when small quantities of the protein were added to the outside of brain cells , the cells immediately started to ingest it , the study found			2
the resulting clumping caused healthy proteins to misbehave			0
in real life such clumping could be triggered by repeated head injuries , such as those suffered in contact sports			0
researchers used laser imaging to identify clusters of a protein , called tau , on the brains of sufferers and found possible links to neuronal damage , for example through head injuries inflicted during sport			1
@entity90 suffered years of blows to the head and was later diagnosed with @entity94 's disease researchers urged caution , saying that their study used a model cell culture and the processes which enable the disease to take root and develop in the brain could be far more complicated			2
@entity102 , professor of chemical physics at the @entity18 , who led the research , said : ‘ these are molecular - level glimpses of what may be going on			0
‘ we are just beginning to see the molecular steps that may provide an explanation for what we see in the brains of patients who have died of @entity7 's			1
it was revealed in september that former footballer @entity115 has @entity7 's disease ‘ the study underlines how significant the uptake of small quantities of tau might be as an initiator for the conditions that then prevail in the brains of @entity7 's sufferers			1
‘ it is one piece in the puzzle that could provide us with an explanation as to why head injuries may be connected to the disease			0
it 's not necessarily correct - but it is plausible			0
’ although links between @entity7 's and contact sport are yet to be firmly established , previous studies have found professional @entity138 footballers are three times more likely to have neurodegenerative diseases compared with the general public			1
earlier this year the @entity142 reached a multimillion - pound settlement to compensate more than 4,500 retired players diagnosed with conditions including dementia , depression or @entity7 's which they blamed on blows to the head			1
researchers trying to find a cure for @entity7 's have long focused on the role of tau - an abbreviation of @entity156 - and this is the first insight into how the dysfunctional protein emerges and spreads			1
dr @entity159 , who led biological aspects of the research , said : ‘ we still do not know if we can stop cells from ingesting tau , or whether we can somehow wash tau out of the brain fluid			2
‘ answering these questions is key to developing future therapies to treat what remains , at the moment , a terrible and incurable disease			0

clusters of a protein called tau on the brains of people with @entity7 's could be linked to neuronal damage caused by repeated blows to the head
malfunctioning tau proteins prevent brain cells working properly
professional @entity138 footballers are three times more likely to have neurodegenerative diseases compared with the general public
