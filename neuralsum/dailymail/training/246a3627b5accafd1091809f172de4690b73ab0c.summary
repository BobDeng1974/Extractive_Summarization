from @entity5 who , after being married at the age of 10 , was raped and beaten by her much older husband to 13 - year - old @entity7 who , in 2010 , died from internal bleeding four days after being forcibly married , the plight of @entity2 's child brides makes for harrowing reading			1
but following international condemnation and campaigns by charities such as @entity15 and @entity16 , the country 's government finally appears ready to end the shocking tradition once and for all			0
@entity19 , the director general of @entity2 's @entity20 , has revealed that the country 's minister for @entity23 , @entity21 , is to submit a bill that would outlaw child marriages if passed			1
protest : a former child bride attends a demonstration against the practice in the @entity2 capital @entity29 and in a sign that attitudes might finally be changing in the @entity35 country , it was reported last week that police officers stepped in to prevent the marriage of a nine - year - old girl in the southern city of @entity40 - the first time such an intervention has taken place			2
according to reports on the @entity47 website , police halted the wedding and convinced the father of the girl , named locally as @entity50 , not to allow the nuptials to go ahead			2
although there is nothing currently to prevent @entity50 's wedding from happening at a later date , campaigners are cautiously welcoming of the intervention and the news that legislation could be imminent			2
' in 2009 , the @entity2 parliament considered a draft bill that fixed the minimum age of marriage for girls at age 17 and included penalties and punishment for those in violation , ' said @entity16 's @entity35 and @entity71 consultant , @entity70			1
' unfortunately this was not successful , but we are heartened that the @entity2 human rights minister @entity74 has requested the reintroduction of this bill , which would effectively ban child marriages in the country			1
' rescued : @entity79 , 8 , ( left ) and nine year - old @entity80 were granted divorces after being forcibly married in 2008 she added : ' along with our local partners , the @entity83 , we wholeheartedly support the minister and the @entity86 in their efforts to ensure that the government of @entity2 lives up to its obligations under international law by passing a law prohibiting child marriage so that girls are no longer forced to undergo the harmful physical and psychological effects of child marriage			1
' it is also promising that the government appears to be be taking steps to deal with this issue head - on and protect girls from this devastating abuse			0
' cases recorded since 2008 include that of 11 - year - old @entity102 who was married in 2010 to a 40 - year - old farmer who repeatedly raped and tortured her and 13 - year - old @entity104 , who in 2009 , was married to a 70 - year - old man			1
while many cases end in tragedy , @entity102 was one of the lucky ones after @entity16 and local partner @entity110 ( @entity83 ) successfully helped her obtain a divorce			0
' my message to other parents is that they should not think of marrying their daughters at a young age , girls should go to school , ' said @entity102			0
' i do nâ€™t want any girl to suffer as i did			0
girls should be educated in order to be able to live happily and in dignity			0

the @entity2 minister for @entity23 is to put forward a bill to ban it
since 2008 , cases of brides as young as nine have come to light
