but at the same time , another politician was making a name for himself as he clawed for his own slice of power			2
running with the message of ' vote the humans out ' , @entity4 the cat secured an impressive third place in the battle for the @entity10 seat in @entity11 after receiving nearly 7,000 votes			1
the nine - year - old @entity26 from @entity27 found himself in the election spotlight as part of a spoof campaign run by his owner manager @entity31 , who launched @entity4 's own website and @entity35 feed and even produced a video trailer			1
@entity4 eventually lost out to @entity38 @entity37 , who beat rival @entity40 @entity39 to the @entity10 by a margin of 200,000 votes			1
but the prank did serve a more serious purpose by helping to raise more than $ 16,000 for animal rescue groups			0
after the election , a @entity48 supporter filed an online petition asking that president @entity52 ' make @entity53 an honorary member of the @entity55 ' @entity10 '			0
to have a chance to being reviewed by the @entity13 , it would have needed 25,000 signatures			0
but a few days later it was taken down because it was ' in violation of our @entity62 ' , according to a note on the @entity13 's @entity66 website			0
writing on his @entity85 page , he said : ' when i started this campaign , i was just a cat - a wonderful , fluffy , cute cat , no doubt			1
' but today , i now belong to each and every one of you , and i will continue to be yours for all time			0
' he has not ruled out a return to politics , however , and insists that public ' will certainly be the first to know ' if he does .			2

nine - year - old @entity26 secured an impressive 7,000 votes
had his own @entity85 page and even featured in campaign video
lost out to @entity38 @entity37 who beat rival @entity40 @entity39
@entity4 has since announced his *retirement* , but has *n't* ruled out return
