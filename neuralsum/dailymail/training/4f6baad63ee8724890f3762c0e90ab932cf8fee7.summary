' the red - haired preschooler was clearly excited to share his views , confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster - y voice			2
still attempting to get her soundbite , ms @entity13 asked again how @entity0 had enjoyed his ride , only to get more of his adorable perspective on life			2
moment in the spotlight : @entity0 confidently held the microphone and spoke in a somewhat newscaster - y voice perk of the job : the clearly amused reporter , @entity13 , is just seen crouching down to speak at @entity0 's level , while a little girl tries to get her fifteen seconds of fame too ' well , it was great because apparently you ’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy , that ’s all you do is get dizzy , ' he said			1
' i ’ve never ever been on live television			0
