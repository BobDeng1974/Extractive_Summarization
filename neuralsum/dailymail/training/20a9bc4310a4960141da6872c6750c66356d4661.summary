the @entity0 has launched a new 12 million gallon indoor ocean the size of a football field to test its future warships			1
the high - tech facility is based at the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) in @entity7			1
the tank was first built in 1962 but for the past six years it has undergone a dramatic renovation			1
originally , the facility had a large pneumatic wave making machine			1
these have been replaced by 216 individually - controlled electro - mechanical wave boards			1
making waves : the new high - tech machine , can create any type of sea condition at the push of a button according to engineers at the facility , the new wave machine produces more precise data @entity24 , head of the @entity26 architecture and engineering department said : ' this new finger - style technology provides the @entity0 with an unprecedented capability to create a realistic ocean environment inside of the facility , which enables us to collect more precise test data ' this upgrade , along with the size of the facility , makes the mask the most advanced test facility of its kind in the world			1
' his colleague @entity41 said the new system allows them to mimic the ocean 's most extreme conditions on demand			0
he said : ' in this facility , we can test scale models up to 30 feet in length in order to predict the full - scale performance of ships in the open ocean			1
we are very excited to begin exploring the facility 's new capabilities and integrating them with our existing test equipment			2
' the tank is 360 feet long and 240 feet wide and holds in the region of 12 million gallons of water			1
it is able to test the scale model of ships and moored platforms in all types of sea conditions			2
engineers are able to create specific wave types from all different weather conditions			1
the facility can test models of @entity74 naval vessels and how they will perform in different conditions ( file photo ) speaking to the @entity77 mr @entity24 said : ' there are no freak waves in the world			0
' the computer controlled systems can create sea conditions from dead calm to a typhoon			1
it also has the ability to mimic particular sea conditions from an individual ocean			0
as well as testing the handling characteristics of various ships in all weather conditions			2
the tank can help assess the extreme limits where a ship can launch a missile or if a helicopter can land on deck			0
also , engineers can test the impact of the weight of a vessel and how it handles , whether the warship has a full fuel tank or is almost empty			2
according to @entity77 , in the past , engineers had to bring remote control vessels to the open ocean during particular weather events which was deemed inefficient			0
with the new system , engineers can mimic a six - week cruise in a fraction of the time			2
the system has the ability to test models at speeds of up to 50 knots			0
chief of naval operations admiral @entity117 recently visited the facility to receive a briefing on its capabilities			0
he said : ' technology is moving fast , and some of that technology is being grabbed and put into military systems			0
' addressing personnel at the facility he said : ' what you do here , make no mistake , is a major part of our advantage			0
when i talk to the folks who design and test the technology , what you do is astounding ; it not only is good ship building , but it 's also good ship design			0
' the facility is currently testing the new $ 7billion @entity143 1000 destroyer as well as a new design of submarine .			0

the facility , which was built in 1962 , has undergone a 6 - year - long upgrade
engineers can now create almost any sea condition at the touch of a button
the 360 - foot long tank has 216 individually controlled wave boards
the facility is currently testing the next *generation* of the @entity0 's ships
