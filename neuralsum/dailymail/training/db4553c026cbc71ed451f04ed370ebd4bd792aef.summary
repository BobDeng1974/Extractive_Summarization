by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has been ' non-stop crying ' as he battles the fallout over two damaging video clips that show him making racist comments			1
the troubled teen idol was plunged into a new racism row after a video clip emerged of him changing the lyrics of a song to joke about killing a ‘ n * * * * * ’ and joining the @entity12			1
and today , a source close to the 20 - year - old singer told @entity15 ' @entity2 's been in tears			1
but he knows he needs to take responsibility for his actions , he 's confronting his past and he 's hanging out with his real friends and his parents			2
he apologised , saying : ' facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things i 've ever dealt with			0
' but i feel now that i need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger			0
' at the end of the day , i just need to step up and own what i did			0
' @entity2 's team consider bad influence pals to include rappers @entity50 and @entity51 , both of whom used his @entity55 home as a bolthole and were seen behind the wheel of his sportscars			1
this latest controversy comes after @entity2 apologised ' for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable behaviour ' after another video clip was revealed of him using the n - word five times			1
the source said it was ' almost a relief ' that the video clips had been made public as @entity2 's camp first knew they had been leaked three years ago			1
the clips were bought by @entity29 , who never released them before this week			0
this fresh clip is believed to have been stolen while @entity2 was filming his first movie , @entity74			2
and the source added : ' @entity2 seems to have ditched the problem people around him and he 's trying to pull himself together			1
he 's cleaning himself up			2
' unfortunately your browser does not support @entity80			0
it apparently came about when @entity2 saw a comedian parodying his song online and he then copied the comedian			1
however , @entity29 reports he knew ' almost immediately it was a stupid thing to do ' and confessed to mentor @entity86 and close pal @entity87			0
@entity86 showed him old racist videos to educate him and @entity2 is said to have seen the error of his ways			1
what 's more , @entity29 reports that the @entity93 clan , which features the likes of ' @entity95 and @entity96 – who @entity2 regularly hangs out with – are supporting the never say never hitmaker			1
@entity98 , president of @entity93 , is quoted by the website as saying : ' @entity2 does not have a slave mentality			2
he treats his people with respect			0
' meanwhile , @entity2 has claimed that people have tried to extort him over the two videos which have recently leaked but he ' says he will not be shaken down anymore			1
he says he wants people to see the video and he wants to accept responsibility			2
' the footage of @entity2 telling a racist joke was made public on sunday after he refused to pay $ 1million to the person who had obtained it			1
the singer was held to ransom over the clip , @entity29 has said , by a man who had copied it from a computer hard drive belonging to the singer			0
sources told the website that the star 's reps were contacted two months ago by a lawyer , who represented a client who had worked on the his videos			2
@entity29 states that the lawyer said he 'd sell the video to the media unless @entity2 forked out $ 1million , which was quickly refused			1
the price was allegedly later dropped to $ 800,000 and then $ 500,000			2
but the seller was ' sent packing ' by @entity2 's representatives as they felt the video of him telling a racist joke ' was not that harmful ' because he was only 15 when it was recorded			1
the news emerged on the same day that the hitmaker was spotted boarding a private jet , after a brief stay stay at a swanky villa in @entity26			0
causing a stir : the news emerged as the hitmaker was spotted leaving a swanky villa in @entity26 ' i thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes ' : the 20 - year - old , pictured in the clip , blamed his actions on ignorance , but he insisted he 's learned his lesson on tuesday , @entity151 shared the new clip which shows the @entity154 singer , wearing a dog tag and a dark blue shirt , changing the words to his 2009 song @entity35 in order to use the n - word			1
a source told the newspaper : ‘ unfortunately this is the devastating reality of how @entity2 has behaved and reveals his attitude toward such a deeply emotive subject			1
‘ people need to see this			0
normal kids in society do not make these kind of jokes			0
he is protected by a network of staff , but the camera does n’t lie			0
’ on monday , the @entity1 reported how @entity2 faced a backlash from his fans after the clip of him saying the n - word leaked on @entity29			1
showing him the way : @entity86 took @entity2 aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible in hiding : @entity2 has holed up at this luxury @entity26 villa while he waited for the race row to blow over , it has was revealed company : pals including the @entity188 @entity189 were with @entity2 at the stunning poolside hideaway it is believed that both clips dating back to 2009 are from the same video			1
they will be seen as likely to prove particularly damaging to his career because of the help he has received from @entity198 artists			0
the @entity154 star is signed to @entity200 , the label owned by black singer - songwriter @entity86 , while he has performed with a string of black singers and rappers including @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity95			2

‘ thanks to friends and family i learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologised for those wrongs			0
now that these mistakes from the past have become public i need to apologise again to all those i have offended			0
