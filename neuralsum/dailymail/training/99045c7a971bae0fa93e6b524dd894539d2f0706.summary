by @entity0 @entity1 is facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm too wide for many of its platforms			1
the incredible mistake means that 1300 stations will have to be upgraded so as to accommodate the trains			1
too much too soon : @entity1 's new @entity11 trains are too wide for many existing station platforms ' it 's an outrageous waste of taxpayers ' money , ' said @entity16 , of the @entity18 transport pressure group which campaigns for a better deal for commuters			1
' the mistake is a hugely embarrassing one and it is not the first time that it has happened			0
the bureaucrats responsible are completely out of touch			0
' rail operations ordered the new trains for the country 's regional network – one which traditionally has a reputation for being one of the best in the world			1
but they are too wide to travel through the nation 's stations , a report in the investigative weekly , @entity41 , reveals			2
repair work has so far been carried out on 300 of the platforms that need adjusting , and hundreds more are on a waiting list			0
on average , the trains are 3cms too wide			2
@entity46 , the organisation responsible for rail tracks in @entity1 , has set aside the equivalent of more than £ 45m to deal with the mistake , but the figure is likely to be well above £ 100m once it is finished			2
the error is said to have happened when @entity46 handed over the wrong dimensions to @entity54 , @entity1 's national rail operator			2
speeding forwards : @entity1 's rail network is traditionally viewed as one of the best in the world @entity54 then put in their order for the new trains to a number of engineering companies including @entity64			1
the measurements provided by @entity46 related to platforms built over the past 30 years , but many are far older , and were not built to a standard size			0
@entity46 spokesman @entity69 said : ' we discovered the problem a bit late			1
we recognise that , and we accept responsibility on that score			0
' he said that everything possible would be done to avoid passing over the massive cost of the mistake to the taxpayer			0
@entity1 's minister of transport , @entity81 , said his country 's ' absurd rail system ' was to blame , because it makes a division between track operators @entity46 and @entity54			1
many believe the two groups should merge , so as to avoid similar mistakes in the future			0
decay in @entity1 's ageing regional rail network came into sharp focus last july when a train derailed outside @entity94 , causing seven deaths			1
investigators blamed loose bolts and inadequate safety checks for the disaster , which also saw hundreds of other injured			0
@entity1 is regularly accused of pumping millions into its prestigious high speed tgv system , while ignoring its regional railways .			0

@entity103 faces in @entity94 as new fleet of trains causes transport *headaches*
up to 1300 regional stations will need to be upgraded to fit the *rolling* stock
