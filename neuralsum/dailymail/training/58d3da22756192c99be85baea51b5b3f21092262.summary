by @entity0 this is the touching moment a kindergarten teacher gave a heartwarming graduation address to his first ever class and stunned them by breaking out into song			1
@entity7 began his kindergarten teaching career 13 years ago in 2001 , just two days before the 9/11 attacks			2
his first ever class remained so important to him that he was invited to @entity10 , @entity11 to give the graduation address as some of the students from that group were receiving their diplomas			2
but what the audience did n't expect was for mr @entity7 to break out into song , singing ' @entity33 ' a strangely fitting song for the occasion by @entity36 , which reminds youngsters to ' share everything ' and ' play fair '			1
mr @entity7 starts his speech by recalling how when the children first started at kindergarten 13 years ago , they still tattled on each other , cried and some did n't even listen to direction			2
he also reminisced how some of the children would ' openly pick their noses with an amazing sense of purpose ' much to the delight of the audience			0
during his speech and much to the delight of the audience , mr @entity7 broke out into song giving a rendition of the song ' @entity33 ' but he explained that much of what the graduates would have learned in kindergarten still applies in adult life			1
he said : ' these are just simple truths that remind us all how we should conduct ourselves , whether we are 6 , 16 , or 60			0
remember that little seed in the paper cup ? he accompanied his song with the actions as the graduates gathered clapped and cheered their former teacher ' first the roots grow down and then the plant grows up ? ' mr @entity7 then amazes the audience and starts to sing the ' @entity33 ' song with the graduates gathered clapping and cheering as he breaks into song			0
during the tune he evens demonstrates the actions , by pointing at the audience before inviting them to join in with the last chorus			0
he then finishes the song with a clap in the air , before saying : ' @entity87 bless you all and congratulations ' , while he is applauded and cheered by his former students			0
kindergarten teacher mr @entity7 , singing ' @entity33 ' at the @entity10 graduation ceremony when i was a little kid not so long ago , i had to learn a lot of stuff i did n't even know how to dress myself , tie my shoes , how to jump a rope , how to smile for a picture without looking like a dope but of all the things i learned my favourite of them all , was a little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall , of all you learn here remember this the best , do n't hurt each other and clean up your mess , take a nap everyday , wash before you eat , hold hands , stick together , look before you cross the street , and remember the seed in the little paper cup , first the root goes down and then the plant grows up ! well , it was first , second , third grade , fourth grade , too , where i had to learn the big things the big kids do to add , subtract , and multiply , read and write and play , how to sit in a little uncomfortable desk for nearly half a day but of all they taught me my favorite of them all , was the little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall but lately i 've been worried as i look around and see , an awful lot of grown - ups acting foolish as can be now i know there 's lots of things to know i have n't mastered yet , but it seems there 's real important stuff that grown - ups soon forget so i 'm sure we 'd all be better off if we would just recall , that little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall words and music by @entity36			1
