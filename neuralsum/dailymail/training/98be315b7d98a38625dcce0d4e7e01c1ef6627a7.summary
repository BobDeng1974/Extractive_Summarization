by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 9 october 2013 artist @entity1 , who avoided prison after being found guilty of sex offences against children , was jailed for two years and three months by @entity6 judges today when they ruled that his non-custodial sentence was ' unduly lenient '			1
lord chief justice @entity8 , sitting with two other judges in @entity10 , quashed the suspended sentence imposed in june in the case of @entity1 , 70 , of @entity13 near @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity1 , who was accused of abusing children who posed for his paintings in the 70s and 80s , originally received 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years at @entity20 , but the sentence was referred to appeal judges by attorney general @entity23			1
@entity1 , who was present in court for the hearing , was convicted of six charges of indecency with a child and one allegation of indecent assault relating to three girls as well as the sentence review , the judges also heard a bid by @entity1 , who had denied the charges against him , to challenge his conviction			1
but the court rejected the application for permission to appeal , ruling that the verdicts were ' safe '			1
@entity1 , who was present in court for the hearing , was convicted of six charges of indecency with a child and one allegation of indecent assault relating to three girls			1
lord @entity8 , who said @entity1 had not shown a ' shred of remorse ' for his victims , ruled that the sentence should not have been suspended and the correct total to be imposed today was a term of 27 months			1
@entity1 claimed that his interest in young girls was artistic and not sexual - but that claim was rejected by the three judges			1
lord @entity8 said the girls had ' no understanding of the true purpose ' behind what @entity1 was doing			1
lord @entity8 said @entity1 had shown ' no contrition ' by maintaining that he had done nothing wrong ' there was no doubt that his purpose was sexual			2
there is no doubt that he had a sexual interest in children			0
' when considering the appropriate sentence the court had to have regard to the fact that the only mitigation @entity1 had was his former good character and his age			1
lord @entity8 added that against that ' there are a very large number of aggravating factors '			0
those factors included the ' comparison in age between the victims and his own age at the time the offences were committed ' and the number of victims			0
but the ' most serious ' was the ' very serious abuse of the position of trust ' that he had in relation to the girls			2
his reputation as a landscape artist enabled those who were closest to the children to trust him , said lord @entity8			0
there was also the factor of the ' very serious impact on the victims , magnified by the way in which he had grossly manipulated them and degraded them by the photographs he had taken '			0
lord @entity8 said the court had seen victim impact statements from the three victims in which they described how giving evidence at @entity1 's trial was the worst experience of their lives			1
when suspending the prison term , the sentencing judge said he took into account @entity1 's age , the length of time since the offences , and his ' steep fall from grace and irretrievably tarnished reputation '			1
it was argued on behalf of the attorney general that ' reputational impact ' on him was not a reason for suspending the sentence and it was ' wrong in principle ' to take that into account			0
exceptional circumstances were required for a sentence to be suspended			2
lord @entity8 said @entity1 had shown ' no contrition ' , maintaining that he had done nothing wrong , and that as an artist he seeks to ' capture the innocence of children in a state of grace '			2
he claimed he was the victim of a ' global witch - hunt against artists '			0
@entity1 claimed that his interest in young girls was artistic and not sexual lord @entity8 said : ' he seeks to blame others and asserts a conspiracy against him			2
it is self - evident he has no understanding of the very serious harm he has done to the victims by his serious criminal misconduct			0
' he still asserts that art is being put on trial			0
that is nonsensical bearing in mind the facts			0
' speaking after the hearing , the attorney general said : ' @entity1 committed terrible sexual offences against vulnerable young girls who were in his charge and ought to have felt safe			1
he manipulated them and abused his position of trust			0
' @entity166 agrees that the 12 - month suspended sentence handed to him was unduly lenient , and i am satisfied they have replaced it with 27 months custody			1
' it is right that sexual crimes , whether committed many years ago or more recently , should be punished appropriately			0
' today the court affirmed this and sent a clear message that people who have behaved in this way in the past will face the consequences through the courts			2
' under the early tutelage of the ' godfather of @entity184 ' sir @entity183 , @entity1 embarked on a career which catalogued life on the streets of @entity10 , landscapes of the countryside , and portraiture of children			2
he had been tutored by lord @entity192 and sir @entity193 , with his work displayed across the world including exhibitions at @entity10 's @entity197 , the @entity198 and the @entity199 in @entity200			0
in 1975 he founded the @entity202 movement - artists who had left the city to live in the countryside .			0
