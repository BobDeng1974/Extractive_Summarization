by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity4 's best chance of beating @entity5 is to isolate @entity6 by playing @entity7 as a central striker			1
the @entity10 forward was put out to pasture on the left - hand side during the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity14 on saturday			1
and @entity7 , despite assisting @entity16 's first half equaliser , was heavily criticised back home for not helping @entity18 enough			1
play him through the middle ! @entity7 should start as @entity4 's central striker against @entity5 forthright : @entity2 did n't pull any punches again in his @entity25 online blog neat finish : @entity16 netted @entity4 's equaliser against @entity14 in @entity28 on saturday night @entity2 , writing in his @entity25 blog , stresses that @entity30 should take that problem out of the equation by starting the 28 - year - old up front			1
' @entity7 can destroy @entity6 , if @entity7 is played in his best position , ' he said			2
' but i ’ll say it again , @entity7 has to play up front			1
' @entity38 and @entity39 have repeated it on the @entity41			0
play our best goalscorer in his best position and he ’ll get goals			0
' his record at international level supports that			0
it ’s not rocket science			0
' @entity7 's record at major tournaments is n't befitting a player who has been a lynchpin domestically for so many years ; it 's something he is clearly mindful of himself			2
bit of a problem ? @entity7 was forced to play out wide on the left against the @entity57 get him isolated : @entity2 believes @entity7 will ' destroy ' @entity6 if he plays up front he has been undergoing double sessions in a bid to fine tune match sharpness , and said this week : ' i said from the start i want to do everything i can to make sure i 'm ready for these @entity67 games and as part of that i was doing extra training a week before the squad joined up			1
' that does n't shock @entity2 in the slightest			2
' i ’ve read that @entity7 stayed for extra shooting practice after training with @entity4 on monday			0
it does n’t surprise me , ' he added			0
' that ’s standard @entity7 – he ’d be out all day and you ’d have to drag him in			0

@entity7 was operating from the left against @entity14 in @entity28
@entity2 says @entity7 must play up front
