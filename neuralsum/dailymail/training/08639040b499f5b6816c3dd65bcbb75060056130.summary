captured on a small cine - camera as it plays across the ranks of 17 approaching cannibal war canoes , the image is fleeting but unmistakable			1
among the massed ranks of dark - skinned headhunter tribesmen heading around the bend of a @entity8 river is a naked and bearded white - skinned man , his face partly covered in war paint as he paddles furiously			1
the appearance of a white face among a throng of @entity16 cannibals would be astonishing at the best of times			1
but in the circumstances in which this footage was shot , it is potentially mind - boggling			1
a ' white tribesman ' was seen with a a group of @entity16 cannibals in 1969 , eight years after @entity24 mysteriously disappeared in a similar area for the impressive scene was filmed in 1969 close to the spot where , eight years earlier , a scion of the @entity24 dynasty — the richest , most powerful family in @entity31 history — had gone missing , sparking the biggest hunt ever launched in the @entity33			1
since 23 - year - old @entity24 disappeared during a trip to collect primitive art from one of the remotest corners of the planet , rumours swirled about his fate			1
the official explanation advanced by the former colony ’s @entity43 rulers was that he drowned after he tried to swim to shore from his capsized boat			1
others insisted he met a more horrible fate — killed and eaten by cannibals seeking revenge on white men for a @entity43 attack on their village			2
now , a documentary made by @entity55 , son of actor @entity56 , has thrown the focus on this extraordinary story once more			0
and , tantalisingly , newly unearthed film footage of the mysterious white canoeist suggests an astonishing possibility			2
instead of being killed and eaten , did the @entity62 - educated @entity31 reject his civilised past and join a tribe of cannibals ? the riddle started in 1961 when the young graduate swapped his entitled @entity70 life for the privations of @entity72			1
now part of the @entity79 province of @entity80 , it was one of the wildest , most remote places on @entity74 , populated by people largely stuck in the @entity83			0
a keen anthropologist , @entity24 wanted to supply his father @entity85 — governor of @entity86 and later @entity88 ’s vice-president — with exhibits for a museum of primitive art he had just founded			2
occupying 10,000 square miles of jungle swamp on the southern coast of the @entity43 colony , the @entity93 tribes were ferocious headhunters , but they also made stunning wooden sculptures ( rubbed with the blood of those they killed ) as well as hauntingly beautiful decorated skulls			0
these they collected from tribal foes , having eaten their brains in a sacred ritual they believed would give them the dead men ’s power			2
their bloodthirsty way of life revolved around endless revenge attacks against neighbouring villages			0
each time a tribe member was killed , he had to be avenged by taking the skull of an enemy — whether man , woman or child			2
mystery : @entity24 was never seen again after attempting to swim to shore after his boat capsized whites were generally safe from this tribal war , and @entity24 spent six months there , writing home about the amazing art he had acquired and his fascination with @entity93 culture			1
his father later said his restless son had never been happier			0
but things were about to change for ever			0
on november 17 , 1961 , @entity24 was travelling up the coast — a region of dense rainforest , mangrove swamp and crocodile - infested mudflats known as the @entity140 — when his small catamaran capsized in rough seas			1
two teenage native guides immediately swam towards shore — around nine miles — to get help			2
following a very uncomfortable night spent clinging to the submerged craft , an impatient @entity24 stripped to his underpants , strapped together two jerry cans for buoyancy and struck out for land , telling his companion , a @entity43 anthropologist : ‘ i think i can make it			2
’ they were the last words he is known to have uttered			0
the @entity43 was picked up the next day , but his companion was never seen again			0
his father chartered a @entity156 and flew a media army out to the region			0
thousands of locals joined a search involving dozens of ships , planes and helicopters			0
but no trace was ever found , and after ten days his devastated father gave up			0
@entity43 officials presumed that @entity24 had drowned			1
but he had been a strong swimmer , the sea was calm , the tide was pushing him to shore and the local sharks were n’t man - eaters			1
rumours persisted that he had reached land			0
then , in 1968 , @entity86 magazine editor @entity173 flew out to @entity80 and launched a months - long search			0
he discovered a retired @entity43 missionary , @entity175 , who had been living in the @entity93 area when @entity24 disappeared			2
the priest told @entity173 an extraordinary story : a week after the last searchers gave up , he started hearing tribal rumours that the @entity31 had been caught and killed			0
the reason , he claimed , was that three years before @entity24 disappeared , a @entity43 police patrol had come to a village called @entity184 to sort out a tribal headhunting war			2
fearing they were about to be attacked , the police opened fire , killing five village leaders			0
by their sacred code , the tribe had to have revenge and take a head — a white man ’s head like that of the patrol ’s @entity43 leader			1
that was easier said than done			0
then , one day , a group of some 50 @entity201 men were returning home from a trading trip when they finally got their chance : a white man , exhausted and unarmed , swam towards their canoes just offshore			1
one of the tribesmen was said to have stabbed him fatally with a 10ft fishing spear , before they hauled him into a boat and took him to shore , where they chopped him up , cooked him and ate him			2
the priest said the tribesmen admitted they had killed him as revenge for the police raid			0
@entity43 officials disputed the story , saying that missionaries were unreliable			0
besides , sneered one sceptic , an even more bizarre story had leaked out , that @entity24 was still alive , and ‘ kept as a white idol by a tribe near the coast ’			1
so what was the truth ? the official explanation is that @entity24 drowned , while some say he made it to shore only to be killed and eaten by the cannibal tribe last year , a new book revealed that two @entity43 missionaries had sent detailed reports of the murder to the colonial government and the @entity235 , even identifying which headhunter had kept parts of the @entity31 ’s skeleton			1
though magazine editor @entity173 favoured the theory that @entity24 had been killed and eaten , he did n’t dismiss the possibility he had survived			1
@entity243 men were regarded as wielders of powerful magic by @entity33 tribesmen			0
when the @entity247 left the region after @entity250 ’s 1945 surrender and stopped dropping air supplies — or cargo — so - called ‘ cargo cults ’ sprung up on islands such as @entity16 and @entity255			1
the tribes venerated the @entity258 goods — including canned food , mass - produced clothing , weapons and medicine — that had so drastically altered their lives , and built mock landing strips and lit signal fires in the expectation the @entity268 would return			0
the son of an immensely powerful white man could have made a strong magic totem for any tribe if he conveyed to them who he was			1
could the story about @entity24 ’s murder have been a cover - up , hiding an even more extraordinary fate ? @entity173 did n’t have a permit to travel in the @entity280 region , so he sent photographer @entity281			1
it was @entity281 who shot the footage of the white - skinned canoeist , but then @entity173 allowed it to languish for more than 40 years in an @entity31 warehouse , until documentary - maker @entity55 found it			1
@entity56 ’s documentary is called @entity291			0
he was researching a screenplay based on @entity173 ’s book about @entity24 ’s disappearance when he found around 15 reels of uncut film and sound tapes			1
it is not clear why it had been gathering dust in a @entity302 vault , but it is believed @entity173 ( who died in 2004 ) felt he did n’t have enough footage for a documentary			0
@entity281 told me yesterday that he did not believe the mystery man was @entity24 , though he had n’t noticed him at the time			1
‘ i ca n’t say i was particularly aware of a light - skinned figure in one of the canoes , but i do recall coming across a reference to an albino male when i glanced through my journal a few weeks ago , ’ he said			0
while he , too , favours the cannibal theory , @entity55 is not so sure that the white canoeist can be automatically dismissed			2
‘ this shot of a bearded , light - skinned @entity322 paddling in a canoe full of naked @entity93 warriors begs more questions than it answers , ’ he says in his documentary , noting that the @entity93 do n’t wear beards			0
‘ the resemblance to @entity24 , an accomplished canoeist who wore a beard , is obvious			2
’ and if it was n’t @entity24 — ‘ assimilated into the @entity93 ’s cannibal culture in the preceding seven years ’ , as @entity56 suggests — who was it ? in this outlandish tale , where anything seems possible , it is not an unreasonable question .			1

@entity24 went missing in @entity16 back in 1961
he *'s* said to have drowned after trying to swim to shore from capsized boat
but footage from 1969 shows a white man canoeing with a cannibal tribe
pictures may prove that @entity24 survived and *shunned* family dynasty to join @entity16 man - eaters
sceptics say if the cannibal tribe found him , they would have eaten him
