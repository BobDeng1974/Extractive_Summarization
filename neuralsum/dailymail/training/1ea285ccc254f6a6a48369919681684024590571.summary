it 's like the opening gambit of a bad @entity3 romance			2
a @entity5 town populated only by women has made an appeal for eligible bachelors			1
more than 600 women live in the town of @entity11 do @entity12 , south - east @entity5			1
and most of them are aged between 20 and 35 years old			1
now they have extended an invitation to potential suitors			1
but do n't start packing your bags just yet - any men who go have to understand that this corner of the @entity5 countryside is very much a woman 's world			2
@entity24 : this image from @entity28 do @entity12 's @entity26 page shows two of the town 's residents at a party			1
they have made an appeal for eligible suitors to woo some of their dozens of available young women @entity38 : more than 600 women live in the town of @entity11 do @entity12 , in a rural part of south - east @entity5 sisters are doing it for themselves : their husbands and adult sons work away from home all week long some of @entity12 's women are already married and have families , but their husbands - and any sons over 18 - are made to work away from home and only allowed to return at the weekends			1
it means girl power rules in the rural community , with women in charge of every aspect of life - from farming to town planning and even religion			1
and residents say their town is that much the better for it			0
' there are lots of things that women do better than men			1
our town is prettier , more organised , and far more harmonious than if men were in charge , ' said @entity72 , 49			0
' when problems or disputes arise , we resolve them in a woman 's way , trying to find consensus rather than conflict			0
' we share everything , even the land we work on			1
nobody competes with anyone here			0
it 's all for one , and one for all			0
' the whole town came together recently to help buy a huge widescreen tv for our community centre so we can all watch soap operas together			0
' and there 's always time to stop and gossip , try on each other 's clothes and do each other 's hair and nails			0
' farmer @entity98 : women are in charge of every aspect of life in the town , from farming to town planning ' there 's always time to stop and gossip ' : the town 's residents say life there is much better without men but while none of the residents of @entity11 do @entity12 would have it any other way , it has left them with just one problem			1
@entity117 , 23 , admits it 's impossible for her neighbours - renowned in the region as strikingly beautiful - to find a would - be spouse			0
' here , the only men we single girls meet are either married or related to us , everyone is a cousin			2
i have n't kissed a man for a long time , ' she said			0
' we all dream of falling in love and getting married			2
but we like living here and do n't want to have to leave the town to find a husband			0
' ' we all dream of falling in love ' : however their rules have made it difficult for single women to find husbands ' but men need to live according to our rules ' : and the women of @entity28 do @entity12 are n't interested in leaving the lack of eligible batchelors has now led the community 's many single young ladies for make an appeal for interested men - but only those willing to adapt to living in a women 's world			1
ms @entity72 said : ' we 'd like to get to know men who would leave their own lives and come to be a part of ours			0
' but first they need to agree to do what we say and live according to our rules			2
' @entity157 do @entity12 was born in the hills near @entity159 , in @entity161 state , after founder @entity162 was branded an adulterer after leaving a man she had been forced to marry			1
she was chased out of town in 1891 after the @entity166 excommunicated her and the next five generations of her family when she shacked up with another suitor			0
shunned by the local population , she and other women who subsequently went to live with them were vilified as loose women and prostitutes , causing them to isolate themselves from the outside world			1
free : the women of @entity28 do @entity12 have dispensed with patriarchal @entity176 , with one saying ' we do n't need to go to church , get married in front of a priest or baptise our children			1
these are rules made up by men in 1940 , an evangelical pastor , @entity184 , took one of the women , aged 16 , to be his wife and founded a church in the growing community			2
however , he proceeded to impose strict puritanical rules , banning them from drinking alcohol , listening to music , cutting their hair or using any type of contraceptive			0
when @entity184 died in 1995 , the women decided never again to let a man dictate how they should live			1
and one of the first things they did was to dismantle the male - biased organised religion he had set up			0
@entity72 said : ' we have @entity205 in our hearts			0
but we do n't think we need to go to church , get married in front of a priest or baptise our children			2
these are rules made up by men			0

@entity157 do @entity12 is home to more than 600 women , most of them under 35
some are already married but their husbands must live and work elsewhere
but that means there is a *shortage* of eligible suitors to woo young women
