by @entity0 business secretary @entity1 tonight attacked the ' utterly reprehensible ' behaviour of his close friend lord @entity3 - after it emerged he had paid for a poll that showed @entity5 was doomed to election defeat			1
mr @entity1 said his friend 's bid to topple the deputy prime minister in the wake of the party 's @entity12 and local elections disaster was ' totally inexcusable '			1
the @entity16 cabinet minister 's decision to name @entity17 as the source of the damning research came as mr @entity5 was left pleading with his party not to sack @entity21 tonight insisted there was ' no leadership issue ' as far as he was concerned			1
the pair go on holidays together , but mr @entity1 insisted the @entity16 peer was not his spokesman @entity5 faced growing criticism over his leadership today following last week 's disastrous showing at the @entity12 and local elections the dramatic development came after pollsters @entity38 released the new survey revealing that mr @entity5 could lose his own seat at the general election			1
it showed that if an election was held now , mr @entity5 would finish third in his constituency - behind @entity45 and the @entity46			1
more than half of mr @entity5 's constituents thought he was doing a bad or ' very bad ' job as deputy prime minister - while around 45 % said he was a bad local mp			1
meanwhile , almost one in three voters in @entity53 did not even know mr @entity5 was their mp , the poll found			2
the poll sparked fury among mr @entity5 's allies who suspected @entity17 had commissioned the study to topple the deputy prime minister and replace him with mr @entity1			1
but the business secretary released a statement tonight denying that @entity17 spoke for him			1
he said : ' @entity17 's actions are totally inexcusable and unacceptable			2
i have made it very clear repeatedly that he does not speak or act for me			0
' commissioning and publishing polls without the consent of the member of parliament , as in the case of @entity53 , is utterly reprehensible			0
' there are undoubtedly raw feelings in the wake of poor local and @entity12 election results			2
we need to respond in a measured way			0
' public speculation about the leadership is an unwelcome distraction and as i made absolutely clear yesterday there is no leadership issue as far as i 'm concerned			0
' the deputy prime minister appeared more relaxed and happy than yesterday as he played pool with 16 and 17 - year - olds at a training centre at @entity87 , in central @entity88 this morning mr @entity1 's bombshell statement came after mr @entity5 pleaded with @entity90 not to ' lose their nerve ' and get rid of him			1
the deputy prime minister admitted he had lost the argument over @entity12 and immigration with @entity95 , in the wake of last week 's disastrous @entity12 and local election results			1
but the @entity16 leader insisted he would not quit			0
he said he wanted to ' finish the job ' and dismissed calls to dissolve the coalition or shift the party 's approach to @entity12			2
asked this morning if he was prepared to stand down , mr @entity5 said : ' look , i think if i felt or indeed if the whole party felt that changing strategy , changing leaders , pulling out of the coalition , which is what a number of these individuals advocate , would deal with the challenge which the party faces , because of course we face challenges - that 's obviously daft to suggest otherwise - then i would n't hesitate to advocate it			1
' but i think it 's so important that particularly at a time when our big judgments as a party over the last few years , difficult years they 've been politically , are now being vindicated in terms of delivering the economic recovery that we came to this government to deliver , delivering all the things that we 've been campaigning on for years			2
' i think that 's not the time to start turning inwards when we of course as a party , as a campaigning party should be talking to the @entity131 people about what we want to do in the future			2
' asked later what he would do to win back voters , mr @entity5 reaffirmed his commitment to the @entity137 and said it was the ' wrong time to lose our nerve '			1
he said : ' i do n't think pulling out of the @entity137 is the answer			0
we said back in 2010 very , very clearly that we were making a five - year commitment			0
' we knew it was going to be tough , not only tough of course entering into a coalition in the first place , but also doing the very downright difficult and controversial things that we needed to do to fix the economy			0
' but i think a year out before a general election , exactly at the point , as i say , when those big judgments are proving their worth , would be the wrong time to lose our nerve			1
' he added : ' i think it 's very important that we see that through because otherwise , of course , a lot of people will conclude that somehow the @entity16 are only comfortable in opposition			0
' mr @entity5 was bombarded with questions from reporters when leaving his home in @entity88 this morning asked if he had lost the argument on @entity12 , mr @entity5 said : ' i totally accept , of course , the verdict of voters last week that we did not win the case that i was putting and my party was putting			1
' but he added : ' the argument has now started and i hope and believe over time it will be won			0
' mr @entity5 received support from unlikely sources yesterday - as @entity174 and @entity175 threw their weight behind him			2
this morning @entity177 made clear mr @entity175 wanted the @entity28 to stay on			0
meanwhile , former pm @entity174 said he admired the ' leadership and courage ' the @entity16 leader had shown in power			2
the backing came with mr @entity5 under intense pressure after his party lost hundreds of councillors and 11 of its 12 @entity186			1
he has received public support from senior @entity16 colleagues , but a number of mps and activists have broken cover to warn he is ' toxic ' for voters and must go			0
a spokeswoman for the prime minister was repeatedly asked about mr @entity5 's position at a briefing for journalists this morning			2
she said : ' this is a strong coalition that is pursuing its long term economic plan			0
' pressed on whether that meant mr @entity175 wanted his deputy to remain in place , the spokeswoman replied : " i think i have said that ... ' i 've been clear the pm is intent on working with the coalition , with the deputy prime minister to secure the economic recovery and to keep improving the situation for @entity131 's hard - working families			1
' he 's focused on working with the deputy prime minister as part of the coalition to deliver on the government 's plans			0
' @entity95 was congratulated during a meeting of the leaders of @entity222 political groups in @entity223 today quizzed on whether mr @entity175 could work with anyone else if mr @entity5 was overthrown , the spokeswoman said : ' i have not seen anything from either the pm or deputy pm to suggest that is happening , and they are very much focused on working together and continuing with the achievements that the coalition has made			1
' mr @entity174 told the @entity233 4 today programme that he did not think the @entity16 ' decision to campaign in the @entity12 election as the ' party of in ' had been their main problem			0
he said : ' to be fair to @entity5 - and i do n't want to damage him by saying this - i think over the past few years he has shown quite a lot of leadership and courage			1
' the problem they have is nothing to do with @entity12			0
the problem they have is very simple			0
they fought the 2010 election on a platform significantly to the left of @entity45 and then ended up in a conservative government with a platform significantly to the right of @entity45			0
there 's not really a cure for that			0
