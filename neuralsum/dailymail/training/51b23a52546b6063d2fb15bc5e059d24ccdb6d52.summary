' not only do you have to be intelligent and articulate , but you also have to be attractive			1
' among the comments that she cites as examples are statements like : ' i 'd still totally do her , ' and ' perhaps you should consider wearing slightly racier clothing ? ' indeed , many are personal attacks on her appearance			1
' i ca n't stop looking at her nose			1
it kind of makes her look like a nerdy pig ' ' she just needs some sexier glasses , ' reads one			2
' i ca n't stop looking at her nose			2
it kind of makes her look like a nerdy pig			2
' another observes : ' she is really cute , but as if she made herself unattractive on purpose ? she could easily keep us focused by changing her clothes			2
i would really like to see her again with the new looks			2
' others take aim at the fact that she is a woman in science , assuming that the brains behind the operation are male			1
calling for change : ms @entity7 said that there is widespread apathy when it comes to such comments , largely because people do n't know what to do about them ' you 'd think this was a man 's job , not two beautiful ladies , ' one said			1
' thumbs up for the @entity77 reference			2
i assume that was written by @entity81			2
' [ @entity81 : ' that was not written by me			0

' while there are at least 13 stem channels hosted by men with more than 400,000 subscribers , and seven of those 13 that have topped a million , there are only four channels hosted by women that have more than 160,000			0
none of us have more than a million , ' she said			0
she adds that while this is not a numbers game , and that the male bloggers deserve their success , this sexist reaction could be part of the reason that women do n't persevere when faced with it			0

' this could be a deterrent for both men and women , but i feel women are going to give up more easily			0
' she says women in her field have a fear of the feedback from subscribers and commenters because one becomes concerned that the audience is more focused on their appearance than the quality of content			1
' even more than that , we are not convinced that the content has to be good or factual because we 're not convinced that people are watching for the content in the first place , ' she continues			0

help us make it widely - known that this kind of apathetic attitude is detrimental and unacceptable			0
