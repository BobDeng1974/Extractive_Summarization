by @entity0 published : 14:30 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 21 march 2013 the editor of the @entity2 issued a grovelling apology last night after the newspaper published details of the budget before @entity7 stood up to deliver it			1
@entity9 said she was ‘ devastated ’ by the error , which resulted in a photograph of the newspaper ’s front page story on the budget being published on @entity15 while mps were still waiting for the chancellor to begin			1
she said a ‘ very young and inexperienced ’ journalist had been suspended while the newspaper carried out a full investigation			2
front page : while chancellor @entity7 was on his feet delivering the @entity25 , the @entity23 front bench were closely studying photocopies of the @entity2 splash which had been tweeted ‘ we have immediately reviewed our procedures , ’ she said			1
‘ we are devastated that an embargo was breached and offer our heartfelt apologies			0
’ a @entity34 source acknowledged the episode had led to the early release of ‘ market sensitive ’ information on growth and borrowing forecasts			0
city traders and financial speculators could potentially have used the early sight of the figures to profit and any misuse would be difficult to prove			0
commons speaker @entity46 told @entity16 today that he had accepted the apologies of the @entity2 for breaking an embargo on the @entity14 but would be asking the chancellor to investigate why the briefing happened			1
mr @entity46 said he would take no further action against the newspaper after editor @entity9 and political editor @entity53 apologised after the @entity56 paper 's front page , featuring details of the @entity14 , was tweeted before @entity7 stood up in the @entity58 yesterday			1
but the speaker said the bigger problem was the ' prior briefing ' to the newspaper			0
making a brief statement in the @entity58 , mr @entity46 said : ' the @entity2 yesterday published the main points of the budget before the @entity66 was informed of them by the chancellor			1
' i have received formal apologies from the editor and from the political editor of the @entity2			1
they have also apologised separately to the @entity73 ( @entity74 )			0
' i shall place those communications in the library			0
their error was extremely regrettable but i am minded not to take that matter further			0
' however , the error would not have occurred had the newspaper not been in possession of prior detailed information about the @entity14			0
' this pre-briefing of @entity14 proposals is a matter of concern to me and , i judge , to the @entity66 as well			0
' i am therefore writing to the chancellor of the exchequer to ask him to set out what happened on this occasion and whether this is a practice of the @entity34			2
' i will revert to the @entity66 as necessary			0
' apology : editor @entity9 said the newspaper was ' devastated that an embargo was breached ' ' so sorry ' : political editor @entity53 apologised after details of @entity14 were published on @entity15 before the chancellor delivered his speech to mps it also led to embarrassment for mr @entity7 , as shadow chancellor @entity101 taunted him in the chamber by waving a copy of the @entity2 ’s front page – which revealed dire public borrowing and growth forecasts – while he delivered his speech			1
labour leader @entity107 demanded an investigation and said mr @entity7 ‘ almost need not have bothered coming ’ to the @entity58 ‘ because the whole budget , including the market - sensitive fiscal forecasts , were in the @entity2 ’			1
@entity113 leaks are treated as a very serious issue at @entity115			0
in 1947 @entity23 chancellor @entity116 resigned after inadvertently leaking details of his own budget to a newspaper			1
in 1936 , cabinet minister @entity119 was forced to resign after an inquiry found he had leaked @entity14 details to a fellow mp and a business associate for personal gain			0
the @entity2 , along with the major broadcasters , traditionally receives a privileged early briefing on the @entity14 to allow it to prepare its first edition , which goes to press while the chancellor is on his feet			1
the details are released under a strict embargo which means they can not be published before they are announced by the chancellor			2
sources at the paper stressed the incident was not technically a ‘ leak ’ but the breach of an embargo			2
the release of a picture of the @entity2 ’s front page included the fact that this year ’s growth target had been halved			1
the newspaper ’s political editor , @entity53 , also issued an apology during the chancellor ’s speech			0
the @entity34 is now likely to face questions from @entity16 over the level of detail pre-briefed to the media under embargo			0
@entity158 ’s former spin doctor @entity157 last night said @entity34 officials appeared to have given the @entity2 far too much information and were not ‘ entirely innocent ’			2
he said normal procedure had been to tell the @entity2 only the broad themes of the budget before the chancellor stood up in the @entity58			1
mr @entity7 last night asked for a review of the practice of pre-briefing the media under embargo .			2

chancellor @entity7 was on his feet delivering the @entity25
but @entity23 **member*s* were already studying @entity2 splash from @entity15
