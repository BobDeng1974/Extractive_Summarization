parents are increasingly using access to computers as a way of controlling their children 's behaviour , with limits on tablets and the internet acting as as a punishment or reward ( file photo ) and it suggests @entity36 , kindles and smartphones have become important bargaining chips in family negotiations			1
the researchers said : ‘ parents like tablets because they are controllable - a tablet can be given or taken away to reflect good or bad behaviour , in a way that is not possible with a conventional television set or computer			2
‘ apps can be purchased as rewards , and , with the growing use of tablets in primary schools , there are strong perceived educational advantages			0
’ however , research director @entity56 said tablet computers are particularly likely to be seen as the young person 's personal possession , making the arguments about restrictions even more difficult			1

the study shows that among the youngest group , five to seven year olds , one in three have their own tablet computer , with two in five going online every day for an average of more than an hour			0
among older children , in the 13 to 16 year old group , internet use is even more widespread , averaging two and a half hours a day , with @entity103 the most widely used website			0
