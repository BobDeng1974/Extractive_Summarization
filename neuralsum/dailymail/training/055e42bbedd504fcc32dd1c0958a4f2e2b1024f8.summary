@entity1 captain @entity0 has lined up former @entity3 manager @entity2 to speak at the team dinner at @entity5 on tuesday evening			1
@entity2 is a friend of assistant captain @entity6 , and turned up to watch the @entity1 team practice on tuesday morning			1
his presence continues a recent tradition of star performers from other sports saying a few words in the team room			2
four years ago it was @entity16 rugby legend @entity15 while @entity18 coach @entity17 spoke at @entity19 last time			0
@entity0 said last week that he had lined up someone of similar stature and @entity2 certainly fits the bill			1
he has turned up at a number of @entity25 events on the @entity26 over the years and is believed to play to a handicap of 18			2
the @entity1 team showed togetherness and high spirits on tuesday as they gathered in a huddle after a photocall @entity33 enjoys a moment to himself in his @entity1 gear ; the @entity36 made his debut in the @entity38 in 1997 it 's all fun and games at the first practice round on tuesday as @entity42 pulls the ears of @entity44 with @entity45 ( left ) looking on @entity2 arrives at @entity5 ahead of giving a motivational speech to the @entity1 @entity38 team on tuesday evening former @entity3 manager @entity2 , a big golfing fan , will seek to get the @entity1 team geed up before play begins on friday the former @entity52 and @entity3 manager plays golf during a pre-season tour of @entity55 back in 2012 sir @entity2 , taking part in a charity golf tournament at @entity58 in @entity59 in 2011 @entity60 @entity44 jokingly gives his friends from the @entity63 team a gesture as he sets up to practice on tuesday @entity44 then has a chuckle to himself and carries on hitting balls after jokingly giving the ' friendly ' wave to his rivals where were you when they took the decision to cancel the 2001 @entity38 ? i was in a small @entity75 outpost that had a @entity76 , a nine - hole golf course , a @entity78 and ... er , that was about it			1
we had been diverted there on september 11			0
for five days we walked the course , wandered the supermarket and gathered each evening in the hotel bar where the @entity86 - based flight crew sang karaoke songs about their home town against the backdrop of those sad , horrific images of 9/11 playing out on the television			2
some good came out of it from a golf point of view			0
when the match was played the following year , it ushered in an era of respectfulness that has been a feature of every @entity38 since			2
' he 's a guy that i played with in the @entity101 pro-am about 15 years ago and that i 've seen now and again over that time , and when i became captain i asked him , ' @entity0 said of @entity2			1
' of course he was more than willing to help			0
but the one thing he asked me to do was keep it really quiet			0
walking around ( the course ) is not keeping it quiet , is it ? we wanted a bit of a surprise for the players but i guess it 's not a surprise			2
' @entity113 fan @entity0 joked that @entity2 would not be giving any of his team the famous ' hairdryer ' treatment , with the @entity113 coincidentally making the trip to @entity118 on saturday			1
' although i 'm a @entity113 fan , i 've always loved the way his teams played and there 's a number of things that he 's dealing with that he was particularly good at that i think he 'll be a particularly strong fit , ' @entity0 added			2
' he 's asked me a lot of questions and i know he 's very keen and looking forward to tonight			0
he 's a big fan of golf , as we know			0
he knows @entity129 ( @entity130 ) very well and @entity129 is a big @entity3 fan			1
not everybody in the room is a @entity3 fan , so that should be a bit fun			2
' this is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them			0
he 's very aware of that			0
there will be questions coming back at him			0
' they all love football and a chance to spend a bit of time with one of the greats in soccer does n't come around very often , particularly with somebody they all admire			0
in my dealings with him , he 's been absolutely fantastic and i know he 'll be great with the players			0
' @entity130 and @entity42 were kept apart on tuesday as @entity1 's players prepared for their first official practice rounds			1
sir @entity2 will speak to the @entity1 @entity38 team at a dinner at @entity5 on tuesday for motivational purposes @entity162 attended the @entity164 and @entity163 for national coaches in @entity166 last week the @entity168 team pose for team photograph prior to the start of the first practice round on tuesday morning @entity1 are looking for their third straight success over @entity63 , having won dramatically at @entity19 in 2012 and at @entity174 in 2010 the @entity1 team huddle together as the press gather round ; spirits seemed high on tuesday morning ahead of the 40th @entity38 @entity130 , @entity178 , @entity33 , @entity44 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity1 team captain @entity0 , @entity45 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity42 and @entity184 form the @entity1 team looking for a third straight success @entity1 team captain @entity0 wipes his eyes with the famous @entity38 trophy in his grasp ; his 10 - foot putt in 2002 won the trophy at the @entity193 the @entity1 team gathered for a photocall on tuesday morning , and spirits seemed high ahead of the showdown in @entity25			1
