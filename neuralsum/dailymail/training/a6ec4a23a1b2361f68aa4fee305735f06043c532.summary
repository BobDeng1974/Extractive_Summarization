an @entity1 terrorist has stopped @entity2 deporting him – by refusing to give his name for 21 years			0
a judge ruled that the @entity5 is a ‘ trusted and senior ’ member of a violent terrorist group and has helped suspects abroad			1
but his lawyers have used human rights laws to prevent the government from throwing him out of this country			1
officials can not draw up crucial paperwork guaranteeing his safety without knowing his true identity			1
pictured is the @entity23 of @entity24 meanwhile , taxpayers have been left to pick up the multi-million pound bill for his legal aid and months of @entity30 hospital care			0
astonishingly , the terrorist , known only as b , is free to walk the streets because his bail conditions were ‘ relaxed ’ to allow him to go swimming and worship at a mosque			0
the legal stand - off provoked a furious response from a senior @entity40 who branded human rights laws ‘ a farce			1
’ @entity44 , mp for @entity45 and @entity46 , said : ‘ it is a damning indictment of the human rights farce in this country that this man has been able to run rings around the deportation system			1
' damning ' : conservative mp @entity44 ‘ if a dangerous criminal or suspected terrorist can frustrate deportation , by spewing out human rights objections while refusing to give his name so the claims can be checked , it turns the system on its head			1
‘ even the human rights lawyers should be embarrassed , it ’s so ridiculous			1
’ the saga emerged in a recent court ruling when @entity32 tried to halt deportation proceedings			0
but judges struck out his appeal			0
his lawyers had said the failure to resolve the stand - off was a breach of his human right to an ‘ effective remedy ’ by the @entity78 to his legal limbo			1
but the judges criticised the failure of the mystery man to identify himself as a ‘ deliberate distortion of the evidence ’			2
they said his ‘ manipulation of information , his contempt and abuse of process ’ must not succeed because it would encourage others to ‘ behave in a similar way ’			0
the terrorist arrived illegally in @entity2 in 1993			0
the @entity95 found he bought a satellite phone and airtime for extremists in @entity5 and @entity99 in 2000			1
the terrorist originally gave his name as @entity102 , later claiming to be @entity103			0
he then refused to identify himself , as his lawyers cited two sections of the @entity107			2
they said revealing who he is would put his family in @entity5 in danger , a breach of article eight , and he could be at risk of torture , a breach of article three			1
in response , the government spent huge sums trying to independently establish his identity with a global investigation			0
his fingerprints and dna were taken but the @entity5 authorities , as well as international counter-terrorism agencies , were unable to find a match			2
an @entity5 language expert was employed to study his speech to pinpoint where he was from			2
officials were even sent to @entity134 to speak to a fellow @entity5 whose identity he stole after obtaining his passport			1
but no progress has been made			0
one source close to the case said : ‘ he has admitted the name he was using is not his real name and the @entity5 confirmed this			2
‘ because of this the government can not obtain the individual assurances needed to secure his removal			0
it is not possible to deport him without these assurances because of our international human rights obligations			1
’ the terrorist is now on bail , with a nine - hour curfew and is banned from leaving a defined area without giving prior notice			0
he is also banned from meeting a list of named associates , using his mobile phone or accessing the internet			0
a @entity165 spokesman said : ‘ we continue to pursue every avenue to ensure this dangerous man is removed from the @entity2			2

judge ruled @entity5 man is ' trusted and senior ' member of violent group
but lawyers used human rights laws to stop him being thrown out
officials ca *n't* draw up official paperwork without his true name
