by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 artist has recreated the movement of @entity6 artists in a series of surreal animations designed to show exactly how they move			1
athletes including @entity11 , @entity12 and gymnast @entity13 were transformed into a series of flowing animations			0
the performances were captured in @entity16 then recreated electronically , substituting abstract lines and curves for the athlete 's body			1
camera motions and playback speed of the footage were also captured , and the movements of the athletes were recreated frame by frame			1
this allowed the artist to easily replace the athletes body with abstract shapes			1
the specific character of each sport is reflected in the visual language and the illustration of its motions @entity3 motion designer @entity46 created the project for his thesis			0
' my thesis , the experimental animation ' @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ' ( @entity53 for ' @entity54 ' - the @entity6 motto ) explores the interplay of abstract shapes and motions			0
' how can the substance of motion be visualized			0
' what degree of abstraction allows a communication with the viewer , ' @entity46 said			0
the movements of famous olympians were digitised using @entity16 motion tracking and rotoscoping of original footage of @entity6 competitions			1
this allowed every movement , including limbs and even fingers , to be captured			2
spot the difference : this animation shows @entity11 swimming during his @entity6 swim camera motions and playback speed of the footage were also captured , and the movements of the athletes were recreated frame by frame			2
this allowed the artist to easily replace the athletes body with abstract shapes			2
' the specific character of each sport is reflected in the visual language and the illustration of its motions , ' @entity46 claims			0
@entity11 just after making a turn in the pool : athletes had their motion 3d captured the turned into abstract artwork @entity12 running the 100m @entity13 's gynmastic routine was reimagined as a series of lines and triangles			1

*researchers* tracked the movement of swimmers and gymnasts and used them to create surreal artworks
performances were captured in @entity16 then recreated , substituting abstract lines and curves for the athlete 's body
