two soldiers , one a @entity2 guard , walked free from court yesterday despite inflicting a shocking beating on a helpless civilian			1
during the drunken attack , which was caught on @entity7 , @entity9 guard @entity8 , 25 , can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim ’s head			1
his fellow soldier , @entity15 @entity14 , 22 , rained blows with his fists on to the man ’s body			1
@entity8 ( left ) , was described as an ' angel ' in court by his officer the soldiers were expected to be jailed for the ‘ deeply unpleasant and inexcusable ’ assault			1
but yesterday a judge at @entity36 made what even he admitted was an ‘ extraordinary ’ decision to let the men walk free			2
judge @entity40 , @entity41 , said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the @entity44 was keen to keep them			0
‘ i state in open court that what i have done is entirely exceptional , ’ he said			2
‘ i ca n’t say what the @entity44 will do but i simply express the hope , as your commanding officers have expressed , that the @entity44 feels able to keep you			0
’ the furious victim @entity53 – who was left with the imprint of @entity8 ’s shoe on his forehead – said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened			1
‘ there was absolutely no reason for the attack , ’ he said			2
‘ to stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong			0
with one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at @entity76 in @entity77 reaching for his neck , @entity14 tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road after dragging the man onto the ground @entity14 is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face the pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them			1
a judge rejected their version of events , saying the man seen in the footage ( above ) posed ' no threat ' when they were beating him ‘ i do n’t know how i escaped that without really serious injuries , the force they used could have killed me and i really expected them to go to jail for it			0
’ both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm			0
@entity8 was given a 12 - month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work			1
@entity14 was given a 12 - month community order , and both men were each told to pay £ 1,000 compensation			1
the maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the @entity119 's sentencing guidelines			2
with both @entity8 and @entity14 found guilty of two counts each , the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years			1
instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as ' exceptional '			0
in the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised			0
@entity8 was given a 12 month sentence suspended , while @entity14 received a 12 - month community order			1
the pair launched the vicious attack after a night ’s heavy drinking near @entity76 in @entity77 last april			2
they matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots			0
they encountered local men mr @entity53 , 25 , and his friend @entity143 after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words			0
@entity14 and @entity8 claimed the two men had threatened to stab them – a claim strongly denied by mr @entity53 , a chef			1
the court was shown video of @entity14 knocking mr @entity143 out cold with a single punch before he and @entity8 set upon mr @entity53			1
their victim runs across a road , trips and falls			2
@entity8 , who has a hood covering his face , can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim ’s head while @entity14 relentlessly pummels mr @entity53 ’s body			1
the pair then ran off and hid in a stream , but were caught by the police			0
mr @entity53 had severe bruising to his face			0
@entity14 is highly regarded by the @entity15 and has been entrusted to stand guard at both @entity2 and @entity168 since the incident			1
he is likely to keep his job			0
@entity171 was also of previous good character			0
@entity173 , defending him , said : ‘ but for that night this man is an angel , but on that night he was a devil			0
’ captain @entity177 said @entity8 had ‘ picked himself up ’ since and ‘ is proving to be one of the best performing people in his platoon ’			2
outside court detective constable @entity182 said : ‘ this is the most violent piece of @entity7 footage i have seen in ten years as a police officer and it is extremely fortunate the victims were not more seriously injured			2
this case highlights the horrors of alcohol - fuelled violence			0
