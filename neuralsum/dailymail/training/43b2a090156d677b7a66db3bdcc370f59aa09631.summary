a high - flying @entity2 businesswoman lost £ 625,000 after she had an affair with a former security guard who posed as a wealthy investor , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity7 chief executive @entity6 , 46 , claimed she was so in love with @entity9 she believed his story that he was the go - between for a potential $ 1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund			1

charm : @entity6 , left , said she was duped by security guard @entity9 , right , into paying a $ 1m deposit for a bogus investment			1
the court heard the bachelor , 45 , rented a @entity26 and actually lived with his mother modest : the home in @entity20 , @entity21 , where @entity9 lived with his mother while posing as a billion - dollar investment adviser and renting a @entity26 to visit top @entity30 hotels like the @entity31 when he asked for a million dollars as a returnable “ security deposit ’ to clinch the $ 1.5 billion deal , mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity35 , 44 , agreed to transfer the money in sterling to @entity9 ’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background , a jury was told			1
mrs @entity6 alleges she was taken in by his ' charm offensive ' , which included meetings at top @entity30 hotels , and talk of introducing investors from the @entity46 and of having a @entity48 bank account			2
he rented a @entity26 to visit the @entity50 and @entity31 hotels and drove her back to her apartment in it , and later professed his love for her			1
she told the jury she was so enamoured with @entity9 that she was planning on leaving her husband but only stopped when a director of her investment firm confronted her , insisting @entity9 was a fraud - but by then she had already paid the £ 650,000 deposit			1
appearing with her husband @entity35 yesterday at @entity61 , she said : ' he said he fell in love with me			0
i was then charmed and fell in love with him			0
' there was business ... and i was dragged into falling in love with him and we were having a love affair			0
there is a personal relationship and a sexual relationship			0
there is a difference and it develops slowly			0
there are different stages of love			0
' the nature of the relationship was too deep for comfort			0
i was under additional pressure when he confessed his love			0
i reciprocated and regret that very much			0
trial : mr and mrs @entity6 , who were conned out of £ 625,000 , hid their faces as they left court ' he indicated i was a prized possession and would bring success for the company			2
i gave in to the pressure			0
it was supposed to be an in - and - out payment and would come back to us in two banking days			0
' @entity9 claimed he had contacts with @entity46 investors during the two - month scam , which he ran from his mother 's £ 56,000 terraced house in @entity20 , @entity21 , the jury heard			1
mrs @entity6 , her husband @entity35 , 44 , and a fellow investor , @entity107 , were aiming to form a hedge fund after setting up a financial firm called @entity110 in april 2012			2
@entity111 , 44 , said he knew paying a cash deposit was unusual but he agreed because @entity9 was from the @entity46 they were introduced to @entity9 though a @entity2 friend who met him at a renewable energy fair , where he said he was interested in investing his money			1
they had three meetings at @entity30 's @entity50 in the space of three weeks in august last year , and from one he drove mrs @entity6 home in a @entity26			1
at the third meeting , on august 17 , @entity9 reportedly said he wanted to introduce investors from @entity123 and @entity124 who had $ 1.5billion to put into in the couples ' hedge fund			2
they were then asked to pay a $ 1m security despot to @entity9 to ' demonstrate the legitimacy and viability ' of their firm , @entity110			1
@entity9 met mrs @entity6 again on september 7 in the @entity136 @entity135 restaurant in @entity137 , @entity30			1
by this time he had professed his love for her and promised to pay back the money as soon as he had shown it to his investors			2
without carrying out any background checks , mrs @entity6 and her husband transferred the funds to @entity9 ’s company @entity146 , the court heard			1
the alarm was raised when a worried mr @entity107 researched @entity9 and discovered the firm had net assets of just £ 657			1
mrs @entity6 returned from a business trip with @entity9 in @entity151 with a plan to leave her husband - and was confronted by mr @entity107			2
she asked for the money back and @entity9 , who had left @entity151 early , sent a text message saying : ' talke my dear			2
they should have it by five this evening			0
' another text read : ' good morning my dear hope you ’re well			0
the funds should be in your account by now as they ’re out of mine			0
' one said : ' tell him not to worry			0
he will have the funds			0
' @entity9 , left , said he had not conned @entity6 , right , and the deal fell through because her investment firm did not have a relevant trading licence			1
prosecutors say he committed fraud through a ' charm offensive ' fraud : the black mercedes in which @entity9 , 45 , arrived at @entity61 police caught up with @entity9 four weeks later , the court heard , and found him at the wheel of a black @entity184 carrying £ 1,000 in cash			1
he had bought a house for £ 175,000 and had a black @entity180 parked on the driveway			1
the @entity26 turned out to be rented - and before the scam he drove a 2003 @entity190 , the court heard			1
before the alleged scam , @entity9 worked as a security guard , lived with his mother and had bought the house with a £ 30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends			1
mr @entity111 told the court : ' we were aware for @entity199 business [ paying a cash deposit ] was uncommon , but for @entity46 business they do it this way			2
' but we decided that although it was not 100 % clear cut , given the email conversations we would go ahead			0
' this was the first time her business decision and my business decision were not correct because we were involved with someone who played a very clever game			0
' wealth : three of the meetings were at @entity30 's prestigious @entity50 , pictured , the court heard the home in @entity219 , @entity21 , where @entity9 was living when apprehended by police mrs @entity6 added : ' when i returned from @entity151 i told @entity35 i was going to get a new apartment			1
when @entity107 said : " you are being conned , this is a fraud , " my mind changed			0
' @entity226 , prosecuting , said : ' @entity227 ’ were impressed by the defendant ’s knowledge of investments , global economics and wealth fund opportunities in the @entity46			0
mr @entity9 said he wanted to make a significant investment in the hedge fund			2
' but he was dishonest from the outset and created an image about himself as being wealthy knowledgeable and practised investor with genuine investment connections			0
' the reality was that he was presenting a false existence in an endeavour to make financial gain whenever he could			0
' @entity6 particularly was deluded and so keen to gain wealthy investors for her hedge fund that she did not make the most basic check on the defendant ’s background			0
' by reason of the image the defendant had presented to @entity9 and mrs @entity6 they did not question the justification for the transfer or require any checks to be done into mr @entity9 or his company			2
' three days later mrs @entity6 saw mr @entity9 who spoke of his forthcoming journey to @entity257 to speak to his investors and discuss the money transfer			2
@entity9 , pictured outside @entity61 , has been granted conditional bail and will be sentenced later this month ' he also on that occasion told mrs @entity6 he had fallen in love with her and he had begun to charm her			2
he was putting on a show and making false statements and the charm offensive led to that position			0
' the jury was shown e-mails between @entity9 and mrs @entity6 , including one from him which said : ' they do n’t know what security deposit i am taking off you so you need to sort this out quick so i can give them the feedback			1
' when arrested @entity9 claimed the deal fell through because @entity110 did not have a relevant trading licence , the court heard			1
he denies fraud , false representation , transferring criminal property and money laundering			1

@entity9 promised @entity6 a $ 1.5bn investment , court heard
but the 45 - year - old bachelor lived with his mother in £ 56,000 terraced house
he told @entity6 , 46 , he loved her and met her at the @entity50 and the @entity31
she paid @entity9 a $ 1m security deposit after being ' fooled by rented @entity26 '
his firm in @entity20 , @entity21 , reportedly had assets of just £ 657
the security guard bought a £ 175,000 house , an @entity305 and a @entity180
@entity9 denies four charges including fraud and money laundering
