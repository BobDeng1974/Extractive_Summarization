the @entity0 has admitted it botched attempts to prevent the spread of the deadly ebola virus and has pinned the blame on some of its own staff			1
in a draft internal document , the @entity0 said it should have recognized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in @entity10 because the health systems on the continent were broken			1
in a blunt assessment of their own failings , the document said : ' nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall			1
' the @entity0 said it should have realized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in @entity10 , as it had broken health systems dr. @entity21 , co-discoverer of @entity22 , said who acted far too slowly , largely because of its @entity10 office it also said the heads of @entity0 country offices in @entity10 are ' politically motivated appointments ' made by the @entity0 regional director for @entity10 , dr. @entity30 , who does not answer to the agency 's chief in @entity34 , dr. @entity35			1
who is the @entity37 's specialized health agency , responsible for setting global health standards and coordinating the international response to disease outbreaks			0
dr. @entity21 , the co-discoverer of the ebola virus , agreed that @entity0 acted far too slowly , largely because of its @entity10 operation			1
' it 's the regional office in @entity10 that 's the front line			2
and they did n't do anything			0
that office is really not competent , ' dr @entity21 said			1
dr @entity21 , director of the @entity49 , also questioned why it took @entity0 five months and 1,000 deaths before it declared @entity22 an international health emergency in august			1
' i called for a state of emergency to be declared in july and for military operations to be deployed , ' dr @entity21 said			2
@entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 are the hardest - hit nations in the current outbreak of the deadly virus but he said @entity0 might have been scarred by its experience during the 2009 swine flu pandemic , when it was slammed for over-hyping the situation			0
in late april , during a teleconference on @entity22 among infectious disease experts that included @entity0 , @entity68 and the @entity69 , questions were apparently raised about the performance of @entity0 experts , as not all of them bothered to send @entity22 reports to @entity0 headquarters			2
who said it was ' particularly alarming ' that the head of its @entity56 office refused to help get visas for an expert @entity22 team to come in and $ 500,000 in aid was blocked by administrative hurdles			0
@entity56 , along with @entity57 and @entity58 , is one of the hardest - hit nations in the current outbreak , with 843 deaths so far blamed on @entity22			0
the @entity22 outbreak has already killed 4,484 people in @entity10 and @entity0 says within two months there could be new 10,000 cases of @entity22 every week unless more measures to fight the outbreak are taken			1
@entity22 is a serious infectious illness which often proves fatal - it can take up anything from two to 21 days for humans with the virus to show symptoms other experts said it was impossible to predict that the initial @entity22 cases in @entity56 would spark the biggest - ever outbreak of the lethal disease			2
' there were a lot of mistakes made by @entity0 but a lot of the best public health minds would have thought we could handle this in july , ' said @entity110 , an infectious diseases expert at the @entity112			0
' by the time we realized how bad things were , the genie was already out of the bottle , ' he said			0
@entity110 said the @entity37 health agency was far from the only organization to blame .			0
