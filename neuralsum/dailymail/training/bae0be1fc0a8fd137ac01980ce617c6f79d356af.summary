should @entity3 ban @entity1 after latest bite storm ? @entity1 should not be allowed to kick another ball in this @entity6 tournament			1
referee @entity7 clearly missed the coming together of @entity1 and @entity9 @entity8 and replays are clear enough to me for the @entity12 to be charged by @entity3 's disciplinary panel			2
@entity3 do not consult referees with regard to charging players retrospectively as they accept that if no action is taken the officials have missed the incident			0
video : scroll down to see the moment @entity1 appeared to bite @entity8 champing at the bit : @entity1 appears to bite @entity8 during the @entity24 showdown history repeating itself : @entity1 looked like he was back to his old ways pain game : @entity1 checks his teeth , while @entity8 holds his shoulder bite marks : @entity8 shows his wounds to the ref after a clash with @entity1 hurt : @entity1 holds his mouth after the incident with @entity8 @entity37 hands @entity39 problem ' we are awaiting the official match report and will gather all the necessary elements before making a decision			1
â€™ the score at the time of the incident was 0 - 0 , a result good enough for the @entity9 to qualify			0
however there is no prospect of a rematch or a change to @entity53 qualifying			0
@entity3 has ordered a game to be replayed after a refereeing error ( @entity58 v @entity56 in qualifying for @entity59 2006 ) but this is not in the same category			0
no remorse : @entity1 celebrates at the final whistle job done : @entity1 and his @entity53 team - mates are into the last 16 standing tall : @entity1 shows no sign the clash with @entity8 is playing on his mind worry free : @entity1 looks like he 's enjoying himself after the game @entity69 and tumble : @entity1 received some tough treatment during the game			1

@entity39 *striker* looked like he was back to his *wicked* ways after clash
@entity1 was hit with a *10* - game ban for biting @entity79 last april
@entity53 ace should be *suspended* for the rest of the tournament
