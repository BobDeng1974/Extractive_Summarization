two weeks earlier mr @entity5 had moved into the @entity64 home of his new girlfriend , @entity65 , then aged 25 , the mother of @entity58			1
initially , both mr @entity5 and the victim 's mother were charged with capital murder , the @entity66 reports			1

she also told detectives : ' i may have burned @entity58 's foot when i carried him , but only once			0

' we should be ashamed of the errors that put @entity5 on the brink of execution			2
he is far from the only innocent person to receive a death sentence , ' said mr @entity34			0
' a recent study estimated that , conservatively , one in every 25 people sentenced to death in the @entity84 is innocent			0
in such a broken system of justice , we are foolish and cruel to continue capital punishment			0
' according to @entity147 's director @entity146 , ' the release of former death row inmate @entity5 in @entity11 today underscores the many problems that continue to plague the death penalty and the ongoing risk of executing the innocent			1
his ' case contained a litany of injustices , including police misconduct , prosecutorial deception , ineffectiveness of defense counsel , and untruthful witnesses			0
