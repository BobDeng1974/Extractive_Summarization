dr @entity0 says that the majority of diets fail due to emotional eating
to diet successfully we need to establish what emotions cause us to snack
take her quiz to discover what kind of emotional eater you are
accept you 're entitled to your feelings and ' own ' your anger . this anger tells you a situation needs to be sorted .
record angry thoughts with a *dictaphone* / voice activated app. listening back helps you understand these feelings , get them out of your **system** and choose an appropriate response .
now plan steps towards changing / solving what angers you .
***challenge*** your negative belief **system** there 's always someone / something to blame . the ' finger of blame ' does n't point to solutions !
begin to take a ' stuff hap*pen*s ' *attitude* .
when angry ' think in ink ' , putting *pen* to paper , **devise** ways to approach the person you 're upset with .
**devise** your own motto like : i wo n't let anger eat me up because then i 'll emotionally eat !
when angry and feeling the *impulse* to emotionally eat take a brisk five - minute walk - even if at work go back and forth *briskly* to the staff toilet . remind yourself the issue you 're angry about is n't worth it .
start saying ' no ' to extra **responsibilities** . by cutting **responsibilities** you give yourself a better chance of *de-stressing* .
*delegate* as much as possible - many stressed - out people feel they have to do - it - all .
***challenge*** your stressy ' thinking - is this something you really need to stress about ? could you face it in a calm manner ?
change your inner voice to one that *repeatedly* says it 's going to be fine .
emotional stress causes ***physical*** tension to build . *subconsciously* you 're **aware** of this ***physical*** tension which feeds your *cycle* of stress . so do regular stress - *busting* exercise plus *calming* *meditation* .
@entity254 , the emotional *bonding* *hormone* , combats stress so get lots of hugs and ***physical*** *affection* from your partner , family , children , etc.
let go and live a little as many stressed - out people forget having fun is a *fantastic* stress - *antidote* . go to a comedy night , have a picnic , meet up with friends , etc.
head off potential *problems* that cause you stress like allowing extra time to get out the door in the *morning* , to meet *deadlines* , etc.
when tempted to emotionally eat take five minutes to look through photos of your last *relaxing* *holiday* or fun time with family and friends to calm you .
be **aware** of the emotionally *draining* ' *disease* - to - please ' where insecurities mean you 're always *aiming* to please others .
list your three best *qualities* where you can see them many times a day – focus on these .
do n't believe the myth that everyone else feels **confident** - many do n't but they fake it to make it . ' *faking* it to make it ' can boost feelings of security .
insecure people remind themselves of recent failures instead remind yourself of when you coped well with something .
get more secure about *expressing* your feelings / beliefs / *attitude*s with the ' @entity313 ' : plan what you want to say , practice it so you feel **confident** , put it into action .
switch off your negative inner voice that says you 're ' *useless* *”* , etc. ***challenge*** it each time it starts .
stop taking things personally like , e.g. , your manager 's *criticism* of a piece of work as about you as a person .
when tempted to emotionally eat ring that person who always makes you feel better about yourself for a *reassuring* chat .
if *harbouring* painful *memories* from past trauma or *difficulties* get professional help - it 's never too late to start the healing process .
if you do n't want formal help there are support *groups* for many different issues . you 'll feel better knowing you 've started this *journey* .
dump the belief that you 're not ' worth ' the bother of professional help . you are !
start believing that it 's okay to o*pen* up to people you trust .
for some much of letting go of past pain is believing it 's ' okay ' to do so . give yourself *permission* to say you can live life more happily from today .
ring fence new issues that you will face more *positively* from today . do n't allow them to be *clouded* by negative feelings from your past .
when tempted to emotionally eat remind yourself you 're getting stronger every day and make it your motto that your past wo n't dictate your present or *future* .
