the @entity0 has always been used by @entity1 as a chance to showcase their academy graduates			1
and with @entity4 facing an injury crisis in defence ahead of tuesday night 's second round tie at @entity8 , a 22 - year - old right - back called @entity10 could be pressed into action			1
but who is he ? here 's our lowdown on the young @entity15			0
name : @entity10 age : 22 club : @entity1 position : right - back getting stuck in : @entity1 's @entity15 right - back @entity10 ( right ) slides in on @entity22 's @entity21 during last friday 's @entity24 encounter at @entity25 why all the fuss ? @entity4 faces a bit of a headache as he makes his team selection for the tricky - looking trip to @entity31 as @entity1 enter the @entity0 at the second round stage for the first time since 1995			1
@entity34 limped off with a groin injury in the first half of sunday 's @entity24 draw at @entity38 and is unlikely to make it , while @entity40 is also a doubt			2
new signing from @entity44 @entity43 has n't received his work permit in time to make his debut and so @entity1 are struggling a little for men at the back			2
enter @entity10 , who could be in line to make his first @entity1 start in two years at stadium : mk , most likely alongside @entity52 and fellow academy graduate @entity53			1
selection dilemma : injury problems could force @entity4 to field an untried back line at @entity8 forced off : @entity34 picked up a groin strain in @entity1 's draw at @entity38 on sunday too soon : new £ 16m signing @entity43 has n't received a work permit in time to play the 22 - year - old has waited some time since his @entity1 debut , which came on september 26 , 2012 when he played 77 minutes in a @entity0 tie with @entity64			1
it was a campaign in which @entity10 appeared in the @entity1 squad on other occasions - twice in the @entity68 and at @entity69 in both the @entity0 and @entity70 - but did n't gain any further time on the pitch			1
now , having gained more experience during a season - long loan with @entity77 side @entity76 , it looks as though he will have another chance to impress			1
what 's his background ? @entity10 was born on january 13 , 1992 in @entity81 , a small town close to the @entity77 border in the north of @entity84 and joined the academy of @entity86 at the age of 16			1
with @entity1 's scouting network well established in the @entity89 , @entity10 was picked out despite not making a senior appearance for the @entity15 top flight side			1
his delighted dad revealed the news of his contract at @entity95 in 2010 , after a £ 250,000 compensation payment had been agreed with @entity86			0
' they said he was the best right or left - back they had seen in years , ' @entity97 told @entity102			2
shadowed : @entity10 keeps a close check on @entity22 's @entity104 during the @entity106 game ' [ @entity107 ] @entity107 told me that @entity10 in the following years would become a fixture in the @entity1 squad			2
' @entity107 and then - reserve team coach @entity111 had clearly seen potential in him , as they had in his compatriot @entity114			0
and he made an immediate impression when he scored twice , playing in a more advanced position , in a pre-season friendly with @entity118			0
part of the attraction had been @entity10 's ability to play right across the back four , or even on the right side of midfield , but he quickly settled into the right - back role			1
he became a mainstay in @entity1 's reserve team during the 2010 - 2011 season and picked up a winners ' medal in 2012 when @entity1 defeated @entity130 on penalties			2
his consistent displays in the reserves led to @entity107 calling him up to the first - team squad for the first time in the @entity0 last 16 tie at @entity137 on october 25 , 2011			2
he did n't feature in the 3 - 0 win , however			0
the following season was another encouraging one for @entity10 , with his handful of first - team squad selections balanced with a leading role in @entity1 winning the inaugural @entity24			1
he scored one and created another in the @entity95 final against @entity145 , inspiring a @entity1 comeback from two goals down to win 3 - 2			0
under 21 coach @entity148 shortlisted him for the club 's @entity151 award , capping a fine year			0
battler : @entity10 goes in for a challenge with @entity154 during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity25 going @entity77 with the departure of @entity107 and the arrival of @entity158 at the start of last season , @entity10 was sent out on loan to @entity76 in @entity162 , where he was a regular starter at right - back			1
he performed well , with three league and one cup goal during the season , which unfortunately culminated in relegation from the @entity169 for the @entity76 club			2
his performances resulted in a call - up to the @entity84 under 21 side , but @entity158 seemed indifferent to the young player			0
in march , @entity10 's agent said his client 's future would depend on whether @entity158 remained at @entity95			0
' if the manager stays , then it does not look good because he let @entity10 go quite easily to @entity76			2
' if @entity158 is sacked , it may open greater chances			0
' as we all know , @entity158 was shown the door and @entity10 , who has one year left on his contract , is back in the frame at @entity1 , with @entity4 keen to assess what he can do			1
he played a full 90 minutes in the under 21 side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity22 at @entity25 last week and could now be set for another first - team chance , especially if the injury crisis worsens			0
where does he play ? as mentioned , @entity10 is a right - back , or the right - sided operator in @entity4 's hallmark 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
but in his younger days , he was more of a forward or a winger and so is n't afraid to get forward in support of the midfield if necessary			0
one of his main attractions when @entity1 first signed him was his versatility and , if required , @entity10 could slot in right across the back line			1
like our dedicated @entity1 facebook page			0
out on loan : @entity10 spent last season with @entity77 club @entity76 to gain experience strengths and weaknesses @entity10 is well - regarded for his consistency and , in the @entity77 league at least , was seldom found wanting by speedy wingers			1
if beaten , he possesses the pace to recover position and is a reliable winner of the ball in the tackle			0
during his campaign in @entity162 , he received just one booking			0
if he is to be part of @entity4 's team , he 'll have to show quality going forward and he does have a decent quick - step to get beyond defenders and a fairly good cross			0
one thing that was exposed in the @entity169 , however , was his passing , with too many balls going astray			0
international honours ? yes , @entity10 has been capped by @entity84 at every level from under 17 to under 21			1
in all , he has 43 caps for @entity84 across the various standards and has scored five times .			0

injury problems could hand @entity10 a start at right - back for @entity1 in their @entity0 tie at @entity8
@entity15 defender has made just one senior appearance for @entity1
the 22 - year - old spent last season on loan with @entity77 club @entity76
@entity10 is a capable of playing right across the defence and further forward
has been capped by @entity84 at @entity24 level
