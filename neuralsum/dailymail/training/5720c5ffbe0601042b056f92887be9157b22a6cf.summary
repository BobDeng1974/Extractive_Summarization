by @entity0 at first glance , they appear to be the sort of pictures that grace any family album — but look a little closer			1
two of the faces are very familiar — and they usually bear scowls rather than smiles			2
they belong to none other than two of @entity12 's most feared gangsters : @entity13 and @entity14			1
since their heyday in the @entity17 and @entity18 , ' the twins ' , as they were known , have become synonymous with a sleazy sort of spurious glamour			1
they have become almost iconic figures who transcended the worlds of entertainment , politics and vicious criminality in which they moved			2
strong arms : @entity30 hardman @entity29 lifts two other members of the gang wartime evacuees : @entity13 ( second left ) and @entity14 ( fourth left ) in @entity34 these previously unseen pictures , which feature in a new book on the brothers , were drawn from the private collections of friends of the @entity40			1
in them , we see the twins surrounded by their childhood pals such as ' @entity45 , and friends they made later , such as ' @entity47 , a valued member of the @entity40 ' gang , which went by the euphemistic name of ' the firm '			1
we also see them in their later years , enjoying the life made possible by the proceeds of their crimes			2
study these snapshots for any length of time and the menace in the scenarios they record becomes apparent			2
in one , a brilliantined @entity14 and @entity13 and a gang of what they would undoubtedly call ' associates ' affect an uneasy bonhomie in some @entity70 drinking den. but , one senses , the laughs wo n't last			1
the twins , clutching halfs of bitter , exude a sense of dead - eyed threat , the hint of a sneer curling around their lips			2
backyard boys : even in this family snap taken in @entity30 with older brother @entity83 's son , @entity82 , the twins @entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 still exude a brooding air of villainy @entity47 , in the centre of the picture , sizes up a gap - toothed , grinning hanger - on , perhaps assessing whether he is ' taking liberties ' and needs ' sorting '			1
@entity47 was a glaswegian who met @entity14 when the two men were on remand in @entity94			1
he was soon given a job as a doorman at the @entity40 ' @entity98 club in the @entity70			0
' @entity47 's weight was between 17 and 18st and could he could punch his weight , ' @entity14 later recalled			1
' he had a couple of scars on his face due to various battles he had been in , and when he and @entity106 were fighting @entity107 they were a good team to have on one 's side			0
' in the swim : @entity70 lads relaxing at the local lido , but @entity14 ( second left ) already had a fearsome reputation tragic spouse : @entity14 with his ill - fated young wife , @entity116 , and a friend drinks with the @entity40 : @entity13 ( far left ) and @entity14 ( far right ) in an @entity70 pub , with bodyguard @entity120 ( centre , rear ) in another picture , conveying all the grit and grime of the old @entity70 , the twins stand in front of a ramshackle fence in a back alley in @entity30			1
a bored - looking @entity14 holds their brother @entity83 's son , @entity82			1
@entity13 — hands thrust deep in his pockets , tie tightly knotted but askew — glares moodily at the photographer			1
in another shot , @entity29 demonstrates his prodigious strength by holding aloft two gang members			0
like the @entity40 , @entity29 was born in @entity30 and into villainy			0
his father had been imprisoned for taking part in a raid on a warehouse where he was employed as a security guard			0
@entity29 and his brother @entity144 were great friends of the @entity40 , and @entity29 's girth proved useful in many a gangland scrap			2
a habitual criminal , he eventually graduated from borstal to @entity149			0
@entity150 turn : pianist @entity152 , local children and a sullen @entity13 the @entity40 themselves were almost born to a life of crime			1
their father , @entity157 , was hardly the ideal role model			0
at the outbreak of the @entity160 he was called up to join the @entity161 , but deserted			0
frequently away from home and up to no good , the twins probably saw more of the police , who kept visiting their house at 178 @entity167 in @entity30 , than they did their father			2
it was up to their mother , @entity170 , to keep the family together , which was a struggle			0
for a while , her three sons stayed out of trouble , and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring , where the twins would win many a competition			2
close : a photo @entity181 signed for @entity13 however , by their late teens , @entity13 and @entity14 were also fighting on the streets , and they soon started their own gang			1
when they turned 18 in 1951 , they decided that military service was not for them			0
they spent most of their @entity189 in the guardroom			0
matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen , and were imprisoned in @entity195 in @entity196			0
upon their return to the @entity70 , it was clear they would never settle into regular lives			0
their first business venture was a club called the @entity205 , off the @entity206 , which looked like a dive from the outside but which the @entity40 turned into a glamorous , fashionable nightspot			0
in their sharp suits , they did their best to maintain , publicly at least , a veneer of respectability , but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable , from straightforward theft to gang violence and — ultimately — murder			0
of the two siblings , @entity13 was considered the more dangerous			1
he was imprisoned in 1957 for @entity221			0
while locked up , he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia , which partly explained his violent tendencies			0
unusually for that time , @entity13 was also publicly bisexual , which @entity14 found difficult to accept			1
despite @entity14 also being jailed in 1959 , the @entity40 ' business ' activities went from strength to strength , and by the @entity18 they were hobnobbing with stars such as @entity181 , and eminent politicians such as @entity231 , with whom @entity13 is likely to have had an affair			1
@entity13 remained unmarried , and @entity14 's marriage to @entity234 in 1965 only lasted for eight months			1
it is thought that she committed suicide , although according to one account , @entity116 was murdered by @entity13 , for reasons that are unclear			1
in the middle of 1968 , the twins disappear from the family album , for the simple reason that they and older brother @entity83 were arrested for murder			2
@entity13 had shot a rival gang member called @entity247 in the face when he was drinking in a pub , and @entity14 , normally the ' gentle ' one , had repeatedly stabbed gang member @entity250 ' the @entity251 in the face and neck for not following orders			1
both men were given life sentences , with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years			0
@entity83 was sent down for ten years , for being an accessory to the murder of @entity260			0
the next time the brothers were photographed together was not for any family album , but for the newspapers , when they were allowed out of prison to attend their mother 's funeral in 1982			2
their father died a year later , and by 2000 , both the twins and their brother had followed him			2
the @entity40 ' family album may be full of memories but , one suspects , very few of them are happy			0
