the brutal murder of @entity1 at the hands of her ex-boyfriend led to new laws being introduced to protect women from men with a violent history			1
leading the charge for change was @entity1 's heartbroken father , @entity10 , a retired prison officer from @entity11 , @entity12 , who would never had imagined he would one day be rallying mps and making impassioned speeches in the @entity15			1
this year @entity16 ( officially called the @entity17 ) , was finally passed five years after her murder			1
now her father has spoken of his grief and how her death forced him to fight for justice			1
crime that shook @entity24 : @entity1 was murdered by her boyfriend @entity25 but her legacy has resulted in a law to help other women find out about their partner 's violent pasts unexpected campaigner : @entity1 's father , pictured with her when she was younger , felt he had to fight for justice for other women following his daughter 's death he said of the campaign : ' i was handed a baton , which i really could n't put down			1
the more i held onto it , the bigger it got			2
it sparked something off in the media , the papers ; i was inundated			2
' i ended up talking in the @entity15			2
i ended up talking to women 's groups			2
before @entity1 died , i would n't have said boo to a goose			1
but i was encouraged on by people who said " you 're doing right			2
what you 're asking is common sense			2
" ' mr @entity10 called for a change in the law and better communication between police forces so that women can be given information about a partner 's previous history of violence if they request it			1
the law has now been implemented but it came too late for single mother @entity1 , 36 , who was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend @entity25 at her home in @entity67 , @entity68 , in february 2009			1
@entity1 had met her killer on @entity70 and had no idea he had a history of violence against women			1
however , she soon discovered his aggression and had contacted the police on various occasions to complain against offences he had committed against her			2
when she tried to leave him , he committed the fatal attack and then later killed himself			2
in a new interview for a documentary , ' @entity81 ' on the @entity85 channel , mr @entity10 said he had taken an ' instant dislike ' to @entity87 and knew he was ' basically rotten ' when his daughter brought him home			1
he said he tried to dissuade @entity1 from continuing their relationship to no avail			1
however , despite his misgivings about @entity87 , he had no idea at the time about the terrible way he was treating his daughter all the way to @entity97 : @entity10 's actions led to @entity16 being passed as the @entity17			1
he 's pictured here with his partner @entity100 , left , and mp @entity101 he said : ' to find out that my daughter had been interviewed by the police on five or six occasions , that there ’d been a stopper put on her letterbox because he had threatened to pour petrol and set the house on fire			0
if i had known , i would have been down there in a second i really would			0
' i 'm not the tallest of fellas , and i 've met bully boys all through my life , and bullying does n't stop at the playground gates , it continues in life			0
and i had recognised that in @entity25 too late			0
' on the night she died , @entity87 went to @entity1 ’s house and strangled her in her bed then set her body on fire			1
' to know that a member of my family spent their last minutes on this earth kicking , screaming and fighting			0
because some idiot could n't take no for an answer			0
it leaves me dumbfounded , it really does , ' mr @entity10 said			1
he added : ' even now it still puzzles me			0
the mentality of @entity25 to take my daughter 's life and then take his own			0
for what ? ! what the hell did any of it achieve ? ! nothing ! nothing ! ' but mr @entity10 has been able to achieve something after campaigning for @entity16 which was championed by @entity145 including @entity101 and @entity146			1
the bereft father said he knew he had to do something to prevent another family suffered like he had			1
gone but not forgotten : @entity10 ca n't bring his little girl back but he wanted to prevent other women becoming victims of domestic violence he said : ' it dawned on me that for every person like me or every girl that was killed like @entity1 , i likened it to like dropping a pebble into a pond			1
there was two parents , brothers , sisters , uncles , aunties , grannies , family and friends all with the same sorrow , the same grief , the same mental torture of " why did n't i see it coming ? " ' but he admits while @entity16 will never pout an end to domestic violence , he hopes it will go some way to helping other sufferers			1
it is this thought that allows him some peace and hope after his years of grieving			0
he said : ' i would like to think that now at least one girl in the @entity24 who had the sense to go to the bobbies and say , " has he ? " escapes what happened to my kid			0
and that would be just the icing on the cake			0
i ask for no more than that			0
if i 've saved one , i 'll be delighted			0
' speaking on the documentary , @entity146 said the implementation of @entity16 shows progress is being made but there is still a long way to go to end domestic violence			1
she said : ' sadly the figures that we see for violence against women and girls remain quite stubborn			0
i mean it 's quite difficult to change those			2
but i think the changes that the government has made ; i think the new tools and powers we 've introduced are an important part of changing			0
' but it is about changing culture and attitudes as well			0
there is still a lot more to do			0
the government has done a lot but there is a lot more work to do and we will continue to focus on this because i want to see an end to violence against women and girls			0
i want to see an end to domestic violence			0
it is an abhorrent crime			0
