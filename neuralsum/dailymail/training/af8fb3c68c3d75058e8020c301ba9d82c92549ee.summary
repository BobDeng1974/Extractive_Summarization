in a dramatic attempt to crackdown on red tape , @entity5 will ban the introduction of new regulation by any government department which would hit small firms			1
he is expected to say : ' on my watch , new regulations will now only extend to small businesses if they are essential , justified and where disproportionate burdens are fully mitigated			1
and where regulation is not fit for purpose it will be reformed or binned			1
' cutting red tape : business and enterprise minister @entity5 will announce changes today the crackdown will come into effect immediately , and will apply to small businesses employing up to 50 staff			1

of the 4.8million businesses in this country , only 1.2million actually employ one or more people , according to official figures			0
it comes after red tape has for years been regularly cited by small firms as the biggest problem that they face			1
while entrepreneurs want to be focused on growing their business , millions complain their time is wasted on the constant mountain of red tape paperwork which needs to be filled in			0
small business lobby groups have regularly warned their members are ' hammered ' by red tape which they insist is thwarting @entity29 's chance of a full economic recovery			2
today mr @entity5 will say he has listened to their fury about red tape , and promise to stem the flow of time - consuming regulation which distracts them day in , day out			2
