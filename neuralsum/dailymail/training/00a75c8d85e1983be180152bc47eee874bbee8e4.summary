by @entity0 a 10 - year - old @entity2 girl from @entity3 suffering an aggressive form of cancer has stopped her chemotherapy treatment in favor of traditional @entity9 treatments			1
@entity10 , an @entity11 girl from the @entity13 reserve , can be seen in a video posted to @entity15 explaining her reasons for wanting to quit the treatment			1
@entity10 's parents , @entity19 and @entity20 , allowed their daughter to give up the chemotherapy , a move that prompted doctors at @entity25 where @entity10 was being treated to alert children 's aid authorities			1
@entity10 was diagnosed with @entity38 ( all ) in january and suffered terrible weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat it despite anti-nausea medications			2
she underwent 11 weeks of the chemo , which sent her cancer into remission			0
however , according to @entity48 , a publication aimed at the @entity51 community , doctors say that in order to rid @entity10 of the cancer completely , she needs to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival			1
' coming to the last weeks of her treatment alarms started to go off inside of me , ' @entity10 ’s mother , @entity20 told @entity48			1
' it was that maternal instinct that told me that we ’re not doing the right thing with her ... @entity10 said to me , " do you have the power to get me out of there ? if you have the power to take me out of there i want you to take me out of there			2
i ’m telling you @entity72 , it ’s not right			0
the way that we are going it ’s going to kill me			0
" ' the @entity76 took @entity10 home , weakened and with a 10lb weight loss , for two weeks to recover after her first treatment			2
family support : @entity19 and @entity20 say the decision to come of chemotherapy was their daughter 's and that they believe she will be healed by traditional therapies ' i have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because i do n't want to go this way anymore ... i know that what i have can kill me , but i do n't want to die in a hospital on chemo , ' @entity92 says in the video			1
during the two weeks respite from chemo , @entity10 's parents started her on a different form of treatment , which has left her feeling ' awesome , ' she says			1
' i wish that the doctors would listen to me , because i live in this body and they do n't , ' she says			0
also during that time , @entity10 says she had a vision of @entity32 , flanked by two angels , who told her she was already healed , and not to be afraid			1
this last revelation has caused @entity25 to pursue court action with the governmental consent and @entity110 to determine if @entity10 and her parents are of sound mind			1
according to @entity48 , if @entity10 or her parents are found to be not of unsound mind , the @entity113 will forcibly remove @entity10 from the @entity13 reservation and start her back on chemotherapy			1
the @entity76 could also lose their other two children			0
eloquent : @entity10 wrote in a letter she read allowed that she wishes the doctors would listen to her , ' because i live in this body and they do n't ' ' it ’s pure ignorance to think that @entity131 medicine is the only answer , ' @entity2 healer @entity123 , who claims to have successfully treated cancer , leukemia and other life - threatening illnesses , told @entity133			1
' what medicine people do is they go to the spirit and ask that spirit and find a way within that person to help them , ' said @entity123 , who works at the @entity141			2
according to @entity48 , the @entity142 asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination			0
@entity10 's parents say they will defend their daughter 's right to pursue traditional medicine			1
' if someone does try to take @entity10 away we are assured 100 per cent that people will be there to stop apprehension , " @entity20 told @entity152			2
' people know the consequences and they ’re willing to stand in and protect her at all costs			0
… if that ’s what it comes down to , they need to be physical			0
we ’re going to do what it takes to make sure that our daughter is protected			0
' they wo n't say exactly what treatments @entity10 is undergoing , but they say that they appear to be working			2
i gained some of my weight back			0
i ’m eating and drinking and i can hold it all down			0
and i am getting my strength back , ' @entity10 says in the video .			0
