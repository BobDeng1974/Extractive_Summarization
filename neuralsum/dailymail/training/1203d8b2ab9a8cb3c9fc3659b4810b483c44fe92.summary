by @entity1 reporter published : 06:54 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 24 june 2013 convicted murderer @entity2 has suggested on @entity4 that she may consider a plea deal to avoid a death sentence rather than appeal her guilty verdict			1
in a tweet posted this weekend , @entity8 suggested she had not yet made up her mind on which option to go for			2
her @entity4 account , managed on her behalf by friends , posted on saturday the following two messages : ' let 's clear up any confusion			0
anyone asking 4 donation $ right now on my behalf 4 my appeals is not legit			0
' convicted : @entity8 , pictured appearing in court last week , has speculated that she may consider a plea deal to avoid the death penalty new wardrobe : throughout the five - month trial , @entity2 wore prim sweaters and button - down shirts but today she was seen wearing the stripes and shackles of all @entity33 prison inmates this was quickly followed by another stating , ' i 'm not currently accepting donations 4 appeals			1
just do n't know yet if i will plea or appeal			0
' last week a jury failed to decide upon a sentence for @entity8 ' crimes ; she will either receive a life sentence or she could be sentenced to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend @entity2			1
an earlier trial heard how @entity8 , 32,stabbed and slashed @entity47 nearly 30 times , slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead			2
she then left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later			0
@entity57 attorney @entity56 said last month he would have an ' ethical obligation ' to consider a plea deal if the defense offered one , according to @entity62			1
appearing in court for the first time since the @entity33 jury was unable to decide her sentence for murder , @entity8 last week swapped her prim , collared shirts and business - like attire that she sported throughout her lengthy murder trial for the standard issue stripes now that she is behind bars			1
the procedural hearing lacked the sizzle of the five - month trial , which concluded in may , that attracted a global following and had spectators waiting in line in the middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom			0
last thursday , the courtroom was about two - thirds full , the hearing was not televised , and there were no arguments in open court			0
that verdict will come even later than previously expected , as the judge ruled today that the next hearing is scheduled for july 18			0
smiling through the process : @entity2 has already been convicted of murder but now she awaits her sentencing jury selection alone could take weeks , given the difficulty of seating an impartial panel in the high - profile case			1
prosecutors have the option of taking the death penalty off the table , and @entity104 would then sentence @entity8 to one of two punishments : life in prison or the more unlikely life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years			1
if prosecutors do pursue death , a new panel must be seated to determine a sentence			0
if another deadlock occurs , the death penalty would automatically be removed , leaving the judge to sentence @entity8 to one of the life - in - prison options			1
@entity57 attorney @entity56 said last week his office continues to prepare for a retrial aimed at securing a death sentence			2
he had previously said he is confident an impartial jury can be seated to determine @entity8 ' punishment but added that he is open to input from defense lawyers and the victim 's family about possibly scrapping a new trial in favor of a life sentence for @entity8			1
meanwhile , after losing motions for mistrials , appeals to higher courts and efforts to quit the case altogether , @entity8 ' attorneys tried a new tactic this month , appealing to the court of public opinion while hoping to influence @entity56 's decision			0
decisions : the next hearing will be held on july 18 and that is when they will begin the process of picking a new jury for the sentencing portion ' it is solely for them to determine if continuing to pursue a death sentence upon ms. @entity8 , who is already facing a mandatory life sentence , is a good and proper use of taxpayer resources , ' defense attorneys @entity149 and @entity151 wrote in a statement provided to the @entity158			1
taxpayers footed the bill for @entity8 ' court - appointed attorneys at a cost so far of nearly $ 1.7million , a price tag that will only balloon if the case moves forward			2
@entity8 , 32 , admitted she killed @entity47 , but claimed it was self - defense after he attacked her			2
prosecutors argued it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to @entity176 with another woman			0
after murdering @entity47 , @entity8 left her ex-boyfriend 's body in his shower where friends found him about five days later			2
she testified for 18 days during her five - month trial , describing for jurors an abusive childhood , cheating boyfriends , dead - end jobs , a shocking sexual relationship with @entity47 , and her contention that he had grown physically abusive .			0
