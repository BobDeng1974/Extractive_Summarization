@entity1 stabbed @entity2 to death outside @entity15 pub in @entity4 ’s @entity16 - causing ' lethal ' injuries to his heart , lungs and liver			1
he denied the attack - which took place in front of a string of witnesses - and tried to shift the blame onto a mutual friend of his and mr @entity2 ’s			1
but a jury took just two hours to reject @entity1 ’s story and convict him of murdering mr @entity2 by a majority verdict			1
after the verdict was delivered , advocate depute @entity32 told the court that @entity1 had 19 previous convictions - including one for assault to injury			1
and she added : ' the accused is in a relationship and has three children from that union			2
' but it is believed he has another 13 children from various other relationships			0
' a nine - day trial at the @entity47 in @entity4 heard how @entity1 had clashed with mr @entity2 in the toilets of @entity50 bar during a mutual friend ’s 50th birthday party			1
mr @entity2 was seen with blood coming from a wound above his eye as he left the toilets - before he followed @entity1 outside the pub , where a ' scuffle ' broke out			1
the fight moved into neighbouring @entity60 , with @entity61 - who ’s 50th birthday the pair had been attending - getting between the pair trying to ' separate ' them			0
witnesses told the court they then saw @entity1 repeatedly strike mr @entity2 in the chest in a ' stabbing motion '			1
he was then seen to ' stagger ' backwards with a ' stunned ' look and blood ' gushing ' from his chest			0
mr @entity2 walked back into @entity16 before collapsing , with mr @entity61 trying to put pressure on his wounds as an ambulance rushed to the scene			1
the court heard that mr @entity2 suffered ' lethal ' stab wounds to his heart , lungs and liver - and ' would have died even if he had been stabbed in the hospital car park ' , according to a medical @entity84 died around an hour and a half after the attack at @entity4 ’s @entity87			1
@entity1 with @entity88 who has had three children with him			1
also in the picture are his daughter @entity91 ( now aged 16 ) and on @entity92 ( now aged 10 ) meanwhile , @entity1 fled , jumping into a taxi and making his way to meet notorious @entity4 underworld figure @entity95 - who has links to @entity98 gangster @entity97			1
@entity95 later burned @entity1 ’s blood spattered t - shirt , and told the court he drove @entity102 around various streets in @entity4 while @entity1 sat with a snake around his neck			1
@entity1 sent a string of texts to former partners in the minutes after the attack - telling @entity109 , 21 , the mother of his 16th child , who was born in november 2011 , that ' it wasnae for nothing '			1
@entity1 was dubbed @entity7 's most feckless father ' after having 17 children by 15 different mothers			1
he is now facing life behind bars he told another that he had ' done someone '			0
@entity1 was arrested the following day , on june 2 last year , in his grandfather ’s car - with a bag containing his bloodstained shoes and clothes			1
he told cops ' i ’ve thrown my life away ' as they took him to @entity127 in @entity4 city centre			1
a forensic examination of his clothes found mr @entity2 ’s blood inside the pockets of his jeans and inside his shirt			1
@entity1 , 36 , a prisoner at @entity135 , denied that he had murdered @entity2 by repeatedly striking him on the body with a knife or similar instrument			1
@entity1 has lodged a special defence of incrimination on the murder charge , alleging that @entity61 committed the crime			1
but a jury of eight men and seven women took just over two hours to find him guilty of murder by majority			1
@entity148 , defending , said he would reserve his plea in mitigation until a later sentencing date			0
judge @entity152 of @entity153 said @entity1 faces a life sentence when he appears at the @entity47 in @entity155 on april 3			1
she said : ' the penalty for murder is of course prescribed by law			2
' but i require a report before i can sentence			0
' @entity1 showed no emotion as the verdict was read - but bowed his head as he was led in handcuffs to the cells			2
no - one from either family made any comment as they left the court			0
@entity1 was first branded ' @entity7 ’s most feckless father ' in late 2011 after it emerged he had fathered 16 children by 14 different mothers			2
but now he will miss the younger years of all those children as he faces life in prison over the murder of @entity2 outside the @entity15 pub in @entity4 on june 1 last year			1
@entity1 ’s profligate procreation came to light when his mother , @entity181 , launched a scathing attack on his bedhopping antics			1
she said : ' we do n’t speak to each other , and , even though i love him as my child , i am bitterly disappointed with how he lives his life			0
' it ’s difficult to keep up with it all , but i do my best to see all the kids			0
' he just does n’t seem bothered , even though he thinks he ’s " @entity193 " because he lives with three of them			0
' it ’s sad he does n’t see his eldest who i have looked after since she was born			0
' the girls he is running around with just now are not much older than her - he just loves teenagers			0
' i would say he is a sexual predator			0
' @entity1 was just 17 when his first daughter was born in 1995 , but once the baby arrived he moved his affections to the mum 's cousin			2
the baby was left with @entity1 ’s parents to raise as their own , and the daughter has seen her own mother only twice since			2
between 1997 and 2002 , @entity1 then fathered another five children with five different mothers			2
in 2004 , he had two girls and a boy who were all born within months of each other , and between december 2007 and august 2008 the former barman fathered three more offspring			0
the only woman @entity1 has had more than one child with is an on - off girlfriend - they have three children together			2
she gave birth to his 14th child in july 2010 , and he became a father for the 15th time in november 2011 when a teenager he had a brief fling with gave birth to a baby boy			0
@entity109 , 21 , had his 16th child later that month			0
she gave evidence against him during his murder trial , telling the court he had written to her : ' it wasnae for nothing - i was in a mood and he was being a prick			2
' and his 17th was born in early 2012 to another teenage mum , who has not been identified			0
@entity1 defended his behaviour - claiming he was following the @entity240 commandment to ' go forth and multiply '			2
he said : ' i ’ve sat in loads of bars over the years and heard people moaning about the population falling in @entity4			2
' i ’ve been doing my best to repopulate the town			0
' i ’ve done my bit , but i know that on @entity247 , i might pay for my sins			0
' @entity1 added : ' contraception is a two - way thing			2
if women are going to have sex with me and do n’t want a baby , why do n’t they take the @entity255 ? ' i ’m a big boy , 6ft 4in , well - built and i ’m in proportion			0
' i know they ’re supposed to make condoms for larger men these days , but i ’ve not found one yet			0
' the reality is all these women have been happy to have my babies			0
' maybe some of them thought i was a good catch			0
others believed i ’d settle down with them			0
' i never promised them anything			0
