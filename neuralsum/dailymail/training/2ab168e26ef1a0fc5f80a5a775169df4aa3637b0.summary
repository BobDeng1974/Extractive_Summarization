above , @entity25 in @entity26 , which organised the adoption yesterday , the country ’s most senior family judge upheld the adoption plan			1
but he criticised social workers from @entity23 for the way they condemned the parents because of their views			1
sir @entity35 , @entity36 , said in a @entity38 judgment : ‘ it was , in my view , unfortunate that the local authority should have referred at one stage in the proceedings to the parents ’ views on homosexuality in such a way as to suggest that they are bigoted			2
the label is unnecessary and hurtful			0
’ judge : yesterday , the country 's most senior family judge , sir @entity35 , upheld the adoption plan , but criticised the social workers for the way they condemned the parents because of their views his criticism is understood to follow a report submitted to the court by social workers which said : ‘ the attitude of the parents could be perceived as bigoted			1
’ the row comes at a time when social workers are under pressure from the government to abandon rules which have meant that adopted children can be placed only with new families of the same ethnic or cultural background			0
the doctrine has been blamed for preventing ethnic minority children from being adopted by a stable family , because there are two few people from ethnic minorities are willing to adopt. four children of the @entity9 family were taken into care last year while the family were living in a four - bedroom house in @entity23 arranged for them by a charity			2

' but sir @entity35 rejected their pleas , saying : ‘ the children ’s welfare needs outweigh the impact that adoption would have on their @entity9 identity			2
’ he said the future of the two boys should be finally settled by judges at the @entity143 in @entity144			2
