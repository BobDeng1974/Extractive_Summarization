fashion designer @entity0 has broken the @entity3 's @entity2 shoe after creating a 73 inch model of his brand 's popular $ 225 @entity6 heel			1
the 60 - year - old fashion veteran was enlisted by today show correspondent @entity9 , who earlier this year confessed that breaking a world record was on her bucket list			0
' after i listed ' i want to break a world record ' on my bucket list , i search the @entity16 site , to see what record i could possibly break , ' @entity18 , 38 , said on the show			0
' you know , i 'm not the tallest person , i 'm not the shortest person , i do n't have the longest finger nails - but i do know shoes			0
' footwear in and of itself might be one of the most difficult products to bring to market because it 's not just about designing , ' @entity0 told the @entity47			1
' it 's about engineering and it 's about sculpting , and ultimately it has to be a perfect proportion in order for it to fit and hold the weight of its inhabiter			1
and then to take it and change its scale is an even greater feat. ' @entity0 and @entity18 's mammoth @entity6 replica , which was verified by an official @entity32 on thursday , trampled all over the former record , which was set in 1996 by @entity64 of @entity65 with a replica pump measuring 44 inches high and 72 inches long			1
but it was n't an easy feat finding enough materials to create the statuesque @entity6 statue ; the bootie is made from 6,000 sq ft of calfskin and hand - cut foam , while the buckle was created with a @entity76 printer , and the design even comes complete with a fully functional zipper			1
@entity79 and large : the replica shoe weighs almost 150 times the original @entity82 design ' i ’ve never had kids , but i feel like i just had one , ' @entity18 admitted			1
' it was stressful , exhilarating , random			0
it was a real labor of love			0
' the whole shoe weighs a whopping 150 pounds , nearly 150 times the original wearable version currently on sale on the @entity0 website			2
' we met with ten different shoe builders because it is not easy to find somebody to build [ this ] , ' @entity18 said			2
' there are lots of shoe makers , but there are not many shoe builders , ' @entity0 added			2
the shoe is currently on display at department store @entity104 ’s flagship on @entity106 in @entity107 .			0

the shoe is a copy of the designer 's popular $ 225 ' @entity6 ' bootie
it is 73 inches tall and *77* inches long
