@entity3 , 49 , was milking his cows when sheep farmer @entity4 came into his garden and fired at his dog @entity5 with a shotgun			1
mr @entity3 ran to help his black and white dog but she died outside his farmhouse in @entity23 , @entity24 , before he could summon help a court heard			1
police arrested mr @entity4 , 51 , who claimed he had earlier seen @entity5 attacking one of his ewes and decided to shoot the dog dead to protect his flock			1
it was claimed pellets from mr @entity4 ’s gun had also smashed a window and become embedded in mr @entity3 ’s wallpaper			1
at @entity37 magistrates court , mr @entity4 was cleared of trespassing with a shotgun			1
chairman of the bench @entity41 said : ' this has been a difficult case with many grey areas			0
it ’s not in dispute you were in land in possession of a shotgun and you found a dead sheep with the dog in the vicinity			2
' you had strayed from a public footpath thus trespassing			0
however given the lead up you had reasonable excuse			1
' today mr @entity3 , a tenant at the farm for 11 years , said : ' i ’m just so disappointed with the verdict and it just sends out a message for people to go onto other people ’s property armed with a shotgun and shoot their animals			1
' i do n’t believe for one minute my @entity5 mauled that sheep			1
she could not have had the physical strength to drag a ewe down by its throat			0
@entity5 was n’t a big dog and she did not kill that ewe			2
' he added : ' @entity5 was not only my pet dog but my best friend and she has been by my side for seven years			2
' yet he just went out of his way to shoot her without telling me what happened first			0
he did n’t have to kill her			0
' my frustration is that only two people know what happened - me and him			0
it ’s difficult because it ’s one word against another			0
' the incident occurred on november 18 last year when mr @entity3 , who lived alone , was in his milking parlour and heard two shots outside			1
he left the parlour to see gunsmoke , his dog lying dead on the lawn , and mr @entity4 stood at the end of a silage clamp			1
shot dead : @entity5 who was killed after she allegedly mauled a sheep - a claim her owner @entity4 denied shooting : @entity3 's farmhouse in @entity37 , @entity24 , where his dog was shot dead by his trespassing neighbour @entity4 he said : ' it was about 8am and i heard two loud blasts - i thought something had exploded in the house but when i ran outside i saw the gun smoke and smelled the cordite			1
' i looked up and saw someone walking away with a shotgun - and there was @entity5 lying flat near the fence			2
i thought , what the hell is she lying like that for ? it was as if she was asleep			0
damage : a smashed window at @entity3 's farm which he claims was broken when his dog was killed ' i went up and then i realised she was dead - i could n’t believe it			1
' i did see @entity5 in the field earlier but think she was just sniffing the ewe - which i think had been dead for a while			2
she certainly was n’t killing the animal			0
' if she had been viciously attacking the ewe she would have been a mess - she would have had blood round her mouth and fleece stuck to her - but there was n’t any			0
' i asked him what he was doing carrying a loaded shotgun and he said he always does			0
' even if my dog had done this			0
i said i would have paid him back twice over but he said : " they all say that "			0
it was as if he did n’t give a damn			0
' if there had been an @entity150 on my land and i followed it to the nearest residential area and shot it in someone ’s garden , i ’m sure i would be locked in jail straight away			0
i feel like the one being punished here			0
i miss @entity5 so much			2
' mr @entity4 , of @entity158 , @entity159 , told the court he saw the dog attacking the sheep as he drove past the field in his @entity164 and resorted to shooting the hound to protect his flock - which the law allows farmers to do			1
he said he opened fire on the dog whilst it was in the field then followed and shot it once more to ' finish it off ” as the injured animal struggled up a bank on mr @entity3 ’s land			1
in court his lawyer @entity177 said : ' mr @entity4 did n’t take any pleasure from this			1
he followed the dog and despatched it to stop it killing his sheep and to stop its pain			2
” mr @entity4 himself said : ' i could see the dog on the sheep and the first thing i did was shoot it between the shoulder and ear			1
' i was always led to believe a dog could be shot after worrying livestock - especially on my land			2
' at the end of the day , it ’s over with and i just want to draw a line under it			0
i ’m a commercial sheep farmer , i am not proud of it , we have an on - going problem with losing sheep because of dogs attacking - the most we lost at one time was 31			0
' anger : @entity3 , who lives alone , and runs a dairy , said one of the shotgun pellets smashed a window during the attack when his dog was killed			2

@entity3 , 49 , was milking his cows when farmer @entity214 ' @entity4 shot dead his collie @entity5
' @entity12 ' claimed the animal had mauled one of his sheep and he was protecting his flock
magistrates clear mr @entity4 of trespassing with a gun and say he had a ' reasonable excuse '
mr @entity3 denies his dog killed a sheep
