by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 06:36 est , 12 december 2012 @entity2 's representative on @entity3 will soon be spreading his holy message via @entity5 he already has 1.2 billion ' followers ' in the standard sense of the word but the @entity9 now has another type after entering what for any 85 - year old is the brave new world of the social media site			1
it was today announced that @entity9 @entity16 's official handle on @entity5 will be @ @entity17 and within hours of the account going live this morning , the feed had attracted more than 70,000 followers			1
spiritual : most of the tweets will be updates on his weekly general audience , sunday blessings and homilies on major @entity28 holidays pope @entity16 will begin tweeting from december 12 , with regular tweets in eight languages from the account even though the @entity9 will not begin tweeting until december 12 , the feast of the @entity34 , he is already trending			1
@entity35 , senior media advisor to the @entity36 said @ @entity17 is appropriate for a number of reasons			1
' the handle is a good one			2
it means " pope " and it also means " bridge builder " , ' he said			1
' the @entity9 wants to reach out to everyone , ' he told a news conference			1
the first papal tweets will be answers to questions sent to @ @entity49			2
the tweets will be going out in @entity58 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity50			0
other languages will be added in the future			0
livery : the official account features @entity36 livery and images of the city state , as well as the @entity9 's signature ' we are going to get a spiritual message			1
the @entity9 is not going to be walking around with a @entity69 or an @entity70 and no one is going to be putting words into the @entity9 's mouth			1
he will tweet what he wants to tweet , ' @entity35 said			0
primarily the tweets will come from the contents of his weekly general audience , sunday blessings and homilies on major @entity28 holidays			0
they will also include reaction to major world events , such as natural disasters			0
@entity16 will be sending his first tweet himself on december 12 but in the future most will be written by aides and he will sign off on them before they are sent in his name			1
but while the @entity9 will be one of the world 's most high - profile tweeters and have many followers , he will not be following anyone himself			1
the @entity9 's @entity5 page is designed in yellow and white - the colours of the @entity36 , with a backdrop of the @entity36 and his picture			2
it may change during different liturgical seasons of the year and when he is away from the @entity36 on trips			0
the @entity36 said precautions had been taken to make sure the @entity9 's certified account is not hacked			1
only one computer in the @entity36 's secretariat of state will be used for the tweets			0
pope @entity16 blessed the possibilities of social media last year but warned it can lead to isolation ' the @entity9 's presence on @entity5 is a concrete expression of his conviction that the @entity28 must be present in the digital arena , ' the @entity36 said			2
' this initiative is best understood in the context of his reflections on the importance of the cultural space that has been brought into being by the new technologies ... the @entity9 's presence on @entity5 can be seen as the ' tip of the iceberg ' that is the @entity28 's presence in the world of new media , ' it said in a statement			2
a few internet wags wryly observed the announcement			0
writer @entity127 , who has more than 330,000 followers , tweeted : ' so pleased i have more followers than @entity131 )			0
he did only join ten minutes ago , but , still ! i 'm bigger than the pope ! ' the @entity9 , who still writes his speeches and books by hand , has given a qualified blessing to social networking			2
in a document issued last year , he said the possibilities of new media and social networks offered ' a great opportunity ' , but warned of the risks of depersonalisation , alienation , self - indulgence , and the dangers of having more virtual friends than real ones			0
the @entity36 decided against using a personal @entity152 page for the pope because they thought it was too personal an interaction and would require more manpower to keep updated			0
in 2009 , a new @entity36 website , www.pope2you.net , went live , offering an application called ' the @entity9 meets you on @entity152 " , and another allowing the faithful to see the pontiff 's speeches and messages on their iphones or ipods			1
the @entity36 famously got egg on its face in 2009 when it was forced to admit that , if it had surfed the web more , it might have known that a traditionalist bishop whose excommunication was lifted had for years been a @entity172 denier .			0

the official account went live today and was *deluged* with followers
the @entity9 will begin tweeting on december 12
@ @entity17 handle means both ' @entity9 ' and ' bridge builder '
