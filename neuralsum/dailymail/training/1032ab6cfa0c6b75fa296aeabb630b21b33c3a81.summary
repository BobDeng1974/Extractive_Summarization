@entity1 ’s much - hyped debut as an @entity3 reporter last night was today slammed as ' monochromatic ' , ' nervous ' and showing ' no charisma '			1
the 31 - year - old former first daughter chatted with @entity7 host @entity6 on the @entity3 sofa and did a segment on a non-profit organisation			1
some reviewers gave her the benefit of the doubt for first - night nerves but one suggested she could be ‘ one of the most boring people of her era ’			1
she said : ' for most of my life , i did deliberately lead a private life and inadvertently led a public life			1
' she credited her late grandmother , @entity37 , for convincing her to come out of the shadows and into the spotlight , reported @entity40			1
miss @entity1 said : ' she recently had been cajoling me and challenging me to do more with my life , to lead a more of purposely public life			2
' @entity42 ... seems like a very nice young woman			2
she is obviously bright , although we already suspected she was that as well			2
otherwise , there was nothing else that necessarily dismissed charges ( mostly by tv critics , although they were not alone ) that she got this job because of that name ' ( @entity53 , @entity54 ) ' the former first daughter appeared poised and well - prepared , though a bit nervous ' ( @entity57 , @entity40 ) ' @entity58 does n’t " pop " off the screen , to use an industry term - her demeanour is reserved , she does n’t project her voice like a broadcaster			1
not that most viewers probably cared ' ( @entity65 , @entity66 ) ' what was surprising to see on monday night ’s show is how someone can be on tv in such a prominent way and , in her big moment , display so very little charisma - none at all			2
either we ’re spoiled by tv ’s unlimited population of giant personalities or this woman is one of the most boring people of her era ' ( @entity75 , @entity82 ) chat : miss @entity1 was filmed making cornbread and interviewing founder @entity85 , left , about the 500 children and young adults they serve interviews : sources say @entity58 's debut did n't go off as well as expected and she may not resign again ‘ ( she said ) that being @entity1 had happened to me and that i had a responsibility to do something with that asset and opportunity			0
' ' for most of my life , i did deliberately lead a private life and inadvertently led a public life ' @entity1 her report was a feel - good piece from the @entity25 in the poverty - stricken @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			1
