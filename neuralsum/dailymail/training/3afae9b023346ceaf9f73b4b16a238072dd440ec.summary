by @entity0 published : 18:41 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 10 july 2013 worrying : hundreds of health service managers have pocketed pay - offs of up to £ 500,000 - but many have walked straight into new jobs in the @entity5			1
reforms were ordered in 2010 by the then health secretary @entity7 , pictured hundreds of health service managers have pocketed pay - offs of up to £ 500,000 – but many have walked straight into new jobs in the @entity5 , a report reveals today			1
since 2010 , the @entity5 has spent £ 430 million on redundancy packages for staff of departments scrapped under the coalition ’s health reforms			1
but more than a fifth of those supposedly no longer needed have already found new jobs within the health service , and thousands more could follow			1
they have exploited rules which mean they have to wait only four weeks before they can take a new post			1
the @entity25 report shows that one unnamed boss was handed a redundancy package worth £ 578,470 while hundreds of others received payments of more than £ 200,000			2
but the @entity30 has refused to name any of these individuals – despite previously promising to be more open and transparent – claiming it would breach confidentiality rules			2
last night the ‘ jobs @entity36 ’ was attacked by critics of public sector waste			2
the report has been published just a week after another @entity25 study revealed how the @entity39 broke its own rules in negotiating bumper pay - offs for departing staff			1
@entity5 reforms were ordered in 2010 by the then health secretary @entity7 in a bid to cut the number of managers and give more power to doctors and nurses			1
they resulted in the abolition of hundreds of regional @entity5 bureaucracies , such as primary care trusts and strategic health authorities , and the creation of gp - led organisations called clinical commissioning groups			1
but many senior doctors and other health professionals warned that the shake - up would cost the @entity5 vast amounts of money which would be diverted away from patient care			1
today ’s report reveals that the reforms have so far cost the taxpayer £ 1.1billion , which included £ 435million on redundancy payments			2
a total of 10,095 employees have been made redundant since may 2010 , each receiving an average pay - out of £ 43,095			2
but these figures do not take into account the redundancies in april when the reforms were officially implemented and many organisations were abolished			2
expensive : since 2010 , the @entity5 has spent £ 430million on redundancy packages for staff of departments scrapped under the coalition 's health reforms the @entity30 has admitted the total cost of the reforms may rise to £ 1.7billion , including £ 680million in pay - outs			1
it claims that the reforms will ultimately save the @entity5 £ 2.4billion in slashing unnecessary bureaucracy – although the report says it can not confirm if this is the case			1
but the report also points out that since the reforms , although 171 bodies were abolished , 240 were set up in their place – meaning there are now 70 more compared to three years ago			0
the report also points out that 9 per cent of the 45,350 newly created posts have not yet been filled , meaning that more than 4,000 axed managers could walk straight into new jobs			0
hospitals and @entity5 organisations have been ordered to make £ 20billion of savings by next year so that budgets can be re-invested in better care for the elderly and more advanced treatments			1
but in the face of such strict targets , many trusts have resorted to sacking nurses and other frontline staff , and rationing drugs and operations			0
@entity110 of the @entity111 ’ @entity109 said : ‘ health chiefs have wasted a breathtaking amount of taxpayers ’ money on pay - offs when axeing staff			2
‘ the size of the pay - outs , particularly those handed to senior managers , appear to have been allowed to spiral out of control			0
laying off staff at great expense to taxpayers only to hire them back is unacceptable			0
‘ this is all too typical of the @entity127 that needlessly costs taxpayers a fortune			0
’ @entity130 mp , @entity131 ’s shadow health minister , said : ‘ this report lifts the lid on the government ’s shambolic re-organisation of the @entity5			1
since @entity137 entered @entity138 over 4,000 nursing posts have been axed and one in ten hospitals are now short - staffed			0
ministers are taking unacceptable risks with standards of patient care			0
’ dr @entity145 , chairman of the council of the @entity147 , which represents doctors , said : ‘ the findings of the @entity25 echo many of our concerns about how the @entity5 reforms were devised and implemented			1
‘ introducing radical changes to how the @entity5 is run and structured during a period of intense financial pressure has been a costly distraction to solving the real challenges facing the health service			1
‘ all the evidence is pointing to a worsening financial situation for the @entity5 , and the government needs to urgently rethink its approach			2
‘ most of the savings have come from pay freezes and cuts in the tariffs for services , but this is neither sustainable or likely to deliver the long - term savings that are needed to protect patient services			0
’ a @entity30 spokeswoman said : ‘ the changes made as a result of the reforms mean a huge net gain for the taxpayer			0
they will save £ 5.5billion during this @entity177 and £ 1.5billion every year thereafter , to be reinvested back into patient care			0
‘ we have put doctors and nurses in the driving seat			0
they are best placed to take decisions about care for their patients – decisions that were previously taken by managers			0
' they now have the freedom , power and budget to make sure their local communities get the care and services they really need			0
’ thousands of patients ’ confidential medical records are being lost by @entity5 staff every year , figures show			1
files containing highly personal information have been mistakenly left in drains , hospital car parks and even branches of @entity205			0
freedom of information requests show that hospitals made 2,805 confidentiality breaches in the past 12 months – a 20 per cent rise on the previous year			0
in one example , at @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity213 , a letter informing a patient they had cancer was left in the car park .			0

@entity5 has spent £ 430m on staff of departments scrapped under reforms
but more than a fifth have already found new jobs within the health service
rules mean they have to wait only four weeks before taking new post
