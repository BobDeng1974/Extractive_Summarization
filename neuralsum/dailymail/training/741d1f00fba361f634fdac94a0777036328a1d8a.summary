by @entity0 published : 15:06 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 6 december 2013 new rules : the government has unveiled plans to crack down on councils using ' aggressive ' parking fine tactics to rake in money from motorists new plans to crack down on ' heavy handed and aggressive ' parking enforcement by councils who rake in £ 1.3billion a year from motorists were unveiled by the government today			1
it includes giving drivers a decent ' grace period ' of up to five minutes before imposing a ticket , stopping @entity17 being used for on - street enforcement , a review of double yellow lines and cracking down on parking fines being used to subsidise other council spending			1
ministers are also proposing a 25 per cent discount on fines for motorists who pay within seven days of losing an appeal			0
also , penalty charge fines are to be frozen for the rest of this @entity30 ‘ with immediate effect ’ and all councils will be required to make clear in their annual reports exactly how much money is raised from parking ‘ and where that revenue goes ’			1
the plans to tackle ‘ aggressive parking policies ’ which ‘ blight ’ the nation ’s high streets are set out by communities secretary @entity42 and transport secretary @entity43 in a new consultation document published on friday			2
it says councils should act in a ‘ fair and proportionate ’ manner ’ but cites evidence that many do not			0
use of @entity17 is ‘ no longer proportionate ’ so : ‘ the government therefore intends to put an end to this practice			2
’ the @entity54 notes ‘ increasing concerns ’ about the direction of some council parking policies and says : ’ these steps will make it cheaper and easier to park , encourage people to shop locally and help with the cost of living			0
' the main policy changes include limiting the use of @entity17 for on – street parking enforcement ' in some or all circumstances ’			1
the consultation asks people to consider whether there should be a statutory requirement for local authorities to allow a ‘ grace period ’ where a driver has over-stayed in a paid for parking place for a short period before they are lowed to issue a parking ticket			1
to ensure transparency , councils should be forced to publish annual parking - charge reports to show where revenue comes from and where it is being used it also considers allowing communities and businesses to be given the right to require authorities to review aspects of their parking strategies : ‘ this includes the level of parking charges , whether parking should be free for a time , and whether double yellow lines are appropriate and necessary at particular locations			1
’ parking enforcement guidance should emphasise ‘ a less heavy - handed approach ’ to parking enforcement			1
parking charges and fines ‘ should not be used to subsidise other areas of local government spending ’ , it adds			2
more than eight million parking tickets were issued by local councils in @entity102 in 2011 - 12 , said the government			1
support : @entity106 president @entity105 welcomed the measures - particular the five minute ' grace period ' the report notes how total parking revenues have more than doubled from £ 608million in 1997 - 8 to £ 1.3billion in 2010 - 11			1
profits from parking also soared from £ 223million to £ 512million in the same period			2
and income form parking is set to increase by 5.6 per cent from £ 601million to £ 635million in the 12 months to 2013 - 14			2
the report says : ’ local authorities need to ensure that appropriate parking spaces are available , that signs and road markings are clear , that parking charges are reasonable and attractive to use the town centre , and that enforcement is fair and proportionate			2
’ it adds : ’ the government is aware of concerns that some local authorities appear not to be using their powers to meet the best interests of road users			0
’ transport secretary @entity43 said : ‘ @entity130 parking fines blight the use of our high streets and force shoppers out of towns			0
‘ we want to rein back aggressive rules by banning the use of @entity17 for parking enforcement , reviewing the use of yellow lines , and giving shoppers a " grace period " to get back to their car after their ticket has run out before they get fined			1
’ he added : ‘ we will also update guidance to emphasise a less heavy - handed approach to parking enforcement and to reinforce that charges and fines can not be used as a means to raise cash			1
' professor @entity154 , director of the @entity155 said : ‘ the majority of drivers who break parking rules are n’t being malicious or calculating , they have simply made a mistake			0
so now wonder landing them with a hefty fine for a minor infringement breeds resentment			0
‘ the current system actively discourages drivers who have been wrongly penalised from fighting for justice , tempting them instead to pay up quickly to avoid further aggravation and the possibility of a more hefty fine later			0
’ the @entity123 crackdown on dodgy council parking practices comes in the wake of a damning report by the all - party commons ’ @entity174 , many of whose recommendations have been taken up by the government			0
evidence given to that committee led communities secretary @entity42 to rail against councils and complain that drivers were being ‘ ripped off ’ by unfair parking policy over-zealous enforcement			1
’ he said at the time : ‘ over-zealous enforcement is damaging local high streets and shops , as they lose business to out of town superstores and internet retailing			0
' it is a clear abuse of the law that fines have became a cash cow for town hall coffers			0
’ and he has accused councils of ‘ bending the law ‘ to fill their cash - shortfalls with what amounts to a back - door ‘ stealth tax			0
’ evidence to mps from the @entity208 set up by ministers to consider drivers ’ appeals against parking fines revealed concern over the ‘ routine ’ use of cctv cameras to automatically issue motorists with millions of parking fines			2
this flies in the face of current @entity54 guidance which says cctv should only be used when it is impractical to use traffic wardens			0
they also highlighted a failure by wardens to use discretion when drivers			0
@entity106 president @entity105 said : ‘ we welcome the five - minute grace period as many drivers are petrified that rushing into the corner shop for change for the pay & display will cost them dearly			1

plans include giving drivers a ' grace period ' before a parking ticket can be issued and stopping @entity17 being used for on - street enforcement
penalty charge fines are also to be frozen for the rest of this @entity30
all councils will have to show how much money is raised from parking in their annual reports and reveal exactly where the revenue is spent
