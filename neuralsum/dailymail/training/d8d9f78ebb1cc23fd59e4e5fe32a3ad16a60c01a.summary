the days of ordering delicacies such as moules marinières could be numbered , as climate change threatens to change the acidity of the oceans			0
researchers at @entity6 discovered mussel shells become increasingly brittle when they are formed in more acidic water , leaving the creatures more vulnerable to predators			1
and the news comes after reports found the changes in an ocean ’s ph levels can make shrimps and prawns taste more sour			2

the acidity of the world ’s oceans is changing as they absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide , which contributes to climate change the acidity of the world ’s oceans is changing as they absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide , which contributes to climate change			0
the water reacts with the carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid , which is expected to drop levels from @entity33 today , to @entity34 by the end of the 21st century			0
marine biologists recently found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water			2
they warn that as the acidity of the planet 's oceans changes , due to rising carbon dioxide levels , many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising			0
the researchers put hundreds of northern shrimp @entity48 into two tanks of water for three weeks			0
they were either placed in sea water with a ph of 8 , or in a more acidic tank with a ph of 7.5			2
decreased ph reduced the score significantly for appearance and taste , but not for texture			0
shrimp raised in the waters with the lower ph were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting , while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest			2
also the 63 per cent of the shrimp from the acidic water died during the three weeks			2
mussels ’ shells are made of calcium carbonate and organic material created by the shellfish through a process known as biomineralisation			1
they draw bicarbonate ions from seawater , and use proteins in their bodies to make crystals of calcium carbonate to form their two - layer shells			1
the shell ’s outer later is composed of calcite , while the inner layer is made of aragonite			0
in acidic water , there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for the mussels to make these shells			1
the researchers , whose findings were published in the @entity94 ’s journal interface , altered temperature and ph levels for common blue mussels in lab tanks			0
this was designed to simulate four different levels of acidity predicted to occur in oceans over the coming decades			0
study leader doctor @entity103 , of @entity6 ’s @entity104 , said : ‘ what we ’ve found in the lab is that increased levels of acidification in their habitats have a negative impact on mussels ’ ability to create their shells			2
‘ we worked with colleagues in our @entity117 to examine the toughness of the shells of the mussels in the more acidic water against those in control conditions			1
‘ what we found was that the calcite outer shells of the mussels past a certain threshold of acidity was stiffer and harder , making it more brittle and prone to fracture under pressure , and the aragonite inner shell became softer			0
mussels draw bicarbonate ions from seawater and use proteins in their bodies to make crystals of calcium carbonate to form their shells			1
in acidic water , there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for the mussels to make these shells			1
this effect , however , was reduced when temperatures increased by 2 ° @entity146 ) ‘ this could mean that mussels growing in the wild in the future could be more vulnerable to attack from predators , as well as from the effect of ocean forces			1
’ the researchers continued that because blue mussels are commonly eaten by humans , these changes could also have an effect on the yields of mussels available for the fishing industry			0
this effect , however , was reduced when the temperature of the water was increased by @entity166 ( 35 ° f )			1
this might suggest the mussels are reverting to ancestral evolutionary mechanisms to mitigate the effects of increased acidity , continued dr @entity103			0
she added : ‘ we ’re planning to continue our research in this area in the future and expand its scope to look at the effects of more acidic water on the shells of other marine organisms including oysters and abalone			1

mussel shells are made of calcium carbonate and organic material
they draw bicarbonate ions from seawater to build these shells
shellfish then use body proteins to make crystals of calcium carbonate
in more acidic water , there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for shells
this could make them more vulnerable to attack and could wipe them out
this effect , however , was reduced when the temperature of the water was increased by 2 ° @entity146 )
