by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 09:21 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 20:45 est , 19 november 2012 @entity4 ’s lawyers were last night negotiating with @entity5 for damages over the broadcast in which this morning host @entity8 presented the prime minister with a list of alleged paedophiles			1
the conservative peer ’s legal team is looking for ‘ substantially more ’ than the £ 185,000 it has already agreed with the @entity15 for the @entity18 ’s botched @entity17 investigation			1
libel claims have a ‘ practical ceiling ’ of around £ 200,000 if they reach court			2
but @entity5 will be keen to avoid an expensive legal battle and could agree an even higher settlement taking into account @entity4 ’s costs			1
some of the names were briefly visible to viewers			0
@entity4 ’s lawyers argue those who did not see the names could have gone to the internet and quickly found the false allegations linking him to child abuse			1
@entity50 , @entity51 's solicitor , said in doing so the experienced presenter ' embarrassed the prime minister and destroyed the reputation of my client ' and has sent a 15 - page letter before action to @entity5 encouraging them to settle			1
an @entity5 source told @entity60 that they received the letter on thursday and will respond to it today - within the 48 - hour - deadline set out in the paperwork			1
lawyers said the @entity4 , pictured , case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in @entity70 legal history the former @entity72 treasurer has said because the @entity15 is publicly - funded he tempered the claim made against them			1
but because @entity5 is a private company he is looking for a huge damages deal , it has emerged			1
a source close to the peer told @entity60 : ' @entity4 is suing @entity5 and he would be looking for substantially more damages than the £ 185,000 he got from the @entity15 because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer - funded			1
' up to £ 500,000 is what they are looking at			2
' @entity84 , pictured , could face legal action after mentioning false child abuse allegations against @entity4 meanwhile comedian @entity84 is the latest celebrity to face the possibility of a lawsuit for falsely naming @entity72 peer @entity4 on @entity90 in connection with child abuse claims			1
the @entity94 star joins a growing number of potential defendants facing libel action which lawyers think could swell to 10,000 – the largest in @entity70 legal history			1
@entity84 tweeted after a @entity17 programme earlier this month which speculated about the identity of a senior conservative accused of child abuse			1
the report did not name 70 - year - old @entity4			1
but social networking sites were quickly awash with his name			0
it later emerged he had been falsely accused			0
@entity84 , 46 , tweeted to his 440,000 followers : ‘ any clues as to who this @entity72 paedophile is ... ? ’ he then retweeted a response naming @entity4			1
@entity84 , who appears on @entity114 , refused to comment yesterday			1
others who tweeted the peer ’s name include @entity118 , wife of commons speaker @entity119			0
she tweeted to her 59,000 followers on november 4 : ‘ why is @entity4 trending ? * innocent face *			1
’ on friday she tweeted : ‘ yes had letter from @entity124			0
his lawyers ambulance chasers tbh [ to be honest ] # bigbullies			2
’ @entity15 controversy : @entity4 announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after @entity15 's @entity17 broadcast the wrong claims mistake : @entity118 took to @entity90 to comment on speculation as to the identity of the @entity72 at the centre of a @entity17 investigation and could be sued she later added : ‘ i do n’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire			1
lord @entity140 falsely accused but not by me			0
‘ loving my trial by tabloid , mind			0
i never said @entity4 paedophile – just noted he trending			1
nor did i tweet about * that * @entity17			0
this is totally politically motivated , i tell you			0
and i do n’t do conspiracy theories as a rule			0
’ she went on : ‘ night twitter			0
off to cuddle up with my lovely husband who takes so much * * * * ( often on my behalf ) # poor @entity119 # topspeaker # greatmanontoast			0
’ the peer ’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘ original ’ tweets and a further 9,000 retweets , which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them			1
about 40 of these potential defendants have so far approached the peer ’s lawyers to apologise			1
mr @entity50 previously warned that tweeters , even those who deleted their accounts or messages , will be contacted so should come forward			0
he added that it was time to clamp down on @entity90 , which allowed people to say ' vile , disgusting ' things			0
' we have been inundated by the public who have wanted us to deal with this problem of @entity90 , and have encouraged and in some cases have actually offered us funds			2
' @entity90 is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity			0
' we 've been watching people who have been taking down what they put on @entity90			0
what they do n't seem to understand is that once it 's there , you ca n't take it down and what 's more we really have all the information , ' he said			2
' not only do we have it , but we have managed to find a couple of firms of experts who are able to produce the pre-tweets , the post-tweets , the effect of the tweets and the re-tweets			2
' so what starts as a sort of maybe one ( recipient ) ends up as 100,000 or more in some cases			0
' @entity90 says information about its users that is not public will not be revealed unless they are legally required to do so			2
@entity90 adds that to obtain information that is not public – including the full name of the @entity90 user and their address - would require a witness summons , a court order or another valid legal process			2
without any of these , only the @entity90 user ’s id – which could be a pseudonym – and any other information they have willing disclosed will be available			0
@entity4 could now apply for an order which would enable them to obtain the private details of users who tweeted about him			2
@entity218 , a privacy lawyer , said : ‘ in the case of @entity4 , the mere seriousness of the libel would mean applying for a court order would be a straightforward application			2
’ his legal team plans to make each of them pay a nominal sum of possibly £ 5 to a children ’s charity			1
@entity4 is not expected to treat people such as @entity118 in the same way			2
her lawyers approached his legal team last week but were given short shrift			1
a friend of the peer was reported to have said : ‘ they tried to say she did n’t really mean any harm			0
we ’ve sent them a letter before action			0
