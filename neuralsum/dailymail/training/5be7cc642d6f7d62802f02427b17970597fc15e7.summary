medics travel from @entity7 to camps in the heart of the vast sands to harvest kidneys , livers , corneas and corneas from the helpless donors			1
they then transport the organs back to @entity17 in mobile refrigeration units where patients are waiting to receive them			1
lawless : tens of thousands of refugees from @entity22 try to flee across the @entity3 desert to enter @entity24 thousands of refugees are believed to have died as a result of the operations , their bodies bearing tell - tale scars which show where the organs have been removed			1
the illegal trade – believed to be the second most lucrative in the region behind weapons smuggling – has been exposed in a @entity36 documentary			1
@entity37 , part of the network ’s @entity38 , reveals the plight of refugees from @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 crossing the @entity3 in an attempt to reach @entity24			1
@entity46 : this man 's body appears to show scars after his organs had been removed tribe crime : members of the @entity54 tribes are apparently responsible for the organ - snatching ( stock image of three bedouin tribesmen ) according to the report , refugees also face rape , extortion and slavery and are frequently held in labour camps in the lawless desert			1
the @entity3 is under the control of @entity54 tribes , and police rarely ever venture into the area			1
smuggling and contraband is the main economy and when refugees put their trust into smugglers to get them across the border , they are instead being sold to the @entity54 and taken to labour camps			1
on assignment : journalist @entity77 uncovers the claims of organ harvesting in the @entity36 documentary : ' @entity81 ' organ trafficking : journalist @entity77 ( right ) interviews @entity84 about organ harvesting ( left ) instead of making it to the @entity24 border , they are held by the tribes – including the @entity90 - who try to extort huge sums of money from relatives they might have overseas			1

both sexes are usually enslaved and may have to work on marijuana plantations in the depths of the @entity102 also face the terrible prospect of having their organs harvested			1
‘ doctors from @entity7 call me and say they have a private case and they need this or that , ’ one @entity54 chief told @entity36 journalist @entity77			2
‘ it ’s like spare parts for a car			2
the doctors come with some sort of mobile fridge where the organs can be stored for six to eight hours and resold in @entity7 or elsewhere			2
‘ they deal directly with the @entity120 tribe and they buy the organs for anything from 1,000 to 20,000 dollars ’ the documentary crew was shown photographs of dead bodies laced with the scars from surgery by @entity128 , the head of the @entity129			2
‘ a few years ago i heard from one of the bedouins about spare parts , ’ he said			2
photographic evidence : the documentary reveals shocking photographs of refugees sold to the @entity54 by smugglers ‘ but i could n’t accept at that time , whether it is true or not			1
it is not logical for me because the spare body parts need high technology and special clinics			2
‘ but i did n’t know the technology has become very easy now because of mobile clinics			2
