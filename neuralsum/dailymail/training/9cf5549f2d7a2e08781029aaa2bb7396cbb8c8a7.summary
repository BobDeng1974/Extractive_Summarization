the @entity0 , @entity1 when millionaire property developer @entity4 popped the question to actress @entity6 three years ago , little did he know he was helping to unleash a side unheard of in the @entity9 male : the hopeless romantic			1
his proposal - on a beach in the @entity13 with the words , ' will you marry me ' written in fire - suddenly became the benchmark against which all proposals would be judged			1
it was also the proposal that changed the lives of two friends - @entity2 and @entity1			1
walking through @entity22 one day , they spotted a chap who , hoping to pull off a candy - style proposal yet lacking the funds , had armed himself with dozens of tea lights with which he spelt out , ' make me the happiest man in the world ' for his girlfriend			1
' it was lovely , ' says @entity32 , ' except it was so windy the lights kept blowing out and he 'd misspelled “ happiest ”			2
so we helped him out			2
when he said , " i do n't know what i 'd have done without you , " a light bulb went off in our heads			0
' that moment two years ago led to @entity32 , 33 , and @entity1 , 32 , setting up the @entity43 - @entity42 's first bespoke marriage proposal company			1
their exploits are captured in a new series which follows men as they try to come up with the most poignant proposal to spring on their girlfriend			1
the chaps , largely , look terrified , the women shell - shocked , and it all makes for highly entertaining tv			0
' before it was fine for men to go down on one knee , ' says @entity1 , a former advertising executive , ' but people want more of a story now			1
they want to tell their mates about how they did something a bit crazy			0
' that 's one way to describe 35 - year - old property investor @entity66 's proposal to girlfriend @entity67			2
having been given a blank cheque , the @entity0 organise a @entity70 dress and @entity72 bag to be delivered , before a trip by @entity74 , speedboat and helicopter to a chapel where @entity66 waits with a gospel choir to sing the @entity80 wedding scene from @entity67 's favourite film , @entity82			1
@entity83 proposes to @entity84 with a flash mob on @entity87 's @entity86 ' he said @entity67 wanted to know what it felt like to be a celebrity , ' says @entity32			0
other proposals are more simple			0
@entity83 , a 23 - year - old actor - director , pops the question to his girlfriend @entity84 on @entity87 's @entity86 with a flash mob of singers performing @entity97 's @entity96			0
some men simply need saving from themselves			2
' one guy wanted to take his girlfriend to a restaurant , excuse himself and then return dressed as the @entity102 from @entity103 and sing her a song from the movie , ' says @entity32			0
' we asked him if his girlfriend would like it and he said , " no , she 's really shy			0
" then we asked if she liked @entity103 and he said no , but it was his favourite film , and when we asked him if he could even sing , he said , “ not really , i 'm terrible			0
” luckily , we managed to persuade him to propose over a picnic in @entity22 instead			0
