by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 9 july 2013 @entity1 will begin to operate the world 's first floating nuclear power plant in just three years time			1
the specially - made ship with a nuclear power plant on - board will provide energy , heat and drinking water to relatively inaccessible areas of the vast country			1
the director of @entity1 's largest shipbuilders , the @entity14 , announced that the unique ship should be operational by 2016 at the 6th @entity16 in @entity17			0
in three years , @entity1 will have the world 's first floating nuclear power plant			1
the @entity20 is to become the first of a series of floating nuclear power plants , which @entity1 plans to put into mass - production the first ship will be called @entity20 and is intended to be the first of small fleet of floating nuclear plants in @entity1			1
it is designed to provide energy to big industrial companies , cut - off port cities and offshore oil and gas platforms			2
the ship 's power - generating capabilities were based on nuclear reactors which are already on - board ice breaker ships in the chilly region that have operated successfully for over half a century			0
the @entity20 will weigh 21,500 tons and have a crew of 69 people			0
but it will not have a propulsion system so will have to be towed to the location where it is needed , according to global news service , @entity45 it will have two modified @entity48 reactors that will be able to provide enough energy for a city with 200,000 people			2
together the reactors will generate @entity53 of electricity or 300 mw of heat			0

it will weigh 21,500 tons and have a crew of 69 people but will have to be towed to the location where it is needed @entity1 's large towns and ports along its northern coastline and its far eastern regions are currently not experiencing much economic growth , partly because of a lack of energy , so it is hoped that these floating power stations will help the situation			1
the country could also use them near areas of mineral deposits and military bases outside the country			0
the floating power plants will be able to be modified and be used as a desalination plant			2
this means that the ship could produce a staggering 240,000 cubic metres of fresh water every day			1
a total of 15 countries have expressed an interest in using floating power stations , including : @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
the ship builder insists that the process of fuel enrichment on the floating power station complies with the @entity98 's regulations			1
@entity1 's large towns and ports along its northern coastline and its far eastern regions are currently not experiencing much economic growth , partly because of a lack of energy , so it is hoped that these floating power stations will help the situation			1
the floating power plants will be able to be modified and be used as a desalination plant just like nuclear power stations on land , the floating power plant is designed with a safety margin			1
it is designed to withstand collisions with other ships and land as well as survive a tsunami			0
after 40 years of service , the nuclear reactor will be replaced			0
the firm claims that its floating power station is safe for the environment as it does not release any hazardous substances while it is operating			2
building of the first ship got underway in 2007 at that @entity124 in @entity125			0
it was moved to the @entity14 where it stayed for two years after the money ran out			0
but work on the vessel has got underway again after a financing deal was signed between the @entity14 and a company owned by the @entity1 state in december of last year .			0

floating nuclear power station will provide energy , heat and drinking water to relatively inaccessible areas of @entity1
the ship called @entity20 is planned to be the first of a small fleet of floating power stations
as well as powering cities with up to 200,000 people , the plant can also provide 240,000 cubic metres of fresh water every day
