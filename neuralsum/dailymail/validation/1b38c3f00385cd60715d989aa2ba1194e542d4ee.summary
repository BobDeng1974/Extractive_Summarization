for suffering @entity3 captain @entity2 , it is beginning to feel more like @entity4			1
there has been an increasingly familiar pattern to his addresses in the aftermath of every one of his team ’s four defeats in this @entity14 campaign so far			2
he has talked of the positives to take from each loss while trying his best to put the bravest of faces on matters			0
as he sat at @entity22 on tuesday following a tough training session with his international colleagues , his mask did n’t slip one bit as he went through the same old routine			2
@entity2 in action during the @entity14 rugby match between @entity29 and @entity3 at @entity29 but behind the forced smile it was clear there is a new fear engulfing him which makes the final @entity14 match against @entity35 on saturday an increasingly nervous prospect			1
the scrum - half with 38 caps to his name does n’t want to join @entity41 and @entity42 in the record books as a captain who led @entity3 to a @entity14 wooden spoon			1
@entity41 did it twice , in 2004 and 2007 , with @entity47 suffering a similar fate in 2012			1
since @entity14 became six , @entity49 have been bottom of the pile 10 times with @entity54 and @entity29 finishing last once each			1
@entity55 and @entity35 have never picked up the wooden spoon			1
@entity2 , who played stand - off rather than scrum - half in the side that was whitewashed under @entity47 , does n’t want to experience that feeling again			1
he is hoping his team - mates feel as embarrassed as he is about the current plight and use the fear of failure as motivation to put things right against the @entity67			0
‘ i do n’t know if it hurts me as captain more than the other players , but losing all our games so far certainly hurts me a lot , that ’s for sure , ’ said the 29 - year - old			2
‘ i like to think avoiding the wooden spoon is a big driving factor whether you are captain or not , as nobody wants to be in the team that ’s failed to pick up any wins			1
‘ remember , though , we have n’t finished bottom yet and we ’ve got an opportunity this weekend to finish on a high			1
if we can win this one , it allows us to give a big sigh of relief going into the @entity90 games over the summer and then build towards the @entity91			0
@entity2 leaves the field after the second half of the the @entity14 match between against @entity49 ‘ the other side of the coin is that if we lose this one , it ’s a long time before we play for @entity3 again and that ’s the worst situation to be in			1
at least we have a week to try to rectify some of the problems that were there against @entity55 and give everybody the boost they want by turning things around against @entity35			1
’ @entity2 admitted he has been left totally frustrated at how his side had come up short in all their matches and fallen away badly in the second half of key games			1
although he believes all is not lost , he is clearly growing tired of constantly being the one trying to explain away in public what is going wrong			0
‘ i ’ve almost been saying the same things most weeks , unfortunately , ’ he continued			0
‘ i still believe there are huge positives in there and i think everybody , including ourselves , can see some of the play is brilliant and the players get confidence from that			0
‘ i know the @entity122 boys and the @entity124 boys , in particular , think that we ’re now a threat and a much better team than we were in the past despite the defeats			0
we are getting close to winning but need to do that little bit extra to get over the line			0
‘ of course there are things to look at and , for instance , we ’re getting to half - time in good positions but maybe dropping off slightly , which is something we need to sort			0
video 02 @entity139 : @entity55 v @entity3 match review @entity141 hands off the tackle of @entity2 during the match between @entity55 and @entity3 at @entity144 ‘ looking back at the @entity55 game , that is what happened as there was n’t enough urgency in the early part of the second half and we just let @entity55 come at us			1
there ’s only so much you can soak up before cracking and we ca n’t let that happen again			2
’ @entity156 will have a capacity attendance for the match against @entity35 , with many visiting fans making up the 67,000 crowd			2
@entity67 supporters had bought their tickets within hours of them going on sale on the assumption their team would be challenging for the @entity166			0
a clean sweep is no longer a possibility after their defeat to @entity54 last weekend but , even with tens of thousands inside the stadium cheering on @entity172 ’s title contenders , @entity2 still believes the @entity3 players can be inspired by the atmosphere within @entity22			1
‘ we want to win for the jersey , win for ourselves , win for the fans , because they ’ve been brilliant throughout a tough campaign , ’ he said			0
‘ we can feed off them hugely and want to go out there and give them something back for their continued support			0
we really want to send them off on a good note , because it ’s been a tough championship for the players and fans alike			0
’ @entity2 stands dejected after the final whistle during the @entity14 match at @entity144 a win over @entity35 would indeed have the fans singing a happier tune			1
for that to happen , @entity42 insists there is nothing to be gained from dwelling too much on the results which have brought @entity3 to this precarious position			1
‘ we need to be realistic , look at where we are n’t good enough and try to improve , ’ said the @entity201 hooker , capped 84 times			2
‘ we need to stay positive going into the games and it is a huge positive to know we have pushed good teams close and scored tries against them			0
‘ there is no point getting down as it does n’t get you anywhere on the pitch			2
it ’s about staying positive and getting right back out and going after @entity35			2
‘ it would be great to finish the campaign on a high , especially at home			0
it is a @entity91 year , so it would be a very positive note to end the @entity14 on			0

@entity2 does n’t want to join @entity41 and @entity42
