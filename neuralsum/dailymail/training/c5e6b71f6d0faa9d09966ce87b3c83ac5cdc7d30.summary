@entity58 , medal specialist at @entity44 , said : ‘ the @entity59 is both hugely important and highly emotive			2
i would say it ’s one of the most significant of the great @entity1 because it is the first of the @entity3 , so it was not surprising that it attracted much interest ' private @entity5 was awarded the @entity1 in 1924 for his bravery at @entity25 ' i am delighted the sale drew attention to such a valiant man , who through his actions at @entity25 set a standard that the @entity7 would aspire to for the rest of the @entity3			1
' he brought honour to his regiment and that legacy will live on , as a sign of what he endured for his country			1
