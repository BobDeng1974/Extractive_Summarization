the share price ended at a one - month low of $ 467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages downgraded the stock			2
it is thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets , especially the so - called ' cheap ' @entity5 which starts at £ 469 , claiming they were n't low enough for @entity2 to attract new customers , especially in emerging markets such as @entity17			1
@entity2 's shares fell 5.4 per cent on wednesday , following the launch of its new @entity4 and @entity5			1
the price ended at $ 467.24 before rising marginally to $ 467.71			0
investors were put off by the £ 469 price of the @entity5 claiming it was n't low enough for @entity2 to attract new customers at an event in @entity25 on wednesday morning , @entity2 's ceo @entity21 and senior vice president of worldwide marketing @entity22 unveiled two new handsets			1
the @entity4 is a high - end successor to the current @entity29 model and comes in gold , silver and slate , with a fingerprint scanner built into the ' home ' button and starts at £ 549			0
the @entity5 , which before the event was rumoured to be @entity2 's first ' budget ' handset , comes in a range of five colours and has the same screen and camera as the current @entity29 model			1
@entity21 also announced at the event that the firm would be discontinuing the @entity29 5 after the new handsets go on sale on 20 september			0
rumours had suggested that the price of the bargain phone would be around £ 63 , yet the handset price starts at £ 469 , which industry experts claimed was still too expensive for low - end customers			0
analysts also accused @entity2 of misleading customers by showing the handset costing $ 99 during the event , yet that price was on a two - year contract and monthly payments were n't announced			1
around a third of the world 's handsets are sold in @entity17 to half a billion people , yet only 12 per cent of these phones are made by @entity2			2
@entity65 rivals @entity63 is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region , with @entity17 brands including @entity69 and @entity70 also popular			0
@entity2 is still a popular choice in @entity17 , but predominantly with the @entity17 elite , and @entity73 , vice president of @entity75 's @entity74 told @entity76 : ' rumor has [ @entity2 ] that they make more money in any of the five stores in @entity17 than they do in the @entity81 store in @entity82			2
' @entity2 phones in @entity17 cost around the same amount as the average person 's monthly salary in urban areas , or three months wages for a bus driver , for example			2
the @entity4 is due to sell in @entity17 for 5,288 yuan ( £ 547 ) and the @entity5 for 4,488 yuan ( £ 464 ) and the handsets , which will be available from 20 september , will be launched in @entity17 at the same time as other major territories for the first time ever			0
@entity73 continued that although @entity17 is @entity2 's second largest market , there is a large percentage of the population that it is not able to attract			1
the phrase ' @entity4 ' was the most popular search term on @entity101 , @entity17 's most widely used social network , on wednesday , while ' @entity5 ' did n't appear on the top searches list			2
users questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5s model			0
@entity2 's share of the @entity17 smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the second quarter , according to research firm @entity111 , behind not just @entity63 but also @entity70 , @entity112 , @entity69 and @entity113			1
' even though @entity2 has a lower end @entity29 now , its price is still considered mid-end in @entity17 and not low - end , ' said @entity117 , a @entity118 - based analyst for @entity119			2
around half of @entity17 's smartphone shipments are in the 700 - 1,500 yuan range , said @entity117 , but competing on those prices is n't an attractive prospect for @entity2			1
' considering @entity2 's old rival @entity63 and domestic players such as @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity127 all have phones in that category , @entity2 will still lose out in market share in these key segments , ' she said			1
no @entity133 network operators have released contract pricing yet			0
' investors were put off that @entity2 's price point did n't go low enough to attract a new market			2
it does n't have the same range in price that @entity2 's competitors have , ' said @entity141 , chief investment strategist at @entity142 in @entity143			2
' it does n't have the same range in price that @entity2 's competitors have , ' he added			2
' we believe @entity2 is foregoing a valuable and relatively easy way to return to earnings growth			0
' @entity22 , @entity2 's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , unveiled the @entity5 on tuesday			2
in the @entity150 the device starts at $ 99 on a two - year contract yet experts have called this misleading because monthly costs were n't announced			0
when bought outright , the handset is $ 549 , or £ 469 in the @entity133 @entity2 recently lost smartphone market share to main rival @entity63 , dropping to 14 per cent - its lowest for three years - because of ‘ lacklustre ’ iphone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals			1
analysts predicted that @entity2 would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets , such as @entity17 , and this was bolstered by the fact @entity2 held a mirror event in @entity165 , and announced the @entity4 will also be made available in @entity17 at the same time as other countries for the first time ever			1
rivals including @entity63 and @entity69 do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce , so cost less			0
to put this into perspective , the @entity5 will sell for 4,488 yuan ( £ 464 ) in @entity17 , which is more than the average monthly urban income for the country			1
@entity2 's ceo @entity21 , pictured , unveiled the @entity5 in @entity175 on wednesday			1
analysts predicted @entity2 would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets , such as @entity17 to rival @entity63 and @entity69 , yet the @entity5 will sell for 4,488 yuan ( £ 464 ) , which is more than the average monthly urban income for the country if the drop in @entity2 's share price was to hold or remain low , the fall would be biggest single - day slide since 24 january			1
still , @entity2 's shares climbed 28 per cent between the start of july and monday ahead of the launch as anticipation began building about the company 's next @entity29			1
despite many investors being critical of the announcement , four others raised their target prices			0
@entity192 increased its target to $ 480 from $ 420 , for example			0
reaction among industry experts and consumers was mixed			0
@entity2 's profit for the quarter which ended on 29 june , fell 22 per cent as gross margins fell below 37 per cent from more than 42 per cent in the year - earlier quarter			1
@entity202 , which cut its rating on @entity2 's stock to ' neutral ' from ' buy , ' cited a survey of 35,000 @entity17 consumers conducted by @entity207 that found only 2.6 per cent of respondents would consider buying the cheaper @entity5			1
' we worry that @entity2 's inability / unwillingness to come out with a low - priced offering for emerging markets nearly ensures that the company will continue to be an overall share loser in the smartphone market until it chooses to address the low end , ' @entity210 analysts said in a note			1
@entity221 's @entity220 was given hands - on time with @entity2 's new @entity4 following wednesday 's launch : ' @entity2 's @entity4 is without doubt an evolution rather than a revolution			1
' despite this , the @entity4 is the best looking phone on the market , and the new champagne cover is surprisingly nice - and thankfully not as bling as it looks in some pictures			0
' however , the most obvious addition is the phone 's fingerprint sensor , which could render passwords and even bank pin codes obselete			0
' after spending around 90 seconds teaching it your fingerprint by moving your hand around , you simply tap where the home button is to unlock your phone			0
' it ’s simple , and , in limited testing , works flawlessly - although there are doubts over its ability to cope with sweaty hands			0
' for anyone that has to use a passcode for their corporate email , the fingerprint sensor alone is a huge timesaver			0
it 's also very fast - simply press to the home button , and the phone powers on and recognises you in under a second			0
' the noticeably faster processor that makes it seem far snappier in use than 5 is also a decent step forward , as it the entirely redesigned camera which is a big improvement			0
