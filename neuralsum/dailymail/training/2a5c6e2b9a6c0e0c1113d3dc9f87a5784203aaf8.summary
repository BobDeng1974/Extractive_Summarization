two @entity2 newlyweds who died from a suspected drugs overdose in @entity4 may have killed themselves in a @entity6 - style suicide pact , a relative said today			1
the bodies of @entity8 and @entity9 were found on a hotel bed surrounded by sleeping pills , anti-depressants and empty bottles of cough syrup			1
police say the couple – both teachers with first - class degrees – died of an overdose in their locked room near the @entity21			1
a book called @entity23 of @entity24 : @entity25 in @entity26 , a travel bag , mobile phone and other holiday paraphernalia can also be seen on their double bed			0
mrs @entity32 's stepfather , @entity31 , said the couple may have taken their own lives in despair after being ' continually smacked in the face ' by the country 's shocking levels of poverty			1
mr @entity31 also described how her husband ' hated social injustice ' and said he had been ' quite depressed ' in the run - up to their travels			2
alluding to @entity6 , the architect told @entity57 : ' something could have triggered @entity8 into a bit of a despair and , you know , he does something daft and she follows			2
' they ’re both philosophical characters			0
' they were incredibly close and although i would have said @entity9 was inherently a much stronger personality and more balanced , i could conceive of a situation where , if @entity8 could take his life , then @entity9 could follow him			1
' the shocking scene in their hotel room is a stark contrast to the happy image that @entity32 , 24 , had posted a few days earlier of the couple smiling in front of a temple in @entity77			1
her 27 - year - old husband had posted a series of messages on @entity82 outlining his casual attitude to drugs			1
his final tweet , on sunday , two days before their bodies were found , said how easy they were to obtain in @entity4			2
‘ @entity89 under the counter here			0
with @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , ’ he wrote			0
earlier he said : ‘ one prescription in @entity4 ( after you have told the doctor what to write ) will take you faaaaaar ... ’ in another post he said : ‘ i am absolutely off my face on drugs			1
’ tragic waste : mr @entity9 pictured as a schoolboy @entity4 is a popular destination for drugs tourists keen to acquire powerful prescription medicines from chemists , with few questions asked			1
it is unclear whether the couple died from an overdose of prescription drugs or from another substance			1
although mr @entity9 made no secret of his craving for pills , relatives of his wife insisted yesterday she was anti-drugs			1
the couple , who married last november , were found dead in the @entity122 in @entity123			2
as well as strips of coloured capsules , police discovered a prescription for the anti-anxiety drug diazepam			2
mr @entity9 was found lying on his side while his wife was slumped in a crouched position			1
there was evidence in the room that one or both of them had been sick			0
@entity136 , who owns the hotel which is a popular haunt for backpackers , said the couple checked in on monday night			0
he said : ‘ later they ordered the dinner at 9pm and by 10pm our room service went with dinner			0
he knocked on the door and @entity148 opened the door and took the dinner – he did n’t allow our employee inside the room and closed the door			0
‘ they booked only for one night and were supposed to inform us about an extended stay			0
‘ when they did n’t come down , our hotel staff knocked their door at 11:30 am on tuesday , but there was no response and door was locked inside			0
he informed the manager quickly who later informed the police			0
‘ later police arrived and found that both were dead on the bed			2
both the television and air conditioner were on			0
died : @entity148 , 27 , and his wife @entity170 , 24 , pictured together in @entity4 just weeks before their death drugs paraphernalia : police found these strips of tablets - thought to be sleeping pills and anti-depressants - next to the couple 's bodies on the bed in their hotel room along with bottles cough syrup ( not pictured ) ‘ @entity174 found five empty bottles of cough syrup , strips of sleeping pills , anti-depressants and a medical prescription from the @entity189 in @entity77 , mentioning a drug called diazepam – used to treat anxiety disorders			1
’ @entity193 , who is a police chief in @entity123 , said : ‘ from the prescription , it appears that the woman had some sort of headache			2
‘ a lot of anti-depressants , pain killers and other medicines were found in the room			2
‘ there were no apparent signs of any struggle or forced entry into the room			0
we have looked at all possible scenarios and it looks like a case of a drug overdose			0
’ @entity214 , the @entity77 doctor who prescribed mr @entity9 the diazepam , said : ‘ he said he ’d been on the medicine for a long time and he had come to me for a repeat prescription			1
' he was addicted to these pills so it ’s not safe to come off them immediately , he has to come off them slowly			0
so i gave him a different dose as a repeat prescription			0
‘ you need to slowly reduce your intake , it is very serious if you stop taking them immediately , so i felt it reasonable to give him another prescription			0
