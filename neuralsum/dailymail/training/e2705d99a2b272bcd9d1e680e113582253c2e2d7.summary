by @entity0 the bodies of 87 migrants were found on wednesday in @entity5 's desert north after they died of thirst just a few kilometres from the border of @entity9 , their planned destination , sources said			1
the corpses of the seven men , 32 women and 48 children were in addition to five bodies of women and girls found earlier , a security source said			1
all died in early october after a failed attempt to reach @entity9 that began in late september , the source added			1
death in the desert : a graphic showing where the bodies of 87 migrants were found in @entity5 after two vehicles taking them to @entity9 broke down before reaching the border @entity33 , from local aid organisation @entity31 , confirmed the death toll and gave a graphic account of discovering the bodies , some of which he said may have been eaten by jackals			1
' the corpses were decomposed			0
it was horrible , ' he said			0
' we found them in different locations in a 20km ( 12 - mile ) radius and in small groups , often under trees , or under the sun. ' sometimes a mother and children , but some lone children too			1
' the bodies were buried according to @entity53 rites , ' as and when they were found , ' added @entity54			2
mr @entity54 said that because so many of the dead were children or teenagers , it was possible they were heading for low paid jobs in @entity9			1
treacherous : the seven men , 32 women and 48 children died of thirst in early october after walking for days in the @entity63 ( above , file picture ) @entity5 officials said on monday that dozens of migrants , most of them women and children , had died of thirst in the @entity63 desert earlier this month			1
two vehicles were carrying the migrants when they broke down , one about 83 kilometres ( 51 miles ) from the city of @entity76 , northern niger where they had set off from , and another at 158 kilometres ( 98 miles ) , a security source said			1
' the first vehicle broke down			0
the second returned to @entity76 to get a spare part after getting all the migrants it was carrying to alight , but it too broke down , ' said the source			2
' we think that the migrants were in the desert for seven days and on the fifth day , they began to leave the broken down vehicle in search of a well , ' said the source			0
however , 21 people had survived , the source said , including a man who walked to @entity76 and a woman who was saved by a driver who came across her in the desert and took her to the same city			2
- aid worker nineteen others reached the @entity9 city of @entity103 , but were sent back to @entity5 , the source added			2
in the lucrative business of transporting @entity106 fleeing conditions at home for what they hope will be a better life elsewhere , traffickers quite frequently abandon their human cargo in the desert , leaving them to near certain death			0
@entity114 , who works for the non-governmental organisation @entity115 in @entity76 , said the group left behind consisted of ' entire families , including many children and women , who departed for @entity9 , where they hoped to beg for their keep '			1
@entity5 is one of the world 's poorest countries and has been hit by successive food crises			2
@entity124 , rather than @entity9 , is more frequently the favoured country of transit for west africans making the journey across the continent , many of whom aim to travel on to @entity131			0
the @entity133 's @entity132 estimates that at least 30,000 economic migrants passed through @entity135 , northern @entity5 's largest city , between march and august of this year			0
these migrants often look to @entity131 as their final destination , a security source told @entity140 , and use @entity124 as a jumping off point amid the relative chaos in the @entity144 country since the fall of @entity146 in 2011			0
humanitarian agencies say nearly 20,000 migrants have perished while trying to cross the @entity149 into @entity131 over the past 20 years			0
the death of more than 300 @entity106 in a shipwreck off the @entity153 island of @entity154 earlier this month has recently pushed the issue to the top of @entity131 's political agenda .			0
