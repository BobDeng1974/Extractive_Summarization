the man who followed the man who followed sir @entity2 was always meant to be the lucky one and on monday that stroke of good fortune officially went the way of @entity7			0
appointing @entity9 ’s first continental manager has been a protracted process , and one that will not have pleased the @entity14 @entity13 so close to the start of the @entity16 , but the club feel they have made the right choice this time			1
the situation @entity21 inherits at @entity22 could not be more different from the one that faced his predecessor 12 months ago			1
turning things around will not be easy			0
@entity21 must revive a club that tumbled from @entity51 title winners to seventh place over the course of a season			2
the top four and a return to the @entity57 has to be his aim			0
he must restore the confidence and swagger to a team who became almost frightened of their own shadow and he must get the best out of players who , for one reason or another , let down @entity45 so badly			2
some of them will no longer be around when the 62 - year - old @entity14 officially takes charge in july			1
and there is a £ 200million kitty available to replace them			1
gone : @entity45 ( pictured with @entity74 chief executive @entity73 ) was sacked by the club in april safe pair of hands : @entity78 has been taking care of business at @entity22 in the interim @entity9 could n’t be sure if @entity45 was the man to spend that money but , in @entity21 , they believe they have an established statesman of @entity86 football ; a coach who has been in charge of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 and has the success to show for it			1
there will be no issues convincing the @entity9 players of his credentials			1
it was notable that the talks with @entity9 chief @entity97 and @entity78 last week took place on @entity21 ’s terms , on @entity21 ’s turf in @entity26			1
at his penthouse apartment on @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity101 held court and told his guests what they wanted to hear			0
‘ he will have spelt out to @entity9 the @entity21 philosophy , ’ said a source close to him			1
‘ attacking , dominant , pressure football			0
’ @entity21 ( right ) is a big character with a big ego			2
some are concerned that it might be too @entity115 referred to a ‘ larger than life character ’ on monday and some people at the club are already bracing themselves for a bumpy ride			0
@entity9 suffered through their lack of activity in the transfer market last summer and can not afford to make the same mistake again			2
many of the targets remain the same , but @entity21 is bound to have plans of his own and they must be hatched around the restrictions of a @entity16			2
in charge : @entity78 ( left ) took charge of a double training session for @entity9 's players on tuesday born : august 8 , 1951 age : 62 place of birth : @entity135 , @entity26 clubs played for : @entity37 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 total appearances : 333 total goals : 34 clubs managed : @entity37 , @entity38 ( two spells ) , @entity140 , @entity39 countries managed : @entity26 ( 2000 - 02 and 2012 - present ) honours as a manager : @entity148 ( 1993 - 94 , 1994 - 95 , 1995 - 96 , 2008 - 09 ) , @entity149 1991 - 92 , @entity57 1994 - 95 , @entity150 ( 1995 and 1997 ) , @entity151 ( 1997 - 98 and 1998 - 99 ) , @entity152 ( 1997 - 98 ) , @entity153 2009 - 10 of the current @entity9 squad , what now for the likes of @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 ? can @entity21 get the best out of @entity161 and @entity162 ? some players could face a very different future now that he has taken over , and none more so than @entity31			1
the striker never bought into the @entity168 project , and it is unlikely that he would have stayed around had the @entity170 survived his first season			0
now the @entity26 captain is being tipped to be @entity21 ’s skipper at @entity9 as well , although where that leaves @entity176 is an intriguing question			1
on the move ? winger @entity156 could find himself out of @entity21 's plans for next season out of favour : @entity182 star @entity157 struggled for playing time under @entity45 last season not needed ? @entity21 is hoping to sign @entity39 's @entity185 , which could spell the end of @entity158 's @entity22 career @entity188 coach - age 57 one of @entity21 ’s longest - serving and most trusted lieutenants , the former @entity191 goalkeeper has worked at @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and the @entity14 national team , and has overseen the development of the likes of @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			1
@entity199 has written various books on the training methods of goalkeepers			2
@entity203 bout - assistant coach - age 51 specialises in scouting opposition , @entity204 has previously held roles at @entity39 , @entity138 , @entity140 , @entity191 and @entity208			1
@entity176 almost left @entity9 over what he perceived as @entity2 ’s favouritism towards @entity212 , but the pendulum swung back in his favour under @entity216 and he was set to inherit the armband from @entity219			2
negotiating that particular minefield will be an early test of @entity21 ’s skills			2
he has already made a wise move by appointing @entity78 as his no 2			0
keeping a @entity9 icon and someone who knows the club inside out has gone down equally well in the boardroom and the dressing room			0
another issue that will have scored heavily with @entity9 bosses is @entity21 ’s commitment to youth			1
does @entity21 look outside @entity22 to replace @entity219 and @entity234 or trust in @entity236 , @entity237 and highly rated youngsters like @entity239 ? welcome aboard ! @entity78 has been handed the assistant manager 's role at @entity22 come on in ! @entity204 , who assisted @entity21 at @entity39 , has also rocked up at @entity9 in his conversations with @entity78 he is known to have asked about the state of the club ’s academy and the identities of those ready to make an impact on the first team			1
‘ he wo n’t just go out and buy players , ’ said the source			0
‘ he will look to the academy			0
‘ if two players are of the same quality he will always prefer the younger one			0
they are more adaptable to his style and he ’ll convert them into top players			0
’ they were saying equally nice things about @entity45 a year ago , however , and regrettably for him it did n’t work out			0
@entity7 will not be burdened by being anointed the @entity260			0
maybe he really is the @entity261 , the man who followed the man			0
he 's a keeper : @entity21 has lured goalkeeping coach @entity199 to join @entity9 to replace @entity264			1

@entity21 has signed a three - year deal at @entity22
@entity14 will be given £ 200million to revamp @entity9 's squad this summer
a number of first team players could be shown the exit door
@entity78 has *agreed* to become @entity21 's assistant
coaches @entity199 and @entity204 will join @entity9 's coaching staff
