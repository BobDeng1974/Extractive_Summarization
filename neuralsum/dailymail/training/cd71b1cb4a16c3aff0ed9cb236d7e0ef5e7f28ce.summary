by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 26 january 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 26 january 2013 distinction : the new @entity3 will allow same sex couples to marry - but not to use adultery as grounds for divorce should their partner be unfaithful plans to allow same - sex couples to marry in @entity12 could pave the way for the concept of adultery to be abolished in law , experts have said			1
under the government 's draft @entity3 only infidelity between a man and a woman constitutes adultery			1
so while the law would give same - sex couples the right to wed , they would not be able to divorce their partner on the basis of adultery if their spouse went on to be unfaithful - unless they cheated with somebody of the opposite sex			1
it also states that a straight person who discovered their husband or wife had a lover of the same - sex could not accuse their unfaithful partner of adultery in a divorce court			1
lawyers and mps have argued that the distinction over adultery - which arose after @entity19 legal experts failed to agree on what constitutes sex between same - sex couples - would cause confusion			2
they warned it would create inequality between heterosexual and homosexual married couples who found themselves in the divorce courts , and said it would likely result in adultery being abolished altogether as a grounds for divorce			2
the lawyers who drafted the government 's @entity3 managed to swerve the contentious question of what constitutes sex between homosexual couples by adding a clause which states that only ' conduct ' between a married person and a person of the opposite sex would constitute adultery			1
leading divorce lawyer @entity65 told the @entity66 the impact of the clause could lead to the concept of adultery to being scrapped from law altogether			0
she said abolishing the act of adultery as a basis for divorce would be the only ' appropriate and balanced ' way to deal with the distinction between same sex and straight couples arising from the new @entity3			2
confusion : the distinction between heterosexual and same - sex couples under the new @entity3 would lead to confusion , lawyers and mps have said the government 's draft @entity3 was published this week			1
@entity85 is forging ahead with the law despite fierce opposition from within the ranks of his own party			0
it will give same - sex couples the right to marry in civil or religious ceremonies if the faith in question chooses to carry it out			2
culture secretary @entity97 , who is also minister for equalities , has said the @entity3 would ensure ‘ equal and fair ’ treatment for gay couples			0
she has said the law ' protects and promotes religious freedom ' , allowing all religious organisations to act according to their doctrines and beliefs			0
this @entity3 protects and promotes religious freedom , so all religious organisations can act according to their doctrines and beliefs			0
’ but @entity110 mps who oppose the law argue there is no guarantee that faith groups and public sector workers could not be sued under equalities legislation - and be defeated in the @entity117			0
mps are expected to debate the controversial @entity3 next month .			0

@entity3 to allow same - sex marriage was published this week by the government
makes clear that only infidelity between a man and a woman would count as adultery in a divorce court
means a person in a same - sex marriage would not be able to divorce their partner on grounds of adultery if their spouse went on to be unfaithful
