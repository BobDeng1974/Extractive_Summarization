a hospital has suspended cancer surgery over fears that five patients died unnecessarily within a year			1
@entity7 operations on patients with cancer of the oesophagus have been halted with immediate effect , the @entity5 and @entity4 announced yesterday			1
the hospital had been one of the few areas in the country to do the operation and surgeons had been travelling around the world lecturing about its benefits			1
five patients died from ' potentially avoidable ' complications after surgery at @entity21 one of the patients who died was a 51 - year - old father - of - one , whose lawyers say he was cajoled into having the procedure and ‘ made to feel like a human guinea pig ’			1
the @entity27 understands that the surgeons filmed the operation on him last july – and it was broadcast live to a medical conference taking place in the @entity33 the same man died 16 days later from a blood clot and his family are now taking legal action against the trust			1
bosses have refused to name the surgeons involved , but the trust confirmed that the surgeons were still working , although the matter has been referred to the @entity44 – which may decide to suspend them			0
the trust has also luanched its own internal inquiry			0
solicitor @entity50 , acting for man ’s widow , told the @entity27 : ‘ there seem to be serious questions to be asked about the reliability of the procedure in question			0
new surgical techniques are vital but they must not be tried out on patients until they are safe			1
’ initially , the patient was due to have the standard open surgery to remove the tumour as which has a longer recovery period			2
but days before the operation , surgeons persuaded him to have the keyhole surgery , as he would recover quicker			2
he also consented for the procedure to be broadcast live at a conference			0
miss @entity50 said : ‘ he was made to feel really lucky to have this surgery rather than the conventional open surgery			2
’ @entity71 surgery has been suspended and the trust is now sending patients requiring it to @entity75 in central @entity76 instead the operation went well and 11 days later the patient was discharged			1
five days later he suffered a major haemorrhage			0
he was taken to hospital , but died the next day			1
miss @entity50 added : ‘ my client , the man ’s widow , is very upset by the whole episode			0
she wrote a letter of complaint to the hospital and the surgeon replied			2
‘ it is highly unusual as complaints are normally dealt with by the hospital trust , not by the consultant			2
he said there had been complications that had led to the patient ’s death			0
he did not say sorry or give any kind of apology			2
’ she added that the patient should have had a good prospect of recovery , but instead his death has left his family traumatised			0
the keyhole operation normally lasts four hours , and involves removing the tumour and surrounding tissue using a microscopic camera and surgical instruments			0
at the same time surgeons use part of the stomach to create a section of oesophagus to replace the infected section			0
patients of the trust in @entity118 are being sent instead to @entity75 in central @entity76			1
medical director at the @entity5 and @entity121 trust , dr @entity119 , said : ‘ we are sorry that some patients did not receive the level of care and treatment that they should have due to potentially avoidable surgical complications			1
