@entity5 has put up a sign outside the front door of his furniture and antiques shop in @entity17 , @entity18 , which reads in bold letters ' @entity23 ' mr @entity5 claims tourists use his shop to kill time while they wait for their buses home and says they put off genuine customers if mr @entity5 does not recognise a customer , he quizzes them on who they are and where they are from			1

but the shop owner has been labelled ' eccentric ' by his local chamber of commerce who fear the move will put people off visiting the town			1
mr @entity5 , who is in his 60s , said : ' we have made a decision that this business should be a local business for local people			1
' we have a coach drop - off and pick - up point immediately opposite us and we can have 500 to 600 coach passengers a day coming in and buying absolutely nothing			0
' we have put up with it for three years and we believe that maybe one in every 2,500 tourists has spent a pound or two			0
the rest have spent nothing			0
the sign reads : ' regretably [ sic ] we no longer allow tourists entry as furniture too large to take on coach ' ' we have really tried to cater for tourists by selling small trinkets and ornaments for a few pounds but they are not interested in buying			0

' it was having a huge detrimental impact on our business so we decided to make it a local business for local people			1
' we are an independent retailer , we pay extremely high rents and rates for being in the high street			0

some officials fear that mr @entity5 's actions will put visitors off @entity17 ( file photo ) ' at first i thought he was joking			1
we were actually looking for a piece of furniture on behalf of a @entity17 - based relative but i did n't see why i should have to explain that to him			2
' we had had a lovely time in @entity17 but that 's not what i will be taking away from me			2
