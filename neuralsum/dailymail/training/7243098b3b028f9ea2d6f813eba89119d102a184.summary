by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 2 november 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 2 november 2013 well - known brand names for everyday products like toothpaste , peanut butter , ketchup and coffee have been sprayed all over the walls of a @entity9 city by a street artist			1
photography graduate and artist , @entity13 , known as @entity14 , has tagged a series of brand logos using the product they represent			1
her project , called @entity20 , was taken to the streets of downtown @entity22 , a @entity9 city in @entity23 , where she painted product logos using the product they promote			1
@entity28 : this @entity30 toothpaste logo was created using actual tubes of the toothpaste ketchup : the iconic @entity35 brand is recreated in tomato sauce - not paint clean : the @entity38 logo is made by slathering shaving foam over the template chocolate : @entity42 was the brand that inspired miss @entity13 to start her artwork salad dressing spread is used to create this @entity47 stencil which miss @entity13 does overnight ' @entity48 ' : @entity13 ( pictured ) creates artwork out of brand names using the product it advertises the advantage of @entity13 's graffiti is that it washes off easily			1
the 23 - year - old created the @entity57 logo by dry - rubbing its powdered coffee on to a wall ; @entity62 's brand mark is replicated in magic marker ; @entity30 is applied with a toothbrush on to red brick ; and the @entity38 logo lathered in shaving foam on the side of a salmon - coloured school building			1
miss @entity13 creates her designs by enlarging a brand 's logo in @entity73 , prints it out in pieces , and from there creates a stencil			2
all of the artwork is done overnight under the cover of darkness			0
miss @entity13 said : ' this street art series was inspired by @entity42			0
i was thinking about doing a street art series in @entity22 since there is n't much of an art scene here , and since i 'm a huge lover of @entity42 my first thought was to express my love for chocolate by putting the @entity42 logo around the city			0
i then thought it would be a good idea to make it out of @entity42			0
eventually i went even further and turned it in to a big logo series			0
' miss @entity13 explained that some of the logos did n't last very long and were removed quickly or deteriorated on their own			2
coffee : powdered coffee was rubbed all over the wall to create the company 's logo usually on a hotdog : @entity106 's mustard logo painted in the yellow sauce washable graffiti : the @entity110 logo is painted in peanut butter popular pen brand @entity62 was drawn using the branded pens cheesy : this logo changed colour and went translucent after it was up for a while			0
