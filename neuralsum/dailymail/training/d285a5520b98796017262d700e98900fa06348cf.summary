as an acolyte of @entity2 ’s at @entity3 , @entity0 found himself the most sought - after man at @entity5 when the name of @entity8 ’s successor broke in the summer			1
a key member of the most unlikely team to win the @entity12 in 40 years 12 months ago , the midfielder was only too happy to lay it on thick when a string of inquisitors asked exactly what they could expect from the new man in charge			1
tellingly though , whilst happy to eulogise about @entity2 ’s strengths to anyone who cared to listen , @entity0 stopped short of promising overnight miracles			1
no gain without pain might have been a neat summary of his view of the future			2
@entity0 believes the @entity28 will continue to improve under @entity2 accordingly , when @entity29 fumbled their way through the first three months of the season , @entity0 felt no need to correct himself			1
provided his team - mates continued to buy into the new man ’s methods , he remained convinced his long - term prediction would hold true			2
‘ it always takes time to adapt to a new culture but i think he ’s starting to get there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ at the start of season we did n’t get the results we wanted			2
i said at the time , though , it was always going to take time with the new gaffer			1
he had new ideas he wanted to put into the team and you ’re starting to see the team he wants			2
we are getting results and are still in every cup while being at the top of the league			2
we ’re doing well in the @entity55 as well and , hopefully , we can get through there			2
@entity29 have lost just once in their last 15 games under @entity2 at @entity5 ‘ things are starting to look good now but it ’s still early in the season and we need to keep it going			1
‘ things were tough at the start but i do n’t think anyone had a problem sticking with him			2
he was talking to us all during that time			1
it ’s going to be good in the end			2
like i say , just give him time			1
@entity29 is going to be a success with him as manager			1
’ that statement is much easier to swallow now than at any stage in @entity2 ’s tenure to date			1
few would have dared to have muttered it aloud after the debacles that were @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 but , with each passing week , matters have improved incrementally			2
however , looking back on some of those grim affairs , it ’s instinctive to ask @entity0 if his fellow @entity81 told him to do a little dressing - room politicking on his behalf			1
‘ he did n’t ask me to do that , ’ he stonewalled			2
‘ he did well in @entity81 and does n’t have any problem explaining what he wants here			2
he ’s very clear on that — he does n’t need me to do that			2
he ’s fully capable of doing that by himself			2
’ only 39 , @entity2 is distinct from the battle - hardened figures like @entity92 and @entity93 who have occupied the dugout in recent times			1
like @entity8 , he is having to learn much on the job			2
the burden at times must feel overwhelming and yet @entity0 can testify that time spent with him is not devoid of moments of levity			1
‘ he ’s a serious guy when he needs to be but he ’ll also make some jokes , ’ he said			2
‘ the important thing is he ’s got a good mix — in training today we needed a hard session after coming back from the international break			1
but of course , sometimes he will make a joke or something			0
sometimes you need to have a laugh			0
you ca n’t be serious all the time			1
‘ maybe sometimes people forget he ’s so young			0
but that ’s the kind of pressure we have at the club			0
‘ it does n’t matter if you are a player of 18 or 27 , the expectation is the same			0
’ @entity0 has been arguably @entity29 's best performer so far this season while victory at @entity123 last time out was the most impressive domestic result of @entity2 ’s reign to date , his reaction eclipsed anything that ’s happened on the field of play			1
previously sedate to the point where his passion was being questioned , @entity2 ’s fist - pumping and roars of approval to the visiting throng went down every bit as well as @entity137 ’s late winner			1
not quite the striptease he famously performed in front of the @entity141 fans after saving them from relegation — but scenes of unity and joy so far conspicuous by their absence since he came to @entity149			0
‘ you can see the game meant a lot to him , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ like everyone else at @entity29 , he wants to be at the top of the table			1
the @entity158 game was the last game before the international break and our chance to get on top			1
‘ with the way we won the game , with one man down ( after @entity168 ’s dismissal ) , it was great			0
‘ we kept on going and , when @entity137 scored the winner near the end , it was a fantastic feeling			0
the game was n’t so good , we did n’t play to our best but winning was a good feeling for everybody			0
’ rest assured , that the unbridled emotion of that day was quickly replaced by a steely resolve for improvement			0
@entity0 can testify to the fact that , irrespective of a scoreline , @entity2 ’s desire for individual and collective improvement is bordering on the obsessive			1
‘ he is always saying things to me because he always looks for improvement , ’ he said			0
‘ he does that with all the players — especially when you are doing well			0
he wants you to do even better every day			0
that ’s how it should be			0
you can never be satisfied or good enough in football			0
that ’s what he ’s aiming for in everyone and himself			0
@entity2 is having to learn much on the job like predecessor @entity8 ‘ for example , when i played in @entity3 , i created chances but he told me i needed to work on my defence and be smarter in where i ran			1
it was always a couple of small things — small details			0
that ’s what makes you a better player			0
’ those who are determined to become the best they can be will thrive under him			0
those who stand still will be discarded			0
evidently not a man who plays favourites , previous relationships count for nothing in the here and now			0
‘ i speak with him in @entity213 when all the players are around , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ they would n’t understand what we were saying otherwise			0
if i talk with him alone , i can talk in @entity81 , but , if there ’s anyone else there , i will talk in @entity213			0
it ’s out of respect for the other players and the rest of the staff			0
if they want to be part of the conversation , that ’s the way it should be			0
’ increasingly , in more ways than one , @entity2 and his players are speaking the same language			1
talk of a @entity237 has never been far from the manager ’s lips , a view heartily endorsed by @entity0			1
‘ yes he mentions it to us , ’ the midfielder said ahead of tomorrow ’s visit of @entity243			1
‘ we all know the expectation that comes with being a player at @entity29			1
‘ the fans want us to win trophies and that ’s what we want as well			0
that ’s why we are @entity29 players — to want to win every trophy			1
we still have the chance of success as we are in every cup			0
‘ if we keep winning we will win those trophies			0
i know how hard it is — but it ’s still possible			0
’ the @entity260 have presented both @entity261 and @entity262 with cheques for £ 25,000 as a result of money raised during september ’s @entity266 .			0

hoops lost just once in their last 15 games before international break
@entity29 will hope to continue run when they face @entity243 on *saturday*
@entity0 also worked with boss @entity2 during time at @entity3
