i love my job but without doubt the best part of it comes every saturday afternoon , presenting the football extravaganza that is @entity6 on @entity7 from one of the top games of the day			0
this saturday topped the lot			0
at a cramped but cosy @entity12 , restricted by the most limited and challenging resources , i hosted the show while watching @entity14 take on @entity15 in one of the best @entity17 ties i 've ever seen			1
as i said on air , it was ' thud and blunder ' - a classic third - round tie which had everything - a bad pitch , tiny dressing rooms , a @entity27 minnow against a big club , but also the possibility of an upset			0
@entity14 players celebrate taking the lead against @entity15 as they looked for an @entity17 upset @entity34 salutes @entity14 fans after he got the side on their way to a giant killing , before @entity15 hit back @entity39 celebrates as @entity14 lost their two - goal cushion and @entity15 went 3 - 2 up on saturday somehow this was n't regarded as fit for live tv			1
so many people just do not understand the @entity17 , including some who should know better			2
take @entity47 : he 's had more than 30 years in the game , he 's from @entity49 , he 's a @entity49 fan , he 's been around the club for years as apprentice through to caretaker manager			1
and yet not even @entity47 understands how much the fans want to do well in the @entity17			1
if he did , there is no way he would have picked that team who disgraced the great name of @entity49 at @entity59 on saturday			1
@entity49 fans shout abuse at their team at the end of the @entity17 third - round match @entity47 's @entity49 team selection disrespected the @entity49 who had travelled to watch the game some have suggested the team selection was n't down to @entity47 , but if that is the case i 'm sure he would n't be interested in the manager 's job permanently			1
let 's be clear here : i have no problem with managers picking what some would consider a weakened side			2
if that manager believes it 's a team that can win the game , then there is no issue			2
@entity85 are a good example from this weekend			0
@entity87 knew he could win the tie at @entity89 with the ' weakened ' team he selected - and he was proved right			0
but for @entity49 to risk a below - strength team against @entity93 opposition who picked up points over @entity96 and @entity97 , was pure folly and totally disrespectful to the @entity49 fans			1
as for the tv execs who pick the games , some of the criticism aimed at them has been harsh			0
if it was easy to predict what 's going to happen we 'd all be millionaires			0
but the gulf between @entity27 and @entity93 these days means @entity109 were always unlikely to beat @entity110			0
@entity49 's stand - in boss @entity47 reacts on the touchline during the game against @entity59 @entity49 goalkeeper @entity114 is helpless to stop the first goal of the game at the @entity117 @entity118 against @entity119 might turn out to be brilliant , but there is nothing prior to the game suggesting it could be a classic			1
an educated guess could have told anyone @entity14 would be more likely to push @entity15 close			1
no guarantee , but most genuine football fans were surprised the @entity14 game was n't on tv			1
blyth are run by a chairman who 's a genuine philanthropist , a local businessman who puts his money back into the community to help local people			0
if ever a chairman deserved live football at his ground it 's @entity138			0
he 's even got views on the future of football which make interesting listening			0
i was grateful for the chance to spend some time with him live on @entity7 on saturday before the match			0
@entity34 applauds fans after @entity148 were knocked out of the @entity17 despite their courageous effort @entity14 players look gutted after letting their two - goal lead slip in the @entity17 third round the @entity14 captain @entity34 has been at the club 10 years , is a barman at a local pub , and he scored both of @entity148 's goals on the day			1
the manager @entity159 has supported the club since he was eight , his son plays for them , he lives two doors away from the chairman			0
the stories were there , it had the makings of the classic it turned out to be , but tv seems obsessed with the @entity93 these days			0
@entity148 did themselves proud against @entity15 but ultimately could not get beyond the @entity17 third round @entity14 fans get in the mood ahead of the match as they entered @entity12 ready for the @entity17 tie it was a fantastic occasion at @entity14 on saturday , and a wonderfully dramatic game of football			1
@entity176 missed out because someone making the decisions just does n't ' get ' the @entity17			2
@entity47 and @entity49 do n't ' get ' the @entity17 either			1
@entity49 wo n't be going down or getting into the @entity179 so why not go for it with a full - strength side in the @entity17 ? the importance of the @entity17 has been questioned in the @entity93 era			1
@entity49 players look dejected after the final whistle as @entity185 applauds the travelling fans @entity187 squares up to @entity49 's @entity188 during a heated opening at the @entity190 but i 've yet to interview a footballer who does n't want to win it or do well in it			1
@entity195 and @entity196 have won everything at club level - apart from the @entity17			2
talk to either of them about that blip on their football cv and you 'll be left in no doubt they both desperately want to win the @entity17			2
look how @entity208 fans celebrated last year			0
i love the @entity17 despite the fact my team @entity210 have been useless in the competition for several decades			1
i interviewed @entity213 recently and brought up his goal at @entity215 last season against @entity217			0
he admitted he had watched the goal back again that morning			0
it clearly meant the world to him to score the winner in the @entity17 final			2
unfortunately managers , some owners , and tv executives do n't understand the @entity17			1
sadly these people are the key decision - makers in football			0
@entity213 fondly remembers his @entity17 - winning strike against @entity217 from last may			2

@entity49 's team selection at @entity59 disgraced the club
@entity47 's @entity234 disrespected the travelling @entity49
@entity14 ' heroic loss to @entity15 should have been *televised*
some managers and *broadcasters* simply do n't ' get ' the @entity17
fans and players *cherish* and love the @entity17 and want it taken seriously
