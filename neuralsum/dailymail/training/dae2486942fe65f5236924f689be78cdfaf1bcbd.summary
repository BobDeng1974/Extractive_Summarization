a top policeman who was accused of whistle blowing after he had his home and office bugged by colleagues has told how he 's been left him ' humiliated ' by an investigation into the scandal			2
@entity9 deputy police commissioner @entity8 told a parliamentary inquiry he has been punished for speaking out , including being passed over for promotion , while attacking the way the @entity13 has handled a two - year investigation into the bugging scandal that reaches to the highest levels of the @entity17			1
mr @entity8 , who has hunted murderers , worked in warzones and faced death threats from terrorists , has revealed there is no one he fears more than @entity9 ombudsman @entity23			2
the parliamentary inquiry is the final stage of @entity26 , an investigation which begun two years ago by the @entity13 , using royal commission - style powers to investigate two controversial operations , @entity31 and @entity32 , mounted by the police @entity35 and @entity36 unit in 2000			2
he became the target of a surveillance operation overseen by the current police commissioner , @entity57 and run by his now fellow deputy , @entity58			1
' i received many threats from @entity61 and other proxy groups , ' mr @entity8 told the @entity64 inquiry in @entity65 on friday , referring to his work advising coalition police forces in @entity42 and leading a @entity69 investigation into the 2005 assassination of @entity72 prime minister @entity71			2
' i fear no man and i have operated in trusted circles with the top secret level of clearance from our national government and our allies			0
' yet i have never been denigrated , humiliated and had my every action and thought so unreasonably maligned as i experienced during @entity26			0
' the rival : deputy police commissioner @entity82 has denied she illegally bugged police or enacted listening device warrants against fellow deputy commissioner @entity8 as ' part of a personal vendetta '			1
both senior officers are seen as candidates for the next @entity9 police commissioner man the middle : current @entity9 police commissioner @entity57 was the boss of the internal affairs unit that bugged the phones of 114 police and others in what is now being investigated as an illegal phone tapping scandal that threatens to tarnish @entity57 's administration and end his deputy @entity82 's career mr @entity8 told the inquiry he was targeted by officers in @entity103 with whom he was in conflict , stemming , among other things , from complaints he made about them plagiarising a report he wrote on covert policing			1
the early @entity112 investigation found nothing but harmed his life , his family and his career , he said			0
his mobile phone and his office as head of the homicide squad were bugged , as was the home of his ex-wife and children , and he was passed over for promotions			0
current @entity9 police commissioner @entity57 was head of @entity103 at the time @entity126 and @entity127 @entity32 were conducted , and current deputy commissioner @entity58 was the @entity103 officer in charge of the operations			1
ms @entity58 , who has denied any wrongdoing in a statement , also appeared before the state parliamentary inquiry on friday afternoon			0
mr @entity8 said @entity26 had sided with the officers being complained about and targeted him and other victims			1
from child immigrant to @entity136 : @entity8 came from @entity137 to @entity138 aged twelve , named ' @entity139 ' and was fluent in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
he has risen through the ranks of the @entity17 as a hostage negotiator , homicide squad chief , counter terrorism expert , special adviser to @entity42 and now a contender for next commissioner softly spoken : well - liked and a skilful and respected operator , deputy police commissioner @entity8 ( pictured ) has a softly spoken manner which belies his incisive approach to tackling crime			1
after training police in @entity42 , @entity8 returned to warn that @entity138 was ' not in isolation ' and could be targeted by terrorists after making complaints about the bugging , he was called down for a ' friendly ' hearing with the ombudsman last september but instead faced a day - long attack on his credibility			1
' it felt to me this was a well - planned attack to silence me as one of the main complainants , ' he said			0
' the ombudsman has now summoned me again to appear before him and i hold fears of his intentions towards me			0
' he told the inquiry : ' yet again my privacy has been utterly invaded with operation prospect where my diaries , my notebooks , my emails my phone records have all been seised by the ombudsman and yet again the justification for this invasion of privacy is completely out of proportion to what is alleged			0
' veteran journalist @entity184 , who has written extensively about operations @entity31 and @entity32 , appeared before the inquiry and testified that @entity103 officers had condoned a criminal informant giving perjured evidence in court			2
uncertainty : commissioner @entity57 ( above ) may be affected by the inquiry into the secret bugging operation he oversaw mr @entity184 also revealed that he had been called before the ombudsman in 2014 and was asked - with the agreement of his source - to reveal where he obtained documents relating to @entity126			2
mr @entity8 , an @entity142 speaking counter terrorism expert who is an @entity44 trained hostage negotiator , has worked the netherworld of the undercover cop and been on the ground in @entity42 training a police force to operate after the downfall of @entity205			1
he has an outwardly gentle manner which belies his hard headed approach to tackling crime			0
as one of the most experienced police officers in @entity138 he found himself a victim at the centre of the bugging scandal which threatens to engulf the hierarchy of the nation 's oldest and largest police force			1
@entity8 , 57 , is touted as a leading candidate to take over the top job as @entity9 police commissioner			1
he appeared at the parliamentary inquiry to give evidence of ' massive wrongdoing and habitual illegal acts ' committed during the bugging operation by senior officers			1
he has equal ranking with deputy commissioner @entity58 , the officer who is accused of bugging 114 people , including police officers , civilians and a journalist			1
ms @entity58 was the senior officer who briefed @entity9 politicians in the wake of the december siege on the @entity236 cafe			0
mr @entity8 is expected to say illegal acts committed during an internal police affairs investigation called @entity126 were ' sanctioned and covered up ' by the @entity239 and @entity240			2
he is the most high profile police officer placed under covert surveillance by the operation , which aimed to bug allegedly corrupt police in the early 2000s			0
voice of the siege : @entity82 was the senior police officer who faced the media after briefing @entity9 politicians about the police operation in the @entity65 siege			1
it has since been revealed that siege victim @entity251 died when a fragment of a police bullet hit one of her arteries his unquestioned integrity and wealth of experience fighting crime - he has been a commander of the @entity262 and an assistant commissioner for counter terrorism , as well as being deployed by the federal government to @entity42 as a special police adviser - makes mr @entity8 's evidence most damning			1
@entity58 put @entity126 into play the day before the opening of the @entity270 , on september 14 , 2000 , when she allegedly swore a warrant for the @entity272 unit ( @entity103 ) before @entity65 judge @entity274			0
almost half of the officers ' names on the warrant were supposed to have attended a farewell function for a retiring police sergeant at a club on @entity65 's north shore			0
the warrant was based on flawed information			0
most of the officers had not attended the function which had been held three months earlier			0
when @entity289 news revealed the bugging operation in 2002 , ms @entity58 was ordered to report to the @entity9 police minister			1
then police commissioner @entity293 dismissed the issue on national television , saying if he has been a guest at the police farewell , he too would have been bugged			2
the allegedly illegal bugging operation continued to surface in reports since , becoming part of an investigation called @entity301 and the crux of the @entity9 @entity64 inquiry which opened on thursday			1
on the ground : @entity8 , pictured with then police minister @entity305 in 2006 , warned on his return from @entity42 that year that ' @entity138 is very much part of the international community and if something happens in @entity311 or @entity42 , we have to accept that it has an impact over here ' in the lead up to the inquiry , ms @entity58 has denied falsifying evidence in the warrant to judge @entity274 to secretly bug police , or to ' use illegal warrants to secretly record conversations of my rivals in the police force '			1
she has specifically denied she directed use of illegal warrants to bug mr @entity8 ' as part of a personal vendetta ' when there was no suspicion of his wrongdoing			0
@entity8 , 57 , is the son of @entity332 parents who emigrated to @entity138 when he was 12 years old			2
he landed in western @entity65 with the first name of @entity334 , but he spoke fluent @entity140 and @entity141			1
@entity8 also spoke @entity142 at home and remained fluent in the language as he grew up , graduating from high school and later the @entity338 , in 1981			2
he rose quickly through the ranks			0

in 2004 , was appointed chief of the @entity352 's gangs squad			0
in the same year , he was seconded for the first time to @entity42 , as @entity354 , @entity355 , and later as deputy chief police adviser to the @entity357 , and spent eight months training @entity42 police			2
on his return in 2006 , when @entity8 was promoted to @entity17 assistant commissioner in charge of counter terrorism and public order management , he said a terrorist attack in @entity138 was likely			1
' @entity138 is very much part of the international community and if something happens in @entity311 or @entity42 , we have to accept that it has an impact over here , ' he said at the time			0
in 2009 , @entity8 was seconded to the @entity371 for the @entity372 investigating the assassination of @entity71 , the @entity72 prime minister who was blown up in a @entity375 motorcade in 2005			0
