by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:34 est , 25 february 2014 first lady @entity3 attempted to connect with schoolchildren across the country by rapping about healthy eating habits as she announced new rules that would limit the marketing of unhealthy foods in schools			1
the rules would phase out the advertising of sugary drinks and junk foods around campuses during the school day and ensure that other promotions in schools were in line with health standards that already apply to school foods			1
cups , posters and menu boards which promote foods that do n't meet the standards would also be phased out			1
ninety percent of such marketing in schools is related to beverages , and many soda companies already have started to transition their sales and advertising in schools from sugary sodas and sports drinks to their own healthier products			1

mrs. @entity3 and agriculture secretary @entity120 announced the new rules at a @entity39 event			2
' the idea here is simple — our classrooms should be healthy places where kids are n't bombarded with ads for junk food , ' the first lady said in a statement released before the announcement			1
" because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home , their work should n't be undone by unhealthy messages at school			2
' the rules also would allow more children access to free lunches and ensure that schools have wellness policies in place			0
the proposed rules come on the heels of @entity42 regulations that are now requiring foods in the school lunch line to be healthier			1
rules set to go into effect next school year will make other foods around school healthier as well , including in vending machines and separate ' a la carte ' lines in the lunch room			1

banned : under the proposed rules , companies would be limited in what products they could advertise on signs , vending machines , cups and menu boards on school grounds down the kids : first lady @entity3 recites a ' wrap ' song written by students about healthy eating as she announced proposed guidelines for local school wellness policies aware of the backlash , the @entity42 is allowing schools to make some of their own decisions on what constitutes marketing and asking for comments on some options			1
for example , the proposal asks for comments on initiatives like @entity202 's ' book it ' program , which coordinates with schools to reward kids with pizza for reading			2
rules for other school fundraisers , like bake sales and marketing for those events , would be left up to schools or states			2
off - campus fundraisers , like an event at a local fast - food outlet that benefits a school , still would be permitted			2
but posters advertising the fast food may not be allowed in school hallways			0
an email to parents — with or without the advertising — would have to suffice			0
the idea is to market to the parents , not the kids			0
the rule also makes allowances for major infrastructure costs — that scoreboard advertising @entity26 , for example , would n't have to be immediately torn down			0
but the school would have to get one with a healthier message the next time it was replaced			0
positive marketing only : @entity234 is the exclusive beverage in city public schools as well as at parks and other public areas			0
for $ 166 million @entity234 will promote @entity239 - all over a five year period , with most money going to the schools )			1
only water and juices will be sold in the schools the beverage industry — led by @entity31 , dr. @entity247 and @entity249 — is on board with the move			0

" " mrs. @entity3 's efforts to continue to strengthen school wellness make sense for the well - being of our schoolchildren , " @entity252 said			1
although mrs. @entity3 lobbied @entity266 to pass the school nutrition bill in 2010 , most of her efforts in recent years have been focused on the private sector , building partnerships with food companies and retailers to sell healthier foods			1
meeting of minds : agriculture secretary @entity120 , left , introduces @entity274 , from @entity275 , @entity75 , who is co-founder and president of @entity278 , and her son @entity279 , before first lady @entity3 announced proposed guidelines for local school wellness policies the child nutrition law also expanded feeding programs for hungry students			1
the rules being proposed tuesday would increase that even further by allowing the highest - poverty schools to serve lunch and breakfast to all students for free			2
according to the @entity42 and the @entity39 , that initiative would allow 9 million children in 22,000 schools to receive free lunches			0
the @entity42 has already tested the program , which is designed to increase participation for students and reduce paperwork and applications for schools , in 11 states			0
in addition , the @entity3 administration will announce new guidelines for school wellness policies			0
schools have been required to have general wellness policies that set their own general standards for foods , physical activity and other wellness activities since 2004			0
but the new rules would require parents and others in the school community to be involved in those decisions .			0
