@entity0 , 73 , was given just a four per cent chance of survival and spent six days in intensive care , fighting for her life after the ordeal a pensioner suffering a brain anerusym was given just a four per cent chance of survival after being refused an ambulance by the dedicated @entity12 computer system			1
@entity14 's husband @entity13 called 999 after she woke at 2am with an excruciating pain in her head and started drifting in and out of consciousness			1
but she was not deemed an emergency and later spent six days in hospital fighting for her life			1
despite attempting to outline the seriousness of the situation , mr @entity20 was told by the call operator that it was n't necessary to rush his 73 - year - old wife to hospital and advised him to call out their doctor			1
a nurse from the local gp practice came out at breakfast time and almost immediately told mr @entity20 to drive his wife to hospital as it would be quicker than waiting for an ambulance			1
by the time the pensioner arrived at hospital she was unconscious			1
she underwent emergency surgery and spent six days in intensive care after being diagnosed with a ruptured brain aneurysm			1
doctors later told her she had been given just a four per cent chance of survival			0
mrs @entity0 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , is the second person to slam the @entity12 's so - called ' computer says no ' triage system it uses to assess emergency cases			1
last week the widow of taxi driver @entity48 spoke out after he was refused an ambulance by the same ambulance - only to be rushed to hospital eight hours later and died of heart failure			2
the ambulance service 's triage system involves a call handler asking the person questions about their condition and inputting the answers into a computer which ' listens out ' for key words and decides whether to send an ambulance			1
despite the @entity12 website describing a ruptured brain aneurysm as a ' medical emergency ' and mrs @entity0 describing two of the four main symptoms to the operator , the @entity62 maintains it was right to refer her to the out - of - hours gp service			1
mrs @entity0 said : ' i woke up with the most terrible pain and asked my husband to call an ambulance			1
i was very aware that it was not a normal headache , we told them about the pain and the stiff neck			0
' the operator insisted on speaking to me even though i was going in and out of consciousness and then they said they would n't send an ambulance			0
' i did n't answer in what they considered the right way so i did n't tick the right boxes that would make them come out			0
but neither of us remember them offering the out - of - hours gp service			1
in a written reply , ambulance trust bosses admitted the handling mr @entity20 's 999 call had fallen well short of standards and apologised for the lapse in service			1
' i was told so many times in hospital i should have died and how lucky i was			0
i had a four per cent chance of living and my doctor said it was as serious as it gets			0
if that is n't an emergency i do n't know what is			0
' i ca n't fault the doctors and nurses , they were superb , but i 'm upset with the ambulance service			0
all the delay because they did n't come out caused a lot of problems			0
' i learned of @entity48 's case and realised it was almost identical to what i had experienced			0
i did n't know until then that the decision was made by a computer and i was totally outraged			0
' i do n't think the general public are aware that these decisions are made by a computer			0
it 's entirely ridiculous to judge humans like this and not help someone if they do n't tick the right boxes			0
' i was lucky but the other poor woman lost her husband			0
it 's just wrong that this system is in place			0
' following mrs @entity0 's ordeal her husband @entity13 wrote to @entity134 to complain about their treatment of his wife			1
@entity138 is a software used by the @entity12 to to classify public calls for medical care and emergency medical services - such as 999 or 112 calls			2
it is used by six ambulance trusts in the @entity146			0
the main idea behind the system is to reduce unnecessary call - outs for emergency services			2
it is diagnosed to deal with any health problem and refer the patient to the appropriate service the idea is that any healthcare problem can be triaged by any arm of the @entity12 - emergency or non-emergency - and can be directed to any possible health care provider without the need for a second triage on referral , or any delay			2
in a written reply , trust bosses admitted the handling mr @entity20 's 999 call had fallen well short of their standards and apologised for the lapse in service			1
the letter read : ' the triage of the 999 call for your wife has been carefully reviewed and audited by the @entity62 's qi team who have determined that the actions of the @entity178 taking the call did not meet the expected standard			1
' to pass a quality audit , the triage of a 999 call must achieve a percentage ' score ' of 86 per cent			2
' the 999 call for your wife achieved 59 per cent , significantly lower than the standards expected by the @entity62 and i would like to specifically apologise again for the standard of this service			2
' in a press statement , the @entity62 said : ' @entity134 is sorry that mr @entity20 felt the need to complain about the service he received following a 999 call for his wife back in may this year			1
' @entity194 acknowledges that some aspects of the call could have been handled better and actions have been taken to address this			0
however , the outcome of assessing mrs @entity0 ’s symptoms was that an out - of - hours @entity201 should call within two hours			1
' this was the correct and appropriate response to the call , which @entity20 and mrs @entity0 chose not to accept			1
' the triage system ( @entity138 ) used by our 999 call - handlers is a robust , national system , designed by clinicians to determine the most appropriate care pathway for patients			1
' emergency ambulances are for immediately life - threatening emergencies only			2
if a patient is not thought to be suffering a life - threatening emergency , they can be re-triaged by a clinician ( paramedic , emergency care practitioner , nurse or sometimes a doctor ) in the control room to ensure that patient receives the right level of care for their current symptoms and condition			1
' if it is deemed that a patient needs to speak with an out - of - hours @entity201 , this will be organised by the @entity62 – there is no expectation for the patient to make that arrangement themselves			2
' callers are always advised to call back on 999 if the patient ’s condition deteriorates			2
' the family of a man who died after he was refused an ambulance claimed last week he lost his life because an @entity12 ‘ computer said no ’			2
taxi driver @entity48 dialled 999 at 5am he was finding it hard to breathe			0
but after putting his details into a computer an operator told him he did not need an ambulance			2
@entity48 , 55 , died after being refused an ambulance - despite telling the operator he was struggling to breathe the 55 - year - old , a former merchant seaman , had been ill for three weeks and had seen five doctors about swelling after a change in his blood pressure medication			2
it has now emerged he did not give the answers that ‘ trigger ’ the need for an ambulance and was told to contact his gp instead			0
mr @entity48 died four days later , on september 1			0
a post-mortem examination found fluid around his body had caused heart failure			0
his family demanded to know why an ambulance had not been sent in the first place , from a station just three minutes from his home in @entity270 , @entity42			0
they were told a computer system had decided neither an ambulance nor immediate hospital admission was necessary			1
the ‘ computer says no ’ catchphrase was coined by comedian @entity277 in the @entity279 ’s @entity278 , in which a worker inputs data and then informs a customer they can not be helped .			0

@entity14 's husband @entity13 called 999 when she woke suffering an excruciating pain in her head and drifted in and out of consciousness
@entity134 did not deem her an emergency
mr @entity20 was advised to call out their gp to come and see his wife
a nurse from the local practice visited and told him to drive mrs @entity0 to hospital straight away
by the time she arrived at hospital @entity20 , 73 , was unconscious
doctors diagnosed her as suffering a ruptured brain aneurysm
she had emergency surgery and spent six days fighting for her life
mrs @entity0 has since slammed the trust 's ' computer says no ' triage system
ambulance bosses accepted mr @entity20 's call could *'ve* been handled better
but claim @entity20 and mrs @entity0 ignored their advice to see an out - of - hours gp within two hours - the right response to mrs @entity0 's condition , they say
