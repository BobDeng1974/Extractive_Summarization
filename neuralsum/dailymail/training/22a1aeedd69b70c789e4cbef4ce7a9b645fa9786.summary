the decision by defence lawyers to apply to have the case against @entity2 dismissed - under section 174 of the @entity33 - was not unexpected following a series of blows to prosecution			1
one of the compelling elements in the case against @entity2 was motive – the fact that he had a secret gay life was , prosecutors concluded , a powerful reason for wanting to be out of his new marriage			1
however , when on day one of the trial , @entity2 informed the court that he was bi-sexual and frequented male prostitutes , clubs , chat rooms and extreme websites – much of the evidence compiled by the state relating to @entity2 's sexuality was later ruled inadmissible by the judge			2
a gay escort , called ' the @entity57 master , ' whom @entity2 had paid for three sex sessions , involving drugs , physical and verbal abuse and role play , was allowed to give only brief live testimony			2
a bundle of sexually - explicit emails between @entity2 and an unnamed older lover were also ruled inadmissible			2
testimony from the @entity70 bride 's first cousin and confidante , @entity72 , was also excluded following a successful application by defence lawyers			0
lawyers @entity75 and @entity76 were also successful in highlighting discrepancies in the evidence of ' star ' prosecution witnesses – taxi driver @entity80 and hitman @entity81			0
@entity80 told the court he had been recruited by @entity2 to organise the contract killing of his new wife , within minutes of dropping the newlyweds at their honeymoon hotel			2
@entity81 told the court that he had been hired by @entity80 who said he had ' a husband who wanted his wife killed			0
' victim : @entity91 was found killed by a bullet through her neck after the cab she was riding in with her husband on their honeymoon in @entity99 was hijacked as it travelled through a township their word : hitman @entity81 , left , and taxi driver @entity80 , right , were prosecution witnesses prosecutors brought their case to a sudden close following a meeting in which the two sides led to agreement on evidence related to calls and messages between @entity2 , @entity80 and the hitmen and also the results of primer residue tests			1
a source close to the defence said the decision to apply for the case to be discharged ' is never made lightly ' , but added ' we would n't apply for a discharge unless we had some confidence about our chances of success			0
' the family of mrs @entity91 – who marked the fourth anniversary of her death last week with a visit to the township road where she was found dead from a fatal gun shot wound to the neck – looked tense and anxious as the court was adjourned			0
the defence will compile written arguments in favour of having the case against @entity2 discharged and submit them to the judge by the end of wednesday			1

the judge will hear the arguments in open court on monday - after that , she could announce her decision straight away , or ask for time to consider .			0
