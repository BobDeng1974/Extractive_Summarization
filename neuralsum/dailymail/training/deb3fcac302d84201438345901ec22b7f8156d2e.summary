by @entity0 a young date palm named @entity2 has blossomed for the third time after a 2,000 - year old seed was planted eight years ago			1
the ancient seeds , one of which has produced @entity2 , were discovered in a clay jar at the site of @entity11 's fortified palace in @entity12 , @entity13 in 1973			1
while the seeds languished in a drawer of @entity17 's @entity16 for years , one was eventually planted in 2005 and have proved sceptics wrong after producing a seedling - effectively resurrecting a plant last seen in @entity21 times			1
the only example of a @entity23 located at @entity24 , @entity13			2
it was germinated in 2005 from a 2000 year - old seed found in the @entity28 excavations , and is nicknamed @entity2			1
botanical researcher @entity29 said it looks similar to its modern relatives apart from the length of its third leaf botanical researcher @entity29 with help from the @entity37 at @entity38 in @entity39 , sowed the seed that has now produced the rare and ancient plant			1
she told @entity42 : ' when we asked if we could try and grow some of them , they said , " you 're mad , " but they gave us three seeds			0
' ' lotus seeds over 1,000 years old have been sprouted , and i realised that no one had done any similar work with dates , so why not give it our best shot and we were rewarded			0
' the researcher planed the seed as soon as she received it and it blossomed for the first time in 2011			0
the ruins of the @entity59 are pictured - a geological mesa at the edge of the @entity62 that rises in 1300 foot cliffs above the level of the @entity65			0
@entity11 began developing palaces , fortifications , and storehouses on @entity59 in 37 @entity69 and the ancient seeds were found at the site @entity28 is an ancient fortification in the @entity73 of @entity13 situated on top of an isolated rock plateau ( akin to a mesa ) on the eastern edge of the @entity62 , overlooking the @entity65			2
@entity11 built palaces for himself on the mountain and fortified @entity28 between 37 and 31 @entity69			0
the @entity79 by troops of the @entity81 towards the end of the @entity83 â€“ @entity84 ended in the mass suicide of the 960 @entity83 rebels and their families hiding there			0
@entity28 is located 12 miles east of @entity88 and is @entity13 's most popular paid tourist attraction			2
the site of @entity28 was identified in 1842 and extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by @entity13 archeologist @entity92			2
due to the remoteness from human habitation and its arid environment , the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia			0
while it looks very similar to modern date palms , the tree has some unusual leaves			1
dr @entity29 said : ' the only difference between this date seedling and any other date seedlings i 've seen come up is the length of the third leaf			1
she plans on cross-breeding the plant with modern close relatives			0
the young date palm has been called @entity2 after a biblical story about the oldest person who ever lived			1
the @entity115 reported seeing groves of the trees in the @entity119 valley , which stretched to the @entity120 and the @entity65 , which made the area wealthy			0
in ancient literature , the judean date , which is produced by the palm variety is said to have medicinal properties			1
it was used as an aphrodisiac and contraceptive , as well as treatment for toothaches and malaria , as well as cancer			0
the ancient @entity133 referred to the palm variety as the ' tree of life ' because of the food and shade it produced .			2

the seed that produced the young date palm was planted in 2005 by @entity29 and the @entity37
sceptics had *doubted* the 2,000 - year - old seed , discovered at @entity12 , @entity13 in 1973 could produce a tree
the only difference between the ancient date seedling and modern date seedlings is the length of the third leaf , which an expert says is unusual
