the woman behind @entity1 , @entity3 's friendly voice - activated virtual ' assistant , ' has finally been revealed			1
@entity4 , a voice - over actor from suburban @entity5 , @entity6 , laid down hours of nonsensical recordings for an unknown client eight years ago ; little did she know , she would soon be speaking to more than 100million people once @entity1 was introduced with the @entity10 on october 4 , 2011			1
for four hours a day during the entire month of july 2005 , mrs @entity4 , 64 , read hundreds of phrases and sentences that enabled @entity3 to pull out vowels , consonants , syllables and diphthongs ; before playing with her pitch and speed			1
for me , i get extremely bored ... so i just take breaks			0
that 's one of the reasons why @entity1 might sometimes sound like she has a bit of an attitude , ' mrs @entity4 told @entity33			1
' those sounds might have been recorded the last 15 minutes of those four hours			2
' while @entity3 wo n't confirm that mrs @entity4 is @entity1 , professionals who know her voice , including those who represents her legally , say she is @entity1			1
an audio - forensics expert with 30 years of experience also studied both voices and confirms that she is ' 100per cent ' @entity1			2
mrs @entity4 revealed her identity during an interview with @entity33 that was unrelated to @entity1 or @entity3 , something she says she did n't take lightly			1
while @entity3 wo n't confirm that mrs @entity4 is @entity1 , an audio - forensics expert and professionals who know her voice , including those who represents her legally , say that she is ' 100per cent ' @entity1 when @entity48 , a software company looking for a voice for a new project , asked mrs @entity4 to record phrases to be used in a database to construct speech , she had no idea how her voice would eventually be used ' i really had to weigh the importance of it for me personally			1
i was n't sure that i wanted that notoriety , and i also was n't sure where i stood legally , ' she admitted			0
' and so , consequently , i was very conservative about it for a long time			0
and then this @entity61 video came out ... and it seemed like everyone was clamoring to find out who the real voice behind @entity1 is , and so i thought , well , you know , what the heck ? this is the time			2
' @entity1 , @entity3 's friendly voice - activated virtual ' assistant , ' was introduced with the @entity10 on october 4 , 2011 mrs @entity4 fell into voice work by accident in the @entity73			1
today , she speaks in commercials and on countless phone systems			0
she also spells out directions from @entity78 devices , and greets travelers in @entity81 airport terminals			0
but in 2005 , when @entity48 , a software company looking for a voice for a new project , asked mrs @entity4 to sign a contract offering her voice for recordings that would be used in a database to construct speech , she had no idea how her voice would eventually be used			1
when @entity3 released its @entity10 , the first to feature @entity1 , mrs @entity4 was alerted to her familiar voice by friends and family			1
' a colleague e-mailed me [ about @entity1 ] and said , " hey , we 've been playing around with this new @entity3 phone			2
is n't this you ? " ' so mrs @entity4 pulled up @entity3 's website and listened to video clips announcing @entity1			1
' it 's obviously me			0
it 's my voice , ' she said			2
when her son , @entity105 , a photographer in @entity106 , saw an @entity10 commercial on television , he said he was flummoxed seeing director @entity109 talking to his mother			0
then when @entity105 bought the phone himself , she began guiding him on its gps feature			0
' her voice has been everywhere throughout my life			0
i 'd call my bank while i was in college in @entity118 , and it was my mom telling me i had $ 4 , ' he said			0
so why wo n't @entity3 confirm mrs @entity4 as @entity1 's voice ? @entity121 , ceo of @entity122 , which represents mrs @entity4 , says that ' companies are competing to create the best - sounding and functioning systems			1
when her son , @entity105 , a photographer in @entity106 , saw an @entity10 commercial on television , he said he was flummoxed seeing director @entity109 talking to his mother			0
' their concern is driving revenues			0
talking about the voice talent , from their perspective , is likely seen as a distraction			0
' mrs @entity4 's attorney , @entity134 , said that since he began representing her last year , he has ' engaged in substantial negotiations -- multiple , months - long negotiations -- with parties along the economic food chain , so to speak , that involved her rendering services as the voice of @entity1			1
' and then there 's @entity121 , of @entity122 , a man who has built a career around providing voice over talent for interactive voice technologies			2
@entity145 , a member of the @entity146 from @entity147 who has analyzed ' hundreds , if not thousands ' of recordings in court hearings , said he spent four hours studying @entity1 and mrs @entity4 's voice			1
' they are identical -- a 100per cent match , he said after creating back - to - back comparison files			0
and after asking a second opinion , for the ' importance of accuracy , ' he said : ' rest assured : it 's 100 % @entity4			2

@entity4 , a voice - over actor from @entity5 , @entity6 , recorded hundreds of phrases and sentences during july 2005
