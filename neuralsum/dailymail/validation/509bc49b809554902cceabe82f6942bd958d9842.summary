' i was a child			0
it was in a public lavatory at @entity14			1
i did n’t know the person			0
i ran , ' he told the @entity17			2
' i made it very clear that i did n’t appreciate it			0
i would have shouted and yelled			0
laws criticised @entity24 for not fighting the attacker off and called him a ' wet blanket '			1
but the radio veteran has defended his comments and said he did not think he had treated @entity24 insensitively			1
the interview earlier this month stirred an outrage among listeners , with some calling for his resignation over the comments			0
but @entity43 rebuked claims he had no sympathy for those who had been abused and said his reaction to @entity24 's story stemmed from how he had handled his own experience			1
@entity24 called laws during his morning radio show on @entity52 earlier this month and told him about his sexual abuse he said his attacker was someone he did not know and he was left disturbed by the abuse , adding he would have made it ' very clear ' he did not appreciate it by shouting and yelling			1
the broadcaster said his advice to @entity24 would have been how he would have reacted in the same situation , describing it as ' tough love '			1
when contacted by @entity65 , laws did not wish to comment further on the matter			2
the shock jock called the elderly man a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade ' in a 10 - minute call , @entity24 told laws about how he had been sexually abused on several occasions from the age of 11 to 14 live on @entity10 radio station @entity52			1
laws quipped and chuckled it ' took a little while for you to get around to talk about it '			2
@entity24 then told laws he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to ' go away and forget about it			1
no one would do anything about it '			0
it was at this stage , @entity0 added insult to injury as he told @entity24 that he should have fought the man off , as he himself had done when men had ' had a go ' at him when he was younger			1
' did you scream in fright ? did you yell out ' stop that you bastard ' ? did you lash out with your fists ? did you hit him ? ' @entity0 asked			2
the call outraged people on social media who called for the radio presenter 's sacking after the call a meek sounding @entity24 responded ' no , no probably not			1
' ' i do n't quite understand why you did n't lash out , you would have been a fairly big boy by that time			0
did n't you kick or yell or scream or hit ? ' laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss , who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults			2
@entity24 began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support			2
. there was no such thing as ... family love , ' @entity24 said			2
he explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend , no romantic interests and very little human contact			2
laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest			0
@entity24 responded he was ' sad more than anything '			2
laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of ' both of their time			0
' former @entity133 star @entity132 wants @entity24 to know that he is not alone and people do care @entity24 continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks , trying to minimise human contact when @entity0 thought it prudent to offer @entity24 some more sound advice			1
' have you ever stopped and asked yourself , why do n't people like me ? but this is not the first time , laws has been met with controversy			0
in 2013 , he referred to women who dressed provocatively as ' rape bait ' ' you 're not the happiest soul , i do n't know that you 'd make people who are around you feel all that good			0
have you tried to brighten up a little ? difficult i know			0
' do you hear me ? but you 're not taking any notice			0
' you 've got to be responsible for your own activity			0
you must make the move , go and talk to somebody about it			0
' but do n't be down all the time , do n't be a wet blanket all the time			1
try and have a laugh			0
' go to the pub and have a lemonade for @entity165 's sake			0
he was met with silence			0
' no ? well there 's not a lot more i can do , is there ? ' to wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation @entity0 asked @entity24 to thank him for his time			1
' @entity24 , could you say thank you ? ' the interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation @entity43 had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse			1
laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were ' rape bait '			2
@entity184 has erupted in support for @entity24 as listeners call for the so - called radio magnate to be sacked			1
@entity132 , the former co-star of @entity133 ! who was among actor @entity188 ’ child sex abuse victims , chimed into show support for @entity24 and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care			1
she added @entity43 needs ' genuine help ' after listening to the insensitive call .			0
