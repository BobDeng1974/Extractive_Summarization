by @entity1 reporter published : 19:47 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 10 december 2013 heartbroken : @entity2 , 16 , died five months after being diagnosed with cancer a mother grappling with the death of her 16 - year - old daughter from cancer has now had to deal with a mysterious fundraising page from a girl that she has never met			1
@entity2 died on december 4 following a five - month battle with cancer , and now her family has discovered a @entity15 page claiming to be collecting funds for her funeral but they had never been contacted with the page 's creator			1
the girl who made the memorial page that solicited donations has not been named publicly , but she claims that she is a friend of a friend of @entity2 's			1
the girl denied any wrong doing , but since she was contacted by both @entity2 's godfather and a local news station , she has changed her story multiple times			1
originally , the @entity15 page said that it would collect money - cash or checks - that would either be donated to @entity29 in @entity30 where @entity2 was treated or they would go to the funeral home though it did not specify the name of the home			1
' i do n't know the that family very well but i knew @entity2 that â€™s why i decided to do this on my own as a fundraier ... it the family wants to make a fundraiser that is up to them , ' read a typo - riddled message posted by the creator on the page			2
' it was more of a friend to friend thing trying to raise money and awareness , thats why all the money will go twds [ sic ] her funeral as well as childrens hospital so i do n't want it written out to the family just so i know exactly where the money goes			2
' i said " who are you going to make the payment to ? " she said the funeral home and i said " well , which funeral home ? " and she said " well , well " and did n't have an answer and i said " you know what ? this does n't seem right , " ' mr @entity86 said			0
the station then contacted the girl herself and she maintained that her intentions were heart - felt			0
' i 'm not just gon na hand the money over to her mother			0
i do n't know how her family is or what they will use it for ! ok ! ' the girl wrote in @entity15 messages with the @entity70 reporter			0
' this is really hurtful and degrading to be put down as if i 'm doing something bad			0
all the money will be donated in memory of @entity2 to @entity29			0
' unanswered questions : the girl who created the @entity15 page , who has not been publicly named , claims that she was friends with @entity2 and is now holding a toy drive in her honor suspicious : @entity2 's godfather @entity69 called the girl behind the @entity15 post and said she had no explanation for where the money would go and did not know the name of the funeral home the girl has since changed the venue again , collecting toys and cash at a local hair salon allegedly in @entity2 's honor			1
@entity2 's mother remains sketeptical , saying that it appears odd that the girl would have felt to motivated to start her own fundraiser but then not even try contacting the relatives to give condolences			2
' if you are going to go to that extent , then you would go to that extent to contact the family , ' @entity62 told @entity70			0
now the @entity2 family has started their own fundraising effort - having not had any further contact with the girl or seen any of the money that she was trying to raise - in order to have enough money to give the teenager a proper burial			2

@entity2 , 16 , died of cancer on december 4 in @entity30
days later a @entity15 memorial page was started by a girl claiming to be @entity2 's friend , collecting money for the funeral but not knowing the name of the funeral home
the family said they have never been contacted by the creator and they called her to question her about her motives
