@entity2 jihadis fighting in @entity3 and @entity4 will have their passports cancelled for at least two years to prevent them returning to wreak terror in the @entity2 , @entity0 announced on thursday evening			1
@entity7 said the plans would give @entity2 the toughest anti-jihadi powers in the @entity11 world outside the @entity12 , and would ensure fighters were only let back in to the @entity2 ‘ on our terms ’			1
however , they will place ministers on collision course with judges and human rights lawyers			0
and they risk infuriating allies such as @entity21 and @entity22 , which could find themselves having to deal with @entity2 extremists stranded abroad			1
@entity0 's plans would see @entity25 ( crouching , second from right ) have his passport cancelled for two years after he fled to @entity3 to fight for @entity28 the prime minister ’s announcement came as he outlined a raft of new measures to counter the threat posed by @entity35 fanatics in a speech to the @entity38 parliament in @entity39			1
he is about to embark on talks with world leaders at the @entity43 summit in @entity38 on tackling so - called foreign fighters			1
the measures also include plans to streamline existing powers to confiscate the passports of @entity2 thought to be planning to travel to @entity3			1
they will also be extended to under - 18s for the first time to combat the threat posed by teenage jihadis			1
and airlines will be warned that they could be fined or have their licences to operate in the @entity2 revoked unless they co-operate fully with the security services to identify and prevent banned suspects from boarding flights home			2
but it is the introduction of ‘ temporary exclusion orders ’ that will prove the most controversial			0
on the orders of home secretary @entity62 , legal papers will be served to a suspect ’s last - known address in the @entity2 and they will be placed immediately on international ‘ no - fly ’ lists			1
any airline that allows a suspect to board a plane to the @entity2 could find its aircraft turned back			2
and any banned individuals who manage to sneak back into @entity2 would commit an offence carrying a five - year jail term			1
@entity0 made the announcement in @entity38 , where he has met the country 's prime minister @entity74 the order could also be extended indefinitely if they are still deemed a threat after two years			1
individuals who insist on returning to @entity2 will be permitted to do so without a passport – but only under strict police supervision			2
detectives will be sent to accompany them home , where they could face prosecution or surveillance			0
those who refuse these terms will be effectively marooned abroad without a passport – probably in a so - called transit country , such as @entity21 or @entity22			2
@entity7 last night said diplomatic talks were continuing with these countries about how these individuals should then be dealt with			2
the plan is designed to get round international laws that prevent the @entity2 stripping the citizenship of @entity2 subjects and rendering them stateless , which had been mr @entity0 ’s initial plan			1
it will be included in a new @entity98 , which will be published this month and rushed through @entity99 by the end of january			2
a spokesman said that attorney general @entity102 had signed off the measures as being consistent with international law			2
but they risk being caught up in a legal minefield			0
former attorney general @entity107 has warned that removing passports from @entity2 citizens abroad is ‘ likely to be a non-starter ’			1
the woman dubbed the ‘ @entity113 ’ in a landmark terrorism case has claimed the public think she was cleared because of her looks			0
@entity116 , 27 , earned her nickname after she posted photos online of the glamorous outfits she would be wearing to her trial			0
the university student even decorated the electronic tag on her ankle with jewels			0
she was eventually acquitted of trying to smuggle £ 16,500 in her underwear to a jihadi fighter			0
@entity116 ( right ) , dubbed the ' @entity113 ' , spoke for the first time since she was acquitted of smuggling £ 16,500 in cash to a jihadi fighter , but her friend @entity132 ( left ) was jailed yesterday , as miss @entity116 spoke out for the first time since her acquittal , her friend @entity132 was jailed for two years and four months for arranging to transport cash to her 30 - year - old husband @entity25 , a @entity137 convert fighting with @entity138			0
it is the first prosecution in @entity2 of funding terrorism in @entity3			1
miss @entity116 , a muslim , complained of sexist treatment in the media and said she has received abuse from the @entity137 community and threats of sexual violence on social networking sites for the way she dressed during her trial			0
‘ a lot of people think that i ’m the smuggler who got away with it , that the jury only let me off because of my looks , ’ she told @entity151			0
‘ i was supposed to be a jihadi , but there i was dressed in skirts and matching blazers			0
many people could n’t handle this			0
‘ i was getting stick from the @entity165 , from people really bothered by the way i dress , sending me messages that i should cover up			0

@entity0 's plan will *strengthen* @entity2 's anti-jihadi powers
fighters will only return to the @entity2 ' on our terms ' , @entity7 says
move may anger allies who could end up with stranded @entity2 extremists
jihadists planning on going to @entity3 will also have passports removed
measures will be extended to include under - 18s to combat teenage threat
