a @entity1 couple believe they 've captured the legendary ' goat sucker ' beast el chupacabra			1
@entity6 and her husband @entity7 discovered the hairless , growling creature eating corn outside their @entity12 home on sunday and decided it could be but one thing			1
' he called me to come and look , and i said " @entity7 that looks like a baby chupacabra , ” ' @entity6 said			1
but its wrinkly black skin and bulbous eyes still lend it a look of menace			2
the couple have kept the thing in a cage and have been feeding it and making sure it has water to drink			0
they 've also given friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek			2
neighbor @entity47 spoke from experience when he concluded it 's likely the blood sucking chupacabra			0
' i hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and i ai n’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there , ' @entity57 told @entity58			0
' we 've never seen anything like it before ' : the couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can id it @entity6 shows where she first happened on the animal she thinks is a chupacabra ' i hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and i ai n’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there , ' said the @entity75 ' neighbor @entity47 and his identification was n't just based on looks : ' a coon does n’t make that noise , or a possum			1
what makes that noise ? i guess a chupacabra does , ' @entity47 said			0
@entity6 and her husband say they have kept the animal in a cage , not to harm it , but out of curiosity			1
' we were just trying to figure out what it is because we 've never seen anything like it before , ' @entity6 said			2
no chupacabra has ever been positively identified , of course , and if the @entity98 's find is ever @entity100 'd , it will likely be as a mammal , possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out			0
the stocks are feeding the animal and making sure it has plenty of water mangy ? many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange legend of @entity19 the word comes from two @entity119 words - ' chupar ' , to suck , and ' cabra ' , goat			1
the first reported sighting was in 1995 , when eight sheep were found dead in @entity123 with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood			1
thus , the legend of the livestock killing , vampire - like chupacabra was born			0
since then , the legendary beast has been spotted across the @entity131 and even the world			1
a @entity134 incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on @entity19 in 2012			1
earlier this year , yet another @entity137 sighting came when a @entity139 man actually shot and killed what he claimed was @entity19			2
even a @entity142 town had a @entity19 sighting this past july science attempts to explain scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be @entity19 are actually wildlife like coyotes , foxes , and stray dogs infested with parasites			2
most commonly pointed to is the parasite @entity154 , which causes mange			0
@entity156 is a painful , potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel , making for an even more ghoulish looking beast			0
in humans , @entity154 causes scabies and a consequent itchy , painful rash as the parasites burrow around , leaving their feces under the skin			0
' goat sucker ' : the legend of @entity19 likely originates from a 1995 case in @entity123 where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds			1
it has been described as hairless , or as having spines along its back , and as having blue or red eyes			0

a man in @entity12 , @entity1 has caught a *smallish* , black *critter* that he believes is the legendary beast
the story of @entity19 began in @entity123 when *farmers* found their goats dead and drained of all their blood
while @entity6 and her husband @entity7 think they 've *bagged* the *mythical* animal , some believe they have a raccoon with mange
