fishermen have caught 25 dolphins from a pod of more than 250 being held captive on the coast of @entity5 , it is claimed			1
the bottlenose dolphins , including one very young and rare albino dolphin worth millions , have been selected for a life of captivity in aquariums and marine parks ahead of a ' mass slaughter ' , according to environmentalists			1
those that have n't been taken will either be selected tomorrow , or stabbed to death for meat			0
above , one of the animals is hauled into a boat by @entity5 fishermen taken : @entity38 drag one of the selected dolphins onto a boat			1
the animal will either be transferred to the @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity45 , or kept in a harbour holding pen until its fate is decided caught : a total of 25 dolphins , including the one above , were captured during the eight - hour selection process the brutal selection follows an international outcry , with thousands of people having taken to social networking sites during the past 24 hours to express their anger and disgust at the process			1
local fisherman and dolphin trainers arrived at a cove in the village of @entity22 , on the south - west coast of @entity5 , shortly after 7am today , according to militant environmental group @entity64			1
the dolphins had already been forced to endure an agonising 19 - hour wait - with eye - witnesses reporting that the animals could be seen ' thrashing around ' in the cramped cove			2

above , a @entity76 user expresses her sadness ' heartbreaking ' : thousands of people having taken to social networking sites during the past 24 hours brutal process : the @entity76 hashtag # tweet4taiji was trending across the world throughout the day controversial : the dolphins had already been forced to endure an agonising 19 - hour wait - with eye - witnesses reporting that the animals could be seen ' thrashing around ' in the water			2
above , fisherman capture a dolphin heavy load : the animals were dragged onto surrounding boats by scuba divers using nets , tarp and wire uncertain fate : dolphins that were n't taken will either be selected tomorrow , or stabbed to death for meat they were dragged onto surrounding boats by scuba divers using nets , tarp and wire			1
among the captives was the albino dolphin , which is believed to have been immediately transported to the @entity106			1
albino bottlenose dolphins are extremely rare , and are worth considerable money to marine parks as spectator items and entertainment			2
the other captives have either been transferred to the @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity45 , or are being kept in a harbour holding pen			1
however , one of the dolphins is believed to have died while being transferred to the pen - with its carcass , instead , being taken straight to a nearby butcher 's house			1
sad : the body of dolphin believed to have died during the selection process is transferred to a butcher 's house horrific scene : if the remaining dolphins that escape captivity are not killed , they will be ' driven ' back to the open ocean by ' banger boats ' that force them to travel out to sea using long poles attached to the boat 's sides harsh conditions : these poles are deployed above the water , and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer , creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea the remaining animals will meet their fate - either a life of captivity or death by spear - tomorrow			1

these poles are deployed above the water , and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer - creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea			0
this is the same tactic that the fisherman use to push the dolphins into the cove and capture them			0
those driven back to sea will likely be very young , and will not have the guidance of the elders that have been killed or captured , making them very unlikely to survive			0
annual process : the fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250 - strong pod rounded up : the dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass heavy machinery : fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea , on its way to either lifetime captivity or death for the past couple of days , @entity64 has been streaming live footage of the cove , which was made famous in the @entity195 - winning film @entity196 , which documented the entire process from capture , to selection , to aftermath			1
the footage has sparked outrage among people across the world - with # tweet4taiji trending on @entity76 throughout the day			0

' boat : ' @entity261 ' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds , driving the dolphins to specific places preparation : fishermen and trainers unload the orange nets yesterday - just 24 hours before decision day action : the scuba divers and boat drivers , left , are , for the most part , a selection of fishermen from the @entity277			2
@entity278 , one of the dolphin fences inside the cove that allows the fishermen to stand watch today , @entity64 said in a statement : ' those taken captive are forced to watch as the remaining members of their family are brutally killed for human consumption			2
' every year the fishermen of @entity22 corral hundreds of dolphins into a secluded bay , select a few dozen for sale to aquariums and marine parks , and stab the rest to death for meat			1
the marine parks in @entity5 are modeled after the @entity301 aquarium industry that make millions of dollars using dolphins for extremely popular aquatic acrobatic shows			2
pictured yesterday , the dolphins are oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen			0
they are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for ' selection ' treatment : the fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear cramped : the cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim , forcing them to huddle up in groups the town 's fishermen defend the hunt as a cultural tradition , yet ' @entity196 ' was met by protests from right - wing activists when it was screened in @entity5 in 2010			1
the selection is process is likely to continue until tomorrow			0
no dolphins have been slaughtered so far			0
the @entity332 , which is in charge of the dolphin hunt , was not immediately available for comment .			0

250 dolphins are being held captive in a cove in the village of @entity22 , @entity5
25 of the animals were selected today for a life of captivity in aquariums
among these was rare albino dolphin , transferred to @entity106
another captive died while being transported to a harbour holding pen
remaining dolphins will meet their fate tomorrow - *possibly* death by spear
selection process was documented in the oscar winning film ' @entity196 '
blame could lie with @entity5 's *multi-million* dollar marine park industry
fishermen use brutal tactics to herd and capture the dolphins in the cove
the yearly killings mean the dolphin population is being *decimated*
