a testy exchange between @entity2 commissioner @entity1 and @entity4 rep. @entity3 broke out during a @entity6 hearing on friday , with @entity3 shouting at the @entity2 chief at one point , ' i do n't believe you ! this is incredible ! ' the explosive back and forth came after @entity1 testified that emails belonging to @entity13 and six other @entity2 officials were not necessarily ' lost ' forever and claims made otherwise by @entity6 chairman rep. @entity16 were ' inaccurate			1
' ' at this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives , ' he said			1
@entity1 told committee members that his agency is n't certain yet that it ca n't retrieve old emails from employees caught up in a scheme to target conservative organizations , which is why he did n't tell @entity28 that several hard drives containing copies of the emails had crashed until he was about them on monday			1
' this is not being forthcoming			0
this is being misleading again , ' @entity36 rep. @entity3 shouted @entity2 commissioner @entity1 during a @entity6 hearing today @entity2 ( @entity2 ) commissioner @entity1 said during testimony before the @entity6 today that it is still ' too early ' know if @entity13 and other @entity2 officials ' emails are irretrievable at issue throughout the committee hearing was whether the @entity2 purposefully kept the missing emails and crashed hard drives a secret for months			1
@entity1 did not inform the @entity6 until last friday about @entity13 's computer crash despite having knowledge of it since february			2
he did not tell the committee about the computer crashes affecting the emails of the other six @entity2 officials until the committee directly asked him for the information on monday , even though the @entity55 sent him a letter last spring encouraging him to tell @entity28 about the situation as soon as possible			1
' you say that you 've lost the emails , but what you 've lost is all credibility , ' @entity16 said during his opening remarks			0
during his testimony @entity1 said that in reviewing the emails his agency does still have on hand from @entity13 , the @entity2 found out that @entity2 tried to have the data from her damaged hard drive extracted - including her emails - before it was recycled and destroyed , but she was informed by employees on the @entity2 ' technical team that it was ' unrecoverable			2
' he also claimed it was n't shocking that multiple employees within an agency as large as the @entity2 had computer malfunctions			2
after @entity1 finished with his initial statement , @entity16 angrily told him , ' what i did n't hear was an apology			0
' ' i do n't think that an apology is owed , ' @entity1 fired back			0
' not a single email has been lost since the start of this investigation			0
' every email has been produced or will be produced , he said			0
the @entity2 chief blasted @entity88 for putting out a press release this week claiming that emails from the chief of staff for the former @entity2 commissioner @entity92 , @entity93 , had been lost after her computer crashed			1
if @entity88 had waited , @entity1 said , he would have found out that @entity93 had two computers - a work computer and a laptop			0
' so it turns out that none of her emails were lost , ' he said			0
' why should anyone believe you ? ' rep. @entity104 asked @entity1 during his allotted q and a period			1
' this is the most corrupt and deceitful @entity2 in the history , ' @entity104 said ' you say that you 've lost the emails , but what you 've lost is all credibility , ' @entity6 chairman @entity16 told @entity1 in his opening remarks after @entity1 had been badgered by a handful of @entity36 members of the committee , including @entity104 , rep. @entity117 , a @entity118 from @entity119 , apologized to the @entity2 head for his colleagues ' behavior , and @entity123 yielded his time for questioning to @entity1 so he could defend himself			1
' to say that this is the most @entity2 corrupt @entity2 in history ignores a lot of history , ' @entity1 said during his borrowed time			1
when the questioning by @entity36 resumed , rep. @entity3 exploded at @entity123 and @entity1			1
' this is unbelievable ! the apology that ought to be given is to the @entity135 taxpayer , not to a government agency that is abusing it 's power ! , ' he said			0
' nobody believes you ! ' @entity3 confronted the @entity2 head about not telling @entity28 about the six other crashed computers , to which @entity1 retorted , ' we told you on monday			1
' ' because we asked you , ' @entity3 fired back			0
@entity1 tried to explain himself , but @entity3 kept interrupting and shouting at him until another @entity146 rep. @entity145 butted in			2
' will you let him answer the question ? ' @entity145 asked @entity3			0
' i did n't ask him a a question ! ' @entity3 shouted at his colleague			2
' i am not yielding time , i control the time ! ' other members of @entity28 were hard on @entity1 during the hearing , but none as confrontational as @entity3			1
among @entity1 's defenders was the ranking @entity118 on the committee , rep. @entity145 , who posited that @entity13 's computer crash was n't a ' conspiracy ' by the @entity2 to cover up malfeasance			2
' there has not been any evidence of political motivation or @entity166 involvement ' in the targeting of conservative political groups , he said			0
' the prevailing conspiracy in this matter is that of the @entity36 â€™ desire to stir their base , tie the problem to the @entity166 and keep up this drum beat until the november election , ' @entity145 claimed .			0

@entity36 *representatives* on the @entity6 grilled @entity2 commissioner @entity1 during today 's hearing
the @entity2 chief testified that he did n't tell @entity28 about @entity2 officials ' missing emails and crashed computers sooner because he 's not yet certain the emails ca n't be recovered by other means
' at this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives , ' he said
' why should anyone believe you ? ' rep. @entity104 asked @entity1 during his allotted q and a period . ' this is the most corrupt and deceitful @entity2 in the history '
' i do n't believe you ! this is incredible ! ' rep. @entity3 shouted at him . *''* nobody believes you ! '
