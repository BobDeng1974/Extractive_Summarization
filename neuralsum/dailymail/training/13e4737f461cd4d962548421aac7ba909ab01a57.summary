by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 14 august 2013 @entity2 doctor dr @entity1 unlawfully killed a 70 - year - old man on his first @entity4 in the @entity5 patients are being put at risk because no fewer than 40 per cent of doctors taken on by the @entity9 every year are foreign , a top cancer surgeon has warned			1
dr @entity11 said far too many of them had poor language skills , knew nothing about our culture and had not received up - to - date training in their own country			1
out of around 13,000 new doctors registered by the @entity21 every year , just 7,000 come from @entity5 medical schools			1
meanwhile the @entity9 is becoming a ‘ bonanza ’ for doctors arriving in increasing numbers from @entity26 , @entity27 and eastern @entity28			0
dr @entity11 , a consultant surgeon at the @entity30 in @entity31 , also hit out at the poor quality of family doctors , saying the only reason @entity35 departments were at ‘ breaking point ’ was because many gps were ‘ not good enough ’			1
dr @entity11 has already exposed failings in the @entity9 in a series of trenchant articles for the @entity41			1
earlier this year he raised the alarm over the number of foreign patients being treated for free by the @entity9 , saying it was costing taxpayers millions of pounds a year			2
in an article for @entity48 this week , he called on health secretary @entity49 to scrap expensive @entity9 it schemes and spend the billions saved on ‘ training more @entity5 doctors ’			2
‘ this is an essential building block of a durable recovery , ’ he said			0
he went on : ‘ most readers will be surprised to learn that every year , we import 40 per cent of our doctors because of insufficient training places in @entity5 medical schools			1
‘ we encourage young people to become doctors , then we slap them back for want of places			0
‘ so 40 per cent of doctors starting work in the @entity9 every year have little or no knowledge and experience of @entity5 culture or of our health service – and this in the most people - centric occupation of all			2
’ dr @entity11 blamed the government for not wanting to pay for more expensive places – a failing which was opening the door to doctors from @entity28 and beyond			1
‘ from the foreign doc ’s perspective , working for the @entity9 is a bonanza , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity28 doctors fly in to cover locum vacancies , especially in general practice			0
there is no test of language proficiency before registering			0
‘ as a result of austerity in southern @entity28 , there has been a significant increase in @entity21 registrations of newly - qualified doctors from @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity94 , @entity95 and especially eastern @entity28			2
’ dr @entity11 also hit out at the poor quality of family doctors , saying the only reason @entity35 departments were at ' breaking point ' was because many gps were ' not good enough ' ( file picture ) he said the reliance on overseas doctors meant there were real risks to patient safety			1
‘ importing doctors from abroad might not be a bad thing if there were any guarantee the entry criteria to foreign medical schools were as rigorous as our own , ’ he said			1
‘ a @entity21 survey published in the @entity116 recently showed foreign - trained doctors were up to four times more likely to be suspended or struck off than their @entity5 colleagues			2
@entity120 of the system say there are filters in place to weed out dodgy doctors			0
‘ but where was the filter that checked the competence of dr @entity1 , a @entity129 - born @entity2 citizen who on his first gp locum in the @entity5 unlawfully killed a 70 - year - old man ? ’ dr @entity11 also used his article to hit out at @entity101 , saying they were so old - fashioned that patients had no option but to turn up at hard - pressed @entity35 departments			1
‘ modern medicine has been revolutionised by technology , little of which has filtered down into general practice , ’ he said			0
‘ gps can not carry out certain essential tests quickly			0
it is very easy for @entity101 to become “ de-skilled ” and by mid-career some may not be well enough informed to manage serious acute illnesses			0
‘ no wonder , then , that patients with acute problems prefer to go to @entity35 ; it ’s because gp services are n’t good enough : which is why @entity35 units are at breaking point			0

just over half of new doctors each year come from @entity5 medical schools
dr @entity11 said too many foreign doctors had poor language skills
he also said many had not received up - to - date training in their country
