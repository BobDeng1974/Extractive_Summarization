the missing plane @entity1 could have been ' cyber-hijacked ' using advanced electronic warfare technology , a new book co-written by a former lead @entity5 : @entity7 actor suggests			1
the controversial theory is one among several canvassed in the new 257 - page essay someone is hiding something , which also asks whether @entity11 could be responsible for its disappearance			1
the book was co-written by actor @entity14 - better known as detective @entity15 in the syndicated fictional crime drama - radio host @entity17 and author @entity18			1
it 's the latest in a series of publications and documentaries published since the plane went missing , with some aviation experts writing off the ' cyberhijacking ' theory as ' far fetched '			1
on the hunt : actor @entity14 is one of three authors of a new book examining various theories about the fate of missing flight @entity1 actor and author @entity14 ( pictured as detective @entity15 in @entity5 ) has turned his attention to the hunt for missing flight @entity1 no wreckage of the missing plane has been located by official search parties			1
the @entity39 vanished on march 8 2014 but @entity41 widow @entity40 , whose husband @entity42 was on board , said that while she has been ' bombarded ' with theories brought about by a slew of books , she has now become ' numb ' to them			1
' someone 's got to be right , ' she said			0
' i myself ca n't explain how such a sophisticated plane can just disappear			0
' the current phase of the @entity1 search will conclude in may , with the head of @entity56 saying he is hopeful the wreckage will hopefully be found in the next few months			0
the head of the @entity56 has said he is optimistic the plane will be found by may ' possible theories ' published in the book ' @entity63 ' the authors believe the idea the plane was downed by ' cyberjackers ' is among the more credible possibilities			1
' cyber hijacking is about the only possibility that fits the above circumstances insofar as the known evidence regarding the actions of the plane , ' the book said			1
' we ’re not saying that ’s what happened			0
the evidence , at this juncture , is inconclusive			0
' we are saying that the official version of “ we lost the plane and it may never be found ” is an obvious ruse and a very weak one at that			0
' what we keep hearing as the official explanation of this case has got more holes in it than @entity91 cheese — and a pretty “ holey ” batch of @entity91 cheese			0
' investigators searching for @entity1 say they could finish scouring the priority zone by may , more than a year after it vanished , if there are no delays ' landed at a @entity99 ' one of the most popular theories circulated online is that the flight was diverted to a @entity103 military base in the @entity104 , on the island of @entity106			1
it 's a theory that still ' can not be ruled out ' , the authors contend			2
' all in all , the evidence indicates that diverting @entity1 to @entity106 , by whatever means , for whatever reasons , can not be ruled out as a possibility			2
' and we ’re not saying that we know what those reasons are , or that that is definitively what happened to flight 370			2
' but we are saying that diversion to @entity106 can not currently be eliminated as a possibility , ' they write			0
the initial international search effort involved more than a dozen planes and at least nine ships ' @entity124 ' an ' accidental or intentional ' strike followed by ' surreptitious debris retrieval ' is highlighted as another theory by the authors			2
given the widespread debris that would such an attack would cause , the authors suggest that the enormous search afterwards was ' actually part of a larger plan to discreetly recover and destroy what little evidence of the aircraft remained after the strike '			0
search team : international search crews have been unable to locate the missing flight in the @entity104 ' alien contact ' co-author @entity17 , who runs a @entity103 radio show that examines ' unexplained phenomena ' , told the @entity144 on wednesday the possibility of alien intervention was ' fantastic , but possible '			1
in the book itself , the authors admit the eyebrow - raising possibility is rather unlikely , noting there is ' no evidence ' so far			1
but the truth is out there , they write			0
' so , how does the possibility of alien life relate to @entity1 , one might ask ? that ’s a damn good question			2
' it ’s just that it ’s something that a discernible percentage of the population actually believes in and - if it is true - it ’s an unknown that some apparently believe could possibly explain many otherwise unexplainable things , including the bizarre circumstances of flight 370			2
the @entity168 ( pictured ) , an @entity170 vessel , was involved in the initial search for the downed plane use of advanced technologies the book posits that an advanced kind of electronic warfare technology could be deployed to ' hide ' the missing plane			1
' today ’s electronic warfare ( @entity180 ) capability includes weaponry that can hide planes , ' the authors write in one passage			0
despite the lack of any evidence indicating sabotage , the book concludes the use of a ' cloaking technique ' ' remains possible '			0
someone is hiding something : what happened to @entity1 by @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity17 is published by @entity194 and on sale now .			0

new book co-written by @entity5 star suggests ' cyber-hijacking ' a *plausible* theory
the @entity202 flight has been missing for nearly a year after it vanished on march 8
*authorities* believe it most likely crashed into an arc of the @entity104 , west of @entity170
' fantastic , but possible , ' one of the authors told the @entity144 of the possibility of alien interference - to some *scepticism*
