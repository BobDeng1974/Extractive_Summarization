the saucy @entity12 teacher was fired late last week , according to the @entity28 , only days after her naughty past was made public			2
though she was not a @entity32 employee at the time the pictures were taken , administrators deemed her past inappropriate for a 21 - year - old teaching students only a few years younger			0
ms @entity2 has not waged a public battle with the school , instead focusing on the students , and they have returned the positivity in spades			1
a number of former students have tweeted her directly saying they want her back			0
' we all miss you so much & want u back bcuz we arent learning & these assignments are hard ! u were my fave teacher , no joke , ' one student tweeted ms @entity2			1
' i 'm sorry : ( if i could come back i would , ' ms @entity2 replied			1
' i miss y'all ! ' other students tweeted frowning pictures from classrooms and showed genuine affection for their fired teacher			0
ms @entity2 even told one student where to find the stickers she gave on tests and home work			1
save ms @entity2 : students organized a petition to bring back their @entity12 teacher over 300 signatures : ms @entity2 says a student told her he gathered 300 signatures on this petition to reinstate the @entity12 teacher the best ever : a mother emailed the fired teacher to support her , even offering to write a letter of recommendation another student sent her a picture of the petition signed by hundreds , and ms @entity2 tweeted a picture of an email from a parent			1
' you are the best @entity12 teacher she has ever had , ' the parent wrote			2
' if you need a letter of support you can count on me as a parent and my daughter is willing to support you as well			0
' a poll in a local report about the firing was overwhelmingly in the former @entity15 model 's favor - 88 per cent of the over 2,400 people who replied said she should not have been let go			2
' i miss the kids , so i 'm sad about that , but otherwise i 'm doing fine , ' she tweeted			0
after thanking someone for their support , she tweeted ' i 'm just hoping they find a new teacher soon so it does n't affect the students			0

@entity17 ( pictured left ) is now a @entity12 teacher in @entity14 , @entity110			1
when she was 18 , she posed as ' coed of the month ' for @entity15 staying positive : despite no longer being a teacher , ms @entity2 has remained positive and not hit out against the @entity32 - but she may have hired a lawyer though saying on @entity114 she 's unable to discuss her firing for now - perhaps a sign she 's retained a lawyer , according to the @entity28 - she posted a picture on the social media site of herself before going ' on - camera			1
she then tweeted a picture of herself on tv that she says her mother took			0
it is not clear if that on - camera appearance was a modeling audition or for another reason			0
ms @entity2 also tweeted that she signed a contract saying she ca n't do any media interviews until november 8			1
miss @entity2 's sexy shots are available for all to see online - including the teenage boys she currently teaches			2
among her pictures are full - frontal naked shots , photos of her wearing ' winter bunny gear ' and lingerie , a simulated lesbian sex scene and a ' @entity139 ' gallery			2
in a behind - the - scenes video clip from the photoshoot , when asked about her hobbies , the teenager says : ' hunting , shooting ... i shot me a buck last year			0
' model behavior : miss @entity2 relaxes and eats beef jerky in between modeling for @entity15 's ' coed of the month ' in 2011 she adds that she is majoring in @entity12 and ' going to be a @entity12 teacher '			1
one parent , who wished to remain anonymous , told the @entity153 that although her @entity15 past should not prevent miss @entity2 from being a teacher , it did affect the way she is viewed by some students			2
' are her male 16 - and 17 - year - old students looking at her without picturing her nude ? ' another added			0
' and for the female students , is this someone they can respect as an educator , someone that they can look up to ? ' the @entity14 school district would not comment on miss @entity2 's pictures , saying that it was a ' personnel matter '			2
she was not employed by the school district at the time the pictures were taken .			0
