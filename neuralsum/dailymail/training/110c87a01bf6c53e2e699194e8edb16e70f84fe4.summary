' mr @entity204 added : ' yes , it is awful what is happening in @entity9 and the loss of life , but we do have to remember , whenever we have had a ceasefire in the last few days , it has been a ceasefire that has been obeyed and observed by the @entity166 but it has not been observed by @entity175			1
' @entity175 continue the rocket attacks that are not aimed at military targets or political targets			0
