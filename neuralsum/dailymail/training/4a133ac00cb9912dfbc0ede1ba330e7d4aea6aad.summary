@entity0 and @entity1 are constantly struggling over territory , politics and economic dominance - but now it appears the two @entity6 giants could have found another topic to fight about			1
earlier this month a @entity1 man was officially declared the world 's oldest living person at 115 , but @entity0 is fielding an alternative candidate for the title			1
this week an official news agency repeated claims that a @entity0 woman is 127 years old , which would make her the record - holder by a large margin			1
contest : @entity20 , left , and @entity21 , right , both claim to be the world 's oldest living person @entity20 , a former postman who was born on april 19 , 1897 , was named the world 's oldest person by @entity26 after the death of @entity29 @entity28			1
he lives in @entity30 and has 14 grandchildren , 25 great - grandchildren and 13 great - great - grandchildren			0
mr @entity20 is the second oldest man ever whose age has been officially verified			2
however , just a few days ago the @entity36 agency reported on @entity21 , a woman who claims to have turned 127 in september			2
official : mr @entity20 was declared the world 's oldest by @entity26 earlier this month celebration : mr @entity20 is handed a bouquet of flowers by a nurse as he is declared the record holder ms @entity45 lives in @entity48 region 's @entity46 , an area famous for the longevity of its residents			1
her id card claims she was born in 1885 , but she does not have a birth certificate to prove this			0
she lives with her son , who she says she gave to when she was aged 61			0
celebration : ms @entity45 with her family on what she claimed was her 127th birthday in september if ms @entity45 is truly 127 , that would make her the oldest person ever to have lived , beating @entity63 @entity62 , who died in 1997 aged 122			0
it is unclear how aggressively @entity0 intends to pursue the centenarian 's record claim , but it has the potential to become another bone of contention between the country and its rival power			0
even if ms @entity45 does not manage to wrest the title from mr @entity20 , interest in her home county will doubtless continue as it draws thousands of visitors seeking to discover the secret behind the long lives of its 74 residents aged more than 100 .			0

@entity1 's @entity20 is officially world 's oldest living person at 115
but @entity0 claims @entity21 should hold record as she is aged 127
