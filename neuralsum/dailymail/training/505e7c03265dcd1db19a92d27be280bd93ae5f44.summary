' it got to the point where i had enough and i told her i was going to leave			0
i was sick of the constant rejection			0
for me to not want to see @entity37 every day shows how far i have been pushed			2
' the couple share their story in a new documentary on more 4 called @entity55 , which reveals that one in three women have sexual difficulties that rob them of ability to orgasm			1
it 's something sex therapist @entity63 is all too familiar with as she regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems at her clinic in @entity68			1
@entity5 talking to sex therapist @entity63 about her low sex drive she said : ' sex is almost seen like a luxury , so if something goes wrong it 's the last thing that gets fixed and people find it quite difficult to ask for help			1
' it 's almost like it 's not important enough			0
but from what i see , when sex goes wrong it 's devastating			0
it damages a woman 's confidence and sex esteem , which has a knock on effect on the rest of their life			0
' @entity63 agrees to help @entity5 and @entity23 ignite their sex life , and found some of their problems could be traced back to @entity5 's childhood and turbulent teenage years			1

she was raised as a @entity101 by her mother and taught that sex before marriage was wrong			0

" ' @entity63 agrees to help @entity5 , pictured , and @entity23 reignite their sex life , and found some of their problems could be traced back to @entity5 's childhood and turbulent teenage years she had a miscarriage but then fell pregnant another two times , suffering another miscarriage and having an abortion , before having son , @entity35 , at the age of 18			1
@entity63 said @entity5 's early experiences of sex did n't show her how fun it could be but that it always came with serious consequences			1
@entity5 then had another boyfriend who she said once forced himself upon her when she did n't feel like sex , and that left her emotionally damaged			1
she said : ' he kept persisting so in the end i just had sex with him to get him off me			0
after that i used sex as a means of control			0
i think might be why i have problems now			0
' but @entity5 was keen to learn how to drop her defences and issues from previous relationships in order to save her marriage			1
@entity63 advised the couple to be more affectionate with one another and regularly pay one another compliments			2
@entity5 admitted she would previously avoided any intimacy with her husband - even a cuddle - for fear it would make him think it would lead to sex @entity5 admitted she would previously avoided any intimacy with her husband - even a cuddle - for fear it would make him think it would lead to sex			1
