the past few days have been turbulent , to say the least , for @entity1 middleweight , @entity0			1
when his upcoming fight against @entity3 was scrapped from the @entity6 's @entity5 card on april 4 , after @entity7 developed a foot injury , @entity0 was on the hunt for a replacement opponent			1
' i heard from @entity3 directly that he was injured and out of the fight			0
' i spoke to @entity14 and he said there 's no - one on the roster who is free to fight you , so it might have to be a newcomer			0
but i did n't want to fight a newcomer who people knew nothing about			0
he had a few guys in mind but none of them could take the fight or would agree to it			0
@entity1 's @entity0 found the replacement he was looking for after his fight with @entity3 was scrapped @entity0 will be facing @entity34 - @entity33 fighter @entity32 in the @entity6 's maiden event in the @entity36 ' i said , ' why do n't you give me @entity32 and let me fight in the @entity36 ? ' ' then @entity14 called back and said he 'd made about 500 phone calls and that he could n't find anyone , so your wish is my command â€“ you 're fighting @entity32 in the @entity36			1
' i went from being very down , to being very happy , and now i have 10 weeks to prepare for the fight			0
' @entity0 is looking to bounce back from two frustrating back to back losses , both of which the middleweight feels he would have won , were it not for poor judging decisions			1
@entity32 , meanwhile , who recently fell short of the @entity6 's top 15 middleweight rankings , is a veteran of the sport and will present a dangerous challenge on the ground for @entity0			1
' obviously i have to pay a bit more attention to my wrestling now ' said @entity0			2
' @entity32 is a very , very good wrestler			2
there will be a bit more of a focus on , but i am going to implement my own game plan			0
' @entity32 ( front ) fought in @entity6 184 but was forced into submission by @entity65 fighter @entity64 ( rear ) @entity64 celebrates his win over @entity32 in their middleweight bout during the @entity6 184 event at @entity71 the bout will feature on the @entity6 @entity73 : @entity77 vs. @entity76 fight card , the @entity6 's first event ever to take place in the @entity36			1
' six years ago i was in @entity79			0
' i lived there for 7 months and i always wanted to go to the @entity36 , so i 'm super excited			2
i 'm going to go out there about 10 days before to get acclimatized			0
the funny thing is , @entity32 trains about 3 hours away from me in @entity83 so we will both be going all that way			2
we will probably leave on the same flight to get out there ! ' when it comes to trash talk , we can expect to witness none of that in the lead up to this bout			0
' i know @entity32 ' said @entity0			1
' he 's pound for pound the nicest guy in the world			0
but this will probably be @entity32 's last fight in the @entity6			1
he 's wanted to fight in the @entity36 for so long so it 's great that he 's able to do that , but i think this will be the last fight for him			2
' it 's a fantastic opportunity that the @entity6 has given me , to allow me to be the one to retire @entity32			1
' @entity32 was on the losing end against @entity64 , but he 'll be hoping for a comeback against @entity0 on may 16			1

the pair will meet at @entity107 : @entity77 on may 16
@entity1 middleweight @entity0 says he will ' retire @entity32 '
the *spectacle* marks the @entity6 's first ever event in the @entity36
