@entity0 , the former @entity1 official at the center of an investigation into the targeting of conservative groups , has spoke out for the first time since she invoked her legal right not to testify against herself at a congressional hearing more than a year ago			1
@entity0 sat down with @entity9 ahead of a profile it released on her this morning and revealed that she has received death threats since leaving the government agency and has been called hateful names , like ' dirty jew ' and told she 'll ' go down in history as the worst person ever in the @entity18			1
' another time someone told her she was ' going to be put away in the deepest , darkest dungeon , and they were going to lock me up and throw away the key			0
' one death threat was so bad that federal agents had to guard her home , @entity0 said			1
despite the fallout from her admission last may that the @entity1 had inappropriately scrutinized some groups with political affiliations more than others , @entity0 said she has no regrets about the way she handled herself throughout the controversy			1
' i did n’t do anything wrong , ' @entity0 told @entity9			1
' i ’m proud of my career and the job i did for this country			1
@entity0 recently spoke out about a controversy involving her department 's targeting of conservatives for the first time since the congressional hearing @entity0 had mostly faded into obscurity since refusing to give testimony to a @entity54 last year , claiming that she could self - incriminate herself , before her lengthy interview with @entity9			1
although her name has been in the news consistently over the last several months as the @entity1 revealed to congressional investigators that a computer crash caused the loss of a large chunk of @entity0 's emails from 2011 - 2013 , @entity0 herself has stayed out of the fray until now			1
in her interview @entity0 defended herself against accusations being made by conservatives , including claims that she purposefully ruined her hard drive to throw investigators off her trail			0
' how would i know two years ahead of time that it would be important for me to destroy emails , and if i did know that , why would n’t i have destroyed the other ones they keep releasing ? ' she asked			0
@entity0 told @entity9 she believes she 's receiving much of the blame for her department 's wrongdoing because she was the first @entity1 official to acknowledge it publicly			1
' i was the person who announced it , ' she said			0
' i assume the other part of it is because i declined to talk , and once i declined to talk , they could say anything they wanted , and they knew i could n’t say anything back			0
' former colleagues of @entity0 suggested to @entity9 that they agreed and argued that the former tax exempt chief was not the only @entity1 official who made missteps in the years leading up to the public controversy			1
and despite being a registered @entity96 , @entity0 told @entity9 that she 'd voted for candidates from both political parties and that generally , she 's ' not a political person			2
' a former boss of @entity0 's at the @entity101 , where @entity0 worked for 20 years before moving over to the @entity1 in 2001 , backed up @entity0 's self - assessment			1
but two former colleagues of @entity0 's from the @entity101 , both of whom are @entity106 , said she was a partisan to the core , as evidenced by her vocal support of stricter oversight of political donations , a stance generally held by progressives and strongly opposed by conservatives			2
' @entity0 ’ ideology is against money in politics , is ‘ anti-contribution ’ ; that ’s her bias , ' @entity114 , a former executive assistant to a @entity106 @entity101 commissioner told @entity9			0
' her ideology inhibited fair administration of the law			0
' former coworkers at the @entity1 also offered up mixed opinions of @entity0 , with some saying they ' really loved her big personality , ' as @entity9 put it , and others depicting her as someone who was overly passionate about her work and ' snapped to judgment quickly			1
' ' we did n’t always get along , ' @entity130 , the former chief of staff to the @entity1 commissioner in charge when the targeting scandal erupted , told the @entity54 during its investigation into @entity0			1
' we would have occasions when i would , you know , call her , and she could scream for a minute			0
' ' her fuse was short , and if you come to the @entity1 , you better be able to sit and listen and ask questions and absorb and rethink , and she had a hard time doing that , ' recalled @entity144 , who worked with @entity0 at the @entity1 at the beginning of her tenure there			1
@entity144 retired in 2006 , @entity9 noted , five years after @entity0 began working there and the same year that @entity0 took over the tax exempt division of the agency			2
@entity0 , center , and former @entity1 commissioner @entity152 , left , were forced out of the @entity1 as a result of the @entity154 targeting scandal			2
the two are pictured here at the @entity44 hearing , where @entity0 invoked her right not to self incriminate herself , with deputy treasury secretary @entity159 , right a former director of the same department @entity0 oversaw at the @entity1 suggested that her limited knowledge of tax policy may have led to her division 's inappropriate probing of groups it suspected of political activity			1
' when managers are not familiar with the laws they are enforcing , they make bad decisions , ' @entity168 , a former tax exempt division head , told @entity9			0
he also indicated that side projects @entity0 pursued that were meant to streamline processes at the agency may have been a ' major contributing factor ' to slow approval process of conservative groups ' applications for non exempt status after the @entity1 ' investigation into them concluded			2
emails of @entity0 's that were turned over to congressional committees investigating the matter show that the @entity1 agency sought to rectify the situation in early 2013 as a government investigation threatened to expose the department 's bad behavior			1
a group of emails released by a @entity196 subcommittee indicate that the @entity1 and @entity0 were worried about the findings of the @entity199 investigation and wanted to get their side of the story out before the government agency 's @entity202 released it 's own report			1
throughout the @entity202 's investigation @entity0 maintained that scrutiny of conservative groups was not politically motivated and was instead the result of department policy to more heavily screen organizations whose names included politically charged phrases like ' tea party ' and ' patriot			2
' she also argued that the @entity1 ' intense examinations of those groups did not often result in them being denied tax exempt status , proving that the @entity1 was no more discriminatory of right - leaning groups than it was other organizations when it came to handing out tax benefits			0
sensing that @entity199 intended to side with conservative groups who were crying foul , the @entity1 concocted a plan to acknowledge the targeting , explain that that it was the result of poor management of ' front - line staff ' in it 's @entity228 , @entity229 , branch and hope that the incident blew over quickly			0
the @entity1 first planned to have @entity0 apologize for providing lax oversight of the satellite office in a speech she was giving in late april but decided against it last - minute			2
she eventually commented on the situation at another public speaking engagement several weeks later			0
at that event , hosted by the @entity238 , @entity0 , who is herself a lawyer , staged a question about the affair so that she could deliver the agency 's mea culpa in a controlled environment			0
the admission set off a media firestorm , and within days @entity1 commissioner @entity248 was forced to resign			0
a week after that , @entity0 was put on indefinite leave			0
before the @entity1 could terminate her employment , she followed through with a previously planned retirement and left the tax agency for good with a full pension , which is valued at approximately $ 100,000 a year			0
much of that money now goes towards @entity0 's legal fees , which she says have already exceed $ 100,000			2
@entity0 told @entity9 that she 'd like to work in the tax or legal profession again but she 's been unable to find employment elsewhere and ca n't even get volunteer jobs at organizations outside of @entity45 in her line of work			2
as a result , @entity0 has taken up volunteering at a local arts non profit , though she would n't tell @entity9 which one - ' i feel like having my name attached does nothing but cause issues for people , ' she said - and spends her remaining free time gardening and walking her dogs			0
even though she 's had a difficult time recovering from the controversy both personally and financially , @entity0 says not going to let her detractors ' ruin my life			1
' ' regardless of whatever else happens , i know i did the best i could under the circumstances and am not sorry for anything i did , ' she said .			0

@entity0 spoke out for the first time since she invoked her legal right not to testify against herself at a congressional hearing more than a year ago
the former @entity1 official revealed that she has no regrets about the way she 's handled herself throughout the controversy
' i did n’t do anything wrong *...* i ’m proud of my career and the job i did for this country '
@entity0 said that one death threat she received was so bad that federal agents had to guard her home
