@entity1 judges will decide on friday whether they will order a maternity hospital to turn off the life support machine of a clinically dead woman who is almost 18 weeks pregnant			1
the woman 's parents and her partner , who is the father of the unborn child , all want the woman to be allowed to die			1
however , the eight amendment of the @entity12 guarantees the equal status of the right to life of unborn with that of the woman			1
as a result , the hospital has ignored the next - of - kin 's requests and has sought a ruling from the @entity24			2
the @entity24 heard today from lawyers representing the hospital that there was no chance that the foetus was viable and would be born alive			2
the court will hear from all five parties tomorrow morning and deliver their decision on friday			1
@entity24 president justice @entity34 said : ' time is of the essence			1
' three judges of the @entity24 will issue a ruling on friday , however it is possible that this decision could be appealed to the nation 's @entity58			1
the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , is in her 20s and is being kept in a hospital outside @entity27 , which also can not named			1
the woman 's father was told in november 29 that his daughter had died although the hospital was obliged to keep her on life support as there was a foetal heartbeat			1
in the past , @entity1 hospitals have kept pregnant women on life support even after brain death in order to attempt to save the life of the unborn child			1
in the most recent documented cases , in 2001 and 2003 , the foetus died in the womb after one or two weeks			2
in this case , the woman 's parents and her partner have filed lawsuits asking the @entity24 to order the hospital to switch off the life support machine			1
if ordered , the hospital may keep the woman on life support for a further 17 weeks			1
the mother , who is in her 20s has been declared clinically dead following a brain trauma			1
the court case has reopened @entity1 's fractious debate on abortion and the rights of the unborn judge @entity97 said : ‘ if we could have that evidence , it would enable the court to have sufficient information to be able to make a quick and timely decision			1
’ he said : ‘ time is of the essence			2
‘ the longer time passes , it might seem incorrectly to some to foreclose some options			2
that ’s the last thing the court wants			0
the court is treating this as a matter of some urgency			0
but at the same time , i am hoping the levels of representation will bring home to people that all four corners are to be consulted and their views are being taken into consideration			0
’ he added : ‘ this is a very sensitive case , and a source of great distress to the family			0
the court will take it very seriously			0
’ @entity130 senior counsel , for the woman ’s father , said an application for her to be taken into wardship , which was raised last monday , will be dealt with at a later date			0
he said that the main focus at trial today will be a full hearing of the father ’s wish for certain court orders and declarations concerning the future care of the pregnant woman			2
the court has not yet been told what those orders and declarations will be			0
mr @entity130 said he would be relying on affidavits , including one from the woman ’s father , and that he could be calling up to two members of her family to give witness evidence			0
he said he will be calling one or perhaps two medical witnesses			0
@entity155 said he would be representing the interests of the unborn			0
barrister @entity158 said he was representing the interests of the mother			0
@entity161 , for the @entity162 , said it was an urgent and delicate matter			0
he said the @entity162 had been ‘ scrambling ’ to assemble all the required witnesses and evidence for today ’s hearing , and to arrange two independent firms of solicitors to instruct counsel for the unborn child and its mother			2
mr @entity172 said the @entity162 hoped to be in a position to have medical reports from a consultant obstetrician , a consultant in intensive care medicine and a consultant neurologist			0
he said there would also be a report ‘ from the treating doctors on the ground ’ in the hospital where the woman , who can not be identified , is currently			2
and he said her full medical notes would be made available			0
the court also heard that the consultant neurosurgeon who treated the woman at a @entity27 hospital prior to her return to the hospital outside the capital , had provided his report and could give further evidence if necessary			1
judge @entity97 said he would hear the case , along with ms justice @entity197 and ms justice @entity198 .			0

the @entity24 in @entity27 heard the pregnant woman is clinically dead
her parents and partner want the woman 's life support switched off
the hospital is *refusing* to act until it receives guidance from the courts
@entity24 president @entity34 said ' time was of the essence '
eighth amendment of the @entity1 constitution gives equal rights to the unborn
the woman in her 20s , was declared clinically dead november 29
the foetus and the mother are being represented by opposing legal teams
the woman 's parents , the hospital and her partner are all represented
the court will hear from all five interested parties tomorrow morning
the three judges said they will issue their ruling on friday
