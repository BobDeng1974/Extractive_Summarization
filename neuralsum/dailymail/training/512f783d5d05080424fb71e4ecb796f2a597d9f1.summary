after the meetings , plans call for @entity0 to return to the @entity2 on aug. 19 to resume the vacation , which ends five days later on aug. 24			1
@entity8 spokesman @entity28 said @entity0 would meet with staff , but he declined to say who else would participate or what the meetings are about			2
' this is an opportunity for the president to do some in - person meetings here at the @entity8 , just for a day or two , before he returns to @entity2 , ' @entity28 said thursday			1
@entity28 sought to contain mounting speculation about the vacation , saying the meetings are n't related to ' an emerging situation			1
' later that day president @entity0 announced in a presidential address that the @entity40 had made air drops of food and water to some 40,000 @entity4 refugees trapped on a mountain			1
and on friday morning the @entity40 launched an air strike against @entity48 extremists threatening to eradicate them			1
' when we face a situation like we do on that mountain - with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale			0
and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre , then i believe the @entity40 can not turn a blind eye , ' @entity0 said thursday night			2
' we can act , carefully and responsibly , to prevent a potential act of genocide , ' he said			0
' that ’s what we ’re doing on that mountain			0
' president @entity0 appeared to be full steam ahead with his vacation on friday			1
@entity28 told reporters this afternoon he did not have an update on the president 's meeting schedule , however , he said he would n't be surprised if some were about @entity4			2
' but again the president had planned to return to the @entity8 before this announcement , ' he said , referring to this morning 's air strikes			1
president @entity0 , left , and his daughter @entity75 ride a bike during a vacation on @entity2 last august			1
@entity0 and his family will take another two week vacation there , starting tomorrow			1
the president will return to @entity9 for a few days part of the way through , however outside of @entity4 there are several other issues brewing that could require @entity0 's urgent attention , including fighting between @entity89 and @entity90 militants and @entity92 's buildup of troops along its border with @entity95			1
a temporary ceasefire between @entity89 and @entity90 ended this morning after @entity89 refused to adhere to the terror backed group 's demand that it end its seven - year blockade of @entity5			0
toward the close of the 72 - hour window @entity90 fired at least 10 rockets , ending the longest ceasefire since the fighting began a month ago			0
@entity89 retaliated with strikes of its own , hitting several ' terror sites ' in @entity5			0
meanwhile , @entity92 placed a one - year , ' full embargo ' on the bulk of food imports from the @entity110 on thursday , including beef , pork , fruit , produce , poultry , fish , cheese and milk , in response to enhanced sanctions on its country by the @entity40 and its allies over @entity92 - backed separatists ' occupation of eastern @entity95			0
prime minister @entity124 has also threatened to ban @entity126 and @entity40 airliners from making transit flights to the @entity128 through @entity92			0
even so , @entity0 has not cancelled his vacation			2
@entity0 rarely forgoes getaways or fundraising trips based on global or domestic crises			2
his advisers often appear to take pride in resisting calls from @entity136 for the president to return to @entity9 or from fellow @entity138 nervous about the appearance of @entity0 either vacationing or tending to what some may consider less urgent matters			1
' he travels with an array of communications equipment and national security advisers that will allow him to perform all of the functions that are required of @entity40 's commander in chief , ' @entity28 said			0
' that 's true of any trip that he takes , and it will be true of the trip that the president takes this week			0
' in 2009 , @entity0 remained on vacation in his native of @entity154 after a man aboard a @entity157 - bound flight tried to detonate a bomb on @entity159			2
@entity0 also continued on with @entity2 vacations in 2010 as rebels in @entity162 were on the verge of ousting their government , and last year when @entity166 's military overthrew the country 's first democratically elected leader			1
just last month , @entity0 resisted calls while on a fundraising trip in @entity171 to visit the @entity40 - @entity173 border to witness the surge of unaccompanied children arriving there			2
pressed about the appearance of ignoring a humanitarian crisis , @entity28 declared at the time : ' we 're not worried about those optics			0
' @entity0 has upended his travel plans on several occasions , however			2
he has canceled three trips to @entity128 , including one in 2013 because of the @entity40 government shutdown			0
his late - december departures to spend @entity159 in @entity154 frequently have been delayed because of late action on @entity188			0
in 2012 , he returned to @entity9 from a @entity190 vacation to deal with ' fiscal cliff ' negotiations			2
@entity0 's public appearances while on vacation typically are limited to stops at local merchants and dinner out with family and friends			1
but in another unusual twist this summer , the president plans to attend a @entity138 fundraiser on @entity2 on monday			0
the @entity75 stay in @entity203 , on the western part of the island , and have rented a seven - bedroom , nine - bath , 8,100 - square - foot house along the island 's @entity208 side , far off any main roads			0
the @entity211 reported earlier this month that the 17 room home sits on 10 acres of land and is worth upward of $ 12 million			0
the property also features a pool , hot tub , and a dual tennis - basketball court			0
@entity0 has vacationed on the quaint island every summer of his presidency except during the 2012 re-election campaign			0

@entity0 is scheduled to leave tomorrow and wo n't return to @entity9 until august 17
after two days of meetings in @entity9 , @entity0 will return to @entity2 to finish out his family vacation
