by @entity0 for most people , the threat of bottles , bones and stones gushing into their beds as they sleep is not exactly high			2
but for one community in @entity9 , it is something they have to deal with every night - along with the risk of being assaulted , raped or even murdered ... just for being gay			1
such is the life of one group of homeless @entity16 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) youths who live in a storm drain ( or ' gully ' ) in the country 's capital , @entity24 - as revealed in a short documentary made by @entity26			1
homophobia is rife in @entity9 , with 80 per cent of the population harbouring anti-gay sentiment the @entity34 , as they call themselves , have sought refuge in the drains after being forced out from shacks , derelict buildings , and sometimes by their own families			1
unwilling to hide their sexuality , the sense of community and relative safety the gully provides acts as a welcome sanctuary			2
for that reason , a hint of optimism pervades the lives of the @entity34 , who go by such colourful names as @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
they try to live as dignified a life as possible , given their filthy cockroach / mosquito - infested surroundings : clothes are laid out to dry on the side of the drain ; they shower with clean water that gushes from a hydrant ; and sleep on makeshift mattresses crafted from pallets and carpets			1
unwilling to hide their sexuality , the sense of community and relative safety the gully provides acts as a welcome sanctuary @entity94 , one of the @entity34 , whose transgendered friend @entity92 was murdered in 2013 a ' buggery ' law still exists in @entity9 , harking back to colonial times , whereby anyone caught having anal sex faces 10 years of hard labour in jail - although homosexuality itself is not illegal but at night , it can be cold , and there is the constant threat of someone jumping in to attack them			1

there still exists a ' buggery ' law , harking back to colonial times , whereby anyone caught having anal sex faces 10 years of hard labour in jail - although homosexuality itself is not illegal			0
the film - young and gay : @entity9 's @entity122 - explores how young transgender and homosexual people are leading the fight against the @entity128 island nation 's institutionalised homophobia through visibility , community spirit and an outspoken attitude towards their position in society			1
violent attacks against the @entity16 group are commonplace , with little to no retribution or justice brought against those responsible			0
evangelical preachers who promote homophobia attract huge and receptive audiences , while lyrics in popular songs regularly include exhortations to ' kill the batty boys '			0
the @entity147 do their best to scrape a living : selling biscuits , weed , alcohol and cigarettes , as well as engaging in sex work violent attacks against the @entity16 group are commonplace , with little to no retribution or justice brought against those responsible international advocacy groups often portray @entity9 as the most hostile country in the @entity158 for gays and transgendered people			1
between 2009 and 2012 , a total of 231 reports were made to @entity163 ( @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 )			0
@entity167 , @entity94 one of the @entity34 is @entity94 , whose friend @entity92 - a transgender teen - was murdered in july 2013			2
@entity92 was relentlessly teased in high school for being effeminate until he dropped out			0
his father not only kicked him out of the house at the age of 14 but also helped jeering neighbours push the youngster from the rough @entity9 slum where he grew up			1
by the age of 16 , the teenager was dead - beaten , stabbed , shot and run over by a car when he showed up at a street party dressed as a woman			0
his mistake : confiding to a friend that he was attending a ' straight ' party as a girl for the first time in his life			2
' when i saw @entity92 's body , i started shaking and crying , ' @entity94 told @entity190			2
she was one of three transgendered friends who shared a derelict house with the teenager in the hills above the north coast city of @entity196			0
like most transgenders and gays in @entity9 , @entity94 would n't give a full name out of fear			1
it was so , so painful to see him like that			0
' most incidents were related to assaults , physical attacks , and displacement from homes and communities			0
other incidents included extortion and threats as well as sexual violence , particularly against lesbians and bisexual women			0
homophobic attacks sometimes occur in broad daylight , with the footage then shared across social media			2
the run - up to the 2012 election provided a glimmer of hope for the gay community - when @entity9 's prime minister @entity226 aimed to review the buggery law , in a show of support for gay rights - but she has since failed to follow through on her proposals			1
in the documentary , one gully @entity167 resident told @entity26 reporter @entity234 : ' we 'll have drama in the gully every day			1
they even throw acid and chop [ people ] up			0
' however , @entity24 's police force has its own take on the crisis			1
@entity244 , commanding officer of the @entity245 , said there were problems with the ' diverse , sexual group ' in the gully who ' use the umbrella of the gay community to commit crimes ' including ' stealing phones ' from passers - by ' by threatening with knives or machetes '			1
for their part , the @entity147 do their best to scrape a living : selling biscuits , weed , alcohol and cigarettes , as well as sex work			0
one resident , @entity264 [ who sees himself as female ] , said that when people found out he was gay , he went to live in a squat , where he made many friends			2
then one night , someone came in and killed two of his companions by cutting their throats			0
during the documentary , @entity264 is seen celebrating his birthday			0
one of his friends , @entity277 , says , ' i wish she lives to see many , many more			0
' but as the @entity147 know only too well : a life can be worth little on the streets of @entity9 .			1

new vice news documentary reveals life led by gay and transgender youth in central @entity24
