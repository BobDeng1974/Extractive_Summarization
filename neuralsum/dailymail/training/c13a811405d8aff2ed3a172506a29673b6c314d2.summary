a man who had sex with a performing dolphin at an amusement park in the 1970s has claimed the encounter took place because the animal seduced him			1
@entity7 , 63 , claims that he fell for @entity8 , a bottlenose dolphin who lived at the now - defunct @entity12 theme park in @entity13 , after her amorous advances			1
@entity7 told the story of their year - long affair relationship again in @entity18 , a new film which premiered last week at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity20 , which takes place at the same time as the more famous @entity24 , is seen as its edgier alternative and hosts more niche films			0
' and as i was rubbing her and moving my hand towards her tail , @entity8 was slowly rolling around her long axis			1
' according to @entity48 , @entity7 went on to describe the sex in even more detail , while an ' animated interpretation ' of the encounter was played			1
in previous interviews about this encounter , which he also turned into a novel called @entity56 , @entity7 has claimed the relationship was consensual			1
the relationship reportedly lasted a year			2
last year he told @entity60 's @entity59 : ' there 's something quite transcendental about making love with a dolphin			0
' the dolphin is very aware , the dolphin is an intelligent and creative creature and making love is a consummate act			0
' he added that their courtship began when @entity8 ' announced her intentions to me by positioning herself so i was rubbing against her			1
' he then detailed how he was often left alone with @entity8 and the other dolphins , whom he was photographing at the time			1
this allowed him to sneak off with her after closing time to have sex			0
in another interview , @entity7 said : ' it 's like being with a tiger or a bear			2
this is an animal that could kill you in two seconds if it wanted to			0
' according to @entity7 's blog , the screening of the film was ' well - received ' by its initial audience , and nobody walked out			1
in a personal verdict on the film , he describes the sex animation as ' beautiful '			1
he also says it is ' oddly accurate , without being graphic or vulgar			0
' performer : @entity8 , pictured above during a show , lived at the @entity101 theme park in @entity13 defunct : the park no longer exists , but used to offer sealife shows , as well as steamboat trips such as the one shown above he also reveals that some animators turned down the project once they discovered the controversial content of the film			1
@entity7 's acts would be illegal today			2
but @entity31 only enacted a law banning bestiality in 2011 , so the encounter he described in 1971 would not be covered			1
filmmakers @entity114 and @entity116 have defended their film 's content , say that @entity7 's experience is ' unique ' and an ' appealing ' subject for a documentary			1
they told the @entity122 : ' however uncomfortable it can be as a subject matter , what @entity7 experienced is unique and very real and very serious to him			2
' he is a member of a community ( zoophiles ) who live on the outermost fringes of society			0
' their reality is something most of us can not comprehend , relate to or know much about - all of that makes it all the more appealing to me as a subject to tackle			2
' while @entity7 's experience is undoubtedly out of the ordinary , there are other recorded incidents of dolphins having sex with humans - or at least trying to			1
one well - documented case involves a female scientist who started having sex with a dolphin in the 1960s as part of a @entity150 experiment to try to teach the creatures to speak @entity152			0
@entity153 was stationed in a flooded house in the @entity156 @entity155 in 1963 , where she was tasked with trying to teach an adolescent dolphin called @entity159			0
' precious and gentle ' : @entity153 , who had sex with a dolphin called @entity159 , above , in 1963 , has also opened up about her relationship at first she let @entity159 relieve his urges with female dolphins kept nearby - but later claimed it helped the experiment to let him have sex with her , instead			2
in a @entity170 film about the relationship , she said : ' @entity159 liked to be ... with me			2
he would rub himself on my knee , my foot or my hand and i allowed that			0
' i was n't uncomfortable - as long as it was n't too rough ... it was just easier to incorporate that and let it happen , it was very precious and very gentle , @entity159 was right there , he knew that i was right there			0
' ' it was sexual on his part - it was not sexual on mine , sensuous perhaps ... i was there to get to know @entity159 , that was part of @entity159			2
' dolphins also often target their advances on humans who have no interest in reciprocating			0
several tourists at dolphin swimming events have been leaped on and mounted by aroused dolphins , often to the amusement of onlookers , whose videos of the events have gained significant attention			0
however , the dangers of an advance can in some situations be very real , given the strength and size of dolphins , who often weigh more than 400lbs			0
in 2002 , swimmers on the @entity211 were warned of a dolphin which tried to attack a series of female swimmers in the sea by encircling them and isolating them from their companions .			0
