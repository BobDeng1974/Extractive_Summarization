this @entity1 daredevil duo showed off some serious stunts earlier this month			2
thankfully , @entity3 , one of the country 's leading base jumpers , and @entity7 , an experienced slackliner , were filmed by an onlooker - and willing participant - called @entity10			1
after videographer @entity11 attempted the rope swing into a base jump trick , he decided to document @entity14 and @entity7 's impressive project			1
' i can without a doubt say that it was the scariest thing i have ever done			0
' i subsequently asked them if i could make a short movie of what they were doing for them and ' @entity34 ' is the result			2
' in the video , @entity3 explains just how much work goes into ensuring that a stunt of such stunning magnitude goes off without a hitch , before fastening the @entity42 camera to himself and plunging down toward the ocean below			1
once safely on the ground , @entity3 flashes a peace sign to the @entity42 camera an experienced rigger , @entity3 's fellow daredevil @entity7 also makes sure to take a turn on the swing rope no fear here ! @entity7 happily soars above the ocean , swinging back toward the cliffside ' we did some test jumps to make sure it can hold on and everyone 's held on , so it 's all good			1
but the problem is , if you do n't swing through the whole swing and let go at the bottom , you 've above about 70 m of vertical , which is too low to base jump			1
' you 'd make it , but it would be very nasty			0
if you hold on all the way to the end , you 're like 150 m [ above the ground ] , so that 's safe			0
as long as you do n't slip off , you 're good			0
' after @entity3 demonstrates his skill , swinging out over the ocean , before parachuting the rest of the way down the cliffside , his friend @entity7 takes on a breathtaking slackline walk			2
next up ? @entity7 , a trained stunt professional and slackliner , will take a walk high in the sky though he shakes at times , @entity7 keeps calm and cool and maintains balance while walking out over the ocean , @entity7 says that he keeps his eyes fixed on the horizon upon completing his tricky walk in the sky , @entity7 turns to his friends to proclaim : ' project done ! ' @entity7 , a master rigger , does mostly stunt - orientated work for the movie industry , and also has a company that specialises in manufacturing climbing and slacklining gear			2
' generally , on a high line , you would walk toward a cliff face or slackline towards a tree , ' @entity7 explains after completing his sky - high walk			0
' but this , your fixed point is the horizon			0
' although it took several days to set up and test the length and strength of the ropes and lines , both men told @entity10 that it was ' very unlikely that they would ever rig it back up again			1
' talk about a true once - in - a - lifetime experience !			0
