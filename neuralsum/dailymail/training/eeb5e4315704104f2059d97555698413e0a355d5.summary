@entity0 , who shared the 1964 @entity1 for revolutionary invention of the laser , has died at age 99			1
@entity0 , a native of @entity5 , recalled that the idea for how to create a pure beam of short - wavelength , high - frequency light first dawned on him as he sat on a @entity11 , park bench among blooming azaleas in the spring of 1951			1
the thought would later turn into a feat that forever changed science , medicine , telecommunications and entertainment			0
he later went on to receive the @entity1 in 1964 and the @entity23 for advancing life 's spiritual dimension in 2005 ( right ) the revelation led mr @entity0 and his students to build a device in 1954 they dubbed a maser , which stood for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation			1
four years later , he and a brother - in - law , @entity33 , conceived of a variation on that invention to amplify a beam of optical light , instead of microwave energy , and @entity39 patented the new idea as a laser			2
the scientist died early tuesday morning while heading to the hospital from his @entity46 home , the @entity42 reported			1
another scientist , @entity47 , was the first to demonstrate the first actual laser in 1960			2
lasers use synchronized wavelength of one color of light to create a focused beam in contrast to spread out normal light but four years later , @entity0 shared the @entity1 for his work with two @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , who independently came up with the idea for a maser			1
mr @entity0 went on to pioneer the use of masers and lasers in astronomy			1
with the help of colleagues he became the first to detect complex molecules in interstellar space and first measured the mass of the giant black hole at the center of our galaxy , the @entity75 , which he discovered in 1985			1
mr @entity0 spent nearly 50 years with the @entity42 , @entity42 's physics department an array of laser - based infrared telescopes he built at the @entity79 observatory outside @entity80 can measure the diameter of stars that appear as mere points of light in most telescopes			1
" he was one of the most important experimental physicists of the last century , " astrophysicist @entity87 , director of the @entity88 , said in a profile of @entity0 published by @entity42			2
a professor emeritus at @entity42 , mr @entity0 first came to the university in 1967 and spent time on campus as recently as last year			1
he attended @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , where he studied under renown physicists @entity99 and @entity100 , according to the @entity101			0
he worked @entity39 in @entity102 during @entity103 before joining the faculty at @entity22 , where he did much of his original work with lasers			2
mr @entity0 's invention turned out to have roles in a wide range of technical applications that have become ubiquitous fixtures of the modern world			1
incorporated into a broad variety of consumer electronics and optical fibers , lasers also are used to cut metal , perform surgery , trap atoms and trigger nuclear fusion reactions			0
throughout his prestigious work in science , mr @entity0 remained deeply spiritual			1
he wrote that instead of religion being separate from science , faith in an orderly universe is what allowed humanity to move ' age of superstition to an age of science '			0
in addition to his scientific honours , he won the @entity23 in 2005 for advancing knowledge in spiritual matters			0
previous winners include @entity136 and the @entity137			0
mr @entity0 is survived by his wife , four daughters , six grandchildren and two great - grandchildren			2
laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation			0
electrons enter an excited state after being exposed to energy often in the form of light flashes , which cause them to shift their positions within an atom and emit photons , or light particles			0
the emitted light particles are all the same wavelength ( meaning they are the same color ) and the crests and troughs of the different photon wavelengths all match up to each other			0
one photon from an excited atom then triggers more atoms to be excited and creates a larger number of photons , stimulating more emission of radiation			0
the atoms and their photons are often trapped inside a tube with two mirrors at the end , keeping the photons bouncing back and forth and making more photons of the same wavelength			0
a small hole in one side of the tube allows some photons to escape , releasing a concentrated beam of colored light .			0

@entity5 native died en route from home to hospital in @entity46
mr @entity0 first came up with idea for laser while sitting on @entity11 park bench
he shared the @entity1 in 1964 for his work on the laser
in 1985 he discovered the black hole at the center of our galaxy
