a new @entity1 jab is being given to people living in the @entity4 countries most badly hit by the virus after human trials in unaffected countries proved successful			1
scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after ' highly promising results ' in the first 138 healthy adults who were vaccinated with various doses			1
the vaccine , developed in @entity15 , is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus ( @entity18 ) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the ebola virus			1

the researchers , whose findings are published in the @entity37 , said one jab protects against a disease which has killed more than more than 10,460 people in a year across six countries including @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity28 , @entity44 , the @entity45 and @entity46			2
dr @entity47 , of the @entity48 at @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , said the @entity1 antigen is inserted into the vaccine as a trojan horse to get the body to develop an immune response against the virus			1
he said : ' an @entity1 glycoprotein from the @entity1 strain in @entity60 is being inserted into the @entity18 live vaccine			2
while @entity18 only causes mild symptoms in humans , the protein acts as an @entity1 antigen and triggers the formation of antibodies against the disease in the immune system			1
' dr @entity47 said these antibodies hide , almost like a ' @entity54 ' , in the body in order to successfully fight the ebola virus if the individual becomes infected			1
scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after ' highly promising results ' he added : ' just one vaccine has conferred one hundred per cent protection against @entity1 in the initial trials on primates			1
' dr @entity47 said the first phase i clinical trial is now complete			0
he said : ' the vaccine response is very reliable , the vaccine itself is safe and its tolerability is acceptable			0
' the most significant side effect was found to be temporary joint pain and inflammation reported among a small group of test subjects , particularly in the @entity95 centres			0
in the @entity98 studies that are now beginning , the vaccine will be used in patients living in the areas currently most badly affected by @entity1 , especially @entity43 and @entity28 , but also in @entity42			2
the first case of @entity1 was reported in @entity4 around 15 months ago			0
according to estimates , around 25,000 people have been infected by the virus - and more than 10,000 of them having died since as a result			0
the race is on to find ways to prevent and cure the ebola virus as there are no proven treatments or vaccines to prevent individuals becoming infected			2
but progress is now being made on an unprecedented scale with trials which would normally take years and decades being fast tracked on a timescale of weeks and months			0
the aim is to use the lowest dose of vaccine possible that provides protection			0
vaccines train the immune systems of healthy people to fight off any future infection			0

vaccine based on animal virus and the protein covering of ebola virus
ebola antigen in vaccine acts as ' @entity54 ' to *create* immune response
