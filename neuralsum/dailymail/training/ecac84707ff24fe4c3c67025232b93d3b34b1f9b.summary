against the odds , @entity0 are flying high in the @entity2 and shocked @entity3 in the @entity4			1
@entity6 's side were written off after a less - than - ideal summer , so what has got the @entity0 marching on this season ? @entity10 looks at five reasons			1
@entity0 have won five in a row , including a 2 - 1 win against @entity3 in the @entity4 humility not a trait obviously associated with superstar @entity17 footballers and @entity6 is n't meek			1
however , he has learned his trade along the way			2
he had looked like another star name jobbing his way around @entity23 on the basis of his playing reputation			2
his stints at @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 endly badly			0
but at @entity31 he took a struggling club with limited resources and restored them to their place in @entity36 's top three			0
even during his troubled spells there were indications of talent : an impressive @entity41 win with @entity28 and a @entity43 quarter final with @entity29			0
along the way , unlike many footballing celebrities , he seemed to have continued learning and improved			0
@entity6 was a fine player , but he 's learnt the ropes as a manager and is now experienced tactical continuity at first glance there does n't seem that much in common between @entity6 and @entity52			1
the clue is in @entity54 , however			0
koeman of course was schooled in the @entity58 school at @entity27 and @entity59 at the same time as @entity52 was coming under the influence of @entity54 in @entity61			0
and @entity54 and @entity58 are the two most important mentors to @entity63			0
on separate continents in @entity36 and @entity61 , a common style was emerging of rampaging full backs , splitting centre halves and intense pressing			0
@entity6 and @entity52 come from same broad tradition , even if their mentors developed far apart			1
@entity71 ( above ) and @entity6 share the same link to management as @entity63 ( below ) good signings with close on Â£ 100million incoming over the summer , it must have been tempting for club and newly - installed manager to go a little crazy			1
instead they have made what look like steady and sensible signings , using their new - found financial muscle responsibly			2
@entity6 knows all about @entity83 , having managed him at @entity31 ; in @entity84 , he simply went for the best young emerging star in @entity86 , who was destined for one of the @entity17 big three , and took him straight to @entity2 ; @entity88 was an obvious and solid addition ; @entity90 likewise ; @entity91 and @entity92 have added depth to the squad and seemingly quality as well			1
@entity83 scored plenty of goals for @entity31 under @entity6 and is continuing that in the @entity2 @entity0 bought the finest young talent in the @entity86 in @entity84 the world - renowned academy they have n't quite come up with @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 on the south coast			1
but @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 is n't a bad list of alumini			0
the club is repaing the benefits of ten years of the right kind of work			0
not only financially are the club secure ( see above ) but @entity6 still has the likes of @entity120 at his disposal , as well as fellow englishmen @entity122 and @entity124			1
@entity125 may have left , but the @entity0 still have players coming through their ranks and a little dose of good luck ...			1
@entity130 aside and nowithstanding that superb win at @entity3 last night in the @entity4 , @entity6 has had a gentle introduction to the @entity2			1
the run of winnable fixtures continues , though there is a delicious clash with @entity52 's @entity138 forthcoming			0
the comeuppance is from november 30th to december 28th , with a run of games against @entity142 , @entity3 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			2
still , nothing like momentum to get help settle you in			0
and given the respective form of some of those teams and @entity0 , who 's to say they should fear them ? @entity0 have had a relatively easy start ... so , will it last ?			2
