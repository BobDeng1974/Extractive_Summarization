' there was a boy on a push bike going in the same direction , ' he said			2
' he was about three metres away from me talking on the phone but i did n’t really hear what he was saying			2
' mr @entity28 continued : ' i heard a loud bang - it came from the flat i was walking past			2
' the bang came from the block			2
i did n’t know what it was at first - my first reaction was to look away to the right			2
' i looked back to the left and the boy on the phone spoke to me			2
he started to cry and said , " did you see that ? " he was kind of shocked			0
' he added : ' i saw the girl on the floor and the body was n’t moving			0
the boy on the bike was too much in shock			2

' if you accept there are incidents where the boys are the aggressors , you have to consider the occasions when @entity1 is the aggressor , ' he said			1
‘ i know there ’s more than one of the boys and i know she is female , but i have to consider if there are occasions where her actions towards them can be considered in the same way			0
