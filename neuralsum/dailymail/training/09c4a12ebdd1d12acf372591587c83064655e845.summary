by @entity1 reporter published : 17:32 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 07:42 est , 3 january 2014 a fisherman has described his terrifying ordeal lost at sea after falling off his lobster trawler and into the @entity7 - 40 miles from shore			1
@entity9 , 45 , had been alone on the deck of his boat the @entity12 , with his partner asleep below , when a hook on to which he was holding snapped and propelled him off the end of the open boat into the chilly waters off @entity19			1
he yelled for help but the boat , on autopilot , was quickly out of sight , its disappearing lights a sign of how desperate a situation he was in			1
@entity9 describes how he spent 12 hours clinging to his rubber boats to keep him afloat after he fell off his lobster trawler into the @entity7 , 40 miles from @entity29 , @entity19 mr @entity9 shared his remarkable tale of survival with the @entity32			1
he runs a successful lobster and crab business with school friend mr @entity35 after moving to @entity29 to take up fishing and buying the vessel the @entity12 in 2006			1
the business partners were on one of the twice - weekly , 18 - hour overnight trips when near tragedy occurred at 3.30am on july 24 , 2013			2
once in the water , mr @entity9 managed to stay afloat by taking off his bulky green rubber fishing boots , trapping air in each one and lodging them under his armpits while he kept treading water			1
the weather was clear and the water , although not warm , the seasoned fisherman was able to stand			2
as dawn approached , he made plans to attach himself to something larger in the water so that he would be more visible to rescue teams			2
it was then he saw two shark fins circling			2
he grabbed his knife from his pocket and waited for them to approach but thankfully , they swam away			2
lobsterman @entity9 lies on a stretcher at @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 after being rescued by a @entity65 helicopter lucky : @entity9 , 45 , fell off his lobster boat into the @entity7 off @entity19 last summer and was rescued off the coast of the @entity69 island mr @entity9 set out on his boat the @entity12 from @entity29 harbor in @entity19 , @entity69 last july only for disaster to strike several hours later , mr @entity9 's partner @entity35 awoke and quickly realized with horror that his friend had become lost at sea at some point in the nine hours he had been below deck			1
the @entity12 was at this point now 60 miles off shore			2
he immediately alerted the coastguard in @entity80 and a desperate search began			0
soon a mission was in full swing - two coast guard boats were sent from @entity29 , two helicopters and a plane left @entity86 while a cutter from @entity69 redirected itself to the east			0
the coastguard issued instructions that a man had gone overboard between five and 60 miles off shore - a vast search area the size of @entity94 , almost impossible to cover by a search team alone			0
at best estimates , experts worked out that mr @entity9 could survive 19 hours in the water			1
the lost fisherman had one thing in his favor - a new search - and - rescue computer program put in place in 2007 - which analyzed wind and ocean currents to work out at what points he would most likely be			0
however despite the reliability of the machinery , there was one fatal flaw			0
search and rescue teams believed that mr @entity9 likely fell overboard at 10.30pm - when in fact he fell into the water five hours later			1
the initial search and rescue mission was massively skewed			0
@entity9 fell overboard off the coast of @entity19 , @entity69			1
the @entity117 coast guard team launched a massive collaborative search to locate @entity9 the fisherman is helped off a search and rescue helicopter after his ordeal lost at sea last july however one coast guard @entity123 was having second thoughts about relying so heavily on technology			1
he spoke to the distraught captain @entity35 to learn more			0
@entity35 revealed that his partner had been preparing the boat to receive the day 's catch , meaning the boat would have been further from shore			2
a new set of data was entered and the search for the lost seamen altered to coordinates further south			0
after mr @entity9 's parents were informed of his disappearance and as the news spread among the fishing community of @entity29 , 21 commercial boats joined the search for the missing man			1
while the search mission intensified , mr @entity9 floated alone on the sea			1
his legs were cramping as he searched for a buoy to hang on to , the sun blinded him and he was suffering from exhaustion and thirst			0
after several hours of searching , he found a small buoy to hang on to but his physical state was deteriorating after nine hours in the water			0
the veteran fisherman was shaking and sea lice had attached themselves to his thin clothes			0
he could see the planes overhead but they were too far east , so using the last of his strength he began to swim			0
once again he saw his boat the @entity12 ahead of him - but it was just out of reach			2
fortunately , he soon reached another buoy			0
he clung to the rope attached to it and stuck his rubber boots under his arms to keep him afloat			0
meanwhile , the rescue crews found false alarm after false alarm			0
they knew that the chances of rescue were slim - each time someone fell into the @entity7 , the likelihood was that they drowned			1
finally as one of the helicopters began its last search mission of the day on its final liters of fuel , there he was - @entity9 floating in the water below them , clinging to his rubber boots			1
mr @entity9 was flown to hospital in @entity61 suffering from hypothermia , dehydration and exposure			1
however he has suffered no lasting ill - health or post-traumatic stress from the incident			0
he has returned to work and with it , to the sea .			0
