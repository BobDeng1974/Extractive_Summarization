by @entity0 @entity2 's camp have apologised for cancelling saturday 's heavyweight clash with @entity4			1
@entity2 , who was originally scheduled for a bout with @entity6 before his fellow @entity7 was forced to withdraw through injury , pulled out of the fight with @entity4 on saturday morning after his uncle @entity10 was taken to hospital			1
and @entity2 's other uncle and trainer @entity12 has clarified the reasons behind the boxer 's decision to withdraw from the fight			1
my elder brother had gone for a routine operation to place a pin in his leg below the knee			0
' the operation was a success as fully expected , however a blood clot developed due to having a cast on his leg and sadly it travelled through to his arteries making the situation far worse			0
' since the operation , @entity10 has been in the intesive care unit at @entity55 where we are all by his side awaiting news			2
he is in critical , but stable condition at present and we are very worried			0
' @entity10 trained @entity2 for both his fights with @entity61 and @entity6 in the past and this situation has really affected @entity2 and the whole family as we are praying for a positive outcome			1
' we would like to thank everyone for all the nice messages of support and prayers for our family as they have been deeply moving and much appreciate			0
we are sorry to all the fans that we had to cancel the fights due to what is a terrible situation for all involved			0
no go : @entity2 ( left ) and @entity4 's fight is off after @entity2 's uncle was taken ill ' as everybody knows , we are a very close family and nothing , absolutely nothing , comes before our brother and @entity2 's uncle 's well - being			1
we would also like to give special thanks to the doctors and staff at @entity88 for their dedication in the work they do - especially in the @entity93 unit			0
' in a statement released by @entity95 , @entity10 was said to be ' seriously ill ' and @entity2 's camp therefore took the decision to ' pull him out of the fight rather than risk his health by sending him into the right with his mind not focused			1
' it is not clear what @entity10 's condition is			2
@entity2 had only decided to take on @entity4 earlier this week after original opponent @entity6 withdrew from saturday 's date after fracturing his hand in sparring			1
ironically @entity6 's injury came when he was sparring @entity4			1
@entity109 said : ' i 'm very , very , disappointed for the fans			0
after @entity6 pulled out because of his hand injury , we worked very hard to secure a world ranked opponent in @entity4			2
' it 's sad that his uncle @entity10 is in a serious condition and our thoughts are with him			2
we will be announcing the rescheduled date for @entity121 next week			0
