by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:00 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 6 september 2012 @entity2 was accused of presiding over a damaging ' fudge - a-rama ' on @entity4 last night – as it emerged that an independent review of airport capacity will not report back for three years			1
the prime minister told @entity9 that he would be announcing an independent commission in the coming days in a bid to settle the vexed question on where new airport capacity in the @entity14 should be put			0
former @entity16 boss sir @entity15 will lead the review , which ministers hope will win cross-party backing			0
@entity32 groups also drew attention to his time as a special adviser to former @entity37 chancellor @entity36 , who is now one of the country 's leading climate change sceptics			0
sir @entity15 , who oversaw the creation of the @entity41 , hit the headlines last year when he was forced to quit as director of the @entity44 following revelations about its links to @entity49 dictator @entity48			0
@entity22 and @entity2 are good friends - but they have a funny way of showing it			1
the mayor of @entity54 has regularly launched attacks and poked fun at the prime minister			1
mr @entity22 was elected for a second term in charge of the capital in may , but used a speech to supporters to admit they did it despite the prime minister			2
mocking him @entity22 said : ' we survived the rain , the @entity67 , the @entity68 - and the endorsement of @entity2			1
' four years earlier , @entity22 turned on mr @entity2 over his claims that @entity72 society was ' broken '			1
he said that the now prime minister 's claims were ' piffle ' adding that the success of @entity72 olympians in @entity78 proves youngsters are far from ' aimless , feckless and hopeless , addicted to their playstations '			0
but it was just last month that the mayor launched an extraordinary attack on @entity2 yesterday , warning him to stop ‘ pussyfooting around ’ on the economy			2
he urged mr @entity2 to be more ‘ ambitious ’ by cutting taxes , cutting regulation and investing in infrastructure such as a new airport in the @entity14			1
and now today he has tried to embarrass the prime minister over @entity4			2
but his report will not be published until the summer of 2015 , after the next election			0
the decision will cause dismay in the business community which argues that an urgent decision is needed to keep @entity72 competitive			0
@entity54 mayor @entity22 launched a furious attack on the government 's stance , saying it was ' madness ' to even consider expanding @entity4			1
mr @entity22 , who is promoting his own scheme for a new runway on an island in the @entity103 , said the decision to hold a three - year review would damage business			1
he said : ' it 's just a fudge , it 's just a fudge - a-rama and it 's just an excuse for a delay – there 's almost three years to run until 2015			2
' if such a commission were not to report until after the next election we 'd have lost a huge amount of time			0
i do n't think @entity72 business would be remotely satisfied with that answer			0
' what i worry about is that we are now seeing a stealthy u-turn being carried out which i do n't think is in the interests of @entity54 or indeed of the country as a whole			2
' asked if he would lead a campaign against expansion at @entity4 he replied : ' you bet i will , yes			2
' mr @entity22 acknowledged that @entity127 was ' very cross ' about his intervention and refused to rule out seeking a return to the @entity130 at a by - election to fight any attempt to expand @entity4			1
prominent @entity37 @entity133 , a former adviser on the environment to mr @entity2 , said he feared a u-turn on @entity4 was underway			1
he said this week 's removal of transport secretary @entity137 , who was firmly opposed to @entity4 expansion , showed that ' the government is at least trying to open the door to the possibility of a third runway '			1
new transport secretary @entity143 is said to have an ' open mind ' on @entity4 , although his new deputy @entity146 has in the past described the idea of a third runway as ' environmental vandalism '			1
in the @entity130 , mr @entity2 insisted that @entity139 policy had not changed			1
he said : ' while i believe we need to establish a form of review that will bring parties together and make a decision about airport capacity , i will not be breaking my manifesto pledge			1
' @entity159 said he remained ' sceptical ' about the case for a third runway at @entity72 's only international hub airport			2
@entity163 insisted a third runway ' will not happen ' under the @entity165			0
' my party 's manifesto is against a third runway and the @entity169 could not have been clearer – we have ruled out giving the go - ahead to a runway during this @entity173			2
it will not happen during this @entity173 , ' he said			0
@entity37 backbencher @entity176 , who last week called on mr @entity2 to show whether he is ' a man or a mouse ' on airport capacity , said : ' we need more runway capacity in the @entity14 in the 2020s – not in the 2030s			1
' shoved out : a sombre @entity137 ( right ) leaves @entity127 just after @entity2 told her she is no longer @entity143			1
@entity22 ( left ) accused ministers of being bent on a ' simply mad ' plan expansion : debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at @entity4 and the reshuffle intensified speculation there could be a u-turn on the issue anger : @entity37 @entity133 says he would stand down over the issue as he believes his party must protect those under the @entity4 flight path mr @entity22 , said miss @entity137 had been a ' first - rate @entity143 '			1
prime minister - @entity2 deputy prime minister - @entity163 foreign - @entity200 chancellor - @entity201 chief secretary to the treasury - @entity202 justice - @entity204 home secretary - @entity205 defence - @entity206 business , innovation and skills - @entity210 work and @entity212 - @entity211 @entity214 - @entity213 health - @entity216 education - @entity217 @entity218 - @entity219 transport - @entity220 @entity221 - @entity222 international development - @entity137 culture secretary - @entity224 @entity225 - @entity226 @entity228 - @entity227 @entity230 - @entity229 minister without portfolio - @entity231 minister without portfolio - @entity233 @entity236 - lord @entity235 @entity238 - @entity237 cabinet minister - @entity239 solicitor general – @entity241 chief whip - @entity242 ' there can be only one reason to move her – and that is to expand @entity4 airport , ' he said			1
' it is simply mad to build a new runway in the middle of @entity54			1
' nearly a third of the victims of aircraft noise in the whole of @entity255 live in the vicinity of @entity4			2
' now it is clear that the government wants to ditch its promises and send yet more planes over central @entity54			2
' the third runway would mean more traffic , more noise , more pollution – and a serious reduction in the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people			0
we will fight this all the way			0
' he told @entity275 's @entity274 programme : ' there 's lots of stuff been coming out of @entity279 to suggest that a u-turn is in progress and they want to build a third runway at @entity4 - all the pressure from businesses to do the third runway , that 's where the @entity285 seems to be focusing its hopes			1
' i think that is a profound mistake			0
it is not deliverable , it would do massive environmental damage , not just in @entity54 but for residents accross the city			2
there are much , much better solutions that will deliver long - term growth and jobs			0
' prominent @entity37 mp @entity133 told the today programme : ' i think it ’s impossible to pretend that this is n’t a sign , because we have n’t just lost @entity137 from this @entity304 , we ’ve also seen @entity226 moved out – both of whom were absolutely rock solid on this issue in terms of defending what is still the government ’s line officially			0
' the @entity37 made an unambiguous promise before the election , as did the @entity312 – it could not have been clearer ; the @entity169 immediately after the election could not have been clearer			0
' he again reiterated his threat to trigger a by - election if the government did perform a u-turn			0
' i promised people before the election that if the government performed a u-turn , i would trigger an immediate by - election and that people in this constituency would have a chance to have their say			0
absolutely [ i stand by that ] , ' he said			0
ministers have come under intense pressure from business to approve a third runway at @entity4 , @entity72 's only international hub airport			1
some @entity333 are also calling for a u-turn , with former minister @entity176 saying the issue was a test of whether the prime minister is a ' man or a mouse '			0
no 10 denied that @entity340 's removal signalled a shift in aviation policy			0
the prime minister 's official spokesman said a planned review of airport capacity would still go ahead			0
farewell but not goodbye : @entity231 was moved aside as justice secretary but will be staying in the cabinet supporters of expansion at @entity4 will be invited to make their case , but the spokesman said the @entity165 agreement , which rules out a third runway before 2015 , still stood			1
but @entity355 , executive director of @entity356 , said @entity357 had been ' shunted out of her transport job because of her opposition to a third runway at @entity4 ' adding that more airports or runways in the @entity14 ' would have a devastating impact on local communities and the environment '			1
on @entity366 , mr @entity143 will face opposition from @entity37 voters who live close to the proposed route			2
he will also be under pressure to limit next january 's planned 6.2 per cent rise in rail fares			0
vision : the ' @entity374 ' @entity103 airport , pictured , would be capable of handling 150 million passengers a year if built plan : the airport would be on the @entity379 in @entity380 and would have high - speed rail connections across @entity72 and @entity255 taking pressure of @entity4 video : @entity2 answers the question at @entity385 ... does he deny it ? ... video : deputy pm @entity163 rules out a third runway as long as the coalition is in ...			1

the mayor of @entity54 has admitted he fears ' a u-turn is in progress and they want to build a third runway at @entity4 '
' it 's just a *fudgearama* , ' he said
at @entity385 mr @entity2 said he would not break his manifesto pledge but did not rule it out after 2015
@entity137 dumped in reshuffle after *threatening* to quit over plan
mayor of @entity54 turns on @entity405 and says : ' there can be only one reason '
@entity143 takes over the transport brief after the reshuffle
@entity22 adds @entity139 ' should rule it out now and in the future '
