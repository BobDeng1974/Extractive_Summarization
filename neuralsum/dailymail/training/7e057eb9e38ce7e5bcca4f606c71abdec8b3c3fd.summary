on the same day secretary of state @entity2 held up a new @entity4 climate change report as evidence of global warming , a record - breaking storm hit his home state of @entity8 , which he was visiting that day for a funeral and a football game			1
the local temperature fell to 36 degrees that morning and snow and wind blasted the state			1
' the bottom line is that our planet is warming due to human actions , the damage is already visible , and the challenge requires ambitious , decisive and immediate action , ' @entity2 said in a statement on sunday responding to the release of an @entity25 review			1
a casually clad @entity2 , right , enters the stadium of the @entity27 with team owner @entity28 , left , before sunday 's game between the @entity27 and the @entity30			1
@entity2 sat with @entity31 in his indoor box while regular @entity34 fans suffered through 20 degree weather in order to see their team play as the statement was released , temperatures were dropping in @entity40 and snow began to blanket the north east , leading to the most snow fall on record for nov. 2 in the @entity8 in 120 years			1
later in the day the snow dissipated and just rain and sleet came down throughout the afternoon , the @entity46 reports			1
still , enough snow fell that the field of the @entity27 had to be cleaned off ahead of their early evening football game , which @entity2 attended with @entity27 owner @entity28 and watched from a cozy seat in @entity31 's indoor box , as @entity56 pointed out			1
outdoors , average @entity27 fans braved the 40 degree weather and 13 mile an hour winds that made the temperature feel like a chilly 32 degrees @entity62 to see their team play			1
temperatures crept back up into the low 50s today today , @entity65 data shows			1
the @entity4 's latest climate change report follows claims by @entity65 founder @entity69 that man - made global warming is not real			1
in an open letter last week to the @entity25 , @entity69 said , ' i have studied this topic seriously for years			2
it has become a political and environment agenda item , but the science is not valid			0
' warming has not occurred for a decade and a half , @entity69 said			0
' there is no significant man - made global warming at this time , there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future			2
' the @entity65 immediately disavowed @entity69 and trumpeted its own views that ' strong evidence ' points to an increase in temperatures globally as the result of human activity			2
' the science is really clear , and i do n't like our brand being associated with something that 's not scientifically based , ' @entity65 ceo @entity93 told @entity99			2
besides , @entity93 said , @entity69 has n't been affiliated with the organization he founded for thirty years			2
secretary of state @entity2 was in his home state on sunday to attend the funeral of former @entity105 mayor @entity104			1
a record - breaking snow storm hit @entity8 that day just as @entity2 released a statement sounding the alarm on global warming on sunday @entity69 assailed @entity93 on @entity99 and pointed out that unlike the current ceo of his former company he is a scientist who bases his arguments on fact			1
he also pooh poohed @entity115 host @entity114 , whose show he appeared on , for labeling him a climate ' denier ' when he is merely a ' skeptic			0
' ' @entity99 has taken a very strong position on global warming , ' he said , and claims ' that it is a consensus			0
' ' well there is no consensus in science			0
science is n’t a vote			0
science is about facts , ' he told @entity114			0
@entity69 lamented the fact that climate change had become politicized and a major part of the @entity134 's platform			2
' but he science is on my side , ' he said , triumphantly			0
he later told @entity99 viewers , ‘ hello , everybody ! there is no global warming ! ' democrat @entity2 said on sunday that not only is the climate warming , the world is on its way to ' a large scale disaster			1
' ' the longer we are stuck in a debate over ideology and politics , the more the costs of inaction grow and grow , ' the @entity147 official said in an official government statement			0
' those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids , ' he continued			0
the @entity4 report warned ' the atmosphere and ocean have warmed , the amounts of snow and ice have diminished , and sea level has risen			2
' ' it is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer , and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions , ' it went on to say			0
@entity2 , who has equated the importance of acting to slow down global climate change with the necessity of ending terrorism , proclaimed on sunday that ' greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are higher than ever , and we 're seeing more and more extreme weather and climate events			1
' that includes storms , heat waves and downpours , he said			0
and ' it 's not a coincidence			0
' ' with this report , we have yet another round of authoritative , peer - reviewed science to prove it , ' he asserted .			0
