alarming new statistics reveal that serious road accidents involving young children are at a ten - year high – particularly among girls			1
the report says the smartphone phenomenon is a factor			0
‘ there is a clear correlation between the use of technology and the time of serious accidents with children – particularly at the time of leaving school for the day , ’ it concludes			2
parents are giving the phones to their children at ever - younger ages – often for reasons of personal security but in some cases having been nagged into providing one to keep up with their peers , say experts			2
nearly half of children aged ten have a smartphone , rising to three - quarters by age 12			1
perhaps significantly , the age of 11 is both the highest risk age for child pedestrians and the average age at which children receive their first mobile phone			2
the report – by insurance company @entity63 and backed by the road safety partnership @entity65 – is based on @entity67 statistics and a poll of 1,000 eight to 18 - year - olds who were questioned about mobile phone usage			1
it notes that a quarter of 11 and 12 - year - olds – acknowledged as the ‘ danger group for road casualties ’ – and about a third of 14 - year - olds ‘ reported that they were distracted when crossing a road due to using personal mobile technology ’			1
but the problem starts much earlier			0
‘ by the age of ten almost half of children have received their first mobile phone , ’ says the report			2
‘ by age 12 , 73 per cent of children have a mobile phone			2

this is an increase from ‘ twice as likely ’ just ten years ago			0
overall , 2,400 children under the age of 16 were killed or seriously injured on @entity11 ’s roads in 2011			0
but in five years there was a ‘ proportionate rise ’ in child deaths and casualties among pedestrians – from 61 per cent of all accidents in 2006 to 66 per cent in 2011			0
alarmingly , the proportion of death and serious injury on the roads among children under five is at the highest level for 10 years – at 14 per cent – ‘ and continues to rise ’			0
casualties for girls aged five to seven have risen by 45 per cent in the past five years – from 77 to 112 .			0
