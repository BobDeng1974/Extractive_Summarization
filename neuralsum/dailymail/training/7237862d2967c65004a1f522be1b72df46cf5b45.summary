a toy penguin featured in the @entity1 is already being sold on @entity2 for up to £ 500 - just one day after the commercial was released			1
@entity5 the @entity4 , the star of this year 's festive advert , flew off shelves and sold out online within hours of his screen debut yesterday , with parents forking out £ 95 for the cuddly toy			1
and many of those quick enough to buy @entity5 or his love interest , @entity15 , are taking advantage of the penguins ' popularity - by selling them online for more than three times the original price			0
the boy gradually realises @entity5 is longing for a penguin companion			0
and so on christmas morning @entity26 surprises @entity5 with the gift of a new penguin friend named @entity15			2
throughout the advert @entity5 is a @entity37 penguin , but at the end it is revealed to be a stuffed toy - and for a few hours you could buy him and his girlfriend online in various sizes for between £ 12 and £ 95			1
within hours the toys , which come in three sizes , had completely sold out online along with penguin - patterned pyjamas and cuff links			2
variations of @entity5 and @entity15 then began appearing online , with one @entity2 user charging an astonishing £ 499 for the pair			1
others listed a pair of 35cm toys for £ 124 , some £ 50 more than in stores			0
but , with more stock expected to become available today , a spokesman for @entity23 said customers eager to get their hands on a version of the toy need not worry			1
a set of the 25cm penguin - which costs £ 35 in stores - was being sold for more than double the price online another medium sized penguin was listed online for double the original price after the retailer sold out online within hours of the advert being released yesterday @entity23 sold out online			1
the retailer hopes to have more stock available today ' the advert has proved very popular , as it always does			2
' hopefully we will get more stock out today for customers to order online			0
@entity5 and @entity15 have not sold out in stores however , ' a spokesman told @entity76 this morning			0
but while online shoppers clambered over their keyboards to buy the toy , those in stores were not convinced of its steep price tag			0
@entity84 , a 21 - year - old student in the @entity86 store said : ' if it was a real penguin i probably would have bought it because i 've always wanted one			0
' why is it so pricey ? is it stuffed with gold ? ' @entity93 , 19 , also complained about the price : ' if that 's the thing that they are promoting in the advert it should n't cost so much - because @entity23 is ( usually ) an accessible store for everybody			0
' similarly , @entity101 , 24 , and @entity102 , 38 , who work at @entity103 , enjoyed the family - focused feel to the ad , but ms @entity102 said she would not be swayed by the £ 95 @entity5 toy			1
in the advert , a live penguin plays the role of @entity26 's best friend and sidekick in the boy 's @entity115 home after looking for love , @entity5 is given the best @entity119 gift he could have hoped for when @entity26 brings him a female penguin at the end of the two minute commercial it 's revealed that @entity26 had been playing with a cuddly toy and not , as portrayed , a live penguin ' i think it 's £ 9.50 for a bear in @entity23 at the moment , so i would n't buy a £ 95 @entity5			1
' every year merchandise linked to the department store 's seasonal advert has sold out within days of the hotly - anticipated commercial 's release			1
last year 's theme , which featured @entity136 and the @entity137 to a soundtrack of @entity139 singing @entity141 's @entity140 , saw alarm clocks and cuddly toys also pop up on @entity2 for more than double their original price			0
and in 2010 , @entity146 's @entity145 racked up tens of millions of views after being played in the retailer 's seasonal advert			2
