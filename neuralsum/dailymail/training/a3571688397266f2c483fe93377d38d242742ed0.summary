by @entity0 , political editor published : 18:39 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 18:48 est , 16 may 2013 education secretary @entity1 said opponents of planning reform undermine social mobility opponents of planning reforms are undermining social mobility , aspiration and the family by helping to keep home ownership ‘ the preserve of those with wealth ’ , @entity1 said last night			1
in an attack on @entity17 – ‘ @entity17 ’ protesters opposing housebuilding plans near their homes – the @entity1 insisted that property ownership was ‘ the foundation of a free society ’			1
insisting @entity21 needed ‘ many , many more ’ houses , he warned that the proportion of first - time buyers who do not rely on financial assistance from their families or others had crashed from 69 per cent in 2005 to 34 per cent in 2011			2
‘ no - one who believes in social mobility , in aspiration , in pro-family policies , in thrift and in freedom can be anything other than delighted by the release of more land for housebuilding , ’ he said			1
his remarks came in a speech that roamed well beyond his education brief amid increasing suggestions from conservative mps that he is a potential successor to @entity45			2
on wednesday , appearing before mps , mr @entity1 described himself as an ‘ heir to @entity48 ’ which only fuelled speculation			1
his aides denied the remarks were any kind of leadership bid , saying he had been talking in the context of schools reform			1
but @entity57 hit out at mr @entity1 for speculating about his position as leader of the @entity60 , telling @entity62 radio : ‘ @entity1 , who i think is a perfectly nice chap , does n’t know the first thing about the ( @entity60 ) ... of course , he knows a thing or two about leadership ambitions , but that ’s a different matter			1
’ however , the @entity1 , who insists he will not run in any future leadership contest , cast himself more as the government ’s latter - day answer to sir @entity72 , the intellectual driving force behind @entity74			1
mr @entity1 said sir @entity72 ’s involvement in reform of healthcare , repair of the welfare system , expansion of home ownership and attempt to improve state education over his ministerial career were reflected in an ‘ uncanny ’ way in the principal aims of conservatives in today ’s government			2
he said the ‘ animating mission ’ of the @entity91 was ‘ the determination to ensure all our citizens have the chances to live fulfilled lives ’			0
he said people who oppose undeveloped land , such as this village green in @entity100 , @entity101 , being used for house building do not believe in ' aspiration or pro-family policies ' ‘ we are fighting to make opportunity more equal , and to ensure that every citizen enjoys the dignity , autonomy and freedom which allow them to become truly fulfilled , ’ he added			1
mr @entity1 said the government ’s reforms of the bloated welfare state , the education system to give heads and parents more power and the @entity119 to put patients and doctors in charge were all about ‘ giving every individual a solid stake in our society ’			1
he said his greatest concern in education was ‘ the forgotten 40 per cent ’ of children who had become known as ‘ the tail - the underachievers concentrated in areas of disadvantage ’			0
‘ @entity133 is one of the most unequal nations in the developed world in terms of educational achievement , ’ he said			0
‘ just five schools - four independent and one sixth - form college in @entity140 - get more students into @entity143 than 2,000 state schools and colleges put together			0
' more boys get to @entity143 from @entity147 alone than from the entire cohort of children - 100,000 or so - eligible for free school meals			0
‘ our reforms are explicitly targeted at ending this scandal			2
’ @entity1 said people should not think about ' losing some undeveloped land ' but creating something of ' grace ' mr @entity1 said a pupil premium - investment rising to £ 2.5 billion by next year - directed funds towards the poorest children to raise their attainment			1
the government ’s academies and free schools programme , allowing schools to free themselves from state control , was allowing ‘ visionaries with a commitment to the highest possible standards ... to transform the lives of our poorest children ’			0
mr @entity1 also launched a staunch defence of the @entity173 and warned against ‘ clumsy and ill thought - out interventions ’ by @entity175 to impose new rules on the nation ’s economic powerhouse			2
‘ it has become fashionable to criticise the @entity173 and its workers , deprecate bankers and bash banks , look askance at financial services and look down on those whose trade is in money , ’ he said			0
‘ and certainly , given the behaviour of a number of egregiously greedy and foolishly reckless individuals , there had to be a change - of culture , attitude and regulation in the @entity173			0
‘ that is why @entity196 is introducing comprehensive banking reform - not to punish the city , but to protect an institution tarnished by a series of terrible errors			0
‘ but we would be making a grave historic error if we were to allow a determination to cleanse the stables to harden into a prejudice against those individuals and institutions we need to win in the global race			0

@entity211 said opponents of planning reforms undermine aspiration
he said people should not think about ' losing undeveloped land ' but creating something of ' grace and *beauty* '
