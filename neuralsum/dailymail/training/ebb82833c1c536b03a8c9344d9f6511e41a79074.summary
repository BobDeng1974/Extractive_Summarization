@entity1 's main sponsors @entity2 have warned they will consider tearing up their contract with the club if convicted rapist @entity5 is re-signed			1
the @entity7 club confirmed on tuesday they had not yet decided to re-sign @entity5 , but that the 25 - year - old would be allowed to return to training following a request from the @entity11			1
plenty have opposed @entity5 ' return to professional football , most recently tv presenter @entity15 , who was one of three club patrons to resign from their roles on wednesday			1
@entity5 will start training with his former club , despite opposition from some @entity1 fans and @entity2 say they will 're - evaluate ' their position if @entity5 is given a contract at @entity24 following his release from prison in october after serving half of a five - year sentence			1
' the club has confirmed to @entity31 that the player has not been re-employed , ' a statement read			2
' the training is with a view to enable mr @entity5 to return to a level of fitness which might allow him to seek employment within football			1
' @entity2 is a long established family business and condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms			1
' whilst ever the ' ex-player ' is not employed by @entity1 , @entity31 remains committed to its commercial partnership			1
should this situation change @entity2 will re-evaluate its position as shirt sponsor			1
' @entity5 is to marry his fiancee @entity50 after proposing shortly after he was released from prison @entity52 , pictured on @entity54 's @entity53 , said she put thoughts of @entity5 's infidelity ' to one side ' ' i think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on , you are not taking just a footballer these days , you are also taking on a role model , ' @entity59 told @entity67			1
' you are taking on a role model , particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that , and he has committed a very serious crime			2
' it is for the football club to decide , but i really do think that footballers these days , they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people			0
' i 'm sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of @entity1			1
' back - of - the - shirt sponsors @entity89 , on the other hand , have promised to sever ties with the @entity92 if @entity5 is given a contract at @entity24			1
' @entity89 is a business that has been built with family values at its core			2
it strongly condemns rape and violence of any kind against women , ' a statement from the transport company read on its @entity105 page			0
' @entity89 would end its back - of - shirt sponsorship with @entity1 if the club employed a convicted rapist			1
' however , whilst the current situation remains and @entity5 is not contracted to @entity1 , @entity89 will continue its business to business relationship with the club			1
' @entity1 manager @entity113 maintains the decision to let the former @entity116 player train was not rushed , and that @entity5 has a right to return to football			1
' everybody realises the gravity of the situation and seriousness of everything and that 's why it has taken so long to even get to this stage , ' @entity113 said			0
' it has been prompted by the @entity11 and that 's as far as it goes now			0
' we deliberated as a club for some weeks and came to this decision			0
according to the law of the land he is entitled an opportunity to resume his career			0
' @entity15 has decided to resign from her role as patron of @entity1 after @entity5 ' return ' @entity1 have n't made a statement for four months and today , in fact , i had a conversation with the chairman			1
it was a positive conversation and i walked away from that … i read the statement and i looked at what the club were saying , and the stance that they 've taken and the stance that the @entity11 have taken			0
' at no point has anyone made a decision and @entity1 still have n't made a decision			2
they 've succumbed to the @entity11 , the @entity11 have asked if they trained with him , the @entity159 have said it 's a ' dilemma ' and at no point have @entity1 acknowledged the extremity of his crime			2
' ' over 155,000 people now have signed a petition against @entity5 going back to the club			1
nobody 's making a decision and i suppose i feel that i need to make a decision as patron of @entity1			1
my decision , which i informed the club earlier on , is that i resign as patron of @entity1 and @entity174 , which is all about inspiring the next generation through sport			1
@entity15 appeared on @entity177 on tuesday night , and spoke strongly about her stance ' my decision is based on the fact that no convicted rapist , as in @entity5 , should go back to the club that i am patron of , and go back into the community and represent the community			1
' he 's not just going into a job , he 's bandied as a role model and we cheer him on as a role model , and he 's influencing the next generation of young men who are currently still making their decisions on how to treat women and what sexual mutual consent is			0
' i currently have n't had a response from the club but as i said i did have a conversation [ with the chairman ] which was very positive and friendly earlier on			0
they said to me that they still have n't made a decision but they have made a decision to let him come and train back at the club			2
' i hope [ that what i say now will have an impact ]			0
i 've spoken quite a few times now and now i 'm here speaking to you			0
i 'm trying to , i suppose , give victims of sexual abuse a voice because i think in this day and age , in 2014 , we 're a rich society – rich in education as well – and still there is n't an education on mutual consent			0
' [ on the fact that @entity5 has served his time ] ' the @entity11 are the players ' union so of course [ chief executive @entity219 ] is going to say that – his interest is only for the players and to make sure the players get the best out of their situation			2
' it 's the same union that has recently been sued for sexism because it did n't allow a woman into a dinner , so i do n't know what you would take from the @entity11			0
' why have the club chosen to listen to the @entity11 and not the tens of thousands of fans that say they do n't want @entity5 back at the club … ' @entity15 said : ' at no point have @entity1 acknowledged the extremity of his crime ' on @entity177 ' the point you 've just made is that he scores goals , so why would the club bring him back to train ? to me that 's for one of two reasons : the club are bringing him back to get him match fit to play , or they 're bringing him back to train him up to be sold in the january transfer window which is not a moral decision or a community decision , which clubs say they are all about			1
they are the heart of community			0
you can not have it both ways			0
[ on the crime being sexual ] ' there 's a lot [ on the @entity262 list of sports stars ' crimes ] so maybe the @entity159 , instead of saying ' this is a dilemma ' which is what the chairman @entity266 said , he should maybe do his job which is impose rules			0
' maybe the @entity159 should make rules so that players can be told what they can and ca n't do			0
in my mind they ca n't go and rape and then go back into their job to influence the next generation			0
to me , it is personal , because i can comment on sexual abuse because i have been sexually abused , but also because i 'm the patron of this club and of the foundation , and i was brought up in the community of @entity282 , and i 'm worried about my community			2
' a lot of the fans have spoken up but the fans who are supporting @entity5 maybe need to look at their own families and imagine what it would be like if it was their daughter or their wife or their mother , because one in five women in this country are sexually abused , which is a statistic that should n't exist in 2014			2
' the reason why is because nobody speaks about it and the reason why nobody speaks about it is because they get abused			0
me speaking about it , i 've been abused ; the lady that started the petition , she 's been abused … i got told i should have a slap around my face to get myself back in order			0
' @entity5 scored 42 goals in 103 games for the @entity92 , having previously played for @entity116 and @entity313			2

@entity315 sponsors @entity2 will 're - evalute ' if @entity5 re-signs
