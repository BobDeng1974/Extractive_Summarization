the black - lined jellyfish ' the size of a teacup and maybe the size of a saucer ' is apparently harmless , after a swimmer on @entity4 's @entity11 was seen weighing one up in each hand			1
@entity13 , said he spotted them from the roadside and on closer inspection realised it was the first time he had seen the species in the ten years he had been holidaying in the area			0
a mysterious swarm of stingless jellyfish said to look and feel like breast implants have washed up on a @entity4 beach a doctor holding breast implants that resemble the jellyfish spotted washed up in @entity27 , @entity4 ' there were swarms of them			1
they 're almost clear with a black ring around them , ' he told @entity35 ' they look like a standard jellyfish but with an odd colour			2
they 've very definitely got a black rim , and there are hundreds in each swarm , he added			2
the most common species of jelly in @entity4 is the stinging lion 's - mane jellyfish ( @entity48 species ) and the moon jelly ( @entity51 species )			1
@entity27 's @entity52 ( @entity52 ) said swarms of various species are common for this time of year			0
@entity55 , @entity52 principal scientist and jellyfish expert in @entity57 , said that without seeing the jellyfish himself it was difficult to identify the species but the dark radials extending out from its centre , suggest it could be hydroid medusa			0
he described them as looking like ' breast implants which had been badly handled '			1
they grows up to 175mm wide , are saucer - shaped and are fat in the middle and gradually thin out towards the edge			0
they were last seen in @entity4 in 2010 when the sea 's temperature was warmer than average			1
@entity74 , editor of @entity75 said : ' it could be one of thousands of species			0
' what 's more , they change in appearance throughout their one year life cycle as they grow			0
' the tend to come to the end of their lives in autumn , so that is probably why they have been spotted on @entity4 's beaches			2
