by @entity1 reporter published : 04:18 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 04:48 est , 3 may 2012 blind @entity3 dissident @entity2 today appealed to be granted asylum in the @entity5 - and begged to be allowed to leave with his family on @entity8 's plane			1
he said he feared for their lives should they remain in @entity3 , despite assurances they would be allowed to ' live free ' , and pleaded for a lift when the @entity5 secretary of state leaves after two days of strategic talks tomorrow			1
the self - taught lawyer 's plea has thrown into doubt the agreement used to coax him out of hiding from the @entity20 in @entity21 - and fanned @entity5 - @entity3 tensions at a sensitive time			1
@entity3 's @entity39 declined to comment on @entity2 's request to leave the country and repeated its criticism of the way the @entity5 had handled the issue as ' unacceptable '			1
@entity2 , a self - taught legal activist , left the @entity5 embassy yesterday and is now under @entity3 control in a @entity21 hospital			1
he had taken refuge at the @entity5 mission for six days after escaping house arrest and left after @entity5 officials assured him @entity21 had promised to improve his circumstances			1
but @entity2 said yesterday by telephone from hospital , where he was escorted by @entity5 officials and was being treated for a broken foot , that he had changed his mind after speaking to his wife who spoke of recent threats made against his family			1
he said : ' i feel very unsafe			0
my rights and safety can not be assured here			0
' his family , who were with him at the hospital , backed his decision to try to reach @entity5 , he added			2
free : @entity2 has left the @entity5 embassy ' of his own volition ' and was taken to @entity68 hospital in @entity21 talks : @entity8 ( left ) and @entity3 president @entity29 ( right ) during the first day of the conference and he told thedailybeast.com : ' my fervent hope is that it would be possible for me and my family to leave for the @entity5 on @entity8 's plane			1
' i hope to seek medical treatment in the @entity5 with my family , and then i want to rest			2
as for the future , we ’ll deal with that in the future			0
' a @entity82 congressman has accused @entity32 's administration of trying to sweep concerns over @entity2 ' off the table ' for ' happy ' diplomatic photos			0
@entity87 , for @entity88 , told @entity89 he has not spoken to @entity2 , who reportedly has asked for his help in leaving @entity3			2
but he said the @entity5 should ' without a doubt ' revisit his case and consider granting him asylum , as conflicting reports emerge about the safety of him and his family			2
@entity87 said : ' there is no safe place in @entity3 if you ’re a dissident			2
i think we missed an opportunity to press for asylum			0
' the activist , citing descriptions from his wife , @entity107 , said his family had been surrounded by @entity3 officials who menaced them and filled the family home			1
@entity2 , from a village in rural @entity115 province , has two children			0
he said : ' when i was inside the @entity20 , i did n't have my family , and so i did n't understand some things			0
after i was able to meet them , my ideas changed			0
' a senior @entity5 official later said the @entity5 was seeking to clarify @entity2 's wishes and continued to discuss his fate with the @entity3 government			1
the official said : ' when we feel that we have a clear view of what his final decision is , we will do what we can to help him achieve that			0
' the timing of the @entity2 case comes at a fragile time for both nations			0
@entity5 president @entity32 will be sensitive to any criticism of the handling of @entity2 in the run - up to a november presidential election			2
@entity3 is struggling to push through its own leadership change late this year			2
that carefully choreographed transition has already been wrong - footed by the downfall of ambitious senior @entity144 official @entity143 after he was caught up in a scandal linked to the apparent murder of @entity148 businessman @entity147			0
free : @entity2 's departure from the embassy came shortly after @entity5 secretary of state @entity8 arrived in @entity21 for two days of annual strategic talks harassed : mr @entity2 ( right ) says that he and his family have been abused while under house arrest @entity5 secretary of state @entity8 found herself in the eye of the diplomatic storm today , turning up for the opening of annual bilateral talks in @entity21 which have been overshadowed , but not derailed , by the @entity2 case			1
she used the occasion to urge @entity3 to protect human rights but made no specific mention of @entity2 , whom she had spoken to yesterday after he left the embassy			2
he reportedly told her ' i want to kiss you ' , as he thanked her for @entity5 's support in brokering the initial deal			2
' of course , as part of our dialogue , the @entity5 raises the importance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , ' @entity167 said			2
family : mr @entity2 's wife , @entity107 , was supposedly beaten by government guards and their daughter , @entity177 , was harassed human rights : mr @entity2 ( right ) met with the wife of a different human rights activist earlier this month while in his home , and he supposedly planned the escape for weeks by pretending he was sick ' we believe all governments have to answer our citizens ' aspirations for dignity and the rule of law and that no nation can or should deny those rights			0
' despite @entity2 's @entity192 about staying in @entity3 , it was unclear if he would be able to travel to the @entity5			1
@entity5 officials appeared no longer to be with him today , with the dissident saying he had still not had an opportunity to explain his change of heart to the @entity5 side			0
' i hope the @entity5 will help me leave immediately			0
i want to go there for medical treatment , ' @entity2 said from the hospital , where a pack of camera crews and reporters was waiting outside , kept away from the entrance by police			0
@entity36 had hoped its deal with @entity21 over @entity2 would defuse the crisis , with both @entity167 and @entity5 treasury secretary @entity209 in the @entity3 capital for this week 's talks - in which the @entity5 will aim to secure more cooperation from @entity3 on trade and international flashpoints such as @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217			1
under the deal , according to @entity5 officials , @entity2 and his family would have been relocated within the country in safety and he would have been allowed to pursue his studies			2
proud : while @entity2 was in @entity21 , his widowed mother and six - year - old daughter were believed to have remained under house arrest in @entity227 village in @entity115 province still in custody : mr @entity2 escaped on his own and is calling for an investigation into the treatment of his family but @entity3 authorities have taken a tough tone , criticising what they called @entity5 meddling and demanding an apology for the way @entity5 diplomats handled the case			1
@entity3 president @entity29 made no mention of the @entity2 case in his remarks to the @entity5 - @entity3 talks but stressed that the two nations needed trust			1
' it is impossible for @entity3 and the @entity5 to see eye - to - eye on every issue , but both sides must know how to respect each other , ' he said			1
earlier , in comments aired on @entity254 , @entity2 said : ' i would like to say to president @entity32 , please do everything you can to get our family out			0
' @entity2 , 40 , is a legal activist who campaigned against forced abortions under @entity3 's ' one - child ' policy			1
he escaped 19 months of house arrest , during which he and his family faced beatings and threats , late last month			1
@entity5 officials had said @entity2 left the embassy of his own free will because he wanted to be reunited with his wife and children			0
they said he wanted to remain in @entity3 and never asked for asylum			0
@entity2 's dramatic escape from house arrest and his flight last week to the @entity5 embassy have made him a symbol of resistance to @entity3 's shackles on dissent			1
the deal struck by @entity21 and @entity36 would have kept him an international test case of how tight or loose those restrictions remain			0
now , however , his change of mind throws not only his own future into doubt , but also raises questions about the wider @entity5 - @entity3 relationship			1
it could also prove politically costly for @entity32 , who has already been accused of being soft on @entity3 by @entity82 presidential candidate @entity290 and who could now face further criticism over @entity2 's case			0
what initially appeared to be a foreign policy success for the @entity32 administration could quickly turn into a liability .			0

threats to his family were real reason behind his return to authorities
