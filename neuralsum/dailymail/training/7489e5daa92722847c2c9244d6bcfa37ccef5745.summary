last july , @entity93 ( pictured above ) was convicted of murdering @entity94 in the village of @entity96 , @entity97 , while on day release			1

' i am not prepared to see public safety compromised			0
the system for allowing prisoners out on temporary licence has been too lax up till now and we are making major changes to address this ' ‘ temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but not at the cost of public protection			1
’ justice secretary @entity20 this morning added : ' i 'm not happy with the way things are at the moment			1
' although the number of people absconding is tiny , we 've seen in the last few months a number of serious offences committed by people on temporary licence			1
but we are tearing up the system as it exist at moment			2
' mr @entity20 said he would ban prisoners being allowed to walk around town @entity142 said : ' town - leavers will only be allowed out on temporary licence to do something tangible like a day 's work			1
' serious offenders will be subject to a much stricter risk assessment			0
and i ca n't see why we allow back into open conditions people who have absconded before , so i 'm looking at moving reforms in that area quickly			2
' people who have absconded can not go back to open conditions			2
these changes will happen within next few weeks			0
' but prison officers said overcrowding and job cuts were to blame for the escapes			0
@entity162 , chairman of the @entity163 , said : ' we have been saying for many years now that we have overcrowding in the prison estate , people are being put into open conditions who are unsuitable for open conditions			0
' twenty prisons have closed in the last three years and prison staff numbers have reduced by 6,000 since 2010			0
" there is immense pressure on the system and it is clear to me that the tick box mentality that goes into transferring prisoners to open conditions has failed the public			2
@entity178 mp @entity177 added : ‘ convicted murderers should not be released on temporary licence , it ’s common sense , the public are being put at unnecessary risk			1
the idea that there is a robust risk assessment in place is for the birds , the system is in complete shambles			0

how on earth people like this can ever be given temporary release from prison on licence is beyond me			2

i think the whole system is completely ridiculous			1
