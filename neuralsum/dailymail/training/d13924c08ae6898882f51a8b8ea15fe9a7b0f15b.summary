@entity0 had ' i 'm the best ' written on her bib but a big mistake wrecked her hopes of adding a 64th @entity6 victory to her record tally in a downhill won by @entity10 's @entity9 on saturday			1
the @entity11 , who became the most successful woman skier of all time last weekend , lost her line at the start of the lower section and narrowly avoided crashing to finish 2.08 seconds off the pace			1
' it 's unusual for me to finish 23rd but things like this happen from time to time and i knew it would be hard for me to stay in contention after such a mistake , ' she said			1

' written on her bib but the error meant she was not near the top @entity9 continued her love affair with @entity30 by winning her first downhill of the season on home snow in a time of one minute and 43.82 seconds			1

in third place , @entity68 became the first @entity71 skier on a @entity6 podium , 0.58 behind @entity73			0
@entity9 , of @entity10 , made the most of @entity26 's mistake to emerge victorious on saturday born in @entity76 26 years ago , @entity68 already made an impression at the @entity78 when she finished seventh in the downhill ahead of the @entity65 skiers with whom she trains			1
' it might be a surprise but i 've been close in the past , finishing fifth in @entity83 and also in @entity84			0
i skied well and i 'm not sure my bib number made a difference , ' said @entity68 , who started early in better wind conditions			2
