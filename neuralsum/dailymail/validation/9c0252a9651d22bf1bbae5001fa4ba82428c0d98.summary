' absolutely no peas ! ' booms @entity1 as he dispatches me to the market			2
i 'm in @entity4 , @entity5 's third largest city			1
not for the @entity8 festival ( a huge affair every march when giant papier - mache figures of politicians are burned amid lively street celebrations ) , but for its other claim to fame - it is the home of paella			1
@entity1 is a top chef who leads paella - making classes			1
but first i have to get the ingredients			2
dinner is served : @entity19 originated in @entity4 , using ingredients which could be sourced cheaply and locally the central market is in a glorious art nouveau building in the old quarter , with more than 500 stalls selling every @entity5 food imaginable			1
i buy an ' arrangement ' of rabbit and chicken portions from a butcher			2
then i choose three different types of beans			2
@entity32 was created from what was easily available to local farmers			1
this meant rice from the local paddy fields , and beans , rabbit and chicken from their land			0
it 's wrong to add peas , as we @entity45 do , apparently			0
under @entity1 's watchful eye , i learn how to chop the meat and cook it and the beans in different parts of the pan			0
i sieve fresh tomato and dabble in smoked pimento for flavour			0
the secret is about how to put the rice into the water			0
@entity1 tells me to add it in two straight lines in the form of a cross ( seemingly , for perfect absorption )			0
i add fresh rosemary , remembering to remove it after ten minutes			0
it seems to work and in around 20 minutes my glossy , golden rice dish is complete			0
@entity68 , though i say so myself			0
@entity1 awards me my diploma : i am now a ' paella ambassador '			2
if you want to know more about this famous dish and its variations , contact @entity74			0
originally from @entity75 , he moved to @entity4 23 years ago when he fell in love with a local , @entity77			1
a real mixed bag : true paella can contain seafood and rabbit - but should never feature peas they run the @entity84 , taking in all aspects of buying fresh produce at the market , cooking classes , wine tastings and a visit to @entity91 in the hills with lessons and meal preparation outdoors			1
you can also explore the famous rice fields of the @entity97 , just 15 minutes outside @entity4			1
you can take a boat trip on the vast lagoon or enjoy the pine - fringed , wild beaches and restaurants of nearby @entity106 village			1
@entity4 has fantastic white beaches , too , just five minutes from the city centre			1
there are endless orange tree patios ( proper orange juice everywhere ) ; walks along the former @entity113 riverbed ; the @entity114 listed @entity115 ( silk hall ) , which dates to1548 ; and superb shopping , including five @entity120 department stores			0
balconies of intricate metal designs and specialist cafes called horchaterias , with marble - topped tables serving a traditional @entity127 drink made from tiger nuts and sugar , remind me this is the real @entity5			1
@entity131 ( 020 7593 1899 , www.kirkerholidays.com ) has three nights at @entity133 from £ 559 per person , based on two sharing , including flights from @entity136 , private transfers and @entity138			0
