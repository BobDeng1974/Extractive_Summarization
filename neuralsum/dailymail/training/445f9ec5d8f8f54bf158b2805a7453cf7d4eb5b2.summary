if you were to guess what this prim - looking lady with neatly cropped hair sporting a drab grey cardigan gets up to at night , you might imagine it involves a hot mug of chocolate and earnest novel			1
but in fact , as these pictures show , she whips off her top , adorns her nipples with fluffy feathers and dons a bright pink wig to transform into @entity16 , her burlesque alter ego			2
photographer @entity19 decided to embark on a project showing the contrast between the real - life people and their glamourous and risqué stage personas			1
@entity19 explains : ' the shoots are more than anything an interview process			1
we talk about the " why " behind burlesque , how their families have reacted , what challenges they face among other things			0
' this helps make them really unaware that they are in my space being photographed			0
it disarms and gives them more power over the final image			0
' usually performers have control over their space and their crowd			0
when you take them out of that and place them in my studio , i have the power			0
' this is my way of trying to give as much back to them so that the images are as true as possible			1
' @entity74 is one of the burlesque performers captured : the fascinating pictures show the dramatic transformation of burlesque artists into their characters @entity80 by day and by night : each photography session took between two and five hours , during which time photographer @entity19 interviewed the subjects performer @entity84 : on the surface , burlesque may seem no different than stripping , but the photographer says it 's a form of artistic expression the photographer says he has friends in burlesque and has been going to shows for the past two years , but without much more than a surface interest			1
so what inspired him to start the photography project ? ' i was hired to photograph a burlesque show , but found myself fascinated by what occurred backstage and seeing ordinary people transform themselves completely in various ways			1
' then about a week later i happened upon a @entity101 video of @entity102 rehearsing , that was spliced with the actual performance she gave a few hours later			0
' it was really amazing , she appeared to be a drunken mess , or sleepy or whatever , but a wreck , mumbling words , etc. a few hours later she was just on and amazing			0
she had transformed completely for the stage			2
' @entity111 , photographed by @entity19			1
the photographer says : ' i hope this project allows people to delve further into the concept of quick judgment ' the photographer embarked on a project capturing burlesque performers , including @entity119 above , after he was hired to photograph a burlesque show and found himself fascinated by what was happening backstage the photographer says : ' i saw this exact transformation backstage during the burlesque show ( not from a wreck to something spectacular , but a transformation nonetheless )			1
' so , i began to reach out to the @entity128 community to try and photograph this process of transformation			0
the idea is very simple upfront , to juxtapose photographs of each performer as they are every day , with an image as their stage persona			2
' as i began to know the subjects personally , the project began to take on the task of confronting what viewers might believe burlesque is all about and any preconceived notions about what a person who does @entity146 might be like			2
' the photographer wants his project to clarify the distinction between burlesque and striptease			1
' for those unfamiliar , burlesque can , on the surface , seem no different than stripping			0
' all skin and bones : @entity159 's burlesque transformation it might be a woman 's burlesque world but that does n't stop @entity164 from lashing on the eye makeup @entity166 in and out of her burlesque costume but he explains : ' while striptease is also used in burlesque there is a distinction between the two			0
in burlesque , performers use their bodies as a tool to confront an audience , often using the striptease to challenge sexual objectification , orientation and other social taboos			0
' in this way performers are in control of their own bodies and how they are presented to an audience			0
this can make a lot of people uncomfortable and is in direct opposition to stripping where " performer " is reduced to no more than a sexual object , catering only to the sexual fantasies of the often male dominated , audience			2
' it is my hope that this project highlights that point by de-mystifying and showing each performer as a person who has ownership of their own body			2
i also hope this project allows people to delve further into the concept of quick judgment , and consider the individual , as well as the art of performance			1
' @entity210 undergoes a very scary transformation for her burlesque look @entity213 shows her sensual side in fishnets and feathers the performer who calls herself @entity218 does a ' cake smash ' for her photo @entity221 shows her wild side in her burlesque gear glitz and glam : dr @entity226 in one of the eye - catching images showing dancers before and after their burlesque transformation			1

photographer @entity19 , 31 , from @entity33 , captured these images

he says he hopes the project ' allows people to delve further into the concept of quick judgment '
