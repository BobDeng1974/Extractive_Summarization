by royal correspondent published : 18:54 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 9 july 2013 five days to go : the @entity2 ' due date is looming for most fathers - to - be , the mad dash to get to the hospital on time involves weaving through traffic and swearing at the dashboard			1
the @entity9 , however , has something a little more efficient up his sleeve – a helicopter			1
well , more precisely , it ’s in his back garden			2
with five days to go until his wife is due to give birth to their first child , prince @entity17 has borrowed a helicopter once used to circumnavigate the globe in record time			1
it means that the 31 - year - old duke , who is on duty this week as an @entity28 pilot , can cover the 288 miles between his base in @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , in just 90 minutes			1
the distinctive orange @entity35 four - seater helicopter appears to be on permanent standby in the garden of his rented farmhouse on the island of @entity40 in case it is needed to whisk him off			1
it was parked there last night			2
when the time comes , however , it is not believed that @entity17 would fly the helicopter himself			2
meanwhile @entity49 , also 31 , is dividing her time between their @entity33 apartment in the grounds of @entity53 and her parents ’ home in @entity56 , so she can be closer to the @entity57 of @entity31 , where she will give birth			2
the helicopter is owned by the prince ’s friend , fellow pilot @entity60 , who was @entity62 ’s stunt double in the @entity65 film @entity66			0
he occasionally offers the couple a lift in the aircraft if he happens to be ‘ routing past ’ @entity30			0
the @entity71 published exclusive photographs of such a trip last month			0
last night the couple ’s office at @entity53 refused to discuss the helicopter parked in the prince ’s @entity78 garden			0
the @entity9 and @entity49 and dog @entity80 with pilot @entity60 after landing at @entity83 , south @entity84 they also declined to comment on whether @entity17 had paid for it to be kept on permanent standby while he was on duty , or if it had been lent to them as a favour by mr @entity60			0
according to specialists @entity91 it would normally cost more than £ 1,000 a day to have a helicopter on standby , while the cost of a flight between @entity40 and @entity33 would be around £ 6,000			1
a spokesman said : ‘ a number of travel options are being considered for the duke should he need to travel back to @entity33 from @entity40 at a moment ’s notice			1
‘ this includes by helicopter			0
however he gets back to @entity33 will be at his private expense			0
’ mr @entity60 also declined to comment .			0
