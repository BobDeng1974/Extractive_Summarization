a fifth of patients say they would be willing to pay $ 1,000 ( £ 657 ) not to take drugs every day the study ' reinforces the idea that many people do not like taking pills , for whatever reason , ' said dr @entity26 of the @entity27			1
he added : ' and it reiterates we should be having discussions with patients about what their priorities are			0
' [ the question is ] ... if they value the extended life they might get from taking a pill more than the effect on their quality of life for having to take that pill every day for the rest of their life			2

they also asked how much people would pay to avoid having to take pills , and how much of a risk of death they 'd accept to avoid taking drugs to prevent heart disease			1
the pills would be free , and participants were told to ignore potential side effects			0
