students were told that prom would n't happen if pupils flunked their tests first their was outrage , then worry - now they see their principals ' point of view @entity9 is performing well and is on track to have a 90 per cent graduation rate prom seems to be back on - for now ! by @entity13 published : 08:44 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 18 march 2013 teachers have long tried various tactics to get their students to work hard from classroom treats to special school trips			1
but one @entity20 high school head decided to make an unusual threat to her students : graduate or else prom is off ! @entity25 , principal of the @entity26 in the @entity27 , stuck up a poster warning the pupils that unless all 140 students graduated , the senior prom would be cancelled			1
principal @entity25 : threatened to call - off the high school senior prom unless students worked hard and grades improve @entity37 , a senior at the school told @entity39 : ' it was a scare tactic basically for seniors to get their butts in gear			1
grades have apparently improved since the poster went up and now a new notice has gone up stating the prom is back on			2
when the @entity54 inquired about the unorthodox approach , ms @entity25 denied there was any ultimatum			0
she said the school had high expectations and that the prom would only be cancelled if the students did n't at least try and pass			2
administrators only made the announcement after they noticed grades had begun to slip			0
@entity26 in @entity27 , @entity20 : the school is already one of the highest performing in the area but this year they 're aiming for a 100 % graduation rate student @entity69 : the principal said cancelling prom was a scare tactic but it seems to have worked and everyone 's now working harder according to the @entity75 , the school is on track to have a 90 percent graduation rate , higher than the city average of 66 percent			1
many seniors at the school believe the principal did the right thing in giving them a wake - up call to buckle down as graduation nears			2
prom night : this @entity87 rite of passage is something all seniors look forward to			0
no wonder the threat of cancellation made them work harder the prom : one of the most important rituals of @entity87 youth ' we the seniors knew we could be doing better than we were doing , ' said @entity98			0
now the students can look forward to wearing their tuxes and ballgowns along with their diplomas .			0
