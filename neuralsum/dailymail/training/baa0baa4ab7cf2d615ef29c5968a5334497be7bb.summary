fashionistas may despair at the latest trend reports - but their granddads will be delighted			1
socks and sandals are the latest must - have look , according to a leading fashion editor			1
and it 's not the delicate shimmering sock with an elegant heeled sandal you 've seen at @entity11 and @entity12 but an altogether more masculine pairing			1
@entity14 has been braving the trend since spring , with @entity17 sliders			1
time to get some sheepskin ' stocks ? @entity20 and @entity21 wear the socks and sandals combination - apparently it 's the hottest trend this season it 's all about double - strap flats and thick , ribbed socks , says @entity27 , senior fashion news editor at @entity28			1
she has said that the @entity29 is a more affordable take on designer looks , but warns you must retain some bare skin and avoid covering up your whole leg to make it work			0
the look has been dubbed ' stocks and socks and is all about a silhouette of chunky sock and chunky , flat shoe			0
traditionally , it 's a look favoured by granddads and hippies and general creatures of convenience with minimal interest in fashion			1
but the past few months have seen it filter through designer catwalks such as @entity51 , through to fashion bloggers like @entity53 , and down to showbiz darlings like @entity14 and the @entity55			1
now , it 's stomping its way through social media and onto the feet of the fashionable woman on the street , says the @entity62			1
the @entity64 show for @entity65 ( l ) and @entity51 at @entity66 , also @entity65 ( r ) the @entity68 shoes with sheepskin lining ( l ) and a fashion show attendee in @entity71 this summer ( r ) ' flat sandals and socks look good worn with a pretty dress , bare legs and a chunky jacket			1
it does n't work with tights , ' says @entity27			1
' the sock needs to be substantial , something with a bit of a hiking vibe to it			0
best get them in a grungy colour , a grey or an olive or a brown , and wear them a bit slouched down			0
the whole look needs to be outdoorsy			0
it can work for men as well as women too , as part of that whole urban woodsman look			0
you know : the beard , lumberjack shirt , rolled - up jeans , sandals and socks			2
' while this look is always going to look great on a woman with long slim legs , like many things , socks and sandals can be flattering to lots of shapes and sizes because of the proportions involved			2
things that are heavier around the ankle make your leg look slimmer			0
this is why big chunky boots are currently so popular too			0
' birkenstocks were , of course , huge for summer			0
but fashion says you should consider carrying the shoe into autumn ( especially the new sheepskin - lined @entity124 style ) , paired with chunky socks			1
the look will definitely keep your toes toasty as well as , apparently , make your legs look slimmer and earn you plenty of fashion points			2
a couple of weeks ago , geeky @entity17 - strap sandal company @entity132 ran a promotion with @entity135 in @entity136			2
they celebrated socks and flat sandals by offering a pair of @entity132 with @entity141 socks at a $ 65 set			0
models in a dedicated lookbook were seen wearing the sandals with colorful socks and hipster - chic ensembles such as chambray shirt - dresses and acid wash joggers			1
and in an appeal to the snap - happy @entity152 set , the lookbook had the hashtag # @entity153 printed on the cover			2
but highly styled , long - limbed , airbrushed models are one thing , and real life is another			2
it remains to be seen whether even the most stylish women on the street will really adopt the look			0
are you convinced ? @entity165 in the old look of thin sock and heels in 2011 ( l ) and @entity169 rocking the current trend ( r )			0

traditionally a fashion faux - pas , the *dreadful* look is now ' on trend '
@entity27 , senior fashion news editor at @entity28 , says so
@entity12 and @entity177 started it , since seen on fashion blogger @entity53
woman on the street will soon be wearing the look , says the @entity62
