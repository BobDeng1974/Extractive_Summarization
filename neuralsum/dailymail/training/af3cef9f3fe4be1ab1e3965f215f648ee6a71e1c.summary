@entity0 already has a running mate for 2016 in mind , according to several news sources			1
@entity4 is reportedly eying incoming housing and urban development secretary @entity5 for the role of vice president should she run again and is keeping the former @entity8 , @entity9 , mayor and his twin brother , rep. @entity11 , ' very close ' just in case , says the @entity13			1
' clearly , if you were putting together a list of five people in the country who could potentially be a contributing running mate , you would have to put @entity5 on that list , ' @entity14 , former hud secretary for @entity4 , told @entity13			2
this photo of @entity0 and @entity5 , taken at an event in @entity23 last year , appeared on @entity11 's old facebook page , which has since been shut down to make way for his new housing and urban development secretary page			1
@entity4 is reportedly grooming @entity11 to join her 2016 presidential campaign as her number two ' a lot of people have mentioned the @entity4 - @entity11 ticket , which i think would be very attractive , ' @entity31 strategist @entity30 told @entity36 last year			1
the rising @entity31 star has long been considered a potential running mate for @entity4 or another @entity31 presidential candidate in 2016 , but until recently he did n't have the kind of national profile and experience that is generally associated with the nation 's second in command			1
that all changed when president @entity47 nominated him as @entity49 secretary in may , a position he was confirmed for last month			0
at 39 , @entity11 is now the youngest member of @entity47 's @entity51			2
@entity11 was previously approached by the president to serve as transportation secretary but passed , against the advice of his mentor			2
' i advised that he accept a position for president @entity47 , ' @entity56 , a @entity57 mayor himself , told the @entity62 in april			0
' i thought that if he was going to be vice-presidential material in 2016 , then he needed to be more than mayor at that time			2
' the second time around , the @entity66 politician accepted the opportunity to serve the president , a nod toward his own aspirations to become commander in chief			0
@entity11 is pictured here last month speaking to employees at the @entity49 after being sworn in as president @entity47 's newest cabinet member a graduate of @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity11 returned home and became the youngest person to serve on @entity79 before winning three terms as mayor of @entity8			1
he resigned that position at the end of last month to join the @entity47 administration			0
in 2012 @entity11 became the first @entity66 to give a @entity86 keynote address , rocketing him to national prominence			2
the relatively young leader has his first memoir coming out in 2015 - an important item on the presidential checklist			0
in a viral video produced for a 2012 gridiron dinner , @entity11 mocks his well - known presidential aspirations , asking his iphone : ' should i run for higher office ? ' ' @entity101 , mijo , of course you should , ' @entity98 responds			1
' your momma would slap you with her chanclas for asking such a question			0
' a smiling @entity11 tell his phone : ' thank you , @entity98 , it 's been a delightful conversation			0
' ' you 're welcome , mr. @entity109 , ' she replies			0
the humor of the faux phone conversation is not just in @entity11 's transparent political ambitions			0
it 's the fact that the politician of @entity66 descent does n't speak @entity117			0
still , he 's seen as the left 's answer to two influential @entity66 @entity121 - fellow @entity9 politician sen. @entity120 and @entity123 sen. @entity122 , both of whom are mulling 2016 presidential runs			1
if either lawmaker wins the @entity121 's nomination or earns a spot on the presidential ticket and @entity4 is the @entity31 nominee , @entity11 is considered the likely choice to join the @entity133 campaign			1
and , as the @entity13 and others point out , the @entity134 and @entity11 have an increasingly cozy relationship			2
in the last month @entity11 has appeared at an event in @entity138 with @entity0 and visited her home in @entity140 for dinner			1
sources present at the gathering told the @entity13 that @entity11 and @entity4 did n't have ' the talk ' at dinner and instead discussed his new job			1
but it 's likely that such a discussion will take place in the future if @entity4 throws her hat into the ring in 2016			2
asked by @entity154 ' @entity153 in may about @entity156 sen. @entity155 - another potential running mate - and @entity11 , @entity4 talked both @entity31 politicians up			1
they ’re both extraordinary leaders and great political advocates for a lot of what needs to be done in our country , and i admire both of them greatly , ' she said.for @entity11 , at least , the feeling is mutual			0
the former @entity8 mayor told @entity36 last august that he would support @entity4 if she ran for president again			1
' i believe she should and that if she does , she ’ll win , ' he said			0
' she ’s had an amazing career , understands policy backwards and forwards , and in 2008 , i was extremely impressed by her grasp of policy			0
i believe that she would offer very strong and steady leadership for the @entity177			0

@entity4 is said to be keeping the new @entity179 ' very close '
@entity11 had dinner with the @entity134 earlier this month and appeared at an event with @entity0 in july
@entity11 is the former mayor of @entity8 , @entity9 and is a rising star in the @entity31
