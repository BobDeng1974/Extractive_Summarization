by @entity0 last updated at 2:26 pm on 25th october 2011 allegations : @entity4 's former @entity3 @entity2 was said to have made important decisions while socialising with other politicians in the @entity4 @entity8 bar the former @entity4 prime minister made critical decisions about the country 's collapsing economy ' on the hoof ' while drinking in a @entity15 bar , a controversial new book claims			1
@entity3 @entity2 is accused of hampering the late @entity4 finance minister @entity18 's attempts to prevent the collapse of @entity4 's finances			1
the book also contains graphic descriptions of how the ' bar lobby ' and a party of what is described as ' drinking buddies ' would fetch pints for mr @entity2 and ' fill him up ' while he made key decisions about the @entity4 economy			1
when the @entity4 economy finally collapsed last november @entity30 and the @entity31 came to its aid with an € 85billion rescue deal			2
@entity34 contributed £ 7.5billion to rescue the so - called @entity35 , costing every family £ 288			0
one source quoted in the book said of @entity2 ' @entity39 ... he certainly drank an awful lot			2
everybody thought that when he became @entity3 he ’d stop , but he actually did n’t			1
' however , some ministers who worked alongside him have rejected the claim , that was one of a number leaked over the weekend ahead of the book 's release			0
it is claimed that mr @entity18 's career was stalled because he was not part of the @entity4 leadership 's infamous drinking circle , leading to mutual distrust at key times			1
among the most wild allegations apparently made in the book , it is claimed mr @entity2 and drinking pals would retreat to a cottage on the @entity61 - the country 's state guest house for foreign dignitaries - to carry on drinking			1
' bar lobby ' : former @entity4 prime minister @entity2 is accused of making decisions while in the bar , while excluding late finance minister @entity18 ( pictured ) the book , written by award - winning political columnist @entity69 and journalist @entity70 , is the first account of the simultaneous collapses of @entity4 's former leading party and its economy			1
it says that the relationship between mr @entity2 and mr @entity18 turned into an ' unholy union ' of two politicians who were ' distrustful of each other ' that only got worse under the pressure of economic collapse			2
the title reveals the astonishing way in which a culture of hard drinking at the @entity4 @entity8 bar took over the party to such an extent that mr @entity18 's non-membership of the infamous ' bar lobby ' damaged his relationship with mr @entity2			1
in the book , @entity93 notes that she did n't think ' @entity2 went on benders , i just think he drank steadily -- not during the day ... no , no , no , in the evening time when he 'd be finished in the @entity96 '			1
it is also revealed that mr @entity18 - who was battling pancreatic cancer throughout the critical period and died of the disease in june - went to mr @entity2 in september 2010 and pleaded with him to call an early election because he feared @entity4 was going to be bullied into accepting a bail - out			1
@entity103 suffered humiliation at the polls in february when they lost the country 's general election			0
the authors state that mr @entity18 fought hard against mr @entity2 's addiction to ' social partnership ' and that his attempts to rescue the economy were stymied by what he increasingly perceived to be ' a @entity3 who was a bit of a softie when it came to tough decisions '			1
drinking culture : @entity2 would drink at the @entity96 bar inside the @entity8 in @entity120 , the book claims it also paints a series of poignant portraits of mr @entity18 as a man alone who even mistrusted his civil servants and reveals that his battle with cancer played a critical role in his decision not to engage with mr @entity2			1
sources close to the former finance minister have revealed for the first time that he was ' devastated ' by having just two hours to tell his children he had pancreatic cancer before @entity4 television channel @entity137 made the news public , it was reported in the @entity139			2
' he said he only had two hours to tell the kids -- he was devastated by that			0
he never let the outside world know it , but it hurt him very badly , ' one source told the @entity139			0
claims : the allegations are made in this new book to be published next week during his treatment , it has emerged that mr @entity18 regularly returned to work in his department and the @entity96 minutes after concluding his chemotherapy , rather than returning home to rest			0
in some of the most revealing testimony to date about his struggle with cancer , friends and political allies of mr @entity18 have told how he fought chronic pain and extreme tiredness while tackling the country 's financial woes			0
@entity2 , who was previously the nation 's finance minister , was earlier this year accused of doing nothing to avert the impending financial crisis in the 18 months before he was made prime minister			0
@entity34 was forced to step in to help save the @entity4 economy from collapse in november last year because state - backed banks were exposed to more than £ 100billion in terms of debt and @entity4 sovereign bond purchases			2
it was argued at the time that as well as the damaging levels of bank exposure , @entity4 , as @entity34 's fifth - biggest trading partner , could not be allowed to sink into financial catastrophe			2
current finance minister @entity178 said he believed @entity2 avoided taking necessary action because it could have damaged his career			0
mr @entity178 said : ' i would think the calculation was that if he had acted when he knew how bad it was , he would n’t have become @entity3			0
' he would have lost his support base within the party			0
so i blame him for that			0
because he ’s a very intelligent guy , @entity2 is			0

@entity3 @entity2 ' would drink all evening in @entity4 @entity8 pub '
@entity191 hampered in attempts to prevent bail - out ' because he was n't part of drinking circle '
' everybody thought that when he became @entity3 he ’d stop drinking , but he actually did n't '
