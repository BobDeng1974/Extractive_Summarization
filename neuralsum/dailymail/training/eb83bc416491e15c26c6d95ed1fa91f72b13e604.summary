it took an uncomfortable motivational speech from a few unknown fans at @entity4 railway station to knock @entity5 into some kind of shape			1
it was horribly personal towards @entity9 and i have huge sympathy with the @entity13 manager for the abuse he had to suffer in those circumstances after the 3 - 2 defeat			1
but it did the job @entity9 seems incapable of			0
it got the players playing for him , and it even got the @entity23 crowd singing his name after saturday ’s win over @entity26			0
@entity9 looks dejected after @entity5 lost to @entity4 earlier this month of course , @entity5 have a habit of smashing inferior opponents and then failing badly when it matters , so let ’s see how the revival against @entity31 and then @entity26 works out going forward			1
and what a stroke of good fortune when the @entity13 picked out @entity34 in the @entity35 draw			2
if they do n’t get through that @entity9 should resign on the spot and hang his head in shame			0
but against a backdrop of embarrassing defending , lack of leadership , strange tactics , fans arguing and even fighting among themselves , and a manager being abused by the club ’s own supporters , one player has stood out with his quality , his attitude and his demeanour			2
i ’ve seen @entity5 several times this season and on each occasion the @entity56 has played well , i ’ve never seen his shoulders slump when things were going wrong , i ’ve never seen him abandon the sinking ship			1
@entity56 has been one of @entity5 's star performers this season @entity56 never lets his head drop when playing for @entity5 what i love about the way he plays is that he is so dynamic : every time he gets the ball i sense that something exciting is going to happen			1
and he ’s not a one - trick @entity66 either			0
he can run with the ball , he can spot and execute a pass – and a killer pass to - he can cross , and he can finish			0
he played the full 90 minutes in @entity70 and then produced a man - of - the - match performance against @entity26			0
in the @entity72 or the @entity35 the ox has proved he can play in different positions and still produce quality			0
and he can change a game – i was in @entity77 in 2013 when he came on as sub and transformed @entity79 from a side being overrun by @entity81 , to a team dominating the game			1
he also scored a wondergoal in the @entity85 that day			0
@entity56 seems to have the ability to perform at whatever level and on whatever stage you ask him and it was @entity79 ’s misfortune he was injured for the @entity90 – i believe he could have made a difference			1
so did @entity92 , that ’s why he took the gamble and took the @entity66 to @entity81 in the summer			0
sadly it did n’t work out			0
@entity56 scored an excellent goal for @entity79 in the @entity85 against @entity81 last year in my view he should be playing regularly for @entity5 – he ’s been in and out of the line - up this season but has started the last four games – and should be a permanent fixture for @entity79			1
he rarely has a bad game , is usually a threat and so far in his career he has conducted himself impeccably			1
future captaincy material ? i ’d say so			2
one final thought on @entity5 ’s win over @entity26 : a decent display from @entity109 , and some have given him credit for staying on his feet in the box instead of going down screaming for a penalty			1
but what i did n’t like from @entity109 was the dinked penalty at the end			1
some call it cheeky , i call it disrespectful and unprofessional			2
@entity109 chips the ball over @entity26 keeper @entity122 to score his penalty @entity109 should have shown more respect when taking his penalty @entity122 is a rookie keeper , @entity26 ’s third choice , on his full debut he ’s already had to pick the ball out of the net three times , and knows he ’s likely to have to do it again as he sets himself for @entity109 ’s penalty			1
i ’ve no problem with the @entity132 scoring the penalty – of course not			2
but why is he so keen to humiliate and embarrass a young fellow professional ? it lacked class and there was simply no need for it			0
@entity109 could learn from the @entity141 who chose to take their foot off the gas against @entity81 in the @entity90 semi-final – that could have been double figures easily			2
the @entity132 is a good player – he does n’t need to resort to such nonsense .			0

@entity5 fans gave their side a wake up call at @entity4 station
@entity56 rarely has a bad game for @entity5 or @entity79
*midfielder* is a future captain of the @entity13
@entity109 should have shown more respect with his penalty
