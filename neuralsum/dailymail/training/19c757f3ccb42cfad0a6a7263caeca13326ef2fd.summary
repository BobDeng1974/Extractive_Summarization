legal past : @entity1 , pictured in 1980 , helped a man accused of child rape get a lighter sentence in a newly unearthed audio interview @entity1 reveals how she managed to get a plea bargain for a man accused of raping a 12 - year - old girl - and shockingly laughs as she indicated she knew he may have been guilty			1
during the course of the conversation which dates from the early 1980s , @entity1 , then 27 , outlines how she used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41 - year - old @entity14 to walk free			1
indeed , so cavalier is her attitude to securing the freedom of a man suspected of raping a child that the shocking and candid interview may tarnish her role as an advocate for women and children in the @entity24			2
the recordings which date from 1983 - 1987 were discovered by the @entity26 and are of @entity1 recalling her role in the most important criminal case of her career			1
this is not the first time that the trial has been written about			0
in 2008 at the height of her primary battle with @entity36 , a @entity38 story focused on @entity1 's deeply controversial strategy of attacking the credibility of the girl			1
' @entity43 , records show , questioned the sixth grader ’s honesty and claimed she had made false accusations in the past			0
she implied that the girl often fantasized and sought out ‘ older men ’ like @entity14 , according to a july 1975 affidavit signed ‘ @entity43 ' ‘ in compact cursive , ' wrote @entity38			2
scroll down to listen to the @entity52 difficult case : @entity1 ( seen here in 1975 ) defended @entity14 , a 41 - year - old accused of raping the child after luring her into a car that same year in 1975 , the year she married @entity57 , @entity1 was the court appointed attorney for @entity14			1
the frontrunner for the 2016 presidential race goes into detail over five hours with @entity64 reporter @entity63 during the interview , which was intended for an @entity67 profile that was never published			2
@entity1 describes @entity14 as ' one of those rootless folks ' and claims that the trial was a ' really interesting case			1
' @entity14 was accused of raping the 12 - year - old girl in may , 1975 , in @entity73 , @entity74			1
the girl was a family friend and @entity1 has acknowledged in her past 2003 memoir , living history , the difficulties the case provided her having just moved to @entity81			1
to run the @entity64 ' new legal aid clinic			2
' this guy was accused of raping a 12 - year - old			0
course he claimed that he did n’t , and all this stuff , ' says @entity1			2
however , what is most shocking is the breezy manner in which she discusses her clients crime and the offhand way in which she questions his innocence			0
' i had him take a polygraph , which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs , ' she says with a laugh			0
listen to the @entity100 : career path : @entity57 and @entity1 in 1969			2
in 1975 , the year the couple were married , @entity1 represented @entity103 in her first trial as a criminal defense lawyer indeed , @entity1 laughs during several different parts of the interview - especially when she discusses the forensic lab destroying key evidence - which led to @entity14 getting away with the crime			1
but , @entity111 , a professor of legal ethics at @entity113 , told the @entity26			0
' we do n’t have to believe the client is innocent … our job is to represent the client in the best way we can within the bounds of the law			0
' however , he did raise the possibility that @entity1 may have breached the attorney - client privilege by discussing the case so openly			1
' you ca n’t do that , ' he said			0
' unless the client says : ‘ you ’re free to tell people that you really think i ’m a scumbag , and the only reason i got a lighter sentence is because you ’re a really clever lawyer			0
’ @entity14 was accused of plying the girl with whisky and coke and raping her in his car that evening			2
part of the prosecution case against him was the testimony of the girl , two witnesses who saw them together and a ' pair of men 's undershorts taken from the defendant herein			1
' crucially , even though @entity1 was attacking the credibility of the girl 's character , it was the underwear that allowed her client to walk free			1
' you know , what was sad about it , ' @entity1 told @entity63 , ' was that the prosecutor had evidence , among which was @entity14 ’s underwear , which was bloody			1
' advocate : @entity1 , former @entity24 secretary of state , speaks at the @entity164 's 40th @entity163 in @entity165 september 30 , 2013 however , the crime investigation lab failed to handle the evidence correctly			2
' the crime lab took the pair of underpants , neatly cut out the part that they were gon na test , tested it , came back with the result of what kind of blood it was what was mixed in with it – then sent the pants back with the hole in it to evidence , ' said @entity1			0
' of course the crime lab had thrown away the piece they had cut out			0
' jumping on this error , @entity1 had the underwear taken to a renowned @entity187 forensic expert for confirmation that this evidence was now compromised			0
' the story through the grape vine was that if you could get this investigator interested in the case then you had the foremost expert in the world willing to testify , so maybe it came out the way you wanted it to come out , ' she said			0
' well this guy ’s ready to come from @entity187 to prevent this miscarriage of justice , ' said a laughing @entity1 on the tape describing her conversation with the @entity74 prosecutor			1
in his opinion there was not enough blood on it to test and this ultimately caused judge @entity209 to decide that offering @entity14 a plea deal would be the best option			0
distressed : the victim has accused @entity1 , pictured at the @entity164 's 40th anniversary last year , as a hypocrite for calling herself a champion on women 's rights accusations : @entity1 , pictured with daughter @entity218 earlier this month			1
the victim of a sex offender she represented has spoken out about how @entity1 treated the case @entity14 , who died in 1992 , pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a child and was sentenced to one year in prison , which was reduced to two months for time served			1
however , her cavalier attitude to the rape case comes just over six months after she was honored by the @entity164 at its 40th anniversary soiree last september at the @entity231			0
and , ironically , the trial was instrumental in @entity1 co-founding the first rape crisis hotline in @entity81			1
but not once in the interview with @entity63 does @entity1 mention the hotline she set up or the impact of the case on the 12 - year - old girl			2
the @entity26 tracked down the victim , now aged 52 , who still lives in @entity241			0
she said that she was divorced and an addict to methamphetamines and was in prison for check forgery to pay for her drugs			0
she expressed hostility towards @entity1 for getting her rapist off and said her life has been miserable since .			0

@entity1 defended @entity14 , 41 , in 1975 in @entity81 , @entity74
then aged 27 , @entity1 found a *loophole* in the prosecution case and @entity14 walked free
newly unearthed audio interview from the early 1980s has @entity1 discussing the case with @entity64 *journalist*
recordings throw into question @entity1 's claim to be a champion of women and children 's causes
@entity14 died in 1992 and his alleged victim is now a drug addict still in @entity81 , @entity74
