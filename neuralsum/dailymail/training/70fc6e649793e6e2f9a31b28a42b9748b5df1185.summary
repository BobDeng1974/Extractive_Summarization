by @entity0 last updated at 12:01 am on 19th august 2011 pope @entity1 has denounced economic structures that put profits ahead of people at the start of a trip to recession - hit @entity7 where the costs of the pontiff 's visit have sparked violent protests			1
' the economy can not be measured by the maximum profit but by the common good , ' @entity1 told journalists on the plane taking him to @entity17 for a four - day trip centered around the @entity21 's @entity20 festivities			2
' the economy can not function only with mercantile self - regulation but needs an ethical reason in order to work for man , ' he said			1
scroll down for the @entity1 's full schedule in @entity17 and video ... popular figure : the @entity1 is swamped by thousands of supporters as the entourage winds its way through central @entity17 the @entity1 arrived in @entity17 to jubilant scenes yesterday morning at the start of a four - day trip to the @entity7 capital			1

the @entity7 economy is struggling to exit a recession which has left one in five unemployed , of which a large proportion are young people			1

eight people were hurt and eight were arrested as a result of clashes between pilgrims and protesters , police and emergency services said			2

@entity1 expressed his solidarity and support for young people faced with an uncertain jobs outlook , but warned of the challenges of consumerism and hedonism and the ' widespread trivialisation of sexuality ' in a speech on his arrival at @entity17 's @entity139 airport yesterday morning			0
he reinforced his message later to the young pilgrims in @entity99 square , criticising people who ' create their own gods , believe they need no roots or foundations ... letting themselves be led by the whim of each moment '			0
