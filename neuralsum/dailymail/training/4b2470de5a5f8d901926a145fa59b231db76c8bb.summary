@entity1 racing director @entity0 declared himself satisfied despite a difficult opening day on @entity4 's official return to @entity5			1
after 20 years being powered by @entity8 , the @entity7 - based marque are now reunited with @entity4 , rekindling memories of their glory days together in the late 1980s			1
on the first day of the new partnership at a two - day post-season test in @entity14 , @entity4 naturally encountered teething problems with their version of the 1.6 - litre @entity19 turbo - charged power units that were used over the past season by rivals @entity8 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
on two occasions there were issues with the fuel / data exchange , the second of which brought out a red flag leaving driver @entity26 stranded on the circuit			0
but with the two days designed to iron out problems ahead of the first pre-season test of next year in early february in @entity73 , @entity0 was happy enough			2
' running a modern @entity5 car is a very complicated procedure , ' said @entity0			2
' this week 's test is all about how the departments at @entity81 , @entity82 ( @entity4 's bases in @entity78 and the @entity79 ) and @entity7 learn to work with the operational hub at the circuit			2
@entity1 and @entity4 hope to bring back the glory days of the late 1980s and early 1990s when drivers such as @entity40 helped the duo dominate @entity5 as a team @entity1 have ended a 20 - year partnership with @entity8 which included highlights such as @entity92 's first championship win in 2008 ' this test is an opportunity for us to build up that operational strength , to get @entity1 and @entity4 working together under the same roof			1
' we encountered a number of issues , including a lengthy check of electrical installations this morning			0
' but it 's satisfying to see we got the engine fired up , the car out of the garage and some laps on the board in the afternoon			0
' we 're not chasing laptimes this week , it 's about gradually expanding our knowledge			0
' tomorrow will hopefully be all about conducting longer runs as we learn about different parts of the engine , and run through each separate system			0
