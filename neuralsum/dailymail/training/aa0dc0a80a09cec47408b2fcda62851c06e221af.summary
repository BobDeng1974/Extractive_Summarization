@entity0 insisted yesterday she did not authorise the publication of her explosive letter to @entity3 , as she repeatedly stonewalled questions from @entity5 over how much she knew about the leak			1
as speculation swirled about the impact of her spat with the @entity11 on a forthcoming @entity13 reshuffle , mrs may told @entity5 that an inquiry by cabinet secretary sir @entity15 had cleared her of releasing the correspondence			1
the letter , which was published on the @entity19 website , dramatically escalated a bitter row between the two ministers over extremism in schools			2
home secretary @entity0 listens to questions from the despatch box , with communities secretary @entity26 ( centre ) keeping her away from @entity13 rival education secretary @entity3 ( right ) mrs may hit back at criticism of her handling of anti-terror policy , and showed no sign of backing down in her row with @entity3 the home secretary was asked seven times by @entity5 about whether she knew the letter to mr @entity3 would be made public at some point , whether it was written in order to be leaked , and why there was a three - day delay in removing it from the website			1
but she would say only that she had not authorised its release			0
@entity47 claimed the publication of the letter – in which mrs may demanded to know what the @entity50 had done about warnings of extremism in @entity55 schools in 2010 – was a breach of ministerial code if it was authorised by the home secretary			1
asked by @entity47 mp @entity60 whether she knew her special adviser @entity62 – who was forced to resign at the weekend over the incident – was going to publish the letter , mrs may simply insisted it was ‘ a bit rich getting so many questions about special advisers from the party of @entity70 ’ , a reference to @entity73 ’s disgraced spin doctor			1
later , as mr @entity3 took questions from the @entity75 , he found himself sitting next to mrs may @entity47 's @entity76 accused the government of losing control of policy to deal with extremism asked by veteran @entity81 whether she was battling mr @entity3 because she was ‘ getting ready for a succession battle ’ for the @entity84 leadership , mrs may replied icily : ‘ i do not think that question should be dignified with a response			1
’ shadow home secretary @entity76 said : ‘ the home secretary claimed she did not authorise the release of the letter			2
yet time and again she refused to answer whether she wrote it in order to leak it , who did release it and why she left it on the @entity19 website for three days			0
’ there is anger among some @entity84 ministers that mr @entity3 , who started the row by using lunch with the editor of @entity100 to attack mrs may and her counter-terrorism adviser @entity101 , has been let off with a slap on the wrist			1
persistent : the home secretary , pictured with aide @entity62 who resigned last week , was asked seven times by @entity5 about whether she knew the letter to mr @entity3 would be made public at some point @entity108 is finalising a government reshuffle which is expected to take place within the next week			1
and one @entity13 source said : ‘ @entity3 was on the move to party chairman – it has certainly been discussed			0
‘ now it looks harder to do it because it would appear like a demotion because of the row with @entity0			0
@entity3 has done this over and over again – had a row internally and then leaked it – and people are frankly fed up with it			0
’ events last week were ' shambolic for the government , but much worse for everyone else ' and must not be repeated , said the shadow home secretary			2
she demanded assurances from mrs may and mr @entity3 that they ' will not put their personal reputations and ambitions ahead of making the right decisions for the country '			2
ms @entity76 asked why mrs may had allowed her letter to remain on the @entity19 website for three and a half days before it was removed , and demanded to know : ' did she write that letter in order for it to be leaked , and did she authorise its release to the media ? ' she asked whether mrs may stood by her claim in the letter that oversight arrangements for schools in @entity55 were not ' adequate '			0
mr @entity3 sat just feet away from mrs may , as she insisted she was in charge efforts to tackle extremism mrs @entity76 said that the @entity19 's strategy on preventing extremism had been ' criticised from all sides , not just by the @entity11 , for failing to engage with local communities and having become too narrow , leaving gaps			1
' she added : ' she now needs to focus on getting those policies back on track , because it matters to communities across the country that there 's a serious and sensible approach to these issues and joint working at the very top of the government			0
' to cheers from the @entity84 benches , mrs may retorted : ' we have excluded more hate preachers than any home secretary before me			2
i have got rid of the likes of @entity170 and @entity171			0
' the government does not give a public platform to groups that condone or fail to distance themselves from extremism and we are mapping out for the first time extremists and extremist groups in the @entity179			0
we make sure that the groups we work with and fund adhere to @entity179 values and where they do not we do not fund them and we do not work with them			0
' none of these things was true when the party opposite was in power			0
' mrs may called on ms @entity76 to withdraw any allegation that she had breached the ministerial code , saying that the prime minister and sir @entity15 had concluded that she did not			1
' yes , we need to get to the bottom of what has happened in the schools in @entity55 , but it is thanks to this education secretary that the @entity199 has for the first time a dedicated extremism unit to try to stop this sort of thing from happening , ' said the home secretary .			2

row *complicated* by ms @entity62 being in a relationship with mr @entity101
