in the audio recording , a voice purporting to be that of @entity16 states : ' i am @entity1			1
this is a voice message i 've been told to send to you			0
' if @entity23 is not ready for exchange for my life at the @entity27 border by thursday sunset 29th of january @entity30 time , the @entity5 pilot @entity22 will be killed immediately			1
' the message was posted on @entity32 early this morning			0
air pilot @entity33 was captured by @entity34 and along with @entity1 , is being used as a makeweight for the release of failed suicide bomber @entity37 , who is currently imprisoned in @entity5 following her involvement in a 2005 bombing			1
however , a government spokesman said she was still being held prisoner , while the country 's @entity70 reassured the pilot 's parents things remained ' positive '			1
an earlier statement from the country 's foreign minister said @entity34 had not proved the @entity5 pilot was still alive			1
at 3pm ( gmt ) yesterday , @entity78 wrote on @entity79 : ' we asked a while ago for proof that hero @entity82 ( @entity22 ) is alive but we have not received anything			2
' in @entity5 , the pilot 's father , @entity84 , begged the government ' to meet the demands ' of the @entity7 group			1
' all people must know , from the head of the regime to everybody else , that the safety of @entity94 means the stability of @entity5 , and the death of @entity97 means chaos in @entity5 , ' he said			0
@entity5 's @entity70 later met with the pilot 's parents and reassured them ' things were still positive ' , @entity99 reported			2

mr @entity103 made no mention of mr @entity1			0
mr @entity78 later said on his official @entity79 account that a @entity5 request for proof that @entity33 was safe and well had gone unanswered			2

the @entity3 deputy foreign minister was earlier reported as saying that mr @entity1 would be released ' within hours ' in a prisoner exchange deal for @entity37			1
if this morning 's recording proves to be a legitimate threat , this would appear to be incorrect			0
@entity151 , who is in @entity51 to co-ordinate the hostage - release efforts , reportedly said ' good news ' was expected in the coming hours , according to @entity154			0
rumours of the imminent release also circulated on other media			0
however , the claims were quickly denied by the @entity3 embassy			2
@entity5 is reportedly in indirect talks with the militants through religious and tribal leaders in @entity9 to secure the hostages ' release			2
earlier , mr @entity1 's mother made a tearful appeal to the country 's prime minister to save her son			1

although many in @entity3 are critical of the two men for going to @entity219 , @entity1 's friends and supporters have launched a social media campaign calling for his release			1
tuesday 's video resembled a message released over the weekend that purportedly withdrew a demand for $ 200 million in ransom for @entity1 and @entity226 made in an earlier message			2
the latest message condemns @entity5 for not releasing @entity37 , saying that unless she is freed within 24 hours , the pilot , followed by @entity1 , will be killed			1
it says it is the group 's last message			0
' i have only 24 hours left to live and the pilot has even less , ' says the audio			0
messages from other @entity236 hostages held by the group have been read by the captives on camera and it is unclear why the group released only a recording and still picture			0

he is the first foreign military pilot they have captured since a @entity265 - led coalition that includes @entity5 began its aerial campaign against the @entity261 in august			2
this is the first time that the group has publicly demanded the release of prisoners in exchange for hostages			0
previous captives may have been released in exchange for ransom , although the governments involved have refused to confirm any payments were made			0
@entity1 , a freelance journalist , was caught in october in @entity219 , apparently while trying to rescue @entity226 , 42 , who was taken hostage last summer			0
securing the release of @entity37 would be a major propaganda coup for the @entity7 and would allow the group to reaffirm its links to @entity63 in @entity9			0
the mother of another @entity5 prisoner , @entity284 , said her family was told the @entity7 group also wants his release as part of a swap , but it is unclear if that was related to a possible deal involving the @entity3 hostage			1
@entity293 , an aide to a former @entity63 leader in @entity9 , was sentenced to death in 2008 for killing a @entity5 citizen .			2
