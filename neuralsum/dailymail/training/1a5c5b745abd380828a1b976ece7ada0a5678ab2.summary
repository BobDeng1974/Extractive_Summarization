@entity1 may have closed his transfer window early this winter , but the @entity4 boss can be safe in the knowledge that with @entity6 sidelined whilst he recovers from a dislocated shoulder and @entity8 returning from illness , he has more than enough depth in the right - back position , according to @entity12			1
after a relatively quiet january at the @entity13 - with @entity1 bringing in @entity15 defender @entity14 and 17 - year - old midfielder @entity16 was full of praise for 19 - year - old defender @entity18 , who he believes is going from strength to strength			1
speaking as a pundit on @entity24 ' @entity23 , the former @entity26 and @entity27 right - back admitted how impressed he was with the young defender 's improvement this season since being thrust into the side against @entity32 in the @entity33 in september			2
@entity4 defender @entity18 celebrates with team - mates after his goal against @entity37 on sunday @entity18 impressed in the @entity39 ' convincing victory and scored a delightful placed effort from distance since being thrust into the limelight against @entity32 in september @entity18 has hugely improved with @entity1 short on options thanks to injuries to @entity6 , @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity18 - who made his @entity4 debut against @entity48 in the 2013 @entity49 before a short loan spell with @entity51 - was thrown in at the deep end at the @entity53 earlier this season when his side fell 2 - 0 to the @entity57 strugglers			1
age : 19 youth career ( 2003 - 2011 ) - @entity60 ( 2011 - 2013 ) - @entity4 senior career ( league ) ( 2013 - 2014 ) - @entity51 ( loan ) - 8 appearances ( 2013 - ) - @entity4 - 7 appearances , 1 goal however , despite admitting he was not impressed with @entity18 's maiden @entity33 performance in @entity69 , @entity16 thinks the @entity4 defender is finding his feet after solid performances against @entity73 and @entity37			1
' the one that stood out most for me having watched him come back into the team against @entity73 and see him at close hand [ against @entity37 ] was @entity18 the full back , ' @entity16 said			2
' he was thrust into the team in september [ at @entity32 ] and he really struggled			0
he looked like it was too early for him			0
the @entity83 's long - range strike against @entity37 topped off a great afternoon for the @entity39 ' he got put back into another big game against @entity73 and he was massively impressive			1
' the first thing is - has he got speed ? i was told he beat not only @entity89 's record but @entity91 's record for over 40 metres			0
' he 's lightning quick			0
that gives you a great chance as a full back			0
' the @entity39 are in a great run of form , winning five games on the bounce after their 5 - 0 dismantling of @entity37			2
pundit @entity12 said that the 19 - year - old is maturing into a fine full back since his @entity39 introduction up next are local rivals @entity106 who , like @entity4 , are hoping to work their way into a @entity33 spot with a win at @entity111			1
however , @entity16 expects @entity4 's short trip across north @entity113 to be a completely different kettle of fish for the youngster , with the likes of @entity118 and @entity119 in the form of their lives			2
' [ @entity18 is ] going to get tested by @entity119 at the weekend , who 's going to give him a different type of problem , ' @entity16 added			0
' but he 's come into the team and its great for a young player to see them develop and mature			0

@entity12 has been impressed by the *progress* shown by @entity18
@entity18 was forced into the squad at @entity32 in september
but @entity16 believes the 19 - year - old has since matured into a top player
