joy for pole - sitter @entity0 but ignominy for @entity3 and history - making of the wrong sort for @entity5			1
both their cars , @entity3 in one , @entity8 in the other , will be on the back row of the grid for the @entity12 @entity11			1
their participation ended with the doom - laden radio transmission to @entity3 , a three - time winner here at @entity16 : ‘ we have leapfrogged @entity8 , but unfortunately we are one - tenth short of @entity18 ( of @entity19 ) and out			1
’ in the @entity5 garage , chairman @entity20 watched on , wearing headphones , his neck extended , his face impassive			1
@entity0 celebrates his pole lap as he waves to the crowd at the @entity16			1
he qualified ahead of team - mate @entity28 and @entity30 driver @entity29 @entity0 gives his thumbs up to the crowd after sticking his mercedes on pole in @entity34 @entity0 was fastest in qualifying and will start on pole for tomorrow 's @entity12 @entity11 @entity0 celebrates his brilliant pole 1			1
pastor @entity46 1:29.480 - - - - - - - - - - 11			0
@entity53 1:29.209 - - - - - - - - - - 16			0
@entity8 @entity5 1:32.037 @entity5 were six seconds off @entity32 , who took pole through a lightning quick @entity0 , virtually six - tenths – a.k.a. an age – ahead of team - mate @entity28			1
@entity29 , of @entity30 , was third			1
it has been estimated that @entity5 could be 250 brake horsepower ( the equivalent of the @entity62 ) short of the @entity32			1
so much for @entity5 's new partnership with @entity62			1
so much for the rebuilding that was promised when @entity20 sacked @entity65 as team principal to take on the chief executive ’s role himself			2
@entity20 has inched ever more involved in the team , having originally promised to detach himself and leave the day - to - day management to @entity71 , the sporting director			2
the formula is not working even at their annual outlay of a mighty £ 200million			2
@entity3 will start sunday 's @entity12 @entity11 from 17th after a miserable qualifying session @entity3 leaves the pit - lane with his @entity5 team well off the pace at the first race of the season @entity5 will start from the very back of the pack ; they were some six seconds slower than the @entity32 re-live every moment of an incident - packed qualifying session in @entity34 you have to wonder whether @entity87 , who is missing this race after being concussed in a testing accident last month , will want to return for @entity90 a fortnight hence			1
a sick note from the doctor might suit him nicely			0
until , let ’s say , @entity94			0
by that race in september , @entity32 may nearly , or actually , have wrapped up the constructors ’ title			0
their dominance is so immense that @entity0 was 1.4sec ahead of @entity29 ’s @entity30			1
@entity0 , securing his fourth pole on the track where he made his debut eight years ago , said : ‘ it has been a great start to the weekend			1
it does not feel like a long time since the last race			0
' it has been a huge effort by the guys back at the factory so i feel incredibly blessed			0
it is so much fun in qualifying and i am massively grateful for all the hard work of the team			2
' four - time world champion @entity39 , on his @entity114 debut , qualified fourth in @entity34 @entity116 , in his @entity52 , takes a trip across the gravel			1
he will start 14th tomorrow @entity0 ran wide on his very first lap of the afternoon , but recovered to secure pole in @entity34 @entity0 , who started on pole here in @entity34 in 2014 , but retired with an engine problem , added : ' we had a difficult start to the season last year , so we a really hoping for a better start for both cars to succeed tomorrow			1
we are going to work as hard as we can , and it will be a good fight with @entity28			2
' @entity28 had to abort his first flying lap after running wide , but recovered to complete a @entity32 front - row lockout			2
he said : ' the story was @entity0 was in impressive form and he did an awesome job			2
' for me , the speed was there but i did not get it together			0
i am realy thankfulf for the team and the car they have given me			2
@entity142 , i will live with for now , but it is a long day tomorrow			2
' of the dominant @entity32 pair , third - placed @entity29 said : ' they are in a different category '			2
an ariel view of the @entity16 in @entity34 which plays hosts to the season - opening race @entity29 finished third in qualifying and claimed @entity32 are ' in a different category ' @entity5 would not have been at the very back had @entity151 not sat qualifying out			1
the team will not race either			0
their supposed rebirth from the ashes of @entity155 is danger of turning into a bad joke			0
@entity3 , however , believes this year 's @entity5 is essentially good , saying : ‘ i was always thinking long term when i re-signed			1
i really do think that in the end we can challenge @entity32 at the front			0
this a new package , not just in terms of the engine but the philosophy behind it , the aerodynamics and airflow			0
‘ i ’d rather not be at the back of the grid , but i am not sitting here downbeat			0
it is a tough time now and there will be tough times for many weeks , but it will make us stronger			0
‘ we have not done a race distance yet			0
so if we finish the race tomorrow it may not sound much , but it will help a lot			0
’ @entity49 , the youngest qualifier in @entity179 history at 17 years and 165 days , qualified 12th			0
he had ‘ a big moment ’ squirming wide at turn five and that left him four places behind @entity50 team - mate @entity183			0
@entity43 were disappointingly slow , with @entity51 only 13th and @entity42 seventh			0
sparks fly from the bottom of @entity49 's @entity50 ... the 17 - year - old will start 12th on sunday			1

@entity0 will start sunday 's @entity12 @entity11 on pole
the world champion was a mighty *0.6sec* quicker than rival @entity28
@entity29 is third on the grid with @entity39 4th in his @entity114
but @entity5 endured a *nightmare* @entity198 , with @entity3 and @entity8 *propping* up the grid on a bad day for the @entity202 team
