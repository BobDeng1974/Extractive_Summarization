uncertain future : @entity0 is unsure whether or not he will be manager of @entity2 next season opinions on @entity0 's tenure at the @entity24 have been split , while the experienced @entity26 boss is adamant he requires reassurances if he is to remain in charge			1
@entity0 said : ' i do n't know whether or not @entity2 have been working on ( next season ) for a long time			1
i have n't myself and of course if i do continue we will be at a disadvantage			0
' i need to know what sort of ideas they have got for @entity2 in the future			2
i want to be in the position of fighting for the same sort of position in the league that @entity2 achieved last year			2
' i understand that last season was very good for @entity2 and this season it was disappointing , with three head coaches , but in the end we did amazing work			2
' i will have enjoyed it if it has been my last game at @entity2 and if not i will plan for the future			2
i will look back very positively			0
i have learned a lot of things about how things are done differently			0

@entity59 could return after missing the last three games with a knee injury , while @entity62 is also likely to find himself back in the starting line - up after being rested for the trip to the @entity65			0
but @entity66 and @entity67 are both definitely out with hamstring injuries and @entity69 has a groin injury			0
welcome addition : @entity62 should be fit for @entity2 's match against @entity73 on sunday @entity0 added : ' i do n't think that we will lose 15 - 0 to @entity73 and @entity10 will beat @entity76 3 - 0 - if that did happen we would obviously be down to the @entity77			1
' but our attention will be on the game with @entity73 and we need to win this game			0
' i hope the fans have an enjoyable game and i hope to really be able to put aside the account we gave of ourselves at @entity58			0
