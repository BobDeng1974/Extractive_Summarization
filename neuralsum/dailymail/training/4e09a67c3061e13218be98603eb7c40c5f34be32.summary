an exotic tuna fish normally found in tropical seas off @entity2 and @entity3 has been caught in @entity5 waters for the first time			1
the 2ft skipjack was grabbed as it swam up the @entity8 at the seaside town of @entity10 , @entity11			1
fisherman @entity12 took it home to barbeque and said : ' the taste was incredible - it was just like steak '			1
@entity5 first : @entity12 holding the tuna 2ft skipjack tuna caught at the mouth of the @entity8 near @entity10 in @entity11 skipjack tuna are usually found in tropical seas but experts say the fish could have been attracted to @entity5 's coastline due to rising water temperatures			1
there are no records of one ever being caught in @entity5 waters			1
@entity12 and friend @entity31 had been fishing on the beach when they spotted the 20lbs fish in six inches of water in the river estuary			1
they tried to direct it back out to sea but the exhausted fish died			2
rather than leaving the tuna for seagulls to eat the pair gutted it and took it home to barbecue			2
floundering : the exotic fish has been caught in @entity5 waters for the first time after it was discovered thrashing around in the shallows strange find : the tuna was caught here on the @entity11 coast , far from the tropical waters you 'd expect to find it in @entity12 , 37 , an offshore diver , said : ' i was down on the beach doing a bit of spear fishing , something i do when the water is clear			1
' i was just getting my wetsuit on by the mouth of the @entity8 when i heard a noise that sounded like a dog splashing in water			2
' someone shouted that it was a salmon trying to swim up the river so i ran over and saw a big fish in about six inches of water			0
' i saw straight away that it was a tuna			0
i knew it was a rare fish so we tried to turn it round and send it back out to sea but it just kept trying to swim back up the river			0
' the fish was exhausted , it was clearly at the end of its life , and it died soon after			0
' we did think about leaving it for the seagulls but it was just too nice a fish to waste			0
' i gutted it on the beach and sliced a bit off straight away like sushi			0
the taste was incredible - it was just like steak			1
' i cut off a chunk for a lady who had watched the whole thing then took the rest of the fish to a local fishmonger to put on ice			0
' the next day i had family down for a barbecue so i cut the tuna into steaks and grilled them '			0
fellow fisherman : @entity31 waves the tuna but instead of being kept for posterity it was put on the barbecue @entity115 , chairman of the @entity116 , confirmed the skipjack tuna is the first to be caught in the @entity5			1
he said : ' there are no records of a skipjack tuna being caught in @entity5 waters so this is a first			1
' i 'm not surprised in the least though - every year we are seeing increasing numbers of what would be considered sub-equatorial fish in our waters			1
' @entity128 are warm water fish but it is likely it arrived on one of the warm currents flowing north from the equator			0
' fish are very sensitive to changes in the weather and are often ahead of the game in terms of finding new areas of the oceans to explore			0
' successful species like skipjack are good at finding niche areas and doing very well out of them			0
' skipjack tuna - @entity145 pelamis in @entity147 - are the smallest and most abundant of the major commercial tuna species			2
they are found mainly in the tropical areas of the @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity151			2
by night they swim near the surface but can dive up to 850ft during the day .			0
