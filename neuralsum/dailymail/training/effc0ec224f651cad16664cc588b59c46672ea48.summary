by @entity0 @entity2 boss @entity1 has admitted @entity3 was right to go public with his criticism of the coach 's tactics			1
@entity3 was unhappy @entity1 played with five defenders in their @entity9 opener against @entity10 - it was only at half - time , after the coach reverted to the usual 4 - 3 - 3 formation , that @entity2 began to look impressive			1
@entity2 face @entity15 in @entity16 in their second @entity18 game and @entity1 insisted that @entity3 had been right to speak out			1
' he likes to play 4 - 3 - 3 with ( @entity27 ) @entity26 up front			1
' he was asked how he likes to play and he answered what he thinks in a respectful way			0
we respect each other , we have a very strong team spirit			0
it is good to have an open dialogue with my players			0
' sometimes players learn from us the coaches and sometimes we learn from them			0
' we can all make mistakes you know			0
on sunday we will start with a 4 - 3 - 3 formation and we will take it from there			1
we may have to change the formation or not			0
' it was only after the change against @entity10 that @entity2 started playing fluently , culminating in an excellent individual goal by @entity3 , who said a 4 - 3 - 3 formation makes it much easier for him and fellow striker @entity50			1
@entity25 knows best ! @entity3 prefers to play using a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , similar to that used by his club @entity54 wing men : @entity2 's preferred formation sees @entity3 flanked by @entity57 and @entity50 ( r ) @entity3 said : ' as strikers we prefer that system as it gives us more attacking opportunities and if we do n't use that system we suffer a bit			1
' we as strikers favour that line - up			0
in the first half i was often on my own and so was @entity68 ( @entity50 ) and it was very difficult , so there are things to be improved on			2
' @entity1 said he had no issue with @entity3 going public over this concerns			2
' i am the one who encouraged @entity3 to ( say that ) and i fully trust all my players from a human and professional standpoint , ' he said			2
two - way street : @entity2 coach @entity1 insists he can learn from his players ' we have a two - way street in our dialogue because if you do n't let them say what they want to say then you wo n't get the best out of them			2
' @entity15 drew 0 - 0 against @entity89 in their opening game but coach @entity92 admitted they were up against it			1
he said : ' it will require a miracle since @entity2 is one of the best teams in the world and also they have one day of rest more than we do			0

@entity3 questioned @entity1 's tactics in their opening game
@entity2 started with a three - man defence before reverting to 4 - 3 - 3
@entity3 scored a *superb* goal in the 2 - 1 win against @entity10 in @entity18
@entity54 star prefers to be supported by @entity50 and @entity57
@entity2 play @entity15 in their next game in @entity114
