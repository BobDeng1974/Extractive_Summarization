it was announced last year that the 52 - year - old soprano would go on a £ 30 million eight - day mission to the @entity11			1
but yesterday the head of the @entity13 said the planned schedule may change , requiring cosmonauts to spend a month in orbit			1
the longer stint would be unsuitable for tourists such as @entity20 ’s ex-wife , who has passed the necessary medical tests			2
‘ if it ’s a monthly shift , then it will be staff cosmonauts performing short - term scientific research , ’ said space chief @entity22			2
some officials had complained @entity3 ’s flight was a publicity stunt			2
' it is very likely that the singer made an announcement about her possible trip to the @entity11 in order to advertise the release of her new album and to stir up interest in her world tour planned for next year , ' the unnamed source told @entity43 news agency			1
the source further claimed it was likely on the mission earmarked for @entity3 's flight in october 2015 all three seats would go to professional @entity5 cosmonauts			1
' it is not clear how the upcoming three years , one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling around the world , will affect her health , ' one was quoted as saying			0
at the time her trip was announced , the @entity13 had appeared enthusiastic about the planned mission			2
the former wife of @entity20 said at the @entity73 press conference announcing her flight : ' this voyage is a product of a dream , my dream			0
finally it can be a reality			0

one test involved being put in a centrifuge replicating the gravitational force she will face on returning to @entity100			0
she was also obliged to sit on ‘ a rotating chair that makes you sick ’			0
with @entity105 ’s space shuttles now retired , @entity5 soyuz spacecraft are the only vessels currently capable of carrying people to the @entity11			1
as a result , open seats available for tourists have been scarce in recent years			2
the most recent tourist on a @entity88 was @entity114 @entity113 founder @entity112 , who paid around £ 21.8million for his trip in 2009			1
@entity3 , whose 1978 single @entity116 reached number six in the @entity119 charts , said seeing fuzzy tv images of the first ‘ bouncing ’ human steps on the moon in 1969 when she was eight years old inspired her to dream about travelling to space			0
‘ it was something miraculous			0
for me , it was an epiphany , ’ she said			0
‘ it seemed so unrealistic and crazy at the time but i suddenly saw that it was possible			0
’ press conference : @entity3 said it was a lifelong dream to visit the @entity11			1

@entity131 has reportedly paid £ *30m* for a trip to the @entity11
