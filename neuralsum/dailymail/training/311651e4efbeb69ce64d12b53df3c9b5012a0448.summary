a culture of heavy drinking has led to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women – and they feel they have to put up with it , an academic report warns today			1
in a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24 - year - olds behave on a night out , a survey has found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping , but few were surprised			1
@entity14 said that excessive consumption of alcohol has turned @entity18 ’s pubs and clubs into a ‘ permissive social arena ’			1
police , judges , health workers and a @entity34 campaign all warned the policy would prove to be a disaster			0
the findings are revealed in a report for the charity drinkaware , which is urging women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober			0
@entity43 researchers found that 31 per cent of young women said they were touched inappropriately on a drunken night out			1
but only 19 per cent said they were surprised by it			0
in addition , more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) have put up with inappropriate sexual comments or abuse on a drunken night out			1
young men are not exempt – with one in ten saying they had to deal with unwanted physical attention or groping			0
researchers who interviewed and surveyed just over 2,000 young people pointed to a culture of heavy drinking , in which large amounts of alcohol are consumed before youngsters even leave the house			2
many young people believe they can not venture out to bars at night unless they have been drinking first			2
the report , written by the academics @entity62 and @entity63 , warns : ‘ the drunken night out provides an arena within which much more extreme social interactions are permitted			1
‘ a lack of clear boundaries means that people may easily be caught up in interactions which go further than they wish – or in which they do not wish to participate at all			0
‘ in particular , problems can arise around sexual behaviour , with molestation appearing to be a common and , to some extent , accepted part of a drunken night out			2
‘ low - level sexual molestation in particular appears to be becoming a norm			2
young women reported putting up with it as part of the culture of drunken nights out yet also say they find it unpleasant			0
‘ rebuffed sexual advances can also lead to violence : young men who are rebuffed in an approach are particularly likely to attack male friends of the woman who rebuffed them , or more generally start looking for a fight			0
’ the researchers found alcohol is commonly being consumed just to get drunk , rather than for pleasure , as youngsters work out the cheapest way of becoming inebriated			1
the report says : ‘ alcoholic drinks are treated as ethanol - delivery mechanisms , with calculations of “ units per pence ” and appropriate concentrations guiding choice of drink			0
there is social pressure to be as drunk as everyone else			0
’ chief constable @entity108 , who speaks for the @entity109 on alcohol , said : ‘ the consequences of excessive drinking are witnessed across the country in the hospitals and police stations of our towns and cities every week			1
