at the end the scoreboard said the difference was only three points			0
in reality , the gulf in class between these two teams was seismic			2
@entity8 huffed , puffed and attempted to blow down the @entity10 wall but ultimately the world champions had too much nous , too much power and too much quality			1
and in @entity16 they had one of the greatest players ever to have picked up a rugby ball			1
the 33 - year - old open side won his head - to - head with @entity8 captain @entity22 by a distance and showed yet again the value of having a genuine scavenging no 7 in the pack			1
@entity8 simply had no answer			1
@entity8 lost 24 - 21 against @entity10 at a rain - soaked @entity27 after an impressive second half from the @entity10 on saturday @entity8 's dominance in the first quarter could not be turned into points and the visitors took charge to settle the match @entity8 players look dejected during the demoralising defeat against @entity10 at @entity27 on saturday afternoon @entity8 look frustrated during their 24 - 21 loss against @entity10 on saturday afternoon at a rain - soaked @entity27 @entity8 went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive @entity10 team at @entity27 @entity10 celebrate as they beat @entity8 at @entity27 on saturday afternoon 24 - 21 with an impressive second half @entity8 : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 7 , @entity44 8 , @entity45 7 , @entity46 may 8 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 7 ; @entity49 7 , @entity22 7 ( capt ) , @entity51 6 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 8 ; @entity54 7 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 7 replacements : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 @entity10 : @entity66 6 ; @entity67 7 , @entity68 6 , @entity69 7 , @entity70 7 ; @entity71 8 , @entity72 7 ; @entity73 7 , @entity16 9 ( capt ) , @entity74 7 ; @entity75 , @entity76 6 ; @entity77 6 , @entity78 7 , @entity79 7 replacements : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 referee : @entity90 ( @entity91 ) in truth , @entity10 could have won this game by 15 points as they dominated the second half after @entity8 had given the record 82,223 crowd hope with a high - octane display to lead 14 - 11 at the break			1
but , with @entity16 — one of three @entity10 try scorers — playing so low to the ground he was practically in it , the @entity10 won the all - important breakdown battle and with it the match			1
once or twice the @entity10 skipper , winning his 135th cap , fell foul of referee @entity90			1
but more often than not his hands did enough to slow down @entity8 ’s ball or turn it over			1
one piece of second - half larceny following a charge by @entity49 enabled fly half @entity71 to scuttle up - field before punting the ball away for a gain of fully 80 metres			1
even with hooker @entity78 in the sin bin following a petulant kick at opposite man @entity55 , the @entity10 continued to play with calm authority			1
almost every decision they took in the second half proved correct			0
by contrast , @entity8 kicked poorly and failed to gain the territory they craved			1
with the industrious @entity45 at inside centre , @entity8 lacked a second kicking option alongside @entity47			1
well as @entity45 played in marshalling the hulking @entity69 , @entity8 will surely consider playing @entity47 at 12 alongside @entity64 next week against @entity127			1
coach @entity128 said : ‘ the weather turned and @entity10 maximised that opportunity well			1
when the hooker was in the sin bin they managed that opportunity well , too			0
‘ we could n’t get enough territory in the second half to get close			0
but we do n’t think we ’re too far away			0
‘ we had @entity10 on the ropes but we did n’t finish them off			1
’ @entity8 will put a brave face on this			1
they have to because they still have three @entity140 internationals to play this autumn			0
but there will be serious concern about their continued failure to put chances away , despite @entity147 ’s wonderful early try , which will live long in the memory			2
the @entity10 perform their haka during the @entity151 match between @entity8 and @entity10 at @entity27 on saturday @entity10 beat @entity8 after a courageous effort from the home side at @entity27 on saturday afternoon @entity147 scores a sensational solo try for @entity8 after three minutes as the fans at @entity27 celebrate in the background may celebrates after his superb try against the @entity10 that saw @entity8 take an early lead against visitors @entity10 may and @entity48 celebrate the opening try of the match between @entity8 and @entity10 on a wet saturday afternoon the @entity8 team gather together to celebrate the opening try against the @entity10 , though the conversion was missed afterwards the @entity170 winger , without a try in his previous seven internationals , received a wonderfully weighted pass from the excellent @entity44 and glided past @entity68 with astonishing ease before taking the outside line after being offered it by @entity66			1
the try , finished from 40 metres , provided hope for a repeat of the stunning triumph over the same opponents two years ago			0
but it was not to be			0
the @entity10 have lost only twice since lifting the @entity182 trophy three years ago and dug deep as @entity8 blew two gilt - edged chances			1
first , may gathered a bouncing ball superbly but failed to spot @entity47 on his outside as @entity66 made a desperate last - gasp tackle before @entity42 — normally so reliable — dropped a dipping @entity45 pass with the line at his mercy			0
@entity8 failed to stick the knife in when they had the chance			2
with almost their first foray into @entity8 ’s half , the visitors crossed when fly half @entity71 touched down			1
the crowd were incensed that referee @entity90 , who endured one of his poorest internationals , declined to go to the @entity197			0
replays suggested @entity71 may have been inches short			2
‘ we went to the @entity197 quite a lot of times but not on that occasion , which we probably need to have a chat about at some point , ’ said @entity128			0
‘ but we ’ll focus on our own performance			0
it was disappointing not to finish off one or two chances			0
’ @entity10 's @entity71 dives on the line to score the try that brought the two teams level early in the first half at @entity27 @entity71 of @entity10 takes his kick during the @entity151 match at @entity27 on a soggy saturday in @entity214 @entity8 's @entity47 takes a penalty during their clash with @entity10 at @entity27 on saturday afternoon the inconsistency in referring to the @entity197 certainly irritated @entity128 ’s opposite number @entity219			1
he was left fuming at the decision to refer @entity83 ’s 72nd - minute try as replacement fly half @entity87 was lining up the conversion following replays on the big screens			2
‘ the television producers are starting to have an influence on the game , ’ said @entity219			0
‘ if something goes wrong we see a replay 10 times when the referee , touch judge or @entity197 has n’t seen it			0
it ’s not in the spirit of the game			0
the producers are starting to annoy me			0
’ @entity8 began this game with seven injured @entity242 missing and fans have every right to ask serious questions about why a showpiece occasion such as this should be devalued by their absence			2
there is a lot of talk about the demands put on @entity8 players but not enough action to provide adequate rest periods			2
it would be churlish to ignore the positives , however			0
@entity53 — playing because of injury to @entity259 — was outstanding in the second row			0
new cap @entity61 also impressed after replacing @entity52 when he suffered a nasty head injury 23 minutes into the game			0
@entity264 - born soldier @entity43 barely put a foot wrong out on the right wing on an occasion charged with pageantry a day before @entity269			0
it was just a shame he did n’t see the ball enough as possession dried up and the rain came down in the second half			2
the diminutive @entity45 marshalled @entity69 well , while @entity44 was almost faultless			0
but ultimately , with 11 games left before next year ’s @entity277 , there appears to be an inescapable gulf in class that looks increasingly hard to bridge			2
@entity8 have much to ponder			2
a spell of pressure for @entity10 saw @entity16 gather the ball and drive over the line at @entity27 on saturday @entity16 dives over the line to score a try despite the best efforts of @entity8 's @entity55 during some very wet conditions @entity16 gives @entity10 a 16 - 14 lead against @entity8 as the @entity10 went on to win the match at @entity27 prince @entity290 pictured watching the match between @entity8 and @entity10 at a rain - soaked @entity27 on saturday			1

@entity147 scored sensational solo try for @entity8 after three minutes against @entity10 at @entity27
@entity71 brought it level to 5 - 5 but both teams missed conversions on a rain - soaked saturday afternoon
@entity8 went in at half time 14 - 11 up against @entity10 but the visitors ensured they kept within touching distance
spell of pressure for @entity10 after break saw captain @entity16 score try to make it 16 - 14
@entity8 ultimately slumped to their fifth *successive* defeat in a 24 - 21 demoralising loss against @entity10
