by @entity0 last updated at 10:15 am on 20th october 2011 a tearful @entity1 was led away from court in handcuffs and taken into custody today after a judge blasted her for violating probation			1
the troubled actress , 25 , had her probation revoked pending a november 2 hearing after judge @entity10 slammed her for failing to complete time at the @entity12			1
the @entity14 star is now understood to have been released after posting $ 100,000 and will not spend time behind bars - for now , at least			1
welling up : @entity1 appeared in a @entity18 courtroom today where a judge revoked her probation and ordered her into custody cuffed : @entity1 was led away in handcuffs and taken into custody after the hearing			1
it is likely she will post bail and be released by the end of the day booked : this photo was taken after she was taken into custody the outcome is pending the november hearing , which was scheduled by the judge today , where the court will hear further testimonies before deciding on the course of action			1
@entity1 was formally arrested in court today and taken into custody after @entity10 revoked her probation			2
on her booking sheet , the @entity40 accidentally listed her sex as male , and detailed how she weighed 116lbs			1
@entity10 said @entity44 should serve 16 hours at the morgue on clean - up duty between now and her next court hearing in an attempt to mitigate the current situation			1
the actress had been sentenced to 360 hours community service earlier this year as part of her punishment for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery store			2
during the hearing , @entity10 asserted @entity1 had managed to wilfully get herself kicked off the programme by cancelling on the women 's centre nine times			2
faces of pain : @entity1 was her usually - animated self during today 's hearing making an impression : @entity1 arrived to court in an eggshell blue dress and gold peep - toe heels , teamed with a @entity69 handbag , but was sporting rather heavy - handed make - up @entity1 welled up as her lawyer @entity71 fought her corner , pointing to the ' glowing report ' by the @entity74			1
but despite @entity1 completing some volunteer work this week at the @entity77 , the judge ruled it as void because it was not part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier hearing			1
she says @entity1 should have gone to the morgue for clean - up duty to complete some of the hours of community service instead - which was the second part of the probation @entity10 had originally stipulated			1
' nobody has the power to change my sentence , ' said an incredulous @entity10			0
frenzy : the actress was greeted by an army of photographers as she arrived at the @entity97 fighting her corner : she was represented by her lawyer @entity71 packing punch after punch , an unimpressed @entity10 told @entity1 : ' probation is a gift as i see it			2
there is something called looking a gift horse in the mouth			0
' @entity10 was also perplexed as to why the @entity74 had given @entity1 such a positive report			0
she said her work this week at the @entity77 would not count towards the 60 days of community service @entity1 has been ordered to complete			0
@entity10 also estimated that @entity1 has only managed to fulfil three days out of the 60 so far , also taking into account the time taken to complete a shoplifters course			0
she noted that @entity1 had been a no - show at the women 's centre nine times and had only managed to do around a day - and - a - half there			2
in the spotligh : teams of paparazzi and tv camera crews were on hand to capture the actress 's arrival and departure back home : @entity1 returns to her @entity127 home in @entity128 after a dramatic day @entity10 suggested it was @entity1 's inability to keep to schedule and disruption of the programme that eventually left women 's centre with no option but to cancel her role there			2
the star pulled up to the courthouse at 9.55am for the 10am hearing at the @entity139			0
dressed in an eggshell blue dress and white scarf , the actress was also sporting rather heavy handed make - up			0
she had her hair tied back in a ponytail and stepped out of her black @entity146 to a barrage of flashbulbs			0
the @entity14 actress has also served 35 days under house arrest this year as part of her sentence for the necklace theft			1
pulling no punches : judge @entity10 revoked @entity1 's probation pending a hearing arrest : @entity1 's sex is incorrectly listed as ' male ' on her booking sheet processed today following her court appearance the actress ' once promising movie career has been derailed by multiple trips to jail and rehab since 2007			1
the judge dismissed @entity1 's lawyer @entity168 's argument that the actress had to go abroad to work , where she has been seen partying over recent weeks in @entity171			1
' she is supposed to be an actress from what i hear , ' @entity10 said			0
@entity168 admitted that ' unfortunately ' @entity1 's career opportunity are not in @entity175 right now and that she has been to @entity171 to earn money to support herself and her family			2
but @entity10 was more concerned about the logistics of how @entity1 had attended weekly appointments with her @entity175 - based shrink , which was part of the terms of her probation			2
while the psychological report said she had attended every week , @entity10 was doubtful , pointing to the time frames of @entity1 's flights between various @entity171 destinations			1
judge @entity10 was sceptical about the glowing report written about @entity189			0
in the documents , the actress ' probation officer says her psychotherapist believes she is ' doing really well , she is making changes , and is trying to become more disciplined in her actions ' and that she is ' turning her life around '			0
the report also says she has been going to therapy every week , which the judge disputed because of @entity1 's travels overseas			1
the report details how @entity1 said the women 's shelter community service was not ' fulfilling ' - which was also slammed by the judge troubled : @entity1 and her bail bondsman will now have to deal with the paperwork to get her released from custody familiar scene : an outside view of the @entity97 in @entity18 where @entity1 attended today @entity1 was given a leave of absence from her shoplifting course to have emergency dental work done			1
it came just two days after her red carpet appearance in @entity18 where she displayed shockingly discoloured teeth			0
the actress 's probation report detailed various dates of her excused absences from probation , including october 14 for a trip to the dentist			0
' ms. @entity1 has not been absent to any regularly scheduled activities , except the session scheduled for her on friday , october 14 , 2011 due to her need to seek dental work , ' the report stated			0
' @entity230 presented evidence of attending her dentist office			0
as a result her absence was excused			0
