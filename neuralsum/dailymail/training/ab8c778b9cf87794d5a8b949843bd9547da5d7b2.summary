by @entity1 reporter published : 08:32 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 19:20 est , 27 november 2012 nine out of ten children under two have had the @entity5 jab – the highest rate for 14 years			1
the numbers are almost back to the point they were at before the scare that put many parents off giving their children the vaccine			2
altogether 91.2 per cent of those under two had received their first dose of the @entity5 vaccine last year , an increase from 89.1 per cent in 2010 - 11			1
children should receive their first dose of @entity5 vaccine between 12 and 13 months this is the first time the figure has hit the 90 per cent rate since 1997 - 98 , when 90.8 per cent of children had been protected from measles , mumps and rubella			1
it is slightly below the peak in 1995 - 96 of 91.8 per cent , according to figures from the @entity31			0
many parents refused to have their children vaccinated after dr @entity34 ’s 1998 research linked the @entity5 jab with autism			0
his study has since been discredited			0
children should receive their first dose of @entity5 between 12 and 13 months and then a second dose between three years four months and five years			2
experts welcomed the increase but pointed out it is still short of the @entity45 ’s target of at least 95 per cent of children being vaccinated			1
in @entity48 the figure is significantly lower , with just 86.1 per cent of children under two having the first @entity5 jab in 2011 - 12			1
the uptake was highest in @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54 where 93.5 per cent of children were vaccinated , according to the @entity31 ’s @entity58 immunisation statistics report			1
the uptake of the vaccination programme has varied over the last two decades			0
@entity31 chief executive @entity61 said : ' our annual figures have tracked the course of immunisation coverage for several vaccines for children over the years including that for measles , mumps and rubella			2
' today ’s report marks a significant point in the continued rise of @entity5 coverage since it hit a low in 2003 - 04 - as for the first time in 14 years nine out of 10 children in @entity79 have had the @entity5 vaccine before they turn two			1
' however , although @entity5 coverage at two years has risen in all regions of @entity79 , and overall the country ’s coverage has increased in recent years , the national figure remains below the @entity45 target of at least 95 per cent			1
' prof @entity87 , professor of paediatrics , @entity89 , said the upward trend for @entity5 uptake was encouraging			0
however , he added : ' measles cases are still occurring at much higher levels than previously			0
there are a lot of older children of different ages out there who missed one or both @entity5 doses over the last 15 years and they are vulnerable and able to pass the infection on to others			0
' measles is extremely infectious and only with continuous vaccine uptake rates at 95 per cent and above over many years can it come under effective control			2
we also need to keep our eyes open for cases of mumps and rubella and congenital rubella going forward			0
' any parents who decided against @entity5 in the past should now reconsider having their children immunised and contact their gp			0

nine in 10 children under the age of two received the first dose of the triple vaccine between 2011 and 2012
figures still fall short of 95 ***%*** target from @entity45
uptake varies from 86.1 ***%*** in @entity48 to 93.5 ***%*** in @entity53
