some say there 's nothing worse than when someone bumps into you and spills your beer			2
well , on saturday night , @entity7 ' @entity6 took it to another level			1
the 6ft 9in basketball player knocked into waitress , @entity10 , as he chased the ball during his team 's heavy defeat by the @entity14			1
the unlucky waitress spilled a tray full of beers over spectators and caused a disruption as cleaners had to mop up after the mishap			1
@entity6 did n't look happy about it either , though he wo n't be the one going home reeking of beer			2
sadly for the @entity7 that was the most lively thing they did on court all evening as they suffered a 114 - 77 defeat in the capital			1
the @entity14 led by 30 by the end of the third quarter as they convincingly ended a five - game losing streak , with thanks to @entity53 's 17 points and @entity54 's 15			2
' it 's not so much you 're in a rut and not playing the way that we 're capable of			0
that 's going to happen , ' @entity14 coach @entity60 said afterwards			0
' it 's reacting and how you get out of it			0
' throughout a couple of games in this stretch , we were kind of hoping we 'd go out and win a game			0
we need to win a game instead of going out and taking it and being aggressive			0
