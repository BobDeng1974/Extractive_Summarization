@entity0 ca n't wait for 2014 to be over but insists a year to forget is in the past as he prepares to start a new season at the @entity3 in @entity4			1
@entity0 , who won bronze at @entity6 , missed out on selection for the @entity8 as well as the defence of his @entity11 crown after a long - standing knee injury finally caught up with him			1
the 27 - year - old decided to get the problem sorted out once and for all , opting to go under the knife and undergo a long period of rehabilitation			2
@entity18 and @entity0 will compete in the @entity3 next year and while the wait has been a frustrating one , @entity0 believes adversity has only made him stronger as he eyes up a raft of medals â€“ and he says he 's saving a special performance for @entity4 next february			1
' i had to make a tough discussion in may time on whether to have surgery on my knee , ' said @entity0			1
' there was no real trauma or injury it just had been worn out through jumping on it for about 15 years			2
' i missed the whole outdoor season and had surgery which was a success			1
i 've been doing my rehab all summer and everything is going well and seems to be looking good for the season ahead			2
@entity0 poses with his bronze medal from the @entity6 - but says he 's had a tough 2014 ' missing the championships that i did especially the @entity8 , a home games , was tough			1
' knowing it was going on and i should have been there was tough			2
it 's put a new fire in me to get back out there , compete and win some more medals			0
' i 've always loved competing in @entity4 for the @entity3			1
the crowd 's amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic			0
you feel really intimate with the crowd			0
' it feels like home for me now and everyone gets behind me			0
it 's something i really want to do this season			0
if my body 's right i will be there			0
' but @entity0 , who has once again been awarded top - tier funding by @entity60 , admits the standard of world - class high jumpers has only got stronger in his absence			1
' i need to get to a place where i can challenge with the guys who have now pushed the sport on another few centimetres , ' he added ' jumping 2.40m does n't necessarily mean you 're going to win anymore which is crazy and has never happened before			0
it makes it exciting , it makes it difficult but it makes it a really good challenge			0
' the funding is fantastic			0
it paid for my surgery , it helped me decide to have the surgery and it 's getting me back on track			0
i can have as much physio and doctors as i need to try and defend the titles i have won and even win some that i have n't			2
' the @entity3 takes place in @entity4 on saturday , february 21			1
@entity3 's partnership with @entity60 reflects its wider commitment to inspiring healthy lifestyles for all , and complements grassroots campaigns such as @entity90 and the @entity91 .			1
