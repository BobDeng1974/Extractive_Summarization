a committee of @entity1 has called on the government to do more to stop citizens being duped by the ' copycat ' sites which are charging for services motorists have been warned to be wary of copycat government websites which are charging users for services that are normally free			1
unofficial websites which have been described as ' impersonators ' have led to drivers paying extra for services such as applying for a driving test or driving licences or paying the congestion charge			1
a cross-party committee of @entity1 has now called on the government to do more to stop citizens being duped by the ' copycat ' sites			1
the @entity23 said efforts were needed across @entity25 to tackle the problem , with search engines such as @entity28 being alerted to problem websites			1
the committee 's @entity31 chairwoman @entity30 said the government ' must do more to warn motorists ' about the misleading sites			2
the report looked into the work of the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) and the @entity40 ( @entity40 )			0
the @entity41 told the committee it had seen an increase in complaints about ' impersonator websites ' charging for services such as applying for a driving test or driving licences			1
the committee 's report said that in written evidence to the committee , the motoring organisation recognised there was a case for services that added value such as ' checking services ' or ' fast track services '			2
but it said the government agencies appeared to co-exist with alternative , unofficial ' service providers '			0
the @entity41 thought it ' almost immoral that ( such sites ) can ply a trade that basically tricks people '			0
' in the capital , @entity66 ( @entity66 ) had asked the @entity38 to send letters to drivers who had used an unofficial website to pay the congestion charge			1
@entity66 is also consulting on a proposal that it should refuse to accept payments from copycat websites or other unauthorised third - parties , the report said			2
the committee noted that the problem goes beyond the @entity79 , with the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) leading efforts to address the issue			0
the @entity1 heard that @entity80 tracks the activity of such sites and shares this information with @entity28 , and other search engines , so they can identify and take action against ' websites that add little or no value to existing online government services '			2
the @entity92 has also received an additional Â£ 120,000 in funding to ' clamp down on misleading websites '			0
the committee said the problems on the first day of the paperless car tax system , which descended into chaos with the @entity38 website struggling with the demand , were an indication of the challenges facing the government in moving services online			0
unofficial websites have led to drivers paying extra for services such as applying for a driving test ( file picture ) ms @entity30 said : ' @entity38 and @entity39 are important for delivering essential services related to tax , licensing , testing , and vehicle safety			1
' the @entity79 must ensure that its current re-organisation programme for these agencies delivers high quality services that benefit everyone			0
' the recent problems experienced by motorists when road tax renewal went online demonstrates the importance of responding to change , having clear communication with the public and an effective contingency plan to maintain confidence ' we welcome greater information sharing across the motoring agencies and the expansion of online services that we found were well - liked by many customers			0
' however , the motoring agencies must continue to meet the needs of those customers who ca n't access or use digital services			0
' linked to this the government must do more to warn motorists about misleading ' copycat ' websites that charge for services provided for free by motoring agencies			1
' we also call on @entity38 to do more to explain the legal basis for the sharing of personal data with organisations engaged in parking enforcement and the steps it takes to deal with private parking companies caught misusing personal data supplied by the motoring agencies			0
' @entity153 transport secretary @entity152 said : ' @entity154 's incompetent @entity137 has presided over digital tax disc chaos , delays to driving tests and rip - off copycat websites			1
' drivers deserve better , and this report is clear that ministers need to stamp out copycat websites and ensure motoring agencies have the tools they need to keep rogues off our roads			2
