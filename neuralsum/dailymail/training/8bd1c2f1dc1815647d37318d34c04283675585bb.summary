by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has admitted talking with @entity3 and @entity4 left back @entity5 at the @entity6 amid increasing concerns about his fitness			1
@entity5 , 19 , the world ’s costliest teenager when he left @entity11 for @entity12 in a £ 28million deal , was heavily criticised by @entity3 manager @entity14 over his training regime			1
and @entity2 , who named @entity16 as @entity4 ’s new captain in his first squad since @entity19 2014 , seems to have similar concerns			1
‘ when @entity14 talks to @entity36 then @entity36 will say to him , “ what you were saying to @entity5 is what i ’ve been saying to him ”			1
‘ i think a lot of @entity5 ’s situation is purely down to the fact that he is still young , his body is changing but i think he ’s aware that the work - rate which is required does mean he ’s got to work very , very hard on that aspect of his game			2
‘ i must say , watching him play in the matches for @entity11 — which caused me to select him — and watching him in the game against @entity50 when he played , he did n’t seem to have too many problems coping with the physical side of the game			0
having words : @entity14 put @entity5 on a special fitness regime during pre-season ‘ that does n’t mean to say he ca n’t be fitter and if @entity59 thinks that he can get him fitter then i ’m sure he will certainly have our approval			1
‘ @entity5 ’s been aware of it and he will get fitter and stronger , not least of all because he ’s still a very young man and his body has not yet reached its proper proportions for the level he wants to play at			2
’ @entity5 is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury and has not been named in @entity2 ’s @entity4 squad for wednesday ’s friendly with @entity68 at @entity69 and the @entity71 qualifier in @entity72 five days later			1
the @entity3 left back , who turned 19 in july , is still living in a city - centre hotel in @entity75 and is struggling to adapt to his new surroundings			2
@entity5 is just one of several @entity3 players who have been on the end of @entity14 ’s volatile moods as he continues to search for his first competitive victory in charge			1
making his point : @entity2 believes much of @entity5 's issues are to do with the fact he is young yesterday , @entity2 began a new chapter with @entity4 after making some radical changes to the squad for the games against @entity68 and @entity72			1
@entity90 defender @entity89 , @entity91 left back @entity92 , @entity94 midfielder @entity93 and @entity96 ’s @entity95 have been named in a new - look squad			0
@entity16 , who has 95 caps for his country , was confirmed as @entity4 captain following @entity103 ’s retirement from international @entity105 ’s decision to select @entity93 , who has made two appearances in the @entity107 for his new club since his move from @entity110 , is eye - catching			1
@entity2 said : ‘ someone who knows him well up there called him “ the ginger @entity118 ” and it would be delightful if that epithet turns out to be the correct one			2
i think that would be a hard ask			0
new leader : @entity16 was named the new @entity4 captain by @entity2 video @entity16 named @entity4 's captain ‘ we followed him in the opening games and i was at @entity96 v @entity94			1
at the moment , we have lost three central midfielders in @entity103 , @entity130 ( both retired ) and @entity132 ( injured )			0
‘ he plays in a position where vacancies can easily arise and we have to see how he gets on			0
’ @entity2 has a number of injuries to contend with			2
@entity5 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 are absent from the squad			2
@entity93 , has already been nicknamed @entity143 by fans in the @entity145 and yesterday his club manager , @entity146 , likened him to @entity4 1966 @entity6 winner @entity147			1
call - up : @entity93 is one of the new additions to the @entity4 squad ‘ he ’s a terrific player			0
the last time we won a @entity6 we had a ginger in @entity147			0
now we ’ve got another one			0
it ’s about time , ’ said @entity146			0
after naming @entity16 as captain @entity4 ’s manager surprisingly admitted the player had ‘ baggage ’			1
he said : ‘ it is wrong , i think , for me to look back too much into the past and any mis - demeanors the player may have had			0
‘ i ’ve got to say in the two years he has been with me , i ’ve had no reason at any time to question anything about his character , his desire to play for the country and the wholehearted , willingness to offer himself in any conceivable situation			0
‘ he has that baggage with him and he will have to accept that as a further part of the pressure along the way because , unfortunately , you ca n’t draw a line over the past			0
