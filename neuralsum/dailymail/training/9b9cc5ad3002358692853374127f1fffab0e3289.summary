by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:07 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 15 november 2013 evidence : this is footage from the video , where the officer , who has been blurred , asked the potential informant for details about students in return for cash police are spying on @entity14 students , with one undercover police officer secretly filmed asking a potential informant to relay information about political activities on @entity19 for £ 30 - a - time , it emerged today			1
the plain - clothes detective was caught on camera offering cash to an undergraduate to provide details about his friends and any links they might have to political or environmental groups			1
focussing on social media the officer , who has not been identified , asked him : ' can you have a look on @entity19 and let us know ? ' , adding : ' we can not hack accounts ... it would be more of an education for me '			1
the officer explained his force is hungry for inside information on groups at the 800 - year - old institution , so they could disrupt or manage any protests			2
he said it is ‘ impossible ’ to infiltrate the student union and other organisations with undercover officers so they must recruit informants instead			1
but his potential recruit instead wore a hidden camera and captured every word on tape to expose the undercover officer ’s tactics			1
the video raises fresh questions about the scale of police undercover activities targeted at legitimate and mostly peaceful protesters			2
it is also an utter humiliation for the officer who is likely to work for an intelligence unit responsible for policing public protests			0
@entity65 tried to defend his actions claiming officers can use ‘ covert tactics ’ to help in the ‘ prevention and detection of criminal activity			1
’ but senior officers nationwide have repeatedly signalled that such intrusive tactics should only be used against the most dangerous criminals			0
there have been a series of scandals in which undercover officers ran amok among protest groups , fathering children and adopting the identities of dead babies			0
protest : anti-chinese protesters , none of whom are linked to today 's revelations , are controlled by police in @entity14 as they fight for a free @entity89 message : a @entity14 proctor walks though the middle of the protest , as students , again not linked to today 's story , stage a sit - in in opposition to @entity98 plans to introduce student fees the latest controversy emerged after the activist , aged in his 20s , was approached by the police officer by telephone			1
he attended a police station twice and was asked to launch a secret spy operation on the political activities of his friends and students			1
the officer asks the man to target ‘ student - union type stuff ’ , claiming this would be of interest to police because ‘ the things they discuss can have an impact on community issues			1
’ during a lengthy chat , he asked for the names of students who attend protests , the identities of their leaders and details of their vehicles			0
the potential informant is told to also focus on @entity131 , @entity132 and environmentalists , including those opposed to fracking			0
wearing a blue and white striped t - shirt , the burly officer also asked the student to monitor @entity19 for details of forthcoming events			2
he said that when groups hold meetings they may ask the potential informant to attend and pay him around £ 30 for his time and effort			0
the officer said : ‘ let ’s keep it small , you know little things that go on , little meetings that happen where they are going to discuss different issues in @entity14 , whether it be , such as at the university or those sorts of things			0
’ targets : footage of the interview reveals that police are want information on @entity164 students , which the force says helps the ' prevention and detection of criminal activity ' the activist was first contacted at the beginning of october , before contacting @entity172 newspaper which helped record the meeting			1
he believes he was chosen because he was a member of anti-nuclear groups and had been arrested three times on demonstrations			0
last night , the failed attempt to recruit the activist was blasted as a ‘ a gross abuse of surveillance powers			0
’ big brother watch director @entity180 said : ‘ for the police to pay students to infiltrate and spy on anti-fracking or educational campaign groups , where there is zero suspicion of any wrongdoing , is a gross abuse of surveillance powers			2
‘ coming after attempts to discredit the family of @entity191 and undercover officers fathering children with activists this episode makes clear why the police should not be able to approve their own undercover surveillance operations			2
’ ‘ were it not such a stark reminder of the weak oversight of police intelligence operations you ’d be forgiven for thinking this was the plot for a student film , albeit inspired more by @entity204 than @entity205			1
’ @entity206 , of the @entity207 , said the move undermines the legitimate right to protest			0
she said : ‘ this revelation is an absolute scandal			0
we now need to know just how widespread this practice is			0
’ @entity214 said it was ‘ absurd ’ that its members were a focus for the police			2
a spokesman said : ‘ tactics such as these are not only intrusive , they also waste time targeting groups which are involved in making important and positive change in our society			0
’ @entity65 said : officers use covert tactics to gather intelligence , in accordance with the law , to assist in the prevention and detection of criminal activity			1
