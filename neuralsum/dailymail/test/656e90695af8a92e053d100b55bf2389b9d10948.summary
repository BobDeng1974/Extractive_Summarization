@entity0 will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety @entity0 will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety			1
the controversial sweetener has been linked to a range of health problems , although research has shown it to be safe			1
@entity10 said today it is dropping the ingredient from the popular drink in the @entity13 in response to customer feedback			1
@entity0 , @entity16 and @entity17 will now contain sucralose , another artificial sweetener commonly known as @entity20			1
the decision to swap sweeteners comes as after a decade of plummeting sales			2
consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners , specifically aspartame			1
the ingredient , used in fizzy drinks and diet products , has been at the centre of critical reports dating back decades linking it to everything from cancer to premature birth			1
this is despite the @entity38 stating that more than 100 studies support aspartame 's safety			1
however these assurances have failed to convince some people , who continue to report adverse reactions , such as headaches and nausea after consuming foods containing the sweetener			2
the sweetener , which is about 200 times sweeter than sugar , is widely used to sweeten diet sodas			0
it is also used by rival @entity52 in its drinks such as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
in a statement today , @entity10 said : ' diet cola drinkers in the @entity13 told us they wanted aspartame - free @entity0 and we 're delivering			1
' the reformulated drinks will begin appearing on shelves in august			2
sales in @entity10 's beverage business have been hurt by a long - term decline in soft drink sales in the @entity13			1
and @entity52 said this week that sales volume for @entity54 fell 5 percent in @entity67 in the first three months of the year			0
executives at @entity52 and @entity0 blame the declines on perceptions that aspartame , first sold under the brand name @entity73 , is not safe			1
consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners , specifically aspartame despite aspartame 's poor reputation , it has been ruled a safe food ingredient by food watchdogs in @entity83 , the @entity84 , the @entity13 and around the world			1
last month , a study commissioned by @entity83 ’s food watchdog found eating the sweetener had no impact on the body or behaviour of people who claimed to be sensitive to it			0
@entity94 has established itself as an important component in many low - calorie , sugar - free foods and beverages and is primarily responsible for the growth over the last two decades in the sugar - free market			1
it is currently consumed by over 200 million people around the world and is found in more than 6,000 products			0
these include carbonated soft drinks , powdered soft drinks , chewing gum , dessert mixes , puddings and fillings , frozen desserts , yogurt , tabletop sweeteners , and some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar - free cough drops			2
@entity94 is a nutritive sweetener made by joining two amino acids ( protein components ) -- l - phenylalanine and l - aspartic acid , with a third component called a methyl ester group			1
very little is needed for a sweet taste , making aspartame virtually non-caloric			0
180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose			0
source : http://www.aspartame.org / the research had been evaluated by independent experts , peer reviewed and published in the journal @entity131			0
in december 2013 , the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) published an opinion on aspartame following a full risk assessment and concluded it was ‘ safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure '			2
this was supported by @entity83 ’s @entity140 which said the sweetener was safe and there was no need for action , such as taking it off the shelves , to protect public health			1
but @entity148 , professor of @entity149 at the @entity150 , insists there is good quality independent research which raises safety concerns			0
an @entity84 funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby			0
it is rare for a mother to be to give birth early - before 37 weeks - assuming all aspects of the pregnancy have been normal			0
the research found this low risk was increased by 38 per cent if the woman was drinking an average of one can of diet drink a day			0
the statistics , gathered by academics in @entity174 , showed that a woman who routinely drank at least four cans a day could increase the risk by as much as 78 per cent			0
this meant that if the risk of a premature birth was normally one in a 100 , it increased to 1.78 in 100			2
the professor also highlighted work by the independent @entity185 in @entity186			0
scientist there have published research suggesting aspartame caused several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current acceptable daily intake for humans			0
despite having virtually , if any calories , but low - calorie artificial sweeteners actually raise the risk of obesity , researchers fear			0
the popular sugar alternatives found in diet drinks and in sachets in cafes and restaurants may also increase the odds of diabetes			2
the sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin , which is found in @entity211 , sucralose , which is found in @entity20 , and aspartame , which is found in many diet drinks			1
the @entity216 researchers warned that ‘ today ’s massive , unsupervised consumption ’ of artificial sweeteners needs to be reassessed .			0

@entity94 has been linked to a range of health problems
but more than 100 studies have *deemed* it to be safe , says the @entity38
@entity0 in the @entity13 will now be sweetened with sucralose , or @entity20
comes after consumers *shy* away from such drinks on health grounds
