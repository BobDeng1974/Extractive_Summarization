but @entity7 operator @entity6 have taken out a survey which shows that lottery winners have a surprising number of purchases in common			1
around half of winners move within three months of a big win and a poll of new millionaires found almost a third ( 29 per cent ) bought a hot tub and a similar number ( 28 per cent ) had a walk - in wardrobe			1
nearly a quarter ( 24 per cent ) had electric gates at their new home , one in five ( 22 per cent ) set up a games room and 17 per cent bought a snooker table			2
a fifth ( 22 per cent ) bought a dog while one in 25 ( 4 per cent ) got a cat			0
how would you spend yours ? @entity6 have revealed how winners spend their millions some 16 % adopted a healthy lifestyle with a gym in their home and one in 10 ( 12 per cent ) installed a bar to have drinks to celebrate their good fortune			1
one millionaire admitted having three pianos in their house and another said they bought a wishing well			1
just under one in 10 ( 9 per cent ) said their new house had a river or lake in the grounds			0
surprisingly , less than a third ( 30 per cent ) said they employed a cleaner to keep their new home spick and span			0
a special @entity51 draw will guarantee 18 new millionaires in the @entity53 tomorrow			0

' this draw will be a special night for 18 lucky ticket - holders , who will all become a millionaire overnight			1
' bucking the trend : @entity71 and @entity72 bought a reasonably priced tent of course someone always bucks the trend and recent @entity77 jackpot lottery millionaires @entity71 and @entity72 invested in a £ 39.99 tent so they could camp in style at @entity81			2
