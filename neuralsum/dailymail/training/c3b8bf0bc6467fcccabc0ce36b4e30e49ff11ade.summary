a cash - strapped council gives £ 12,000 of taxpayers ' money a year to its chairwoman and vice chairwoman so they can spend the cash on clothes			1
@entity8 has refused to axe the perk despite critics saying the money would be better spent on vital services			1
the row over the allowance comes as the @entity16 - controlled authority is making more than £ 200m in cuts by 2018 and getting rid of 1,600 jobs			1
expensive taste : @entity8 chairwoman @entity20 who receives a clothing allowance of £ 8,580 from the cash - strapped authority current chairwoman councillor @entity20 receives a £ 13,300 basic allowance paid to all councillors , a special responsibility allowance of £ 6,650 - and a clothing allowance of £ 8,580			1
the vice-chairwoman councillor @entity29 receives the basic allowance , a special responsibility allowance of £ 3,325 and a clothing allowance of £ 4,280			1
@entity33 , regional secretary of the @entity34 , said : ' everybody knows the financial pressures that councils are under and trade unions have encouraged councillors to take decisions that prioritise protecting services and jobs			0
' councillors need to take the lead by making sure that there are n't any unjustifiable allowances or other perks that they receive			0
in all her finery : chairwoman @entity20 pictured right last year during @entity53 's visit to @entity54 ' @entity8 workers and tax payers will look at this and find it a bit unnecessary			1
' councillor @entity60 , a @entity60 councillor representing @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ' you can find a reasonably priced suit for a man or woman for about £ 100			1
' so the £ 12,000 plus that is paid to councillors @entity67 and @entity68 would pay for the equivalent of 120 suits			1
we should scrap this waste			0
' @entity16 are fleecing @entity62 residents and opposition councillors and we have had enough of them trying to pull the wool over our eyes			0
' @entity8 has refused to axe the perk despite critics saying the money would be better spent on vital services deputy leader @entity83 , the council 's cabinet portfolio holder for resources , said the allowance had been in place for nearly 30 years			1

' he said the chairwoman had very important civic responsibilities and was bound to incur ' significant expenses '			0
according to mr @entity83 , workload had increased significantly since the council became a unitary authority in 2009			0
however , @entity60 , the council 's @entity60 leader , said money saved by axing the clothing allowance could used to part - fund the county 's @entity101 which is having its funding contributions cut			2
he said : ' we do n't believe there should be an enormous allowance like this for clothing			2
' £ 8,580 , let alone £ 12,000 , is more than a pensioner gets to live on during the course of a year			1
' taxpayer @entity67 , who lives in @entity111 , @entity62 , said : ' i think this is a ludicrous amount for clothing and something should be done about it			0
' councillor @entity67 , who represents @entity116 for @entity16 , did not respond to calls to her @entity119 office			2
the councillor , who lives in @entity122 , near @entity123 , was previously vice-chairwoman and took over the post in april last year			2
