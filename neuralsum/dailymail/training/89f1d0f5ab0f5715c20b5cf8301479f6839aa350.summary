by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 5 july 2013 mothers having trouble breastfeeding may be showing the early signs of diabetes , doctors have warned			1
new research has revealed the hormone insulin plays an important part in the production of breast milk - and mothers who are struggling with feeding may have low levels of insulin			1
for a long time , insulin was not thought to play a direct role in regulating the milk - making cells of the human breast			2
but scientists now know that the mammary gland in breast becomes sensitive to insulin during lactation			0
new research has revealed that insulin plays an important part in the production of milk			1

but scientists now know that the mammary gland becomes sensitive to insulin during lactation a clinical trial is now planned with a drug used to control type 2 diabetes to determine whether it improves milk supply - and the researchers suggest that women struggling to breastfeed should perhaps get their insulin levels checked			1
insulin levels are linked to diabetes			0
in people with type 1 diabetes , beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed , meaning that the body can no longer produce insulin			1
people with type 2 diabetes make insulin , but their bodies do n’t respond well to it			2
some people with type 2 diabetes may take pills or insulin shots to help their bodies use glucose for energy			2
previous research from dr @entity63 , the study author , have shown it takes longer for milk to come in to women whose bodies struggle to metabolise enough insulin			2
dr @entity63 explored the connection between milk production and insulin levels , ( an insulin pen is pictured ) those who tend to struggle often have factors involved such as being overweight , being at an advanced maternal age , or having a large birth - weight baby			0
dr @entity63 and her colleagues were able to use a non-invasive method to capture mammary gland rna - a chain of molecules that are blueprints for making specified proteins - in samples of human breast milk			0
they then created the first publicly accessible library of genes expressed in the mammary gland based on rna - sequencing technology			0
they discovered an orchestrated switching on and off of various genes as the mammary gland transitions from secreting small amounts of immunity - boosting colostrum in the first days after giving birth to the copious production of milk in mature lactation			0
having identified the significance of insulin signalling in the production of breast - milk , the scientists at @entity103 and the @entity104 , are now planning a clinical trial with a drug used to control type two diabetes to determine whether it improves insulin action in the mammary gland , thus improving milk supply			1
dr @entity63 said : ' considering that 20 per cent of women between 20 and 44 are pre-diabetic , it ’s conceivable that up to 20 per cent of new mothers in the @entity121 are at risk for low milk supply due to insulin dysregulation [ i.e. low levels ] , ' she said			1
while a drug is not an ideal way to solve the problem according to dr @entity63 , it is a way to establish proof - of - concept			0
' the ideal approach is a preventive one , ' she said			0
' modifications in diet and exercise are more powerful than any drug			0
after this clinical trial , we hope to study those interventions			1
' a clinical trial is planned with a drug used to control type two diabetes to determine whether it improves milk supply			1

new research suggests insulin does more than facilitate *uptake* of sugars
@entity121 scientists think believe up to 20 *%* of new mothers could be at risk of low milk supply due to the body not using insulin as it should
a clinical trial is planned with a drug used to control type two diabetes to determine whether it improves milk supply
