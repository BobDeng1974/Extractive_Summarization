click here to see more of our brilliant @entity1 , including @entity4 's heat map yes , it was him again			1
@entity4 , given a shot at redemption by @entity9 after his shirt - swapping shame against @entity11 , was booked for using an elbow and then missed an injury - time sitter as @entity16 ’s @entity15 problems in front of goal continued			1
both managers offered encouraging words for @entity4 afterwards , citing his willingness and work - rate , but that is surely the bare minimum for a £ 16million striker			1
he will know deep down it was another disastrous day at the office , one of a growing number since he swapped the @entity30 for @entity31			2
@entity15 also had his share of controversial moments but at least he banged in the goals , 31 in the @entity36 last season			2
@entity4 is still looking for his first league goal and @entity16 are suffering as a result , particularly with @entity39 injured			1
@entity4 missed a gilt - edged chance with the last kick of the game for @entity16 at @entity31 on saturday @entity4 's afternoon for @entity16 was torrid once more , culminating in a three - yard miss with the final kick of the game the @entity47 smirks as referee @entity48 brandishes him a yellow card following a foul on @entity52 's @entity51 @entity16 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6.5 , @entity56 6.5 , @entity57 5 ; @entity58 ( @entity59 61 , 5 ) , @entity60 6.5 , can 6 ( @entity61 75 , 4 ) ; @entity62 6 , @entity4 6 , @entity63 5 ( @entity64 61 , 5.5 ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 booked : @entity62 55 , @entity4 57 , @entity61 81 @entity52 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity70 7 ; @entity71 6 , @entity51 6.5 , @entity72 6 ; @entity73 6 , @entity74 6 , @entity75 8 ( @entity76 87 ) , @entity77 6 , @entity78 6 ; @entity79 6 ( @entity80 71 , 5.5 ) , @entity81 5 ( @entity82 71 , 5 ) subs not used : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 booked : @entity74 40 , @entity79 50 referee : @entity48 attendance : 44,591 * ratings by @entity91 at @entity31 you could n’t stop them scoring last season			1
this time around , they have netted only five times at @entity31 in five league games and they wo n’t be returning to the @entity98 if it continues			0
@entity9 tried to show faith in the @entity47 who was fined for swapping shirts with @entity102 when @entity16 were 3 - 0 down at half - time on wednesday night			1
the 24 - year - old was applauded every time he closed down a @entity52 defender but that ’s not meant to be the sum total of a world - class striker			1
in the second half , he led with an elbow as he challenged @entity52 ’s @entity51 , son of their manager @entity111 , for a header on the halfway line and caught him in the face			1
naively , he then checked his own elbow for any damage			0
@entity48 gave @entity4 a yellow card because he did n’t think it was intentional but other referees would not have been as lenient			1
manager @entity51 , to his credit , did n’t want to be part of a witch - hunt afterwards			1
‘ from where i was looking , they were both going for the ball , ’ he said			0
‘ i thought @entity4 was their most effective player			1
he is a character , a maverick			0
and you have to treat him as such			0
’ @entity9 will have been more concerned that his supposed chief goal threat , having had an early shot saved by @entity52 ’s third - choice goalkeeper @entity70 , fluffed his lines right at the end			1
substitute @entity59 found him six yards from goal but the striker , lacking confidence , allowed the ball to run past him without getting a touch			0
any contact would have resulted in a goal			0
‘ it was a big chance , ’ admitted @entity9			1
‘ he had a couple of them in the game			2
with that one , it was a great run by @entity59 and i think he just opened up his foot to try and get it in , and it ’s run across			0
‘ at the moment he is doing his best , unfortunately he is maybe missing that little bit of confidence			0
he kept getting into the areas , but goalscorers get their energy by seeing the ball hit the back of the net			0
’ @entity51 picked a 3 - 5 - 2 formation and , although @entity73 headed off the line from @entity56 and @entity70 denied @entity4 from @entity62 ’s pass , @entity52 were the better team in the first half			1
click here to see more of our brilliant @entity1 - above is @entity16 striker @entity4 's heat map @entity74 was booked in the first half for this studs - up challenge on @entity16 's @entity164 can winces in pain after @entity74 's challenge ... the @entity52 midfielder received a yellow card , but it perhaps should have been more @entity170 miles @entity16 109.1 67.8 @entity62 90 10.7 6.6 @entity60 90 10.6 6.6 @entity54 90 10.5 6.5 @entity52 106.6 66.2 @entity171 90 11.9 7.4 @entity74 90 10.6 6.6 @entity78 90 9.8 6.1 @entity171 had a shot saved by @entity53 and then @entity74 was unlucky to see a 25 - yard drive deflected wide			1
the energetic @entity174 was their stand - out performer			2
@entity74 was also booked for a late challenge on @entity178 that set the tone for a tetchy second period			1
@entity79 barged into @entity60 and got booked			2
a frustrated @entity62 caught @entity78 on the shin with a high foot			0
then , most controversially , @entity4 left @entity51 poleaxed			2
he was looking at the ball rather than the player but it must have been painful			0
the pair clashed again later , leaving @entity48 to urge @entity4 , who had four red cards in his @entity189 career , to calm down			2
when the @entity47 fell looking for a penalty after @entity51 ’s challenge late on , it was a desperate attempt to claim a penalty			0
@entity9 sent on @entity64 and @entity59 for the last half - hour and @entity16 gradually gained control and created chances			1
@entity70 was kept fairly busy but as @entity51 pointed out : ‘ he did n’t have to make any saves i would n’t have expected him to			0
’ @entity61 , another sub , incurred @entity75 ’s wrath after going over too easily and at the death @entity4 was unable to write his own fairytale ending , appearing to lose focus as @entity59 ’s cross fell to him			2
his only @entity16 goal remains against @entity204 ’s @entity203 in the @entity98			2
@entity9 is playing a shrewd game with @entity4			1
he will give him chances to turn things around but if it ’s not happened for him by january , do n’t be surprised to see @entity4 being asked to wave ‘ arrivederci ’			2
for now , he ’s not going to throw @entity4 to the dogs			2
‘ i have only been working with him for a short period of a time			0
from what i can gauge on the training field , i do n’t think there is any danger of him losing faith			0
some players might have a day when they do n’t train when things are n’t going well			0
but he is in every day , wanting to improve , wanting to get better			0
‘ it is not quite happening for him in terms of the ball hitting the back of the net but he knows he needs to run and press here			0
the reaction from the team after @entity11 was good			0
’ the @entity16 manager was correct in asserting that at least his players did n’t buckle again after being taught a lesson by @entity11 in midweek			1
then again , they were up against @entity171 and @entity78 on saturday , not @entity230			0
@entity4 makes a mark on the game , and also on @entity234 's face , as he attempts to reach the ball with an outstretched boot @entity4 evades the challenge of @entity171 ( right ) and @entity71 ( centre ) during the first half at @entity31 on saturday afternoon @entity9 shouts instructions at his @entity16 side , as @entity4 looks on from the side of the pitch can breaks away from @entity174 during @entity16 's @entity36 match against @entity52 at @entity31 @entity60 speaks to team - mate @entity4 before taking a free - kick during the @entity36 match at @entity31 can swings and misses at the ball during @entity16 's @entity36 match against @entity52 at @entity31 @entity16 midfielder @entity61 winces in pain , but is booked for diving after a challenge with @entity52 's @entity75 @entity58 runs through the @entity52 midfield , beating the challenge of @entity75 while @entity79 ( right ) watches on @entity256 ( right ) , manager of @entity52 , shouts instructions at his team , while @entity9 looks on in the background @entity63 is bundled over by @entity71 during the first half of saturday 's game at @entity31 @entity4 reacts after taking a knock during @entity16 's @entity36 match against @entity52 @entity16 supporters protested before the match with a series of banners against the current ticket prices at their club ' enough is enough ' , read another banner unfurled by the @entity16 support in the build - up to the match another banner said ' supporters not customers ' ... a steward can be seen trying to remove the sign from the stadium			1

@entity4 started , despite receiving *criticism* from manager @entity9 earlier in the week
@entity74 was booked for a studs - up challenge on @entity178 , but was lucky not to have been sent off
@entity52 have had an *impressive* start to the season , and move up to ninth - @entity16 are down to sixth
@entity4 endured another *disappointing* day , culminating in a last - minute miss with the final kick of the game
