@entity0 crossed his hands and looked to the heavens as a tearful @entity3 – injured on his first league start in 32 months - made his way down the tunnel holding the same knee which has caused him two years of pain			1
the @entity10 boss will have to wait and see if his prayers are answered on that front			1
but at least the divine and devastating intervention of @entity14 ensured a fifth win on the spin in the @entity17 , lifting them , albeit briefly , to fourth in the table			1
to give their ascent some context , the @entity20 were in the relegation zone just five weeks ago			0
@entity0 , though , admitted that the victory was marred by the injury to @entity3 , who was making his @entity27 comeback after successive cruciate - ligament injuries			1
‘ fortunately , his surgeon was here from @entity112 and he went to hospital with him for a scan			0
‘ so the win was tinged with sadness			2
@entity3 is a person who does not deserve the trauma he ’s had already , let alone another trauma			1
fingers crossed he ’s okay			0
’ @entity0 added : ‘ when you ’re a manager you live through some of that pain and we 've had many chats trying to keep his spirits up			0
‘ i do n’t want to go down that line with him again			0
i want him to come in and say “ it was a bit of a scare , i ’m okay			0
” ’ @entity14 ’s brilliant winner came 12 minutes from time , forging his way into the penalty area before swapping passes with @entity75 and hooking beyond @entity36 , who had repelled all thrown at him to that point			1
the @entity52 international was skippering the side in the absence of @entity141 and was the game ’s stand - out player			2
‘ @entity14 was the best player on the pitch by some distance , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we had a long discussion about the captaincy and i wanted to make sure it did not knock him out of kilt			0
sometimes it can take your mind off the game			2
‘ but he grew with the armband			0
it was a wonderful goal			0
’ @entity156 , meanwhile , saw his side remain bottom of the table after a sixth straight loss on the road			2
the @entity162 were without pacey frontman @entity163 , and that , says the manager , cost them dear			0
@entity69 goes flying after a strong challenge from @entity50 defender @entity41 as @entity10 win 1 - 0 @entity67 ( right ) eases @entity50 striker @entity166 ( centre ) off the ball as he tries to burst through the @entity10 defence @entity60 ( centre ) crosses the ball as he returned to @entity27 for the first time since leaving @entity10 three years ago @entity166 , who had netted six times in the @entity17 prior to the match , unleashes a strike that flashes wide of @entity65 's goal former @entity10 midfielder @entity60 applauds the @entity27 crowd as he heads down the tunnel after the match @entity181 miles @entity10 109.6 68.1 @entity66 90 11.0 6.8 @entity72 90 10.9 6.8 @entity75 90 10.6 6.6 @entity50 105.7 65.7 @entity60 90 11.6 7.2 @entity182 90 10.2 6.4 @entity94 90 10.1 6.3 ‘ when you play away from home you need pace on the break , and we ’re not blessed with that , ’ he said			1
‘ we missed @entity163 , he ’s done very well			0
he wanted to be with his wife who was having a baby , and that ’s fair enough			0
’ @entity0 ’s side , though , had deserved the maximum return			0
it was @entity3 who dictated the tempo from the centre of the park early on			1
one cleverly - crafted corner saw @entity73 locate @entity3 lurking unmarked on the fringe of the area			1
he used one touch to cushion and the next to draw a palmed save from @entity36			0
@entity73 – enjoying his first home start since september – was again the architect behind @entity3 ’s next chance – a measured curler from 20 yards – but again @entity36 kept it goalless			1
@entity3 then took aim with a free - kick from range – slamming it into the wall – before succumbing to injury			1
@entity27 ’ – like @entity0 – looked to the sky in hope when the 30 - year - old plonked himself on the turf and signalled to the bench that he had a problem			1
but the look on @entity3 ’s face told its own story and he received a standing ovation as he limped from the field			2
the second period did not come to life until just before the hour mark when @entity14 set off on a galloping run from deep inside his own half			2
covering fully 50 yards unopposed , he slid @entity76 through on goal but again it was @entity36 who proved @entity231 ’s nemesis			0
it was always going to take an individual effort to break the deadlock and that moment arrived courtesy of @entity14			2
home thoughts , however , very quickly turned to @entity3			2
@entity61 ( centre ) remonstrates with referee @entity103 as a @entity10 player lays stricken on the ground @entity241 stretches to reach the ball as it goes out of play as @entity86 chases him down @entity60 ( far left ) appeals as @entity88 ( far right ) tussles with @entity69 ( second right ) and @entity75 @entity50 manager @entity156 ( right ) barks instructions at his players from the touchline during his side 's 1 - 0 defeat @entity36 ( left ) jumps to collect the ball under pressure as @entity75 bears down on the @entity50 goalkeeper @entity10 's @entity72 jumps with @entity94 as the pair contest a header during the game at @entity27			1

@entity10 edged out *opponents* @entity50 in a close encounter at @entity27 on saturday
@entity14 scored with 12 minutes left on the clock to secure a fifth straight @entity17 win
@entity3 , starting his first league game for almost three years , was forced off with injury after 33 minutes
