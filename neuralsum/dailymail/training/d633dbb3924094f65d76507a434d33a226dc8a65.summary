the rape of the unidentified 32 - year - old @entity16 last friday has resulted in scores of police searching the island where the incident occurred in the hope of finding the offenders in the untamed jungles			1
over the years there have been numerous accounts of ' witch killings ' , with the victims in many cases being attacked with bush knives and their bodies burned in @entity6 her ordeal was yet another example of the violence women experience in the country lying to the north of @entity39 - particularly any suspected of practising sorcery to bring about the death of someone			1

in the early hours of june 26 , 2010 , @entity46 and the two who are still at large went to miss @entity63 's home and held the family hostage with home - made guns			1
then they set about attacking miss @entity71 with machetes and an axe , striking her on an arm , neck and head			1
miss @entity63 's family told the court how they watched helplessly as the ferocious attack took place			1
they could only watch , they said , as ' her blood splattered across the floor before she collapsed and died '			0

a spokeswoman for women 's groups , miss @entity113 , told the paper that the court decision to send @entity46 to jail for 30 years was ' good and encouraged women to stop accepting compensation and should instead take these matters to court			1
' referring to the kinds of payments that were made to compensate for murders , miss @entity113 said : ' we do n't want compensation payments for our sister 's death - we have pigs , we have money			1
' no compensation can bring our sister back to life			0
' the judge said that in his view some people were using sorcery as an excuse to terminate someone 's life though the suspect may not be a sorcerer			2
