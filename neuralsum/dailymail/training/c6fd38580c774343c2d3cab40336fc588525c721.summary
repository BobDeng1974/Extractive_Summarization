@entity0 was one of the most influential women of the 20th century : a distinguished fossil expert , brilliant academic and pioneer of birth control			1
also a feminist visionary , she opened the first birth control clinic in @entity7 and her book , @entity9 — which argued marriage should be an equal relationship between husband and wife — was an international bestseller			1
and yet , in her private life , she was a staggeringly selfish monster			1
selfish monster : @entity18 treated her son @entity19 like a social experiment she was anti-semitic and believed fervently in eugenics — or “ improving ” the human population through selective breeding			1
though she made her name as a marital expert she publicly humiliated her two husbands			0
the greatest irony of all though , was that the woman who wrote another bestseller , @entity28 was an atrocious mother			2
she treated her only son as a social experiment , dressing him up in girl ’s clothes , choosing , and then discarding , adoptive brothers for him , and later cruelly victimising his wife			1
when @entity0 died in 1958 , at the age of 77 , her son found she had cut him out of much of her will , she had remained so angry at his marriage			1
that son , dr @entity41 has just died aged 90			2
remarkably , not only did he survive his mother ’s wicked treatment , but he flourished as a philosopher and remained happily married to his own wife for nearly 70 years			1
he even defended his mother against riticism and censure			1
his willingness to forgive his horrific parent is all the more extraordinary when you consider the misery of his childhood			0
wicked treatment : @entity19 's willingness to forgive his horrific parent is extraordinary when you consider the misery of his childhood @entity0 did n’t allow him to read books when younger , because she thought they stopped children thinking for themselves			1
until the age of 11 , he was forced to wear skirts as his mother took against trousers , which she considered ‘ ugly and heating - in - the - wrong - places garments ’			1
bicycles — thought equally wicked by her — were also banned			1
honoured : @entity66 in @entity67 when @entity41 was born in 1924 , his mother was 43 and world famous			2
her father was a prosperous brewer , her mother a @entity74 scholar , and she was brought up in an intellectual hothouse			2
the first female academic at the @entity77 , she became an expert on fossils before turning her mind to birth control			1
her 1918 book , @entity9 , sold 750,000 copies and made her a household name			0
her mothers ’ @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity67 , opened in 1921 and was the first in the country to offer birth control advice			1
over the next 22 years , more opened nationwide			0
during her lifetime , none offered terminations			0
an anti-abortionist , @entity0 argued that preventing pregnancy through birth control was the way forward			1
but , as her professional career flourished , her private life was torn apart by her raging megalomania and a belief she was some sort of divine messiah			1
when she addressed a conference of @entity115 bishops , she greeted them with : ‘ @entity116 , i speak to you in the name of @entity108			0
i speak to you of the mysteries of man and woman			0
’ her first marriage to @entity118 , a @entity119 geneticist , was a disaster			0
after marrying in 1911 , @entity0 filed for divorce just two years later on the grounds that the marriage was never consummated			1
gates ’ sexual failure became widely - known — a shameful humiliation for the distinguished scientist			0
banished : @entity0 heartbreakingly stopped her second husband @entity128 from seeing their son her second marriage in 1918 to @entity128 , a rich philanthropist and @entity132 flying ace , was n’t much more successful			1
though they had a son together she soon grew bored by @entity41 as a lover and companion			2
she forced him to write a letter — which she dictated — freeing her from their marriage vows			2
though they did not divorce , she banished @entity143 to the attic of their 18th - century mansion , only letting him enter family rooms if he had first completed chores			2
the separation from his son caused @entity143 anguish			2
‘ i hope you will allow me to see @entity19 sometimes , ’ was his heartbreaking plea to his wife			1
she became obsessed with her only child and set out to control him to a horrifying degree			2
too old to have any more children and worried @entity19 would be lonely and anti-social without a sibling , @entity0 advertised for an adopted brother , who had to be ‘ absolutely healthy , intelligent and not circumcised ’			1
the first candidate , @entity161 , was a three - year - old orphan , reluctantly handed over by loving , but poor , aunts			0
two years later , they took him back , horrified , when @entity0 said their nephew would be improved by ‘ a few whippings ’			1
then came @entity167 , who was sent back to the @entity168 because he would ‘ never bloom so as to be a credit to us ’			0
the third adopted brother , @entity171 , was rejected because he lacked ‘ academic ability and literary and artistic sensibility ’			0
@entity174 , the fourth , was renamed @entity176 because she did n’t like his original name			0
when he wet himself — one can imagine through sheer terror and distress — she declared he was ‘ unfit to live in a decent household ’			0
lonely childhood : @entity0 became obsessed with her only child and set out to control him to a horrifying degree in this desperate , lonely childhood , one of @entity19 ’s few consolations was his family ’s friendship with @entity190 , the illustrator of @entity191			1
@entity190 once sent a deeply poignant letter to the little boy , with a sketch of @entity195 crying at the prospect of not making his birthday party			0
@entity190 wrote , ‘ @entity198 [ @entity19 ’s nickname ]			1
i am very sory that i cant come to yr party but i am going away to the igsle of wite on saturday 24nd and i am verry verry sory			0
’ in spite of everything , @entity19 flourished			2
after @entity208 school , he read physics at @entity210 , then gained a phd in philosophy at @entity213 , and embarked on an academic career			0
but it proved impossible to escape his mother ’s bullying			2
she was determined to decide who her son would marry , someone who would be ‘ his peer in looks , inheritance and health ’			0
admirer of @entity227 : @entity0 sent a copy of a collection of her poems , @entity231 , to @entity227 when @entity19 fell for childhood friend @entity233 , daughter of sir @entity234 , inventor of the bouncing bomb , his mother reacted with fury			1
@entity233 was short - sighted — a sign of terrible genetic weakness , according to @entity0 ’s unpalatable eugenicist views			1
she wrote : ‘ @entity233 and @entity19 are quite callous about both the wrong to their children , the wrong to my family , and the eugenic crime			2
’ @entity0 was a fellow of the @entity246 and , in 1921 , founded the @entity247 and @entity248			2
its aim was to promote eugenic birth control			1
she backed ‘ the sterilisation of those totally unfit for parenthood [ including ] the inferior , the depraved , and the feeble - minded ’			0
she believed , too , in the idea of ‘ racial degeneration ’ , caused by sexually - transmitted diseases and ‘ overcrowding ’			0
she refused to have a @entity260 refugee child to lunch during @entity262 , saying it would offend guests			0
in 1942 , she wrote a poem which said : ‘ @entity270 , @entity267 / the jews and the @entity269 / all are a curse / or something worse			0
’ she even sent a copy of a collection of her poems , @entity276 , to @entity227 , whom she greatly admired			1
she wrote : ‘ @entity227 , @entity277 is the greatest thing in the world : so will you accept from me these [ poems ] that you may allow the young people of your nation to have them ? ‘ the young must learn love from the particular till they are wise enough for the universal			1
i hope too that you yourself may find something to enjoy in the book			0
’ so incensed was she by her daughter - in - law ’s supposed genetic weakness , that she refused to attend the wedding			0
and , when @entity0 died of breast cancer a decade later , she cut @entity19 out of her will almost entirely because she believed ‘ he had betrayed her by this marriage ’			1
she bequeathed @entity19 13 volumes of the @entity298 and a @entity300 cottage , while her large fortune went to the @entity246 and @entity302			2
wickedly selfish : when @entity0 died of breast cancer she cut @entity19 out of her will almost entirely and yet throughout his life he continued to defend his mother and the contribution she made to sex education and the welfare of the poor			1
he even said he was now ‘ prepared to laugh ’ at the way he had been brought up			0
meanwhile , his own career prospered			0
after @entity312 , he became a lecturer at @entity314 and later rose to become vice-president of the @entity316			0
his marriage to @entity233 , a fellow academic , was a deeply happy one			0
together they had four children and when their two boys and two girls were young they would all holiday together in @entity323			0
he set out to create his own ideal of ‘ @entity9 ’ and endeavoured to right with his own children all the appalling wrongs of his own wickedly selfish mother .			0

@entity0 was anti-semitic , believed in eugenics and sent @entity227 love poems
she treated her only son @entity19 as a social experiment , dressing him up in girl ’s clothes , discarding his adoptive brothers and victimising his wife
forced her husband to live in the attic and banned him from seeing @entity19
despite success opening the first birth control clinic , her private life was torn apart by her raging megalomania and belief she was a divine messiah
remarkably @entity19 survived her wicked treatment and defended his mother
