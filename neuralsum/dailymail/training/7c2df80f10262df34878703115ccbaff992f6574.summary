by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 05:16 est , 17 january 2013 a @entity2 scientist says he has discovered a female chimpanzee who is addicted to watching porn			2
@entity5 , a resident of @entity6 , chose to solely watch adult entertainment channels when a television and remote control was placed in her enclosure			1
primatologist @entity12 , writing in @entity2 newspaper @entity11 at the weekend , told how he made the discovery some years ago on a tour of the nation 's chimpanzee enclosures			2
porn addict : @entity5 the chimpanzee ( not pictured ) favoured the adult channels on her tv over all others			1
stock image during his research trip , dubbed the ' chimpatour ' , he conducted surveys on the behaviour of the animals			0
' what i could never imagine were the surprises prepared for me by a female of this species called @entity5 who lived in @entity6 , ' he said			1
her enclosure , he said , consisted of an outdoor area where she could play and a heated interior zone where she could protect herself from the winter cold and extreme summer heat			2
' due to the intense interior lives that these animals have , you have to enrich their environment to stimulate them physically and psychologically , ' he wrote			0
' these usually consist of artificial mounds , toys and other inventions that require them to be active and sharpen their wits			0
it is the equivalent of occupational therapy for humans			0
' chimpanzees and their close evolutionary relatives bonobos are the closest cousins to humans in the animal kingdom			0
bonobos in particular are known for their aggressive sexual behaviour , but no - one could predict how @entity5 the chimp would respond to a television with access to adult channels			1
professor @entity12 said : ' to enliven @entity5 's nights , officials decided to install a television , protected behind glass , and gave her a remote control so she could change the channels herself			1
' in the early trials , her keepers visited @entity5 to check that everything was in order and she did not break the new toy			1
' the surprise came when they found that within a few days , @entity5 was not only using the remote control perfectly well , but that she also chose the porn channel for entertainment , as many of us would have done			1
' professor @entity12 said that easy access to those kind on images on television was ' a very recent phenomenon in human sexual history '			0
he added : ' although a small study estimated that porn films are only watched for about 12 minutes on average , the truth is that human and non-human primates possess an intense sexual life			0
' this is probably the result of an infinite capacity to dream and recreate the situation in the mind , as evidenced by the games , innovations and manipulations that we are capable of in other areas of our lives			0
