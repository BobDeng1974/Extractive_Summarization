for @entity2 , the first half of this season turned out much like last			1
a strong start , some raw talent unearthed by shrewd dealing in the transfer market ; followed by a slump that has seen them fall away from automatic promotion contenders to play - off outsiders			1
in fact , @entity12 ’s side are far closer to the @entity15 drop zone in terms of points than they are the top two – 16 off second - placed @entity19 yet only eight clear of @entity20 in 21st			2
@entity2 made a strong start to the season but have fallen out of the @entity15 play - off places the damning statistics go on			1
following sunday ’s 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity27 , @entity2 have won just once in their last 10 league games			1
now , while you ’d be a brave man to tip @entity2 to go down , chairman @entity32 knows the club must arrest this slide quickly			1
they can not afford to stagnate			0
on monday , he announced on @entity38 that he would be conducting a full review in to 2014 as we head in to the new year			1
@entity2 chairman @entity41 ( left ) has announced he will be conducting a full review in to 2014 in all competitions , @entity2 played 57 games this year , winning 22 and losing 25			1
that is not good enough for a club wanting @entity48 football			0
but they have no divine right			0
@entity51 and @entity52 are both in their fourth consecutive seasons in the third tier			0
as they will both testify , the longer you stay down , the harder it is to get back up			0
there was a sprinkling of quality added to @entity12 ’s side over the summer , not least with the addition of winger @entity63 from @entity64 , but it has not been enough to account for the loss of @entity66			0
@entity63 , signed from @entity64 this summer , celebrates scoring against @entity67 in september @entity68 have missed the goals of @entity66 who left the club for the @entity48 in august @entity2 made a £ 4million profit in just over a year on the 22 - year - old striker			1
selling him to @entity75 for £ 5.5m in august represented a fantastic piece of business for a @entity15 club			0
when mulling over that offer , @entity79 will have cast his mind back to the summer before when @entity2 sold top scorer @entity82 to @entity83 and managed to replace him with @entity84 , spending less than a quarter of the fee received for @entity82			1
but , despite all showing flashes of promise , young strikers @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 have not hit anywhere the heights of @entity84 , or of @entity82 before him			0
and @entity84 ’s 23 goals could only take @entity2 to a play - off semi-final in may			1
selling @entity84 to @entity75 for £ 5.5m represented fantastic business for a @entity15 club @entity12 will no doubt want more money to spend in january and will perhaps expect it given the three promotions he has earned at the club in two spells and the money earned from selling @entity84			0
but the fact of the matter is that at least six of the nine sides above @entity2 in the @entity15 table heading in to 2015 went in to the season with lower expectations and are working on tighter budgets			1
@entity12 needs to get the best out of what he ’s got already and with nearly two weeks until their next match while that review of 2014 takes places , the training field is where he has to find the answers			1
he has tinkered plenty with formations and players over the course of the year with frustrating consequences for the @entity2 faithful			2
@entity12 needs to settle on a team and show his managerial credentials , because @entity2 ca n’t afford another year like this one			2
@entity82 signed for @entity128 side @entity83 from @entity2 in the summer of 2013 good @entity129 for … @entity130 a maximum six points from two games has seen the @entity134 side leap up in to the @entity136 play - offs			1
sunday ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity138 was followed a 2 - 0 home defeat of plymouth - results which see @entity142 ’s side enter 2015 in fifth place and just three points off the automatic promotion places			2
@entity129 for … @entity146 while the likes of @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 have been upwardly mobile in the bottom half of the @entity48 in recent weeks , @entity148 ’s side have been sinking like stone			0
a 6 - 1 drubbing at @entity156 on @entity157 was followed by a 2 - 0 home defeat by league leaders @entity160 on sunday			2
with the resources available to @entity163 and @entity164 beneath them , the @entity161 are now second - favourites for the drop behind stranded @entity166			0
@entity148 's @entity146 lost to @entity156 on @entity157 before going down 2 - 0 to league leaders @entity160 talent scout : @entity168 ( @entity169 ) after making his debut for @entity171 aged 17 , @entity134 striker @entity168 has long been tipped for big things and now , aged 22 , he is really beginning to fulfil his promise			2
three goals in two games over the festive season have seen @entity168 takes his tally for the season to 12 in just 15 @entity15 appearances			0
a summer move to @entity169 has kickstarted his career but @entity168 may not be at the club much longer if he keeps scoring at this rate			0
@entity169 's @entity168 has scored 12 goals in 15 @entity15 appearances for the @entity186 this season			0

@entity2 started strongly but have fallen out of the play - off places
the @entity2 have won just one of their the last 10 league encounters
chairman @entity41 is set to conduct a full review of 2014
