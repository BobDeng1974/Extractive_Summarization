by @entity0 you may be sick of the sight of look back videos posted all over @entity4 , but there is one that 's sure to raise a smile			2

the 59 - second clip shows the prince joining the social network in 2007 before being depicted at various events including the royal wedding in 2011 and his recent trip to @entity22			1
some of the pictures in the montage are real , while others have been doctored for comedy effect @entity4 launched its look back video tool earlier this week to celebrate its 10th birthday			1
the feature selects moments from a user ’s @entity4 history and edits them into a one - minute show reel , set to music			1
this video can then be shared on that person ’s timeline , which has caused many people to complain that their news feeds are littered with them			0

to remedy this , @entity4 said it would be launching edit feature ‘ soon ’ to let people change the photos and statuses used			2
prince @entity14 does n’t have an official @entity4 account , so writer and producer comedy duo @entity26 and @entity27 have imagined what it may look like			1
they used real photos , mixed with photos that have been doctored , including an image where a large pair of large ears has been superimposed onto a photo of @entity14 next to his brother @entity69			1
another shows his face placed on the body of someone wearing underwear over tracksuit bottoms			0
