the sudden death of @entity2 favourite @entity1 has led to claims horses are being pushed too hard to race			1
the @entity7 - owned horse collapsed in his stall and died just moments after crossing the finishing line in last place on tuesday			1
on wednesday , the results of an autopsy performed on @entity1 showed he had suffered from ' acute heart failure ' after crossing the finish line in last place			1
' that 's a value - based question			1
if you look at injury rates and bleeding in the lungs , you could argue that they are pushed beyond the extremes of what their body can withstand without injury , ' he said			2
dr @entity32 said racehorses go through ' massive changes ' in their cardiovascular system when they were racing because they were going from a gentle life in a paddock to training at high speeds			1
in a initial statement , racing @entity58 's chief veterinarian @entity57 said the horse had died from the rare ' sudden death syndrome ' , which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses			1
but there is debate over whether or not the syndrome actually exists			1
@entity33 veterinarian @entity32 told @entity65 on wednesday morning there was no such thing as the illness			1
when asked by one of the hosts of the breakfast show about it , dr @entity32 replied : ' sudden death syndrome is just sudden death			1
it does n't tell me what killed the horse			1
' the second horse to die after the @entity2 was @entity22			1
his death happened after he got spooked by a large flag , kicked a fence and broke his leg in what has been called a ' freak accident '			1
vets were later forced to euthanise him as the damage could not be repaired			0
dr @entity32 said depending on the severity of the break , a horse could not live comfortably on four legs because of its weight			1
he said the horse needed to have the functionality of all four legs for its own welfare			2
' the point is we have an animal of incredible weight , 500 kilos , standing on these finely built legs , ' dr @entity32 said			1
' you have to put plates and screws in and plaster casts on and hope they can stand			0
' @entity1 , which won the @entity111 in brilliant style in october , raced near the lead for most of the 3,200 - metre journey on tuesday			1
the @entity2 is the nation 's longest flat race where as the @entity117 is only 2,400 metres and the @entity118 is even less at 2,040 metres long			2
before the cup , some experts predicted that @entity1 would struggle to run the distance due to his heavy weight			1
the analysts forecast that the stallion , at 58.5kg , would find carrying his weight at a fast pace over the long distance problematic			0
no @entity2 runner weighing 58.5kg or more has won the race since 1975			0
leading up to the race , the @entity130 for the @entity131 plastered a graphic image of a horse laying down on its side asking race - goers ' is the party really worth it ? ' @entity139 , @entity7 owner of racehorse @entity1 , walks through the stables after the favourite died he had appeared emotional as he waited outside the stables , which were screened off with a green tent shocked : the team gather outside the stables where punters were told to move away by officials associate professor @entity150 - who heads the @entity154 's equine orthopaedic research - told @entity152 weight did not increase the risk of sudden death in horses			1
' the increase of sudden death depends on the age of the horse , the length of the race and the number of races the horse had competed in in the two months , ' he said			1
' certainly the longer the race , the greater the risk			0
we also know that the faster the horses are going the more stress it is putting on the horse			1
' associate professor @entity150 said research indicated that with every stride a horse took there was about four tonnes of load put on the joints			0
' the reason is because of the mechanics of the limbs , horses store a lot of energy in their tendons , ' he said			0
' any time those tendons are stretched ... extreme stress is put on the limbs and the heart – which beats at 230 beats per minute as soon as the horse starts galloping – so they 're pushing their biology to the limit when they 're going fast			0
' the deaths of the two horses have overshadowed the victory of @entity202 - trained @entity201 , who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades , and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses			1
jockey @entity19 ( in blue ) rides @entity1 on the way to the start of the @entity2 with no indication of the tragedy that was about to unfold @entity1 , the pre-race favourite , finished last in the @entity2 and almost walked across the line leading up the race , the @entity130 for the @entity131 plastered a graphic image of a horse laying down on its side on the @entity218 road near @entity219 in west @entity220 as part of their campaign , asking race - goers ' is the party really worth it ? ' and also posted the same image on their @entity229 page			1
the group is now hitting out at the use of whips by jockeys , which it says is pushing racehorses beyond their physical limits			1
' we believe that pushing horses beyond their physical limits through use of the whip , and racing horses while under - developed at two years of age are significant factors as to why horses break down on the racetrack , ' spokesman @entity236 said			1
' we 're calling on the racing industry to start running whip - free races and phase out two year - old racing			1
' dr @entity32 said there was no research that showed there would be a lower injury rate if horses under two years old were not used			1
the coalition for the @entity131 claims 125 horses died on @entity257 racetracks between august 1 last year and july 31 this year			1
' that is one horse being killed every 2.9 days , ' mr @entity236 said			1
after hearing of the horses ' deaths , foreign affairs minister @entity260 told @entity152 the incidents as ' very sad news ' on tuesday			0
' but racing is a dangerous sport and the jockeys and trainers take all the care that they can and i know that they set very high standards her and terrible accidents do happen , ' ms @entity260 said			0

i saw him walking [ in the stables circle ] after he had finished			0
i saw them putting a stick in his mouth - i do n't know why			2
' then after i left i heard he had died			0
it is so sudden - and very sad			2
' before @entity326 rode in last , winner @entity201 was the first @entity202 horse to gallop to victory at @entity220 , heading @entity279 and who shot @entity281 down the stretch of the 3,200 - metre course			1

' ' ( it was a ) strong pace			0
he was able to sort of follow @entity341			0
and , you know , he has thrown him in			0
' obviously , it 's very special			0
you have to share it with the kids			0
because being away a lot			0
i need to win these races to make it worthwhile			0
' two chances were scratched prior to the race - @entity353 and @entity355 - reducing the final field to 22 horses			2

he just needed to have the right gap and he found it			0
' it 's a moment you wo n't forget in your life			2
it 's a big achievement for our team			0
thanks for the honour '			0
