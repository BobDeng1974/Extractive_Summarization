looking at @entity62 cpl. @entity186 's inner sanctum in @entity187 , @entity188 , there is no doubt that this greatest passion was football			0

in 2002 , he traveled to @entity3 to cover the looming war for the @entity211			0
but taking photographs for the newspaper left him unsatisfied because he felt that the public back home was disengaged from what was happening in the @entity217 country thousands of miles away			0

speaking to @entity248 , @entity11 said in the beginning it was tough to convince grieving parents to open their homes to a stranger and allow him into the private space of their son or daughter			2
‘ the job of parents when their child was alive to protect the child any way they could			0
when parents lose their child all they have is a memory and they turn to protecting that memory , ’ he said			0
‘ having someone come into the home and sharing that memory with the rest of the world is a huge leap of faith			0

private shrine : @entity11 said he made sure not to touch anything in the rooms so as not to disturb the peace of the fallen ; here pictured is the bedroom of @entity287 airman first class @entity285 , 21 , in @entity288 , @entity289 a different kid of tribute : @entity11 was inspired to create the book of photos because he wanted to show the real flesh - and - blood people behind the casualty count , among them @entity62 lt. @entity298 , 24 , from @entity299 , @entity188 ( room pictured ) passions and interests : @entity96			1
@entity303 , 19 , from @entity120 , @entity121 , was obviously a sci - fi and fantasy fan , as the posters on the walls would attest self - editing : @entity11 has learned from soldiers that they often tidy up their rooms before deployments to remove items they would not want their parents to find if they do not come back @entity11 said he has learned from his soldier friends that they often do some cleaning themselves before deployment , removing items they would not want their parents to find should they be killed			1
the photojournalist explained that the decision to photograph the rooms in black and white was inspired by his desire to make them seem as neutral as possible , thus allowing each soldier 's personality to shine through			2
fearing to disturb the peace of these hallowed spaces , @entity11 said he made a point of not touching anything inside - not even the light switches			2
' i felt i was in some historic memorial , ' he told the magazine .			0
