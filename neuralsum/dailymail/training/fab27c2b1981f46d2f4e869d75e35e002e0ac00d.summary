outrageous : @entity0 claims that the government was behind the @entity3 bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured the so - called ' nutty professor ' who said the @entity7 shooting never happened is now willing to concede some people , indeed , lost their lives in the tragedy			1
but @entity0 , a @entity11 tenured communications professor , is only seemingly willing to meet his many detractors half - way in their demands for outright contrition			1
' there are certainly people that lost their loved ones , there is no doubt of that , ' @entity0 tells @entity23 in @entity24			1
' if a similar tragedy were visited upon me and my family , i would be beside myself , ' he reportedly said			0
' but i think one of my ways of healing would be attempting to find out what went wrong , where was the failure			0
' the 47 - year - old professor suggested on his blog - memoryholeblog.com - the massacre at the least did not unfold in the way authorities said it did , and may not have happened at all			0
' while it sounds like an outrageous claim , one is left to inquire whether the @entity7 shooting ever took place — at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the nation ’s news media have described , ' he wrote			1
outrages : @entity47 ( center ) , the town selectman for @entity7 , says that professor @entity0 should be fired for his outlandish and insensitive claims @entity0 insinuated ' corporate media ' institutions , as well as government authorities , spun official accounts of the massacre that left 26 dead , including 20 children , to drive a preconceived agenda of gun control in @entity58			1
' as documents relating to the @entity7 shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends , ' he wrote on his blog			1
@entity0 has seemingly based his allegations largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports released during the hectic day			2
shut down : @entity7 is now closed , seen here on january 3 , but a professor in @entity76 argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed tragic : one of the points of professor @entity0 's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers however , as far as he 's concerned , the media is still the one to blame for not pushing authorities hard enough on the tough questions			1
in his @entity23 interview , @entity0 never apologizes for his prior remarks , but instead adds , ' the news media swooped into @entity7 very briefly to cover the tragedy in a very vampiric sort of way , then swooped back out again without giving us any real answers			1
' then , they immediately went into the grieving mode			0
i 'm not saying there 's not a place for that			0
but if we want to actually pay homage to the events , we want to find out what actually went wrong			0
that 's the greatest honor we can give them			0
' the professor also responded to calls for his immediate termination , saying : ' i am sure ( @entity11 is ) receiving emails that are emotionally driven , but i would think if @entity11 wishes to revoke my tenure and terminate me , that 's a blow against academics ' being able to speak their minds on the events of the day			1
' political ends : he argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns as with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies , this is far from his first foray into the world of the unproven			0
mr @entity0 has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars , economic overhauls and union negotiations			2
on his blog , however , he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy theories : the september 11 attacks , the purview of the @entity144 , the @entity145 , the death of @entity147 and @entity148 have all been topics of interest			0
even though he is paid to teach a class called @entity156 which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas , @entity11 appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far			2
' @entity0 does not speak for the university			2
the website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with @entity11 in any way			2
as for any previous disciplinary actions at @entity11 , we do not comment on personnel matters , ' school spokesman @entity166 said to the @entity170 .			0

@entity0 , a @entity11 professor , still thinks something 's fishy about official accounts of the @entity7 shooting
tells interviewer his ouster would represent a ' blow against academics ' everywhere
