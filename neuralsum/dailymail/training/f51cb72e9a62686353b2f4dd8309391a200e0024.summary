this is the historic speech the free world did not want to hear - and , thankfully , did n't			2
hastily scribbled on piece of paper , @entity3 supremo general @entity2 jotted down what he planned to say had @entity7 , which was 70 years ago tomorrow , been a disaster			1
the little - known document , known as ' in case of @entity11 ' , was quickly drafted by the commander of @entity13 in the event of the landings ending in bloody failure			1
the 66 - word script reveals the @entity19 general and @entity21 's prime minister @entity20 would have withdrawn the thousands of troops from the @entity24 beaches rather than let them fight to the death			1
this is the chilling speech @entity3 supremo general @entity2 planned to make had @entity7 turned into @entity28 , scribbled down on a note it also shows @entity2 , who went on to become president in 1953 , would have accepted the full blame for the unimaginable defeat at the hands of the @entity35			1
in the event , the @entity7 were a success and ultimately led to @entity38			0
@entity2 gave the note to his adjutant officer five weeks after @entity7 and it is has been held by the @entity41 for the last 30 years			1
a copy of it has now been published by the @entity21 military online archive @entity45 to mark the 70th anniversary of @entity7			0
@entity47 , of @entity45 , said : ' it is a very simple document but one that is very chilling given what was at stake			0
' while @entity13 went down in history as a success and gave the @entity3 a foothold in @entity57 , this piece of paper almost shows how easily it could have gone the other way			1
@entity2 , who later became president , and then @entity21 prime minister sir @entity20 would have withdrawn the thousands of troops from the @entity24 beaches rather than let them fight to the death ' the note certainly paints a picture of @entity2 , while confident of success on d - day , preparing for the worst case scenario as 150,000 men were preparing to land on the beaches			1
' had he had to use these notes on @entity7 it would have meant that there would have been thousands of @entity3 casualties lying on the beaches of @entity24			2
' it would have meant defeat for the @entity3 in the west and left @entity78 to focus all their efforts on the @entity81 on the @entity82 , giving the @entity83 a very different outcome			2
@entity2 , who became president in 1953 , would have carried the can if d - day in 1944 had been a failure ' it also would have ended @entity2 's career as @entity91 and probably the end @entity20 's government			1
' @entity2 was going to read the message out either to reporters or over the radio had @entity7 ended in defeat			2
the text , scribbled on a scrap of paper measuring 6ins by 4ins , reads : ' our landings in the @entity106 - @entity105 area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and i have withdrawn the troops			1
' my decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available			0
' the troops , the air , and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do			0
if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt , it is mine alone			0
' the message is dated july 5 , 1944 - it is thought that he wrote the wrong month in error due to exhaustion			0
it is said that before @entity7 the @entity3 high command considered a successful landing would cost 10,000 dead			2
in the event , the number of deaths were about 5,000			0
the majority of those were on @entity137 which was in the @entity19 sector			0
@entity139 , the deputy director of the @entity41 in @entity140 , @entity19 , said : ' to think that @entity2 was willing to take the full blame should @entity7 fail is quite telling of his character			1
' it is an example of a leading taking responsibility			0
' @entity20 's chief concern on d - day was a bloodbath on the beaches and @entity2 clearly felt the same as the plan was to withdraw rather than fight to the end			1
' @entity2 's adjutant officer was captain @entity155			2
about a month after @entity156 pulled this note out of his wallet and showed it to @entity155 who kept it			0
' it was donated to the library in the 1980s by his family			0
' @entity19 reinforcements wade through the surf from a landing craft in the days following @entity7 and the @entity3 invasion of @entity168 - occupied @entity167 at @entity24 in june 1944			1
