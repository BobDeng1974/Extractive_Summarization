by @entity0 scandal : a four - year - old girl lived with a foster parent who was a suspected paedophile for two weeks after the council was warned , it emerged today child protection campaigners have slammed social workers who allowed a four - year - old girl to stay with a foster parent for two weeks after they suspected he might be a paedophile			1
@entity11 failed to act instantly after police warned them the vulnerable child lived with an alleged sex offender , which the @entity15 believe could have put her at ' serious risk of harm '			1
the local authority has spent two months fighting a @entity21 battle to prevent details of the case being reported			2
but mr justice @entity24 found the council was ' unjustified ' in trying to keep criticism of its staff secret , and has overturned the gagging order			1
' it is in the public interest that these allegations are published , ' he said , according to @entity33 , who fought the injunction			1
@entity36 , @entity15 head of sexual abuse programmes told @entity38 : ' as soon as there are fears for the safety of a child they should be given the protection they need			0
' any delay could leave them at serious risk of harm			0
and anyone who works with vulnerable children should be properly vetted to ensure they are going to provide the right level of care and attention			0
' a family proceedings court hearing was told how the four - year - old child lived with the unnamed man for three months and then @entity11 were approached by police on may 14 2012 to say he was suspected of viewing child pornography			1
the same day the girl , called @entity60 in court papers , told her biological father and her social worker that another child living with the suspected paedophile had tried to throttle her			1
her real father called the police about the strangling , officers then told social services , who failed to act for a day , did not get her seen by a doctor and then the young girl was still sent back to the foster home			1
rebuttal : @entity11 ( pictured ) say they acted to remove the child as soon as it was confirmed the man was a suspected paedophile it took @entity11 another six days to decide what to do with the girl and then another seven days to remove her from the alleged sex offender 's home the foster father then committed suicide a day later , and it was found he had downloaded explicit pictures of children in 2010 but these offences were only revealed in 2012			1
the child was originally sent into foster care because of violence at home			2
her biological father told @entity33 : ' i am livid			0
they said she was n't safe at home but they put her whee someone had been downloading child abuse images			0
' @entity11 told @entity38 it takes its child protection duties seriously			2
' this has been a very sad case for all involved			0
' we have only ever sought the judgment of the court on this case to protect the interests of children , which the judge has very properly done through his ruling , and which we welcome			0
' as soon as it was confirmed the foster father was the prime suspect around the download of indecent images , we took immediate action , with the removal of children from the foster carers â€™ home			2
' we are always determined to learn from experience and are undertaking a thorough evaluation of practice , which will be reviewed independently			0
' this will consider if there are any wider issues or learning to be taken from this case			0
