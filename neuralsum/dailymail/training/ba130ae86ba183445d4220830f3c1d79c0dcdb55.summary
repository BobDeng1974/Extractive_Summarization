general sir @entity0 , the former chief of the general staff , said there was a ' grand strategic solution ' to the @entity3 @entity7 could have squeezed @entity8 ' out of existence ' two years ago if he had accepted a top secret plan presented to him by the army , the former head of the @entity6 military revealed today			1
general sir @entity0 said he gave the prime minister a strategy to defeat @entity15 president @entity14 in 2012 , but it was rejected			1
he said the plan would have removed the dictator from power and allowed the moderate @entity15 opposition to crush @entity8 radicals before they established a foothold			1
the revelation comes as @entity24 leaders consider plans to launch bombing raids on @entity8 rebel commanders holding key towns in northern @entity29 and @entity15 , where they claim to have carved out there own ' @entity30 '			1
speaking this morning , lord @entity0 said @entity8 had grown in power because the @entity32 had failed to help moderate opposition rebels topple president @entity14			1
the bombshell claim comes amid mounting criticism of president @entity37 after he admitted that he did not have a ' strategy ' to deal with the growing threat posed by @entity8			1
two @entity41 journalists - @entity42 and @entity43 - have been beheaded by fanatics from the self - proclaimed @entity30 and a @entity6 hostage , @entity46 , has been threatened with execution over @entity49 intervention in the region			0
lord @entity0 , speaking to the @entity52 's today programme , said @entity8 was finally being confronted - but suggested it had come far too late			1
he said if @entity6 had acted in 2012 @entity8 would not now exist			1
‘ back in 2011/12 when focussing on @entity14 i did offer a coherent military strategy to deal with that , ' he revealed			1
lord @entity0 added : ‘ it was too much , as someone said , more than the market would bare			2
people had n’t really understood the significance of what was happening in @entity15 at the time			2
and had n’t really realised that @entity8 could grow into the hydra that it has			2
’ he said his plan - which was presented to the prime minister and considered at the ' highest levels in @entity66 - envisaged supporting the opposition groups fighting @entity14 while growing and training a ‘ government in waiting ’			1
he said this would have taken around a year to put in place			0
he added : ‘ at the point of committal i can tell you we would have beaten @entity14			2
‘ and the @entity76 extremists would have been squeezed out of existence by their own people in the process because everyone just wants to win			0
‘ the reason @entity8 has developed in the way it has is in part through frustration at the lack of coherent and really meaningful assistance to the @entity87			2
@entity8 militants have threatened to kill @entity102 aid worker @entity46 who they are believed to be holding in @entity15			1
they have already beheaded two @entity41 journalists , posting the evidence on line in gruesome videos featuring a masked jihadist with a @entity6 accent			0
mr @entity95 said : ‘ we will do everything we can to protect this individual ( mr @entity46 ) but we have to be clear about the nature of the organisation that we are dealing with			0
‘ they are utterly brutal , they are ideologically driven - almost pathological in the way that they behave			0
we can not allow our strategy to be driven by their behaviour			0
‘ we have to approach the challenge of @entity8 with focus purely on what is in @entity6 ’s best interests - protecting our citizens and our security from the threat that @entity8 poses from foreign fighters , from potential attacks on our soil , destabilisation of the region			2
' lord @entity0 ' remarks came after mr @entity7 last night indicated @entity6 involvement in air strikes against jihadists in @entity15 and @entity29 could begin within weeks			1
the prime minister spoke publicly for the first time about striking @entity76 targets in @entity15 without president @entity14 ’s consent			1
he also signalled that @entity6 attacks on @entity8 forces could come as soon as the country agrees a new government this month			1
the development came after it emerged three senior members of @entity8 have been killed in a @entity41 airstrike in northern @entity29 , according to senior security officials			1
two days after a video showing the execution of @entity41 journalist @entity42 was released , @entity41 warplanes struck at the heart of @entity8 in @entity154 , northern @entity29 , killing the wanted jihadist @entity155 – the right hand man to terror chief , @entity156			1
lord @entity0 welcomed the growing evidence that a plan to beat @entity8 was finally emerging			1
he said : ‘ things have moved on pretty well			0
’ he added : ‘ if you think about it @entity8 has been contained which is the key first element of any strategy and has even started to be shrunk which i think is the next bit			2
' but he warned : ‘ we have n’t got a coherent generational strategy yet			0
‘ i do think that strategy , which we came up with in 2012 , could be the bare bones of how to deal with @entity8			1
‘ it was discussed at the highest levels in @entity66			2
but it was more than the market would bare , as i was told , and we got on and did what has happened between then and now			0
‘ it was n’t accepted , i do n’t think it could be the basis for something today			0
’ lord @entity0 said the first thing @entity6 had to do was to ‘ contain ’ @entity8			1
he said you then start ‘ squeezing the problem ’ before ultimately defeating it			0
he added : ‘ it ’s no good the world only thinking that @entity8 is the problem			2
this is happening all over the world			0
it needs to be the first stage in a much more grand strategic plan to once and for all deal with @entity189 extremism			0
’ he said we would have to deal with @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			0
the second stage is for @entity8 to be ‘ squeezed ’			0
he said that was not all about military			0
but he said : ‘ you ’ve got to get all nations in the world on side and most importantly the @entity203			0
’ the former military chief said the plan needed @entity49 leadership			0
he said ‘ one way or another ’ @entity6 and @entity41 would have to deal with @entity14 .			0

general sir @entity0 gave the pm a strategy to defeat @entity14 in 2012
@entity212 would have toppled @entity15 dictator for new government to crush @entity8
he said fanatics had emerged in the *vacuum* left by failure to remove @entity14
but plan was rejected by the prime minister and @entity66 as too radical
@entity224 comes as @entity24 leaders consider airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity29
