by @entity0 @entity2 star @entity1 , who plays @entity3 , is a dad again ! @entity1 and his wife of three years , @entity5 , welcomed their first child together on june 11			1
@entity8 arrived just before 3 am. , with @entity1 having to report to work on the set of days just 4 hours later ! ' luckily my baby daughter was born at a hospital very close to work so all i had to do was show up with a smile on my face , and the make - up people took care of the circles under my eyes , ' he tells @entity19 in an exclusive interview			2
oh baby ! @entity2 star @entity1 and his wife @entity5 are the proud parents of @entity24 , who weighed in at 6lbs 13oz heartthrob : @entity1 has been playing character @entity3 for 20 years on tv 's longest running soap @entity1 , 42 , says it ’s been an adjustment being a dad again 14 years after his son @entity31 was born			1
' first i think it ’s going to be different parenting a little girl compared to being the father of a boy , ' @entity1 tells @entity19			2
' i want @entity37 to grow up to be a strong man , so sometimes i think i am a bit hard on him			0
but i ’m afraid i ’m going to be putty in the hands of a little girl			0
' when i first looked into @entity24 ’s little face , i saw a lot of myself			2
she has my mouth and eyes , and there is something very familiar about her			0
' @entity1 , whose son from his first marriage lives with him and his wife , says some of the best times he shares with @entity37 are watching and participating in sports , and he ca n’t help but wonder if @entity24 will chose shopping trips with mom or curling up on the couch with the boys to watch			1
' i coach @entity37 ’s basketball , football and baseball teams , ' says @entity1			2
' and it ’s been a great bonding time for us			0
i ’d love to coach @entity24 too , and am hoping she will be interested in tennis , soccer or softball			2
but i will be just as happy sitting in the front row watching her first dance recital			0
whatever makes her happy will make me happy too ! ' big brother : @entity1 's son @entity31 , 14 , is beaming with pride over the new addition to the family @entity1 and @entity5 also chose to bank the baby ’s cord blood with a company called cryo - cell			1
' we did a lot of research into banking cord blood , ' says @entity1			1
' and one of the prime uses for stem cells is to help treat lymphoma or @entity91			1
and @entity24 has grandfathers on both sides who have those illnesses			2
' so who knows , maybe someday the blood we banked will benefit one of them			0
' banking cord blood taken from a newborn ’s umbilical cord is becoming very popular practice because the stem cells found in the cord are younger and more flexible than those found in adults			1
the stem cells also know how to ‘ find , ’ injured cells and repair them			1
currently the stem cells are being used in transplants and for the treatment of more than 80 diseases including certain cancers , anemia , and @entity91			1
the cells are also a perfect match for baby should she need it sometime in the future			0
an affair to remember : what @entity2 fan can forget @entity122 , played by @entity123 , and @entity3 ' wedding in 2007 and when it comes to the kids wanting to follow in their famous father ’s footsteps @entity1 admits he ’s not sure			1
' of course i want both of them to do whatever makes them happy , ' he says			0
' but i will explain that being an actor is n’t as easy as it looks			0
there are a nights where i have to memorize 20 pages of dialogue only to turn around and do the same thing the following day			0
' and the audition process , with its high rate of rejection , is really hard on a person			0
it ’s one of the only careers where you can work hard and do your very best and still not book the job			0
' @entity1 has been starring in @entity2 for 20 years .			1
