@entity0 set up one and scored another to hand @entity2 his first win as @entity5 manager			1
the @entity6 international provided the centre for @entity10 ’s comical early own goal and then thrashed in a late second to get former @entity12 boss @entity2 off the mark at the sixth attempt			1
@entity2 ’s @entity5 came into the contest six points adrift of safety in their fight against relegation and with just one victory in their last 17 championship matches			0
@entity5 's @entity0 ( centre ) is congratulated after his cross was turned in by @entity26 ' @entity10 ( right ) - @entity27 then thrashed in a second for @entity5 to record their first win under manager @entity2 their previous points haul under the @entity31 stood at an anaemic one and his drastic action in response to their recent home defeat to @entity36 was to drop three of their 2013 @entity38 - winning team – @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 – among four changes and switch to a back three			1
yet the visiting players had barely had time to get used to the new wing - backs system when they were gifted an 11th - minute lead			0
@entity0 ’s pace down the left flank saw him outstrip @entity49 and although his cross from the byline suggested little danger , @entity10 inexplicably chested the ball into his own net attempting to tidy things up			2
@entity5 had lost their previous four away trips in the league but with a rare advantage to defend restricted @entity26 to minimal sights of their goal in the remainder of the opening period			2
in fact , @entity63 , who made his debut for @entity26 during their life as a @entity67 club , was not tested at all in the visitors ’ goal			0
@entity26 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity71 7 ; @entity72 7 , @entity49 6 , @entity10 5 , @entity73 6 ; @entity74 6 ( @entity76 46mins , 6 ) , @entity75 6 , @entity77 7 , @entity78 6 ( @entity79 46mins , 7 ) ; @entity80 6 ( @entity81 71mins ) , @entity82 7 subs ( not used ) : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 @entity5 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity63 8 ; perch 7 , @entity88 7 , @entity89 7 ; @entity90 6 , @entity91 6 , @entity92 6 , @entity93 6 , @entity84 6 ; @entity0 8 , @entity94 6 ( @entity95 70 mins , 6 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity39 , @entity99 referee : @entity101 7 and on the only occasion they did beat their former goalkeeper , @entity106 ’s dink into the area on 28 minutes was glanced onto the crossbar from a flick of strike partner @entity80 ’s head			1
the complexion of the game changed after the interval as @entity26 manager @entity114 reacted to a lack of urgency and re-shaped his own team , sacrificing the @entity119 ’s young player of the month @entity78 and @entity74 to employ @entity76 in a three - man attack with fellow substitute @entity121 offering a more direct running option from midfield			0
those changes provided @entity26 with greater intensity and that was evident almost immediately as @entity77 ’s burst into the box set up @entity106 only for a deflection to save @entity5			0
then , from the resulting corner – one of seven in the opening quarter - hour of the second period – @entity49 latched onto a half - clearance to force @entity63 into a spectacular tip - over from a 20 - yard drive			0
however , their purple patch failed to yield an equalizer and @entity0 – who was foiled by @entity26 keeper @entity71 ’s legs with a rare shot with his right foot – sealed it with his left eight minutes from time when @entity5 made the most of their superior numbers on a breakaway .			1

@entity26 ' @entity10 scored an own goal in the 11th minute
@entity0 *claimed* the *assist* after his cross was turned in
@entity0 then *clinched* the win for @entity5 in the 83rd minute
@entity5 's win is the first under @entity2 at the sixth attempt
