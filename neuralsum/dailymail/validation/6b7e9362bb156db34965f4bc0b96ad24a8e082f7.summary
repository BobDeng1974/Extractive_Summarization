a woman shed an incredible nine stone after posting pictures of all of her meals on @entity4 - and getting people to rate how healthy they are			1
@entity6 , 22 , takes a series of pictures of what she is about to eat , posts them on her page and waits to see what her followers think of her food			1
it may sound like a bizarre routine but uploading hundreds of such snaps online has helped @entity6 lose nine stone and six dress sizes in two years			1
the positive comments were the confidence boost she needed to carry on after binge - eating and fad diets @entity6 found motivation to slim by publicly sharing details of her meals , their calorie count and her weight - loss progress			1
inspired by the online feedback she received - mostly from strangers - she shrank from 22st and a dress size 24 , to 13st and size 12			1
research unit manager @entity6 says : ' like most women , i had tried every diet under the sun but none worked for me			1
' i thought i was doomed to be overweight for ever but when i started counting calories on a phone app and sharing pictures of my meals i was amazed at how many comments i received			1
' i started documenting the change in my figure as i lost weight and it was a great way to see my progress and keep me on track whenever i felt like reaching for the biscuit tin			2
' if i did n't stick to the diet i was n't just letting myself down , i 'd be letting down all my followers too			2
@entity6 began focusing on losing weight by sharing her healthy meals when her doctor told her that she would be dead before she was 25 @entity6 began cooking meals from scratch and eventually sharing her own recipes or ingredients on @entity4 22 - stone @entity6 had tried ' every diet under the sun ' but nothing had worked for her the pressure kept me motivated , as did all the lovely comments i got - and now i feel amazing			1
you could say that i have instagrammed myself thin			2
' at just seven , a gym accident left @entity6 struggling to carry on with the sport and she ballooned in size			1
@entity6 , of @entity73 , @entity74 , says : ' i hated not being able to do my gymnastics so comfort - ate and soon started to pile on the pounds			1
' i then started getting bullied at school			2
the other children would say really nasty things to me			2
my school days became a nightmare			2
i 'd hide myself away in the toilets			0
' ashamed of her growing belly , from the age of ten , @entity6 began raiding stashes of food from her parents ' kitchen and hiding it to later gorge on in secret			1
she says : ' i 'd grab anything i could get my hands on and would hide it from my mum and dad			0
when i was feeling sad , i turned to the snacks for some comfort			0
' but the cruel playground taunts went on and @entity6 's weight continued to climb			1
bullied at school , @entity6 began to hide herself away and gorge on food in secret at just the age of seven , @entity6 , from @entity73 , @entity74 , had a gym accident which left her unable to continue with sports			1
at this point , her weight began to balloon by the time she sat her gcses in 2008 , age 15 , @entity6 was 14st and a dress size 16			1
a year later , in the summer of 2009 , @entity6 was given a confidence boost when she met her now ex-boyfriend			1
she says : ' he did n't care about my body and used to compliment me all the time			0
all my body hang - ups were suddenly washed away and i felt happier			0
' but the nights spent cuddled up on the sofa , still eating the comfort food , only served to worsen @entity6 's weight problem			1
@entity6 says : ' we settled into a really unhealthy routine			1
i was happy because i was in love but this had such an awful effect on my health			0
' we spent every night slumped on the sofa			0
we 'd have a huge bag of crisps each and a whole tub of ice cream to ourselves			2
looking back , i 'm disgusted by how much we ate			0
' over the course of just two and half years , @entity6 ballooned to a size 24 , putting on another 7st to reach 22st			1
her office job meant she spent most of her day sat at her desk - and she took no exercise			0
she says : ' it got to the point where i was getting out of breath just from walking			0
when @entity6 began sharing her meals on @entity4 and counting calories , she began to get positive comments , which motivated her even more ' i was even afraid to go out dancing with my friends because i 'd get so hot and tired - i would be dripping with sweat before i had even walked into the club			1
' in 2011 , @entity6 visited her gp for a check - up and was given a devastating wake - up call - either she turned around her lifestyle or she would be dead before she was 35			1
shortly after , she split with her boyfriend and moved back home with her parents			0
she recalls : ' i wanted to lose weight and was a sucker for a fad diet			0
' first i tried cutting out sugar , then i tried a low - carb diet			0
' i tried the @entity159 and @entity160 diets but never managed to stick to anything for more than a few weeks and nothing seemed to shift the weight			0
' by the summer of 2012 , @entity6 was feeling helpless - but then she heard about app @entity164			2
she says : ' a friend told me about it and i thought i would give it a go			0
it allowed me to put in my height , weight and goal weight and it told me to eat no more than 1,600 calories a day			0
' the app outlined her new diet - to eat 50 per cent carbs , 30 per cent fat and 20 per cent protein - and although she stuck to the plan at first , she began to struggle to keep herself motivated			0
then @entity4 came into play			2
@entity6 found that looking at other people 's weight - loss journeys helped her motivate her on her own she says : ' a friend had told me about all the healthy - eating accounts on @entity4 , so at first i used the search function to look for ideas			1
it really helped to see other people 's weight - loss journeys and it made me realise i could share mine			0
' motivated to ditch chocolate and crisps , @entity6 started cooking @entity4 - inspired meals from scratch and sharing them			1
she received many likes from other healthy eaters and , once her cooking skills got up to scratch , began creating her own healthy recipes and sharing them			2
only two months later , @entity6 had lost three stone and gained hundreds of followers			2
she says : ' once i plucked up confidence i joined the gym when i 'd lost about 4st			0
this is when i started taking post-workout pictures			0
' i started to post almost everything i ate and uploaded post-workout photos to show my followers how much i 'd worked out			0
i did mostly cardio as i was too scared to use the weights			0
' people commented on how good i looked and it was just the confidence boost i needed to carry on			0
' by last december , two and a half years into her regime , @entity6 had lost a mighty nine stone			1
she says : ' if it was n't for @entity4 , i 'd still weigh 22st			1
you can try all the fad diets but all you need is to eat healthily and to have some encouragement			0
i 've never been happier			0
' before breakfast : coffee and chocolate bar lunch : two sandwiches , one packet of crisps , two chocolate bars , yoghurt dinner : meat with potatoes after dinner : crisps , bars of chocolate and hot chocolate now breakfast : oats in natural yoghurt with fruit snack : carrot sticks and hummus lunch : sweet potato with chicken breast , cottage cheese and broccoli dinner : stuffed peppers with sausage , feta and couscous			2
