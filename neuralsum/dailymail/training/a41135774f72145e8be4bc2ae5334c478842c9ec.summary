the ' @entity15 9 ' drill was held near the @entity16 , through which about a fifth of the world 's oil passes			1
the staged attack comes just weeks ahead of a deadline for @entity1 and world powers to forge a historic deal on the fate of the @entity38 's nuclear program			2
@entity1 live - fire war games are not uncommon			2
but by simulating for the first time an attack on the ultimate symbol of @entity5 naval power , hard - liners hoped to send a message that @entity1 has no intention of backing down to the @entity5 - whichever way talks over its contested nuclear program go			1
the guard 's navy chief , adm. @entity49 , said : ' @entity5 aircraft carriers are very big ammunition depots housing a lot of missiles , rockets , torpedoes and everything else			1
' he added that a direct hit by a missile could set off a large secondary explosion			0

in addition to the carrier attack , the drill included the guard shooting down a drone and planting mines at sea the @entity10 said it test - fired 223 mph underwater missiles during the @entity77 9 drill the @entity77 9 drill featured ' speedboats equipped with naval radars , electronic communications systems , cruise missiles with a range of 25 kilometers , anti-ship medium - range missiles , medium - and large - caliber torpedoes , sea mines , heavy machine guns , rocket - launchers and shoulder - fired surface - to - air missiles ' , according to @entity89 said			1
the @entity10 said it test - fired 223 mph underwater missiles during the drill			2
tensions near the @entity16 have caused oil prices to spike in the past - good news for producers like @entity1			1

@entity100 showed footage of missiles fired from the coast and the fast boats striking the carrier			0
the drills also included @entity108 forces shooting down a drone and planting undersea mines			0
footage did not show that the assault had managed to sink the mock - up , but it was heavily damaged			0
the guard 's chief commander , gen. @entity115 , indicated the drills send a ' message of [ @entity1 's ] might ' to ' extraterritorial powers , ' a reference to the @entity5			1

@entity137 added the @entity5 military was ' not concerned about this exercise			1
' he said : ' we 're quite confident of our naval forces ' ability to defend themselves			0
' it seems they 've attempted to destroy the equivalent of a @entity149 movie set			0
' the @entity5 routinely stations at least one aircraft carrier and other warships in and around the @entity13			1
it and its allies conduct periodic naval exercises of their own in the region , including ones aimed at countering the threat from undersea mines that could be used to block ship traffic through the strait			0
the @entity5 aircraft carrier @entity164 is currently deployed in the @entity13 , as is the @entity123 carrier @entity166			1
planes from both vessels are carrying out airstrikes against the @entity126 , which has seized roughly a third of @entity171 and @entity172			2
@entity1 backs @entity172 's government and is supporting @entity171 in its fight against the militants , but it is not part of the @entity5 - led international coalition against the extremist group			1
the drills were not publicly announced in advance , but the guard has previously held similar military exercises around this time of year			0
the last one , in february 2013 , featured ' suicide drones ' that attack enemies kamikaze - style			0
