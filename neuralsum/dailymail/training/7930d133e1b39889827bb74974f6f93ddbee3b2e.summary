by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 joked on thursday that he hoped @entity3 would play a half for @entity5 against @entity6 after travelling to @entity7 with just one recognised striker in his squad			1
@entity5 went down 1 - 0 to the @entity11 side in the early hours of sunday morning with @entity2 opting to start with @entity12 in an advanced attacking role , while @entity15 , the only out and out forward in the party , came on at the break			2
although it is still early days in terms of @entity5 's pre-season , with many senior stars still absent due to their participation in the later stages of the @entity23 , @entity2 has still not resolved the issue that dogged his side for much of last season : their lack of reliable experienced cover for @entity29			1
step up : @entity30 could be among the players to benefit from a false nine role at @entity5 next season know how : @entity34 will have experienced playing without an attacker at @entity36 experience : @entity38 has played as a central attacker for @entity5 before and performed well embarrassment of riches : @entity2 must find a way to solve @entity5 's lack of strikers the @entity44 will contest the @entity45 on august 2 and 3 before the real business begins in the @entity47 against @entity48 on august 10 and then in the @entity49 a week later meaning @entity2 must already be giving serious consideration to formations which will allow him to get the maximum out of his exciting squad next season			1
in stark contrast to his striking options @entity2 boasts an embarrassment of riches in attacking midfield , where he can call upon @entity12 , @entity34 , @entity30 and @entity38 among others			1
@entity30 will return buoyed by @entity62 's success at the @entity23 and eager to silence critics who have claimed he failed to fully justify his price tag during his first season in @entity67			0
@entity34 , another big - money signing , will arrive keen to make an instant impact after being deemed surplus to requirements at @entity36 , while @entity38 's return from injury , expected early - to - mid - september , will see the @entity67 international faced with real competition for his place in the team			2
a good fit : incorporating a false nine would suit the games of @entity79 and @entity80 unfamiliar : midfielder @entity12 led the @entity5 attack against @entity6 in a squad which also includes @entity83 , @entity79 , @entity84 and @entity80 , @entity2 could have to think hard about how to get the best of the talent at his disposal while keeping everyone happy			1
the need for more depth up front is crucial if @entity5 are to mount a proper challenge for the @entity49 title			0
@entity29 shouldered the responsibility well last season , scoring 16 league goals , but that burden must be shared if @entity2 's side 's challenge are not going to fall away at a crucial stage of the season again			0
a serious option for @entity5 is to employ a false nine , an interchangeable forward threat that would allow @entity2 to really maximise the players in his team			2
winner : @entity62 's lack of traditional strikers did n't stop @entity108 leading them to win the @entity23 @entity110 system : @entity30 was part of @entity62 's free - scoring side which thrashed @entity113 7 - 1 and @entity114 4 - 0 video @entity116 trio to miss start of season - @entity2 employed with great success by @entity120 and @entity36 in recent years , and given a revamp by @entity62 at the @entity23 , the role requires its candidate to be comfortable in the attacking third , dragging defenders out of position and bringing team - mates into play - a system @entity5 players are already well versed in			1
@entity108 , like @entity2 , is a manager blessed with countless attacking options but not many out and out strikers in the traditional sense			0
the @entity62 coach used this to great effect in @entity113 as his side won the @entity23 with @entity30 in the team , thrashing @entity114 4 - 0 and @entity113 7 - 1 along the way , showing that a shortage of strikers does n't have to be a shortcoming			0
given the players currently available to @entity2 this system could bring the best out of @entity30 , @entity34 and @entity38 and really give them the platform to thrive like it did for @entity62 's new generation of stars			1
and unlike in the striking department , @entity2 would be able to factor in injuries and squad rotation without the standard dropping off			0
although it is not clear if @entity2 intends to continue his experimentation with this system when he integrates @entity30 and @entity34 back into his squad in the next fortnight , it is obvious that he needs to find a proper @entity155 to ensure the raw talent of @entity157 is n't the only back - up to @entity29			1
the answer will come when @entity30 , @entity34 and @entity38 are fully fit and vying for a spot in the team			2
then he will have another attacking headache on his hands , although this time a considerably more comfortable one			0
solo : @entity29 shouldered the responsibility for much of @entity5 's goalscoring threat last season			0

@entity29 is currently the only senior striker in the @entity5 squad
@entity12 led the attack in the *friendly* against @entity6
@entity2 joked about his lack of striking options *pre-match*
@entity44 should consider a false nine in order to get best of @entity30 , @entity34 and @entity38
@entity120 , @entity36 and @entity62 have all used the system successfully
