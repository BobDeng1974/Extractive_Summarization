' in the pre-record situation , when you 're testing the microphones and all the rest of it , he suddenly started with the wandering hands and groping , ' she told @entity26			2
' when he put his hand on my leg i said " you can stop that right now " and i stood up and said " you 're a sleazy creep "			1
' at that point he got a bit nasty and the publicist came in and smoothed things over			0
' ms @entity3 , now aged in her 50s , said that after she called out @entity1 over his behaviour he ' began to cut up rough ( became angry ) and protest and called me a couple of names ' before the publicist intervened and he apologised			1
interview : ms @entity3 said she was in her mid- 20s and working at a regional radio station in the 1980s when she had to interview the star , who was touring the country at the time @entity42 said she never reported the incident because it was ' on the absolute minor end of the scale ' of the abuses committed by @entity1 , and she had largely forgotten about it until his trial began			1
however , she said the incident showed how @entity1 thought he could act with impunity because of his fame , and that the situation could have been far more serious if he had molested someone who was younger or more vulnerable and not willing to stand up to him			1
' it seemed that he was pretty confident and arrogant if he thought he could try it on with someone like me , ' she said			0
' when you look back with hindsight , seems that even 30 years ago he had been getting away with a lot			0

mr @entity93 will have to pass a sentence taking into account all the offending , and may consider @entity1 's old age			2
on monday he warned the musician 's legal team that he is likely to face prison			0

the once - loved entertainer was finally exposed as a serial sex offender at the end of his trial on monday , his hypocrisy brought into sharp relief by the fact he had funded and starred in an educational film warning children of the dangers of paedophiles			0

she was off sick from school at a family friend 's house in @entity125 in 1969 , when @entity1 told her : ' i want to be the first person to introduce you to a tongue kiss ' , before he pounced			1
