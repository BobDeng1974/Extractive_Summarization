@entity0 euphorically claimed to have ‘ got the monkey off our backs ’ with this first away win in nine months , but @entity5 ’s own pesky primate continues to weigh them down after yet another setback at home			1
there was a full house at kings - holm on sunday but the mood of festive cheer in the renowned shed was soon wiped away			2
the hosts were desperate to atone for the emphatic loss at the hands of @entity17 at the same ground eight days earlier but instead they slumped to a fourth defeat in their last five home games in the @entity21			2
what was once an intimidating stronghold has become far too welcoming			2
man of the match @entity24 kicks one of his two penalties to add to his three conversions for @entity0 @entity0 hit back with @entity28 providing the pass for @entity30 to cruise in for their first try while @entity5 remain ninth with persistent problems to address , @entity0 have risen to sixth after their first victory on the road since beating @entity36 on march 21			1
first - half tries by @entity30 , @entity28 and @entity38 came as an astute kicking game spread panic in the @entity42 ranks			1
despite @entity5 ’s stirring second - half fightback , @entity0 held on to claim a win which was arguably more significant even than the success on their first outing at the @entity48 last week			1
director of rugby @entity49 said : ‘ we got the monkey off our back			2
coming into this we ’d won all our home games and lost all our away games			0
it was nice to get that away victory			0
‘ in the first half we controlled the game and i was really pleased			0
at half - time we talked about things we needed to do in the second half and we pretty much did none of them			2
we turned over the ball eight or nine times and put ourselves under pressure			0
‘ but i was pretty pleased with how we closed the game out			0
we found a way to win			0
it gives us confidence to go away and grind out a victory , especially in the last five minutes because i ’ve lost count of how many games we ’ve lost in the last five			0
’ @entity5 's @entity78 centre @entity79 is tackled by @entity0 ' @entity80 @entity81 initially reaches just short of the line but continues his move to chalk up @entity5 's first try @entity78 wing may composes himself on the slide before putting the ball down in the corner @entity5 's @entity91 international @entity90 kicks one of his two conversions - he also kicked three penalties at @entity95 in the one - try loss @entity0 half - backs @entity24 and @entity97 had @entity5 in disarray with their aerial onslaught in the first half , but only after @entity81 had given the home side a first - minute lead			1
when @entity103 ’s cut - out pass reached @entity104 , he picked out @entity78 wing may , who cut inside to score and @entity107 converted			1
what followed was grim viewing for the shed as their heroes unravelled in defence			0
in the ninth minute , @entity28 broke through @entity113 ’s tackle on the flank and offloaded superbly for @entity30 to go over from close range			1
@entity24 ’s conversion began his flawless return which yielded 12 points from three conversions and two penalties			1
in the 20th minute , the veteran fly - half ’s high kick into the 22 bounced awkwardly behind @entity123 and @entity28 was able to gather and surge past the flailing @entity113 to touch down			1
there was a powerful riposte as @entity5 ’s pack rumbled forward from a lineout for @entity129 to strike but they were soon exposed again at the other end , in identical fashion , as the @entity0 eight drove @entity38 over to score			1
@entity28 then bagged a five - pointer of his own after picking up a speculative kick from @entity24 @entity0 turned down a kickable penalty before @entity38 finished off a strong line - out drive after a dressing - down at half - time , the home side rallied strongly and three penalties by @entity90 brought them back to within a point on the hour			1
but there was to be no glorious comeback as @entity24 and @entity143 struck late penalties			1
@entity5 ’s director of rugby @entity145 said : ‘ at the start of our year , one of our targets was to make @entity95 a difficult place for teams to come but our recent results here have n’t backed that up			1
‘ after another home defeat , the long - term plan does n’t seem as important as getting short - term results			2
we all know we are in a results business and we want to win			0
but we also know we have good players and there are aspects of our game that are improving			0
we are four months into a long - term project			2
the fans know that we ’re not where we want to be , but they realise that we are a work in progress			0
’ @entity168 , @entity5 ’s @entity169 - winning all black prop , delivered his own damning assessment , adding : ‘ it was really disappointing			1
you look at the body language of the boys — really down and out			0
we let another game slip through our fingers			0
we are down in confidence			0
maybe some guys are not making the right calls			0
