@entity0 was taking place between @entity2 and the @entity3 hundreds of years before @entity4 arrived in the area in 1492			0
this is according to a series of bronze artefacts found at the ' @entity10 ' site in @entity11 , @entity12			1
archaeologists discovered what they believe to be a bronze and leather buckle and a bronze whistle , dating to around a.d. 600			1
@entity0 was taking place between @entity2 and the @entity3 hundreds of years before @entity4 ( left ) arrived in 1492			0
the discovery was made after archaeologists found what they believe to be a bronze and leather buckle ( right ) , dating to around a.d. 600 bronze - working had not been developed at this time in @entity12 , and researchers instead believe the artefacts were created in @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28			1
' we 're seeing the interactions , indirect as they are , with these so - called ' high civilisations ' of @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 , ' @entity29 , a research associate at the @entity30 , told @entity35			1
' native copper and meteoritic iron were hammered into a variety objects by late prehistoric inhabitants of arctic and subarctic @entity40 , ' reports the research team on the website @entity43			0
' [ but ] there is no evidence for the smelting , casting , or alloying of metals in the @entity50 north of @entity51 prior to the arrival of @entity53			0

researchers believe those who lived at the @entity10 site may be part of what scientists call the ' @entity64 ' culture ' as a result , these two artefacts give the best and least ambiguous evidence to date that non-ferrous industrial smelted metals were arriving in @entity12 via prehistoric trade across the @entity71			1

this is a group of people who lived on both sides of the @entity71 and used advanced skin boats			1
they are believed to have lived in small family dwellings containing either an entrance that led to a single room with sleeping platforms			0
@entity85 settlements were small , with only a few families living in a settlement at a time			2
they were talented seal hunters , known for their use of innovative equipment , such as ice scratchers to lure seals over frozen waters			0
they were also known for their use of ground slate weapons , including knives , blades , arrows , and spears			0

this is a group of people who lived on both sides of the @entity71 and used skin boats and harpoons to hunt whales , @entity35 reports			1
the latest discovery of bronze artefacts backs up earlier evidence for trade between @entity12 and other civilisations prior to 1492			1
inside the house , tests on obsidian items – created by volcanic glass – had previously suggested they came from the @entity124 valley in @entity125			0
@entity35 notes that anthropologist @entity126 published an analysis of texts and artefacts in the journal @entity131 in 1913 , in which he found that the @entity26 had an interest in obtaining ivory			1
he said that some of the walrus ivory may have come from the @entity71			2
there is also evidence that plate armour made using ivory and bones began appearing in @entity12 around 1,000 years ago			2
a controversial hypothesis , put forward by amateur historian @entity143 , suggests that @entity26 discovered the @entity144 70 years before @entity4			0
he bases his theory on an alleged 18th century copy of a 1418 map charted by @entity26 admiral @entity149 , which appears to show the @entity3 in some detail its overlapping style is similar to plate armour developed in @entity2 , thousands of years ago			2

' the traditional story of @entity4 discovering the @entity3 is absolute fantasy , it 's fairy tales , ' mr @entity143 told @entity164			0
among @entity143 other claims are that the first inhabitants of the @entity50 did n't come over land from the @entity71 , but instead were @entity26 sailors who first crossed the @entity169 40,000 years ago			1
he also writes that @entity171 markers prove @entity173 @entity172 and other natives are the descendants of several waves of @entity177 settlers			0
most scientists believe that humans arrived in the @entity3 15,000 years ago by crossing the now - flooded land bridge that had formed across the @entity71			1
but a recent genetic study suggests there were also journeys taken by people from @entity2 to the @entity3 at a later date			0
@entity11 , where the discovery was made , is a cape located on the @entity188 in @entity12 , on the @entity190 coast			1

bronze buckle and whistle from ad 600 found in @entity11
but bronze - working had not been developed at this time in @entity12
scientists believe artefacts were created in @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28
@entity200 may have been home to ' @entity85 ' culture , whose people travelled on both sides of the @entity71
