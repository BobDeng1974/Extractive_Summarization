by @entity1 reporter published : 14:59 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 14:59 est , 3 november 2013 @entity3 @entity2 dumped @entity4 as a potential presidential running mate last year after discovering ' potential landmines ' in his background checks , according to a new book			1
@entity2 ’s lawyers prepared a secret 35 - page report which revealed @entity4 frequently overspent on official trips , steered government contracts to allies and had been sued for defamation			1
now there are fears the explosive revelations could hurt the @entity20 governor 's re-election chances on tuesday , even though he is a frontrunner for the job			1
the book claims @entity2 included @entity4 on his shortlist of five possible candidates , impressed by the governor 's forthrightness and ability to connect with voters			1
however , ' controversies lurking in the shadows of his record ' put @entity2 off and he scrapped him			0
' the dossier on the @entity20 governor ’s background was littered with potential land mines , ' the authors wrote , according to @entity56			1
vetters were concerned after discovering a 2010 @entity60 inspector general ’s investigation of @entity4 ’s spending patterns in his job prior to the governorship			0
the report criticized him for being ' the @entity67 attorney who most often exceeded the government [ travel expense ] rate without adequate justification ' and for offering ' insufficient , inaccurate , or no justification ' for stays at lavish hotels			0
@entity75 : it bothered @entity2 ( left ) that @entity4 frequently showed up at @entity2 's fundraising events late they were also concerned that @entity4 worked as a lobbyist on behalf of the @entity80 when @entity81 was a senior @entity80 official and sought an exemption from @entity20 ’s @entity83			1
@entity4 ’s decision to steer hefty government contracts to donors and political allies like former attorney general @entity88 , which sparked a congressional hearing , was considered a ' landmine '			0
the authors also explained that @entity4 , who is widely seen as a top candidate among @entity3 for 2016 , left unanswered questions about a defamation lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career			2
the book also claimed @entity4 avoided information about a @entity101 settlement involving his brother , @entity102 , who acknowledged making ' hundreds of trades in which customers had been systematically overcharged			0
' all of that was on top of a litany of glaring matters that concerned @entity2 and his team			0
these included @entity4 ’s other lobbying clients , his investments overseas , the @entity116 clips which called into doubt his presidential temperament , his tardiness and his weight			0

' @entity2 marveled at @entity4 's girth , ' according to the book			1
' watching a video of @entity4 without his suit jacket on , @entity2 cackled to his aides " guys ! look at that " '			2
@entity2 's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed ' @entity132 ' , but @entity4 was given the name ' @entity133 ' because of his size			1
mean : super-fit @entity2 often mocked @entity4 's weight behind his back ' @entity37 ' provides an explosive account of the 2012 presidential election campaign meanwhile , @entity4 has branded the vetting forms ' intrusive ' , saying the @entity2 campaign expected him to complete 75 pages			1
' asked about stuff with your kids , and issues with your children , obviously criminal record , mental health issues drinking history , drug history , ' he told @entity153 for ' @entity154 '			0
' in a separate statement , he said he ' complied fully with the @entity2 campaign ’s request for documents in a timely manner '			1
however , it appears the portly governor did his own form of vetting on @entity2 's campaign team			1
he once called them a ' gaggle of clowns who could n't organize a one - ring circus '			0
and when he came under fire for his @entity172 speech , claims the book , @entity4 confronted @entity174 , a @entity2 aide , and screamed : ' i 'm tired of you people ! ! ! leave me the f * * * k alone ! ! ! ! ' meanwhile , @entity2 has tried to distance himself from the book 's startling revelations			1
this morning , he said @entity4 was ' one of the strongest lights ' of the @entity3 and dismissed ' potential land mines ' detailed in @entity37 as old news			2
' at this stage you look at @entity4 and say that ’s a very impressive guy with a great track record , with a demonstrated ability to work across the aisle , with support of labor and blue - collar voters in @entity20 , ' @entity2 said on @entity193 , according to @entity194			2
' @entity4 stands out as one of the very strongest lights of the @entity3			0
