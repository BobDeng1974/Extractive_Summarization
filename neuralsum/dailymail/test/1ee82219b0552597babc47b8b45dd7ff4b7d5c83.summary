the @entity1 sergeant who left his post in @entity3 and was held by the @entity4 for five years was found to have be ' going over to the other side with a deliberate plan , ' according to a former military intelligence officer			1
lt. col. @entity8 said on @entity10 ' @entity9 on monday night that @entity11 ' had @entity3 contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the @entity4			1
' the former military intelligence officer said he had been told the information by two senior sources who knew about a 2009 @entity17 investigation into @entity11 's activities			1
' he had made contact with local @entity3 and wanted to be moved to @entity26 and then made contact with the @entity29 because he wanted to talk to @entity29 organized crime , ' @entity8 told @entity31			1
' clearly he was not all there relating to what he was doing			0
i think we 're going to see more and more , as this report is made public that there were a number of disconcerting things within @entity11			2
' lt. col. @entity8 ( pictured ) said on @entity10 ' ' @entity9 ' on monday night that @entity11 ' had @entity3 contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the @entity4			1
both are very severe ' he said the @entity42 , which included interviews with squad mates , indicated that @entity11 made contact with an @entity3 in an attempt to prepare for his departure			1
@entity11 will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the @entity51 ' desertion with @entity53 to @entity54 or @entity55 ' : @entity56 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he ' quits his unit , organization , or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service			1
' it can carry a death sentence but the military wo n't seek that option in the @entity11 case @entity71 : 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay ' @entity78 ' : article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy			1
' @entity71 : life in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay @entity1 officials announced thursday that his @entity56 hearing will be held july 8 at @entity103 , @entity104 - he is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy			1
that proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury			0
from there , it could be referred to a court - martial and go to trial			0
his attorney says @entity11 was trying to find a @entity117 general officer to report a disturbing situation when he left his combat outpost			2
@entity120 , the attorney leading @entity11 's defense , said in a letter released this week that the @entity1 major general who investigated @entity11 's capture in @entity3 found he did not intend to remain away from his base permanently			1
@entity11 disappeared in june , 2009 from a combat post in @entity127 in eastern @entity3 and was captured by the @entity4			1
he spent five years as a prisoner of war before he was freed last summer in a prisoner swap that angered members of congress members and some members of his unit			0
after an investigation of the circumstances of his capture , @entity11 was charged this week with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy , counts that could lead to life in prison			1
documents released by his defense lawyers suggested the tack they may take in defending @entity11			2
the papers also included a statement from @entity11 about his attempts to escape from his @entity4 captors and his beatings while a prisoner			1
in a march 2 letter to army general @entity153 , who was responsible for deciding how to proceed with the case , @entity120 said an investigation by an @entity1 major general had concluded that @entity11 did not plan to desert			2
' while hedging its bets , the report basically concludes that sergeant @entity11 did not intend to remain away from the @entity1 permanently , as classic ' long ' desertion requires , ' @entity120 wrote			2
' it also concludes that his specific intent was to bring what he thought were disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general office , ' he added			0
@entity11 , shown before his handover to @entity117 troops in may 2014 @entity120 declined to elaborate further on friday			2
@entity11 was released in exchange for five @entity4 leaders held at @entity170			1
they were sent to @entity172 and had to remain there for a year			0
some @entity117 lawmakers were angered by @entity11 's release because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the @entity170 prisoners , as required by law			1
some fellow soldiers also said he had deserted			0
' while many @entity117 have taken a broader and more sympathetic view , the depth and breadth of the current hostility to sergeant @entity11 are extraordinary and have enveloped the case with a lynch mob atmosphere , ' @entity120 said			0
' @entity4 five ' : the terror leaders traded for @entity11 were ( top , from left ) : @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 ; and ( bottom from left ) : @entity192 , mullah @entity193 he faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy			1
a former platoon - mate of @entity11 told @entity199 that @entity11 is trying to win a public - relations battle with new claims about his defense strategy			2
@entity203 reported based on a @entity205 leak , that @entity11 told @entity1 investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report ' a breakdown in discipline and order ' to military higher - ups â€“ not with desertion in mind			1
' this is clearly just a stunt to build sympathy before they go to trial , ' said retired sgt. @entity218 , who spoke for the first time since the @entity1 announced @entity11 would be court - martialed			0
' no logical person would ever take the actions he undertook for the reasons he is now saying , ' @entity218 told @entity199			0
he said the claim broadcast by @entity203 is ' ridiculous , ' and that the @entity1 's decision to charge @entity11 with desertion is ' in direct conflict ' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle - blower			1
@entity203 reported that a @entity205 official said @entity11 had ' concerns about leadership issues at his base			0
' he needs to be held responsible for what he did , for abandoning his post , for abandoning his platoon , for putting thousands of @entity117 soldiers , @entity238 and the whole @entity117 military , thousands of members , in more danger , putting us into spots we would n't already have been in , had he not walked away , ' he said			0
president @entity244 announced the return of @entity11 on may 31 , 2014 in a @entity247 press event as the soldier 's parents @entity250 ( left ) and @entity251 ( right ) looked on @entity218 also noted that his decision ' cost the @entity117 multiple soldiers ' lives , five @entity255 , and the incredible monetary expense of searching for him			2
' however , both @entity257 and @entity258 , who have left the @entity1 , stopped short of demanding that @entity260 face prison			0
' i do n't want to ruin his life , ' said @entity258			0
' he does need to be dishonorably discharged , have all his ranks taken away , and he does not need to receive any benefits or back pay			0
' he added that he was proud the military had reached its decision despite the fact it would heap further pressure on the @entity244 administration for negotiating with the @entity4 over a man accused of deserting			2
' you ca n't get around the fact this makes some people look bad , ' he said			0
but they had little sympathy for @entity260 's account of being beaten and tortured during his time in @entity4 captivity			2
' he would n't have been put in that position , he would n't have been tortured , he would n't have been put through all that hardship if he 'd never walked away , ' said @entity257			0
the punishments suggested by the veterans are within the range open to the court			0
it can reduce him to @entity288 1 , forfeit his pay and give him a dishonorable discharge .			0
