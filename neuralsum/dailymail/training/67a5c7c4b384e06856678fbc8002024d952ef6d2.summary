from a human ear , to perfectly functioning valves , 3d printers are already being used in medicine , but now scientists in the @entity5 are attempting to build a whole human heart using the versatile piece of kit			2
their ultimate goal is to create a new heart for a patient using their own cells that could be transplanted			2
it is an ambitious project to first make a heart and then get it to work in a patient and it could be years - perhaps decades - before a 3d printed heart would be put in a person in a standard operating theatre			2
learning by heart : scientists could create a new heart for a patient using a 3d printer and their own cells			2
the organ could be created in just three to five years time and be transplanted in a human within the next decade			1

the finished product would be called the ‘ bioficial heart ’ - a blend of the natural and artificial			1
the heart may be built from cells taken from the patient 's fat			0
but plenty of difficulties remain , including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed			0
patients in the operating theatre would have some fat tissue removed and regenerative cells isolated			0
the cells would then be mixed with solutions and placed in the bioprinter , which prints the heart			0
the new organ would then be transplanted in another operation			0
the technology , though , is not all that futuristic			0
researchers have already used 3d printers to make splints , valves and even a human ear			0
so far , the @entity60 in @entity61 has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells , said @entity65 , a cell biologist leading the ambitious project			1
they have also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals and professor @entity65 believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years			1
the finished product would be called the ‘ bioficial heart ’ - a blend of the natural and artificial			1
the biggest challenge is to get the cells to work together as they do in a normal heart , said professor @entity65 , who heads the project at the @entity81 , which is a partnership between the university and @entity84 in @entity60			1
a tricky operation : an organ built from a patient 's cells could solve the rejection problem some patients have with donor organs			1
if everything goes according to plan , professor @entity65 says the heart might be tested in humans in less than a decade			1

professor @entity65 , of the @entity81 , believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years			1
the 3d printer uses a mixture of a gel and living cells to gradually build the shape of a blood vessel – and one day a heart			2
the idea is that eventually , the cells would grow together to form the tissue			0
in the future it could take just three hours to print the whole structure of the heart			2
an organ built from a patient 's cells could solve the rejection problem some patients have with donor organs or an artificial heart and it could eliminate the need for anti-rejection drugs , he said			1
if everything goes according to plan , professor @entity65 believes the heart could be tested in humans in less than a decade			1
the first patients would most likely be those with failing hearts who are not candidates for artificial ones , including children whose chests are too small for an artificial organ			1
professor @entity65 said the heart he envisaged would be built from cells taken from the patient 's fat			0
but plenty of difficulties remain , including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed			0
dr @entity159 , whose team at @entity161 in @entity162 is using 3d printers to attempt to make a human kidney , said : ‘ with complex organs such as the kidney and heart , a major challenge is being able to provide the structure with enough oxygen to survive until it can integrate with the body ’			1
the @entity174 approach is not the only strategy researchers are investigating to build a heart out of a patient 's own cells			0
elsewhere , scientists are exploring the idea of putting the cells into a mould			0
scientists have already created rodent hearts that beat in the laboratory and some simple body parts made using this method have already been implanted in people , including bladders and windpipes			1
mending hearts : professor @entity65 said that the heart ( a model is pictured ) is the easiest organ to print because it is made up of so few cells and only has one major function - to contract or beat the 3d printer works in much the same way an inkjet printer does , with a needle that squirts material in a predetermined pattern			1
the cells would be purified in a machine and then printing would begin in sections , using a computer model to build the heart layer by layer			0
professor @entity65 ' printer uses a mixture of a gel and living cells to gradually build the shape			0
the idea is that eventually , the cells would grow together to form the tissue			0
at the moment , the printer is focused on replicating parts of the heart , but in the future it could print the whole structure in less than three hours , professor @entity65 told @entity224			2
however , the largest blood vessels and valves will need to be printed and assembled separately			1
‘ final construction will then be achieved by bioprinting and strategic placement of the valves and big vessels , he added			2
the technology has already helped in other areas of medicine , including creating sure - fitting prosthetics and a splint that was printed to keep a sick child 's airway open			2
doctors at @entity240 used a 3d printer last year to create an ear with living cells .			0

scientists from the @entity81 in @entity60 , @entity61 , are able to print parts of hearts including blood vessels
they think it will be possible to print an entire heart in three to five years ' time and for it to be tested in humans in less than a decade
the finished product would be called the ‘ bioficial heart ’ - a blend of the natural and artificial
@entity263 hearts are *desirable* as they could solve the rejection problem some patients have with donor organs or an artificial heart
