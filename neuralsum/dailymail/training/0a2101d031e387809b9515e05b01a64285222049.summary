@entity0 says that the presence of @entity2 makes him a better player – and believes he has the same effect on his @entity6 team - mate			1
the pair are currently sidelined because of injury and @entity6 have struggled amid their absence			0
last season they scored 38 top - flight goals between them as the @entity15 sauntered to the @entity17 title			1
' we realise that we are stronger when we are playing together , as a partnership , ' the @entity29 told @entity32 magazine			1
' you are always stronger , in any sport , in life , when you are doing stuff together			2
with a player of @entity2 ’s calibre , we can go from strength to strength , and we can become even better			1
' one game he will score a couple , the next game i will score a couple			0
it is important that this partnership is becoming even stronger			0
' struggles : both players have suffered with injury this season and @entity6 have endured a poor start @entity22 believes that he and @entity2 boast a ' rare ' quality			1
' in a way we are both " nine - and - a - halves " , because we can play high up front and we can drop , ' he went on			1
' that is an extra quality we have , which is quite rare			1
if you look around you have loads of main strikers , target men , foxes - in - the - boxes , and you have no 10s who are dropping in more			2
' with us it ’s not obvious because we can both do that job			0
@entity2 is doing a bit more , because he is playing behind me , but we can both do it			1
' the ultimate goal : the pair 's strikes brought a league title to @entity75 last season meanwhile , @entity22 has revealed that some words of wisdom from @entity80 legend and former @entity82 manager @entity79 helped to sharpen his focus in front of goal			1
' the way he ( @entity22 ) looked at football was ice cold , ' reflected @entity22			0
' i remember a game against @entity91 and i hit the bar , the post twice and one chance went just by it , and we lost that game			0
' i went to play for @entity82 and he asked me : “ how was your game ? ” i said : “ yes , actually quite good			2
” then he said : “ how was your game ? ” i said : “ yes actually not bad			0
i was a bit unlucky , but i think i played well			0
i hit the post and the bar ... ” ' he said : “ no , no , @entity0 , it ’s not good enough			2
you need to make sure that you score those goals , that they do n’t hit the post or the bar , and you should not be happy if it hits the bar or the post , because the bar or the post is not a goal			0
so , no it was not good			0
i watched the game and you ’ve got to change your mentality of looking at those situations			0
” ' he opened my mind , because he was right			0
' ice cold : @entity79 changed @entity22 's mentality by saying that the striker should not be pleased with hitting the woodwork advice : @entity22 , now @entity118 boss , managed @entity22 at international level @entity22 and @entity6 return to @entity122 action next month when they face @entity123 in the last 16			1
the @entity125 - born star was just 11 when he watched @entity126 lift the trophy in 1995 courtesy of @entity130 's toe poke against @entity80			1
@entity22 says that is one of the goals he wishes he had scored			2
' it was n’t beautiful but it changed his life , ' he said , ' he was 17 or 18 at the time , it was an unbelievable stage to score such an ugly , important goal which won them the @entity122			1
one wish : @entity22 says @entity130 's winning goal in the 1995 @entity122 final against @entity80 was the one he wishes he 'd scored ' @entity145 ’s goal last year , it was very special , to do it in the 89th minute , it ’s a dream come true , and i was really happy for him when i saw that			1
' he deserved that , he ’s worked so hard over the years , he ’s had some ups and downs , he is a great player			2
to enjoy a moment like that , to score the winner in a @entity122 final in the 89th minute , that ’s dream stuff			1
' and , of course , @entity158 ’s volley against @entity159 in 2002			0
that was a beautiful one as well			0
' the @entity162 interview : the @entity29 on the cover of @entity166 champions magazine read the full interview in the latest edition of @entity169 magazine , out this week			2

@entity0 says @entity2 makes him a better player
@entity29 has the same effect on the @entity175 striker
they both have a ' rare ' quality as ' nine - and - a - halves '
advice from former @entity82 manager @entity79 changed his life
hitman wishes he 'd scored @entity130 's winner in the 1995 @entity122 final
