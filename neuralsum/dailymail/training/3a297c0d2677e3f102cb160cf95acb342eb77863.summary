the local government secretary called for ‘ bin - tidy ’ spaces to be built into the front of houses and flats , or for space to be made available for bins in the back yard			1
building and planning regulations will demand that housing designers include space for ‘ proper waste storage ’ in new properties , mr @entity1 said			1
his bid to reduce ‘ bin blight ’ is the latest attempt to soften the impact of a @entity29 - driven move towards compulsory recycling			1
millions of homes have been issued with wheelie bins , often in areas where there is nowhere to store them			2
mr @entity1 said he was ‘ getting rid of barmy bin policies which made families ’ lives hell			1
’ he added : ‘ i want to make sure families get a proper rubbish and recycling collection service for the large amount of money they have to pay in council tax			0
‘ thanks to ill - thought out town hall policies from the last government , badly - placed wheelie bins and the proliferation of multiple bins have created a blot on the landscape			2
‘ in streets up and down the country , ugly bin clutter has ruined the street scene and the look of people ’s homes and gardens			0
by ensuring that developers create appropriate waste storage areas when designing new homes , we can tackle the ghastly gauntlet of bin - blighted streets and driveways			1
’ mr @entity1 , who once said it was the basic right of an @entity69 to put chicken tikka masala in his bin without having to wait a fortnight for it to be collected , was the driving force behind a £ 250million fund to encourage councils to bring back weekly rubbish collections			2
research has shown the initiative failed to restore weekly bin rounds , but did support councils that had chosen to keep them			0
millions of homes have been issued with wheelie bins , often in areas where there is nowhere to store them the @entity86 has published new clauses for planning and design guidance which say every new home should have space for all the bins demanded by the local council			0
a consultation on housing standards to be published next week will say : ‘ the government places a high degree of importance in ensuring that suitable provision is made for waste storage in new homes , particularly to avoid bins dominating street frontages or contributing to increased levels of anti-social nuisance such as odour or litter			0
‘ this is sometimes referred to as bin blight , and the government intends to bring this to an end			0
’ the @entity111 said this week the average amount recycled by individuals in @entity69 fell for the first time in 30 years last year .			0
