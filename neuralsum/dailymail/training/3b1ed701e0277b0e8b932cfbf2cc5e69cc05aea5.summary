the language of love has gone digital through text messages and social media – and it 's even affecting the way we flirt			1
research has found we are more likely to poke someone on @entity8 than ask them out on a date			2
and the poll revealed that the reason for the trend is that 38 per cent find chatting to someone we fancy too embarrassing			2
technology is leading to people shunning the direct approach for less bold ways of telling a potential date that they are interested with many opting for a @entity8 poke rather than asking someone out for a drink the poll was commissioned by online comparison site broadbandchoices.co.uk who surveyed 2,000 @entity27 adults			1
almost one in five people said they mostly use private @entity8 messages to communicate while dating , while others thought a phone call or text message was more forward than a face - to - face chat			1
just over a quarter said they opt for @entity34 when trying to impress someone they like			1
researchers from @entity38 recently found that relationships may suffer because hi - tech communications can lead to couples ' disconnecting ' with each other on serious issues			0
' the bottom line is that if you do n’t have something nice to text , better not text at all , ' concluded the report			0
the report found that for women , using text messages to apologise , work out differences or make decisions was associated with a more unhappy relationship			0
for men , very frequent texting was associated with a poor relationship			0
however , both men and women agreed that expressing affection via text enhanced a relationship			0
while 50 per cent of people are confident enough to ask someone for a date face - to - face , a third confessed they would be too embarrassed or nervous to pick up the phone and call a love interest			1
however , the poll also revealed modern technology does have its downside when it comes to flirting			0
one in seven people admitted they had accidentally sent a ' naughty ' message to the wrong person - with more than a fifth of red - faced flirters sending it to a parent , while one in 10 admitted sent it to the ' wrong ' partner			0
brits can be sheepish when it comes to ending relationships too with one in eight owning up to dumping a partner by text , while one in 20 ( five per cent ) said they had sent a private @entity8 message , and a brutal three per cent admitted posting a public break - up message on @entity8			1
behavioural psychologist @entity89 said : ' if you 're confident and looking for something fun and casual over the @entity94 season , @entity90 and @entity34 are great places to start			1
' if you want something potentially a little more meaningful - or do n't want to reveal , or see , anything naughty - stick with text messages or @entity8			1
' if you want someone to know that you mean serious business and you 're prepared to be bold , pick up the phone			2
' it shows real effort and confidence - and could lead to a festive fumble			0
' old fashion approaches like talking face - to - face or even picking up a telephone appear to be a dying art as people prefer to hide behind technology when asking out a potential date for a drink a quarter of people use @entity34 to impress a potential date rather than talking to them face to face , however , using technology can backfire when users send naughty messages to a parent or another partner by mistake even when in relationships , @entity82 are self - conscious with more than half the people polled ( 53 per cent ) saying they would n't have ' in a relationship ' on their @entity8 profile after six months of being together , with almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) citing the reason as feeling they had n't been together long enough			1
a further seven per cent even said they felt a year was n't long enough to announce their relationship on @entity8			2
@entity132 , telecoms expert at broadbandchoices.co.uk , said : ' digital dating and social media have only been around for a relatively short time but it is fascinating to see how they have altered the way we interact with one another , particularly for people seeking new relationships			0
' all that online interaction can eat through your mobile data , so make sure you have a plan with enough of a download allowance to avoid any untimely interruptions to your service			0
