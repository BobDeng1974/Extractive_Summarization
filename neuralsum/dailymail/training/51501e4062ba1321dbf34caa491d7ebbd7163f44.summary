by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:36 est , 4 december 2013 overall , humans are becoming increasingly carnivorous , but there are decreases in meat consumption in certain countries , the study said across the globe , humans are eating increasing quantities of meat			1
the change to an increasingly carnivorous diet is driven by the fast - growing economics of @entity16 and @entity17 , scientists have said			0
@entity19 researchers have discovered ‘ significant ’ links between the @entity22 ’s development indicators and the food humans eat in different countries , to draw relationships between socio - economic , environmental and health conditions and changing dietary patterns			1
overall , humans might be becoming increasingly carnivorous , but the study also found we can not be considered apex predators			2
the research , which was published in @entity35 , examines what people eat in different countries and claims to be the first study to calculate the trophic level of humans – a measurement in ecology that reveals our place in the food chain			1
plants and algae are at trophic level one , as they create their own food , while herbivores are level two and animals which eat herbivores are at level three			1
carnivores that eat smaller carnivores are at trophic level four , while carnivores with few predators , such as polar bears or lions , occupy level five			1
@entity61 , a fisheries scientist at the @entity62 in @entity63 , who led the research , said humanity ’s median trophic level was approximately 2.21 in 2009			1
she told nature : ‘ we are closer to herbivore than carnivore			0
it changes the perception of being top predator			0
’ in the study , the scientists used the @entity77 ' @entity79 's data on 102 different foods to calculate humans ' trophic levels for 176 countries each year from the 1961 to 2009 one - plants and algae , which create their own food			1
two - @entity86 such as rabbits ... and humans , which the study said have an average trophic level of 2.21 in 2009			1
three - animals that eat herbivores , including foxes			0
four - carnivores that eat smaller carnivores , such as cod that eat fish			0
five - carnivores with few predators , such as polar bears or lions			0
as well as determining the trophic level of humanity , the study examines how people ’s eating habits have change			1
to do this , the scientists used the @entity77 ’ @entity79 ’s data on 102 different foods to calculate humans ’ trophic levels for 176 countries each year from the 1961 to 2009			2
they discovered that over the 50 year period , humans increased their consumption of fat and meat to move higher up the food chain , by 3 per cent or 0.06			2
while this might seem like a small change , an environmental scientist commenting on the study believes it is deceptively large			0
@entity125 of @entity126 in @entity127 told the publication that because a creature ’s trophic level is calculated by the sum of the trophic levels of food it consumes , a change of 0.1 means a predator near the top of the food chain – including humans – are actually consuming considerably more meat			1
people in @entity16 and @entity17 , who have traditionally eaten a lot of rice - based dishes , are becoming gradually wealthier as their countries have enjoyed a period of economic growth and have therefore seen ' marked increases ' in their trophic levels as they eat more meat			2
meat kebabs on sale at a stall in @entity152 are pictured however , people in different countries are becoming more or less carnivorous			0
the scientists said : ‘ we show that , although countries have diverse diets , there are just five major groups of countries with similar dietary trends			0
’ people in @entity16 and @entity17 , who have traditionally eaten a lot of rice - based dishes , are becoming gradually wealthier as their countries have enjoyed a period of economic growth and have therefore seen ‘ marked increases ’ in their trophic levels as they eat more meat			2
however , in places including @entity169 and @entity170 , where people have traditionally eaten a diet heavy on meat , fish and dairy , other food groups are now easier to obtain and the people living there are eating slightly less meat than before			0
the researchers believe their study will help scientists better understand the human impact on resource and energy consumption , which is especially important as the impact of producing meat is much larger than that of growing vegetables			0
dr @entity61 warned that if humans increase our trophic level , we will ‘ start to have a bigger impact on ecosystems '			2
@entity61 , a fisheries scientist at the @entity62 in @entity63 , said humanity 's median trophic level was approximately 2.21 in 2009 , putting it closer to the trophic level of herbivores like rabbits , than carnivores			1
' it changes the perception of being top predator , ' she said			0

@entity19 researchers have discovered ‘ significant ’ links between the @entity22 ’s development indicators and the food humans eat
a scientist from the @entity62 estimated humanity ’s median trophic level was approximately 2.21 in 2009
the study found that overall , humans are closer to herbivores than carnivores but are eating more meat than 50 years *ago*
