campaigning : the prime minister on a tour of @entity2 in @entity3 yesterday two senior conservatives tipped as potential successors to @entity6 have broken ranks to insist @entity8 should not fear an exit from the @entity10			1
@entity12 mayor @entity11 insisted a @entity8 exit – or ‘ @entity14 ’ – ‘ would n’t be disastrous ’ , while culture secretary @entity15 , a rising @entity16 star , said it was ‘ not something anyone should be frightened of ’			1
a @entity16 pledge to give people their first say on @entity8 ’s place in @entity24 for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop @entity24 human rights judges interfering in @entity8 law – will be central to the party ’s pitch ahead of may ’s general election			2
both mr @entity11 and mr @entity15 have backed the prime minister ’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with @entity34 before holding an in / out referendum by the end of 2017			1
however , they went further than mr @entity6 on the possibility of an exit , insisting @entity8 could prosper outside the @entity10			2
in an interview with @entity41 , mr @entity11 said : ‘ i think @entity14 is possible ... [ @entity8 ] would very rapidly come to an alternative arrangement that protected our basic trading interests			1
' i must be clear			0
i think there would be a pretty testy , scratchy period ... [ but ] it would n’t be disastrous			0
’ the @entity12 mayor , who is bidding to return to @entity49 at the election , also declared himself ‘ definitely ’ a social liberal			1
dismissing the concerns of some right - wing @entity16 mps over mr @entity6 ’s decision to legalise gay marriage , mr @entity11 said : ‘ i ca n’t see what the fuss is about			1
’ mr @entity15 , a protege of chancellor @entity58 , said on the question of @entity8 ’s @entity10 membership : ‘ my faith is in the @entity8 people			1
if they decide that , taking into account the renegotiation , they want to continue that relationship with the @entity10 , of course that ’s something everyone would accept			2
‘ but if they decide to end that relationship then that is not something anyone should be frightened of			0
’ the @entity15 told political magazine @entity75 there were ‘ some significant changes we rightly want to see in our relationship with the @entity10 ’			1
‘ that ’s the whole point of having the negotiation followed by a referendum			0
i think the in / out referendum is the exact thing that concentrates the minds of your @entity24 partners			0
‘ if you have n’t got that then why would they seriously consider anything you want to change ? and when that referendum takes place , clearly whether we are in or out is rightly a decision for the @entity8 people			2
it ’s something the @entity8 people have wanted a say on for many years			0
’ looking for an exit ? @entity11 broke ranks to say pulling out of the @entity10 would not be disastrous he also suggested @entity16 mps should be free to campaign on either side of the debate			1
‘ we ’ve already seen in this @entity103 , in all parties , that when it comes to issues that are really important to people … mps ultimately , they have a relationship with their constituents and they will decide which way it is they want to campaign , ’ mr @entity15 said			1
‘ but this is something the @entity16 is united on : we must get a renegotiation and we must put that to the @entity8 people in a referendum			2
’ culture secretary @entity15 said the @entity8 people deserve to have their say and should be respected as well as underlining his pledge to hold an @entity10 referendum , mr @entity6 is expected to detail @entity16 plans to curtail the role of the controversial @entity124 in the @entity8			1
he is expected to pledge to scrap @entity126 ’s @entity125 and replace it with a @entity8 @entity127			2
mr @entity6 will promise to establish pre-eminence for @entity8 ’s @entity103 and @entity129 , allowing them to over-ride @entity132 rulings			0
the @entity133 , which is enshrined in @entity8 law by the @entity125 , has become increasingly unpopular with most conservatives			0
critics say the @entity132 court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention			0
the @entity124 has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation , who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights			0
@entity16 grandee @entity149 , a staunch @entity150 , said an @entity10 referendum could bring about the collapse of the @entity8			1
he told @entity153 : ‘ it is only just dawning on people that if we have a referendum [ on the @entity10 ] and the @entity159 vote to leave and the @entity160 vote to stay , then i think that that will be the end of the @entity8			2
i do n’t want to see the end of the @entity8			0
’ his comments came as a survey revealed that more voters now believe the @entity8 ’s closest ties should be with the @entity10 ( 30 per cent ) than with the @entity167 ( 25 per cent )			0
it is the first time @entity24 has come out on top since the survey by respected international think - tank @entity171 was first conducted in 2010 .			0

@entity12 mayor and the culture secretary @entity15 both broke ranks
mr @entity11 : ' it would *n't* be disastrous ' . mr @entity15 : ' people want their say '
*tories* expected to put @entity10 referendum pledge at heart of may *manifesto*
