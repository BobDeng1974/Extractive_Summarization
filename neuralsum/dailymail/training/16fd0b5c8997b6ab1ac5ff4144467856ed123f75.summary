by @entity0 published : 02:47 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 04:52 est , 21 may 2012 @entity1 has given the green light to a new generation of @entity5 nuclear submarines , pitching the coalition into civil war over the future of @entity10 ’s deterrent			1
the @entity11 will next week reveal the names of defence firms who have won £ 350million of contracts to design the new super subs			2
the decision means the @entity10 is set to replace the four giant @entity19 class boats with a new @entity21 class of submarines , rather than downgrade the deterrent as the @entity24 want			1
making waves : @entity1 has given the go - ahead to a new generation of nuclear submarines to replace the current @entity19 class of boats , which includes @entity19 ( above ) the successor submarines are due to come into service in 2028			1
and the design of the new submarines will use a new nuclear propulsion system to make the next generation of boats longer lasting and more cost effective			2
a senior government source said : ‘ this is an important step towards renewing our nation ’s nuclear deterrent into the 2060s			0
‘ the contracts which will be awarded to @entity10 companies will also sustain and create 1900 jobs in the @entity10 ’s world - class submarine - building industry			0
‘ the @entity49 has been operating continuous at sea deterrent patrols for more than 40 years and the @entity52 submarines will allow us to do so well into the future with cutting edge equipment			0
’ face - off : mr @entity1 's decision pitches him into a civil war with @entity58 's ( left ) @entity24 , who want to abandon a key @entity61 doctrine in order to justify a cut - price nuclear deterrent details of the deals were revealed as @entity1 attended the @entity67 summit in @entity68 , where he was set to argue that the alliance needs to get smarter about defence with budgets tight			1
but his decision to press ahead with a full blown replacement for @entity5 puts him on a collision course with his coalition partners			0
it emerged last week that the @entity24 want to abandon a key @entity61 doctrine in order to justify a cut price nuclear deterrent			1
former leader sir @entity80 , a close ally of @entity58 , said the @entity10 should scrap the so - called @entity81 , which has governed nuclear policy for 40 years			0
since the 1970s , it has dictated that the @entity10 must possess the nuclear capability to overwhelm @entity86 ’s air defences and destroy its government and military command centre			0
changing enemies : the test - firing of a @entity5 missile			0
the @entity24 want the focus on containing the nuclear threat from smaller states like @entity95 , on the basis that the @entity10 would never fight a nuclear war with @entity98 or @entity99 without the @entity100 @entity102 officials are considering whether the @entity10 ’s deterrent threat should instead be based on the ability to inflict unacceptable damage on a foe by wiping out smaller cities or military facilities			1
they want the doctrine tweaked to focus on containing the nuclear threat from smaller states like @entity95 , on the basis that the @entity10 would never fight a nuclear war with @entity98 or @entity99 without the @entity100			0
the @entity24 believe the @entity10 should scrap plans for a new generation of subs and instead adapt the existing , smaller and cheaper @entity116 class boats to carry nuclear tipped missiles			1
@entity24 armed forces minister @entity120 has begun a review of the options inside the @entity11 on the options for a cut price deterrent			2
observers believe could lead to the @entity24 entering the next election with a pledge to scrap the nuclear deterrent altogether .			2

@entity1 green light to new generation of nuclear subs
@entity24 wanted downgrade to *reflect* end of @entity61
