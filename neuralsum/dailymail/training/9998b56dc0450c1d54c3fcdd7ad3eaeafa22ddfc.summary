by @entity0 @entity2 would guarantee patients an appointment with a family doctor within 48 hours - and within a day in urgent cases , @entity1 announced yesterday			1
he called it a ‘ scandal ’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a gp , and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times			1
but doctors warned against a ‘ knee jerk ’ return to the 48 hour target , which was in force under the last @entity2 government , saying it would increase the burden on overstretched gps			1
@entity1 visited @entity22 in @entity23 today before announcing that under @entity2 voters would get a guarantee to see their gp within 48 hours mr @entity1 claimed the £ 100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on @entity28 red tape and highly - paid consultants			1
the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80pc to 40pc under the @entity33 , he said			1
one in four people have to wait a week to be seen			0
the @entity2 leader said his ‘ guarantee ’ would prevent patients who can not get an appointment with their gp flooding @entity39 departments and would save the @entity28 more than £ 300million			1
‘ this will be better for patients , because they have better access to their gp surgery ; better for the @entity28 , because it will save money currently spent in @entity39 ; and better for @entity48 , because it is the kind of health service we need ’ , he said			2
the conservatives called it an ‘ unfunded pie in the sky policy ’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care			1
mr @entity1 told an audience in @entity61 that @entity2 would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse , rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway			1
if their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a gp the same day			0
all patients would have the right to see a gp at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to , although not necessarily the gp of their choice			2
@entity1 has hit out at the government 's ' scandalous ' @entity28 reforms , which he claims are costing millions of pounds			2
he wants to scrap the changes to fund more gp appointments @entity77 at the @entity78 said last year when this policy as suggested that ‘ arbitrary targets , even for limited periods , are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the @entity28 and could make the situation worse			2
he added : ‘ it is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm gp services and restrict the freedom of @entity21 to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long - term conditions			2
’ dr @entity93 , chair of the @entity94 , has also warned against a ‘ knee jerk ’ return to 48 - hour targets , but welcomed the promise of extra funding to cut waiting times			0
she said family doctors regularly see up to 60 patients a day , with the majority of @entity21 now saying that they fear missing something serious in a patient due to unsafe workloads			1
‘ gps want to provide better access for their patients			0
we support the aspiration that patients should be able to book a @entity12 appointment within 48 hours , as one of a range of options that also includes , for example , the ability to wait for longer to see a gp of their choice ’ , she said			0
‘ but the way to achieve this is not the imposition of top - down targets , but tackling the resourcing crisis that is at the root of the rising waiting times affecting general practice			0
’ she added : ‘ while we welcome mr @entity1 ’s announcement it must not be another ‘ sticking plaster ’ solution but part of a broader , long - term , shift in investment ’			0
labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target , as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own gp will still be able to			2
gps can spend the extra funding as they see fit , by hiring more staff or asking @entity21 to work longer hours			0
the cost would be funded by cutting £ 78million of administration and legal fees associated with @entity151 competition law , and reining in the £ 3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – monitor , the @entity156 and @entity157			0
mr @entity1 also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the @entity160 – the law putting gps back in charge of health budgets			0
a conservative health spokesman said : ‘ this is an unfunded pie - in - the - sky policy that @entity2 ca n't pay for and doctors ca n't deliver			1
more unfunded spending would mean more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it			0
‘ the last @entity172 vandalised the relationship between gps and their patients by introducing tick - box targets and scrapping family doctors , something we are now putting right			1
‘ far from improving access , another top - down target will leave @entity21 less time with their patients and put more pressure on general practice			0
