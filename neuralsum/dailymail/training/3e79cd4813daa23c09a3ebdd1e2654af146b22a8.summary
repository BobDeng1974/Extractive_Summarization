it was a scene of horror that has scarred their minds for decades			0
but now , in their nineties , seven @entity5 prisoners of war have returned to @entity8 , where they were starved and forced into manual labor for four grueling years			0
the @entity12 camp , which was built on a superficial island between @entity14 and @entity15 in 1941 , is now a boat racing venue surrounded by office buildings			1
today , however , it played host to a small group of men who know the true horrors that took place in that spot			0
remembering : @entity5 veterans ( left to right ) @entity26 , 93 , @entity27 , 96 , and @entity28 , 99 , stand together in front of the @entity31 statue built over the @entity8 camp where they were held prisoners @entity35 , 96 , was one of thousands of men put to work unloading cargo for hours			0
they would work through the night with just a small bowl of rice for food			2
but in those hungry times , they also were among the luckiest , he claims			2
' [ it ] was great work because we had a lot of opportunities to pinch food			2
we learned real quick , ' said @entity27 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , who watched as @entity5 fire bombs incinerated nearby neighborhoods			0
@entity27 joined six of his comrades invited to visit the camp - now known as @entity59 - by the @entity12 government			1
amazed , he told @entity14 's @entity66 how much the country has changed : ' all this land you see was reclaimed by us , the @entity5 prisoners of the war and the @entity64 prisoners of the war , ' @entity27 said			2
' and i am amazed at how well they have used the land			0
' changed : @entity27 can still remember feeling so hungry he would steal food while unloading cargo every single one of the prisoners could still vividly remember their hunger almost 70 years ago			1
' in four years , i never had a good meal ' , said @entity28 , 99 , of @entity80 , @entity53			0
@entity28 was a civil engineering graduate of the @entity81 when he enlisted in the @entity82 in 1940			0
taken prisoner in @entity84 , he spent much of his imprisonment at the @entity86 , a ' showcase ' camp on western @entity12 's @entity89 island			1
' i arrived two days ago and had my first good meal ever in @entity12			1
' like the other former pows , @entity28 marveled at @entity14 's progress since @entity12 's surrender in august 1945 , especially high - tech toilets equipped to warm , wash and dry			1
' i sat down on a toilet seat and it was warm ! ' @entity97 , 93 , of @entity98 , @entity99 , was working in construction on @entity101 in the @entity102 when the @entity12 took the island in 1941 , capturing 5,000 prisoners			1
by the time the war ended , he had been moved to @entity106 and then to an open pit iron mine in northern @entity12			1
peace - making : the seven veterans were invited to the built - over site by the @entity12 government ' but also i was young and had set myself a goal to live , that i was going to live regardless , ' @entity112 said			1
during the war , the @entity12 held over 30,000 allied force members as prisoners in dozens of camps in @entity12 , @entity118 and elsewhere in @entity119 , according to the @entity120			2
the former pows said they understood that the cruelty and brutality they experienced during the war had much to do with the times			0
one of 91 - year - old @entity127 's most vivid memories is of a supervisor in the prison camp at @entity130 , a copper smelting center in western @entity12 , who did not retaliate when @entity127 and another prisoner stole his lunch			1
' he came the next day with two lunches , ' one for you , and one for me , '' said @entity127 , of @entity139 , @entity140			0
' if he had reported me , i would n't have been speaking to you tonight			0
