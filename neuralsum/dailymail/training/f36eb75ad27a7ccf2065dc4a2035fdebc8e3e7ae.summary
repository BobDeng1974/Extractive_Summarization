by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 13:16 est , 20 january 2014 usually when thieves are caught carrying out their crimes , they are said to be caught red handed , but not this adventurous pickpocket in @entity6			1
instead of using his fingers to grab this man 's smartphone from his pocket , he is instead filmed using a pair of chopsticks			1
but unfortunately for him his skills do n't seem to be up to the task as he quickly drops the mobile , causing the unsuspecting victim to turn around and foil the crime			1
as the unsuspecting victims moves to lean on a wall the pickpocket has no choice but to follow beside him			2
he is nearly discovered when the victim moves his arm and almost touches the thief 's hand			0
undeterred the man keeps tugging at the phone , but is forced to abandon the attempt after the phone owner turns his head , hiding the sticks under a hat he is carrying to avoid detection and leaving the mobile hanging tantalisingly out of reach			2
but he is soon back at it , and after a few more pulls he manages to get the mobile in his grasp , and tries to quickly put it into the hat to avoid getting fingerprints on it			0
as the phone owner moves to the right of the picture the thief follows him with the sticks in his pocket the thief risks detection with his determined efforts to take the man 's mobile away from him he eventually manages to get the handset , but while trying to slip it into this hat he drops it but he tries to do it too quickly , and at the last second drops the handset on to the floor , causing a noise which the victim obviously hears as he suddenly turns around			1
for a moment the two men stand frozen , as the victim can hardly believe he is looking at his own phone on the floor			0
the less - than - master thief pats down his pockets , perhaps trying to pretend that the phone is his , before walking away once the victim has gone in for a closer look			2
as the mobile falls to the floor the criminal pats his pockets , as if tying to pretend it was his phone it is not the first time a chopstick thief has been caught picking pockets in the country			0
back in april last year @entity110 , 32 , was snapped lifting the phone from a woman ’s pocket as she cycled through @entity114 , the capital of central @entity6 ’s @entity116 province			1
photographs show him running after the unsuspecting cyclist along a busy road			0
the pictures were posted online and after national news coverage , @entity110 handed himself in to the police .			0
