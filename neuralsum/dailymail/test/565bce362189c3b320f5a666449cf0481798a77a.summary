since 2013 , dr @entity0 has been trying to convince the scientific community that he has found aliens in @entity4 's stratosphere			1
now the controversial @entity6 professor claims he has new evidence of these ' extra-terrestrial organisms ' floating 25 miles ( 40km ) above the planet			1
he says the organisms test positive for dna , and have masses that are ' six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from @entity4 to this height			1
' dr @entity0 has been trying to convince academics that he has found aliens in @entity4 's stratosphere for several years			1
pictured are one of the so - called ' ghost particles ' that the researcher claims to be proof of extraterrestrial life forms			2
his views have been widely dismissed by the scientific community the organisms , he claims , are contained in a microscopic metal globe designed by an intelligent species to ' seed ' alien life on @entity4			1
dr @entity0 announced the discovery in an email to his students at @entity36 , who posted it on @entity39			1
' we sent balloons and a sampler and found no pollen or grass , nothing up there to contaminate , it was completely pristine , ' dr @entity0 told @entity48 at @entity49			1
' for these reasons , we think [ the organisms ] are coming from space , ' he added			2
' all the time when you walk outside , you are being pelted with organisms that come from space			2
' he said that his latest discoveries has been accepted in the journal @entity60			0
dr @entity0 ( right ) claims he has new evidence of these ' extra-terrestrial organisms ' floating 25 miles ( 40km ) above the planet			1
he says the organisms test positive for dna , and have masses that are ' six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from @entity4 to this height ' dr @entity0 's research has been widely criticised by the scientific community as being backed by poor and flimsy evidence			1
' the critics claim that the samples we obtained must have come from @entity4 , that it that there must be a mechanism which can lift these particles from @entity4 to the stratosphere , ' dr @entity0 told @entity80			1
@entity81 is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe , hitchhiking on comets or meteorites			0
for example , life such as extremophiles , capable of surviving the inhospitable conditions of space , could become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			0
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets			0
the idea of directed panspermia , however , suggests that lifeforms are deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilizations professor @entity107 , one of the biologists who discovered the structure of dna , examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973			1
however , professor @entity107 and his ccolleagues concluded that the scientific evidence was ' inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability '			2
' however , we have provided evidence that the dna - containing masses , plus other strange organisms we have isolated are not associated with pollen , grass and fungal spores on our sampler			2
' if our organisms came from @entity4 they must be contaminated with common @entity4 organisms and they are not			1
' ' we will probably not be believed until @entity131 repeats our findings , ' he added			0
' i suspect that @entity131 they will then try and take the credit by claiming that their methods were somehow more sterile or precise			0
' earlier this year , the astrobiologist revealed an image of what he said was a tiny metal ball spewing out a ' gooey ' substance in samples gathered by a balloon in the @entity4 's stratosphere			1
dr @entity0 said the ball , which is about the width of a human hair , could be an example of directed panspermia			1
this describes the belief that life was deliberately sent to @entity4 by some unknown extraterrestrial civilisation			2
he argued that the strange material coming from the titanium ball is biological and could in fact be a colony of tiny microorganisms			0
however , he conceded it is virtually impossible to prove that the tiny sphere was sent by aliens from outer space			0
dr @entity0 said the sphere made a tiny ' impact crater ' on the sampler that was attached to the balloon as it collected dust and particles in the atmosphere			1
he added : ' the sphere made an impact crater on the sampling stub			0
this proves beyond doubt that the particle was travelling at speed from space when it was sampled			0
' dr @entity0 and his team discovered the sphere when examining samples of dust and particulate matter collected by a balloon sent around 16 miles into the atmosphere			1
the metal sphere found by @entity186 and his colleagues ( above ) appears to be oozing goo from its side using x-ray analysis to examine the sphere , he concluded that it was made from titanium and traces of vanadium , while the material appearing to come out of the side was biological			0
they found that it also had a ' fungus - like knitted mat - like covering '			0
dr @entity0 and his colleagues have published their findings in the @entity201 but their conclusions have yet to be corroborated by other scientists			1
the journal often publishes papers on astrobiology but is highly controversial among scientists as it has been criticised for its peer review process and for publishing papers of a fringe variety			0
two years ago it controversially published a paper that claimed to have identified fossils of microbiotic life in a meteorite , sparking a blaze of publicity , but was also met with a great deal of skepticism			0
the idea that life can survive high the @entity4 's atmosphere , however , is not new			2
scientists working with @entity131 recently discovered bacteria living up to five miles above the @entity4 's surface			1
however , most scientists believe they are likely to have been carried up from @entity4 rather than having an extraterrestrial origin			2
air currents and winds are known to be capable of carrying dust and bacteria for hundreds of miles and high into the atmosphere			2
but research has shown that microorganisms can survive the intense heat and pressures of entering the @entity4 's atmosphere from space , raising the prospect that life may have originally been carried here			1
some astrobiologists believe life started on @entity4 after being carried here on a comet or asteroid , while others believe it is more likely that the basic chemical building blocks were carried in this way rather than established life			2
however , the idea of directed panspermia has been proposed by some heavyweight scientists			0
professor @entity107 , one of the team who one a @entity254 for discovering the structure of dna , examined whether it was possible that organisms could have been deliberately transmitted to the @entity4 by intelligent beings from another planet			1
dr @entity0 used balloons similar to this one above to collect samples from the stratsophere he eventually concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support such a claim			1
dr @entity0 , however , insists his findings may help to provide some of that evidence			1
' unless of course we can find details of the civilisation that is supposed to have sent it in this respect it is probably an unprovable theory , ' he added			0
professor @entity275 , an astrobiologist at the university of @entity277 and editor of the @entity201 , said : ' i think more work needs to be done on this particular structure , for example to study its dna , if it has any			0
' but already there is clear proof from many directions to confirm that we are constantly bombarded by fragments of comets that carry living microorganisms			0
' @entity289 , author of the @entity290 , said the idea that such material were being sent out by aliens attempting to seed other planets was a ' leap of the imagination '			0
he said : ' this would seem to provide proof that outer space and not just the surface of our planet is teaming with life			0
' i 'm sceptical about this and we would need to collect more samples like this to have a better idea of where it originates from			2
' it is a leap of the imagination that it came from an @entity314 race trying to seed our planet with their biological constructs			0
' perhaps there are luminous or ' invisible ' jelly - fish like creatures that inhabit our skies , or microorganisms flooding our planet , i 'm not convinced , but they are fascinating ideas that make a change from stories of starships loaded with aliens			0

*radical* claim made by dr @entity0 from @entity36
he used balloons to collect dust samples 25 miles ( 40km ) above @entity4
claims to have discovered ' alien organisms ' that test positive for dna
his research has been widely criticised by the scientific community
