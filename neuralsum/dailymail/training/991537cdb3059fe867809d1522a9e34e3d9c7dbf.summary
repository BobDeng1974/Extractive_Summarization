by @entity0 climate - changing microbes , known as @entity2 , may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history the worst mass extinction in @entity7 's history - long before dinosaurs roamed the planet - was caused by microbes , according to a new study			1
the tiny organisms suddenly began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide - some 250 million years ago			1
fumes spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species , from snails and small crustaceans to early forms of lizards and amphibians in less than 20,000 years			1
the ' @entity23 ' occurred more than 252 million years ago - long before dinosaurs lived roamed @entity7 - at the end of @entity27 era			1
in the past asteroids , volcanoes and raging coal fires have been blamed but the finger is now being pointed at tiny microbes called @entity2			2
these spewed enormous amounts of methane into the atmosphere , dramatically altering the climate and the chemistry of the oceans			1
unable to adapt in time , countless species perished and vanished from the @entity7			2
alarmingly , the same effects are starting to happen today as a result of global warming caused by carbon emissions			0
analysis of geological carbon deposits reveals a significant boost in levels of carbon - containing gases - either carbon dioxide or methane - at the time of the mass extinction			2
the @entity27 extinction , which occurred around 250 million years ago , was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct			1
pictured is the fossil skull of @entity61 , which did not survive the @entity27 extinction the @entity27 extinction , which occurred around 250 million years ago , was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct			1
until now , the causes that triggered the collapse of the @entity27 period have remained a mystery			2
some scientists have suggested extinction was caused by an asteroid strike or a volcanic eruption in an area , what is now called @entity74			0
they claim this led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and caused the mass extinction of the @entity7 's species			0
new research , however , suggests that microbes began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide			1
fumes suddenly spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species			1
but volcanic eruptions alone could never have produced the amount of carbon laid down in rock sediments during this period , the researchers claim			0
' a rapid initial injection of carbon dioxide from a volcano would be followed by a gradual decrease , ' said @entity98 scientist dr @entity97 , from the @entity99 ( @entity99 )			0
' instead , we see the opposite : a rapid , continuing increase			0
' that suggests a microbial expansion			0
the growth of microbial populations is among the few phenomena capable of increasing carbon production exponentially , or even faster			0
' a timely combination of two factors may have sent @entity2 into overdrive , according to the findings reported in the journal @entity114			0
first , a genetic change allowed it to become a major producer of methane from accumulations of carbon dioxide in the oceans			2
second , a surge in volcanic activity led to a sudden influx of nickel , a vital nutrient that helped the microbes proliferate .			0
