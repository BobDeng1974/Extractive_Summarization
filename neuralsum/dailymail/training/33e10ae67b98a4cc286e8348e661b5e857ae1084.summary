by @entity0 last updated at 8:50 am on 2nd february 2012 for 642 days , the residents have camped out to prevent the spread of an illegal traveller camp on the edge of their village			1
but now the vigilant villagers of @entity8 are being thrown off their protest camp – while the travellers remain			1
planning officials ruled that the residents ’ rudimentary shelter of caravan , tarpaulin and wood - burning stove constituted an illegal development and must be dismantled			1
fighting spirit : the villagers ' protest camp in the village of @entity8 , @entity22			1
now the group face eviction themselves after being told their camp is illegal but the town hall has so far failed to move on the travellers , despite the rejection of their planning application			1
the decision was last night condemned by the residents of the @entity22 village , who branded the move by @entity36 ’s planning committee a ‘ disgrace ’			2
they warned the illegal traveller site was in danger of becoming @entity41 – a reference to the mass illegal occupation in @entity44 , @entity45 , which only ended after a multi-million pound , decade - long planning row			1
invasion : the illegal travellers ' encampment			2
the site has been turned into a quagmire the @entity8 travellers paid £ 100,000 to buy a paddock from a local businessman and , in time - honoured fashion , moved on to the land at the start of a bank holiday weekend in april last year – when the council was powerless to stop them developing the site			1
but they had not reckoned on the determination of villagers to preserve the @entity65 greenbelt which separates the village from @entity67 and @entity68			0
as word spread , residents swung into action , descending on the eight - acre site and forming a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening			1
ever since , around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further , working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight			1
only last week they succeeded in preventing another eight lorry loads of hardcore from being deposited at the site			2
but like their foes , the residents did not have planning permission for the camp – which stands on a builders ’ yard driveway immediately opposite the gypsy settlement – and , last night , the @entity89 - run authority voted to issue an enforcement against it			2
planners ordered them to remove the stove , caravan and tarpaulin by march 31 , even though the owner of the builders ’ yard has given them full permission to remain there			0
around 80 villagers and members of the residents ’ group @entity109 ( @entity113 ) packed into a meeting last night at the council house to hear the decision			2
protest : villagers attend a council meeting where councillors on the @entity89 - run @entity36 ruled that the protesters encampament was illegal and despite the eviction order , they remained upbeat , chanting ‘ we shall not be moved ’ outside the building			1
they vowed to continued their protest and face the elements with no shelter or warmth			0
@entity109 spokesman @entity131 said : ‘ we are bitterly disappointed that councils have voted to evict residents			0
‘ we are the people who have prevented hundreds of tonnes of hardcore being dropped on our otherwise unspoilt countryside			0
we are the people who have alerted the council to subsequent breaches of the injunction they imposed on the gypsies			0
@entity145 blockade : residents man their encampment at the site taken over by gypsies on december 25 moving in : travellers build their camp on the site in @entity8 , @entity22 , as they set - up in may 2010 - despite a blockade being set up ‘ they have admitted we have a valuable role to play in monitoring the site but then decide to kick us off			1
it ’s a disgrace that the planning system finds it easy to enforce against law - abiding tax - payers but seems to become paralysed when it comes to taking action against travellers and gypsies			0
’ mr @entity131 , a training consultant who lives yards from both camps , said the group would comply with the order but will ‘ sit in the rain if necessary to maintain our vigil ’ and urged the council to ‘ speed up ’ enforcement action against the travellers			0
he said the group had the right to appeal the council ’s decision , but would not on cost grounds			0
traveller takeover : the group invade the greenbelt site in april 2010 - while the council are powerless to act the gypsies lodged a retrospective planning application after moving on to the site , which was turned down by the local authority			1
in october , @entity186 , the secretary of state for communities and local government , upheld a planning inspector ’s recommendation that the appeal should be dismissed			0
the gypsies will remain on the site until at least next month , the earliest date the council could obtain a @entity195 hearing to apply for an injunction to remove them from site			0
@entity109 also lost an appeal against the council ’s decision to refuse them retrospective planning permission for their own camp , triggering last night ’s enforcement action			0
last night , around ten caravans remained on the gypsy site			0
the once - lush paddock has now been turned into a muddy quagmire caused by the gypsies ' 4x4 vehicles repeatedly entering and leaving the site .			2
