by @entity0 created 11:53 am on 8th november 2011 in a landmark ruling , the @entity1 faces having to pay millions to sex abuse victims after the court ruled it could be liable for priests ' crimes			1
the woman claims she was assaulted by father @entity8 during two years at @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity11 , which has now closed , after being sent there with her three siblings			1
she said the priest would sexually assault her as ‘ punishment ’ for misbehaviour , adding : ‘ the nuns knew			2
he was allowed to take any child and rape them			1
it was always my fault			2
he would even make me give money afterwards , tuppence in the poor box			2
he said @entity25 had told him to do it			2
’ ruling : the decision by the @entity28 could have far - reaching implications for the church			1
it is subject to appeal the woman known as @entity34 was at the @entity37 children 's home for two years from age six to eight between may 1970 and may 1972			1
the following are among the claims she has made : @entity34 , as she was referred to in court , never spoke of what happened until she was contacted by police investigating abuse allegations at the home			1
‘ i did n’t tell anyone , ’ she said , ‘ even one of my siblings who i found out later had also been sexually assaulted			2
’ in the landmark ruling , mr @entity53 said the @entity1 can be held responsible for the sins of its clergy because of the ‘ immense power ’ it gave them			0
his judgment could lead to thousands of claims by people in @entity64 and @entity65 who say they were sexually abused by priests , perhaps decades earlier			1
it also means the @entity1 may be held to account for other criminal acts by priests			0
in the test case yesterday , mr @entity53 found that the behaviour of @entity72 , who died in 2006			1
was the @entity1 ’s responsibility			0
the decision means the victim can sue the @entity76 , @entity77			1
the @entity1 told the court it should not be answerable for wrongdoing by @entity72 because it did not employ him			0
lawyers for the @entity82 , led by lord @entity83 , said priests were not paid by the diocese , nor could they be disciplined or sacked by the bishop			0
they lived on money from the collection plate and a priest could not even be made to change his job without agreeing			0
but mr @entity53 said : ‘ father @entity8 was appointed by and on behalf of the defendants			1
‘ he was provided with the premises , the pulpit and the clerical robes			0
' he was directed into the community with that full authority and was given free rein to act as a representative of the @entity1			0
' he had been trained and ordained for that purpose			0
he had immense power handed to him by the defendants			0
' it was their empowerment of the priest which materially increased the risk of sexual assault , the granting of the power to exploit and misuse the trust which the defendants had granted to him			0
’ the diocese refused to comment but is expected to appeal			1
@entity115 , of the victim support group minister and @entity116 , said she was relieved by the ruling , adding : ‘ we hope it opens the way for the settlement of many hundreds of cases pending in courts			0
’ the @entity1 has been trying for a decade to end scandals over sexual abuse by priests , and is set to publish a report today on abuse at a school in @entity130 , @entity131 .			2

case could have wide - reaching implications for alleged church child abuse victims
@entity137 , *47* , claims she was repeatedly raped by father @entity8 when she was a child
decision is still subject to appeal
