by @entity1 reporter published : 11:23 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 13:32 est , 10 december 2013 @entity3 ’ liver transplant surgeon is under renewed ethical scrutiny after it was revealed he lived in the billionaire ’s @entity6 recovery home for two years while @entity3 ’ attorney paid the bills			1
dr. @entity10 moved into @entity3 ’ recovery home soon after performing his surgery in 2009 and then purchased it for himself in 2011 shortly before his patient ’s death			1
@entity10 has batted off questions about his relationship with @entity3 before — and about how the @entity20 billionaire so quickly snagged a precious organ in @entity22 — but these new revelations have put the ethical spotlight back on the renowned transplant surgeon			1
scrutiny : dr. @entity10 helped extend @entity3 ' life by over two years with a 2009 liver transplant , but the surgeon 's friendship with the billionaire is under renewed scrutiny years later ‘ it strikes me as a potential conflict of interest , ’ @entity33 bioethicist @entity32 told @entity6 ’s @entity34			1
‘ it strikes me as straining ethical credulity to have him there saying , “ well , you know , i just lived here			0
and this guy just chose to pay my rent			0
" ’ a call made to @entity10 's office was forwarded to @entity46 , a spokesperson for @entity47 , the hospital where @entity48 works			2
' we do n't have anything to add at this time , ' was @entity46 's only comment on a story he said has already been covered at length			0
however , @entity46 declined to comment on behalf of @entity10 or the hospital as to whether the surgeon was paying rent over the course of the two years he lived in the 13 - room home			1
meanwhile , it seems clear that he did not personally pay the utility bills or property taxes during those years			1
the home was owned by a limited liability company set up by jobs ’ attorneys			0
the bills were paid for personally by @entity3 ’ @entity68 lawyer @entity67			1
according to the @entity69 , @entity67 used his credit card to pay $ 8,770 in utility bills for the home between may 2010 and 2011			1
@entity67 wrote personal checks amounting to $ 23,585 for property taxes on the home between 2009 and may 2011			2
recovery house : this 13 - room @entity6 home is again at the center of debate about @entity10 , who has now been revealed to have lived in the home for two years while @entity3 ' attorney paid some of the bills that ’s when @entity10 purchased the home for $ 850,000 , the same price jobs paid in 2009			1
while appearing before a meeting of the @entity88 for an unrelated matter , @entity10 was asked how he came to purchase the home			2
‘ it ’s a fair question , ’ @entity10 said			2
‘ when i learned that it was going to be going on the market , i asked the administrator of the llc if i could purchase it			0
’ but his succinct answer failed to address the years he ’d lived in the home before purchasing it			2
it also glossed over the years of bioethical intrigue that followed @entity3 ’ transplant			2
according to the @entity34 , @entity10 was going through a divorce when he moved into the home part - time in 2009 while also trying to patch things up with his wife			2
' close friend ' : following his transplant , @entity3 recovered in the @entity6 home			1
some question @entity10 's relationship with @entity3 -- who quickly got a new liver after being listed at @entity48 's @entity22 hospital -- now that its been revealed that @entity10 also lived there multiple listing is when a transplant patient lists his or her name at multiple hospitals			1
the method allows patients to be eligible for organs in areas outside the regions where they live			0
hospitals tend to look at factors like bank accounts , home life , and support systems when deciding who gets precious organs			0
this means that mostly just wealthy individuals are able to qualify for transplant lists outside where they live			0
@entity3 had enough money to buy a home in @entity6 in which to recover and to quickly fly there when a liver became available			1
' and then , in 2010 , sometime in spring of 2010 , i moved in there and stayed there until i purchased the house			0
and live there now , ' @entity10 said			0
while most @entity149 waiting for transplants do so near their homes and families , those patients with more money and mobility are able to cast a far greater net when searching for an organ			0
the process is called multiple listing and it gives patients — who are rich more often than not — a greatly increased chance to get a life - saving transplant			0
because he had the means to travel and be taken care of outside of his @entity20 residence , hospitals outside his place of residence were willing to place him on their transplant lists			2
while @entity3 may have died waiting for a liver in densely populated @entity20 , where many were ahead of him on the transplant list , he quickly made it to the front of the line in less populous @entity22			1
@entity10 has addressed @entity3 ’ luck in the past			1
‘ he was the top person on that list that day , because he was the sickest person on the list that day , ’ @entity10 said in a statement shortly after news of @entity3 ’ transplant emerged in 2009			1
while ethicists and sick patients without @entity3 ’ money may question the fairness of multiple listing , it is legal			0
and other patients of dr. @entity10 ’s might question his relationship with @entity3			1
according to the @entity34 , the doctor went above and beyond the typical level of care offered to most patients : coordinating his recovery and continued cancer tests , pain treatment , and nutrition			0
@entity10 even reportedly ran errands for @entity3 and took him on walks in the park			1
while such intimacy has lent itself to questions about possible preferential treatment given to the billionaire , for his part @entity10 says they were just friends			2
‘ we developed a close friendship			0
and we treated each other like you would do any other friend , ’ @entity10 told the @entity34			0
‘ he was a friend helping me out			0
and i was , you know , looking after the house for him			0

dr. @entity10 has been questioned about the ethics involved in *securing* the @entity20 billionaire a liver in @entity22
@entity10 personally saw to much of @entity3 ' *post-surgical* care
@entity10 is under renewed fire because he lived in the @entity6 home for two years while @entity3 ' lawyer paid the taxes and utility bills
@entity10 has since purchased the $ 850,000 home
