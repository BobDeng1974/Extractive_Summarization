@entity0 attracted the ‘ wrong people ’ to support @entity1 , a key ally of @entity3 claimed last night			1
in an extraordinary intervention , @entity5 said the record election victories won by @entity1 were ‘ too big ’ , and had forced the party to pander to the middle classes while in government in order to keep their support			1
mr @entity5 , a former adviser to @entity14 , is chairman of @entity1 ’s @entity15 , which backed mr @entity3 in the leadership battle with his @entity18 brother @entity17			1
his remarks came as the same website yesterday published an article by shadow chancellor @entity31 in which he claimed that @entity1 was again in the ‘ centre ground ’ of @entity34 politics			2
in mr @entity5 ’s open letter to mr @entity0 he said the ‘ problem ’ was epitomised by the defeat of @entity38 @entity37 in 1997			1
‘ oh , how we cheered later that morning , ’ he said			0
‘ but in hindsight the wrong people were voting @entity1			0
the tent was too big and you spent the next ten years trying to keep the wrong people in it – the very rich , for example			0
what meaningful project includes everyone ? ’ the comments follow a warning from mr @entity0 that @entity1 was on course to lose the election because @entity3 , pictured , had dragged his party too far left mr @entity5 said @entity1 ’s 1997 majority was ’ too big ’ , adding : ‘ you remark , almost with pride , that the population has n’t shifted to the @entity58 – well , what exactly was your job as a political leader supposed to be about then ? ‘ had you not been so disdainful about anything remotely old @entity1 there would probably be much less support for @entity27 now			1
’ the comments follow a warning from mr @entity0 that @entity1 was on course to lose the election because mr @entity3 had dragged his party too far left			1
mr @entity0 later withdrew his remarks , saying he had been misinterpreted			0
mr @entity5 ’s diatribe came under immediate attack			2
former minister @entity72 joked that mr @entity5 sometimes appeared to be ‘ an agent sent to discredit the @entity58 ’			0
and former @entity1 adviser @entity74 said : ‘ here ’s my prediction for 2015 – the wrong people voting @entity1 will not be a problem for @entity3			2
’ in his claim to the ‘ centre ground ’ , mr @entity31 said it was now the @entity81 who were adopting an ‘ extreme and ideological ’ approach by pledging to clear @entity34 ’s deficit through cuts , rather than tax rises			0
vowing to also cut the deficit , he said : ‘ last month ’s @entity88 was the day chancellor @entity89 ceded the political centre ground to @entity1			0

@entity3 ally @entity5 said @entity1 victories were ' too big '
claimed it forced the party to pander to the middle classes while in power
argued @entity0 ’s approach had squeezed @entity1 voters ’ needs
but @entity0 warned lurch to the left will mean @entity1 will lose the election
