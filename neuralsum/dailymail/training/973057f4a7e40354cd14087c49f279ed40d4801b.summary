many people are guilty of oversharing on @entity1 , but even the most reserved users may be giving away more about their personality than they realise			1
by ‘ mining ’ for likes on the social network , software has been developed that can accurately predict how open , conscientious , outgoing and neurotic an individual user is			2
and , in the majority of cases , these predictions were found to be more accurate than those made by close friends and family			0
using this data , the @entity16 has created an online test that lets you see what your @entity1 profile is revealing about you			1
users will need to connect the test to their @entity1 account , but it only accesses likes and does not post to their wall during tests , only a spouse 's judgement rivalled the computer ’s ability to sum up broad psychological traits			1
the research , and online test , were created by phd student @entity33 from @entity16 ’s @entity34			2
in addition to predicting a user 's personality , the test estimates a user 's age , relationship status , intelligence levels , life satisfaction , political and religious beliefs , and education			0
to collect the data , ms @entity60 's team asked 86,220 @entity1 users to complete a 100 - item personality questionnaire , designed to provide personality scores for traits including openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism			1
as part of the process , the members also allowed the researchers to access and analyse which pages on @entity1 they had liked			2

and , in the majority of cases , these predictions were found to be more accurate than those made by close friends and family analysis of this data revealed which likes equated with higher levels of particular traits			1
for instance , liking @entity101 , @entity104 talks , or pages about meditation revealed a high degree of openness			1
people with higher levels of extraversion commonly liked reality tv star @entity112 , and pages about dancing			2
researchers previously asked 86,220 @entity1 users to complete a 100 - item personality questionnaire			1
this was designed to provide personality scores for traits including openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism			1
analysis of the data revealed which likes equated with higher levels of particular traits			1
the results of the computerised character assessment were then compared with judgements of friends and family members made using a shorter version of the personality test			2
given enough likes , the software was able to match people ’s self - reported personality traits more closely than siblings , parents or friends			1
in particular , the researchers found their software could to predict a participant ’s personality more accurately than a work colleague from analysing just 10 likes			1
inputting 70 likes allowed it to obtain a truer picture of someone ’s character than a friend or room - mate , while 150 likes outperformed a parent or sibling			0
it took 300 likes before the programme was able to judge character better than a spouse , though			0

given that an average @entity1 user has about 227 likes , the researchers said this kind of artificial intelligence ( @entity189 ) has the potential to know us better than our closest companions			0
‘ in the future , computers could be able to infer our psychological traits and react accordingly , leading to the emergence of emotionally - intelligent and socially skilled machines , ’ said ms @entity60			0
‘ in this context , the human - computer interactions depicted in science fiction films such as her seem to be within our reach			0
’ in her , starring @entity205 , a man develops a close relationship with an intelligent computer operating system called @entity209 , personified by a female voice			0
but the scientists admit there may be concerns about privacy as such technology develops , and say they support policies giving users full control over their digital footprint			0

it took 300 likes before the software could judge character better than a spouse , though the work , reported in the journal @entity254 , builds on a previous study by @entity16 scientists which showed that a variety of psychological and demographic characteristics can be predicted through @entity249			2
co-author dr @entity259 , also from @entity16 , added : ‘ the ability to judge personality is an essential component of social living - from day - to - day decisions to long - term plans such as whom to marry , trust , hire , or elect as president			0
‘ the results of such data analysis can be very useful in aiding people when making decisions			0
’ people with higher levels of extraversion commonly liked reality tv star @entity112 ( pictured ) , and pages about dancing , according to the research			2

‘ people may choose to augment their own intuitions and judgments with this kind of data analysis when making important life decisions such as choosing activities , career paths , or even romantic partners			0
‘ such data - driven decisions may well improve people ’s lives			0

more than 86,220 @entity1 users completed a personality questionnaire
results provided scores for openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism
as part of the study , the users also allowed their likes to be analysed
analysis revealed which likes equated with higher levels of certain traits
for instance , liking @entity101 and meditation makes you more open
software was then able to predict personalities more accurately than siblings , parents , friends and work colleagues
@entity16 has created a test to let you analyse your profile
