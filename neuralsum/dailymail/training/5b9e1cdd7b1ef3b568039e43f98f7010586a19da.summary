by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 18:31 est , 28 february 2013 the number of children identified with learning difficulties in @entity5 is five times the @entity7 average because schools too often classify under - performing pupils as having special educational needs , it was claimed last night			1
a fifth of pupils , or 1.6million , have been identified as having special educational needs ( @entity14 )			1
they represent 19.8 per cent of the school population , compared with an @entity18 average of 4 per cent , according to an analysis of @entity20 figures from 29 countries			1
the statistics are revealed in a book from the @entity25 chain of academies and the @entity28 think - tank which claims youngsters are being routinely over-classified as having sen. education secretary @entity31 criticised schools for using the ' special education needs ' label as an excuse for under - performance , insisting there was no reason why a child with visual impairment or deafness could not do well at school			1
picture posed by models this ‘ special needs inflation ’ is contributing to a worrying ‘ tail of underachievement ’ in the country ’s schools that is letting down thousands of pupils			1
the book , the tail : how @entity5 ’s schools fail one child in five – and what can be done , was publicly endorsed by education secretary @entity31 this week			0
he criticised schools for using the @entity14 label as an excuse for under - performance , insisting there was no reason why a child with visual impairment or deafness could not do well at school			1
@entity68 , chairman of @entity25 , which runs academies in @entity70 and @entity71 , said : ‘ there would need to be something very wrong with the water for @entity5 to have five times the special needs of our @entity7 peers			2
‘ the true explanation lies in a system of skewed incentives which encourages schools to over-classify children			0
’ the book , the tail : how @entity5 's @entity85 , was publicly endorsed by education secretary @entity31 ( above ) this week @entity86 , its director of education , said many schools ‘ have reached too readily for the @entity14 label when faced with pupil underachievement ’			0
she added that this approach is ‘ perpetuating a culture of low expectations which has too often trapped children in the tail of low attainment ’			0
league table performance measures scrapped by the @entity97 meant schools could boost their rankings by having higher numbers of @entity14 children			0
but miss @entity86 said there was still a ‘ perverse incentive ’ for schools to over-identify @entity14 to prove they were improving the average attainment of these pupils compared with their non-sen peers during @entity109 inspections			1
@entity109 should instead focus on a school ’s success in improving the progress of low attainers and moving children off the @entity14 register			2
schools – particularly those in disadvantaged areas – should also be acknowledged in @entity109 judgements for using the @entity14 label ‘ sparingly ’			0
she added : ‘ this requires a cultural shift away from locating all issues around low attainment in the child and asking hard but honest questions about how much of it is due to poor teaching			0
’ in 2010 , @entity109 found that around 450,000 children would not be identified as having @entity14 if schools focused on improving teaching and learning for all			2
in some schools , a ‘ culture of excuses ’ meant pupils making slow progress were automatically classed as having @entity14 , the education watchdog warned			2
@entity138 , the government ’s former speech and language tsar , has also said a special needs diagnosis could be ‘ used as an explanation for failure ’ .			0
