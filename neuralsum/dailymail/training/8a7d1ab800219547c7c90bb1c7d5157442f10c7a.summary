by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 18:10 est , 15 october 2013 the glare of the setting sun during rush hour is to blame for 36 deaths a year , a report from the @entity2 warns today			1
the danger is particularly high now as autumn turns to winter and the sun sets at around 6pm – just as most drivers are heading for home			1
it plays a part in nearly 3,000 accidents every year with drivers at risk of being temporarily ‘ blinded ’ by the dazzle of the sun on the windscreen			1
the glare from sunset is to blame for 36 deaths a year , the @entity2 report reveals			1
posed by models the @entity2 says the risk will continue until @entity24 ends on october 27 , when the clocks go back			2
the biggest danger is on minor roads			0
the @entity2 report says that of the 2,905 accidents in which sun dazzle was reported to be a factor last year , 52 happened on motorways , 1,203 on a-roads , 428 on b - roads and 1,222 on other minor roads			1
@entity2 president @entity35 said most drivers were sensible enough to slow down when they are dazzled			1
‘ but where a dazzling sunset gets particularly nasty is when the road turns unexpectedly into it or the glare appears from behind trees or buildings or by reflection , ’ he said			2
‘ drivers ca n’t gamble that it will change quickly – in the couple of hundred yards that takes to happen , there may be a pedestrian , cyclist or jogger			0
‘ likewise , overtaking into low sunlight when the road ahead is obscured is risking disaster			0
’ the @entity2 also points out that the rate of head - on crashes involving lorries nearly quadruples in twilight conditions			2
‘ if the vehicle casts a long shadow in front of it , it is very likely that oncoming drivers and those coming out of turnings will have difficulty seeing it , ’ says the report			0
the @entity2 says that the danger of sunset coinciding with the rush hour poses different challengers for different road users			2
it urges drivers to ‘ watch the backs ’ of joggers , dog walkers and pedestrians as these groups are almost twice as likely to be killed or seriously injured in road accidents if they have their backs to the vehicles			0
the @entity2 says its own research based on official 2004 pedestrian casualty statistics , shows that 10.8 per cent of the 5,566 pedestrians killed or seriously injured when in the road were walking or running with their backs turned away from the traffic			0
this compares with 5.9 per cent of casualties who were directly facing oncoming cars .			0
