preparing for the threat of invasion , corporal @entity0 would often encourage his fellow @entity4 soldiers not to panic			2
but members of the real - life @entity6 are thought to be behind the discovery of a rifle in a bell tower that has excited churchgoers			1
they uncovered this immaculate @entity13 rifle and box of live ammunition hidden under floorboards and then buried in sawdust			1
this is the gun and box of live ammunition that was found hidden in the bell tower at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 @entity24 in the spot in the bell tower where the ' immaculate ' rifle and ammunition was discovered @entity28 was fitting new frames for the church bells when he unearthed the weapon and a box of 20 live ammunition cartridges			1
' i found a message on my phone from @entity28 to say he had found something , ' said @entity24 , @entity38 captain			2
' so i dashed over there			0
' ' none of the bellringers would tell me anything when i arrived at the tower , they just asked me to go right up the spiral staircase to the bellchamber			0
' that is where i met @entity28 and he showed me the rifle			0
we were just so surprised at what we had found			0
' the discovery was made by @entity28 , pictured above , under the floorboards in the bell tower during a revamp ms @entity24 added : ' the mystery remains as to how and why it got there in the first place			1
' one assumes it must have been a bellringer in order to have had access to that part of the tower			0
' there have been various suggestions , possibly a rogue @entity13 bellringer who did not want to return his weapon at the end of the war , or maybe the tower was used as a look - out by the home guard and then , for some reason , it was left there			1
' perhaps we will never know			0
' the rifle was taken away by the police to be made safe and it is hoped that it will return to the church			2
