mrs @entity32 , 28 , said : ' i received a telephone call from a vet in @entity48 who said they had a border terrier who looked exactly like @entity13			1
' they said he was fine and had been running around a nearby field playing with a @entity63 , when a lady noticed him and took him to the vet			2
' i drove down there straight away and collected him and we only just brought him home earlier this evening			0
' he has been begging for treats ever since			2
' the family said their three - legged rescue dog , @entity74 , had been pining for @entity13 ever since he went missing the dog was taken to this vet surgery in @entity48 after being found playing on a nearby field			1
the surgery then called @entity9 , who went to pick him up mrs @entity32 , pictured spent £ 4,000 in a desperate bid to get her dog back , and even filmed a reconstruction of the moment the dog was snatched @entity13 , a pedigree animal , slipped out of the front door when @entity9 was distracted by her six - month - old daughter , @entity29			1
a local boy found the terrier and , suspecting he was lost , put him on a lead and started knocking on doors looking for the owner			2

@entity13 , who was wearing a green suede collar , has not been seen since			0
the man was aged between 40 and 50 , with a bald or shaved head			0
he had a young boy sitting beside him in the car ’s front passenger seat mrs @entity32 , a vet , spent £ 4,000 in her campaign to find her border terrier , missing for three weeks			1
a family have filmed a @entity43 - style reconstruction of the alleged dognapping of their beloved pet			1
the film shows a youth hand the dog to a driver , who offered to take it to a vet			0
the dog has not been seen since a reconstruction of the moment @entity13 went missing in @entity10 has taken place in a bid to jog people 's memory there were leaflets — 10,000 of them — and a campaign on social media , and a firm of pet detectives			1
at the weekend she staged a @entity43 – style re-enactment of his theft to jog memories , and spent £ 650 to fly a banner appealing for information about her pet behind an aircraft circling her home town of @entity10			1

i would have spent £ 10,000 if it meant getting him back			0
the family even paid for a plane to fly over @entity10 with a banner in a bid to raise awareness of their search as well as putting up posters , mrs @entity32 made video appeals and took to social media in a bid to find @entity13 she added : ' every time i see him now i just ca n't believe he is back			1
i was always hopeful he would come back but as the weeks went on it looked less likely			0
' he is definitely getting to sleep upstairs in the bed with us tonight			0
he is n't normally allowed but my husband said if we got him back he could so i am holding him to that ! ' this week , campaigners at the @entity168 called for anyone convicted of stealing a dog to be jailed for at least six weeks , after reports of the crime increased by more than a third over the past two years			0
in particular , ‘ theft by finding ’ is said to be on the rise — where people who claim to have innocently come across a dog demand money for its return			0
from april 2016 , all dogs will be required to have an identification microchip inserted under the skin , partly to combat such crimes			0
but already these chips are being removed by thieves			0
despite the huge scale of efforts to find the dog , the animal has not been handed into vets and remains lost @entity190 and @entity191 take a break from putting up posters in @entity10 to help find missing dog @entity13 and chat to the pet 's owner @entity32			1
