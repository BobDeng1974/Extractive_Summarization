@entity0 is fighting to keep his place in @entity3 's starting line - up as the @entity5 champions embark on a critical week in their season			1
the @entity8 goalkeeper conceded a soft winner against @entity10 in @entity3 's last game and manager @entity12 is considering giving no 2 @entity13 a chance against @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17 over the course of the next eight days			1
@entity19 , a £ 6million summer signing from @entity12 's old club @entity21 , has not played since letting in three goals against saturday 's opponents @entity15 in the @entity24 last month			1
' i 'm waiting for my chance			0
i am training very well and maybe it could be the next game or maybe it could be another game – but i am ready			0
' competition between goalkeepers is always good			0
when i spoke to the coach about coming to @entity3 , he told me it would be a good opportunity for me			0
but he said i would have to work so hard to play because everyone knows that @entity0 is a brilliant goalkeeper and a fantastic person too			1
@entity0 has helped me so much since i came here			2
' @entity12 axed @entity0 for seven @entity5 games towards the end of last year and played @entity54 instead			1
but the @entity3 boss kept his cards close to his chest on friday , saying : ' we 'll see game by game			0
one hour and 15 minutes before kick - off you will know which goalkeeper starts			0
@entity13 was speaking at @entity63 which is an interactive gang awareness project @entity3 's @entity65 gets involved with local children at the club event defender @entity65 shows he 's not afraid to help educating schoolchildren in the @entity70 area ' @entity13 can be in any team , he 's a very good goalkeeper			2
in this moment i 'm playing @entity0 , but he will have his opportunity soon			1
' @entity13 has a good career behind him			2
if you want to be a top goalkeeper you must have all the attributes – good distribution , to know when to go for the ball , to be good one - on - one , to not concede early goals			0
' it 's important to have competition in every position in the team , not just with @entity0 and @entity13			1
' @entity0 was criticised for allowing @entity87 's low shot to go under his body when @entity10 won 1 - 0 at the @entity89 , but @entity12 insisted that @entity19 's prospects do not hinge on his rival 's errors			1
' i am not waiting for @entity0 to make a first mistake to change him for @entity13 , ' said @entity12			1
' maybe in the last year @entity0 did n't start very well but he finished very well			2
' i analyse the goals and individual mistakes with the players , the whole team			0
i think a lot of players were involved in [ conceding ] that goal			0
' @entity13 was speaking at ' @entity63 ' , an interactive gang awareness project organised by the club 's foundation to educate local schoolchildren about the negative effects of gang and crime culture .			0
