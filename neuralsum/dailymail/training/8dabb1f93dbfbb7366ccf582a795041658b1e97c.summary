a space saving toilet with a foldable bowl has been designed by @entity9 students to make the humble loo more efficient			1
the @entity12 concept has a clever flush system that works when the toilet is moved into an upright position and saves water			1
a space saving toilet with a foldable bowl has been designed by @entity9 students to make the humble loo more efficient			1
it works because the folding toilet bowl contains a built - in u bend that disengages from the waste pipe when in the seated position @entity12 works because the folding toilet bowl contains a built - in u bend that disengages from the waste pipe when in the seated position			1
when the flush mechanism is activated by folding the toilet into its upright position , the u bend re-engages simultaneously			1
an air - tight seal ensures that waste stays where it should be			0
an internal frame supports the bowl using a sliding hinge mechanism and a nylon roller			0
the hinge mechanism keeps the toilet straight , while the roller takes the weight of the user and transfers it through the frame to the floor			2
designed by @entity42 and @entity43 who are students at the @entity45 , @entity12 takes up a third of the space of a standard toilet when it is folded in the upright position and not being used			1
the foldable loo is more efficient than standard toilets too as it uses just two - and - a - half litres of water per flush , compared to six litres for an average toilet			1

the foldable concept toilet is more efficient than standard toilets too as it uses just two - and - a - half litres of water per flush because of its innovative design , compared to six litres for an average toilet @entity12 takes up a third of the space of a standard toilet when it is folded in the upright position ( illustrated ) while the toilet is currently just a concept , mr @entity42 and mr @entity43 have submitted a patent application for their design and are looking to sell the idea			1
the duo reckon their innovation could save 10,000 litres per person , per year , in typical use			0
their @entity12 design has been entered into @entity94 ( @entity95 ) student @entity98 competition			0
the competition challenges students to change the toilet and make it more environmentally friendly			0
‘ ordinary toilets have many problems - one is an excessive use of water which is created by large volumes of water used to force waste around the water trap to leave clean water in the trap , ’ mr @entity42 and mr @entity43 explained			2
‘ the current conventional toilet is also very big , thus impacting greatly on small bathrooms			0
‘ in order to solve these problems , a mechanism has been created to allow the bowl to be folded away			0
‘ @entity12 is an ingenious solution using considerably less water than a standard toilet , it has a remarkably small footprint when folded in the upright position and thanks to its rimless design it is much easier to keep the bowl clean , ’ they added			1
they believe their design fits well with the current trend of new build houses getting smaller as ‘ saving space is a big concern			0
