but when panic set in , the tiny youngster - who was just hours old - became confused and wandered off with the herders and cows			2
he had got separated from his family after following a herd of cattle in the mountains touch down : @entity40 was helicoptered to safety of the @entity43 elephant nursery too young to know any different and with a fresh umbilical cord and pink ears , the tiny animal trotted off with the cattle			1
the @entity10 community cared for the elephant , who had barely mastered how to walk , before one of them set off on a 24 - hour journey by foot down the mountainside to find help			1
the area was so remote , that a helicopter had to be chartered so it could be transported to the safe haven of the @entity43 ’s elephant nursery , which specialises in caring for orphaned baby elephants			0
