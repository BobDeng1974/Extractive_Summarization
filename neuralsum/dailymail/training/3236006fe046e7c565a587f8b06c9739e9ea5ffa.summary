@entity0 will continue to develop a nastier and more cynical side to their football as they prepare for clashes with @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity6 first noted the problem of @entity0 being too soft after the @entity8 in @entity9 , when he admitted ‘ maybe we ’re too honest ’ compared with more streetwise opponents like @entity11 and @entity12			2
@entity13 and his coaching team have sought to address this during the opening games of the @entity18 campaign and vice-captain @entity19 believes it is starting to make an impact			1
@entity0 vice-captain @entity19 says the @entity0 will continue to develop a nastier side to their game @entity19 says @entity23 at @entity24 has a tendency to play nastier and develop a more cynical approach ‘ we ’ve been too nice in the past , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ we ’ve got a very young team and it comes with experience , knowing when to slow things down , not to always play out from the back			2
‘ everybody has this philosophy of playing from the back from the keeper , but there are times to think , “ hold on , let ’s not play out from the back this time , let ’s kick it up the front for five or 10 minutes ”			1
‘ there are times to kill it off , or slow things down when things are n’t going well			0
it ’s just managing the game really , which maybe we are doing a lot better			0
it ’s something that has been addressed			0
’ @entity19 receives similar messages from his club manager @entity23 at @entity24			0
‘ @entity23 has been a master of that , ’ said the centre back			0
‘ it ’s a part of play at @entity24 and that ’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad			0
‘ people know when to do that and not			0
that ’s something that ’s coming into the make - up with @entity0 and that ’s why we are progressing			0
’ @entity19 : ' it ’s a part of play at @entity24 and that ’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad ' @entity19 has become vice-captain of @entity0 under manager @entity13 ahead of the match against @entity4 @entity19 was outstanding in the 1 - 0 away win in @entity74 on his last @entity0 appearance , shouldering responsibility and stepping out of the back four to get physical with opponents after a series of midfield fouls on @entity80 and @entity81			1
‘ we are definitely a lot harder to play against , ’ he added			1
‘ that ’s about being physical , wanting to win the ball back , being aggressive and getting tight to the player			1
‘ it ’s more physical than verbal — i do n’t think that helps much — but when players are trying to hold the ball up , you ’re behind them and they ’re thinking , “ what ’s this guy doing ? ” that ’s when they know they ’re in a game			2
’ coach and former @entity0 right back @entity99 has been keen to get these points across to those stepping up to the international scene			0
@entity19 added : ‘ he was a fantastic player in a great back four and he likes the kind of hard , tough - to - play - against , physical , almost old - school style , whereby you let the attackers or centre forward know they are in a game and feel your presence			1
’ @entity19 , @entity112 and @entity113 are part of @entity0 's defensive set up and chat during training			2

@entity19 *promises* @entity0 are continuing to develop their nastier side
