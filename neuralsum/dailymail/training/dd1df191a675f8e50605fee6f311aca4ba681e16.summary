by @entity0 for @entity1 just a month after she filed for divorce from actor @entity4 , @entity2 has opened up about another tragic loss ; half of her hearing			1
ms @entity7 , a 28 - year - old writer and mother - of - one based in @entity9 , was working as an office assistant four years ago , when out of nowhere , an agonizing piercing sound struck her ears ; forcing her straight to the @entity13 , where doctors diagnosed her with ' sudden hearing loss ' in one ear			1
' i ca n’t hear you			2
i ca n’t hear anything ! ' ms @entity20 writes for salon , recalling her heartbreaking words to her doctor during the hospital hearing test			1
' at 24 , i had gone from a feisty , uninhibited , outspoken yogini to a statistic			2
' nightmare moment : writer and mother - of - one @entity28 ( pictured ) has opened up about suddenly and inexplicably losing her hearing in one ear , a day in 2010 which would change her life forever in addition to losing her hearing in one ear , ms @entity7 struggled with accompanying nausea and vertigo , and it was months before she managed to regain her balance			1
' @entity9 , the vibrant place i ’d once fallen madly for , became a nightmare , ' she writes			2
' the streets were humming , whirring			2
tractors moaned , ambulances screamed , the click of lighters and the hiss of brooms brushing cafe floors were torture			0
' only a year later , ms @entity7 would meet 42 - year - old @entity49 star @entity4 quite by chance at a @entity9 dog park ; marry him soon after and have their son @entity52 , now two			1
a found love : a year after she lost half her hearing , ms @entity7 ( right ) met 42 - year - old @entity4 ( center ) at a @entity9 dog park , married him soon after and had son @entity52 , now two ( left ) but dating immediately after she lost her hearing was nothing short of ' bleak , ' according to her account			1
' men would repeat their clever lines only once or twice before mumbling " never mind " and moving onto the next woman , ' she writes			0
' @entity64 was not sexy , deaf was mortifying			2
' for months , ms @entity7 refused to leave the house much and when she did , she was anxious and withdrawn			1
because her condition was ' invisible ' and she had retained hearing in one ear , she just about got away with hiding her disability - a term she admits she has only recently become comfortable using - from friends			1
but only for so long			0
' @entity64 was not sexy , deaf was mortifying ' eventually , as the hearing in her other ear began to fade , she was forced to make her peace with it			1
and while she confesses she will always be known as ' someone ’s half - deaf friend @entity78 ' , she says it no longer defines her			2
now she arrives to dinner parties early to nab a seat at the end of the table so as to expose her good hear to as many guests as possible , and has sourced special headphones which enable her to enjoy music properly			0
happier times : while ms @entity7 ( left , in 2013 ) - who split with mr @entity4 ( right ) in january - confesses she will always be known as ' someone 's half - deaf friend @entity78 ' , she says it no longer defines her sadly , ms @entity7 has also had to accept the fact that her good ear will also eventually fail her			1
' because one ear is strained from doing the work of two , i will completely lose my ability to hear , ' she writes			2
' it will happen sooner rather than later and knowing that is terrifying			0
' it 's not the only brush she has had with ill health			0
the year after ms @entity7 lost her hearing , and right before she met mr @entity4 , she was diagnosed with cervical cancer			1
in an interview with the @entity107 , she reveals that her then - new boyfriend , now ex-husband , was the first person she shared the news with			0
' i will completely lose my ability to hear			0
it will happen sooner rather than later and knowing that is terrifying ' ' i just blurted out			0
" i 'm sick , " and he was the first person i told			0
it was terrifying to say it out loud because it gave it power and made it real , and it meant that i had cancer , ' she said			0
just six weeks into their relationship , and while ms @entity7 was undergoing grueling treatment , mr @entity4 proposed to her			1
what break up ? mr @entity4 and ms @entity7 were seen in @entity9 looking rather affectionate with each other in april ( pictured ) after their split in january , and before they filed their divorce papers in june just as doctors informed her that she would likely have to undergo a hysterectomy , she discovered she was pregnant , and against the advice of ' every oncologist ' she spoke to , ms @entity7 went ahead with the ' difficult but successful ' pregnancy			1
' when we were picking baby names , we specifically picked the name @entity52 , because it meant “ calm and restful , ” ' she wrote			0
' we were like , " wow , that ’s what we need			0
' we need something in our life that ’s just going to be so calm and peaceful because we have n’t had that since we ’ve been together			0
" ' in january of this year , the couple split and last month ms @entity7 filed for divorce			1
she has neglected to say why ; but both parties insist that their parting was mutually amicable			0
in a recent interview with people , mr @entity4 said : ' we have been through a divorce and divorce is n't something i would wish on my worst enemy			1
' even when in our case we have managed to do it not only amicably but as - hopefully in the end great friends - particularly because we have a young child that we both truly love			0

ms @entity7 lost her hearing in one ear in 2010 and will soon be deaf in the other
the cause of her deafness remains a *mystery*
she filed for divorce from actor @entity4 last month after two years of marriage
