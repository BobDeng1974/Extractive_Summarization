the 87 - year - old tyrant told a group of young people : ‘ do not get tempted into homosexuality			0
we will punish you severely			0
‘ it becomes worse and satanic when you get a prime minister like @entity4 saying countries that want @entity5 aid should accept homosexuality			2
@entity2 , who has previously compared homosexuals to animals , branded @entity4 as ' satanic ' ‘ to come with that diabolical suggestion to our people is a stupid offer			1
’ @entity2 referred to previous remarks in which he compared homosexuals to animals			1
he added : ‘ it [ homosexuality ] is condemned by nature			0
it is condemned by insects and that is why i have said [ homosexuals ] are worse than pigs and dogs			0
’ gay sex is illegal in @entity3 , and two same - sex individuals caught even holding hands face prison			2
many other @entity43 countries take a similar line			0
last month mr @entity4 said he believed @entity5 funding to developing nations should in future depend on recipients ’ record on human rights			1
