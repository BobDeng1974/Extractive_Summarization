the man with the dog tattoo tends to do things a little differently , which is probably why @entity3 wo n’t roll over when @entity4 come to town this month			1
‘ it ’s for @entity8 , ’ says @entity6			1
one of the most upwardly mobile @entity10 managers is referring to the letter @entity12 inked on his right wrist			2
‘ it ’s the only tattoo i have			2
he was the @entity17 i had here when i moved away from home to be an apprentice			2
some people do n’t understand it			2
’ @entity3 manager @entity6 is enjoying a very successful second spell as @entity24 boss @entity6 congratulates the @entity3 squad after knocking @entity26 out of the @entity27 in october he laughs , but there are many things about this 37 - year - old , who has taken charge of more than 300 games , that are not entirely conventional			1
there are the text - message rituals he shares with the club ’s @entity38 owner and the £ 3,000 he once took from his own pocket to get his players into shape			1
there ’s also his answer to the question of whether he would leave if a @entity47 club approached him before the end of the season			2
the 37 - year - old , bellowing out instructions on the touchline , is passionate about the job at @entity3 ‘ i genuinely would n’t , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m in a good place , with freedom and control and support from the owner			2
i have learnt that when you are in management there should be no rush — it ’s easy to go wrong			2
‘ so long as we are progressing and i can work in these conditions , i have no desire to go anywhere			2
’ the truth is that @entity3 and @entity6 are a good mixture			1
@entity3 's @entity70 celebrates scoring against @entity26 in the @entity27 it ’s the club that nurtured him and whom he served for more than 300 games across two spells as a player , the second of which came after fans pledged £ 13,500 online to help buy him			1
as a manager , either side of a stint at @entity84 , he took the financially - crippled club from the foot of @entity88 in 2008 to fourth in the @entity89 today			1
they have done it playing passing , attacking football			2
more still , they host @entity4 on december 17 in the quarter - final of the @entity27 , pitting @entity6 against @entity95 , the man he credits for so much of his education			1
@entity6 played for @entity3 during two spells , appearing over 300 times for the south coast side ‘ if my memory is right , we first met when @entity101 played @entity84 way back in the @entity89 in 2011 , ’ @entity6 says			1
‘ we were fortunate because we beat @entity101 but i was really impressed by him — not just his passion but the way his team played			2
‘ i rang him at some point after that and said , “ do you mind if i come in and watch you work ? ” ‘ it might sound strange , coming from one @entity89 manager to another			1
i ’ve only asked a few times about things like that and @entity95 was the only one who opened the door			2
‘ they got promoted to the @entity47 and that ’s when i went in			0
’ he met @entity95 at the public health club where @entity101 used to train			2
@entity6 adds : ‘ he had this tiny office			1
i took a lot from that meeting — the facilities were n’t what i was expecting			0
it proved the quality of the coaching is the most important thing			0
@entity6 spent a day learning with @entity95 during the @entity4 manager 's time as @entity101 boss ‘ he spent the whole day with me , sharing his views on life and football			1
what he said really stuck with me			0
he could n’t emphasise enough how important it is to educate yourself as much as you can and his sessions were brilliant			0
‘ i learnt as much from that one day as i did from a huge time in management			0
‘ i will always be grateful to him and respect him for that			0
and if he wants to loan me @entity146 or @entity147 , that would be nice , too			0
’ these are good times for @entity6 , who admits : ‘ the thought of a cup quarter - final and contending to get in the @entity47 is strange — i ’ve been here a very long time and i know where we came from			1
’ @entity6 was a fans ’ favourite as a defender for the club , having joined at 10 and risen through the age groups			1
‘ i did pre-season under @entity160 and that was brutal , ’ he says			0
@entity6 ’s peak came when he won two @entity164 under 21 caps at the @entity165 in 1998			1
‘ i was the unknown guy from @entity3 , ’ he says			1
‘ there was @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 — they were all @entity47			0
when i joined @entity171 in 2002 , i worked under @entity172			0
he really knows how to build a team			0
’ @entity6 was @entity172 ’s first signing at @entity171 , given his big chance in the @entity89 , but he badly injured his knee on his debut and from there it was tough			1
@entity3 fans celebrate after securing their promotion to the championship back in may 2013 he returned to @entity3 in 2004 but the knee ultimately meant his retirement in 2007 , aged 29			1
after some time coaching at the club , his phone rang on @entity188 , 2008			2
they had started the season with a 17 - point deduction and @entity192 was sacked with the club deep in the relegation zone and broke			1
‘ i was at a party , ’ @entity6 says			1
‘ i remember getting a phone call and going to the garden trying to get a signal			0
i was offered the job and the world sort of stopped spinning for me			0
i said yes instantly but i was asking myself , “ what are you doing ? ” ‘ i do n’t think i would have ever had the opportunity elsewhere			0
my only chance was here , where i had this connection			0
but in your head you know if you are not successful in that first job you are on the scrapheap at 31			0
i was really worried about letting people down			0
’ the @entity213 ’s youngest manager kept them in @entity88 , got promotion the next season and , after a 19 - month stint at @entity89 club @entity84 , returned following the unexpected death of his mother in october 2012			1
he landed his second promotion that season			0
‘ there was simply no money when i first joined in 2009 , ’ @entity6 says			1
‘ we were literally 15 minutes from going out of business			0
bailiffs were turning up , players were n’t getting paid			0
the @entity24 boss is a hero at @entity228 , with a @entity3 fan using a @entity6 mask to celebrate ‘ i remember before we went up from @entity88 , i wanted a sport scientist for pre-season			1
‘ @entity233 ( @entity234 , his assistant ) and i paid £ 3,000 for that from our own pockets			0
i did n’t tell my family			0
’ these days , under @entity38 millionaire @entity242 , motivational quotes from @entity240 to @entity241 line the stadium walls and finances are considerably healthier , even though @entity6 gets ‘ quite annoyed ’ when people say they have bought success in his second stint			1
he adds : ‘ you need money to reach this level and the owner has been great			0
but our wage bill is probably mid-championship and our back four is the same as when we were bottom three in @entity255			0
’ @entity6 , celebrating during his playing days for @entity3 , is also enjoying success as their manager today , they are top four in the @entity89 with the superstitious leaders of the club growing more twitchy			1
@entity242 apparently opted against attending the win over @entity26 in the @entity27 fourth round because he did not wish to ‘ jinx ’ the side , and @entity6 does not know if he will attend the game against @entity4			1
‘ we have a few quite superstitious people here , myself included , ’ @entity6 says			1
‘ i get to the ground at 10am before every home game and i have my way of setting certain things up			0
‘ @entity271 and i also text each other about an hour and a half before a game			0
a few of the board have superstitions as well			0
it ’s one of those things about professional sport — you learn to value luck			0
’ you would imagine @entity3 have learned the value of a @entity188 phone call , too .			2
