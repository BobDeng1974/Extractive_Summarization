by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 9 july 2013 it has taken ten years and some rather painstaking work , but horticulturalists have managed to grow orange raspberries			0
the new breed , called @entity6 , is the same shape and size as the red raspberry and tastes the same , although some growers have said they are slightly more tangy			1
and while normal raspberry plants bear fruit only once every two years , the @entity6 variety has fruit every year			1
botanists are celebrating after breeding a new species of raspberry that is set to transform the fruit salad thanks to its striking orange colour horticulturalists at the @entity22 in @entity23 crossed a red raspberry plant with the yellow variety using natural cross-pollination techniques until they achieved the perfect orange shade			1
the plants are now available to buy and can be grown in the ground or a large container on a patio			2
potted plants are available in packs of two for £ 12.99 from @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , or from suttons.co.uk			0
the plants are now being sold in the @entity39 for the first time and can be grown in the ground or in a large container			2
@entity42 , 65 , a senior horticulturalist at @entity34 , said : ‘ the breeder used cross pollination techniques to make the orange coloured raspberries			1
‘ they used an autumn fruiting red raspberry plant with the yellow variety to make the orange shade			2
the fruit is exactly the same size and shape as its red cousin and even tastes the same , but is an unusually eye - catching shade the new fruit has been dubbed ' @entity6 ' because of its warm hue ‘ normally raspberry plants only grow fruit on them once every two years but the @entity6 will have fruit every year			1
‘ the plants grow to a maximum height of 6.5ft tall and they can be harvested every autumn after planting in the spring			0
‘ this is the first time people can grow the orange variety in their garden and they can be grown in the ground or in a large container on the patio			0
‘ they taste very similar to the normal ones you would find in the supermarket but i would say they have more of a tang to them			0
‘ we suggest putting them in a fruit salad with red raspberries for a good contrast			0
’ horticulturalists at a plant research centre in @entity23 have spent the last 10 years breeding the @entity6 raspberry by using natural cross pollination techniques the @entity22 crossed a red raspberry plant with the yellow variety to make orange shades until they bred the perfect colour without the red pigmentation			1

@entity6 has been created in @entity23 using cross pollination techniques
it is the same size and shape as its red cousin and tastes almost the same
it was created by crossing red raspberry plants with yellow ones
the new plants are now on sale in the @entity39
