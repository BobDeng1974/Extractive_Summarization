@entity2 's stars are being worked harder in training than ever before by new manager @entity4 , club insiders have revealed			1
such is @entity6 's ferocious desire to fast track the players he inherited from @entity8 on to the levels he desires that @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 are being driven relentlessly by the @entity15 coach on a daily basis			1
chief among @entity6 's methods as he tries to bring about fundamental change at @entity20 are incessant passing drills that see the @entity2 players put through endless repetitive routines aimed at honing and developing new instincts			1
@entity2 's players have been put through their paces daily since @entity4 took over as boss @entity4 has placed extra importance on passing drillsas he stamps his authority on @entity2 @entity4 has stepped up the intensity of @entity2 's training to get stars such as @entity34 fitter @entity6 has spoken of how he wishes his players to think differently and react differently when they are in possession			1
by putting them through these endless drills , he hopes they will use the ball better and will eventually make better decisions without even seeming to think			2
the new @entity2 manager has also shown himself to be a lover of double training sessions			1
@entity6 asked the @entity2 squad to train twice - a - day regularly on pre-season tour of @entity47 as he sought to change his players ' thoughts and instincts quickly			2
that practise has continued to an extent , though , now that the @entity54 season has started and it 's not unusual for players to train late in the morning , rest in the sleep unit that was installed last year at @entity59 and then train again in the afternoon			2
' it can seem relentless but the players understand why @entity62 is doing it , ' said a club source on tuesday			0
@entity4 was spotted leaving the @entity65 in @entity66 on tuesday morning @entity4 seemed to be looking for the right space as he prepared to leave the @entity69 hotel @entity4 was seen loading his gear into a car as he left the @entity65 @entity2 's players have also been playing full - paced 11v11 games in training prior to games @entity12 ( right , with @entity76 ) has praised the methods of @entity4 @entity2 's players have often been sleeping at @entity59 between double training sessions ' the passing drills are incredible			1
it 's just ' pass , pass , pass ' until the manager and his coaches think the players are beginning to do it almost naturally and instinctively			0
' @entity87 – who played under @entity4 for two years for the @entity15 national team – said yesterday that some of the @entity2 manager 's sessions are ' incredible ' , with players having to be focussed during ' every single minute '			1
it is also understood that another of @entity6 's policies is to play full - sided 11 v 11 games for 45 minutes two days before a game			2
this game is required to be of the intensity of a @entity54 game and is aimed at preparing the players mentally and physically for the competitive game that is due to follow 48 hours later			0
@entity11 ( left , with coach @entity103 ) and his @entity2 team - mates are said to be pleased with training @entity106 ( left ) and @entity76 are two new signings adapting to @entity4 's training methods it is not unusual for managers to play full - sided games in training as it allows the weekend 's anticipated first team the opportunity to get used to each other and grow familiarity			2
however , they are usually played at half or three - quarter pace and full - on contact is minimal as managers are generally paranoid about injuries			0
what has struck the @entity2 players about @entity6 's 45 minute games , though , has been the intensity			1
to play these games at full pace is rare but @entity6 insists on it so that his players are ' match ready ' when the actual competitive fixture comes around two days later			0
during his time in @entity131 – and indeed during the @entity132 – @entity6 has shown himself to be surprisingly open about injuries and fitness issues			0
most managers like to hide problems from the public so as to keep the opposition guessing and will sometimes exaggerate minor knocks to fool rivals in to thinking star players are n't available			0
@entity6 does n't do this but the former @entity144 and @entity145 coach is obsessively secretive about his team shapes and training drills to the extent that he will only allow players and staff absolutely vital to the session anywhere near the @entity59 pitches when the first team are working			1
@entity153 made his debut for @entity2 against @entity155 last saturday @entity153 ( left ) is one of several young players @entity4 has promoted to @entity2 's first team other @entity59 staff are asked to stay away so that @entity6 can go about his business in private before players are handed individual dvds and dossiers of their training performances to watch later with @entity2 's performance staff and even at home in their spare time			1
meanwhile , @entity2 fans can expect @entity6 to introduce more young players in to the team			1
sources have revealed that players like @entity153 – who made his debut at home to @entity155 on saturday – will continue to be blooded even when it 's not 100 per cent necessary as @entity175 is determined to find out which are good enough and which are n't as soon as possible			2
' he 's doing great , ' added @entity87 this week			0
' he 's trying to get his philosophy in to a lot of new players			0
i 'm convinced that we will do what he wants us to do and go where he wants us to go			0
it 's very demanding but in a good way			0

new @entity2 boss has *implemented* a strict new training regime
only players and essential staff allowed on @entity59 pitches when the first team are training due to @entity6 's desire for complete secrecy
@entity6 's hopes repetitive drills will improve players when on the ball
players sometimes sleep at @entity59 between double training sessions
sources say players have responded well to @entity6 's methods
@entity15 also *pledges* to continue *fielding* young players in first team
