@entity0 admits that his unwanted habit of turning in awful second - round scores has ' got into my head ' ahead of @entity5			1
the @entity6 is searching for his third major title this week but arrives at @entity8 on the back of a disappointing @entity10 , in which he began with a then course record 64 before seeing his victory hopes disappear after collapsing to a shocking 78 the next day			1
it is the latest in a string of poor second - round scores which have scuppered his chances at high - profile tournaments and @entity0 admitted at a press conference on tuesday morning that his friday scoring is becoming a problem			1
' i 'd like to stop it this week , ' said the 25 - year - old @entity6			1
' it 's got into my head and i 've been going out on friday trying to back up my score			0
' i 've got to go out and pretend it 's a thursday again , ‘ he said , before adding : ‘ i do n't know			0
i 've got to go out and play , play a few solid holes and get the round underway			1
hopefully this week i can turn around that second round thing			1
' the former @entity36 and @entity38 @entity37 champion added : ' i have been caught out by a bad stretch of holes at every tournament this year			0
i just need to eliminate that			0
it 's easier to eliminate the bad stuff than find the good stuff			0
' preparation : @entity0 practices his putting at @entity8 ahead of @entity5 this week those second round woes have cost @entity0 either victory or a chance of contending for the top prize at the masters , @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54			1
but despite that bizarre friday feeling , @entity0 insists he is in top form ahead of @entity5 and in the best position he has ever been to battle for the @entity59			1
for a player who once shot a scarcely believable 61 at @entity61 - one of the toughest links of them all - @entity0 ’s record in @entity5 is poor for a player of such immense talent			1
a third at @entity68 in 2010 is his only top - 10 in @entity5 , while he raged against the capricious nature of links golf after struggling at @entity71 ’s a year later and missed the cut at @entity73 12 months ago			2
off colour : @entity0 endured a disappointing @entity10 in @entity75 @entity76 shaped : after shooting a first round of 64 , @entity0 followed up by carding 78 in round two but @entity0 appeared to be in a positive frame of mind on tuesday ahead of his latest attempt to master golf by the @entity84 seaside at @entity8			1
' i feel as prepared as i ever have coming in to the @entity5 , ’ he said			0
‘ i had a good week in @entity75 in preparation for @entity5			2
i was a little disappointed with my finish			0
i had one not so good round			2
but my game is in good shape			0
' my record in the @entity5 is n't as good as i 'd like			0
i want to do something about that this week			2
’ ' @entity5 is special - it 's the only major played outside the @entity38 , it 's on links , it has the oldest and richest history of all of them			1
it would be great to put my name on the @entity59 one day			0
it would be the third leg of a career grand slam			2
not many players have done that			0
i would love to get my name on the trophy			0
' @entity106 - day 2 highlights			2
