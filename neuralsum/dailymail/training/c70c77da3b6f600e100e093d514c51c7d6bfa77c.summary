by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:00 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:20 est , 16 december 2013 @entity4 ’s aristocratic relatives have been urged to end a bitter family legal feud that is ‘ haemorrhaging money ’			1
@entity7 , the prime minister ’s wife ’s second cousin , had sued his 74 - year - old father in the @entity11 over land given to him by his grandfather			2
judge @entity14 found in favour of @entity16 mr @entity7 but urged the warring family ‘ whether it might be possible , even at this very late stage , to resolve what remains of this dispute by mediation or negotiation , rather than by further litigation ’			1
he added : ‘ the costs are completely out of control ... this case is haemorrhaging money			0
’ wrangle : @entity7 , 50 , left , won a case against his family trustees , including his father @entity31 , 74 , right , which entitles him to 25 years of income from a proportion of an estate in @entity36 mr @entity7 , 50 , was given a 25 per cent stake in his family ’s 1,000 acre @entity36 estate in 1983 by his grandfather , @entity40			1
but he says he was deprived of his share of income until his grandfather died in 2008 aged 95			0
he sued his father @entity31 in an attempt to recover money from rent , farm yields and shooting fees covering 25 years			2
last month the @entity11 heard that the grandfather – youngest son of sir @entity49 , the sixth baronet of @entity52 – had rescued the family fortunes after the @entity54 were threatened by crippling death duties following the @entity56			0
he established the estate at @entity58 , near @entity59 , in 1968			0
it was his fervent wish that his son @entity31 and subsequent heirs would maintain the estate			0
after being advised he could save on @entity64 by making lifetime gifts to his heirs , he signed documents in 1983 that handed a quarter of the income from the land to his grandson , then 19			2
legacy : @entity7 , left , died in 2008 aged 95 after spending his life worrying about ' ruinous taxation			0
he is the great uncle of @entity4 , right the younger @entity7 was then in his second year at university and did not read the documents properly before he signed them			1
he was led to believe that he would not see any real financial benefit until his grandfather passed away , said judge @entity78			0
it was only in 2004 that he found out about his income rights			0
by this time @entity7 was bitterly estranged from his father and other members of the family			2
the earlier hearing was told that he believed his parents were responsible for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his nannies			0
the amount being claimed by mr @entity7 , who like mrs @entity4 is a great - grandchild of sir @entity49 , has not been disclosed			1
judge @entity78 has now found in his favour , saying that there ‘ could be no real doubt ’ the true effect of the gift had been deliberately concealed from him and that he had been entitled to 25 per cent of the estate ’s net income since the day the documents were signed			1
the former chairman of bank note paper manufacturers portals established a 1,000 - acre farming estate in @entity36 ( pictured ) his grandfather , by retaining all the income , had acted in breach of trust			1

‘ the reality is that the information that was withheld from him was information that his grandfather ought to have disclosed			0
’ @entity113 and the other estate trustees had argued that there had been ‘ an informal arrangement ’ that @entity7 would get no income from the estate until after the grandfather ’s death			1
but judge @entity78 said in his ruling that , if that were so , the 1983 gift to @entity7 was ‘ a sham in its classical sense ’ and would have achieved nothing apart from the tax saving that the grandfather was so desperately hoping for .			1

@entity7 , 50 , took his family to court over missed earnings
he had been given 25 per cent of a @entity36 estate in 1983 but received no money from it
he was given the property by @entity40 , @entity4 *'s* great - uncle , but did not known he was entitled to an income
high court judge found in his favour , but urged the family to settle the matter outside the courts
