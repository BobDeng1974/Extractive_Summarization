a handwritten notebook in which @entity3 's enigma machine genius @entity1 admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $ 1million ( Â£ 690,000 )			2
the 56 - page book bought in @entity6 contains @entity1 's thoughts on the clearly tricky ' @entity9 notation dx / dy '			1
' i find [ it ] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one i understood the best once ! ' he wrote			0
above , he wrote that the @entity9 notation was ' extremely difficult ' it was written at the @entity20 code - breaking headquarters in 1942 and paved the way for computer science			1
it is believed to be the only extensive @entity1 manuscript known to exist , the auctioneer said			1
@entity26 , who played @entity1 in the @entity28 - nominated @entity27 , said : ' @entity1 was a war hero , who broke the enigma code helping to bring an end to @entity31 , the father of modern computing science , and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result			2
' his impact on our everyday lives is enormous , and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling			2
' the notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician @entity49			0

' in a statement through @entity85 , @entity1 scholar @entity83 said the notebook sheds more light on how @entity1 ' remained committed to free - thinking work in pure mathematics			1
' @entity26 , who played @entity1 in the @entity28 - nominated @entity27 ( left ) , said : ' the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling ' in some @entity1 elaborates on his conclusions , writing that one result ' is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition ' he added : ' @entity1 was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value			2
