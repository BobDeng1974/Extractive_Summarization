by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:04 am on 30th june 2011 @entity2 yesterday launched its own social network in an attempt to challenge @entity5 with a service that ties together all its existing sites including @entity8			0
@entity9 is structured in a remarkably similar way to @entity5 , with profile pictures and news feeds forming a central core			1
however , a user 's friends or contacts are grouped into specific circles of their choosing - as opposed to the common pool of friends typical on @entity5			1
@entity9 aims to address that balance circles of friends : the site is seeking to differentiate itself by letting users divide their friends into ' circles ' @entity9 started rolling out to a limited number of users on tuesday in what the company is calling a field trial			1
only those invited to join will initially be able to use the service			0
@entity2 did not say when it would be more widely available			0
the service does not currently feature advertising			0
to create @entity9 , the company went back to the drawing board in the wake of several notable failures , including @entity48 and @entity49 , a micro-blogging service whose launch was marred by privacy snafus			1
' we learned a lot in @entity49 , and one of the things we learned is that there 's a real market opportunity for a product that addresses people 's concerns around privacy and how their information is shared , ' said @entity2 spokesman @entity65			2
@entity2 drew more than one billion visitors worldwide to its websites in may , more than any other company , according to web analytics firm @entity70			1
but people are spending more time on @entity5 - the average @entity72 visitor spent 375minutes on @entity5 in may , compared with 231minutes for @entity2			2
news feed : the service updates users of developments within its circle of friends learning its lessons : executives say they have taken onboard failures such as @entity48 and @entity49 @entity9 seems designed to make its online properties a pervasive part of the daily online experience , rather than being spots where web surfers occasionally check in to search for a website or check email			1
as with @entity5 's service , @entity9 has a central web page that displays an ever - updating stream of the comments , photos and links being shared by friends and contacts			1
a toolbar across the top of most of @entity2 's sites - such as its main search page , its @entity8 site and its @entity108 site - allows users to access their personalised data feed			1
they can then contribute their own information to the stream			2
@entity9 will also offer a special video chat feature , in which up to ten people can jump on a conference call			1
and @entity2 will automatically store photos taken on mobile phones on its internet servers , allowing a @entity9 user to access the photos from any computer and share them			1
expansion : chief executive @entity123 is keen to build @entity2 's social networking presence @entity2 chief executive @entity123 has made social networking a top priority at the world 's number one internet search engine , whose position as the main gateway to online information could be at risk as people spend more time on sites such as @entity5 and @entity136			2
enticing consumers to join another social networking service will not be easy , said @entity139 , an analyst with @entity140			0
' they 're going to have an uphill battle due to @entity5 's network effects , ' said @entity139 , citing the 700million users that some research firms say are currently on @entity5 's service			2
' the more users they ( @entity5 ) get , the harder it gets for @entity2 to steal those , ' he said			0
but he added that @entity2 's popularity in web search and email could help it gain a following			0
to set its service apart from @entity5 , @entity2 is betting on what it says is a better approach to privacy -- a hot - button issue that has burned @entity5 , as well as @entity2 , in the past			0
@entity161 to @entity9 are the ' circles ' of friends and acquaintances			1
users can organise contacts into different customized circles - family members , co-workers , college friends - and share photos , videos or other information only within those groups			1
' in the online world there 's this ' share box ' and you type into it and you have no idea who is going to get that , or where it 's going to land , or how it 's going to embarrass you six months from now , ' said mr @entity65			0
' for us , privacy is n't buried six panels deep , ' he added			0
@entity5 , which has been criticised for its confusing privacy controls , introduced a feature last year that lets users create smaller groups of friends			2
@entity2 , without mentioning @entity5 by name , said other social networking services ' attempts to create groups have been ' bolt - on ' efforts that do not work as well			0
@entity5 did not comment on @entity2 's new social networking service .			0

@entity9 started rolling out to a limited number of users on tuesday in what the company is calling a field trial
users can separate friends into separate ' circles '
