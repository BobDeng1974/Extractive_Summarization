' this cover makes him look like some kind of cool rock god ... it 's horrible ' said another commentary on the magazine ’s @entity56 feed			1
why give the guy the cover of @entity3 ? @entity100 gave @entity101 the cover and all the magazines carried pictures of the @entity106 shooters on the covers , too			1
do n't make martyrs out of these people			2
' @entity7 , who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in @entity112 , has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing @entity7 has already attracted a gaggle of female supporters organized as the ‘ @entity124 ’ movement who have posted comments on social media sites expressing their love for him			1
this is n’t the first time the magazine has featured a notorious figure on its cover , murderer @entity125 was featured back in june 1970			1

as he lay in the boat , surrounded by @entity158 teams and police , @entity155 negotiators mentioned a public plea for his surrender from his former wrestling coach			0
an agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff , that convinced @entity7 to ultimately give up			0
tragedy : the april 15 bombings at the @entity174 killed three people and wounded more than 260 around 2008 , his older brother @entity42 confided to his mother that he felt like ' two people ' were inside him			2
she confided this to a close friend who felt he might need a psychiatrist , but @entity183 believed that religion would be the cure for her son ’s inner demons and growing mental instability , and pushed him deeper into @entity18			0
@entity7 's high school , @entity189 , is famously diverse , but he played down the fact that he was a @entity191			2
as his brother and mother became more religious , he did , however , attend a small friday prayer group that met at lunchtime , and once got quite upset when a friend who 'd converted to @entity18 talked about it in a casual way			0
‘ @entity18 was n't casual to @entity7 ’ says one friend			0
‘ he took his religion seriously			0
