she 's the favourite to win the best actress @entity1 for her role in @entity4 tonight but @entity5 is by no means just an actress			1
in fact , the 54 - year - old has written a series of children 's books and is such an experienced interior designer that she 's picked out the pieces decorating the green room at the @entity1 ceremony itself			1
however , in an interview with @entity17 , she admitted her true life goal : ' i really wanted a family , i really wanted children and i did n't want to compromise on that			2
' @entity5 ( pictured on saturday ) counts interior design and children 's fiction writing as just some of her outside passions , but the real thing that drives her is being a mother to her two children although she 's struggled to balance work and family - calling it ' hell ' at times - the actress , who plays a woman with early onset @entity35 in the highly praised film , said she has ' loved every minute ' of motherhood			1
@entity5 has two children with director husband @entity40 , @entity41 , 12 , and @entity42 , 17			1
the dream of a family was instilled in her from a young age by her mother , who died in 2009			0
' she always told me that you can have both [ career and family ]			0
i think that it was important to realise what i valued , what i wanted , and to find a way to make them both happen , ' she said			0
another thing @entity5 inherited from her mother is an acute eye for interior design , which has been further enriched by her brother - in - law , architect @entity59			2
in fact , the @entity1 nominee was even enlisted to select the furniture and decor for the green room backstage at the @entity1 this year , a task that has previously been assigned to designers including @entity67 , who teamed up with @entity68 , and @entity69			1
' [ my mother ] always told me that you can have both [ career and family ] , ' said @entity5 ( seen in january with son @entity42 , daughter @entity41 and husband @entity40 ) @entity5 , who collaborated with @entity74 - based design studio @entity73 on the design project , chose a @entity77 theme , with the aim of making the room feel as if @entity80 ' invited you over for a drink before the @entity1 , ' according to @entity83 , a partner at @entity73			1
she said her mother , who was @entity84 , cared about where her family lived and made their houses look beautiful			0
' and that 's something that i got from her and now i can see it in my daughter			0
i 'm always fascinated by the urge to decorate			0
it does n't seem to be a necessity and yet we 've done it for centuries			0
' when she 's not exercising her eye for design or spending quality time with her kids , @entity5 also writes children 's stories , including 2007 bestseller @entity104 , about a young redhead girl finding confidence in a world full of blondes and brunettes			1
@entity5 is nominated for a best actress @entity1 for her role in @entity4 , the story of a professor diagnosed with early - onset alzheimer 's at age 50 , which hits @entity117 theatres on march 6 she has another book , @entity119 , launching in july as part of a five - book contract with @entity122			1
with all these non-hollywood skills and interests , it 's easy to forget the reason why @entity5 is a household name in the first place - her three - decade - long acting career , for which she has earned five @entity1 nominations , two @entity132 and four @entity134 nods , among many more accolades			2
but it 's certainly not something she takes for granted			0
she recalled a conversation with her father who remarked that she 'd been acting for 30 years			0
@entity5 said : ' i thought , oh my @entity142 , i feel lucky that it 's gone on for that long and that i 've had the experiences that i 've had			2

@entity5 , 54 , is nominated for best actress at the @entity1 tonight
was chosen to design the green room backstage at the awards ceremony
a children 's book writer , she has two kids , @entity41 , 12 , and @entity42 , 17
