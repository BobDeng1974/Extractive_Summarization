by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 19:35 est , 3 september 2012 anger : @entity2 is furious over husband @entity4 's treatment an elderly dementia sufferer has been forced to move seven times in just over a year , leaving his wife fuming			1
@entity2 says she often finds husband @entity4 , 73 , in tears when she visits him at his care home in @entity10			1
the 72 - year - old is furious that @entity4 has been moved from a purpose built unit because of a reorganisation within the local @entity15			1
@entity4 was diagnosed with @entity17 ’s disease in 2006 and his wife of 41 years cared for him in their home until last june			1
he has since been moved seven times something which has upset both him and @entity2 as she says his condition means he needs to be settled			1
@entity4 was first taken into a mental health in - patient facility called @entity24 in @entity10 but was able to return home after several weeks			1
he was forced to return following a water infection and was then transferred to an assessment bed in a care home , then back into hospital , then a different care home			2
most recently he was sectioned under the @entity31 for the third time and moved to @entity33			1
@entity2 said the facility , which was purpose built for dementia patients , was ideal to meet his needs but unfortunately @entity4 was moved back to @entity37 in early august			2
it followed a decision made by @entity10 and @entity40 , which provides mental health care in @entity10 , to centralise in - patient dementia services there as part of a plan to create a ‘ centre of excellence for older people ’ and @entity33 is to be redeveloped as a community hub for mental health services in east @entity10			1
@entity17 's patient @entity4 has been moved seven times in a year from care homes to hospitals and hos wife @entity2 says she often finds him in tears mrs @entity55 say that although the care provided at @entity37 is good , the facilities are not and she questioned the judgement of moving patients away from a specially built facility			1
‘ @entity24 does not have the lovely facilities that this purpose - built building had			2
‘ i want to know why they are closing these places but then re-opening them to someone else			2
’ ‘ it ’s terrible			0
i know he ’s safe at @entity37 but it ’s only a stopping place			0
’ she said it was devastating to see the ‘ gentleman ’ with whom she has four children and share six grandchildren and two great grandchildren become a different person because of the disease			0
‘ even last year he would say “ i know it ’s hard for you			0
” ‘ then this plateau drops and their mind just goes			0
it ’s a horrible , nasty illness			0
’ change : @entity2 says her husband has been crippled by the ' horrible ' illness , right , and is not the gentleman he was , left a spokesman for @entity10 and @entity40 said : ‘ the service at @entity37 offers far more treatment and activity and has access to the skills and experience needed including medical and pharmacy provision			0
‘ the trust has also reinvested a large resource in both memory services , which will ensure that the need for beds reduces over time , and care home services , so staff can support those with more complex needs who go into long term care			0
‘ due to an increasingly ageing population we need to ensure we focus on earlier detection rather than waiting for people in crisis who then need a bed			0
’ the spokesman added that the trust accepted more could be done to improve facilities at @entity37			2
back in the days : @entity2 and @entity4 pictured in the seventies			0
