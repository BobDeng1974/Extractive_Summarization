@entity0 has a to - die - for job as personal chef to the @entity4 family but whipping up their meals is probably the least important part of his portfolio			1
mr @entity0 , 31 , also has a fancy title as @entity11 senior policy adviser for healthy food initiatives			1
that job has put him out front this month as the first lady marks the second anniversary of her campaign against childhood obesity			2
when mrs @entity4 was asked during a recent interview what was next for her ‘ @entity32 ’ initiative , she quickly passed the question to mr @entity0			1
‘ what you got ? ’ she demanded			0
‘ we 've got stuff , ’ he promised her			0
‘ you 're going to be busy			0
’ on a recent trip with mrs. @entity4 , the assistant @entity11 chef was seemingly everywhere : emceeing a ‘ @entity42 ’ school lunch competition , moderating a round - table discussion between the first lady and parents , briefing reporters on federal nutrition initiatives , and more			1
helping hand : mr @entity0 has travelled the country to promote @entity4 's eat - right - and - exercise - more message , one such appearances was on the reality series @entity42 ( shown above ) mr @entity0 , with his distinctive shaved head , wears a broad and relentless grin and speaks with an enthusiasm that 's infectious as he gives shout - outs to people and programs that are ‘ amazing , ’ ' incredible , ’ and ‘ powerful			1
’ he has a knack for popping out just the right statistics about obesity , nutrition and exercise			0
among the health - conscious recipes mr @entity0 has talked up in recent months : seared tilapia with fried rice and broccoli and carrots , garden herb - roasted chicken with braised greens , broccoli soup , sweet potatoes and greens , and cauliflower gratin			1
but no matter what his policy duties may be , five days a week mr @entity0 retrieves his chef 's coat in the afternoon and heads upstairs to fill the @entity83 ' plates with healthy and appealing meals at 6.30pm , when president @entity85 cuts short whatever 's afoot in the @entity87 to head home for dinner			1
there 's no need to consult with the first family on menu options — mr @entity0 knows their likes and dislikes by heart			1
mr @entity0 is discreet about what he feeds the family , often batting away questions with a ‘ top - secret ’ dodge			1
but he says the family ‘ walks the walk ’ on healthy foods , eating balanced meals often dictated by what 's in season in the @entity11 garden			1
with , of course , the occasional splurge to keep the kids happy			0
feeding the family : mr @entity0 ( second from left ) is discreet about what he feeds the family , but he says the family ¿ walks the walk ¿ on healthy foods , eating balanced meals often dictated by what 's in season in the @entity11 garden mrs. @entity4 , for her part , says her girls ‘ ca n't stay out of the kitchen when @entity0 is cooking			1
’ among the health - conscious recipes mr @entity0 has talked up in recent months : seared tilapia with fried rice and broccoli and carrots , garden herb - roasted chicken with braised greens , broccoli soup , sweet potatoes and greens , and cauliflower gratin			1
his healthy snack suggestions include warm grapefruit with honey , and banana boats stuffed with raisins , nuts and crushed whole grain cereal			2
the star power that comes with his chef 's jacket only helps reinforce mr @entity0 ' message about the importance of eating right			1
one minute he 's demonstrating how to make turkey lasagna with spinach on morning tv or chatting with @entity152 about healthy school lunches , and the next he 's discussing new standards to improve meals on military bases or working with @entity157 to reduce the sodium content in packaged foods			2
fresh produce : both mrs @entity4 and mr @entity0 ( pictured ) have been scheduling more public appearances of late since the first lady 's cook book will be released in april ‘ we 're seeing real changes , both big and small , happening all over the country , and incredible partnerships and people stepping up in ways that we just never could have foreseen , ’ mr @entity0 says			1
‘ and this kind of effort has just been inspirational and gives us a lot of hope that we can truly overcome these problems in the years to come			0
’ it 's a measure of mr @entity0 ' growing stature that he 's gone from @entity178 's ‘ most beautiful ’ list in his first year in @entity179 to @entity181 's ‘ most creative people in business ’ list in 2011			2
@entity184 , @entity185 restaurateur and co-host of @entity188 's ‘ top chef , ’ says mr @entity0 ' passion for healthy eating and knowledge of the issue make him a natural for his dual role			1
‘ he knows this stuff inside out , ’ mr @entity184 said			0
‘ it 's not him latching on to some trend			0
he 's taken the time to learn it and understand it			0
’ when more than 500 chefs gathered on the @entity11 lawn in 2010 to launch the ‘ @entity204 ’ program , pairing up chefs to work with individual schools , ‘ that came directly from @entity0 , ’ says mr @entity184			2
‘ this is something he cares deeply about			0
’ @entity209 , @entity11 chef for 11 years in the @entity211 and @entity212 administrations , says it 's a ‘ wonderful thing ’ that mr @entity0 ' cooking has become secondary to his policy work			1
‘ it 's way overdue that chefs be involved in that component , ’ says mr @entity209			0
while past @entity11 chefs might offer occasional behind - the - scenes advice on nutrition matters , mr @entity209 says , ‘ we were always thought of as , ' go back in the kitchen and be quiet			2
' ‘ mr @entity0 ' relationship with the @entity83 began when he cooked for the family in @entity226 before the 2008 elections			2
he was a history major in college , who discovered a love for cooking during a summer job at a @entity226 restaurant			0
he finished his college years abroad , and ended up training in @entity237 with an acclaimed @entity239 chef			2
hobnobbing with the stars : mrs @entity4 and mr @entity0 were featured with @entity242 football player @entity241 ( centre ) when the appeared on @entity184 's reality show @entity42 where they prepared healthy meals for students back in @entity226 ( where his schoolteacher father taught @entity83 in fifth grade ) mr @entity0 worked at the @entity250 restaurant @entity251 before opening a private chef business , inevitable table , that promotes ‘ a healthy lifestyle that focuses on the quality and flavour of food to encourage good eating habits			1
’ these days , mr @entity0 mixes plenty of cooking with his advocacy : he 's fixed honey crisp apple salad at the @entity263 cafeteria , served @entity152 a burrito bulging with peppers , lettuce , rice and beans , and prepared @entity270 chard frittatas for children on the @entity11 lawn			2
he does n't see much of his basement apartment as he juggles the roles of cook , policy wonk and family friend — even golfing with the president when the family vacations on @entity280 and in @entity281			0
he 's also a big advocate for the @entity11 garden , often helping troupes of schoolchildren harvest its bounty and teaching them about healthy eating			2
encouraging good behaviour : mrs @entity4 convinced tv host @entity290 ( who has notoriously bad eating habits ) to try a vegetable pizza as a part of her campaign for a healthy eating initiative that she has worked on with mr @entity0 at a child obesity conference last summer in @entity297 , mr @entity0 told about fretting over nightmare scenarios before hosting a group of schoolchildren for a summer harvest of broccoli , kale and other vegetables — an event that was to be observed by a sizeable press corps			1
he worried about the fallout if just one child set a vegetables - are - yucky tone that would derail the event			0
‘ i did n't sleep at all the night before , ’ he confessed			0
‘ one kid with some broccoli that they did n't like would be a national disaster for us			0
... everything we 're doing would 've been set back two years			0
’ instead , mr @entity0 found himself having to rein in a girl who sneaked off to a back bench to stuff her face with fresh - cut cauliflower			1
‘ it 's the only time in my professional career that i 've ever had to ask a child to please put the vegetables back on the plate , ’ he recalled to laughter , before turning serious			0
‘ these kids were engaged in some part of the process of what it meant to grow and eat food , ’ he said			0
‘ and that little thing is absolutely critical to making the connection and having the foundation that kids will build on in the future to live healthier lives			0
