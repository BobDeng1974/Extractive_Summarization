it is a temptation to which most male motorists have surely succumbed			0
but for @entity7 , taking his eye off the road to steal a glance at an attractive female pedestrian has landed him with a £ 60 fine – after his sneaky look was caught on police camera			1
officers said he was driving without due care and attention , but the 26 - year - old complained : ‘ nicking another bloke for looking at a pretty girl is no way to earn a living			1
’ ' the girl was a cracker ' : @entity7 ( pictured ) has been fined £ 60 after being pulled over by police for taking his eye off the road to steal a glance at an attractive female pedestrian as he drove past he added : ‘ the girl had a very nice backside and i wanted to check out her face to see if it was as nice as her figure			1
it ’s what practically every bloke on the planet would do			0
’ mr @entity7 admits that the photographic evidence shows him leaning over and staring out of the back window , having driven past the good - looking stranger – but he insists he was in full control of his car			1
he said : ‘ i saw a police car parked about 150 yards down the road but i did n’t think anything of it as the road was empty and i was in complete control of my vehicle as far as i was concerned			1
i was n’t leaning out of the window shouting and wolf - whistling either			2
’ nevertheless , he attracted the attention of the officers stationed on the @entity48 at @entity49 , @entity50 , who pulled him over and showed him the image they had taken from their dashboard camera			1
head - turner : mr @entity7 said he was always in full control of his car while catching a glance at the woman ( not pictured ) ‘ it was a really high - quality picture of me leaning across the seat of my vehicle , ’ he said			1
‘ they said that my behaviour constituted driving without due care and attention			1
‘ they told me that if i agreed , i could have a fixed penalty fine and would have to attend four hours of driving awareness courses			2
otherwise i would be summonsed and then i ’d get points on my licence too			0
of course , i took the fixed penalty and the driving course			2
‘ unless you ’re wealthy and have the resources to challenge these things you just have to go with the flow			0
’ mr @entity7 , a gunsmith , added : ‘ the girl was a cracker , but it was n’t worth getting a £ 60 fine for			1
’ however , he claimed that it was ‘ a matter of opinion ’ whether his actions were dangerous , saying : ‘ i would argue that i can do two things at once and am an experienced driver			0
they would argue that they ’re keeping death off the road			0
’ he added that the object of his attention ‘ must have walked past while i was being reprimanded – though i was n’t looking at her by then			2
if she realised what happened i expect she had a good laugh			2
’ mr @entity7 also claimed one of the policemen had been distracted by the woman			1
‘ while they were doing the paperwork one of them , who seemed more human than the other , said something like , “ i had a good look at her too			0
she was a bit of a cracker			0
” ‘ “ there you go , ” i said			0
“ you had a bit of a look at her as well – why should n’t i ? ” ‘ “ he was n’t driving , ” said the other one , who was having a bit of a break from his sense of humour			0
’ after the incident , mr @entity7 posted on his @entity125 page : ‘ camera footage was good – me looking across and out back window getting a good eyeful			1
’ one of his friends responded : ‘ that ’ll teach you for being a dirty old perv then , eh ? ’ a @entity134 police spokesman said : ‘ we have n’t processed this penalty notice yet so we can not comment on this particular incident			0
‘ however , we would remind motorists they have a duty not to be distracted by anything at all , not just gorgeous people , and so lose concentration while they are driving			0
