@entity0 has poured cold water on any lingering hope that @entity3 may spring a surprise at next year 's @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7			1
the 41 - year - old , speaking at @entity8 during the launch of his new autobiography ' @entity12 ' , does n't see @entity15 's side competing @entity16 in february			1
@entity3 face @entity17 in a triangular series in @entity6 ahead of february 's showpiece - one they are expected to struggle in given the turmoil to have engulfed the team over the last 12 months			1
@entity23 ( left ) and @entity3 captain @entity24 celebrate the test series win over @entity17 in august but @entity24 and coach @entity15 ( right ) are not expected to make @entity3 competitive at the @entity5 and @entity0 - almost a year to the day since his final test match against the @entity27 - ca n’t think of any reason for those gloomy predictions to be wrong			1
' i do n't think so , sorry , ' he said when asked of @entity3 's chances			1
' anything is possible in this sport but going by the current form i do n't think @entity3 will be that competitive			1
’ they are in disarray having won just one one - day international series this year - that came against the equally shambolic @entity27 in march - and serious questions remain over who will make the plane or whether captain @entity24 should be on it			2
@entity45 coach @entity44 is even plotting their downfall when the sides meet on february 23 in @entity49			0
' i ca n't pinpoint one team but there are a few competitive teams			0
i 'd like to name @entity6 , @entity53 ... @entity7 are a dark horse			1
i think these four would be my semi-finalists , ’ @entity0 added			2
' i feel @entity17 can surprise a lot of guys and believe the spinners will come into play			2
you talk about pitches conducive to fast bowlers but because of the size of the grounds i think spinners will come into it			0
’ his book is dedicated to ' all of my fellow @entity70 ' and the former batsman speaks glowingly about the emergence of the @entity73 - although admitting initial doubts over its legitimacy in terms of quality - while also documenting the anguish he felt in search of a hundredth 100			0
the varying merits of the three formats have been hotly debated in his homeland , but @entity0 - who has scored more runs and centuries than anyone else - left it in no doubt his preferred form			2
@entity0 was speaking at his book launch in @entity92 in @entity93 on friday it has been a year since @entity17 legend @entity0 retired from cricket after a lengthy career ' @entity97 will always be right at the top , ' he added			1
' i think for @entity97 we had some decent crowds			0
if you go to most of the players they will back test cricket as no 1			1
' @entity106 has opened up a bigger audience			0
' somebody who likes @entity106 can be converted			0
' its impossible to keep each format a popular as each other			0
@entity106 is exciting and allows you to be innovative			0
in test cricket batsmen are prepared to play reverse sweeps			1
i do n't remember anyone bowling slower ball bouncers in the 90s			0
' @entity0 made it clear he had not published a book in order to create headlines and had just one line on @entity125 's recently - published autobiography : ' i think certain things should stay in the dressing room			2

@entity0 does n't see @entity3 being *contenders* at the @entity5
@entity15 ' travel to @entity6 for the *tournament* in february
@entity3 face @entity17 in triangular series ahead of the @entity5
@entity0 believes that test cricket will always be more *important* than *t20*
