it is not very often that you can get a camera this close to deadly molten lava - especially while it oozes into the @entity6			1
however , a 51 - year - old extreme landscape photographer from @entity8 braved the rough waters during a brief period of calm and managed to capture the @entity13 volcano eruption in all its glory			1
the stunning footage - taken somewhere in between @entity16 and the @entity17 , off the coast of the @entity19 - is almost therapeutic to watch as fiery fluid plunges underwater where it will transform into land			1
a hot situation : @entity24 from the erupting @entity13 volcano pours into the @entity6 off @entity8 recalling his time filming the scene in april 2013 , @entity26 says : ' on this particular day the ocean was fairly calm and my window of opportunity was there , so i took it			1
' you can also see this crazy thrill - seeking kayaker in the foreground			2
he probably was saying the same thing about me : " who 's that crazy dude with the camera ? "			0
' @entity43 matter is hotter than 1,650 degrees @entity44 ) , according to the @entity45			0
surrounded by clouds of poisonous smoke in the clip , the way the lava drools from @entity13 looks like something from the set of @entity53			1
seizing the opportunity : @entity55 photographer @entity26 took advantage of the waters being calmer than normal and waded in to produce this footage in april 2013 daredevil : the 51 - year - old remained only a short distance from the lava flow and made sure to wear protective gear to prevent burning it 's amazing to think that this hyperactive volcano - the youngest on @entity8 's @entity19 - has been erupting continuously since 1983			1
indeed , the way that the bright orange liquid contrasts against the blue palette of the ocean and sky , makes for one of the most powerful and picturesque visions that nature has to offer			0
speaking to @entity75 , @entity26 remembers just how difficult it was to get close to lava and the importance of keeping safe by staying ' on top of your game '			2
the daredevil says : ' the videos can only show you so much , but to actually be there , to feel the heat			0
... the heat is one thing , but the gases are extremely toxic			2
' however , @entity26 is very experienced in his field and owns all the right gear - including fireproof boots and long - sleeved clothing to prevent severe burning			0
' sometimes , after a day of filming , i shake my head and think , man , that was pretty stupid to do what i just did , ' he adds			2
' still , that 's not going to stop me from doing what i want to do			0
' ' sometimes i think that was pretty stupid ! ' looking back , the @entity104 local can not believe some of the dangerous situations he puts himself into			0

@entity13 volcano is one of the most active on @entity111 and has been erupting for over *30* years
