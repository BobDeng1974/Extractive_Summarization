all @entity0 would be better off if the top rate of income tax was returned to eisenhower - era levels of about 90 per cent , economists have claimed			1
the recommendation would more than double the current top @entity0 rate of income tax - 39.6 per cent - and runs counter to more than two decades of economic orthodoxy			1
at the moment fewer than one per cent of @entity0 reach the top income tax bracket of $ 406,750 for individuals and $ 457,600 for couples , yet the topic is one of the most emotive in @entity0 politics			1
post-war consensus : president @entity18 presided over a successful @entity0 economy in which high taxation was seen as normal practise for those earning incomes far above the national average low rates : this graph shows how the @entity0 income tax rate has fluctuated in the past century @entity28 from the @entity29 and @entity30 from the @entity31 make the case for radically higher rates of taxation in a new paper published by the @entity36			1
their conclusions come nearly 25 years after the idea that the wealthy should be allowed to keep as much of their money as possible became the accepted political norm			0
beginning with the presidency of @entity44 , spurred by the new ideology of neoliberalism , the @entity0 saw radical cuts to the top rate of income tax until it fell to less than 30 per cent			1
the architects of these policies were spurred by ideologues like the radical capitalist @entity53 , an originator of the ' wealth creator ' myth , who believed rational self - interest would create the most - perfect economic conditions			1
taking money out of the hands of the rich was not only unjust , she and her acolytes believed , but also economically illiterate , since those who were best at making money would know the best way to spend it			2
but as dr @entity28 and dr @entity30 point out , these tax cuts coincided with a spike in inequality , with the total share of @entity0 household income accruing to the top 1 per cent doubling between the early 1970s and 2007			1
since the 2008 financial crisis and banking bail - out , inequality has soared more than ever , leading to calls from from academic economists and street - level protesters alike for something to be done to reverse it			1
radical right : @entity53 , an originator of the ' wealth creator ' myth , who believed rational self - interest would create the most - perfect economic conditions of course , no - one wants to hand 90 per cent of their income over to the federal government			1
but much of this fear stems from a misunderstanding of how marginal tax rates work			2
if you make $ 500,000 and are subject to a 90 per cent marginal tax rate , that does n't mean you are going to pay $ 450,000 in tax			2
what it means is you pay 90 per cent tax on every dollar you earn over the threshold of $ 406,750			2
if you make $ 500,000 that means you pay the top rate on your final $ 93,250 of income			2
the researchers come to their conclusions after some 30 pages of complex economic calculations which they say models ' a quantitative overlapping generations economy '			2
they claim that ' in the model the top 1 per cent [ of earners ] look exactly as in the data , at least with respect to their key economic characteristics			0
' running their model , dr @entity28 and dr @entity30 conclude a tax rate of 90 per cent or higher on the top band of earners would not only decrease inequalities in both income and wealth , but also increase everyone 's well - being - even those paying the new tax			1
in essence , dr @entity30 told @entity127 , such a high tax would ' provide social insurance against not making it into the 1 per cent			0
' in the paper he and dr @entity28 write that ' such high marginal tax rates provide optimal social insurance in a world where very high labour incomes are generated by rare ( but somewhat persistent ) earnings opportunity			1
' there is a caveat			0
it is argued that higher marginal tax rates would not discourage the enterprising and entrepreneurial from wanting to work as hard at making money			1
this is precisely the contention of @entity53 and her acolytes			0
in her bestselling novel , @entity144 , @entity53 imagines a dystopia where successful industrialists abandon their fortunes in response to aggressive regulations			0
the result of this capital strike is that most vital industries collapse , leaving the nation in ruins , until the wealthy ride to the rescue and reorganise society along the lines of @entity53 's ' rational selfishness '			0
but dr @entity28 and dr @entity30 counter that such an eventually is unlikely , because even those among us who are unusually talented have only a limited window of opportunity to exploit their abilities			0
they have only a few years to use their skills to make all the money they can			0
as dr @entity30 told the @entity127 : ' how much less hard would @entity170 play basketball if he were taxed at a much higher rate ? ' the answer , the economist says , is not much			0
with only five or so years of peak earning potential the basketballer will work to earn as much as he possibly can in that time			0
the question , of course , is : would @entity180 or @entity181 behave the same way ? and would it matter if they did n't ?			0

economists ' paper calls for return to eisenhower - era rates of income tax
higher rates would benefit all @entity0 , even the rich , it is claimed
recommendation runs counter to two decades of economic orthodoxy
