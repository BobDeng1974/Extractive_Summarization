his first - person account of a 19th - century massacre in @entity3 helped to close one of the continent 's most notorious slave markets			1
but researchers now believe legendary explorer dr @entity8 may not have been telling the whole truth			2
using a procedure known as spectral imaging , an international team of academics believe they have decoded his long - illegible field diary and say it hints that his own men may have participated in the atrocity			1
hidden account : dr @entity8 's 1871 field diary was written using bank checks , aging pieces of newsprint ink made from seeds and berries , rendering it illegible until it was recently analysed with a spectrograph ( below ) untruths uncovered ? researchers claim that discrepancies between dr @entity8 's original account of the massacre and the field diary suggests he has something to hide about the atrocity @entity37 of @entity38 , who directed the project , said : ' @entity8 's party might have been involved in the massacre			1
' but he advised caution : ' we 're only beginning to analyze the evidence			2
' it 's an explosive claim because @entity8 's account of the horror seen in the @entity50 village of @entity51 galvanized @entity53 authorities to shut the slave market in @entity55 , a critical hub for @entity3 's human traffickers			1
@entity8 himself denied allegations that his men had been involved			2
and while @entity8 biographer @entity61 praised @entity37 's efforts , he said he was skeptical that the @entity64 missionary would have tried to cover up his party 's role in the killings			0
' nobody can know for sure , but i do n't think the proof is there , ' mr @entity61 said			0
regardless of the exact circumstances , the @entity51 massacre was one of the darkest points of @entity8 's career			1
in his posthumously published ' @entity77 , ' @entity8 described how a ' bright , sultry summer morning ' in july 1871 had turned to hell when slavers opened fire on some 1,500 people at @entity51 's market			1
horror : an illustration of the @entity87 at @entity51 in which slavers opened fire on 1,500 people at a market in @entity55			1
the atrocity was one of the darkest points of dr @entity8 's career @entity93 broke out as the marketgoers , many of them women , scrambled for their canoes or tried to swim across the nearby @entity96			1
' shot after shot continued to be fired on the helpless and perishing , ' @entity8 said , describing how many others drowned in the river			0
' some of the long line of heads disappeared quietly ; whilst other poor creatures threw their arms high , as if appealing to the great father above , and sank			0
' @entity8 said he could n't know how many had died , although he cited estimates running into the hundreds			0
when news of the massacre reached @entity53 , it ignited a wave of revulsion			2
by 1873 , the @entity53 consul had pressured the sultan of @entity55 to close the island 's large slave market			1
@entity8 's account was first communicated to the outside world by journalist @entity119 , whose famous encounter with the explorer in october 1871 was immortalized by the words : ' @entity8 , i presume ? ' later works , including the ' @entity77 ' , were based on the journal that @entity8 wrote in 1872 , after @entity119 had resupplied him with paper			0
famous meeting : dr @entity8 's account was first relayed to the world by journalist @entity119 , whose encounter with the explorer in october 1871 was immortalised by the phrase : ' @entity8 , i presume ? ' but it 's @entity8 's field diary , improvised from bank checks and aging pieces of newsprint and written in ink made from seeds and berries , which @entity37 claims as evidence for his theory that @entity8 's men were involved in the massacre			1
the raw notes have long been considered unreadable - a result of the unusual writing material , the tropical weather , and the unorthodox ink			2
but @entity37 's team submitted the notes to spectrographic analysis			0
the field diary makes clear that @entity8 - an ardent abolitionist - was horrified by the moral character of the freed slaves sent to reinforce his expedition			1
he describes them as ' senseless slaves with no honor			0
' in @entity8 's account , they emerge as rebellious and violent - at one point he confides that ' if they go anywhere , i must go with them or murder is certain			2
' in another passage , dated may 18 , @entity8 says the slaves have mutinied and bought guns with his money			0
those passages were either sanitized or excised from @entity8 's 1872 journal			0
@entity37 claimed that the edits , combined with discrepancies between the field diary and the journal 's descriptions of the massacre , suggest @entity8 may have had something to hide about the bloody incident			1
mr @entity61 acknowledged that the slaves were ' clearly very disobedient and violent men , ' but said it was unlikely that they would have gone on a rampage in @entity8 's presence			0
followers of the great explorer can decide for themselves			0
scans and transcripts of the diary have been posted to the website of the @entity191 , @entity192 .			0
