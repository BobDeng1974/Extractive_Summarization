@entity0 the @entity1 by by @entity2 as there are already ‘ many tens of thousands ’ of books on @entity0 , and 33,000 extant letters and memoranda by him to consult in the @entity10 archives , @entity2 will have to concede that the trajectory of his subject ’s life and career , from @entity16 upbringing to meeting his @entity17 at , er , @entity17 , is pretty well known			1
never before , however , has the scope and sweep been encapsulated so cogently in a single volume — even if it is a veritably @entity0 volume of 1,000 pages , needing its own lectern			1
@entity2 has a superb eye for detail and useless facts			0
@entity27 , for example , is ill - named , as the @entity28 never drank spirits			1
on the other hand , he took 800,000 pints of red wine with him to @entity32			1
though @entity0 is credited with inventing the @entity34 , not many people know he set up the @entity35 — the sapeurs - pompiers — or that he introduced street lighting in @entity37			1
he was considered a monstrous figure in @entity45 — @entity0 as a bogey - man — yet @entity48 had a snuffbox with his portrait on it , @entity46 built a replica of his coach , and lord @entity54 , the prime minister , wrote odes about him			1
@entity0 ’s cure for piles was to apply leeches to his bottom			1
he was clearly a brave man			0
‘ i am the revolution ! ’ @entity0 had exclaimed , and @entity2 ’s book backs up the boast			1
after his first few military victories , ‘ i no longer regarded myself as a simple general , ’ the character whom his troops affectionately called ‘ the little corporal ’ stated , ‘ but as a man called upon to decide the fate of peoples			2
’ @entity0 was a veritable force of destiny — his megalomania was a foretaste of @entity77 ’s			1
@entity2 , however , is at pains to make us appreciate @entity0 ’s more humane achievements			1
he abolished the @entity82 and anti-semitic regulations ; he got rid of feudal practices and restraints on trade imposed by guilds , for example			0
insisting on ‘ equality before the law ’ in civil and criminal actions , @entity0 drew up legislation to protect citizens from arbitrary arrest			1
he protected property rights and codified inheritance decrees			0
he gave better pay , conditions and pensions to soldiers			0
he instituted an educational system based on merit , not the privileges of birth			0
@entity0 was a veritable force of destiny — his megalomania was a foretaste of @entity77 ’s all well and good — but for @entity0 , warfare was his preferred element , not a legislative chamber or committee room			1
he was never more down in the dumps than when he told @entity112 : ‘ my enemies are defeated , thrashed , in full rout			2
’ he did n’t much like @entity10 , a place ‘ he had come to equate with corruption , disloyalty , heartache , secret malice and the potential for deep embarrassment ’			2
how much more wholesome , manly , psychologically cleaner and fresher , by contrast , was a battlefield , with its displays of sheer courage and strategic ingenuity			0
as a military cadet , where he ’d excelled in maths and ballistics , @entity0 learned the arts of musketry , drills and horsemanship			2
he early in life formed ‘ a strong belief ’ in the virtues of brute force			1
‘ one can not remain three minutes without gunpowder , ’ was his philosophy , and his tutors thought him ‘ blunt in manners , bold , enterprising and even ferocious ’			1
his first major action was at @entity145 , where by ‘ hectoring , bluster , requisitioning and political string - pulling ’ he pounded the @entity45 fleet with cannon and mortars			1
@entity0 was a brigadier - general by the age of 24			1
he went on to fight more than 60 pitched battles , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 among them , and blow me down with a feather if @entity2 does n’t give an account of every single one , with maps , diagrams and in prose of much wit and total clarity			2
so what if 18,000 men lost their lives in a campaign ? @entity0 could rely on 50,000 fresh conscripts each year			2
he understood ‘ the psychology of the average soldier ’ — their need for songs , mottoes , medals , ‘ small things that helped breed devotion ’ and ensured the @entity171			2
much of the army ’s time was spent fighting and re-fighting the @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			0
@entity0 was an expert at playing allies off against each other , drawing up treaties that would then be breached and give him further excuses for war			2
continuous conflict ensured there was a steady stream of pictures , statues and furniture from conquered cities making its way to @entity10 — loot for the @entity200			0
@entity0 invaded @entity32 to annexe the @entity201 and ‘ damage @entity45 trade in the region ’			1
for @entity0 , warfare was his preferred element , not a legislative chamber or committee room he went to @entity209 to steal their ships , with which he ’d planned to invade @entity213 — as with @entity77 , a long - gestated and unfulfilled dream			1
‘ good and upstanding people must be persuaded by gentle means , ’ he murmured			2
‘ the rabble must be moved by terror			0
’ as dictators throughout history always realise , terror tactics work best			0
‘ bloodletting is among the ingredients of political medicine , ’ he believed			2
he used grapeshot on civilians and ordered massacres and village burnings			0
it was @entity0 ’s policy to execute influential inhabitants , ‘ at least one of whom must be a lawyer ’			1
well , most of us will be with him there			0
at one town he took in the @entity244 , even he was a little taken aback , however , at ‘ the sound of shots , shrieking of women and fathers , piles of bodies , a daughter being raped on the cadaver of her mother , the smell of blood , the groans of the wounded ’			2
yet how else really , he reasoned , could you ‘ secure tranquillity ’ ? poetic justice of a kind came about in @entity255			2
the @entity256 caught the plague from the locals			0
soldiers were ‘ covered with foam and the disgusting evacuations of abscessed buboes ’			2
at @entity156 , 60,000 cannonballs were fired			1
there were 43,000 immediate casualties and 140,000 further deaths from wounds and disease , statistics that would remain a record until @entity271 the march on @entity273 and the subsequent retreat in sub-zero temperatures is another horrific episode , ‘ reminiscent of @entity278 ’s depiction of @entity279 ’ , to which @entity2 gives the full tolstoyan treatment			1
at @entity156 , 60,000 cannonballs were fired			1
there were 43,000 immediate casualties and 140,000 further deaths from wounds and disease , statistics that would remain a record until @entity271 to put this in perspective , @entity2 says it was like a @entity289 crashing with no survivors every five minutes for ten hours solid into an area six miles square			1
a quarter of a million horses were taken on the @entity184 adventure , 10,000 expiring in the very first week from a combination of dehydration and a diet of wet grass			0
@entity0 himself went through five mounts a week , exhausting them ‘ in quick succession ’ as he ‘ bowled unstoppably along a narrow valley gorge ’			1
no wonder he had piles			0
it was clear to anyone that @entity0 was driven by an ambition ‘ full of zeal and fire ’ and that one day he ’d run the whole show in @entity256 if not @entity312 and the whole world it was clear to anyone that @entity0 was driven by an ambition ‘ full of zeal and fire ’ and that one day he ’d run the whole show in @entity256 if not @entity312 and the whole world			1
having been elected first consul in 1799 , he soon became @entity320 and then @entity28			0
his costume at his coronation included a gold laurel - wreath that evoked @entity324			0
like the guillotined @entity325 , he took up residence in the @entity327 and went in for flunkeys , grandeur and elaborate display			0
his wife @entity112 ’s dress bills were bigger than @entity332 ’s			0
@entity0 was not such a tactical genius with his lady friends			0
his first paramour was the 16 - year - old @entity336 , daughter of ‘ a dead royalist textile and soap millionaire ’			1
her rejection of him ‘ contributed to his deep cynicism about women and even about love itself ’			0
@entity112 , or the @entity345 - @entity344 for short , had blackened stubs for teeth , the result of chewing raw sugar in @entity350 as a child			0
her detractors called her ‘ a cajoling courtesan ’ , and @entity0 thought her ‘ frivolous , capricious and giddy ’ , so he married her in 1796			1
it was not the great romance of legend			0
@entity0 did n’t seem to mind that she took lovers , one immediately after their marriage			0
he was seldom at their home in @entity10 , preferring to invade @entity184 than the bedchamber			0
after the defeat by @entity364 at @entity17 , in 1815 , @entity0 wanted to settle in the @entity365 , where he ’d no doubt have started up again			0
instead , he was banished 4,400 miles away to the humid island of @entity367 , where it was so damp his playing cards stuck together unless kept in the oven — one of the typical small details that makes @entity2 ’s book an epic joy .			0

@entity27 is ill - named , as the @entity28 never drank spirits
on the other hand , he took 800,000 pints of red wine with him to @entity32
@entity0 was a veritable force of destiny
his megalomania was a foretaste of @entity77 ’s
warfare was his preferred element , not a committee room
at @entity156 , 60,000 cannonballs were fired . there were 43,000 casualties
these statistics would remain a record until @entity271
it was clear that @entity0 was driven by an ambition ‘ full of zeal and fire ’
