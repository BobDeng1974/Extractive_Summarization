with lager companies now also looking to capitalise on the growth in the @entity8 cider market , the nation ’s desire for the fruity drink shows no signs of losing fizz just yet			1
according to latest research from market analysts @entity21 , three in five adults now drink cider , significantly up from the previous year ’s total of 47 per cent			1
this progress means that in 2012 , a greater share of adults drank cider than spirits			1
cider is even closing in on beer in terms of usage , a market which has struggled to retain its base of drinkers in recent years , standing at 70 per cent in 2012			1
while its recent successes have helped a number of cider producers to grow rapidly , @entity21 research shows that the market ’s future prospects could be equally positive as , even among cider drinkers , 23 per cent state that it does not always occur to them to drink it			1
@entity45 , senior drinks analyst at @entity21 said : ' cider continues to stand out as one of the star performers among alcoholic drinks markets			2
' usage has flourished in recent years as the market has improved its image , with strong growth at the premium tier			0
' the market has also performed well on the back of its accessibility , with its accessible flavour profiles helping to attract new users such as women and 18 - 34 year - olds			0
' while many drinks markets are struggling to grow in real terms and are also hampered by the government ’s tax escalator , cider is one of the anomalous success stories which is also showing underlying volume growth			2
' cider is in fact one of the few success stories in the alcohol market , achieving steady growth despite the economic downturn			2

big business : drinkers spent £ 2.7billion on cider in the @entity8 last year over the last five years sales of cider have increased by 32 per cent to reach £ 2.7 billion in 2012 , up from £ 1.8 billion in 2007 and with sales increasing 5 per cent in the last year alone			1
meanwhile volume sales have posted slower growth , although the market still managed overall growth of 18 per cent between 2007 and 2012			0
the success of cider looks set to continue in the coming years , with new producers continuing to build momentum and with strong consumer demand leading to a better range of ciders in both the on - and off - trade sales channels			0
over the next five years , @entity21 forecasts that the market will reach sales of £ 3.7 billion , driven partly by duty increases but also growing user numbers			0
while apple remains the nation ’s favourite flavour of cider , drunk by 47 per cent of adults , there are striking signs of growth coming from the pear and flavoured segments			2
pear has grown to be a firm favourite amongst cider drinkers , and is drunk by almost four in ten adults , buoyed by the emergence of brands such as @entity115 and @entity116			1
@entity117 : @entity118 remains the nation 's favourite flavour of cider though pear is becoming increasingly liked meanwhile , almost a quarter of @entity124 have drunk any other type of fruit - flavoured cider , with flavours in this adventurous segment ranging from cloudberry to toffee apple			0
' pear cider is now a highly profitable segment of the market and one which producers should almost be prioritising on a par with apple cider , ' @entity45 continues			0
' while apple continues to drive most of the sales , pear can also be an effective gateway into the market , with a particular appeal to female drinkers			0
' however , pear is still underperforming in terms of appealing to older drinkers and operators may be well served in highlighting features such as a @entity8 heritage and ingredient quality to appeal to these more traditional cider drinkers			1
' while the cider market continues to make great strides , there are still a number of challenges for producers to overcome			0
many of these relate to its image as amongst lager , wine and @entity165 drinkers , just 8 per cent think that cider is sophisticated while 14 per cent think that it is worth paying more for , both of which are significantly behind associations with wine .			2
