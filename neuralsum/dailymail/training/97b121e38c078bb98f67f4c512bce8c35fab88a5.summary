an experimental spaceplane has successfully launched after a minor delay			2
@entity2 launched its unmanned @entity3 ( @entity3 ) on a @entity6 rocket from @entity7 in @entity8 at 1340 gmt today			1
the initial launch was postponed after an unidentified problem with the launch complex			1
it is now on a flight that will last slightly more than 100 minutes , during which time it will re-enter @entity15 's atmosphere to test new technologies			2
the craft is being fired 256 miles ( 412km ) into the @entity15 's atmosphere in the first test flight of technology that could lead to new re-usable spacecraft for use on future missions to @entity23			1
@entity2 launched its unmanned @entity3 ( @entity3 ) on a @entity6 rocket from @entity8 at 1340 gmt today ( still image from live stream video shown ) the 16ft ( five metres ) long spaceplane separated from the @entity6 rocket at an altitude of 210 miles ( 340km ) above the @entity15 before climbing to its maximum altitude			1
it is due to fly east for around 20,000 miles ( 32,000km ) during the 100 - minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere at a rapid 16,800mph ( 27 000 km / h )			1
during this time it will navigate through the atmosphere using ' flaps ' at its back , controlling its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space			0
if it passes this test , it will then splash down in the @entity54 at the end of the flight			0
@entity3 will be launched into a suborbital path by a @entity6 rocket launched from @entity60 â€™s @entity59 in @entity61 in february 11			1
@entity3 will separate from @entity6 at an altitude of 210 miles ( 340 km )			1
@entity3 will coast to up to 256 miles ( 412km ) and then begin its re-entry phase , recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors			1
the entry speed of 4.6 miles per second ( 7.5 km / s ) at an altitude of 75 miles ( 120 km ) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit			0
@entity3 will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the @entity54			2
engineers at @entity2 hope to use the craft , which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings , to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to @entity15			2
it could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of @entity23 in future missions and then return samples to @entity15			2
@entity94 , @entity2 project manager for the @entity3 , said : ' reentry is something we need to achieve if one day we want to have the ambition of having astronauts flying back to @entity15 with @entity60 technologies			1
' @entity3 will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new @entity60 re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a safe splashdown in the @entity54			1
the @entity107 recovery vessel will be used to retrieve the spacecraft			0
over the last month , the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting @entity3 out of the water			0
the 16ft ( five metres ) long spaceplane separated from the @entity6 ( shown just after launch ) at an altitude of 210 miles ( 340km ) above the @entity15 before climbing to its maximum altitude			1
it is due to fly east for around 20,000 miles ( 32,000km ) during the 100 - minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere the two - piece shell of @entity6 opened to release the space plane at an altitude of about 200 miles ( 320 km )			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of various stage of the test flight developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ( $ 225 million ) , the @entity3 is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on @entity15 after a mission to space			1
this could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the @entity136 ( @entity136 )			0
the only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the @entity136 and back is @entity139 's @entity138			0
speaking to the @entity140 , mr @entity94 said : ' @entity60 is excellent at going to orbit ; we have all the launchers , for example			0
' we also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit			0
but where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit			0
' so , if we are to close the circle - go to orbit , stay in orbit , come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations			0
' engineers at @entity2 hope to use the craft ( illustration shown ) , which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings , to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to @entity15			2
it could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of @entity23 in future missions and return samples to @entity15 scientists have filled the @entity3 with sensors to monitor how the materials and flight systems cope during the launch			1
after separating from the spacerocket , the @entity3 was travelling at hypersonic speeds of 9,562mph ( 15,389km/h )			0
it climbed further through the atmosphere before lowering and dipping its nose to begin re-entry			0
during the descent , the heat shields designed to protect the spaceplne will reach temperatures of up to 1,700 degrees c ( 3,100 degree f ) flaps and thrusters will help control the vehicle as it descends , ensuring it comes down at a pre-arranged landing site			0
just before landing a parachute system will deploy to allow the two tonne vechile to land gently in the @entity54 where airbags will deploy to keep it from sinking			0
a recovery ship will be waiting nearby - around 1,800 miles west of the coast of the @entity195			0
as it makes its way through the atmosphere , @entity3 will use ' flaps ' at its back to control its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space , such as @entity206 's recent @entity205 spacecraft			1
if it passes this test , it will then splash down in the @entity54 at the end of the flight last year @entity2 used a prototype of the @entity3 to practice recovering it from the ocean			2
an attempt to launch the @entity3 last november was postponed by engineers to allow additional analysis of the rockets trajectory to be conducted			2
last year saw two major setbacks for the space industry			0
on october 28 , an @entity219 rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the @entity136 this was followed three days later by the crash of @entity227 tourist space plane @entity225 on a test flight , killing one of two pilots			2
last year @entity2 used a prototype of the @entity3 to practice recovering it from the ocean , shown in this image the @entity3 spaceplane can be seen above on top of @entity2 's @entity6 rocket on the launch pad in @entity8 the @entity3 space plane as it is encased in its farings that will protect the experimental craft during the launch the graphic above explains the different stages that will occur during the test flight of the @entity3 space plane			1

the @entity3 successfully took off at 1340 gmt
lift - off was initially delayed after an unidentified launch complex problem
the space plane launched on a @entity6 rocket from @entity8
it was carried 210 miles above @entity15 before firing its own thrusters
now it is climbing to a maximum altitude of 256 miles ( 412km ) before it begins its *daring* re-entry attempt through the atmosphere
it will travel around 20,000 miles before splashing into the @entity54
a ship is *standing* by to recover the craft once it touches down in the sea
if successful the @entity3 could lead to @entity60 's first reentry space vehicle
technology will be used to build re-usable spacecraft for missions to @entity23
