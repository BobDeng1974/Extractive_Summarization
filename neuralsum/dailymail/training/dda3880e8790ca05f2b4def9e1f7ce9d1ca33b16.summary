' she ’ll only eat top of the range dry cat food			2
the more expensive the better			0

her paws are intended to walk only on the finest wool carpets			0
@entity48 loves being groomed in a steam filled fragrant bathroom , and particularly likes @entity128 or @entity129 ' despite a collection of toys such as stuffed frogs and mice , madam will only play with @entity136 catnip mice at £ 4 pop.

@entity15 said : ' i ’ve got a @entity156 sweatshirt , which i made into a cushion for her to recline on while she listens to the radio			2
' i always have to wear the same perfume as @entity130 has poor eyesight			0
she will then know it is me in the room , or approaching her			0
i wore @entity166 when i rehomed her , and thus now have to wear it always when in her presence			0

she likes @entity128 or @entity174			0
she loves being groomed in a steam filled fragrant bathroom			0
' she sometimes gets rather miffed when i go out , especially if she can tell i ’ve been drinking			0

@entity15 said : ' @entity189 fans send items which she models and send a photo back with a letter of thanks			2
