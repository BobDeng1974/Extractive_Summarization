@entity0 go into wednesday night 's @entity2 game against @entity3 knowing that only a win - and a win in which they score twice - will be enough to secure progress			1
it might therefore worry them to know that beating @entity3 is something that their manager , @entity11 , has failed to manage since 2008			2
@entity11 has now managed three clubs without any successes against @entity3 , losing all of his games so far as manager of @entity0 to match his record at @entity18 , and managing just a single draw when in charge of @entity21			0
@entity0 manager @entity11 has lost 12 of his last 13 games against @entity3 the last time @entity11 beat @entity3 , in 2008 , @entity23 was playing for the @entity25 club in fact , you have to go back to march 2008 , more than eight years ago , to find @entity11 's last win over @entity3 , on a day that his star man @entity23 was lining up for the @entity31 outfit			1
as @entity32 boss @entity11 did manage four wins against @entity3 , while drawing three times and losing the remaining five of his twelve games			0
however , only the last of those wins came away from home , and none of them in the @entity2 , while his career record against @entity3 sees him triumph only 16 per cent of the time			0
city know they need to produce something special to progress - if they do beat @entity48 's team by the required margin , it will not just be a remarkable achievement for the club , but also for their manager			0
