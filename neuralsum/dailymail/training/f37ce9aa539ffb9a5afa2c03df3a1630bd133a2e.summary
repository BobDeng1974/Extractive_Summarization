resplendent in a red and blue sari with her hair twisted into an elaborate plait , @entity0 looks like any other teenage girl at first glance			1
but while she might have similar tastes to other teens , her life in the @entity9 capital , @entity10 , is very different			2
for @entity0 , although just 17 years old , has already been married for two years after being forced to wed a rickshaw driver named @entity14 when he threatened to end his own life if she did n't			1
child : although illegal in @entity9 , @entity0 was married when she was just 15 and now has a daughter , @entity18 ' they said he ’d commit suicide if i did n’t run away with him , ' she explains , as she sits with her eight - month - old daughter , @entity18 , who fidgets in her arms			1
since the wedding , life has been hard with @entity0 forced to swap going to school for days spent doing chores and taking care of her child			1
worse , @entity14 , 21 , has proved to be a less than stellar husband , frequently leaving his wife and child to survive on the pittance he gives them from his wages of 400 taka ( £ 38 ) a month			1
' he spends more than he earns , and usually does n’t give me money , ' explains @entity0 , who has lost weight since her wedding thanks to @entity14 's reluctance to provide adequate funds for food			1
' most of our money goes on food , ' she adds			0
' i really regret getting married so young			0
i had so much freedom before and did n’t have to care about my family and responsibilities			0
' family : @entity0 , pictured with her younger brother and sister , lives in @entity10 with husband @entity14 and baby @entity18 the 20 countries where child weddings are most common and the percentage of girls involved and she 's not the only member of her family to marry young			1
her mother @entity64 was married off at just 13 years old and gave birth to @entity0 as a 16 - year - old			1
' i was so young and i did n’t know my husband , so i was afraid of him , ' says @entity64			0
' i did n’t know what it meant to have a husband			0
' shocking though they are , @entity0 and @entity73 's stories are far from unusual			2
20 per cent of @entity9 girls marry before the age of 15 , while 66 per cent wed before the age of 18 - even though both scenarios are illegal			1
worldwide , one in nine girls are married off before the age of 15 , with those that do running a significantly higher risk of dying in childbirth than women in their 20s			1
' i have some friends who are going to college now and i feel bad that i ca n’t go with them , ' adds @entity0			2
mother and daughter : @entity0 's own mother , @entity64 ( left ) was married off at the age of 13 and had a baby at 16 source : @entity94 1			1
@entity113 source : @entity115 ' i used to really enjoy my school life			0
my teacher used to call me a singing bird because i would always sing and dance			0
' instead of school , @entity0 's day is now dominated by chores and caring for her daughter , as well as trying to keep her husband happy			1
' i get up at 5am for morning prayers , ' she explains			0
' i start cooking and go to fetch water from the tube well nearby			0
' i look after the baby and make food and then think about what food to make for lunch			0
by 7pm i try to finish all of my cooking and household chores and then watch tv and watch soap operas			0
' for @entity0 , like many married girls , watching soap operas is the most exciting part of her day			1
' one show i watch is @entity147 , ' she reveals			0
' it ’s the story of two sisters			0
i aspire to be like @entity147 , she ’s the good one , the responsible wife and daughter - in - law who helps everyone when they are in a bad situation			2
' sadly , for @entity0 and others like her , the chances of escaping her own ' bad situation ' are vanishingly small			2
global problem : @entity106 is the country with the highest number of child brides , this little girl among them with more than 14 million child marriages each year , underage weddings are becoming an increasingly common problem worldwide but are seen more frequently in very religious countries such as @entity9			2
' the causes of child marriage in @entity9 are complex , and vary from context to context , ' explains @entity172 , a gender adviser at children 's charity @entity174			1
' however , the practice is driven by boys being valued over girls and poverty , because poorer families try and marry their daughters off early due to economic pressures within the household and also because a dowry is cheaper if the girl is younger			2
' other factors include using child marriage as a way to control girls ’ sexuality and prevent them marrying outside the arranged marriage system and weak enforcement of laws			0
' currently , 20 per cent of @entity9 girls are married by the age of 15 while another 66 per cent have wed by the age of 18 , even though both are illegal			1
' national laws are not implemented , ' adds @entity172 , ' possibly because of negative views and the influence of religious and traditional leaders			0
