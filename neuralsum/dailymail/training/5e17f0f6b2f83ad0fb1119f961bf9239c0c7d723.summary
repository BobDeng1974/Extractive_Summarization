by @entity0 published : 13:45 est , 15 march 2012 updated : 19:03 est , 15 march 2012 families of @entity3 victims reacted with outrage yesterday after it was revealed @entity6 told @entity7 the disaster was caused by drunken @entity10 fans			1
leaked documents show how senior officers blamed disorderly supporters just days after the 1989 stadium tragedy which left 96 dead			1
at least one @entity10 - based policeman said he was ‘ ashamed ’ of the spectators ’ behaviour			1
former chief constable : sir @entity19 with his wife @entity20 after receiving a @entity21 the briefings contrast with the findings of the official inquiry , which pinned the blame on officers responsible for crowd control at the @entity28 semi-final at @entity31 ’s ground			0
supporters ’ groups have been pushing for all documents surrounding the tragedy to be published , claiming there was an attempt to cover up police failings and discredit fans			1
yesterday it emerged that four days after the disaster , a member of then - prime minister @entity7 ’s policy unit met @entity45 officers for their views on the cause			1
according to the document , leaked to the @entity49 , chief constable sir @entity19 told the adviser : ‘ a key factor in causing the disaster was the fact that large numbers of @entity10 fans had turned up without tickets			1
‘ this was getting lost sight of in attempts to blame the police , the football authorities , etc. ’ another – unnamed – officer was said to have directly blamed the supporters			1
‘ one officer , born and bred in @entity10 , said that he was deeply ashamed to say that it was drunken @entity10 fans who had caused this disaster , just as they had caused the deaths at @entity70 , ’ the note said			1
the document is initialled ‘ mt ’ , suggesting it was read by @entity7 , and the phrase ‘ drunken @entity10 fans ’ is underlined by hand			1
tragedy : ninety - six people died at the @entity3 disaster in 1989 thirty - nine died at the @entity78 in @entity79 in 1985 when @entity10 supporters charged @entity82 fans			1
although the inquest into the @entity3 deaths was told that vast quantities of alcohol had been consumed before kick - off , the official @entity83 blamed the tragedy on blunders by @entity92 officers policing the match			1
it said opening an exit gate just before kick - off enabled hundreds of fans to pour into a full ‘ pen ’ on the terraces , causing the fatal crush			2
the @entity101 , set up in 2009 , is reviewing all official papers relating to the disaster with a view to their release later this year			2
blame : another policeman also said @entity10 fans were responsible for the deaths , according to the document @entity111 , of the @entity112 , said last night : ‘ we are obviously disgusted with the views of @entity6 but to some of us that will come as no surprise			2
’ and @entity118 , whose 18 - year - old son @entity119 died in the stadium , said the note confirmed her fears of an attempted cover - up			0
‘ the thing i ’m most upset about is the way they are accusing the fans , ’ she said			2
‘ they watched videos of what happened that day and they ( have seen ) survivors running along with bodies and maybe people who may be still alive on hoardings			0
they were the heroes that day			0
disapproving : sir @entity19 was concerned about @entity136 being turned into a ' shrine ' , according to the papers ‘ i find all of that absolutely appalling			2
ninety - six lives and he was uneasy about it made into a shrine			0
‘ the people who were there that day - the survivors , the fans - all needed somewhere to go to show respect and to be grateful that no more had died			1
he was ashamed that was made into a shrine			2
how appalling is that ? ’ @entity151 mp @entity150 , who has backed efforts to secure the documents ’ release , said : ‘ these papers seem to confirm what we ’ve believed for many , many years – that immediate attempts were made from the highest levels to shift the blame on to the supporters and away from the police			2
’ @entity7 was told about the views of @entity6 four days after the tragedy a controversial figure , sir @entity19 – who died in 1998 – was frequently at loggerheads with the city ’s @entity151 - dominated police authority			1
last night former assistant chief constable @entity170 , who was in charge of the force ’s initial response to the disaster , said she was shocked by his views			0
‘ there was no suggestion at the time that fans were drunk , ’ she said			0
‘ sir @entity19 never spoke to me about what had happened and i find his comments absolutely appalling			0
’ @entity45 chief constable @entity181 said it would be inappropriate to comment			1
@entity111 of the @entity112 said she was disgusted but not surprised at the views expressed by the police			0
‘ those of us who were around @entity10 in the 1980s are well aware of @entity189 ’s racist and bigoted views , presumably he recruited senior officers with a similar mindset , ’ she told the programme			0
‘ we are obviously disgusted with the views of @entity6 but to some of us that will come as no surprise			0
’ she also expressed concern at the timing of the leak and the fact that none of the papers related to the @entity92 force			0
‘ that makes us very suspicious of how this information was leaked , ’ she said			0
‘ @entity6 would have been informed by @entity205			0
‘ we find it a strange coincidence that this information is leaked only days after we found out the panel are not going to report until the autumn			0

leaked @entity213 papers show @entity7 was told of claims in meeting
unnamed officer ' said he was ashamed of drunken fans '
@entity220 has been met with anger on @entity45
