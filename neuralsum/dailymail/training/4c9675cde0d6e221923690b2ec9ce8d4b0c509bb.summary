by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 16:04 est , 18 may 2013 next time you are out on a busy street , look around you			1
there will , no doubt , be people walking and going about their daily business			2
so far , so ordinary			0
but stop for a moment to really watch			0
hunched over , shoulders tense , arms unmoving , heads often bowed – the simple act of movement seems a struggle for many			1
and that is because they are not walking correctly			1
i admit it sounds ludicrous – starting to walk is a milestone most of us pass shortly after our eighth month of life , usually with the help of our parents			1
but , typically , bar a little self - taught fine - tuning , there ends the lesson			0
getting off on the right foot : sports scientist @entity0 , right , and her client @entity25 , left , go through their paces as adults , a life spent sitting at a desk , struggling around with heavy bags and wearing all kinds of lovely - looking but unforgiving footwear takes its toll on our posture			1
just as we often sit incorrectly , we also walk incorrectly			1
the knock - on effect ? an epidemic of joint pain – in particular bad backs – affecting millions of us			1
about eight in ten of us have one of more bouts of lower - back pain at some time in our lives			1
one @entity45 survey suggested that 15 per of adults are in continuous pain from a bad back			1
with this in mind , i first set about researching efficient and posturally correct ways of practising the everyday activity of walking			1
i studied sport science at @entity55 , so i have a strong research background – and i drew from studies in the world of physiology , biomechanics and fitness disciplines such as @entity62			0
i now teach a simple way to master walking that is , i believe , the most beneficial way of moving			0
i became my own guinea pig after having my first child			0
i did n’t want to do the same level of exercise i undertook previously – i used to jog for miles			0
just from walking , my thighs got leaner , my waist tapered in , my bottom was lifted and i eradicated my saddlebags			0
i can promise it will do for you what it has for hundreds of my private clients : walking daily will help you shed up to 10 lb in less than a month			1
even if you do n’t lose that much straight away , you will look slimmer , dropping more than a dress size			0
@entity25 , 42 , lives in @entity79 with her husband @entity80 , 46 , a photo editor , and their two children , aged six and three			0
she says : ‘ i started walking two years ago			0
i was playing tennis with a friend in @entity86 when i caught sight of a leaflet advertising @entity90 ’s method			1
‘ at the time , my daughter was just a year and a half old and i was desperate to get back some energy			1
‘ i ’ve never needed to lose weight but i wanted to tone up			0
@entity90 was an inspiration – amazingly fit and toned , and she glided rather than waddled along			0
it was great fun – and everything was explained to us on a one - to - one basis			0
‘ after just two weeks i could feel a difference			0
my bottom and upper thighs were much firmer			0
as a freelance projects manager – i work for milliner @entity105 – i need a regime that works with a busy life and children			1
now , i try to walk twice a week with a girlfriend			1
‘ i lost 10lb and have kept it off , but more importantly i stand taller and my body feels honed from top to toe			1
’ you must make one diet tweak : no starchy carbs after 5pm			0
there ’s no need to go to a gym , use expensive equipment or even to get sweaty			1
this is n't power - walking , which involves all kinds of strange hip wiggling			2
read this guide for everything you need to master the technique : your new walking style will look fast , smooth and fluid – and you ’ll feel dynamic and buzz with energy			2
@entity134 does it work ? the principle of my method is simple			0
it is based on correctly aligning the fascia – the connective tissue in the body , which starts just below the skin			1
in the 1990s , anatomists discovered that the fascia encases , separates and envelops every part of our physiology – muscles , organs and blood vessels			2
it ’s like a net that holds us together			2
the theory is currently supported by many chiropractors , podiatrists and sports scientists			2
so by holding the body correctly as you exercise , you are effectively shrink - wrapping the muscles within the fascia and working the body from the inside out			1
by aligning the body properly , posture is corrected and movement becomes fluid while discomfort – such as back pain – lessens			1
the body benefits from correct postural alignment in three ways : why walk ? the @entity169 scheme @entity170 recommends that ideally we all walk 10,000 steps a day ( about five miles ) , which burns up to 450 calories			1
but on average we walk only about 4,000 steps a day			2
it takes about ten minutes to walk 1,500 steps			2
professor @entity177 , an @entity178 academic specialising in physical activity , suggests that walking fewer than 5,000 steps a day indicates a sedentary lifestyle			0
a 2010 @entity183 report about sedentary behaviour showed that it is associated with higher mortality overall , heart disease , diabetes and some cancers			0
walk to @entity189 aside from improvements in posture , higher calorie expenditure and protection for the joints , there are a host of other health benefits to be gained from walking			1
@entity198 ten thousand cases of breast and bowel cancer could be prevented each year if more of us took a brisk walk every day			2
just 45 minutes of daily activity at a moderate level could prevent about 5,500 cases of breast cancer a year in the @entity208			0
diabetes the @entity210 ( @entity210 ) in the @entity178 produced a fact sheet called the relationship of walking to mortality among @entity178 @entity214 , which states that those with diabetes who walked for two or more hours a week lowered their mortality rate from all causes by 39 per cent			0
high cholesterol a study was published suggesting that low - intensity exercise such as walking improves insulin sensitivity and blood lipid levels better than an hour - long high - intensity workout			2
@entity226 charity mind advocates walking to relieve stress , improve sleep quality and fight depression , since physical activity causes the brain to release endorphins – chemicals that improve mood			2
dementia researchers from the @entity238 who studied people in their early 60s found that those with a slower walking pace were one - and - a - half times more likely to develop dementia .			0

sports scientist @entity0 teaches a way to walk that aligns the body
the technique can help alleviate back pain and help shed the *excess* pounds
*cosmetically* : by *targeting* the fascia , body shape is *streamlined* .
*functionally* : back , knee , hip and neck discomfort are alleviated as joints are correctly aligned .
posturally : as movement quality increases , you look more agile , stand taller and look younger .
