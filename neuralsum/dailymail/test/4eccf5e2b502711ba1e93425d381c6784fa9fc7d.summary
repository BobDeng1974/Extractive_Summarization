chances are you 've been to @entity2			1
well , the airport at any rate			2
every year , millions of us pass through on the way to the beaches of the @entity8 or palaces of @entity10			2
but , now , the southern @entity12 port is having a moment			1
thanks to a multi-million pound regeneration project , and several new galleries and museums , this once down - at - heel city has become one of @entity20 's hippest destinations			1
incoming : the @entity2 , a pop - up version of the @entity23 institution , has opened to visitors along with a thriving cultural scene , there are good restaurants , great shopping and exciting nightlife			1
this week saw the opening of @entity31 , the first of several popup versions of the famous @entity23 gallery planned outside @entity35			1
it is housed in a low - slung white building topped with a giant glass cube in the trendy harbour area			1
when i turn up , a large crowd is queuing to pay the £ 6.70 entrance fee to view 90 works by artists such as @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 on loan from the @entity49 in @entity35 , plus an exhibition exploring dance and choreography			2
there 's a brilliant room of self - portraits , including a @entity56 and @entity57			1
drawing a big huddle is @entity60 's striking installation , ghost — a mass of @entity64 women in prayer , made from tin foil			2
@entity67 is the latest bold step in branding @entity2 a ' @entity69 '			2
across town , the first overseas branch of @entity71 has just opened in a refurbished tobacco factory			1
take a good look : @entity75 offers fine views of the city , with the @entity78 as a wide backdrop next door is the @entity81 , an extraordinary celebration of cars , fashion and art. by 2016 , a @entity86 and @entity87 will complete the set			1
@entity2 's @entity89 opened in 2003 — a long - held dream of the artist , who was born in the city in 1881			1
the @entity81 in @entity2 houses around 90 classic cars , plus displays of haute couture round the corner , you can peek into @entity100 church where he was baptised			2
the @entity102 in the house where he lived until he was ten , contains more paintings , ceramics , early photos , belongings and sketchbooks			0
what sets @entity2 apart — for now , at least — is that all these galleries tend to be uncrowded , refreshingly small , and most in walking distance of each other			0
that means there 's plenty of time to explore @entity119 cuisine			0
get in the mood at the buzzing @entity122 market , then try the terrace at @entity124 , which overlooks the @entity126 amphitheatre			0
for unbeatable seafood , take the bus to the beach at @entity130 on the city 's outskirts , where locals feast on freshly caught boquerones ( anchovies , often deep fried ) , espetos ( sardines , barbecued on sticks ) and platters of enormous mussels , prawns and clams			0
for modern minimalism , head to the sleek gastrobars of the arty @entity147 district , such as @entity148 , where punky young things queue for tables			0
' @entity153 just stays the same , ' one girl tells me over fusion tapas and a beer			0
' @entity2 is moving on			0
' green and pleasant : @entity2 's botanical garden plays host to exotic plants from around the world near the @entity49 is the city 's botanic gardens , rated as one of the best in @entity20 and bursting with palms , exotic plants and squawking birds			0
also to see are the @entity170 fortress and @entity75 castle , where you can enjoy fabulous panoramic views of the city			0
visitor numbers are already soaring — with some people saying @entity2 will be like @entity177 in ten years ' time			1
i 'm tempted to agree with them			0
