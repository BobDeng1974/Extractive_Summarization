' bruising into tissue wounds suggest that @entity2 was still alive as the defendant started to remove her head , ' the lawyer said			1
' the process of decapitation would require considerable motion with corresponding considerable force which needed to be sustained until all the tissues had been cut through			0
' force would also be needed to restrain the victim who is likely to have been struggling			0
severe force would have been needed to cut through the spinal vertebrae with a knife in order to remove the head			0
' mr @entity38 told the jury that @entity3 was seen naked outside his flat in @entity13 with blood pouring out of his chest , and told emergency workers : ' i do n't know why i did it			1
' she like me but i raped her			0
what i did was wrong			0
i need punishing for it			0
' he also allegedly asked the paramedics : ' why are you helping me ? i 've murdered someone			2
' the lawyer said @entity3 was likely to claim he was suffering from diminished responsibility due to schizophrenia at the time of the attack			1

@entity3 was calm when he was first arrested , but after he was taken to the nearby @entity113 for treatment he attacked staff trying to help him , mr @entity38 said			2
he allegedly assaulted a cardiothoracic surgeon and an anaesthetist as well as police officers who tried to restrain him , biting one of them , before he was injected with a sedative			0
mr @entity38 said the prosecution rejected @entity3 's likely defence of diminished responsibility			2
he said he had ' no history of mental illness ' , adding : ' he was able to function perfectly well - he held down a job , he lived on his own , he had his own flat and , it 's a self - evident truth , he had a girlfriend			2
' the lawyer continued : ' the prosecution case is that his behaviour right up until the time of the killing was entirely ordinary			0
of course the killing itself was anything but ordinary			0
' the prosecution say that his behaviour at the time of the killing is much more likely to be explained by the fact he had a propensity towards violence and his controlling behaviour towards @entity2			2
