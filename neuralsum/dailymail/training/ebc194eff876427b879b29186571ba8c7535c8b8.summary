' the safety of the public is paramount at all times of course but it was nice to have the opportunity to enjoy with the fans , especially those from overseas			0
' i just hope that the @entity23 fans in particular will see that @entity60 officers are positive and professional but there 's a human side to all of us too			1
' @entity29 , who gave up rugby as a schoolboy ' due to a massive lack of talent ' , said he knew the moves from watching @entity23 ' matches on television			2
' [ @entity23 are ] the best team in the world so i 've watched them do the @entity3 on the tv so many times			2
i like to think they 'll be pretty impressed with my moves			0
