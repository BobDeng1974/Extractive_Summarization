by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 24 february 2013 the stop the @entity1 will warn about the threat that robots pose to humanity , like in the 1984 @entity6 science fiction action film @entity7 directed by @entity8 a group of academics , pressure groups and @entity14 peace prize laureates is to launch an international campaign to ban ' terminators ' before they reach the production stage , it was reported today			1
the @entity19 campaign will call for a global treaty on robot warfare and autonomous weapons , the next step from unmanned drones , before they become a ' threat '			1
dr @entity27 , a leading robotics and artificial intelligence expert and professor at @entity31 , said weapons like these are already being worked on by scientists and will be available within the decade			1
he believes that development of the weapons is taking place in an effectively unregulated environment , with little attention being paid to moral implications and international law			1
the campaign will be launched in april at the @entity44 and includes many of the groups that successfully campaigned to have international action taken against cluster bombs and landmines , @entity42 reported			1
professor @entity27 told the paper : ' these things are not science fiction ; they are well into development			2
' the research wing of the @entity54 in the @entity6 is working on the @entity55 [ unmanned plane ] which has supersonic twists and turns with a g - force that no human being could manage , a craft which would take autonomous armed combat anywhere in the planet			2
' in @entity6 they are already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots , looking for young men who are very good at computer games			2
they are looking at swarms of robots , with perhaps one person watching what they do			2
' @entity27 insists he is not anti-war but deeply concerned about how quickly science is moving ahead of the presumptions underlying the @entity78 convention and the international laws of war			0
he disputes the justification that deploying robot soldiers would potentially save lives of real soldiers and says at present there is no mechanism in a robot 's ' mind ' to distinguish between a child holding up a sweet and an adult pointing a gun			1
in november it was reported that a centre for ' terminator studies ' , where leading academics will study the threat that robots pose to humanity , is set to open at @entity99			0
@entity31 's professor @entity27 , a world leading robotics expert and former judge on tv 's @entity103 , is backing the campaign the @entity19 campaign will call for a global treaty on robot warfare and autonomous weapons , the next step from unmanned drones ( pictured ) the campaign will be launched by @entity113 , the astronomer royal , at the @entity44 in april its purpose will be to study the four greatest threats to the human species - artificial intelligence , climate change , nuclear war and rogue biotechnology			1
the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) will be co-launched by @entity113 , the astronomer royal and one of the world 's top cosmologists			0
@entity113 's 2003 book @entity125 had warned that the destructiveness of humanity meant that the species could wipe itself out by 2100			0
the idea that machines might one day take over humanity has featured in many science fiction books and films , including the @entity7 , in which @entity136 stars as a homicidal robot			1
in 1965 , @entity138 and wrote a paper for @entity140 called speculations concerning the first ultra-intelligent machine			0
good , a @entity99 - trained mathematician , @entity144 cryptographer , pioneering computer scientist and friend of @entity146 , wrote that in the near future an ultra-intelligent machine would be built			0
this machine , he continued , would be the ' last invention ' that mankind will ever make , leading to an ' intelligence explosion			0
for @entity152 , who went on to advise @entity153 on @entity154 , the ' survival of man ' depended on the construction of this ultra-intelligent machine .			0

stop the @entity1 campaign will call for global treaty on robot warfare
it includes groups that successfully fought against the use of landmines
