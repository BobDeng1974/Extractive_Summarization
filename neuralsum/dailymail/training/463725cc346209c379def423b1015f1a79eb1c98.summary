commuters would be given a tax break worth hundreds of pounds to cut the cost of season tickets under plans unveiled by @entity5			1
the @entity7 mayor is urging the government to allow rail , bus and tube passengers to buy passes from pre-tax income , reducing the cost of getting to work			1
he called on chancellor @entity16 to back the idea , which would benefit commuters without helping foreign tourists or daytrippers			0
plea : @entity7 mayor @entity5 is urging the @entity21 to offer tax breaks for commuters to buy season tickets to cut the cost of getting to work ministers are expected to announce extra help to curb rises in rail fares this week , ahead of inflation - busting increases coming into force from january 1			1
some season tickets have risen by more than 80 per cent in the last decade , costing passengers thousands of pounds			2
last month mr @entity16 borrowed from supermarket slogans to declare ‘ every penny counts ’ as he signalled action to reduce energy and water bills , cut rents and limit rises in motoring costs and rail fares			1
but mr @entity5 today warned against using the ‘ hopelessly blunt instrument ’ of limiting annual increases in ticket prices			0
he revealed he is in talks with the chancellor over offering a tax break on commuters ' bus and train fares			1
mr @entity5 said : ' employees should be allowed to pay for their season tickets from their pre-tax income			2
' the idea , similar to the current system of childcare vouchers used by many working families , would see the cost of a season ticket deducted from pay packets before tax and national insurance is taken out			1
a commuter buying a £ 784 annual bus pass would save £ 251 in tax and @entity66 , and their employer would save £ 108			0
travel : chancellor @entity16 last week announced plans to freeze fuel duty for motorists but is planning to do more for rail passengers in the coming weeks mr @entity5 believes there is a ‘ compelling case ’ for the plan to be applied across the country			1
mr @entity5 said it would be ‘ irresponsible ’ not to raise fare income sufficiently to pay for the modernisation of @entity7 's ageing underground network and cope with a fast - rising population			2
but a tax relief would target workers ' travel costs while a ‘ hopelessly blunt ’ fare freeze would benefit tourists and casual passengers who did not ‘ need or deserve ’ help			2
mr @entity5 : ‘ yes , there would be a cost to the @entity21 - but then every year government spends huge sums trying to hold fares down			1
‘ this scheme strikes me as one @entity16 should consider further			0
you would allow continued investment in transport , and you would target your help at exactly the people who need it - not the millionaires and the tourists and the casual shoppers , but the hardworking people who are really turning the wheels of recovery , ’ he wrote in the @entity106			0
mr @entity5 said 40 per cent of passengers travelled for nothing - and that there would be mayhem if any attempt was made to strip the ‘ affluent bourgeoisie ’ of old - age bus passes			0
‘ the result is that the entire burden of fare - paying is carried by the 60 % - and that includes the people who make this country work , the people on low or moderate incomes who travel large distances every day and who to their places of employment and who have absolutely no choice in the matter			0
‘ it is time we did something specifically to help them , and that something is to give tax relief on travel			0
’ ‘ employees should be allowed to pay for their season tickets from their pre-tax income			2
’ the @entity140 will seek to recast themselves as the friend of cash strapped voters this week when transport secretary @entity144 announces plans on wednesday to help hard - pressed train commuters			2
his department has already announced plans to ensure that ticket pricing is fairer , with a single costing half of a double ticket and plans for new flexible season tickets for part - time workers			1
mr @entity5 added : ‘ if you have to use public transport morning and night , then you know that it can take a huge slice of your income			0
‘ every autumn we face the same dilemma			0
if we follow the pleas of our officials , and raise fares - to cope with inflation and the cost of investing in our systems - then we are tightening the squeeze on people who have already seen their disposable income shrink over the last five years			1
‘ if we are irresponsible , on the other hand , and we fail to replenish the ' fare box ' , then we risk disaster			0
