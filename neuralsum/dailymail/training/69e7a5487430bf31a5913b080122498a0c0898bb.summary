by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 07:58 est , 30 march 2012 the nearly two - mile - long runway at @entity3 in southern @entity4 will have to be extended to accommodate @entity6 's sleek rocket - powered spacecraft , spaceport officials confirmed today			2
@entity8 board members voted to extend the runway by another 2,000 feet			2
@entity3 is the world 's first terminal , hangar and runway built specifically for commercial space travel			1
@entity6 , which will be the spaceport 's anchor tenant , determined through a battery of test flights and simulations that more room would be needed for landings under certain circumstances			1
new era : @entity6 's @entity25 mothership on the runway at @entity3 ‘ it 's really being done for safety , ’ spaceport spokesman @entity27 said			2
‘ it was a guess until they started dropping it and simulating and doing different scenarios , how this thing was going to behave on the runway			0
this is all a product of the testing and the characteristics of the vehicle			0
’ backed by @entity41 billionaire @entity40 , the commercial space line has been developing its craft and rocket engines in @entity45 's @entity44			1
the company plans to begin moving into the hangar and terminal facility later this year , and the runway extension is not expected to cause delays			1
the runway was dedicated by @entity40 and other officials in october 2010 with much fanfare			0
stretching across a flat dusty plain 45 miles north of @entity58 , the runway is designed to support almost every aircraft in the world , day - to - day space tourism flights and payload launch operations			1
it is 42 inches thick and includes a 14 - inch layer of concrete			0
blue - sky thinking : whiteknighttwo on display outside the hangar facility at the spaceport the extension will cost $ 7 million ( £ 4million ) , @entity27 said			1
money will be reassigned within the spaceport 's $ 209million taxpayer - financed budget to absorb the cost of the change			1
designing the extension will take six to eight months			0
@entity6 has said rocket testing is continuing and commercial flights are at least a year away			1
@entity27 said the extension did not come as a surprise to spaceport board members			0
as part of the agreement @entity6 had with @entity4 to build the spaceport , any technical changes that resulted from development of the spaceship technology would have to be accommodated by the state			0
hitching a ride : @entity25 acts as a carrier for @entity89 , where the passengers will sit one scenario considered was if the rocket ship 's engines did not fire			0
that would require the craft to glide back to the spaceport , loaded with unburned fuel			2
that would mean the craft would be heavier and would require more room to land			2
other factors involve @entity4 's altitude and high temperatures , which make the air thinner			0
‘ that dictates longer runways , ’ @entity27 said			0
@entity107 and @entity6 officials have said repeatedly that everything possible will be done to ensure safety once commercial flights begin			1
unlike experimental programs run by @entity112 , @entity27 said @entity3 and @entity6 are based on business models and investments			0
‘ obviously safety has to be at the highest level , especially when you 're talking about commercial passenger service , ’ he said			2
@entity40 announced last week that @entity6 had netted its 500th customer , actor @entity119			1
others include @entity122 types , international entrepreneurs , scientists and space buffs			0
at $ 200,000 ( £ 125,000 ) a ticket , the space tourists get a two - and - a - half - hour flight with about five minutes of weightlessness and views of @entity131 that until now only astronauts have been able to experience .			1

tickets on craft cost £ 125,000 with stars such as @entity119 already signed up
commercial flights will begin next year
