at first glance , it would be easy to see @entity2 : @entity3 as ' just ' another yearly update of the long - running and oft controversial series			1
indeed , developers @entity6 could have played it safe , delivering predictable thrills , gameplay and multiplayer that still would have guaranteed sales in the millions			1
@entity13 : @entity14 is one of the game 's main characters			0
what is immediately noticeable are the improvements in the @entity20 's animation and facial expressions			1
this is backed up with some brilliant voice acting			1
but interestingly , this is not the case			0
and while aesthetically the game is similar to the others , @entity6 have tried to bring something new to series - and have largely succeeded			1
you play ( for the most part ) @entity32 , son of @entity33 - the main character in the original			1
the year 's 2025 and you 're sent on a mission to take down a terrorist called @entity38 - a psychotic , megalomaniac who you empathise with one minute , and detest the next			1
although a slightly routine plot , it 's how @entity43 tells the tale that makes it stand out			0
there 's an element of choice never before seen in the series			0
whether you kill someone or succeed in a mission may come back to haunt you later on			0
this is particularly evident in the @entity53 missions			0
the outcome directly impacts the game 's narrative - the often terrible consequences serving as an emotive reminder of your actions			1
the futuristic setting also lends itself to drone warfare , which adds another element to predominately run - and - gun gameplay			1
although some missions force you to use robotic warriors , certain sections ( for example , guiding the enormous claw ) give you much more tactical freedom			0
you can use it for cover , or to draw fire while you flank enemies			0
although behind the smoke and mirrors level design is still rather linear , the element of consequence makes the story feel less like a bunch of loosely connected set pieces and more of a virtual @entity85 - style blockbuster			1
this is helped by enhancements in the graphics			0
although using the same engine as the original , lighting has been improved , and draw distances seem more impressive - adequately dealing with the more ambitious scale			1
taking the plunge : as expected , there are plenty of set pieces on show in @entity3			0
one level in the desert on horseback , in particular , acts as showcase in just how far the aging graphics engine has come			0
but it is the facial animations and character models that steal the show			0
all the characters boast perfect lip synching and wonderfully - emotive expressions			1
it 's mesmeric watching @entity14 , @entity32 's battle - hardened teammate - suddenly be hit by panic and fear - his eyes widening and body tensing up			2
then seeing his cheekiness and swagger when chatting up a woman later in the game			0
these are real people - which makes the often graphic deaths that much more shocking when you witness them			2
it 's helped along by some brilliant voice acting			1
although purists may notice @entity125 no longer voices @entity126 , @entity127 ( better known as the @entity128 ) lends his likeness and voice to commander @entity131 , playing the role with menace and conviction			1
but for many , @entity2 's campaign plays second fiddle to its multiplayer , and thankfully , @entity6 have delivered - particularly with their @entity139 system			1
this gives you ten points to modify weapons and items of your choice			0
this allows you to create specifically tuned loadouts that are tailored to your playing style			0
run and gun : most of the game is first person , but there are well - rendered cut - scenes which help break up the action , while also reinforcing the narrative			2
further welcome modifications such as the revised @entity157 replacing the @entity158 mean that it 's now much easier to rack up high scores			2
changes to @entity162 means that there are no stat resets when you reach a certain level - so you keep your weapon experience and challenge progress			2
the usual multiplayer modes make a welcome return ( albeit with a few tweaks ) , while @entity172 ( against bots ) provides to perfect place to hone your skills and rise up the xp ranks			2
then there is @entity178 , which is the deepest one yet			0
it 's incredibly fun taking on waves of the undead , made even more so by a number of gameplay tweaks			2
there are lots of items that can be found and turned into defensive weapons , while the @entity190 world gives you much more freedom and scale to make your last stand as fun as possible			0
there 's no denying that some critics will write this off as yet another @entity2 ' mod '			1
but do so at your peril , because @entity6 have done to @entity2 , what @entity201 did for @entity203			1
defied the norm , evolved the series and kick - started a lagging franchise			2
follow @entity207 on @entity208 : @ @entity209 and on @entity210 : @entity211 .			0

best - looking @entity2 ever made , with a fantastic story
brilliant animation and voice acting
multiplayer has been revised and is now better than ever
*zombies* no longer feels like an ' add - on '
