health visitors are to be given guidance on how to recognise the signs of relationships in trouble and offer support to help families stay together			1
work and pensions secretary @entity7 believes couples may be reluctant to seek support but are more likely to respond to professionals they already know			1
the proposal emerged as mr @entity7 claimed @entity14 ’s broken society is slowly on the mend , with a quarter of a million more children living with both parents than when the government came to power			1
health visitors are to be given guidance on how to recognise the signs of relationships in trouble and offer support to help families stay together ( file picture ) the minister , who oversees all government policy on social justice , said there were other ‘ signs of hope ’ , including 160,000 people having taken up an offer of support to keep troubled families together			1
of the proposal to encourage health visitors to intervene if they encounter couples whose relationships are in trouble , a government source added : ‘ health visitors often have to deal with relationship issues in their regular contact with families , and as such , are well placed to identify signs of relationship distress and signpost to appropriate support			1
‘ we will therefore develop national guidance for health visitors on how to recognise the signs of relationship difficulties , how to respond and review the need for further support			2
’ the @entity58 has already offered training to health visitors on specific issues such as mothers ’ mental health around the time of birth and domestic violence			0
‘ a similar approach will be adopted for wider relationship distress , ’ the source added			2
in a major speech in @entity71 , mr @entity7 yesterday said he believed a social ‘ revolution is underway ’ in some of @entity14 ’s ‘ poorest neighbourhoods ’			1
there are record numbers of people in work , up two million since 2010 , 33,000 pupils on free school meals are now getting good grades in @entity81 and @entity82 and members of 53,000 troubled families are back to school or into work , he said			1
official figures also suggest 2,100 former gang members are ‘ back on the straight and narrow ’			2
the latest figures show economic inactivity is at a historic low , and more than 800,000 fewer people are on the main out - of - work benefits			2
there has also been the largest ever annual fall both in youth unemployment and workless households			0
‘ each and every one of these statistics is a rise in hope			0
each and every one , a life transformed , ’ mr @entity7 said			1
work and pensions secretary @entity7 ( pictured ) believes couples are more likely to respond to professionals they already know he claimed that the @entity18 had been ‘ unwavering in its commitment to social reform ’ , saying changes to welfare , education , justice and health were all designed ‘ so that they no longer trap people , but set them on a path from dependency to independence ’			1
‘ social justice is about offering meaningful routes out of disadvantage , and dispelling the appalling idea that it is easier to manage the problem than to help transform people ’s lives			1
‘ for you do n’t solve addiction by parking people on methadone			0
you do n’t stop problem debt by abandoning people to payday lenders			0
‘ you do n’t rehabilitate offenders by simply locking them away , and you do n't cure welfare dependency by parking people on benefits			0
’ previous governments had thrown ‘ more and more taxpayers ’ money on ineffective remedial policies , in the hope of doing something ’ about the country ’s social ills , he said			1
the coalition had pioneered a new approached , investing in programmes based on results and which involved ‘ intervening early ’ and ‘ offering second chances out where lives do go off track ’			0
‘ it has not been easy , for cultural change is never quick			0
yet i believe we are now seeing real progress , ’ mr @entity7 said			1
‘ it starts with prevention : getting to the source of social problems early , rather than waiting to pick up the pieces			0
’ he pointed to schemes in health , where new family nurse partnerships are now helping vulnerable mothers in over 100 councils , and the record number of parents – more than a million – now using children ’s centres			0
some 260,000 disadvantaged two - year - olds are now benefitting from free early education , he added			0
despite the progress , he warned that the ‘ disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been ’			1
‘ we have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom			2
‘ yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life			0
‘ i believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well			0
’ mr @entity7 urged the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘ social enterprises ’ in deprived neighbourhoods			1
‘ because they are risking their money – money that could otherwise be reaping a return elsewhere – those investors will want to see that social programme succeed , bringing a whole new rigour to how it is delivered , ’ he said			2
‘ but what ’s more , the same investors will want to take an interest in that community where they would otherwise be totally detached … brought back into contact with our most disadvantaged individuals and families , for mutual benefit			2
‘ in doing so , these wealth creators could have a powerful influence on the communities themselves , a human interface between two polarised worlds bringing success to the doorstep of failure – the city and the inner city closer together			0
