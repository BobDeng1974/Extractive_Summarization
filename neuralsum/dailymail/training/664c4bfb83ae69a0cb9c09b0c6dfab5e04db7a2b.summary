an @entity1 golfer says giving up @entity2 has ruined his athletic performance			1
@entity4 has fallen down the golf league tables in recent years , and has blamed his slump in form on the fact he gave up drinking litres of @entity2 a day			1
the @entity10 was ranked no 105 in the world rankings in october 2010 but is now sitting at a lowly position of no 726			1
and mr @entity4 claims this was because he went from drinking litres of fizzy drinks to just a few cans			1
@entity4 says quitting an ' addiction ' to @entity2 has affected his athletic performance			1
he claims he has seena slump in form ever since he stopped drinking litres of @entity2 a day			1
he is pictured in action during the third round of the @entity23 last week a 330ml can of @entity2 contains 35g of sugar , the equivalent of almost nine teaspoons			1
it also contains 32mg of caffeine , a third of the amount in a mug of instant coffee mr @entity4 , 40 , told @entity1 radio station @entity32 : ' i cut it out completely and went from such a high on sugar to a dramatic low			1
' i lost all confidence in myself			0
i would n't say i went through a breakdown but i definitely got exceptionally emotional			0
' it was very difficult to deal with all of the situations coming at me			0
' whether that had anything to do with my mental state in any shape or form , i have no idea			0
' i drink two or three cans a day [ now ] but i was drinking litres of the stuff			1
' even in the hottest country , like @entity50 , i 'd have a @entity2 on the golf course because i was addicted to it			2
' @entity2 contains 53g of sugar per 500m bottle			1
this means if that if mr @entity4 was drinking two litres a day , he would be consuming 212g of sugar a day			1
@entity4 said he was drinking several litres of @entity2 a day			1
one litre of @entity2 contains : 106 g sugar : the equivalent of 26 and a half teaspoons 420 calories : 17 per cent of an average man 's daily recommended calorie intake and 21 per cent of a woman 's			1
106 mg caffeine , the equivalent to a mug of instant coffee			0
@entity70 , chair of @entity71 , said mr @entity4 would have been consuming high levels of sugar and caffeine if he was drinking litres of @entity2 a day			1
she told @entity77 : ‘ @entity2 has caffeine in it which is performance enhancing			1
it ’s a stimulant , it makes you more alert			0
' it can enhances fatty acid tissue , so it aids recovery too			0
’ ‘ if you have caffeine withdrawals that can affect you mood , concentration and athletic performance			0
’ ‘ cutting all that sugar out could certainly have caused a dip in mr @entity4 's mood			1
' she added : ‘ normal people who drink fizzy drinks would be overweight			1
he ’s burning off the calories because he ’s very active			0
‘ in some people drinking that much sugar , there will be concerns about diabetes and insulin resistance			2
’ another problem with consuming large volumes of fizzy drinks is they cause tooth decay , she said			1
she added : ‘ anecdotally , clients who drink a lot of @entity2 complain of heartburn			2
' it ’s very acidic			0
i buy it to clean my jewellery			0
if it ’s able to strip dirt off gold , imagine what it ’s doing to your insides			0
’ that ’s the equivalent of 53 teaspoons of sugar			0
it ’s also more than double the recommended amount of sugar ( 50g ) that an adult should eat in a day , according to current guidelines from the @entity126			2
@entity127 should account for no more than 10 per cent of the calories in the diet , or around 12.5 teaspoons			0
however there are plans in the pipeline to halve this recommended daily amount to just 25g , or around six teaspoons			0
@entity70 , chair of @entity71 who has worked with several professional golfers – and other athletes – agreed that mr @entity4 would have been consuming high levels of sugar and caffeine if he was drinking litres of @entity2 a day			1
stopping suddenly could have plausibly caused a dip in his mood and performance if he was n’t replacing the carbohydrates he had been previously been drinking , she said			2
she told @entity77 : ‘ cutting all that sugar out , could certainly have caused a dip in his mood			0
‘ he did n’t specify whether he was eating food as well , so it may have been he was getting all his carbohydrates from @entity2			2
' i would far rather athletes get their carbs - which play a role in mood regulation - in the form of potatoes and wholegrain pasta , for example			0
‘ normal people who drink fizzy drinks would be overweight			1
he ’s burning off the calories because he ’s very active			0
‘ in some people drinking that much sugar , there will be concerns about diabetes and insulin resistance , too			2
' drinking such large volumes of @entity2 would also have meant he was consuming high levels of caffeine - and stopping this suddenly could cause a a dip in mood and performance			1
one litre of @entity2 contains 106mg of caffeine , the equivalent to a mug of instant coffee			2
experts recommend drinking no more than 400mg of caffeine a day			2
ms @entity183 said : ‘ @entity2 has caffeine in it which is performance enhancing			2
it ’s a stimulant , it makes you more alert			0
‘ however if you have caffeine withdrawal , that can affect you mood , concentration and athletic performance			2
’ @entity193 was on the @entity195 ’s list of banned substances until 2004			0
mr @entity4 says after quitting drinking two litres of @entity2 a day he lost confidence in himself			1
he said : ' i would n't say i went through a breakdown but i definitely got exceptionally emotional			0
it was very difficult to deal with all of the situations coming at me ' ms @entity183 added : ‘ ten years ago we were advising people not to drink it , as 350mg a day pushed you over the limit			0
' another problem with consuming large volumes of fizzy drinks is they cause tooth decay , she said			1
‘ we are beginning to see athletes with tooth problems due to fizzy drinks and sports drinks			1
' the diet versions also erode the enamel			0
i ’m always conscious of talking to athletes about their teeth			0
’ the evidence on whether sugar or caffeine is addictive or not is unclear , she said , however some athletes develop a psychological dependence			2
she said : ‘ it could be a psychological habit or addiction			2
lots of athletes do very strange things and feel upset if they do n’t do them			0
so it could be something like that			0
‘ i would n’t like to link mr @entity4 ’s performance with his @entity2 “ addiction ” because in my view it sends out a message to younger athletes who we ’re trying to tell not to drink these drinks			1

@entity4 says his slump in form was due to an addiction to fizzy drinks
he was previously drinking ' litres ' of @entity2 a day but quit the habit
the @entity10 has fallen from @entity250 to no 726 in the world rankings
@entity253 says this could be withdrawal *symptoms* from sugar and caffeine
