@entity1 's @entity0 briefed the @entity2 about a reluctance among internet firms to cooperate with tracking terrorists @entity6 has been warned by the country ’s top spy chiefs that internet companies including @entity10 and @entity11 are undermining national security			1
the prime minister was told internet giants have ‘ withdrawn ’ their cooperation and are obstructing @entity1 requests for help tracking terrorists and major criminals , including paedophiles			1
it follows fugitive @entity22 ’s claims that the firms are used to snoop on @entity25 citizens , which is disputed by spy chiefs			1
before the @entity31 whistleblower ’s disclosures , they willingly responded to lawful requests for details of phone calls , emails , text messages and other private information			1
now the companies are said to be concerned about being seen to acquiesce too easily			0
one of the fears is that intelligence officers will lose the ability to monitor the safety threat posed by @entity25 jihadists travelling to @entity46 , for example @entity39 , 23 , who is said to have died while fighting for militants with links to @entity49			0
a security source told @entity51 : ‘ one of the impacts of the @entity22 disclosures is that internet companies have withdrawn their willing co-operation and that has affected some operations			1
’ the source added that a key bone of contention was the internet service providers ’ unwillingness to hand over encryption keys that unlock data being sought by law enforcement agencies			1
the source added : ‘ it is not simply about terrorism ; it ’s about serious crime , including paedophiles and gangland crime bosses			0
’ now mr @entity6 has been briefed by sir @entity73 , head of the government ’s intelligence gathering operation @entity77 , and @entity0 , director general of @entity1			1
according to a report , more than 500,000 @entity78 ( @entity78 ) requests for data were made to communication service companies last year			1
@entity10 rejects a third of requests made by @entity25 law enforcement authorities and other agencies , while @entity86 turns down a quarter			1
and despite pressure from home secretary @entity88 , @entity86 is moving its entire operation to @entity90 , beyond the scrutiny of @entity25 surveillance laws			0
if others follow , it is feared the country will be left even more dangerously exposed			0
jihadists in @entity46 including @entity39 from west @entity96 ministers have already been told that the thousands of top - secret files stolen by @entity22 and published in the @entity99 , have caused massive damage to @entity25 ’s intelligence capability			1
the source said that it is vital that internet companies help police and security services to stay one step ahead of their targets in a rapidly changing digital world			1
under existing arrangements , police and intelligence agencies use @entity78 to request crucial data and wiretaps			0
but requests are being rejected or sent back for further consideration , even in the case of home secretary - approved warrants			2
access to data has proved essential in thwarting terrorist atrocities and organised crime			0
in 2007 police and @entity1 foiled an @entity49 plot to kidnap , torture and behead a @entity25 @entity128 soldier			1
telephone taps and internet surveillance played a crucial role in jailing five men			2
and in 2012 paedophile @entity133 , 47 , who shared online footage of his rape of a child , was jailed after police intercepted an internet offer he made to abuse a child over a webcam			2
mp @entity141 said : ‘ it ’s right that internet companies take great care in how they handle their users ’ personal information and who has access to it @entity133 , 47 , who shared online footage of his rape on a child , was jailed after police intercepted an internet offer he made over a webcam ‘ but people will clearly expect them to co-operate with the police and others when it comes to tackling matters like serious crime or the dreadful scourge of online paedophilia			2
‘ and they will be rightly concerned if the police and intelligence agencies are facing unnecessary difficulties and delays			0
’ in its most recent government requests report @entity10 stated : ‘ we respond to valid requests relating to criminal cases			2
each and every request we receive is checked for legal sufficiency and we reject or require greater specificity on requests that are overly broad or vague			2
’ @entity86 said : ‘ we carefully review @entity175 for legal sufficiency and interpret them narrowly in an effort to produce the least amount of data necessary to comply with the request			0
’ @entity11 declined to comment directly on the claims but it is understood to follow a policy of fully scrutinising every incoming request			0
the @entity183 said its members were ‘ understandably cautious ’ about handing over data but that none of the companies wanted to break the law			0
a @entity190 spokesman said : ‘ the government is committed to ensuring that law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers they need to investigate crime , protect the public and safeguard national security			0
