hundreds of thousands of @entity0 with holiday homes in @entity2 and @entity3 could be prevented from renting them out to tourists			2
controversial laws set to be passed could also add hundreds of pounds to the cost of breaks for millions of travellers from @entity0			1
they will no longer be able to pay cheaper rates direct to owners but will have to stay in apartments , villas or hotels operated by major firms			1
meanwhile , thousands of second - home owners could end up trying to sell up as the changes make it too complicated and costly to keep the property going			1
concerns : @entity0 villa owners @entity23 and @entity24 pictured in @entity25 , @entity2 where they let out a three - bedroom property in @entity3 , a crackdown on holiday lets in the capital @entity29 as well as @entity31 and @entity32 is expected next week			1
if the new law is a success , the rest of the country could follow suit			2
in @entity2 , the authorities are expected to ban unlicensed rentals next spring			2
@entity40 , of holiday rental website @entity42 , warned : ‘ this law is closing the door to working and middle - class families who want to book a break to @entity2 at an affordable price			1
‘ instead of being able to share a whole house with friends , you face being stuck with your kids in a cramped hotel room			0
’ an estimated one million properties in @entity2 are owned by @entity0			0
many are inhabited all year round by expatriates but hundreds of thousands were bought as holiday homes			0
until recently , it has been relatively simple for @entity0 owners to rent out their properties in the two countries			1
but under the new rules , those with second homes in @entity2 will need a licence from the local council , which could incur a fee			0
laws : the crackdown could see @entity69 who own @entity71 villas , such as this one located between @entity72 and @entity2 pictured , adhering to much stricter guidelines ( library image ) they will also have to meet strict conditions , such as being contactable 24 hours a day to deal with problems such as water leaks or power blackouts			1
owners will have to pass regular safety inspections and obtain hygiene certificates			1
failure to comply will lead to hefty fines			0
in @entity3 , the new law will clamp down on homeowners in the three cities who let their second property to tourists			0
anybody – including @entity0 as well as @entity3 citizens – who rents one out for any period will be deemed to have changed its use , incurring a hefty penalty			0
most @entity0 - owned second homes in @entity2 and @entity3 are mortgaged and the owners let them for some of the year to cover bills without making a profit			1
this means the properties can be very good value for visitors			0
a family of four could pay £ 2,500 in high season to share a room in a hotel in @entity110 with flights booked through a tour operator			1
but renting a two - bedroom villa with a private pool would cost hundreds less at £ 1,700 including flights			1
@entity115 let owners @entity23 and @entity24 fear the shake - up could plunge them into a bureaucratic nightmare			1
the couple have lived in the scenic @entity71 fishing village of @entity25 for 13 years , where they let out a three - bedroom , two - bathroom villa advertised through an online booking site			1
but they fear the introduction of laws forcing holiday home owners to stick to strict conditions could make life harder for them and other @entity0 in the local @entity132 area			1
mr @entity23 , 66 , who also runs a holiday rental company , said : ‘ we do n’t mind sticking to the rules if it ’s simply a reasonable set of standards but it will be a pain in the neck if they ’re more onerous			0
even filling in a simple form in @entity2 can take two or three days ’ work			0
‘ the authorities often ask for a copy for this and a copy of that to go with the form but then will send everything back a few days later and ask for more information			0
‘ if the rules are too tough they will force holiday let owners out of the market , which would of course be good for hotels			1
i hope the authorities realise there is both a market for high class places but also for cheap places for families			2
’ tourists can cut costs further by renting bigger villas and sharing the cost with friends and family			2
private rentals have exploded in popularity among the 12million @entity0 who visit @entity2 each year			0
according to @entity172 bank , around three - quarters of overnight stays in @entity2 last year were in ‘ unregulated premises ’ such as privately - owned villas or apartments			1
most of these visitors booked directly through the high number of online holiday rental firms which have sprung up over the past decade			2
until now , in most parts of @entity2 , anyone can let out their homes provided they pay full tax and declare all revenues			2
but the recession - hit country is desperate to boost revenues and officials suspect that second - home owners are not paying billions of euros in tax			1
the powerful hotel industry has also been lobbying for the changes as the surge in private rentals is hitting its business			0
@entity196 , the @entity197 and the @entity198 already have tough restrictions			0
in the past year , thousands of apartment and villa owners in these areas have been fined up to £ 15,000 each			2
others have been banned from renting out property while hundreds have put their homes on the market			0
however , finding buyers has proved difficult because of a glut of sellers			0
@entity210 , president of a @entity212 support group for those hit by the shake - up , said : ‘ the only licences being granted are for hotels			1
inspectors trawl the internet and fine people found renting their homes			0
’ the clampdown will be a further blow to holiday homeowners in @entity2 , who have seen the value of their properties drop by up to 50 per cent since 2007			0
there are 200,000 @entity0 holiday homeowners in @entity3 , mostly in @entity227 , the @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
lawmakers in @entity232 will vote on similar laws in the next fortnight .			2

second - home owners on the *continent* targeted in controversial new laws
travelers will no longer be able to pay cheap rates direct to owners , but will have to stay in apartments , hotels of villas operated by major firms
crackdown could be implemented in @entity29 and @entity31 as early as next week
