a doctor who ploughed into an elderly couple in a 50mph head on crash while rushing to work has escaped prosecution after the police officer investigating the case went off sick			1
the female driver in a @entity9 pulled in front of @entity11 as he was driving his @entity12 on the @entity13 in @entity14 in @entity15 last year			1
the collision was captured on film as mr @entity11 had fitted a camera to his dashboard and revealed how he had no time to react and avoid the crash			1
but despite having evidence recorded on his dashcam , mr @entity11 has now been told there will be no further action because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time			1
the retired engineer from @entity46 in @entity15 , said : ' i contacted the police because i was keen to see a full prosecution to stop more careless driving			1
' but nothing has been done because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time			1
mr @entity11 has taken his case to the @entity56 after the driver who ploughed into his car will not face any further action after the investigating officer went off sick ' i think it is disgusting			1
if i was off sick somebody picked up my work			2
she has just got away with it and that 's that			0
' the pensioner has now contacted the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) and sent them a copy of the footage after learning there would be no further action			2
he added : ' i have written to the @entity56 and put my points across - it 's not only my case not acted upon , how many others have not been acted upon ? " ' the only way our roads are going to become safer is when motorists driving carelessly like this are punished			2
mr @entity11 with the footage on his computer			2
he says it is disgusting that there will be no action due the case not being picked up by another officer ' my wife and i were very lucky that we were not more seriously hurt and we are very disappointed that no police action has been taken in this case			1
' after the incident last year , the doctor driving the @entity9 also had to be cut from her vehicle and was taken to the @entity30 by air ambulance			1
it is understood she did not have serious injuries			0
the grandfather - of - seven explained : ' we were extremely lucky			0
i have a pacemaker and i thought my chest was going to explode			0
' we were both bruised right across where the seatbelts were			0
' it is a miracle that no one was more seriously hurt given that it was a serious head - on smash at 50mph			0
' i had very little time to brake because she turned right in front of me due to a lapse in concentration			0
" i feared the worst afterwards because she was trapped in her vehicle but thankfully she was not badly hurt , and was cut out by the @entity116			0
' a spokesman for @entity26 explained that there is a six - month period in which a prosecution would have to take place			0
this is the time limit set for summary offences , which are heard in a magistrates court to come to court			0
they also added that it was unfortunate that another officer failed to pick up the case instead			2
he said : ' officers attended the scene and carried out a thorough investigation			0
' an accident report was submitted with a recommendation for the driver to attend a @entity137			2
' unfortunately , the officer in the case was off sick and the report was not processed within the allocated time frame for prosecution			1

@entity11 was driving on the @entity13 when another car ploughed into his car
the whole incident was captured on film by a dashcam on his dashboard
he has been told the driver will not face any action over crash last year
this is because the police officer investigating the case had gone off sick
