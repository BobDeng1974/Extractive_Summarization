dead ' as the camera scans the cabin , she looks from one passenger to another and says : ' dead			2
' she then points at herself and says : ' alive			0
' a voice then comes through on the intercom which says , ' we wish you a pleasant flight '			0
the tagline then reads : ' @entity14 : at your own risk			1
' an explanation of the advert on @entity12 claims that @entity14 is the only ' relaxing ' drink on the market			1
it reads : ' it has one small disadvantage			0
