cosy knits , winter coats and sparkles are hot looks for @entity4 this season by @entity5 published : 11:59 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 30 november 2012 even at six months pregnant , @entity6 still manages to look bang on trend			1
from her cosy yet cool fur coats to her kooky knitted hats , the very designer and presenter never has a fashion faux pas			1
and now , she has passed on her words of wisdom speaking exclusively to @entity15 about her winter wardrobe staples			1
the presenter turned designer always has her style bang on trend and now she shares her secrets with @entity15 what are your three winter clothing staples ? good pair of tights , definitely – could n’t live without them			1
a good pair of boots , like i say those studded ones i ’ve been wearing to death at the moment			2
and just a really good , durable winter coat that still looks nice , so something faux fur or a nice tailored , warm coat			1
what are your favourite winter party wear trends this year ? over the years christmas-wise we ’ve done some really fun stuff , and you can be a bit extra glitzy and glam , so i ’ve done some that have been full - on sequins , i did one with a big bow on it , like a sequin dress that ’s really cute			1
one year i did this black dress with a big white sequin bow on it , so i think it ’s an opportunity to wear stuff that ’s slightly camper and more glitzy , so yeah , sequins and glitz			2
@entity4 's love of sequins was chanelled through her @entity62 dress that added some real sparkle to the stage have you got your ‘ @entity67 ’ look planned ? it ’s so difficult , i was looking for something glitzy to wear for @entity62 but it ’s very challenging having a body that does n’t fit normal clothes at the moment			1
so yeah , i guess it ’s just about being inventive , and probably more about a plain dress with a big , bejewelled necklace , something like that is probably going to be my winter staples this year			2
are there any fashion pieces on your @entity67 wishlist this year ? it ’ll probably unfortunately be slippers because i ’ll want to just be hibernating for a little while at @entity67			0
but yeah i ca n’t get enough of big , cosy jumpers , so knitwear at the moment , anything like that			2
and just good winter coats , ca n’t have too many of those – and also hats , love a winter hat , maybe a little beret or something like that			1
are you a last - minute christmas gift buyer , or do you plan way in advance ? i ’m doing my @entity67 gift shopping right now , as we speak , i ’m getting it done , i ’m not leaving it until the last minute this year , no way			0
i never usually leave it to the last minute but i usually do it in december			0
but this year i want it all done in november , so that ’s my aim and my goal			0
have you ever / would you ever consider spending @entity67 abroad somewhere hot and sunny ? i never have			2
i ’ve gone away for @entity110 most years but never for @entity67 because for me it ’s all about family and getting all of us out anywhere would be a nightmare because there ’s so many of us			0
so for me @entity67 is more about who i ’m with rather than where i ’m with , but if someone wants to take all of the @entity120 away one year to a tropical island i ’m not going to say no ! cosy knitwear and big cardigans are on @entity4 's wish list this @entity67 how will you be spending @entity67 and @entity126 this year ? just spending time with my family because i ’ll be huge by then ! and i would have just finished working , so it ’ll be a time to really start winding down and spending loads of time with my cousins and mum and dad and brother and boyfriend and his kids , so yep , just lots of food and family ! what ’s the best / worst @entity67 present you ’ve ever received ? best … i ’ve had lots of nice ones , i ’m very lucky			1
one year i got @entity142 , which i use more than anything i own , so that was a pretty good one			0
the worst … i ’m not going to say it was the worst , but the most unusual was my mum once sponsored me a tree in the @entity147			0
which is weird considering i will never see that tree , but it ’s there and i sponsor it , so that was quite a while back now			0
we love your @entity67 collection for very - what ’s your favourite piece / piece that you ’ve worn the most that you have designed ? i always go on things that i ’ve worn the most , and the two things that i ’ve definitely worn the most are the black boots with all the studs up the back , i ’ve worn to the point of them falling apart			0
and there was another pair of black boots , i think it was my second collection ages ago , that are just plain black flat boots , and i wore them so much that at @entity172 this year they fell apart and i had to leave them there , and i was like ‘ but i ca n’t get these again because they do n’t sell them anymore ! @entity176 ’ and i had to just put them in the bin , i was so upset about it			0
so those two pairs of boots i wore loads , and also in the @entity186 / @entity185 stuff that ’s on sale now , there ’s a cream faux fur coat that i wear all the time because it ’s so cosy and looks really glam and 50s , so i ’ve worn that loads and loads			2
last @entity67 saw @entity4 's very collection go retro with a @entity195 inspired look and it ’s always those pieces that i know – because a lot of my very stuff , because obviously there ’s so much of it coming in each season , and i wear as much of it as i can , i ’ll put a lot of it in storage so i can give it to my kids one day or whatever			1
and it all goes flat - pack in boxes , but then there ’s some pieces that never go in , like this cream coat definitely wo n’t , the boots wo n’t , a couple of the duffel coats from before i always keep out because i know that i ’ll wear them each year , so it ’s nice to have stuff that is n’t disposable , that will come back each winter or @entity219			1
have you got into using blogs for inspiration ? i do a bit , i tend to more so look at fashion shows online afterwards , because i do n’t really go to many because i find them utterly bizarre and terrifying ( apart from my own one , of course )			0
so yeah , i tend to look at a few blogs off of either shopping websites , obviously very have got one and there ’s other online stores that have them as well , and magazines like @entity234 have a whole fashion blog			0
despite being heavily pregnant , @entity4 still looks super stylish i look at magazine websites quite a lot but i try and limit my internet use for when i ’m just at @entity239 because i think the internet ’s quite evil , so i do n’t usually go on it when i ’m at home			1
so a lot of mine is more like magazine research , and books and stuff , and then the odd look at – if there ’s been a massive fashion show that i ’ve loved the look of – then i ’ll have a look through the pictures of it when it ’s been online			0
do you have any red carpet fashion rules ? you have to walk out the door feeling comfortable and confident , because if you walk out the door and think ‘ @entity262 , i feel really exposed in this ’ or uncomfortable or it ’s too tight , you ’re going to feel like crap all night , so just walk out the door feeling good			0
