her parents begged a gp to carry out a home visit but they refused one case involved a sum of £ 2.5million following a failure to refer a four - year - old child to hospital by a gp working out of hours			2
the child was later diagnosed with meningitis b and suffered severe disabilities , including the loss of a leg			0
the @entity12 said it is not unusual for cases to settle for well in excess of £ 1m because of the cost of providing care for disabled patients for the rest of their lives			1
of the 17 claims it settled in the four year period , five involved out - of - hours consultations and two , home visits			0
the mounting compensation bill has renewed pressure for the @entity53 to sanction the use of a new meningitis b vaccine , which was rejected in july by a panel of experts on the grounds that it was not cost - effective			1
the @entity60 , made up infectious disease experts , ruled against the life - saving jab and said more research was needed to confirm it was worth the cost of giving it to all infants			1
but meningitis charities last night said the soaring compensation pay - outs highlight the need for the vaccine to be introduced immediately			1
‘ we think this strengthens the argument for the vaccine to be introduced as soon as possible , ’ said @entity73 , head of research and medical information at the @entity76			0
@entity22 - now 12 - hopes to take part in the 2016 paralympics in @entity82 , racing the 100 metres on blades similar to those made famous by @entity85			2
she is pictured with her mother , @entity86 ‘ we know from our own research that 50 per cent of children with meningococcal disease are sent home the first time they see their gp			0
‘ yet these compensation payments are not included in the cost - effectiveness analysis on the vaccine			1
’ the foundation says millions more have been paid out by @entity98 hospital trusts over the last decade for children and adults harmed by failure to spot meningitis			0

the mounting compensation bill has renewed pressure on the @entity53 to sanction the use of a new meningitis b vaccine in 2011 , schoolgirl @entity22 won a £ 1.78m payout after losing both her legs as a baby when a @entity92 refused to carry out a home visit , despite pleas from her parents @entity117 and @entity118 , from @entity119 in @entity120			1

dr @entity126 , deputy head of claims at the @entity12 , said : ‘ meningitis is thankfully a rare disease , meaning most gps will only see one or two cases in a lifetime of practice			1
‘ but failure to diagnose it can have devastating consequences for patients , some of whom will suffer irreversible injuries such as brain damage , loss of limbs and organ damage			0
‘ this is reflected in the high costs of compensation payments , especially where cases involve children who may need care for many years to come			2
’ she said gps faced a major challenge because the early features of meningitis are often the same as those of minor viral illnesses			0
a vaccine against the meningitis c strain , introduced more than a decade ago , is thought to have saved thousands of lives			0

the vast majority are children under five			0
tests suggest the vaccine , called @entity168 , is effective against 73 per cent of the different subtypes of meningitis @entity171			2

many cases settle for more than £ 1m because of the cost of caring for a disabled person for the rest of their life
