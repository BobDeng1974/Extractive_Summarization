@entity1 ’s agent has revealed @entity2 rejected the chance to sign the @entity5 striker for £ 10million last summer – and insisted they will not get a second chance this year because they lack ambition			1
@entity2 are among a clutch of clubs believed to be keen on the @entity10 , who scored 25 goals in a stunning first season in south @entity14 following his £ 12m from @entity15 last summer			1
but @entity1 ’s agent @entity16 has told @entity2 that only a top - six club willing to spend £ 20m will land the 25 - year - old , and criticised @entity19 for not taking a punt on the striker this time last year after a season in which he scored 31 goals in 30 games in @entity26			1
no go : @entity1 will not be joining @entity2 this summer , according to the player 's agent ‘ they could have signed him for £ 10m , but they said they were n’t sure if he was good enough , that he was only playing in @entity26 , ’ @entity16 said			1
i brought him over from @entity33 and i know what he can do			0
i used to be a player and coach myself			0
‘ i told them that he would score goals wherever he played but it was only @entity39 ( the @entity5 chairman ) who took the risk			2
now he is worth £ 20m			0
‘ @entity2 is a traditional , fantastic club but they are always the same with transfers			2
i was in contact with them a couple of years ago over @entity44 , who played for @entity45 and @entity46 , but it was a similar story			0
’ spot on : @entity1 scored 16 times in his maiden season in @entity51 football he added : ‘ we have a certain strategy			1
@entity1 is in a totally different place to @entity2 and wants to move to a club with ambition			2
‘ we have had no contact with @entity2			0
’ @entity1 is an integral part to @entity60 ’s @entity5 side , but the striker has delivered mixed messages on his future , having reiterated his commitment to the club while also spelling out his understandable desire to play at a higher level			2
@entity5 have agreed a £ 6.5m fee for @entity70 striker @entity69 and a move is expected to be wrapped up when @entity39 and the player return from their respective summer breaks			1
his arrival is not seen as a precursor to @entity1 leaving , with @entity77 keen to enhance his striking options			0
@entity16 added : ‘ the next step for @entity1 is a top - six team in @entity51 or a top team in @entity82 , @entity83 or @entity84 , or he will stay with @entity5			0
