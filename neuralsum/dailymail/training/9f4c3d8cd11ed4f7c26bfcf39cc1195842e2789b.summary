by @entity1 science correspondent and @entity2 they are famed for making his nose grow - but @entity7 ’s lies could have been fatal , according to new research			2
scientists say the wooden puppet could only have told 13 fibs before his nose became so long and heavy that his neck snapped			1
in a bit of fun research , @entity14 , of @entity15 , began by estimating the dimensions and properties of @entity7 ’s head			2
the story of @entity7 became a huge hit when it was made into a popular @entity24 film in 1940 , but scientists say the puppet would not have been able to tell any more than 13 lies he then estimated that carved from oak , it would have weighed just over 9lb , with a nose an inch in length			1
if the nose doubled in length which each lie , the thirteenth would have put such a strain on his neck that it would have broken			1
the researcher said he realised that the ability of @entity7 's nose to grow was ' extraordinary '			1
he added : ' nevertheless , this unique ability can be of great concern for the puppet , and lengthy , extensive lies are advised against , for the health and wellbeing of @entity7			2
' the analysis of the children ’s favourite by @entity51 is detailed in the @entity52 which showcases fun but accurate science done by students			0
@entity51 , @entity7 's creator , has had the science behind his famous character tested by scientists the researcher 's theory was not tested in the popular tale , as in the original story , written by the @entity64 author in 1883 , the puppet only told three lies			1
the study is the latest report to examine the myths and science behind popular cartoons and fairytales			0
last year , researchers claimed that the legendary strengthening effect that eating spinach had on cartoon character @entity73 was born out of a mathmatical mistake by a @entity79 scientist			0
in 1870 , @entity79 chemist @entity80 was researching the amount of iron in spinach and other green vegetables			0
when writing up his findings in a new notebook , he misplaced a decimal point , making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality			0
the story goes that cartoon creators were aware of the supposedly miraculous health properties of spinach spread by the erroneous research and had the idea that @entity73 should eat spinach to increase his strength .			0

scientists have tested how long the character 's nose could have grown
*experts* at @entity15 worked out the weight each lie would add
they calculated the strain on his neck , assuming he was made from oak
the *physics* behind the story means he could have only told 13 lies
