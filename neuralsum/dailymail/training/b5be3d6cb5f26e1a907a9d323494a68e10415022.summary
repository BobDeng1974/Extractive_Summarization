the @entity0 starts hearing arguments tuesday in a case that may determine how employers handle hiring and firing of marijuana users			0
in spite of pot being legal in @entity9 , employers can still fire employees for their toking habits , as being a pot smoker is not yet a protected class			0
the case was brought to the court by @entity15 , 35 , a quadriplegic who was fired by @entity16 in 2010 after marijuana was found in his system			1
the spasms were due to @entity15 's being paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager			1
the firing came after a random drug test was administered to @entity15 after he had been employed with @entity16 for three years			1
@entity15 apparently informed his supervisors ahead of time he would fail the test , since @entity34 , the active ingredient in pot , stays in the system for weeks after it enters the body			2
the @entity39 reports that @entity15 's lawyers are challenging his firing using a rule meant to ensure cigarette smokers can not be targeted for smoking off the job			1
; attitudes are changing toward marijuana			0
laws are going to have to change , too , ' said @entity15 , who has not been able to find an employer who would hire him after @entity16			2
' i 'd like for this to enable people like me to find employment without being looked down upon			0
' @entity16 has argued in complaints that companies like it in @entity9 would have to keep employees with ' marijuana - induced performance problems , ' and could lose federal contracts if @entity15 wins			1
currently , @entity16 is using federal employment law , which bans marijuana use , to argue that their firing was legal			0
@entity9 has led the fight for legalizing marijuana , with voters approving an initiative allowing medical marijuana use in 2000 , followed by the approval of recreational marijuana in 2013 .			0

@entity15 , 35 , was fired by @entity16 , his employer of three years after a random drug test turned up signs of @entity34
