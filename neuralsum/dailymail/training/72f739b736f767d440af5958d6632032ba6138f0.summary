getting help : @entity1 's lawyer @entity14 ( @entity15 ) appeared in court on thursday morning while at the same time the actress was entering a rehab facility the 26 - year - old was sentenced to the stint in the facility after pleading no contest to charges for lying to police about driving during a car crash last june			1
at the exact time @entity28 was entering the @entity30 based centre , her lawyer @entity14 was in court			1

checking in : according to reports @entity28 entered the @entity30 centre at 8.45am to start her 90 day stint under fire : it has been claimed that @entity10 can not offer treatment after its licence was revoked as going to a different centre that was not approved by the court technically broke her plea agreement , the star ’s attorney was required to appear before a judge			1
@entity14 , who wore an eyesore of a tie in red and black stripes for the hearing , was attempting to convince judge @entity53 to approve of the switch			0
he argued that as @entity28 has already entered and is ‘ ensconced ’ in the program , it could effect her recovery should she have to move facilities			0
revoked : the @entity60 rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients @entity63 's finest : police were seen surrounding @entity10 as @entity28 checked in @entity28 's living quarters : the rehab facility features quaint interiors , as this photograph reveals ‘ she 's going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today , ’ @entity14 explained , reinforcing that the star is ‘ commencing immediate treatment ’			1

a representative clarified to @entity99 that it can , however treat outpatients			0
' @entity10 ca n’t provide residential treatment to anyone , but they can provide outpatient services , ' the rep explained			0
the judge however did n’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to that particular facility , despite the fact that it was not one on a list of six centres approved by the court			0
convincing : @entity28 chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so @entity14 was attempting to get the judge to ok the decision fighting his corner : the switch to a different rehab technically violates @entity28 's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved ‘ it does appear to comply , ’ judge @entity53 said , adding that the prosecution had eight days to decide whether or not they will agree with the centre being approved			1

@entity14 and @entity158 of the prosecution will reconvene in front of the judge on may 10 , at which point it will be determined whether or not they will set a date for a restitution hearing			2

final moments of freedom : on wednesday @entity28 spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain - smoking ' if [ @entity158 ] says he 's satisfied then i do n't think we have to come back , ' @entity14 said , adding , ' i 'm 100 % sure he will be satisfied			1
' @entity14 then claimed that he will ' make sure [ @entity28 ] stays in therapy ' , and had called in the coo of @entity10 in the hope that she could win over @entity158			2
