@entity0 and @entity1 will not have to share revenue from @entity4 television rights after the @entity6 government backed out of a plan to bring in a law that would force them to do so			1
@entity6 ’s big two between them take £ 204million of the total £ 550m pot every season and the other clubs , who wanted legislation to force them to reduce their share , are now considering going on strike if the government do n't lift their block on the new law being passed			1
the rest of @entity23 was also keen to see the new law because @entity0 and @entity1 earn far more than some of their main @entity26 rivals from television deals			0
@entity0 and @entity1 will continue to pocket the vast majority of @entity4 's tv sponsorship the likes of @entity31 and @entity32 continue to attract large tv audiences due to their stature the combined tv earnings from @entity23 's top leagues last season - led by the @entity37 in @entity40 , @entity39 earned around £ 27m in the 2013 - 14 season from the @entity43 contract , @entity38 earned £ 67m and @entity44 32			1
in @entity47 , on the other hand , @entity45 were the top earners with £ 99m closely followed by @entity49 on £ 98m – both behind @entity0 and @entity1			0
@entity6 sports minister @entity50 had been keen to wave through a change but he has been overruled leaving the other clubs furious and , according to @entity53 , set to meet next week to discuss the possibility of stopping the league with strike action			1
in the 2013 - 14 season @entity57 earned less than any other @entity37 club , £ 64m and yet still made more than twice as much as @entity4 winners @entity59 in @entity6 who earned £ 31m from television revenue			0
@entity63 earn the third highest amount in @entity6 football but the £ 35m they pick up per season is still dwarfed by that £ 102 premium given to both @entity0 and @entity1			2
@entity45 earned the most amount of tv money in the @entity37 last season @entity39 earned just over £ 27m in tv sponsorship last season while @entity38 came out in top in @entity73 at @entity76 , @entity75 ’ club must cope on just £ 18m a season while as many as five clubs in the 2013 - 14 season in @entity6 only made £ 13m			2
@entity0 and @entity1 had both indicated they would be prepared to give up their advantage but the other clubs wanted it written in the statutes to avoid close season bickering every time a deal was up for renewal			0
the other clubs had assured @entity0 and @entity1 they would still get € 140m because by joint - bargaining the total money made from the first combined deal would move up from £ 550 closer to £ 730m by that dream now looks in tatters			2
clubs will go on negotiating deals separately with @entity0 and @entity1 both having already agreed deals for next season again over the of £ 100m mark .			0

@entity4 *giants* @entity0 and @entity1 take majority of tv pot in @entity6
@entity6 's big two sides take £ 204million of the total £ 550m pot each season
the @entity6 government planned to make change to tv money rule
however they *'ve* been overruled , leaving the rest of @entity4 side 's furious
