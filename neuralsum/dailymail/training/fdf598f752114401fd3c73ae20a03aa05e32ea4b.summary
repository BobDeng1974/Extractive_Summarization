the party ’s over , and for the 10,000 @entity4 disciples who frolicked into the wee small hours at @entity6 ’s re-election shindig in his hometown of @entity8 , it ’s time to call it a day			1
yet as the grassroots campaigners began wending their way back to all corners of @entity15 , still clutching the flags they had waved till their arms went numb , the mood among them was far from euphoric			1
rather , there was a sense of sheer relief			2
@entity15 president @entity6 , accompanied by wife @entity21 and his daughters at the re-election party in @entity8 relief that @entity26 ’s worrying late surge had been repelled ; relief that poll predictions of a @entity30 upset had proved ill - founded ; and relief that the bitter , protracted struggle to spare their @entity33 the ignominy of a one - term presidency was finally over			1
how very different it was , this muted @entity38 , from that november night four years ago , when i stood among 250,000 @entity15 of every colour , creed and age to watch the nation ’s first black president take his place in history			2
then , @entity6 ’s nebulous promises of ‘ hope and change ’ were alone enough to kindle a great outpouring of joy and goodwill that bridged all divisions , but this time round the spontaneity was gone , and the celebrations seemed too triumphal , given the parlous state of the nation ; and too schmaltzy and slickly choreographed			1
for those millions who watched it all on tv , i am told , the victory rally at the @entity59 – a vast , soulless and windowless steel - and - glass exhibition hall built for trade fairs – looked impressive enough			2
@entity15 president @entity6 gestures with vice president @entity65 after his election night victory speech in @entity8 the left - leaning stars turned out for @entity6 as usual ( a veritable array including @entity69 and the ubiquitous will.i.am ) ; the backdrop of shimmering , red and blue satin curtains was suitably dramatic , and the jukebox selections – from @entity75 ’s @entity76 to @entity78 ’s @entity77 – were a thematic masterstroke			1
behind the scenes , however , rather like the @entity15 economy , it was all rather shambolic			2
only the a-listers had seats ; the hoi - poloi were forced to stand for hours without refreshments on a bare linoleum floor as they waited for the so - called people ’s president to address them			2
the acoustics were so awful that you could barely make out what @entity6 was saying at the back of the hall , and with the world ’s press trying to relay their stories , the internet – a tool the @entity100 have used to devastating effect – went on the blink			1
‘ how can he hope to fix the economy when he ca n’t fix the freaking @entity106 , ’ quipped one frustrated @entity15 reporter standing near me			2
@entity6 's disciples were relieved rather than euphoric after his re-election was confirmed supporters cheer at president @entity6 's election night party where the hoi - poloi were forced to stand for hours without refreshments how indeed ? since there was n’t any sound to accompany the news bulletins flickering on six giant screens either , it meant that people watching the night unfold from their armchair had a far better idea what was going on than those of us corralled in the darkened hall			1
below us , the @entity100 throngs were similarly unenlightened , some nervously failing to grasp that – though the electoral college vote showed @entity26 ahead until 10pm [ 3am @entity132 time ] – the projected results meant an @entity6 victory was then all but assured			1
history will record that the result was first declared by @entity137			0
by my watch it was 10.15pm , [ 3.15am in @entity132 ] and the hall erupted			0
‘ four more years ! four more years ! ’ the crowd chanted , whooping and waving their little flags			0
for them it was a cry of deliverance , but for almost half of this divided nation it must have sounded as though they were handing down a sentence			0
@entity6 , who was so unsure of the outcome that he had prepared two speeches , one for victory , the other for defeat , expressed his relief – and thanks – by way of a @entity161 message			1
‘ great headline , ’ someone behind me chimed			0
‘ victory is tweet ! ’ another reporter preferred the more caustic : ‘ @entity6 bailed out			1
’ left - leaning stars including musician will.i.am turned out at @entity6 's re-election party @entity26 conceded at 11.52pm [ 4.52am in @entity132 ] , and a few minutes later he was making his concession speech , the graciousness of which contrasted sharply with the mocking catcalls and whistles from @entity6 ’s watching supporters			1
for some unfathomable reason , they were made to suffer for a further 44 minutes – like fans at a rock concert awaiting the top - billing act – before the @entity33 and his family finally took to the stage			0
four years ago , he had promised to bring a new spirit of unity to @entity15			0
it was a measure of his failure to achieve that pledge that his tone was conciliatory , almost chastened			0
he spoke of ‘ ending the gridlock ’ , ‘ building consensus ’ and making ‘ difficult compromises ’			0
his speech , though sprinkled with the usual patriotic and sentimental homilies , was measured and cautionary : worlds apart from the ‘ @entity198 ’ mantra that electrified us on that warm night in @entity197			0
only the a-listers , including @entity200 , left , and @entity201 , right , were given seats at the @entity8 event four years ago , as i walked back to my hotel , awe - stricken , i gladly accepted the hugs of strangers and even stopped to purchase an @entity6 t - shirt from a street hawker			1
yesterday the souvenirs were on offer again – trademarked and only available from official vendors ( ‘ pet apparel ’ was going for $ 10 , and golf accessories cost $ 5 )			0
this time my wallet stayed firmly in my pocket			0
yet though @entity6 has proved to be all too mortal , we should n’t forget how far he has come – nor how his narrative has inspired millions of less fortunate @entity15 , not least the black children of @entity8 ’s appallingly blighted @entity220 , a few miles from the scene of his latest triumph			1
for them , he remains a symbol of the dreams that can still be achieved in this great but troubled country			0
tomorrow he must strive anew to live up them .			0

the re-election party is over and it 's back to business for @entity6
supporters were relieved that @entity26 's worrying late surge had been repelled
