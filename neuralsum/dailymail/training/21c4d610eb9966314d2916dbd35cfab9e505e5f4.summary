@entity1 striker @entity0 insists another fight for @entity4 survival has never crossed his mind			1
the 21 - year - old scored his fourth goal of the season in saturday 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity10 which hauled the @entity1 into 14th place and four points clear of the drop zone			1
it was their first win in the league in six attempts since december 21 and just their second of the season at the @entity20			1
@entity0 heads @entity1 's opener past @entity10 goalkeeper @entity22 @entity24 fans look on in expectation as @entity0 leaps highest to head home a vital goal however , @entity0 , whose five goals in three games at the end of last season provided the platform for the club 's unlikely great escape , has never even considered the prospect of having to produce a similar fightback this time around			1
he said : " you can never guarantee you are safe - you just have to look at last season			0
we were seven points adrift and then we managed to avoid it			2
i do n't think anybody can guarantee safety until it 's mathematical , so we are not even thinking about that			2
" obviously the aim is to stay in the @entity4 and do the best we can , but i do n't think - well , for me personally , relegation has never crossed my mind , so it should n't for the team either			1
" @entity1 january acquisition @entity48 embraces manager @entity50 in the 2 - 0 home win head coach @entity50 , despite his delight at a performance and result which answered his pre-match challenge to make the game a turning point in a difficult season , was swift to warn his team they had done little more than start a process which needs to continue over the weeks and months ahead			1
however , the manner in which victory was achieved will have come as a welcome relief as his efforts to find a system in which new signing @entity48 could prosper finally paid dividends			2
having abandoned the three - man defence he had employed in the previous two fixtures , he opted for a system which allowed @entity0 to support @entity48 and full - backs @entity70 and @entity71 to get forward , and that proved to be @entity10 's undoing			1
strike partners @entity0 and @entity48 appeal to the referee during the @entity4 clash with @entity10 @entity0 headed home @entity70 's 20th - minute cross to open the scoring and when @entity48 slid home @entity82 's pull - back 14 minutes later for his first @entity1 goal , the points were secure			1
the former @entity86 frontman said : " we played well as a team and we looked comfortable			0
i have not had much of a chance to play in a game situation with @entity48			2
on saturday , we got the opportunity and we both managed to score , which is good			0
" it was not a good day , however , for the @entity10 , who left @entity95 sitting just one place and a single point above the relegation zone			1
they were poor in the first half , although @entity101 might have headed them into an early lead , and while they rallied after the break , they never really looked like rescuing the situation			0
@entity10 manager @entity108 gives his squad some pointers during the game at the @entity20 manager @entity108 said : " that is life in the @entity4			1
we have been learning , we are improving , i am sure of that , over the season			0
we are still on good shape			0
" i always remind you people thought we would need snookers at @entity122 and we did n't , and we are still active			0
" it 's a learning curve for these players on a weekly basis and it 's another big reminder that you have to be on top of your game for every minute , certainly when you are us			2
we ca n't come away from our performance levels and we had too many down			0
" at any level of football , it 's improbable that every player on your team plays at the top level of their performance every week			0
but we ca n't carry threes and fours if they are not on their levels			0
if you are @entity148 , maybe @entity149 , @entity151 et cetera , if they have three or four players who are well below par , they can still carry that			0
we need everyone at it all of the time			0
" @entity108 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) go head to head on the sidelines during saturday 's game			1

@entity0 opened the scoring in @entity1 's win over @entity10
it was the @entity1 ' first @entity4 win since december
@entity50 's side are now four points clear of the relegation zone in 14th
@entity48 secured all three points with his first goal for the club
