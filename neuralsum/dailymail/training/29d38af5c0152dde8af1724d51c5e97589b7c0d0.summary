@entity0 may have been some way from full fitness at this @entity3 but he still managed to leave his mark , scoring his 50th goal for @entity6 and becoming the first player from his nation to score in three consecutive finals			1
@entity11 ’s side won 2 - 1 against @entity12 at the @entity13 thanks to @entity0 ’s late winner , but the three points were not enough to take them above @entity17 , who lost 1 - 0 to @entity19 in the group ’s other game			2
while the likes of @entity25 and @entity26 have lit up the tournament with some sensational individual displays , their @entity23 counterpart has struggled			0
@entity43 showed against @entity44 how great players are able to summon moments of brilliance even when they are clearly far from full fitness			0
and against @entity17 in @entity6 ’s previous match @entity0 was able to do the same , saving the day for @entity11 ’s side by swinging a perfect cross for @entity51 to head home at the back post to make it 2 - 2 in the dying stages			2
hounded : @entity0 was given no time on the ball by @entity12 's right - back @entity57 booking : @entity60 receives a yellow card after a handful of fouls on the @entity6 star @entity65 and tumble : @entity0 limps away after the @entity68 foul that led to a booking but , with @entity6 requiring not just a victory but also a five - goal swing in their favour to have any hope of progressing to the last 16 , it would have taken something superhuman from the @entity77 star to drag his side through			1
very rarely @entity0 falls short on the football field , but on this occasion he almost had no say in the matter			0
he started the @entity12 match well , summoning the spirit of @entity85 circa 2002 by crashing an effort against the bar that looked suspiciously like a cross in the sixth minute			0
then midway through the half only a stunning point - blank save from @entity90 stopped him from making it 1 - 0 with a thumping header at the back post			0
so close : the @entity77 attacker looks set to put @entity6 ahead with a free header at the back post wonder save : but his effort was kept out by some fine goalkeeping by @entity90 celebrate : @entity90 pumped his fists into the air after saving the header , as @entity0 turned in desperation @entity6 were ahead shortly after , when @entity0 ’s nemesis for the day @entity105 fired an acrobatic own goal past @entity90 from close range			1
determined : when @entity105 scored an own goal @entity0 grabbed the ball and ran back to the centre circle a smart finish from @entity112 drew @entity12 level on the hour mark , before @entity0 appealed in vain for a penalty after being felled by @entity105 inside the box			2
with 10 minutes to play @entity0 rattled a low strike into the bottom right corner after some shambolic defending from @entity12 saw the ball fall to him 10 yards out			1
crisp finish : @entity0 makes history by scoring in three consecutive @entity3 finals for @entity6 bowing out : @entity0 walks slowly back to the @entity6 half knowing that his side are heading out the goal had little impact on the final standings in @entity129 it lifted @entity6 above @entity12 into third , but @entity17 ’s superior goal difference meant they join @entity19 in the knockout rounds			1
@entity0 , well aware of this , celebrated accordingly			0
a short shrug and then a slow walk back to his own half			0
maybe after the game he will reflect more proudly on a finish that takes his tally to 50 for @entity6 and makes him the first @entity39 player to score in three consecutive @entity3 finals			1
til next time @entity141 : the @entity6 captain cut a frustrated figure as his team crashed out of the @entity3			2

the @entity6 striker scored the winner with 10 minutes to go
the goal was the @entity77 forward 's 50th for his country
he becomes the first @entity6 player to score in three @entity155
the win means @entity6 finish in third place in @entity129
