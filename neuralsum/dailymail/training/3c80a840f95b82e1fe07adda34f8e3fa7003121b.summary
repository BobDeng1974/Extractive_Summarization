it is a unique view of the @entity2 - and one that resembles the hit move @entity5 rather than the @entity6 , usually associated with the strip			1
air force pilots from the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 descended on @entity2 this week for a military exercise that has run since 1975 to test tactics , planes and pilots			1
called red flag , this year it included aircraft and personnel from 21 different @entity9 military squadrons , as well as the @entity21 and the @entity10 's @entity22			1
the view from a @entity21 @entity24 , assigned to @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity11 , lands after a training mission during @entity28 15 - 1 at @entity29 , @entity30 on february 9th 2015			1
since its establishment in 1975 , @entity28 has played host to military units from more than 30 countries			1
@entity28 is the @entity22 's premier air - to - air combat training exercise , and was first run in 1975			1
participants often include both @entity9 and allied nations ' combat air forces			1
the exercise gives pilots the experience of mulitple , intensive air combat sorties in the safety of a training environment			2
' @entity28 still accomplishes the original objective it set out to in 1975 , ' said lt. col. @entity48 , @entity49 commander			1
' it provides realistic training to make our force more survivable in combat			2
' what makes @entity28 so relevant and important , he said , is that it has evolved commensurate with real world operations and threats			2
' @entity28 deliberately incorporates lessons learned from real world operations , past @entity60 , weapons school training , and changes to meet the needs of the combat air forces and the war fighters , ' he said			1
' they 've developed a variety of extremely difficult scenarios that build on each other from day to day so we are n't going out to execute the same mission over and over again			0
' those scenarios are n't simply challenges for fighter pilots			0
cyber and space operators have been included in the @entity28 exercises for nearly a decade , and @entity78 elements were fully integrated in 2011 at the tactical level , from planning through execution and debrief , according to a 24th @entity22 @entity83 release			1
col @entity87 , @entity28 15 - 1 @entity85 wing commander and 48th fighter wing vice commander , said deployment and defense of assets across each element -- air , space and cyberspace -- is critical to the modern warfighter			1
' in the 1970 's , when @entity28 began , much of the technology we rely on today was still developing , and was n't yet part of day - to - day employment , ' he said			1
' today , everything overlaps across the domains , and they continue to evolve			0
cyber warfare absolutely affects our capabilities , and defense of space in the future will be very important			2
' @entity28 , @entity87 said , is the pinnacle of training environments			1
called red flag , this year it included aircraft and personnel from 21 different @entity9 military squadrons , including the @entity115 seen here , as well as the @entity21 and the @entity10 's @entity22			1
' when our crews , maintainers , cyber operators , and air operations center and support personnel leave this exercise , they will all have been pushed to their own limits			2
they will understand just how crucial their own performance and success is to the success of the entire mission , ' he said			0
' nowhere else will you find such a coordinated environment to test every aspect of our warfighting capabilities			0
nowhere else will you find such a well - trained team dedicated purely to replicating the best of the threats , challenges and issues we may face in combat operations , ' he said			0
@entity87 , who has attended nine @entity60 in 20 years , said the ultimate reason we train and operate with our allies at complex flag exercises is to improve our performance and prepare for those real - world operations			0
' in today 's world , the likelihood of going to combat without our sister services , allies , and partners is almost nil , ' he said			0
' therefore , we want to maximize our opportunities to push our own limits alongside those warriors with whom we will fight when called upon			0
' @entity87 said he 's seen the level of international integration improve dramatically since his first @entity28 experience as a @entity162 co-pilot in 1995			2
' we used to spend the entire time trying to figure out how each other spoke , in different terminologies			0
it took time to learn how to best communicate and interact , ' he said			0
now we walk in on the same page , ready to fight			0
we already speak a common tactical language			0
' the relationships built and strengthened here will pay huge dividends in future combat operations , @entity87 said			0
' it 's that much less time we 'll need to spend getting familiar with how we operate separately , he said , ' since we 've already done this tough exercise as one cohesive warfighting team			2
