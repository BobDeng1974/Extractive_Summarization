you do realise you 've walked into the best windsurfing centre in the world ? ' announces our instructor , @entity3 , at the beginning of our first lesson at @entity7			1
while these surfer dudes tend to lean towards hyper - enthusiasm ( everything is ' totally awesome ' or ' epic ' ) , i think he may be right on this one			1
we can sense it the second we arrive at this windsurfing hotspot on the southern end of @entity19 island in @entity20			1
our welcoming committee of caramel - coloured instructors eye up the new arrivals through their @entity24			1
staying on her feet ( for now ) : @entity26 gets to grips with the art of wind - surfing in sunny @entity19 when my friend and i wander down to the beach , we see an exhilarating display of one hundred windsurfers skimming across the water like dragonflies			1
we sit drooling on the sand and make a pact to be professional standard by the end of the week			2
how hard can it be ? everyone at @entity45 - a hotel and windsurf school - has the same obsession			1
while the converted flock here annually for their fix , it 's also the perfect training ground for beginners			2
thanks to its position in a thumb - shaped inlet , enclosed on three sides by mountains , this watery playground has its own weather system , which runs like clockwork during the summer			1
a light onshore breeze sees the novices through until lunchtime			2
by early afternoon , the heat pressure behind the western mountain has built up so the wind whooshes down into the bay			1
off come the rookies , on go the pros			2
there are numerous watersports centres along @entity75 beach , but @entity45 , which has been here since 1987 , is the place to be			1
it has more @entity80 advanced instructors than any other centre in the world			2
they are wonderfully sympathetic to our incompetence , despite some of them being ranked among the @entity88 's top professional windsurfers ( the hotel walls are lined with shots of them in action , including one of a chiselled freestyler above my bed which prompts a nightly sigh )			2
on day one , @entity3 shows us how to climb on to the board , haul the sail up and do a static turn ( wafting the sail across the back of the board to turn 180 degrees )			0
i feel like a new - born foal trying out my legs for the first time			1
we all plop in the sea constantly , but it is bathwater warm with a sandy bottom			0
sometimes i fall in on purpose			0
mornings begin with @entity20 yogurt and honey before our lesson at 10.30am			1
we return at lunchtime to refuel , then it 's back to the water to practise			0
more than 250 boards and sails are lined up for the taking , and when you traipse floppily off the water after your session , one of the beach staff magically appears to put it all back for you			0
it 's not all about the windsurfing			0
there are mountain bikes , yoga classes , fitness sessions , paddle boarding and a bustling @entity135			0
stroll along the beach to @entity138 for a competitive line - up of seaside tavernas offering tzatziki , fried courgette and giant meaty skewers , or nip eastwards to the pretty bay of @entity145 where we gorge on fresh fish and watch yachts bobbing			1
the social scene at @entity45 is a big draw , says a university graduate , here for his sixth summer			0
every evening , guests at the beach bar swap anecdotes about their windsurfing feats			0
i throw in a bit of lingo about ' heli tacks ' and ' duck gybes ' , but give the game away on the water the next morning when a girl from my table at dinner glides past and waves			0
i return the gesture and topple off			0
on our final , gusty afternoon i 'm first on the water			0
leaning my full weight back against the sail , the board slices through the sea			0
not with my instructor ( well , not just with my instructor ) , but with this utterly thrilling sport			0
a seven - night stay at @entity45 ( 0844 463 0191 , www.clubvass.com ) costs from Â£ 599 per person , including flights from @entity182 , transfers , windsurfing tuition , mountain biking and stand - up - paddle boarding .			1

@entity188 is one of the most *northerly* of the @entity20 islands
often lost in the shadow of @entity194 , it is a *destination* of *quiet* charm
it is also a great place to learn to wind - surf - as our *writer* discovers
