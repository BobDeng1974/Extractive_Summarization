by @entity0 @entity1 is recalling more than 6.5milllion cars spanning nearly 30 models - including 2.3 million in @entity4 and 35,000 in the @entity5 - after it discovered a number of faults			1
the car manufacturer found in some models airbags can deactivate , seats may move and steering columns could break , the company said today			2
no injuries or crashes have been reported related to the recalls but two reports of fires are linked to one of the problems , a defective engine starter that can keep the motor running			0
@entity23 recall : 35,000 @entity1 vehicles , including the @entity25 , have been found to have potentially dangerous faults faulty : the models involved include the @entity28 , @entity25 , @entity29 , @entity30 - one of which is pictured here , the @entity31 , and @entity32			1
by region , the latest recall affects 2.3 million vehicles in @entity4 , 1.09 million vehicles in @entity37 and 810,000 vehicles in @entity39			1
other regions affected by the recall include @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44			0
the models involved include the @entity28 , @entity25 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32			1
the @entity46 and the @entity47 are also affected			0
in some @entity25 and @entity49 models , @entity1 said there was a risk that the driver 's airbag may be deactivated because turning the steering wheel could damage certain circuits , causing the airbag warning light on the instrument panel to illuminate			1
in some @entity30 and @entity66 models a spring mechanism locking the driver and , in three - door cars , the front passenger seats in position on the adjustment rails may be under - strength and could break if seats are frequently moved back and forwards			1
if the spring breaks , seats may not lock in position and could move in a crash , @entity1 said			1
in the same models , a weld connecting the steering column bracket to the instrument panel might break when the steering wheel is repeatedly turned with full force , which could cause the steering column to tilt out of position			0
drivers would not lose control of their vehicle			0
@entity1 said customers would have their cars inspected and repaired free and urged people to check if their vehicle was affected by looking up its registration on the company website			2
@entity1 was embroiled in a massive recall crisis in the @entity92 starting in late 2009 and continuing through 2010 , covering a wide range of problems including faulty floor mats , sticky gas pedals and defective brakes			2
danger : models including the @entity66 are affected by a global @entity1 recall after concerns were raised over airbag faults and fire risks last month , the @entity37 automaker reached a settlement with the @entity106 to pay a $ 1.2 billion penalty for hiding information about defects in its cars			1
it earlier paid fines of more than $ 66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems			0
the @entity116 never found defects in electronics or software in @entity1 cars , which had been targeted as a possible cause			2
the @entity46 , which is a @entity121 model , is involved because @entity1 and @entity121 made cars at the same plant in @entity124 and the recalled model is the same as the @entity29			0
@entity47 is partly owned by @entity1 , and the model was the same as the @entity47 .			0

@entity1 is recalling 6.5 million cars worldwide including 2.3 million in @entity4 and 35,000 in the @entity5
problems span 30 models including the @entity25 , @entity49 , @entity30 and the @entity66
