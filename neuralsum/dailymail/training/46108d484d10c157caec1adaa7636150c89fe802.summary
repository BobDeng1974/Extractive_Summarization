by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 12:40 est , 20 march 2012 it looks like the unlikeliest collection of holiday snaps , but this gnome is not on holiday - the trip is all in the name of science			1
gravity changes around the world , partly due to bulges in our planet 's shape			1
to prove it , a @entity16 scale manufacturer has sent a plastic figure on a journey around the planet			2
kern the gnome is weighed wherever he goes			2
@entity22 was at his heaviest at the south pole , where the slower spin of the @entity25 adds 0.5 per cent to everyone 's weight			1
write caption here write caption here so far he has visited a string of cities including @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 in the southwest @entity39			0
@entity22 travels in a reinforced case containing himself and a @entity41 calibrated according to local gravity in @entity43 , @entity16 , to ensure any weight change he encounters on his travels shows up			1
the journey has been organised by scale makers @entity48 as a fun way to demonstrate the little known quirk about @entity25 , that gravity varies depending on where you are			1
each place he visits is accompanied by pictures of @entity22 taken by scientists friends who are ‘ putting him up ’ and a blog he has supposedly written			0
when @entity22 was in @entity59 he was weighed at 309.82g , the heaviest out of all his visits			1
on his blog he writes : ‘ i am a gnome celebrity today			0
but i wo n’t let this fame make me big headed			0
the change in weight could throw out all of my future results			2
’ gnome south pole @entity68 gnome moving further towards the equator , @entity22 weighed 307.8g in @entity37 and 307.82g in @entity70 , @entity71 , which is roughly the same latitude			2
in @entity73 he writes : ‘ i ’ve lost weight			2
who else can say that after @entity76 ? i ’m in @entity73 and i weigh 307.56g			0
‘ thanks to my hosts for helping me with this pleasantly surprising measurement			0
now i ’m leaving the amazing sights , sounds and smells of @entity73 and hopping on a long haul flight to @entity35			0
roll me an enchilada , i ’ll see you all in 19.5 hours time ! ’ by the time he arrived in @entity35 , however , the weight seemed to have gone back on and he weighed some 307.62g			1
gravity does indeed differ around @entity25 , partly because it is not a sphere and is actually shaped more like a potato			1
gravity is affected by two main factors - latitude and altitude			1
if you were to stand on one of the two poles on @entity25 then you would weigh 0.5 per cent more than if you were on the equator			1
this is because at the poles there is less rotation which reduces your weight			0
differences in local geology may also play a part , but on a far smaller scale			0
having large rocks near to you may change your weight by 0.01 per cent			0
if you would like @entity22 the gnome to visit you then go to the websitehttp : / / www.gnomeexperiment.com /			0

@entity111 is weighed in locations around the world to check how changes in gravity affect his weight
plastic *ornament* was heaviest at @entity119
@entity25 's ' potato - like ' shape means gravity is not the same everywhere
