the nearest i 've come to handling an animal for dinner is stuffing a turkey for @entity5 dinner			0
so when posed with the question - would i butcher an animal to eat ? - by a vegetarian , i answered yes , i would be able to slice and chop a rack of meat , without a care in the world			1
and now i had to prove it			0
brits eat an average of 84kg per person of meat annually - with chicken and and pork the most popular type that we consume			1
however , as more people are concerned with buying locally , and making sure animals are fed organically and reared humanely , there are more questions being asked how our food is sourced			1
as a carnivore , i 'll happily eat bacon , ham , chops , pies and joints - and now i had to prove that i would be willing and able to carve it myself			2
i had n’t given much thought to how it went from a living , breathing creature to ending up on my plate until i went to @entity58 in @entity59 to learn how to butcher a pig with some help from part - owner and head chef @entity62			1
@entity62 butchers all the meat in the restaurant himself – a fact he is justifiably proud of			1
the 28 - year - old trained at @entity68 and has worked in restaurants in @entity70 and as a head trainer at @entity73 ’s @entity72			2
his passion and enthusiasm are infectious – my worries at tackling the task quickly fade as he assures me that i will be fine			0
head chef and part owner @entity62 ( right ) guides the writer as she slices through the carcass elbow grease : sawing through the rib of the pig was the toughest part of the process @entity62 talks me through what we are going to do , explaining the process before he hands me two knives ; one long blade which will slice through the meat in one swoop and another shorter knife to carve out the loin and smaller cuts			1
first we tackle the fat			0
using the small knife , @entity62 shows me how to pull away the lard			1
nothing we cut today will be wasted – he is a firm proponent of nose - to - tail eating ; the lard can be used as dripping or to make roast potatoes			0
once the fat has been cleared , i have to pull out the tenderloin – a cut of meat that runs on the inside of the spinal column of the pig			1
@entity62 shows me what to do and watches closely as i slice through the meat			1
the knife is sharp and does quick work of this , gliding through it like butter , before i dig in deep and pull the meat away from the bone with my fingers			2
the next step is to cut the flank off the ham ( the leg of the pig )			2
my aim is to get a long a belly as possible			0
i only use a knife to do this – not an axe or a saw as many butchers do - as @entity62 does things the old - fashioned way , using traditional techniques he learnt from a butcher			1
using the animal ’s weight to my advantage , my newly acquired knife skills come to the fore as i hack my way through the bone and then slice around the skin and tendon but not all the way through as i have to separate the leg from the torso by breaking it in one clean move			0
using my previous knife lines as a guide , i position myself at the back end of the pig while @entity62 holds down the front			1
lifting the trotter with my fingers , it ’s astonishingly heavy as i push it towards him			0
in one , swift move i push and with a cracking sound , the leg comes apart cleanly			0
snapping the leg off : after tracing an outline with her knife , the writer had to snap off the leg of the pig @entity168 accomplished ( from left to right ) : spare ribs , belly , tenderloin , ribs and leg next up is to separate the torso of the pig			2
we count down five ribs and this time around i am more confident and slice through cleanly between the fifth and sixth rib			0
the final step is to separate the loin from the belly			0
making two marks on either end of the pig and running the blade of my knife from point a , where i will start , to the end goal , point b , where i will finish			2
this is hard work and @entity62 takes pity on me			1
an accomplished butcher , he would n’t use a saw but as it ’s my first time , he offers me the alternative			2
it ’s a tough job this , tougher than the rest of the tasks			0
the pig is heavy , unyielding and i grapple with its weight			2
the saw slips from my fingers a couple of times but i persevere , brushing aside @entity62 ’s help			1
i want to do this , i want to see it through			0
a primal feeling of joy courses through me as i successfully saw through the spare ribs			0
what i have in front of me now are five sections of the pig , which @entity62 will use in his kitchen for the rest of the week			1
we ’ve cut tenderloin , ribs , spare ribs , belly and a leg , the latter which will be hung and used as ham			0
standing over my work , with a knife stuck into the pig , as if i 've killed it , i feel a deep sense of respect for the animal			0
it ’s a new found appreciation for what i have been thoughtlessly consuming on a daily basis			0
so in answer to the vegetarian 's question - would i be able to butcher an animal for my dinner - my answer is yes			1
what would yours be ? * source : @entity244 2013 @entity246 report			1
