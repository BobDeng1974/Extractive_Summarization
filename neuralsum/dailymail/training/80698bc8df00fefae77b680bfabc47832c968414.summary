by @entity1 reporter published : 12:55 est , 24 november 2013 the family of slain aspiring model and actress @entity4 maintains justice has not been served that once had prosecutors insinuating she was the victim of spurned love and a business deal gone sour			1
dr. @entity9 , who has never been charged in her death , fled the @entity12 two days after the woman accused of brutally slaying 21 - year - old aspiring model and actress @entity4 for pay was arrested			1
now @entity4 ’s family , including her father @entity18 - who cancelled a business deal with @entity20 just five days before his daughter ’s murder - must live with the agonizing knowledge that whoever is responsible for @entity4 's death may never pay			1
this , according to a @entity41 investigation that portrays a sordid tale with few winners other than , perhaps , the @entity32 - @entity12 surgeon			0
@entity45 , 47 , was acquitted in 2013 of charges she viciously attacked @entity47 in her @entity48 , @entity49 in 2008 , bashing in her skull and strangling her so forcefully that a bone was crushed behind her throat			2
prosecutors at the time said alleged @entity56 was carrying out orders from @entity58			2
though her dna was found throughout the crime scene , prosecutors were unable to pin @entity56 to the murder in the eyes of the jury			1
beauty : @entity4 was murdered in her @entity48 apartment in 2008 and dna from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend dr. @entity27 was found all over her home and on her neck while @entity56 now manages a @entity49 restaurant , the man alleged in her trial to have given her a six - figure payment to kill @entity47 remains uncharged			1
friends and family members of the slain model erupted in tears and screams when the jury acquitted @entity56 in june			0
onlookers in the courtroom who knew @entity4 screamed obscenities and called @entity56 a murderer			2
they appeared ready to pounce on @entity56 and were held back by deputies as she turned and was led through a rear entrance			0
whore ! ’ was screamed by a woman in the court			0
‘ somethings wrong here , ’ said a female voice			0
‘ @entity94 bless us all			0
’ jurors had been escorted out a back way before the outburst			0
now there is no one left to pay for @entity47 ’s horrific murder and the man once named in connection to the killing is living thousands of miles and many countries away			0
in @entity56 's trial , ' the prosecution 's motive was that dr @entity27 was in business negotiations with @entity4 's father , ' reporter @entity107 told @entity41			1
' … that motive involved @entity4 's father breaking off business negotiation with him just days before @entity4 's murder			1
' the reknowned surgeon was known to own property across the world including at least one @entity121 home and a horse farm			0
prior to the @entity125 cover girl ’s murder , @entity27 attempted to go into business with miss @entity4 's father , @entity127 , an @entity128 pharmacist			1
however , @entity18 began his own background check into the doctor and discovered that @entity27 was lying about his age , was married and had a family			0
acquitted : @entity45 had been accused on killing model @entity4 with her bare hands in march of 2008			2
the jury in her 2013 trial was unable to convict her on learning of @entity27 's history -- and that he was and continues to be a married man -- @entity4 ended their affair and her father also stopped the business venture he planned with @entity27			1
@entity18 sent @entity27 a letter on march 10 ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed			0
prosecutors said that @entity27 made six - figure payments to @entity56 and her family before the killing and before @entity56 's arrest			2
they said he had also bragged that he had a ' female @entity153 ' ready to act			2
it took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators linked @entity56 through dna evidence found on @entity4 's neck			1
unproven : prosecutors said dr @entity27 ( left ) had hired @entity45 ( right ) to kill @entity4 after a business deal with her father went sour			1
now , @entity56 works as a restaurant manager in @entity49 and @entity27 is living out his life in @entity31 , @entity32 it took seven days for the jury to come to their decision in @entity56 ’s case			1
it will take a lifetime for the @entity4 family and for @entity4 ’s friends to come to grips with the circumstances of her death			0
the family declined to comment much on the case to @entity41 , and sent only a written statement in response to their interview requests : ‘ our family is deeply saddened and shocked … we believe the evidence against the defendant is enormous and that justice has not been served			0

@entity4 , 21 , was found brutally murdered in her @entity48 home in 2008
prosecutors at the time alleged her ex-boyfriend dr. @entity27 , a spurned business partner of her pharmacist father , hired a ' hit woman ' to kill her
@entity45 , who dr. @entity27 once called his person ' female @entity153 , ' was found *innocent* despite her dna having been found all over the crime scene and on @entity4 's strangled neck
@entity27 was never charged in the case and has been living a new life with his wife in @entity31
