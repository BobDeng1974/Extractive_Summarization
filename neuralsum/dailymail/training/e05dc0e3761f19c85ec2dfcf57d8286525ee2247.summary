' @entity99 was identified through video taken by bystanders at the scene on their cell phones			0
tragic : ms @entity9 's husband led the pallbearers into the church and later into the crematorium thought - provoking : ms @entity9 had previously blogged about ways to enjoy your 20s by avoiding self - doubt @entity99 's attorney , @entity127 , told reporters after his client 's arraignment that she was knocked down during the scramble , and he doubted reports that it was a beat - down			1
' i refuse to believe that people of this community would watch a woman stomped to death by five people and nobody would do anything , ' @entity127 said			0
the lawyer characterized it as ' a melee , a bunch of people fighting			0

@entity99 lost her phone in the brawl , and it was recovered later by police , according to @entity127 , who said she is ' devastated ' by the violence			0

' violent police say a fight broke out between @entity1 and another woman , whose friends then stepped in brutal : a video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on @entity250			1
it shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground the fight that ended with @entity257 has drawn national attention as a short video circulated online showing a group of people in nightclub attire wrestling and kicking a figure on the ground in front of a crowd of about 50 people			1
in the video , one person is visible crouching to take another cellphone video			0
a bouncer from the club appears to try to intervene , well after the violence began			2
her family was shocked that ms @entity9 would have been involved in a brawl , making it even more likely that it was an unintentional slight that prompted the altercation			1
‘ she would go out of her way to help others and never expect anything back from them ’ , her stepsister @entity281 told the @entity157			0
‘ that ’s the kind of person she is			0
’ ms @entity9 wrote an uplifting post on her personal blog that was later published on @entity289 before her death , titled ‘ these are the 7 @entity292 ’			1
in the post , she called on people her age to stop being fearful			0
on the ‘ @entity296 ’ , a rationale she said was ‘ empty ’ , she wrote : ‘ we all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when we choose to do another			0
plea : posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic january incident ‘ we may even choose to justify it by announcing it on @entity250 or @entity306 to receive likes and lighthearted comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “ out studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm			0
” do n’t be a fool			0
attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you			0
’ she tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘ not being invited to the party ’ , instead claiming that it is merely the universe ’s way of ‘ telling you that you ’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your time ’			0
on the scourge of social media , in the third part of her missive , ‘ fear that we do n’t compare ’ , she wrote that spending hours stalking people online is pointless			0
‘ we are taught that with photos , we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is often highlighted			0
as for your own life , do n’t forget that sometimes the most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional			0
the elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on social media is quite unnecessary			0
’ she explained that in ‘ @entity343 , or what the @entity344 ’ : ‘ the greatest harm we can do to ourselves is to not take the chance ’			0
other ‘ fears ’ she addresses include ‘ @entity349 ’ , ‘ @entity350 ’ and ‘ @entity351 ’ ‘ perhaps in our generation of self - promotion , egos yield a delicate tiptoe around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed , ’ she concludes			0
‘ however , we need to recognize that this fear should not paralyze us from feeling , living and loving			0
‘ if you are forthright in your own heart ’s honest intent to love , you have nothing to worry about			0
be bold , go forward , and love like hell			0
