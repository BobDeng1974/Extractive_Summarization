by @entity0 she was the @entity1 poker princess who hobnobbed with celebrities and raked in up to $ 4million a year before an encounter with the @entity4 and an @entity6 sting brought her world crashing down			1
glamorous : @entity8 , now 36 , enjoyed a lavish lifestyle funded by hosting high stakes poker games but despite her losses , @entity8 , now 36 , says wants to move on from the experience and hopes to one day mentor up - and - coming female entrepreneurs			1
@entity16 and pretty with a curtain of glossy dark hair and a slender figure , @entity8 looks more @entity1 star than convicted criminal			1
perhaps it was that that made her a favourite with a-list clients , among them @entity26 and @entity27 , although as @entity8 explains , some had a dark side			1
' when @entity26 walked in the first time , all i saw was @entity32 from @entity33 and my voice caught in my throat , ' she remembers			1
' he smiled and handed me a stack of cash that totalled $ 10,000			1
each player did the same			2
' each player was legendary in his own right			2
he was at the pinnacle of his career and was starring in @entity45			2
' the games , which initially took place in a back room at the infamous @entity51 bar on @entity52 in @entity53 , frequently saw huge amounts of money won and lost on games			2
on that first night in 2004 , @entity8 did nothing more than serve drinks to the players but racked up $ 3,000 in tips which she converted into glamorous designer frockst			1
later , after @entity8 was given control of the games by her boss , who she names only as ' @entity69 ' in her new memoir , play moved to private homes and luxury @entity53 hotels such as the @entity74 where huge stakes of up to a quarter of a million dollars were wagered on a single hand			1
this , says @entity8 , left her feeling increasingly uneasy			1
' the size of the game in terms of how much money was at stake , the wins and losses was absolutely insane , ' she says			2
poker face : @entity41 was allegedly a great player but a bad loser who tried to humiliate @entity8 ' it definitely made me uncomfortable			1
i did n’t see how these guys could lose this much and still want to play			0
' i also could n’t help but feel a twinge of guilt			0
this was recreation to them but the sums could have changed lives of those less fortunate			0
but i was right there with them , profiting from the egregious wins and losses			2
' and the rewards both personal and financial , were vast			0
' in the beginning i made sure to save just in case it all went belly up , ' she explains			2
' but when i started spending , it was like a drug			0
' growing up , my parents made sure we had what we needed but it was always discount basics			2
all of a sudden i had cash , i had an @entity120 card and i could buy myself whatever i wanted			0
' i shopped on @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 in @entity124			0
i bought a @entity125 , i chartered private planes , i had a staff , a driver and i rented $ 100,000 homes for summers in the @entity131 and in @entity132			2
' it was shallow , but it was fun			0
a lot of my friends were bought these things by their boyfriends but i loved that i did it all by myself			0
' lavish : the £ 245 - a - night @entity140 in @entity53 was the scene of many a high stakes poker game the nicest man in @entity1 : @entity8 has fond memories of @entity27 and says he is the ' guy you root for ' she counted some of @entity1 's starriest names among her friends , among them @entity27			1
' @entity27 was very nice , polite , smart , and funny , ' she reveals			1
' he ’s someone you root for			0
he ’s nice to everyone			0
' @entity41 , by contrast , was not			1
then 32 , the actor , although initially friendly , soon began to humiliate @entity8 , asking her to ' bark like a seal ' for chips and reacting angrily when she refused			1
' i 'm not kidding , ' he allegedly said to her			0
' what 's wrong ? you ’re too rich now ? you wo n’t bark for a thousand dollars ? ' the gambling goddess said that she refused to stoop to the level of barking , but says in return , ' he gave me an icy look , dropped the chip on the table and tried to laugh it off but he was visibly angry			2
' ' in the beginning he was very nice to me , ' she adds			0
' i felt like he respected me and wanted to help me			0
' i guess at that time he saw we had a mutual interest : more games , more players , bigger stakes , more frequency and so on			2
we were both profiting in a big way			2
' as i started learning how things work , playing to the needs of the entire game as opposed to just his , and making more and more money , his attitude and the way he treated me changed			2
high stakes : @entity8 's lavish lifestyle ended in a conviction , a year on probation and a $ 125,000 fine ' i guess it was then that i realised the game was n’t recreation for rich guys , it was big business and most people were n’t friends with each other			1
' they showed up to take each other ’s money			0
i ca n’t say my feelings were n’t hurt , but i tried hard to not take it personally and to see it for what it was			0
' but @entity41 's enmity cost her more than her dignity			1
it also resulted in the end of her @entity1 poker career , with @entity8 eventually conceding the field and moving to @entity220			1
already raking in up to $ 50,000 a night , the poker business had become too lucrative to give up and so , the games continued with a new group of super-rich clients in the @entity225			1
there , the stakes were even higher with hands of up to $ 4million played by the wealthy bankers , financiers and traders who flocked to her games			1
and @entity8 needed the money			1
spending had become ' like a drug ' to her with lavish shopping sprees , private planes and $ 100,000 holidays all part of her poker - funded lifestyle			1
but the end of @entity8 's lavish existence was in sight			1
visits from the @entity4 , who wanted a slice of her lucrative trade , and the trial of a disgraced former player who had been running a @entity250 , put her on the @entity6 's radar			1
@entity33 wins : @entity26 was a regular player in @entity8 's circle , which had a buy - in of up to $ 100,000 memoir : @entity8 has now written a memoir lifting the lid on the shady side of @entity1 in march 2011 , 20 @entity6 agents invaded a game although @entity8 , then visiting family in @entity262 , was n't there			1
instead , they seized her assets , with @entity8 horrified to find her bank account suddenly $ 9,99999 in the red			1
' it was terrible , terrifying and one of those moments when you realise nothing will ever be the same , ' she says			0
' i realised it was about to get really tough			0
' the @entity6 had wanted to talk to her about her involvement with organised crime but soon let her go after her lawyer successfully argued her innocence			0
but just two years later , in april 2013 , @entity8 was arrested and charged with profiting from hosting illegal poker games			1
' it always felt i was operating in a grey area but i did my best for the majority of the time to stay above board , ' she admits			0
' but i did cross the line			0
' during the first seven years they were completely legal			0
after i moved to @entity220 , i was doing many more games and it was harder to control			1
' i was getting stiffed by people who were n’t paying their debts so i started taking a rake [ a small percentage of each pot ] as an insurance policy			0
' i made a decision to go ahead with the rake , and i regret it everyday			2
' although she initially pleaded not guilty , @entity8 changed her plea in december 2013 and was fined $ 125,000 and sentenced to a year 's probation in may			1
she has , she says , learned her lesson and is now concentrating on moving forward , with her memoir , @entity299 : @entity300 , @entity1 's @entity301 , @entity302 , my life in the @entity304 , the first step			1
' i learned a lot of lessons both good and bad , ' she says			0
' i learned how to be an entrepreneur , and build a business			0
i learned how to make it in a man ’s world			0
i feel it ’s a hard world for girls			0
' next up , she says , is finding a way to get involved with coaching female would - be entrepreneurs , encouraging them to stop taking selfies and use their brains			0
' i would also like to raise a fund and build a board of advisors to get behind female entrepreneurs , ' she adds			0
' and , i definitely want to have a family			0
' from high stakes poker to stay - at - home mother ? stranger things have happened in the mad world of @entity8			1
