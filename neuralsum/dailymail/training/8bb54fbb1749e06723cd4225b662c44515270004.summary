there was a time , in the weeks that followed @entity3 's crunching tackle on @entity4 at @entity5 in march , when the @entity7 midfielder got really worried			1
he had broken a bone in his foot and @entity12 head coach @entity11 was just weeks away from announcing his squad for this summer 's @entity14 in @entity15			1
' unfortunately i have been in that position a lot , ' admitted @entity4 , reflecting on his bad break during @entity12 v @entity21 , as he rested between tuesday 's double training session at @entity23			1
eyes on the ball : @entity4 is looking forward to his first @entity14 club class : @entity4 says that @entity27 helped him by telling him to relex come in no 7 : @entity4 has been given the iconic @entity12 shirt ( left ) worn by @entity29 and @entity30 after @entity31 ( top ) , @entity33 ( middle ) and @entity35 ( bottom ) had first pick it was then that @entity7 manager @entity27 came to his rescue , telling him to relax , be patient and he would go to the @entity14			1
' i spoke to him because i came back into training and i was panicking a bit about the squad , ' revealed @entity4			1
' i wanted to be in it			0
i went to him and said , “ i think i 'm ready ” , and he said , “ no , you 're not , you need to train if you are going to have a good @entity14 ”			2
i knew i would be fit , but it was just down to whether the manager thought i was ready and whether i felt ready myself as well			0
' i knew as well that a bone would take six weeks ( to heal )			0
i thought i would be here , but it is down to the manager and i have to thank him for that			0
' feel the pain : @entity4 goes down under the challenge of @entity3 earlier in the season end of the world : @entity58 lies in pain on the @entity5 turf after the tackle @entity4 has a chequered history when it comes to injuries and has suffered in the past from sometimes playing too much , too soon			1
@entity66 injured his ankle in october and was out for five weeks before returning for the festive fixtures			0
he managed only three games before tweaking a hamstring and missing another month			0
@entity71 missing the whole of the 2011 - 12 season with ankle and knee problems , @entity4 returned in october and made 28 appearances before injuring his ankle in march and sitting out another five weeks			1
@entity77 broke his foot playing for @entity12 in march and spent nine weeks on the sidelines			1
despite missing key games against @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity27 eased @entity4 back into the side — the midfielder made just two substitute appearances at the end of the season			1
52.9 % since coming back from his loan spell at @entity89 in 2010 , @entity4 has only been able to play in just over half of @entity7 ’s games			1
454 days that @entity4 spent out after injuring his ankle in 2011			2
he missed a total of 66 games for @entity7			2
so it was @entity27 , a @entity95 who has no specific responsibility for the welfare of the national team , who saved @entity4 's @entity14 dream			1
it is quite a gesture by @entity7 's manager			1
@entity4 returned to the @entity7 side towards the end of the season , coming off the bench to play a part in their remarkable comeback in the @entity110 final against @entity111			1
' it 's nice to get the first one ( medal ) , ' he admitted			0
as a kid growing up in @entity116 he visualised another trophy , one with even more significance than the @entity110			0
' when i was a youngster ... you want to be part of that , you can only imagine what it would mean to the fans back home if we won the @entity14			2
that 's what we will try to do			0
hopefully we can create something special			0
i have thought about it , especially after winning the @entity110 , you saw what that meant to the @entity7 fans			2
' @entity4 's eyes light up when he recalls watching his first @entity14 in 1998 — ' @entity137 's goal ... @entity139 's penalty ' — when @entity12 went out to @entity140 in a shootout			1
he laughs when he is told that @entity142 can not quite recall whether 2006 or 2010 was the first @entity14 he watched			2
' did n't they have a tv ? ' he jokes			0
in a couple of weeks , when the @entity12 circus arrives en masse in @entity15 , a nation will watch them try to progress through the group phase			2
taking sides : @entity4 puts on his bib during @entity12 training heading to @entity15 : @entity4 will be part the @entity12 squad hoping to do well at the @entity14 ' the young players are not used to being disappointed coming home from a @entity14 so we do n't know what to expect , ' he added			1
' we 're just going over there wanting to do well			0
we also have the likes of @entity35 and @entity33 , who have been there three or four times			1
' @entity35 and @entity33 are the main men around the squad , two players with senior status and the privileges that go with it			1
@entity4 was sitting on a sun lounger at @entity12 's training camp in @entity171 last week when his phone alerted him to a text message			1
magic memories : @entity4 remembers @entity137 's goal for @entity12 against @entity140 sad times : @entity139 missed a penalty in the shot out as @entity12 were knocked in 1998 ' i did n't ask for it , but a text came through saying i was no 7 ( he wears 10 for @entity7 )			1
' i 'll have to get new boots with my number - @entity31 wants 10 , @entity35 four , @entity33 eight			1
the senior players pick the numbers and we get the rest			0
so i have no 7			0
@entity30 , @entity29 wore it , so it is nice to get that number			0
@entity29 was my hero growing up as well so it is quite nice			0
' this summer it will be the turn of the new breed to make an impact as @entity12 prepare to play @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 in their opening three group games			2
listening to the boss : @entity11 speaks to @entity4 and the rest of the @entity12 squad @entity4 has only won 15 caps because of his recurring injury problems , but @entity11 remains a huge fan of the midfielder 's technical @entity205 he prefers to play in 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , ' as we do at @entity7 ' , @entity4 is realistic enough to know that he is simply fighting for a place in @entity12 's midfield with @entity210 and @entity211			1
@entity12 's head coach is demanding that little bit more from his players now , pushing them as they prepare for friday 's friendly with @entity215 at @entity5			2
' he can lose it ( with the players ) a little bit , but if someone is n't doing it he has every right to do that , ' he added			0
there will also come a time when the team prepare for the possibility of a penalty shootout and @entity4 will be one of the first to put up his hand			2
' i read that the boss ( @entity27 ) said i 'm not a penalty taker			2
cheers boss ! it 's strange actually because we did penalties before and i scored mine			0
maybe he just thinks @entity239 people ca n't take penalties			0
but we have some good penalty takers here			0
@entity242 is great at penalties , @entity35 is great at penalties			0
' i took one at @entity246 away in the @entity247			0
i know that is a bit different to playing in @entity15 at a @entity14 , but i scored and i 'd be happy to take one			1
