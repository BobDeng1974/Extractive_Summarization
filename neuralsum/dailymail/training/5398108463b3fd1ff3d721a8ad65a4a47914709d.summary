@entity2 stood stoically with his family in @entity87 's cramped cell and peered across the lime quarry where @entity87 toiled each day , causing the damage to his lungs that led to his latest hospital stint			1
he was flanked by a diverse array of students , underscoring @entity87 's vision for a unified ' rainbow nation ' for the country once led by a white racist government			1
' @entity87 showed us that one man 's courage can move the world , ' @entity2 said during his evening speech at the university			2
challenging @entity108 youth to seize a ' moment of great promise ' , @entity2 declared that the future of the young and growing continent still rests in ailing @entity108 leader @entity87 's vision for equality and opportunity			2
inspiration : @entity2 delivers a speech on @entity14 - @entity108 relations and the younger generation at the @entity82 and spoke of @entity87 's enduring influence on the world making friends : @entity2 greets members of the audience after delivering @entity108 policy remarks at the @entity82 seeking to carve out his own piece of that legacy , @entity2 unveiled an ambitious initiative to double electricity access in @entity130 , vowing to bring ' light where there is darkness '			2

the apartheid regime crumbled under intense internal and external pressure			0
@entity87 was elected as his country 's first black president following his release from prison			1

the @entity224 did not set a specific deadline for achieving that goal , but @entity2 advisers said it could happen within a decade			0

in keeping with the family 's wishes , @entity2 did not visit @entity87 in the hospital			0
on a sunny winter day in the @entity262 , @entity2 and his family flew by helicopter to @entity86 , the prison that epitomized the struggle of @entity87 and his contemporaries against apartheid rule			0
the @entity238 were led through the island by @entity181 , an 83 - year - old former prisoner who was held alongside @entity87 and had also given @entity2 a tour of the jail when he visited as a @entity14 senator in 2006			0
the @entity238 solemnly peered across the bright white lime quarry where @entity87 worked each day			0

before closing their visit , @entity2 and wife @entity278 stoically entered a prison courtyard , the president 's hand on the small of the first lady 's back , to sign a guestbook			1
