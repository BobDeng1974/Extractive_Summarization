in the hour after the bust , total internet trafffic around the world fell by two to three per cent - an indication of the scale of @entity108 , which hosted 34 per cent of file - sharing , according to analyst @entity119			0

@entity110 was denied bail last month when prosecutor @entity147 argued at the bail hearing that @entity110 , also known as @entity110 , was a flight risk ' at the extreme end of the scale ' because it was believed he had access to funds , had multiple identities and had a history of fleeing criminal charges			2
