some drivers were stuck for as long as eight hours on the @entity11 between junctions 25 and 27 between @entity13 and @entity14 in @entity15 after a sudden deluge of snow			1
but as the footage shows , not everyone was willing to sit tight and wait for driving conditions to improve			1
the motorway ground to a halt at around 8.30pm on friday night after light sleet turned into a heavy snow drift which brought more than a foot of snow			1
some drivers helped other motorists , while others took the time to have friendly snowball fights or build snowmen on the carriageway			1
but as the footage shows other people were a little bit more desperate to get to their final destination			1
eye witnesses reported that a number of vehicles tried to drive around the blocked traffic using the hard shoulder but ended up crashing in the bad weather causing further tailbacks			1
other drivers said that some drivers were so desperate to move that their cars were sliding from side to side , colliding with other vehicles			2

' eventually a snow plough drove along the hard shoulder at about 1am , then we saw nothing moving until a police car at 1.40am			1
