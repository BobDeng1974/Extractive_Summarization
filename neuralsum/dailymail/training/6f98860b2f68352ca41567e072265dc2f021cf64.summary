@entity0 of the bees : environment secretary @entity2 urges @entity3 to stop mowing their lawns it is a chore many could do without			1
and now we have @entity8 backing not to bother mowing the lawn – because it will help bees			1
environment secretary @entity2 will today sanction a nation of messier lawns for the benefit of our dwindling bee population			1
making her first major speech since she was given the cabinet position in the summer , the @entity16 politician will say that bees benefit from the wildflowers allowed to grow free			1
‘ people can help pollinators in their garden at home or the local park or school space , ’ she will tell an audience at the @entity22 think tank			0
‘ @entity31 daisies , lavender , primroses , cyclamen , they are just a few of the common flowers that are bee - friendly			0
‘ i have to confess that not mowing your lawn so often is one piece of advice that i have no problem following			1
’ the number of wild bees in @entity44 are thought to have halved in the last 25 years , and other pollinating insects such as butterflies and moths are also struggling			1
miss @entity2 will highlight insects ’ role in agriculture , where they play a vital role in pollinating crops			1
she will say : ‘ without those insects , not only would our parks , gardens and countryside be much more drab places , our food could well become less varied and some of it more expensive			0
’ the loss of the nectar insects feed on is partly to blame for their decline , with 97 per cent of our meadows and their carpets of wildflowers having disappeared since the 1930s			2
the new @entity69 , published today , encourages farmers to cultivate strips of land for wildflowers			2
and schools , businesses and local authorities are asked to plant nectar - rich plants on their land			0
but householders are also asked to do their bit , by allowing a patch of land to grow wild , selecting bee - friendly plants , or simply allowing part of their lawn to grow go un-mown			2
experts advise that lawns not be cut after september to protect bumble bee nests in the grass			1
it also allows caterpillars nesting in the ground to survive until spring			0
by not mowing lawns and allowing wildflowers to grow , @entity44 can help the dwindling bee population those who have space could even allow parts of their lawn to grow wild year - round , the strategy says			1
a recent project conducted by at two sites owned by @entity103 found that cutting the grass less often and instead sowing wild flower seed boosted bee numbers by 37 per cent			1
miss @entity2 will also call for a new debate over the environment , which until now been a polarised ‘ slanging match ’ between ‘ hippies and gas - guzzlers ’			1
defending the @entity112 ’s environmental record , she will insist that she and her colleagues are still committed to their pledge to be the ‘ greenest government ever ’			0
she will say : ‘ to achieve that , the debate has to get beyond experts and special interest groups , beyond targets and summits , beyond the polarised slanging match we so often hear : you ’re an alarmist or a denier , a hippy or a gas - guzzler			0
‘ the reality is different			0
we are making environmental and economic progress			0
they are not just compatible - they depend on each other			0
’ bee a friend : bees play a vital role in pollinating crops , but the number of wild insects is thought to have halved in the last 25 years she will also call for a new approach to the environment , with fewer restrictions and greater enjoyment			1
‘ ever since can remember , the environment has been presented as something worthy			2
‘ it ’s been all about behaving yourself : sort out your rubbish or else ; feel guilty about buying more stuff ; take fewer flights			0
‘ it ’s all been about having less but it can – and should – be about having more			0
‘ a clean , beautiful , healthy natural environment is about more jobs and greater prosperity , contributing to our long - term economic plan , our wellbeing and our future security			2
’ @entity159 groups last night praised the minister ’s rhetoric , but said she needs to match it with action			0
@entity164 , head of campaigns at @entity166 , said : ‘ this action plan is an important step towards safeguarding @entity44 ’s bees and other pollinators - but unless it properly tackles the impact of pesticides and helps all farmers to develop bee - friendly practices its effectiveness will be significantly undermined			1
‘ tens of thousands of people have backed @entity166 ’s @entity180 campaign for a national action plan			0
they will expect a robust strategy capable of saving our bees			2
‘ bees are crucial pollinators for our farms , gardens and countryside – failure to protect them from every threat they face will have a costly impact on us all			2
