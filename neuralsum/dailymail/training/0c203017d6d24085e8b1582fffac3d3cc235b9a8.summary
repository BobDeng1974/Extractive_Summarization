up to 13,000 people in @entity3 are being held in conditions of slavery , four times the number previously thought , the @entity0 has said			1
in what is said to be the first scientific estimate of the scale of modern slavery in the @entity3 , the @entity0 has said the number of victims last year was between 10,000 and 13,000			1
they include women forced into prostitution , domestic staff and workers in fields , factories and fishing boats			1
launching the government 's modern slavery strategy , home secretary @entity20 said the scale of abuse was ' shocking '			1
' the first step to eradicating the scourge of modern slavery is acknowledging and confronting its existence , ' she said			0
' the estimated scale of the problem in modern @entity3 is shocking and these new figures starkly reinforce the case for urgent action			1
' the new estimate is based on a statistical analysis by the @entity0 chief scientific adviser , professor @entity43 , which aims for the first time to calculate the ' dark figure ' of victim numbers who are not reported to the law enforcement agencies			1
' modern slavery is very often deeply hidden and so it is a great challenge to assess its scale , ' he said			1
' the data collected is inevitably incomplete and , in addition , has to be very carefully handled because of its sensitivity			0
' the new strategy document , which builds on the frameworks used to counter terrorism and fight organised crime , sets out plans for co-ordinated action across government and law enforcement agencies to run alongside the @entity63 currently going through @entity64			0
@entity66 's shadow home office minister @entity65 , pictured , said an anti-slavery bill currently going through @entity64 needed ' strengthening ' , while victims needed far more support from the state while many victims are foreign nationals , the document emphasises that vulnerable @entity3 adults and children are also being systematically preyed upon by traffickers and slave drivers			2
the @entity25 estimates that the @entity3 was the third most common country of origin for victims identified in 2013			1
among overseas victims , many of them brought into the @entity3 by people traffickers , the most common countries were @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
as part of the strategy the national policing lead for modern slavery , @entity92 and @entity94 chief constable @entity93 , has been designated to draw up a new national action plan to ensure police forces across the country work together effectively in tackling the issue			2
in her foreword to the document , mrs may said : ' young girls are raped , beaten , passed from abuser to abuser and sexually exploited for profit			0
vulnerable men are tricked into long hours of hard labour before being locked away in cold sheds or run - down caravans			0
' women are forced into prostitution , and children systematically exploited			1
domestic workers are imprisoned and made to work all hours of the day and night for little or no pay			2
' we must put a stop to these crimes , and stamp out modern slavery			0
@entity119 , the director of the charity @entity120 , warned that policing measures alone would not resolve the issue			0
he said that protection of victims needed to be placed on a statutory footing in order to reassure those who came forward that they would not themselves be treated as criminals or face deportation			2
' it is something that the government seems loath to consider because it is confusing this debate with the migration one and that is a poisonous conflict at the moment , ' he told the @entity139 4 today programme			0
' for many of the victims of trafficking , the police are n't somebody that they would necessarily assume are going to be their friends because of their backgrounds and where they are coming from			2
' for @entity66 , shadow home office minister @entity65 said the figures underlined the need to strengthen the bill going through @entity64			2
' there must be much more support for victims of human trafficking and slavery			0
this was the biggest gap in the government 's bill , ' she said			0
' the government must reverse their decision to tie those people who come here on a domestic worker 's visa to their employer - this makes it much harder for those facing abuse and not being paid to report this and leave			0

the shocking figures include women trafficked for prostitution or *service*
others are brought in to work in factories , fields or even fishing boats
the @entity0 confirmed it *underestimated* the scale of the problem
the most common victims are from @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87
