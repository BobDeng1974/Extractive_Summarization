embarrassing footage has emerged of a missile launch going spectacularly wrong in @entity2			1
the minute - long clip shows the @entity5 rocket barely managing to take off before plummeting back down to earth			1

lift off : the rocket just about launches with debris and a plume of smoke clearly visible next to the @entity2 flag up and down : the @entity5 rocket barely manages to take off before it starts plummeting back down to earth it scarcely gets off the launchpad and is followed by a small plume of smoke , before it can be seen dropping out of the sky as shouts can be heard from those watching			1
seconds later , the rocket goes out of view as whoever is filming takes cover and a huge explosion can be heard			1
the shaky camera returns to a massive plume of smoke			0
the leaked footage will be of some embarrassment to @entity39 who as grown the @entity2 defence budget has grown by 33 per cent to Â£ 54billion over the past year			2
it comes not long after shocking footage emerged of failed another rocket launch which killed six @entity2 ballistic missile technicians			1
bang : a loud explosion can be heard before plumes of smoke are clearly visible following the failed launch of a rocket in @entity2 footage of the accident , which happened several months ago but officials tried to keep quiet , was posted on social network sites			2
it happened near @entity55 in the @entity56 where it is believed the missile was about to be fired against government forces			0
a second @entity61 missile was successfully launched a few seconds later from the wreckage , but there is nothing left of the launch site controlled by @entity2 backed militia			0
it shows a deafening explosion in a field with plumes of white smoke rising quickly into the atmosphere			0
a second missile , which would also have been programmed , is still launched from the wreckage a few seconds later , presumably heading towards its intended target .			0
