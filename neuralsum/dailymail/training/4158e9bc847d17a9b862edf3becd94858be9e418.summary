by @entity0 last updated at 3:45 pm on 16th august 2011 socialite : @entity1 helped break up a black - market baby selling ring after she paid $ 180,000 for her son a black - market baby - selling ring that charged at least $ 100,000 per child was broken up by the @entity6 - with the help of a socialite who had been tricked into buying her son			1
@entity1 , daughter of rock music promoter @entity9 , unwittingly became involved in the sting where cash - strapped surrogates were impregnated with sperm and eggs from the @entity14			1
as she was about to receive her child , for whom she had paid $ 180,000 , she was contacted by @entity6 investigators who asked her to record her conversations with the three ringleaders			1
a trio of baby - sellers have since pleaded guilty to wire - fraud charges and @entity1 now wants to change the law so adopted children have the right to know the identity of their parents			1
she said : ' looking back , there are signs i should have seen			2
but i did n't , i just did n't			2
' single - mother @entity1 , who lives in @entity30 , decided to adopt a brother for @entity32 , her four - year - old daughter with @entity34 billionaire @entity33 , in 2009			1
but the process became complicated and so when a lawyer , who was a friend of a friend , told her about a baby whose planned adoptive parents had walked away and was now available , she agreed to become its mother			2
she never received the child as the agency , which targeted wealthy couples over the internet , said in september 2009 that the surrogate had run away			1
@entity1 told the @entity46 : ' they told me she was a crackhead			1
a vegan , and she wanted to give birth with a doula [ labour coach ]			1
' in fact , she was already onto the agency and [ ultimately ] was the first person to contact the @entity6			2
[ @entity56 ] is the heroine in all this			2
' tricked : the scam , which saw at least 12 babies sold , worked for six years within two weeks @entity1 was contacted by lawyer @entity60 who told her another baby was now available as the intended parents of a @entity64 child had backed out of the deal			1
although she thought it was ' weird ' that she was not allowed to contact the surrogate , despite prospective parents usually encouraged to cultivate a relationship , she started wiring payments to the agency			0
she received profiles of the supposed surrogate parents , who had blond hair and blue eyes , with their dates of birth and families ' medical histories			0
but the information was all fake			0
the truth of where the babies were coming from was much more seedy			0
prospective surrogate mothers were offered between $ 38,000 and $ 45,000 for their services			0
they were then taken to @entity14 , where the population is overwhelming white and medical checks are not as stringent , to be implanted with fertilised eggs from anonymous donors			0
once the surrogate was 12 weeks pregnant a buyer was lined up and the pregnant mothers were then taken to @entity93 to give birth because it is one of the few states that lets the name of a non-biological parent to be put onto the birth certificate easily			0
the scam , which saw at least 12 babies sold , worked for six years			0
@entity60 , 32 ; surrogacy lawyer @entity101 , 43 ; and former surrogate @entity102 , 51 , all pleaded guilty to wire - fraud charges and will be sentenced in october			1
once the trio had been caught , @entity1 made sure the surrogate mother was paid $ 26,000 and @entity106 paid her back the remaining $ 154,000			1
she has now formally adopted five - month - old @entity107 , who was born in march 2011			2
@entity1 is now working on a documentary called ' @entity109 , @entity108 - the @entity110 ' about the transparency of donors			1
she said : ' my son has no information about the identity of his real parents , and i think that is a birth right			0
' i want to go to the @entity14 to track down my son 's donors so that he has some idea of his dna , and change some laws in @entity125 so that all adopted children have the right to find out the identity of their true parents			0
' i want to make a change so my son does n't feel the victim out of this			0
he 's a game changer			0
hopefully , after his story , everything will be different			0
