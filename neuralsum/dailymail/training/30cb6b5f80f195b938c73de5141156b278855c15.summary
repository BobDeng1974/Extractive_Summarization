' if there is a record of that i do n't see any reason not to take it seriously			0
' there is a risk that patient 's care is being affected by the people in the building , but then why should we expect ambulance staff to put themselves at risk ? patients are advised to wait outside the house of a blacklisted house ' if there are 200 addresses in @entity66 then it does n't sound like it is a widespread problem			1
' the ambulance staff take a lot of chances for us generally and i do n't see any reason not to believe them if they say there is a problem			2
