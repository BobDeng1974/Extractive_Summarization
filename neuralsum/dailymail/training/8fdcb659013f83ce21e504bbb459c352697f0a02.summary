by @entity0 a @entity2 matriarch was so determined to protect her family from @entity5 persecution , she hid herself and them in an underground cave until their country was liberated - eighteen months later			1
@entity10 lived a peaceful , rural existence in a small @entity13 village with her six children until the @entity15 invaded in late 1941			1
hellbent on annihilating the @entity2 people , the soldiers rounded up more than a thousand @entity2 and sent them to their deaths			1
several @entity2 families escaped the @entity22 thanks to the courage of @entity10 , front row , second from left @entity25 , in green , and his brother @entity26 , with yellow kneepads , revisted the cave nearly 70 years later but mrs @entity10 and her husband @entity30 were determined that their innocent family would survive , whatever it took			1
so , she and five other @entity2 families from the area packed up their belongings one cold october night in 1942 and fled , in the dark , to a sinkhole masking the entrance to an underground cave , five miles north of their home in @entity42			1
a new documentary , @entity44 , tells the story of mrs @entity10 's courage more than 70 years ago			1
she and her family had already survived one year of @entity15 occupation , but knew that the shadow of death was creeping ever closer			0
her son @entity25 , now 86 , told @entity51 that the family 's secret was their utter determination never to give in			2
the cave they settled in was pitch black , damp , and lay beneath ground that @entity5 soldiers would march over , deep in the @entity13 countryside			0
@entity25 and @entity26 said that their underground home was ' paradise ' because they were free the six families , with 38 people in total , ended up hiding there for 18 months , until it was safe to go above ground in their own land again			1
during that time , the families lived in complete darkness , digging out toilets and showers and more living space as they concentrated on surviving until they could come out again			2
at night they foraged for food , and in the day time they hid deep in the darkness			0
mr @entity26 's older brother @entity26 , now 92 , said : ' you went to sleep and you had a pillow and you covered up with good blankets - what else you want ? ' @entity26 , his nieces @entity81 and @entity83 , and his brother @entity25 play themselves in the documentary what the family had and prized above anything was their freedom - they had escaped the invading forces , and they would continue to do so for more than 500 days			0
during that time , @entity10 had to defend her family once , when @entity95 soldiers raided the first cave			2
coming face - to - face with the men they had lived in fear of for so long , mrs @entity10 held her ground , despite the fact they were pointing guns at her			1
@entity25 said : ' and she says " what are you afraid of here ? the @entity108 is gon na lose the war because we live here ? " ' @entity26 and @entity25 , seen here in the film , say they would not have survived without their determined mother the soldiers left , never to return , and finally , in april 1944 , the @entity115 liberated the area and the hidden families were able to climb out of the cave into the light			0
last year the @entity10 brothers returned to the cave for the first time , for the film			2
they told how after the war , they travelled to @entity126 and set up a business , which they still run there			0
today the survivors and offspring of those who hid in the @entity13 caves number more than 125 , and the film , which will be on limited release in the @entity136 today and will be released in @entity15 next month , tells the story of their courage			0
their survival is the longest uninterrupted underground survival in recorded human history .			0

@entity10 and @entity142 and their six children lived underground to survive
they were among six @entity2 families who *avoided* being sent to their deaths
their *astonishing* story will be told in new documentary @entity44
