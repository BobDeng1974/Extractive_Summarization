just 260 days from now , hosts @entity1 will launch the 2015 tournament against @entity3 at @entity4			1
the pool match is the first of 48 fixtures in an event that will break a multitude of records and potentially revolutionise the sport in these islands			2
here , @entity13 assesses the prospects of the home country , their nearest rivals , the other leading nations , and the event itself ... @entity1 selection : the back line is still a work in progress and midfield is the primary conundrum , as per usual			1
when — if ever — all the candidates are fit , it is likely to be a simple equation : @entity28 plus another , with several men jostling to claim the no 12 shirt			2
@entity31 is the form option , @entity33 the possible bolter			0
@entity35 deserves to retain the fly - half berth for now , but @entity37 wo n’t quietly settle for the role of understudy			0
depth : @entity1 have a vast array of very good players , but few , if any , who would consistently belong in the world level , elite bracket			1
@entity46 needs his leading lights to make that leap this year , but the head coach knows he could field two test - class packs to take on all comers			0
there are a multitude of pedigree @entity55 loosehead props , locks and flankers , scrum - halves and full - backs , but the coaches would like more tightheads and an out - and - out openside option			0
@entity1 head coach @entity46 will be hoping @entity28 is back to full fitness for the @entity0 @entity33 is expected to play a major role in @entity1 's quest to win the @entity0 momentum : more needed , urgently			1
the national team were unable to claim the results they craved against the southern giants in the autumn , although victory over @entity74 at least laid down a strong marker against a pool rival			1
in the @entity78 , the priority will be a ‘ statement ’ win against another pool a side , @entity82 , to bury the ghosts of the record 30 - 3 defeat in @entity86 two years ago			2
yet , frankly , @entity1 require a title or a @entity88 to give them a timely surge of belief and conviction			1
tactics : @entity1 are still in the development phase , when they need to be fine - tuning			1
an expansion of the game - plan in the 2014 @entity78 brought pace and dynamism to their play , as well as heartening results , but they were unable to beat @entity100 at their own deadly game during the summer			1
in the recent november campaign , the vital success against @entity74 was founded on traditional forward force			1
@entity106 ’s men must acquire the valuable knack of adapting on the hoof			0
preparation : no stone will be left unturned			0
no expense will be spared			0
@entity46 is orchestrating a meticulous @entity0 challenge based on the appliance of science and technology			1
@entity1 have adopted @entity118 ’s ‘ aggregate of marginal gains ’ formula			1
they will spend a fortnight in @entity121 in july and they now have a state - of - the - art training facility on site at their @entity125 hq			0
if they do n’t succeed , it wo n’t be due to a lack of planning			0
@entity82 @entity130 ’s team have phenomenal potential , but not the results to mark them out as front - line @entity0 contenders			1
@entity135 will tell if the recent victory over @entity137 will serve as a launch - pad for @entity140 confidence levels			1
the core of the line - up is well established and armed with crucial experience from the last @entity0 and a glorious @entity145 campaign , while the likes of @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 have made a positive impact			2
@entity147 and @entity151 appear capable of igniting a more high - tempo attacking game but @entity130 must decide if it is right , at this late stage , to move away from the power - runner formula which has served him well — in @entity157 at least			0
one negative is the loss of @entity160 hooker @entity159 , who will undergo surgery on a dislocated shoulder and looks set to miss @entity82 ’ @entity78 campaign			0
@entity82 coach @entity130 must get his tactics right if his side are to mount a serious challenge the contenders no prizes for identifying the favourites			2
@entity100 are top of the world rankings by a street and keep finding ways to win even when they are being emphatically out - played			1
they have vast experience , nous and power , supreme skills and athleticism , and the greatest finisher in the game — @entity182			0
@entity137 have the size and enough quality to be a force and @entity74 will improve rapidly under @entity186			1
the canny @entity187 , @entity188 , has turned @entity189 into @entity157 ’s front - runners and although they have been mostly hopeless in recent years , do n’t rule out a shock charge by @entity192			0
@entity100 will have the greatest finisher in the game , @entity182 , at his disposal the tournament this will be a slick event projected around the world			1
it will surpass all records for attendances , profits and tv ratings , but it must do more than that			0
@entity4 is already a victim of commercial overkill and those trying out the sport must not be submerged under a tide of logos and marketing slogans			2
the tournament needs to have atmosphere and soul , not a sanitised , corporate feel			2
it needs @entity218 nations to have full access to all their top players and it needs a massive logistical operation to ensure transport chaos does not blight the night games in particular			0
make all that happen and it will be a wondrous carnival of rugby			0
@entity4 will be among the 13 stadiums which will play host to the @entity230			2

@entity1 will launch the @entity0 in 2015 at @entity4
@entity100 are favourites to win the tournament in @entity1
@entity137 and @entity74 will also be major contenders
