@entity0 have no plans to bid for @entity2 in january			1
manager @entity3 is aware that the @entity4 is keen on a move away from @entity6 but the 21 - year - old is not high on @entity0 's list of priorities			2
@entity3 will listen to offers for @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 and is prepared to bring in players from his academy ahead of what he anticipates will be a relatively quiet transfer window			0
@entity0 are not planning on making an offer for @entity4 's @entity2 during the transfer window @entity4 forward @entity2 is said to be keen on a move away from the @entity6 new @entity4 manager @entity22 would want in the region of £ 20million for the @entity24 international should substantial bids come in for @entity28 , who is wanted on loan by @entity30 , or @entity31 , they could go too but @entity3 will not necessarily turn to @entity2 with @entity33 's @entity32 and @entity35 's @entity34 also in his thoughts			1
@entity4 manager @entity22 played @entity2 in the @entity39 tie against @entity40 and will assess the @entity41 international over the next few weeks			0
he would want around £ 20million should he decide to sell which would limit the market further for the 21 - year - old			0
@entity4 's club record £ 10m signing @entity47 could also yet be sold			0
@entity0 duo @entity28 and @entity31 could leave @entity48 in january @entity11 ( left ) , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 could also depart the club			1
