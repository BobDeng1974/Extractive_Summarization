by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 08:10 est , 2 april 2013 @entity1 , 52 , died after doctors failed to notice he was not receiving vital drugs a father - of - three died on the bathroom floor of a hospital after a junior doctor left life - saving drugs off his medication chart , an inquest has heard			1
medics failed to realise @entity1 , 52 , was not receiving vital blood - thinning drugs for six days after he underwent brain surgery to remove a benign tumour			1
mr @entity1 did not receive the drugs - designed to reduce the risk of blood clots - because a junior doctor missed them off his treatment chart when she copied it up			1
as a result , a clot formed in mr @entity1 ’s leg , broke free , and blocked an artery , causing a fatal pulmonary embolism - a blood clot in the pulmonary artery - as he walked to the bathroom			1
a post-mortem examination found he had already suffered a smaller embolism which could have alerted doctors to their mistake and saved his life			2
a coroner ruled that doctors and nurses missed numerous opportunities to spot their mistake and said ‘ neglect ’ had been a contributing factor to his death			1
an inquest at @entity41 on friday heard that the keen walker ’s life could probably have been saved if the mistake had been picked up			2
mr @entity1 had surgery to correct a rare tumour in his nasal cavity and skull at @entity49 , in @entity50 , on april 3 last year			1
he initially received the anti-coagulant medication after the opeation but stopped receiving it following the error			2
the contracts manager , from @entity56 , @entity57 , died as he walked to the bathroom on april 22 , almost three weeks after his operation			0
mr @entity1 ’s partner , @entity60 , told the inquest she had ‘ fought for a year ’ to stop the tragedy being ‘ swept under the carpet ’			2
describing the moment she learned of his death , she told the inquest : ‘ the hospital rang me at five in the morning and told me there was an emergency , so i shot up there			0
‘ i thought if he saw i was calm it would help him to keep calm			0
‘ i thought he might have broken his arm or leg , but when i got to the ward they told me he was gone			0
’ consultant neurosurgeon @entity80 admitted the mistake should have been detected sooner			0
he said : ‘ what is serious is that it was not picked up for six days			0
’ mr @entity80 added that when he learned what had happened , he sent an email to the hospital ’s chief executive			0
a junior doctor at @entity49 missed vital blood - thinning drugs off mr @entity1 's medication chart and as a result he went without them for six days and died of a blood clot in the pulmonary artery deputy coroner @entity95 asked him : ‘ on a scale of one to ten , how serious would you say these collective failings were ? ’ he replied : ‘ very serious , ten out of ten			1
‘ that ’s what made me send an email			0
’ the inquest heard the hospital had since improved ward rounds and made other changes to minimise the risk of a similar tragedy			1
ruling that neglect had contributed to mr @entity1 ’s death , ms @entity95 asked the hospital to send her written confirmation that it had implemented measures to prevent similar mistakes occurring again			1
dr @entity114 , deputy medical director , apologised to the family for the ‘ unimaginable distress and grief ’ the hospital had caused them			0
he accepted serious mistakes were made and promised the hospital would continue to improve its procedures .			0
