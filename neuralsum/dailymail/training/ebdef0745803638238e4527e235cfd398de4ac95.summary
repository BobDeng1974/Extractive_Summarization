primary schoolchildren as young as four should attend ‘ savings clubs ’ to teach them how to handle money responsibly , the @entity0 said			1
the proposal aims to prevent them relying on controversial payday lenders or racking up heavy debts later in life			1
under the plans , children would be able to save small , regular amounts of money , and would be given the chance to help to run the groups , working as junior cashiers or ‘ bank managers ’			1
the @entity0 proposal aims to prevent children relying on controversial payday lenders or racking up heavy debts later in life			1
it would see children as young as four attend ' savings clubs ' ( file picture , posed ) parents and school staff could also sign up to the clubs , with mothers and fathers able to set up dedicated accounts to save for particular expenses such as trips and school uniform			1
the proposals – which would be piloted in @entity0 primary schools – have been drawn up by the archbishop of @entity38 's new @entity37 on responsible credit and savings			1
they are now looking for funding from the government and private companies for the pilot scheme , which would run in six schools over nine months before being rolled out further			0
last year , @entity48 @entity47 criticised payday lender @entity50 without realising the @entity0 had indirectly invested £ 75,000 through its investment arm			0
mr @entity47 later acknowledged it was ‘ very embarrassing ’ to learn of the investment and the church announced earlier this year it had severed its ties with the payday lender			0
now , the archbishop hopes the proposals can help people to avoid payday lenders – which charge astronomical interest on short - term loans – by teaching them to be careful with their finances from an early age			0
the @entity0 said it was focusing on savings clubs in primary schools partly because it is responsible for one in four primaries in @entity0 and also because financial education is already part of the national curriculum for secondaries			2
the archbishop , @entity48 @entity47 , hopes it will help people avoid payday lenders by teaching them to be careful with finances from an early age the savings clubs would be given ‘ seed ’ funding of £ 1 per child per term for the first year for all youngsters who want to join and take part , the @entity0 said			1
sir @entity84 , the former chief executive of the @entity85 and chair of the task group , said : ‘ savings clubs can transform lives through helping establish a responsible approach to money from an early age			2
’ the @entity0 wants the savings clubs to be hosted by credit unions , small financial co-operatives set up by local communities and other groups such as trade unions			1
because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit , credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties			0
a report yesterday said savings clubs in schools can be a good way to improve children 's financial knowledge			2
@entity113 said research found nearly two - thirds of children get their first bank or building society account before they start secondary school , while nearly three - quarters of 15 - year - olds with a bank account have a debit card			0
the charity said : ‘ with children making financial choices at an even younger age , and regularly exposed to advertisements for credit , it has never been so important to ensure that children learn about debt and money management from an early age			0
’ the @entity0 said four years old was not too young to attend savings club because ‘ many young children have piggy banks ’			2
they added : ‘ it is entirely optional both for children and schools			0
‘ at that very young age , they ca n’t help run the banks , but can bring in pennies to deposit			0
