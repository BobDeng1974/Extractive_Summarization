like many an expectant mother , @entity0 went for her 12 - week pregnancy scan full of excitement at seeing her unborn baby			1
and despite the scan and a subsequent blood test revealing the baby had a one in 90 chance of having @entity10 ’s syndrome , she refused to become despondent			1
she says she was offered the prospect of an abortion if another test confirmed doctors ’ fears – but instead trusted in her ‘ instinct ’ that the baby would be fine			1
mrs @entity0 , 33 , of @entity30 , said : ‘ it was a very worrying time when we were told @entity22 was at high risk of being born with @entity10 ’s syndrome but it goes to show that sometimes doctors can be wrong			1
‘ we had a one in 90 chance of having a @entity10 ’s syndrome baby , which is high risk , but ... tests in pregnancy are n’t always right			1
’ research suggests a woman her age would normally have a one in 1,000 chance of having a @entity10 ’s syndrome baby			1
she said that following @entity22 ’s birth last june doctors confirmed he did not have @entity10 ’s syndrome , and added : ‘ in my mind i knew he was going to be healthy because he was moving all the time ( in the womb ) and i just had an instinct he would be fine			1
’ doctors first became concerned for the @entity51 when she was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum , the extreme form of morning sickness suffered by the @entity55 in both of her pregnancies			0
a fortnight later , she was in hospital for six days when the condition , which is characterised by extreme sickness and nausea , worsened			0
at the 12 - week scan doctors detected excess fluid on the back of the baby ’s neck , which can suggest a possible case of @entity10 ’s syndrome			1
blood tests were ordered and the results also suggested a risk of @entity10 ’s , as high as one in 90			1
the teaching assistant and her partner @entity72 , 34 , an hgv driver , were offered the option of an amniocentesis - a procedure used to obtain a small sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the foetus during pregnancy			2
although the procedure can diagnose @entity10 ’s syndrome , it increases the risk of miscarriage to 1 in 100 , while the risk of developing a serious infection is put at 1 in 1,000			2
early amniocentesis - before the 14th week of pregnancy - has also been linked to increased risk of the baby developing club foot			2
ms @entity0 urged other pregnant women to trust their instincts , claiming she knew @entity22 would be ok mrs @entity0 said she was told an abortion would be an option if she had the test and it came back positive for @entity10 ’s			1
she added : ‘ i had a number of phone calls from staff at the hospital about taking the test			0
i got the impression they were pushing for me to have it but i refused every time			0
‘ they said the procedure would create an increased risk of miscarriage so we decided against it			0
‘ the combination of my illness and the risk of the baby having the disease was why they mentioned an abortion at that stage			2
‘ the doctors said both myself and the baby were at risk but termination was never an option for us			0
’ mrs @entity0 , who also has daughters @entity122 , 13 , and seven - year - old @entity123 from a previous relationship , gave birth naturally to 8lb 9oz @entity22 at @entity126 in @entity127			2
she said the traumatic pregnancy has ‘ made me love @entity22 even more ’			0
dr @entity129 , a consultant in obstetrics and foetal medicine at the @entity132 and @entity133 , said it would be ‘ most unusual ’ for a hospital to advise or offer a termination after only a scan and blood test			0
the @entity139 operates a foetal anomaly screening programme which is open to all expectant mothers in @entity142			0
its policy is to offer an abortion only after a diagnosis for the condition is confirmed by the amniocentesis test			0
dr @entity148 , director of programmes for the @entity149 , said : ‘ the @entity139 @entity150 provides all pregnant women in @entity142 with high quality information and support so they can make an informed choice about screening for @entity10 and a number of physical abnormalities in their unborn baby			2
‘ women are encouraged to carefully consider the benefits and possible harms of screening in light of their own values before making a decision			0
