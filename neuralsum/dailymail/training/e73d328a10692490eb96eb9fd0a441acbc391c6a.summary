raising taxes on the rich has become a rallying cry for progressives in the @entity33 era			2
president @entity33 has made his quest to make @entity2 making more than $ 250,000 a year pay their ' fair share ' in taxes a cornerstone of his presidency			1
@entity33 's ' fair share ' strategy is based on the idea that middle - class @entity2 should n't be paying the same tax rate as ' rich ' @entity2 because it creates an unfair disparity in wealth			1
in his 2014 budget released earlier this month , president @entity33 calls for a minimum 30 percent tax rate on millionaires like the @entity50 and @entity51 as part of a revived effort to institute the @entity54			1
the @entity55 claims that many @entity2 who make $ 1 million or more are paying less than 15 percent in taxes			1
@entity33 wants to double their tax rate			0
' anyone who does well for themselves should do their fair share in return , so that more people have the opportunity to get ahead â€” not just a few , ' the @entity55 's page on the @entity54 explains			0
during his two - hour economic speech on wednesday at @entity6 , his alma mater , @entity0 said he supported president @entity33 's plan to let the @entity68 tax cuts on the rich to expire because people in his income bracket have ' enough disposable income that it did n't change our consumption patterns much			1
' but you cut spending too much or raise taxes too much , it would n't work , @entity0 said			2
' you can only balance a budget if you have adequate revenues , adequate spending restraints and adequate growth			2
the country needs growth , ' @entity0 said			2
' then everybody will do well			0
' ' @entity28 and i , and some of our friends in this audience who live in @entity88 , probably pay the highest aggregate tax rates in @entity2 , and i thank @entity90 every april 15 that i 'm able to do it			2
i never ... the family i grew up in			0
i 'm not ... i 'm thankful , ' @entity0 said , choking up a little , as he recalled his childhood			0
' but you could tax me at a hundred percent , and we could n't bring growth back into the economy enough to balance the budget , ' @entity0 continued			1
' it 's got to be a growth strategy			0
' no federal politician has advocated that the @entity2 should begin confiscating wealthy @entity2 ' income in it 's entirety			1
progressives say they want they want the rich to pay more of their income in taxes , but they have been vague on how tax money they would consider enough			1
