for centuries people in the @entity1 lived in fear of vampires			0
and now a telling sign of the precautionary measures they took against the mythical creatures has been found in northwestern @entity8			1
the grave of the suspected terror was found in @entity11 and has all the markings of a vampire burial			1
the skeleton of a suspected vampire has been found in the town of @entity11 in northwester @entity8			1
the burial is thought to date back to the 16th century , a time when much of central @entity18 was fearful of vampires rising from the dead and ' sucking their blood ' the body is believed to date back to the 16th century , although the absence of personal effects makes it difficult to date			1
it was found during a dig in the cemetery next to the town church			1
its features are reminiscent of similar vampire burials that have been found in the past			2
the most obvious sign of this being a vampire burial was the stake through its leg			1
many suspected vampires are found nailed or staked to the ground to prevent them rising from the ground			1
‘ initially we thought he had suffered a leg wound , ’ dig leader @entity42 told @entity43			2
‘ but from sifting through the earth underneath , we realised there was a hole likely made from a puncture			0
' the mouth was also found without its teeth with a piece of brick in their place , which supposedly stopped the vampire rising and sinking its teeth into victims			1
the mouth of the burial was also found with a small bit of brick rubble in it , which would have been intended to stop the vampire sinking its teeth into people if it did rise from the dead the skeleton was found with a stake through its leg , which would have been intended to stop the vampire rising from the grave , said dig leader @entity42 finding vampire burials like this is not uncommon , with several discovered in @entity8 over the last few years			1
it is thought that burials of this sort were common in the @entity11 area from the 13th to 17th century			2
according to some beliefs , people who were considered bad during their lifetimes might turn into vampires after death unless stabbed in the chest with an iron or wooden rod before being buried			0
these vampires were often intellectuals , aristocrats and clerics			0
upon their death - or even before - locals would take measures to ensure that the suspected vampires did not terrorise their communities by driving stakes through parts of their bodies or removing the teeth from their mouth			1
finding vampire burials is not uncommon , with several discovered in @entity8 over the last few years			1
it is thought that burials of this sort were common in the @entity11 ( marked ) area from the 13th to 17th century the belief in vampires was widespread throughout @entity107 and other parts of central @entity18 throughout the @entity1			2
the word vampire is derived from the original slavic term opyrb or opir which later appears as vipir , vepir , or vapir			0
drunkards , thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires			0
@entity118 prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of a vampire			2
the scene was in 1958 's ' @entity123 ' appearing completely normal , they would arrive at a town and live amongst the people often even marrying and fathering children			0
but at night they would wander the countryside in search of blood			0
these types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart			0
one account maintains that a vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or along a country road , and whose corpse is eaten by crows , wolves , or some other such scavengers			0
because such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the blood of anyone who comes by			0
another account states a person who died a violent , unnatural death or whose corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial , can become a vampire			1
in such cases during the first 40 days after burial , the bones turn to gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night - releasing animals from their pens , scattering house hold items , and suffocating people			2
during the first forty days it can be destroyed by a @entity174 - a professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively devoured by a wolf			0
however if not destroyed in this time period the @entity177 would develop a skeleton and becomes even more fierce .			0
