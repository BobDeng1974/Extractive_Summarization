@entity2 ’s nuclear power stations are under threat from attacks by drones , it has been claimed			1
a @entity7 - based nuclear expert investigated the issue after a spate of mysterious and illegal flights by small unmanned vehicles over more than a dozen power stations in @entity13			1
and @entity14 warned that the problems arising there were of equal importance across the @entity18 , where the @entity2 has 16 operational reactors generating 18 per cent of our electricity			1
he examined four attack situations , saying the plants ‘ fared very badly indeed - if these scenarios had been for real , then there would have been the potential for a major radioactive release ’			1
@entity2 officials have studied mr @entity14 ’s evidence and handed it to the @entity39 , but have not asked for a copy of the report - however , the expert has urged them to reconsider this			1
according to an article by @entity46 on sunday journalist @entity47 , @entity14 large will meet with the @entity48 and @entity13 's nuclear and safety regulators next month regarding his report			1
energy secretary @entity52 told the newspaper that he ‘ would like to see ’ the report , although stressed it was ‘ unlikely ’ that it would tell ministers anything they had not already examined			0
incident scene : three people were arrested last month near the @entity60 reactor ( pictured ) in @entity61 , south of @entity62 , after using remote - controlled vehicles in a restricted area within 650ft of the plant it was revealed early last month that authorities in @entity13 had tallied at least 15 overflights of nuclear sites since october , culminating on one day with five at separate sites			1
drone attack threat : @entity7 - based nuclear expert @entity14 ( pictured ) has investigated the issue authorities insist that nuclear facilities in @entity13 - a country that largely lives off atomic energy - are built to handle seismic and security risks			1
state - controlled power firm @entity78 , which has had 13 sites flown over by drones , said the overflights had not affected plant operations			2
three people were arrested last month near the @entity60 reactor in @entity61 , south of @entity62 , after using remote - controlled vehicles in a restricted area within 650ft of the plant			2
but they were released when it emerged they were model aircraft fans in the wrong location			0
drones have vaulted into public awareness in recent years , ranging from ones as large as planes used by the @entity94 to bomb terrorist suspects , to small ones bought for fun			2
@entity98 has in recent years led peaceful incursions into @entity13 nuclear facilities to expose security vulnerabilities , but it denies any connection to the drone flights			1
@entity13 law prohibits individuals from operating drones in crowded areas , near airports , and near sensitive sites like military bases or nuclear plants			1
concerns about nuclear plant security were revived most recently after the 2011 @entity115 disaster in @entity116			2
@entity13 gets more than two - thirds of its electricity from nuclear power - the highest proportion in the world - and stepped up nuclear security measures after the @entity116 debacle			1
there are fears that this year ’s must - have @entity127 gift could cause a disaster in @entity2 's skies			1
warnings have been issued over the dangers posed to passenger planes by recreational drones flown by amateurs , with models as cheap as £ 35 being snapped up before december 25			0
sales have risen rapidly - around 2,000 a month are being bought - and electronics retailer @entity137 said they are one of its biggest sellers			0
the most sophisticated designs cost up to £ 3,000			0
they can include cameras and are usually used for recreational purposes – although increasingly they are being considered for commercial uses , such as carrying deliveries and monitoring crops			0
earlier this month the @entity149 reported how a remote - controlled drone flying near @entity151 almost crashed into a passenger jet - and was spotted by the airliner ’s pilot rather than radars			0
it was the first near miss between a passenger jet and an unmanned aircraft at @entity2 ’s biggest airport , but also the latest in a series of incidents involving unmanned planes			1
in may , the pilot of a 74 - seat plane reported that a quadcopter drone flew within 80ft as he was approaching @entity167			0
and in december 2012 the crew of a @entity169 777 coming in to land at @entity170 said they saw ‘ two white or silver discs ’			0
in april this year , the owner of a remote - controlled plane was ordered to pay £ 4,340 in fines and costs after his machine crashed in a no - fly zone near a shipyard in @entity179 for defence company @entity180 , where nuclear submarines were being built			2
attendees and consumers look at drones during the first - ever @entity185 in @entity186 on december 13 the @entity187 ( @entity188 ) has demanded better protection for the public against the risk of drones			0
there are currently few rules on operating drones			0
but @entity188 wants them to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft , including only being flown by operators with pilot - equivalent training			0
in october , intelligence experts warned of the misuse of drones and called for ‘ urgent ’ measures to safeguard @entity2 airspace to cope with commercial use , which is expected to be more widespread by 2035			2
their research for a @entity209 report said that the ‘ hazards presented by inadvertent or accidental misuse of [ drones ] , or the consequences of their malfunctioning , are becoming better understood ’			0
and a conference on unmanned craft in @entity7 last month heard that police were worried about injuries on @entity219 when amateur ‘ pilots ’ try out their new drones .			0
