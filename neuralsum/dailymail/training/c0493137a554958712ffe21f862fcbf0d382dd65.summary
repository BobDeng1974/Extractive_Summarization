by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 06:56 est , 15 october 2012 the @entity1 , which regulates the @entity3 's 670,000 nurses and midwives , has proposed increasing the annual registration fee from £ 76 to £ 120 nurses are facing a 60 per cent hike in the professional fees they must pay in order to work			1
the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , which regulates the @entity3 's 670,000 nurses and midwives , has proposed increasing the annual fee from £ 76 to £ 120			1
the regulator faces a significant hole in its finances , something it has blamed on the ‘ unprecedented increase ’ in the number of nurses and midwives whose conduct has had to be investigated over the past few years			1
but unions have condemned the move , saying it is ‘ inappropriate ' to increase fees while @entity25 workers are in the midst of a pay freeze			1
dr @entity28 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity30 said : ‘ nurses across the @entity3 are hugely concerned about the proposed hike in @entity1 fees at a time when many are struggling financially			2
@entity36 , chief executive of the @entity37 , added : ‘ we have argued that the cost of filling this hole should not fall on our cash - strapped members			0
’ today the government pledged a one - off £ 20 million grant to prevent nurses and midwives being forced to fork out an extra £ 44 each just so they can work			1
a spokeswoman said the money would ‘ protect nurses and midwives from the full impact of a proposed registration fee rise of almost 60 per cent ’			0
however it ’s thought there will still be some hike in registration fees even if this goes ahead			2
that ’s because the proposed fee rise would raise an additional £ 29m for the @entity1			2
even with £ 20m from the government , it is likely the regulator would still want some level of fee increase to balance the books			1
@entity63 understands the @entity64 hopes its intervention could see the fee rise lowed to around £ 100			2
the government has pledged a one - off £ 20 million grant to reduce the fee hike , but some increase is still expected , possibly to around £ 100 health minister @entity71 said the grant would be used to ‘ improve the @entity1 's performance ’ and help the body tackle the backlog of complaints against nurses			1
he said : ‘ following a period when we have heard of so many terrible abuses in the care of older people and vulnerable patients , it is important that organisations like the @entity1 are in the right shape to properly perform their job of protecting patients			0
‘ i am also mindful that , in these times of pay restraint , it is not right that hard - working nurses and midwives are burdened with the full financial cost of improving the @entity1 's fitness to practise function			0
’ the @entity96 can now decide whether or not to accept the grant			0
this will be determined at its next council meeting on 25 october , when a final decision on whether to go ahead with the fee rise is also expected to be taken			0
an @entity1 spokeswoman said : ‘ patients must be able to have confidence in the quality of care they receive from nurses and midwives , and we share the government 's commitment to improve nursing and midwifery regulation			0
‘ we welcome the government 's offer of a grant to give us further options to contribute to the costs of regulating nurses and midwives			0

the nursing regulator wants to increase professional fees from £ 76 to £ 120
unions argue the increase is *unfair* while @entity25 workers are suffering pay freezes
government pledges £ 20m grant to help but some fee hike still expected
