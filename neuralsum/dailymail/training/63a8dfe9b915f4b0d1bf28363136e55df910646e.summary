it is believed that when mr @entity5 first put the shackles on he heated them over an open flame which loosened the spring mechanism inside			1
when they were placed onto his wrists and held upright they would securely lock , but when they were turned upside down they would snap open			2

' he did a variety of water stunts and it is a possibility that these handcuffs could have been used in the @entity68 trick , which was seriously dangerous			2
' this pair have been altered so they unlock when manouvered in a certain way , and this is the first time i have heard of him using handcuffs like this			0
' there is no secret mechanism and they lock in the normal way , but it is thought that when he was wearing them he heated them up which relaxed the pressure on the spring			0
' this meant that when they were on they would be locked , but if they were manouvered in a certain way they would come open as a security measure			0
