the firms are vying for a slice of airwaves to launch superfast 4g networks up to seven times faster than current 3g versions			2
@entity17 said the auction , which kicks off in january , will herald ' better , faster and more reliable mobile broadband connections ' for consumers across the @entity10			1
the seven firms are bidding to join @entity22 in offering a superfast @entity6 mobile phone network in the @entity10 @entity17 confirmed that @entity26 parent @entity24 , @entity27 and @entity22 ( @entity22 ) are also on the list , as well as @entity30 conglomerate @entity29 and @entity10 network supplier @entity31			1
@entity32 , chief executive of @entity17 , said : ' the @entity6 auction will be a competitive process that will dictate the shape of the @entity10 mobile phone market for the next decade and beyond			1
' while all the @entity10 's major mobile operators are bidding , international player @entity29 and @entity31 are also competing to secure a slice of @entity6 in @entity10			1
@entity29 owns @entity40 , while @entity31 is a private - equity backed firm based in @entity42 that supports fixed and wireless services in the @entity10			2
bidders will be competing to buy airwaves in two separate bands - higher frequency 2.6 ghz and lower frequency 800 mhz - with around 28 lots of spectrum up for grabs in total			0
@entity22 , which was formed from the merger of @entity22 and @entity22 , already has access to @entity6 and was the first to offer a 4g network in the @entity10 , but is bidding to secure more airwaves in the sale			1
@entity3 has previously expressed interest in acquiring @entity60 frequencies to bolster its wi - fi offering , although it is not thought to have aspirations of becoming a major mobile player			0
it is hoped the @entity6 sale will generate a windfall for the government , following successful auctions in other countries			2
mobile operators in the @entity71 paid a total 3.8 billion euro ( £ 3.1 billion ) for the country 's @entity72 last friday , easily surpassing expectations of around 450 million euro ( £ 366 million )			0
in @entity76 last month , operators overcame a challenging economy to generate 854 million euro ( £ 700 million )			0
applications : the ' starting gun ' on the next generation of mobile phone signals has been fired @entity17 has placed a reserve price of £ 1.3 billion on the 4g sale , but the government 's tax and spending watchdog this month estimated a £ 3.5 billion boost to the public finances			0
the regulator wants at least four mobile wholesalers in the @entity10 to drive competition in the market and said the auction had been designed to achieve this			1
the watchdog said 4g services should make it much quicker to surf the web on mobiles , giving speeds close to home broadband services and allowing consumers to stream high - quality video , watching live tv and downloading large files			0
for the typical user , download speeds of initial @entity6 networks will be at least five to seven times faster than those for existing 3g networks			0
this means a music album that takes 20 minutes to download on a 3g phone will take just over three minutes on @entity6 .			0

firms will be able to launch early next year following january auction
