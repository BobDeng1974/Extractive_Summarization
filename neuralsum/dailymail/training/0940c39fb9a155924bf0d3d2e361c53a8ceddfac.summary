@entity0 opens up about how life in the @entity2 was n't always fair unsurprisingly , perhaps , you get more sense from a member of a girl band when she 's no longer a member of that band and has reached the grand old age of 32			1
there 's no doubt @entity11 could still rock the skimpy little outfits she used to wear in her days with the @entity2 - the band , fronted by x factor judge @entity13 , whose risqu√© outfits and dance moves left very little to the imagination			1
but ask her about the wider implications of spending much of your twenties parading around in your pants ( even if it is in the name of empowerment ) and she gives a considered reply			1
' let 's face it , we were a product , ' she says			1
' it was n't a message we disagreed with - the band had been built on that sexy image , so running around in fishnets and undies was part of it - but it was quite weird			1
in your twenties you 're trying to figure out who you are ; making mistakes , wanting to be sexy , growing up as a woman			1
' all of which , she adds , is difficult when you 're living in a bubble			1
' one of the weirdest things for me , when the @entity2 split four years ago , was having to adapt to the real world			1
actually going to the supermarket to get my own groceries was a revelation			2
i 'd never had to fill the fridge before , do my laundry , put petrol in my car			2
it was scary - but there was a kind of joy about it too			2
' when @entity2 split it was generally assumed @entity13 - always the focus , to the point where it reportedly led to feuding within the band - would go on to greater things			1
as well as forging a solo career , she ended up on the @entity74 panel , immediately acquiring a wider , more mainstream , fanbase			1
this has been the case too , to a lesser degree , with @entity0 , who in 2012 was runner - up on i 'm a celebrity			1
the high - risk move ( it involved eating camel 's unmentionables ) seems to have worked			2
she 's since segued , via the judging panel of @entity88 , into presenting work , most notably alongside @entity90 on @entity91			2
so , is she having a fling with @entity93 , as has been reported ? ' no , ' she says			1
' that was the media having fun			2
i do n't have a boyfriend			2
i never wanted to get married until quite recently , but now the first of the @entity2 has settled down ( @entity99 got married in february ) i 'm thinking more about it			2
i just need to find the right guy			2
i love hanging out with @entity90 because they 're such fun , but there 's no romance			2
' @entity0 ( far right ) describes being in the band as being a ' product ' later this summer , @entity0 brings out her first album since leaving the dolls , marking a return to the singing career she embarked on as a toddler in @entity112 , @entity113			1
her father @entity114 was a drummer who played for @entity115 , and she was on a stage almost as soon as she could walk			2
she jokes now that 's why the @entity2 ' outfits never seemed a big deal to her ( ' i spent my whole childhood in leotards , tutus , sports bras ; i was showing my midriff from the age of three ' )			2
yet the speed with which fame did arrive - when she was a 22 - year - old dancer - was phenomenal			2
the @entity2 , launched as a burlesque - style act , were catapulted to global fame almost overnight with the song @entity132			2
' it was like a rocket , ' she recalls			0
' all of a sudden there were fans waiting outside the hotel room and we were getting flown across the world			0
' in the melee , she admits now , she did n't stop to consider the small print			0
@entity0 denies rumours that anything romantic is happening between her and co-host , @entity93 ( right ) ' people think we must have made enough money never to have to worry again , but we did n't			1
i 'm not complaining - i got a home out of it - but did we make as much as we should have ? probably not			0
we knew there were certain amounts coming in that we were n't necessarily getting			0
at the beginning you do n't pay attention to that - we were all so young and excited - but after seven years of touring , when you 've made all these sacrifices and are burnt out , it matters			0
' it was n't just , she says , that the record company was getting more money than she feels was fair , but that other members of the band - well , @entity13 , the band 's main songwriter - was too			1
' it was n't equally divided , ' she says			1
' it was partly because of the writing , partly ... well , it just was n't			0
and that was fine at the start , but not towards the end			0
now , you look at bands like @entity172 and think , " why are they still together ? " the answer is they split everything equally			1
' she wo n't be drawn on the cattiness that seemed to surround the split , but stories have abounded of how only @entity13 was allowed to speak in press interviews , and how she always got what she wanted			0
is it true she did n't even travel with the others ? ' well , she did on flights , ' she says			0
' but on the tour bus , no. she had a separate bus			0
' why ? ' i do n't know			0
you 'd have to ask her			0
look , people have tried to say there was and is a feud , but it was n't like that			0
we were five girls in a band			1
with that , you get situations - time of the month , relationships , egos , insecurities			0
we were five girls put together on a crazy rollercoaster ride			0
it was a family - a dysfunctional family , but still a family			0
i went through everything , good and bad , with those girls			0
' she says she 's still in touch with @entity13 , but while the other dolls were at @entity99 's wedding , @entity13 was n't			0
' she was invited , ' says @entity0			1
' but she could n't come			0
' immediately after leaving the dolls , @entity0 engaged a life coach , ' to help me work out who i was '			1
@entity0 has found success in tv , including her appearance as a judge on dancing on ice as well as the rollercoaster of her professional life , she had a turbulent family life to deal with			1
when she was 14 her parents divorced			0
then when her father 's showbiz career dried up , he turned to selling cars but was declared bankrupt in 2005 and later accused of defrauding investors			0
her younger brother @entity234 , 27 , has schizophrenia and has convictions for violence , indecent exposure , drugs and theft			0
for years she did n't mention him at all in interviews			0
now she says his issues ' are finally being dealt with			0
it 's heavy , but he 's in a home now			0
he has the help he needs			0
when i 'm back in @entity112 i visit him , hug him and tell him i love him more than anything			1
' she still sees her life coach regularly , and says she wishes she 'd worked things out earlier			1
' growing up , you run to work or to music , or to your escape - whatever it is - and do n't necessarily deal with the emotions underlying it all , especially in the @entity261 because we have a pill for everything			0
everyone should have a life coach			1
we learn history , maths and science at school , but we do n't have the tools to understand emotions ; to release them and not hold on to anger			1
my life coach is my angel			1
