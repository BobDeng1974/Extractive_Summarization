with plenty of dogs waiting eagerly to be petted and a warm welcome from staff , the @entity1 's visit to the @entity2 could n't have got off to a better start			1
then @entity8 , the 35 - year - old @entity9 - born model who has been dubbed the world 's most handsome man , arrived - and it appeared to get even better			1
@entity1 , smiling broadly , happily shook the model 's hand and followed it up with a chat with @entity18 's @entity17 judge @entity16 , another high - profile @entity19 supporter			1
after being welcomed by a ' dog guard of honour ' , the @entity1 and the @entity26 were ushered into the reception where @entity8 and a group of other supporters , among them comedian @entity33 , were waiting to meet her			1
the queen 's encounter with mr @entity8 is the third time a member of the @entity38 has had a brush with the world of showbiz in less than a week			1
last wednesday , the @entity42 found herself starring in a snapshot with glamour model @entity44 , taken during a visit to the @entity46			1
it was the @entity48 's turn the following day , with the 33 - year - old royal pictured happily hobnobbing with the cast of @entity51 during a set visit			2
lovely chat : the @entity1 smiled as she was introduced to @entity16 in the @entity19 reception unexpected meeting : the @entity42 bumped into @entity44 at @entity56 last week happy hobnobbing : the @entity48 with @entity51 's @entity58 ( @entity59 ) glamorous though mr @entity8 is , the @entity1 saved her biggest smile for the homeless dogs - many of whom were enjoying a grooming session in the new kennels when she arrived			1
one , a corgi named @entity66 , came within a whisker of being adopted by the world ’s most famous @entity69 enthusiast			2
the eleven year old pedigree , who arrived at the renowned animal rescue centre just last week , was introduced to the @entity1 as she toured the site in south @entity75			1
at first the gentle and well - behaved pooch put on a suitably regal show			0
but as the afternoon wore on he did what most dogs would have done , he sighed and appeared to nod off – leaving the dog - loving sovereign looking on with affectionate bemusement			2
asked by @entity19 ambassador , actress @entity16 , whether she was tempted to take the @entity69 home with her , the @entity1 was suitably diplomatic			1
‘ maybe , ’ she said			0
miss @entity16 then asked the @entity1 ’s husband , prince @entity26 , the same question			1
almost ! beama the corgi was almost adopted by the pet - loving monarch adorable : the @entity1 could n't resist stopping to pet members of her doggy guard of honour ‘ what @entity69 ? ’ the bemused royal asked , before turning to @entity8 and asking , ' have you got a @entity69 ? ’ ‘ no , sir , but i am tempted , ’ the underwear model replied			1
the @entity1 once owned a huge pack of the pampered animals – a breed she has loved since she was a girl - but given her advancing years has slowly been allowing the number she owns to dwindle			1
currently she owns two corgis , @entity104 and @entity105 , and two @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
although she has long been associated with pedigree breeds , the @entity1 appeared delighted by the group of waifs and strays that greeted her today as she arrived at the home			1
the sovereign was visiting the iconic rescue centre in her role as its royal patron , a position she has held for almost 60 years			0
waiting to greet her , appropriately , was a ‘ guard of honour ’ comprised of a dozen of the 9,000 dogs ( and , now , cats ) that pass through its doors each year			2
after passing through the canine guard , the queen and her husband @entity26 , were greet by the home ’s chief executive , @entity130 , chairman @entity131 and her cousin , prince @entity132 , who is @entity19 ’s president			2
the royal party then proceeded to the new @entity28 , named after @entity19 's founder , which will provide accommodation for 56 animals			2
enjoying the visit : both the @entity1 and prince @entity26 looked thrilled to be at @entity19 keeping an eye on things : the @entity1 watches exercise classes ( left ) and heads to the reception ( right ) the kennels have been designed to make the often stressful experience of being brought to the home as comfortable and easy all as possible			1
all of the kennels have in built speakers so soothing music can be played to the animals , some of @entity19 ’s most vulnerable and anxious dogs			2
the @entity1 viewed the new facilities , meeting both staff and dogs , including an adorable mongrel puppy called @entity156 , who was found wandering the streets last week , and a three - year - old greyhound , @entity160			1
prince @entity26 was taken aback by the facilities on offer , which also boast underfloor heating			0
‘ they have inside and outside areas and beds ? wonderful , ’ he said			0
they were also taken to see the exercise paddocks where more dogs were undertaking training and exercise , before unveiling a plaque to mark the opening of the new kennels			2
it was in the exercise area that the sovereign was introduced to @entity178 by television presenter @entity179 , who outlined his sad story			2
the @entity69 was actually rehomed by @entity19 as a puppy eleven years ago and proved to be a wonderful family dog , playing with his owners ’ children and grandchildren			0
sadly , however , the elderly couple have moved to a retirement village where they are not permitted to keep animals , which means @entity66 has found his way to @entity19 again			0
‘ he ’s a beautiful dog and if i did n’t have five already myself i would be tempted to take him , ' said mr @entity33			1
grand opening : the @entity1 unveils a plaque after officially opening the @entity198 on her way : her majesty makes her exit after touring the @entity2 in @entity75 ' he has the most lovely temperament			1
she seemed fascinated by him but was n’t in the market , unfortunately			0
but now he has met her majesty at least we can say he is by @entity207			0
’ before they left the royal couple were given bags packed with treats such as collars and toys for their own dogs			2
prince @entity26 appeared tickled pink , joking : ‘ gives new meaning to the phrase doggy bag ! ’ afterwards @entity16 said she had been thrilled to see the @entity1 offer her support to the home			1
‘ i was always a huge fan before i took on the ambassador ’s role			0
we already have one dog but i have told my daughters we may well get another one in the autumn			0
we will see how things go , ’ she said			0
@entity2 was established in 1860 by mrs @entity198 who was concerned by the number of stray animals roaming the streets of @entity75			1
then known as ' the @entity231 ' , it was originally based in north @entity75 before being moved to @entity19 in 1871			0
since then , @entity19 has rescued , reunited or rehomed more than 3.1 million dogs and cats and currently cares for around 9000 animals a year			2
the queen is , of course , most famously associated with the @entity69			0
the breed was introduced to the @entity38 by her father , @entity238 , in 1933 when he bought a @entity69 called @entity239 from a local kennels			0
the animal proved popular with his daughters and was described as ‘ unquestionably the character of the @entity244 ’ delightful canine family ’ and ‘ a born sentimentalist ’			0
a second @entity69 was acquired called @entity247 who had puppies , two of which , crackers and @entity251 , were kept			0
for her eighteenth birthday , @entity1 was given a @entity69 named @entity254 from whom numerous successive dogs were bred			1
some corgis were mated with dachshunds ( most notably @entity257 , who belonged to @entity258 ) to create ‘ @entity259 ’			0
at present , the queen owns two @entity69 : @entity104 and @entity105 and two @entity106 : @entity107 and @entity108			0
the @entity1 ’s corgis travel with her to the various residences , with her majesty looking after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule			1
over the years , the @entity38 seem to have embraced dogs as their favoured pets			0
formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show kings , queens and their children happily posing with their beloved animals , from pugs to greyhounds , @entity275 to @entity69			0
some pets have even merited their own portraits , and , as in many households , were considered very much members of the family			0
when @entity1 @entity283 ’s beloved @entity282 , @entity284 , died at @entity285 in 1887 , he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone , which read : ' noble by name by nature noble too faithful companion sympathetic true his remains are interred here ' a terrier named @entity295 belonging to @entity296 was given even greater status when , having outlived the king , he walked behind his majesty ’s coffin in the funeral procession			1
the @entity42 owns two @entity303 terriers , @entity304 and @entity305 and , who both came from @entity2 .			2

model , 35 , is *regularly* described as one of the world 's most handsome men
meeting echoes last week 's encounter between @entity316 and @entity44
