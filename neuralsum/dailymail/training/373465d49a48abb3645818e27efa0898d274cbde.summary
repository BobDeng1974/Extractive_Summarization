an @entity2 striker with a hunger for goals and an even bigger appetite for hard work , @entity0 may not be @entity7 ’ most polished player , but he is certainly shining right now			1
he scored his 11th of the season to set his team on their way during sunday ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity13 , a powerful header his latest instinctive effort from inside the penalty area			1
it was the third time that @entity0 has scored in a 2 - 1 triumph away from home this term , the points to which those goals equate proving the difference between seventh and 11th			1
scroll down for the top 10 distances covered by forwards this season @entity0 rose above the rest to score the opening goal during @entity7 's win against @entity13 it is patently obvious what playing for his boyhood club means to the striker and this , do n’t forget , from a 21 - year - old who started the campaign as very much the understudy to leading man @entity37			1
the @entity7 strikers define polar opposites of the scale measured by effort , energy and endeavour			1
@entity0 is all action , he wears his heart on both sleeves			2
at the @entity47 he ran a staggering 8.2miles , a distance only matched by @entity50 among the visiting team			0
some may argue he lacks the finesse of the very top forwards , but if goals are the currency in which strikers trade , @entity0 is cash rich			2
from 23 senior starts for @entity7 , he has 17 goals			2
the manner in which he first sniffs out chances and then disposes of them is at times effortless , a natural instinct which very few boast			0
he certainly wo n’t hide should opportunities go begging , either			0
but there is more to his game			0
his performance in last month ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity69 – in which he did n’t score but assisted both goals – drew praise from @entity72 , the @entity73 pundit and @entity75 columnist , declaring that @entity0 had been the best player on the pitch			2
he invigorates others with an urgency and enthusiasm sadly lacking in too many residing at @entity80 in recent seasons			0
the @entity83 - born @entity7 fan is a mascot for supporters – ‘ @entity0 , he ’s one of our own ’ – and with him in the team it injects belief and excitement			1
@entity0 is a completely different striker to the much - maligned @entity37 @entity91 ( pictured posing for a selfie with a young fan ) would do worse than to look at @entity0 for @entity95 @entity0 's desire and work ethic have made him a firm fans ' favourite in under a season around the first team he has won his place in the side through a single - minded determination – there is no big price tag or inflated reputation to justify his inclusion , it is down to the will of the player alone			1
in an age where academy graduates are all too expectant of progression and bemoan a lack of opportunity , @entity0 has served his time at @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			2
from @entity122 to the @entity123 and eight goals in the @entity125 , @entity0 is proving himself very able			0
perhaps @entity91 should check on his progress			0
for @entity0 – who is also eligible for @entity128 – has already announced his intention to break in to the @entity95 senior team			0
and when @entity0 sets his target , you would n’t bet against him hitting it			0

@entity0 has impressed for @entity7 this season
the young striker should the opener away at @entity13 on sunday
@entity0 is the polar opposite to @entity37 up front
