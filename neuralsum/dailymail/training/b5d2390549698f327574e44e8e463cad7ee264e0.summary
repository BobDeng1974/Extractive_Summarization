for as long as i can remember , i ’ve been fascinated by superheroes			1
i do n’t know if it was the good versus evil stories , the fact justice always prevailed or simply the fact that @entity5 will always be the coolest man on the planet			1
i ’m 29 now , and still find myself wishing i was him			1
his arch enemies , @entity10 and @entity11 , were part of the appeal			1
but now i question exactly what these fictional characters mean and say about society			1
@entity17 acted alongside under the skin with @entity19			1
@entity17 suffers from @entity20 , which has given him facial disfigurement film baddies are often scarred , marked or have a condition of some kind			1
in @entity27 stories , the villain is always disabled or disfigured – these things are a reason for why they turned bad			2
in @entity31 , the most recent film , @entity31 was a former @entity33 agent turned terrorist – and this alone was enough for me not to want to follow him on @entity37			2
but , just to leave the audience in no doubt that this was the bad guy , to be feared , they gave him melted teeth and a sunken left cheek ( the result of a botched suicide attempt – nice ! )			2
i ’m a fan , but i wonder , are these portrayals necessary ? they are certainly not realistic , so i worry about the message they send out about people who , like me , look different			2
my genetic condition , neurofibromatosis , causes excess body tissue and non-cancerous tumours			1
' having had my first taste of movie making , starring opposite the gorgeous @entity19 in under the skin ( and for much of it , we were both naked ) i ¿ m now intrigued about what else is out there , ' @entity17 writes @entity62 is the @entity64 ’s leading charity that supports and represents people who have conditions or injuries that affect their appearance			1
in 2012 it launched its @entity70 in @entity72 campaign , which aims to readdress the balance and challenge audience perception			1
the charity created a short film featuring @entity77 , a campaigner who has burns , and @entity80 – of @entity82 fame			2
we see pretty @entity80 at home alone , and @entity77 outside in a car			2
eventually he knocks at the door and she answers			2
there is a moment of suspense and then they hug , and he hands her a bottle of wine as she says , grinning : ‘ you ’re early ! ’ the screen fades to black , with the words : ‘ what did you think was going to happen ? ’ the idea is that people would think he was about to do something horrible to the girl			2
i asked @entity105 , chief executive of @entity62 – who is facially scarred himself – about why fictional portrayals matter			2
he told me : ‘ the way that people react in the cinema can spill over into everyday life			0
we have to put up with people laughing at us , recoiling or staring in disbelief			0
' it is vital that the film industry takes this seriously and starts to portray disfigurement in a more balanced way			0
’ are we being overly sensitive ? @entity119 recently asked people what they deemed to be ‘ villainous characteristics ’ in film			0
almost half of the thousands surveyed said ‘ scars , marks , and burns ’			1
bad teeth , baldness and use of a wheelchair were also singled out			0
@entity19 stars in under the skin , which will be released in april			1
@entity17 played alongside her which he says has inspired him to take on more roles i ’m not saying we need to abolish such portrayals altogether			1
but if we are going to have film characters with disfigurements , why not get those who actually have them to act ? we ’d certainly never have a white actor ‘ black up ’ to play @entity146 , for instance			0
there have been steps forward recently : @entity151 , one of the lead actors in @entity153 , has a form of dwarfism			0
he ’s since been cast in films where his height is n’t even really mentioned			0
an episode of @entity159 recently featured an actress with @entity162 ’s syndrome , and an actor with cerebral palsy			0
having had my first taste of movie making , starring opposite the gorgeous @entity19 in under the skin ( and for much of it , we were both naked ) i ’m now intrigued about what else is out there			1
could someone like me become a film star ? i do n’t see why not			0
i ’d love to play @entity27 , but i would love to play a @entity27 villain too – who would n’t ? ' if we are going to have film characters with disfigurements , why not get those who actually have them to act ? we 'd certainly never have a white actor ' black up ' to play @entity146 , for instance , ' @entity17 writes it might seem a counterintuitive for me to pander to the lie that looking a bit different means you ’re evil , but hear me out			1
as a teenager , i was called @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			1
all three of these film characters with a scar , mark or illness is either a victim or psychotic killer			0
i could probably act the part , but in real life i am neither of these things			0
it ’s all about context			0
@entity205 ’s latest film , @entity206 , features a female character with a @entity209 - shaped birthmark , which is n’t dwelt upon but is still significant			0
these are the types of representations we need to see			0
ones that are simply incidental			0
likewise , if i were to play a @entity214 , i ’d want to be evil for the way i behaved and not the way i looked			0
it would be an opportunity to raise the profile of people like me who have a condition that affects their appearance			1
how would i feel if a child used my character ’s name as a term of abuse ? well , i ’ve been there , and hated it , but whether they ’re saying ‘ gay ’ or ‘ ginger ’ or ‘ cyclops ’ , some children will always be bullies			0
what i hope i can do is help to create a society where grown - ups do n’t hold these immature , naive prejudices			0
