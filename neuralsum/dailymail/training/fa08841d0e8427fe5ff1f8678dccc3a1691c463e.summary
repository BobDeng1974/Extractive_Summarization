' @entity1 flew to @entity23 and was taken to @entity24 , a @entity12 - controlled area of northern @entity6			1
for the past month , he has been a volunteer fighter helping to defend three small statelets in the area			1
as he recovered from his injuries - which sometimes still cause him to squint - he helped out the militia by taking to social media to recruit others , @entity18 reported			1
he 's been contacted by many former soldiers from across @entity40 , @entity2 and @entity41 , he said			1
they are attracted to fighting for the @entity12 militia for the same reasons as he was			0
' @entity4 has threatened all these countries ... to push their agenda in those nations , ' he said			2
' and the veterans of those nations who love their countries do n't want to sit by while this is happening			0
' calling : @entity1 , who is from @entity8 , ( pictured at home before heading to @entity6 ) said he had long wanted to be a soldier and felt at home fighting on behalf of the @entity13 new life : he left for @entity6 with a set of clothes , boots and deodorant - and quickly settled in , he said while @entity4 's efforts to encourage people to join their forces using social media has been documented , @entity1 's work gives an insight into how the @entity12 militia are recruiting from overseas using the same methods			1
@entity1 recently posted a message to his @entity14 page , urging would - be fighters to ' be patient as the outcry to join the fight is immense '			1

i think i decided enough was enough , and i decided to come out this way			0
' he had contacted the group online after @entity4 captured @entity85 in @entity5			1
' all the @entity2 veterans that have died over there and paid their lives for that country so they could have a democracy - that just resonated in my mind , ' he said			2
' and i could n't live with myself letting that country fall , and all my brothers ' lives be for nothing			0
' but as well as fighting for @entity2 - ' so [ @entity4 ] ca n't take it to us ' - he said he 's also fighting for the @entity12 people			1
aside from his political and religious beliefs , @entity1 explained that he was also driven to help because he has always wanted to be a soldier			2
after being honorably discharged from the @entity103 in 2007 , he missed military life			0

' over here , everything makes sense , ' he told @entity18			0
' i 'm at peace being here			0

he said that although he believes the @entity2 government is watching what he does , he does not think they will deny him re-entry when he tries to go home			2
but if that does happen , he would remain in @entity125 , he said			0
' once this fight is over , and @entity4 has been crippled , then the next stage of my life , then i 'll think about that , ' he said			2
new friends : @entity1 , pictured second left , said he could not allow @entity4 to take control of places , including in @entity5 , after @entity2 had fought hard - and lost their lives - for their democracy @entity1 is not alone : @entity135 , a 43 - year - old @entity136 veteran from @entity137 , is another of the few @entity2 that traveled to ' help the @entity13			1
' earlier this month , @entity135 's family said they were still unsure why he left behind his children to join up with the @entity12 militia , though a relative said : ' he 's a real big history buff and he has talked about the situation there			2
