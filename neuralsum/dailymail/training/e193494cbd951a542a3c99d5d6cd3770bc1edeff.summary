by @entity0 , political correspondent stinging attack : @entity3 diehard @entity2 wrote a furious open letter to @entity5 a @entity3 activist who accused @entity6 of molesting her quit the party in disgust last night after it decided not to censure him			1
in a stinging open letter to @entity5 , @entity2 said she and four members of her family would be tearing up their membership cards			2
the former county councillor revealed that a disciplinary review held by the party had ruled earlier this week that there was insufficient evidence the peer broke any rules			0
this is despite an earlier report by @entity22 which found broadly credible evidence that he had ‘ violated the personal space ’ of a string of women			0
miss @entity2 wrote : ‘ i can no longer remain a member of a party that feels it is acceptable for the then chief executive to invite me to his hotel room to advance my political career			1
‘ even though i have complained , and raised this for over seven years , the party still do not see the complaint as an issue			1
’ miss @entity2 is one of four female activists who spoke out to claim the party ’s powerful chief executive had inappropriately touched and propositioned them			1
in may , @entity6 , who had defied mr @entity5 ’s advice to say sorry to the women for four months , finally issued a statement admitting he ‘ may well have encroached upon personal space ’			1
although he made a grovelling apology for any harm or embarrassment caused to them , he claimed any such behaviour would have been ‘ inadvertent ’			2
miss @entity2 ’s resignation will pile more pressure on mr @entity5 to throw the peer out of the party – because @entity6 ’s allies have suggested he is keen to make a comeback as their election strategist			1
he is still suspended from his post pending an inquiry over the handling of the case brought by @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
miss @entity2 added in the letter , published on the @entity66 website : ‘ this week the appeals panel met and threw out our appeal to an unfair process			2
i have been called credible more than once			0
yet still no one feels it is appropriate to deal with the issue			0
’ she said other alleged victims had come forward since the media storm over the issue , and accused mr @entity5 of failing to take the claims seriously			2
comeback : @entity6 released a grovelling apology admitting he ' may well have encroached upon personal space ' - but maintained any behaviour would have been ' inadvertent ' ‘ only four of us were brave enough to go public – how many more do you need on public record ? ’ she wrote			1
‘ you have a serious thorn in your side			0
he claims to have built the party , but actually i see him destroying it			0
i wish you the very best for the future but your personal apology is not enough to keep my membership current			0
’ a former parliamentary candidate for the @entity3 , miss @entity2 said she had put ‘ love , effort , sweat and tears ’ as well as much of her own money into helping the party over the years			1
both her mother and father – himself a councillor for 24 years – and her son and daughter have also resigned their @entity3 membership in protest			0
a party spokesman said : ‘ we are saddened that @entity2 has made this decision which was clearly very difficult for her			1
she has been a devoted and passionate campaigner for the @entity3 cause over many years and will be sorely missed by many in the party			0
‘ the @entity3 recognise the seriousness of these complaints and that there was a failure in our processes which meant action was not taken sooner			0
’ mr @entity5 is also accused of being slow to respond to claims of serious sexual misconduct by @entity122 , the @entity123 mp , who made unwanted advances toward a vulnerable female constituent			0
the @entity127 report concluded it was ‘ unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that @entity6 had intended to act in an indecent or sexually inappropriate way ’ .			2

@entity2 said party still do not see @entity6 complaint ' as an issue '
one of four women who accused party chief exec of inappropriate touching
@entity6 , suspended pending inquiry , recently apologised for ' inadvertent ' behaviour
