other victims of the gang , who hid behind false names and front companies , lost their homes and suffered nervous breakdowns			0
judge @entity52 said : ' in short this was a grotesque , cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage they were doing			1
' the investors were persuaded by a team of brokers trained in the black art of pressure selling to part with money which in some cases was all they had saved			1
' many , once sucked in to making investments from which they had no return , were then pressured to go on and invest more in the hope something might materialise , trusting the assurances of those they believed to be working in their interests , people who they often came to think of as friend			0

he was jailed for six years and four months after the court heard he set up five companies to launder almost £ 9million of the profits and personally netting around £ 2million			1
he used the pseudonym ' @entity113 ' , @entity9 gave himself the surname ' legend ' , and @entity10 called himself @entity116 and even set up a front company @entity118 , named after himself and his alter - ego			1
@entity11 named himself after @entity121 star @entity120 as he gave the aggressive sales pitch to lure customers into the web of deceit			1
@entity9 , pictured left , was described as ' callous and greedy ' and jailed for six - and - a - half years in prison while @entity11 , pictured right , who netted around £ 200,000 , was also jailed for six - and - a - half years deception : the conmen inflated the value of the land and convinced their victims to invest using high - pressure sales techniques ' investors were persuaded to buy the plots by various high - pressure sales techniques , typically by cold - calling , ' said prosecutor @entity138			1
' they puffed up the value of the plots of land , and making representations that planning permission was being obtained or that a blue - chip purchaser is interesting in purchasing the land			1
' promises were made that the investor could sell the land back to the marketing company			0

cancer sufferer mr @entity95 and his wife @entity176 were among those sucked into the scheme , investing a total of £ 628,013 in @entity168 after being promised hefty profits in return for buying land			2
the retired couple from @entity184 , @entity185 , were first approached in march 2005 by @entity10 posing as @entity116			2
they were persuaded to part with more than £ 220,000 for plots in @entity188 , @entity155 , @entity189 , @entity190 , in @entity191 , @entity192 in @entity193 , and @entity194 in @entity195			2
' in short this was a grotesque , cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage they were doing			1
' judge @entity52 the couple had received titles for the land but seen no return by november 2007 , but were urged to buy more land in @entity205 , in @entity155			0
' they were expecting @entity167 to take steps to get planning permission and for an opportunity to sell at a profit when the land was snapped up by a developer ' , said mr @entity138			0
by march 2009 , the @entity213 were growing anxious but were met with excuses over the delay and encouraged to invest another £ 17,500 in the @entity154 site			0
@entity11 , as @entity120 , then told the couple some of their land was being bought up by an @entity221 investor , but another £ 100,000 was needed to seal the deal			1
the conmen strung them along with claims they were ' privileged clients ' , asking for increasing sums of money to ensure their investment returned a profit , until eventually they refused to pay any more and were told the money could not be returned			0
' mrs @entity231 felt that they had to keep paying or that they would lose everything ' , said mr @entity138			0
' they had been promised financial returns and got nothing			0
' they had been strung along and persuaded to make more and more payments			0
' the scam eventually unravelled after probes by police , trading standards , and the @entity243 , as well as 2010 exposes in the @entity244			0
@entity245 showed plots of land in @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , and @entity37 , were used in the scam , all of which were either green belt land or had no planning permission			2
raids of the trio 's homes revealed a host of fake passports , paperwork under aliases , and details of their victims			0
@entity11 's home computer had been used to search on @entity268 for ' @entity269 ' as the net tightened on the gang			2
the mastermind is believed to be a man called @entity274 , who is on the run and is thought to have fled the country			0
@entity11 , of @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity9 , of @entity279 , and @entity10 , of @entity280 , both @entity281 , @entity155 , were all found guilty of conspiracy to defraud			1
@entity8 , of @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , admitted the charge			2
false promises : the conmen convinced investors the land was needed as part of plans to build the @entity293 and @entity294 in @entity295 among other lies landbanking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years			1
companies divide land into smaller plots and sell it to investors on the basis that once it is available for development it will soar in value			1
fraudsters will use high - pressure sales tactics by cold - calling names and numbers from publicly - available shareholder lists			0
they can also use email , post , word of mouth or talk at a seminar or exhibition			0
in fact , the land is often in areas of natural beauty , historical interest or has little chance of being built on and the people behind these companies are actually highly - skilled criminals			0
the @entity243 estimates landbanking schemes have so far cost @entity325 investors more than £ 200million			0
although not all landbanking schemes are a scam , it is often not made clear to investors that there are restrictions on the development of the land or that it is otherwise protected			2
they offer this advice on how to protect yourself : - contact the local council where the land is located and asking them whether the land might ever be released for development			0
just because the person promoting or operating the scheme says it is guaranteed the land will be developed does not necessarily mean it will be			2
- if you have already invested in a scheme and are concerned , stop sending money to the firm and individuals involved			0
if you have given them your bank account details , tell your bank immediately			0
- contact the @entity355 with as much information as you can about your investment and the company involved , including their contact details and ‘ firm reference number ’ ( @entity362 )			0
