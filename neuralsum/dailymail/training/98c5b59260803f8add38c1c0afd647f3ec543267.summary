by @entity0 no your eyes are not deceiving you , that is a man water - skiing across a lake being towed by a plane			2
flying at only 40 - feet above the surface , the plane propels the intrepid extreme sportsman along at speeds of almost 60 mph			0
to make maters even more impressive , the water skier at @entity11 , @entity12 is bare - footed - making the high speed of the plane a necessity			1
scroll down for @entity17 terrifying : the expert water skier is being pulled along at speeds approaching 60mph by the sea plane and , just to top things off , the bare - footed skier launches himself off a ramp , remaining airborne for a good couple of seconds before hitting the water having jettisoned the tow line			0
only a select few at @entity11 have even attempted this level of stunt , with @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 of @entity35 being among the elite club			1
here we go ! the skier flies off the ramp - letting go of the two rope before he lands in the waters at @entity11 in @entity12 smooth : the skier glides across the waters as the plane drags him along at high speed another pass : the water skier finds himself approaching the ramp one more time being pulled along by the plane brave : launching into the air for another leap into the unknown - injuries can easily happen with water skiing at this speed the stress and strain of keeping your body gliding along the water barefooted is physically exahusting according to the skiers of @entity11 because the boat , or in this case plane , has to travel at higher speeds than for normal water skiers			2
the discipline of barefooted water skiing was conceived by @entity69 in the late 1940s and is considered the most dangerous form of the extreme sport .			0

*incredible* stunt was performed by @entity35 at @entity11 , @entity12
