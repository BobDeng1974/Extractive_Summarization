twins who had to be resuscitated moments after being born ten weeks prematurely have finally recovered enough to go home			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , both 31 , today described the terrifying moment they watched as a team of 11 medics battled to save their newborns at @entity11			1
since then siblings @entity12 and @entity14 have battled conditions such as a bleed on the brain , and heart and lung problems , but have now gone home after nearly four months			1
' we did n't know what was going to happen to either of them , and that 's the worst feeling in the world			0
' @entity4 's wife , @entity42 , 31 , suffered no complications during her pregnancy and during her 20 - week scan the couple were told they would be having twins			1
but at 30 weeks , @entity42 suddenly went into labour and was taken to @entity50			1
@entity4 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , said : ' they had hoped to transfer us to @entity56 's @entity55 , but there was no time and she underwent an emergency caesarean section			2
' they brought in a team of medics from the @entity55			0
there were about 10 or 11 of them all in theatre with us ready to help			0
' tiny : mrs @entity5 was told at 20 weeks she was having twins , but at 30 weeks she suddenly went into labour , and was rushed to @entity11 ( @entity14 pictured ) desperate : doctors had hoped to mrs @entity5 to @entity70 , but there was no time , so instead a specialist team of 11 was brought to her ( pictured , @entity12 in his incubator ) stable : after they started breathing again @entity12 ( pictured ) , who weighed 3lb 5oz and @entity14 , weighing 2lb 5oz , were transferred to @entity56 and spent several more months receiving specialist treatment seconds after they were born , @entity12 weighing 3lb 5oz and @entity78 , the team realised the babies were not breathing properly and began trying to resuscitate them			1
@entity4 said : ' @entity42 and i did n't know what was going to happen			1
because they were so small we knew they would have problems breathing by themselves			0
we 'd had no sleep and were shattered			0
' both children were put on ventilators to help them breath and transferred to the @entity92 where they spent the next two months in special care			1
@entity12 had suffered a bleed on the brain while @entity14 had problems after she vomited blood			1
the pair were then transferred up to the @entity55 where they spent another month before finally being allowed home just a few weeks ago			2
@entity4 said the pair , now four months old , are slowly starting to recover			2
recovery : @entity12 has a heart murmur which will require surgery , and @entity14 is being tube fed , but both are now back at home and on the road to recovery he said : ' @entity12 does have a heart murmur which means he will need an operation in the future			1
he also has to have some scans this week to keep a check on any concerns about blood on the brain			0
' @entity14 is on a feeding machine 24 hours a day at the minute			2
obviously the last few months have been a lot of work for us			0
because there are two of them , it 's double the worry			0
' @entity4 , an insurance investigator , has been forced to take time off work , while @entity42 is currently on maternity leave from her job as a manager for a plumber 's merchant			2
