whether they are hunters or the hunted , these cunning animals are all masters of disguise who can fool even the most beady - eyed passer by into believing they are not there			1
some hide under lily pads , some dissolve into the bark of a tree while others slip seamlessly into the snow , either to hide from a hungry predator or silently stalk an unwitting prey			2
but the one thing from which they can not hide is the all - seeing camera lens of photographer @entity18			1
he has spent over 35 years roaming the deserts of @entity27 , the rainforests of @entity24 , the mountains of the @entity20 and snow plains of @entity22 to capture wildlife at its most invisible			1
it 's white in front of you ! a willow ptarmigan in winter plumage , hidden on a brushy slope near @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity22			2
the animals are trying their utmost to fool predators but that 's not enough to deceive international photographer @entity18 he has travelled through every continent in the world in tireless pursuit of more subjects for his chef - d'oeuvre ' @entity48 ' that dates back to the 1980s			1
@entity18 said : ' throughout my career as a nature photographer , i have challenged myself to present new perspectives on well - documented subjects			1
' like most of my projects this collection has been a long time in the making			2
' finding and filming animals on location is an exhilarating and painstaking process			1
i 'm still adding to the project even now			2
' conventional wildlife photography calls for isolating the subject by selective focus , this way the animal is clearly defined			0
having a giraffe : a @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity27			0
@entity71 's 35 - year career has spanned every continent as he has followed his passion for the environment ca n't see the wolf from the trees : a wolf peering out from behind a tree trunk in an autumn @entity80 forest eye spy : a spectacled caiman in @entity83 , @entity84			1
@entity71 works to make it visually challenging to the viewer by using depth of field , scale and placement and confusing the subject cunning tricks : a @entity92 uses colour in its plumage to disappear in a temperate forest in @entity96 in @entity97 , left , while an @entity98 performs a vanishing act in the @entity100 of @entity101 , right leaf me alone : a @entity104 or @entity105 - crowned parrot disappears like just another leaf in the lush @entity108 rainforest , @entity109 , @entity110 ' photographers always want to show off their subject			0
and yet , is this really the way an animal is viewed by the human eye ? not quite			0
' we do n't have the isolating abilities that a telephoto lens provides			0
on most occasions an animal remains somewhat concealed by the clutter of its natural habitat - a necessity of survival for both predator and prey			0
' i have basically employed three different photographic approaches and purposely worked to enhance the difficulty to find the camouflaged subject - as difficult as it is in the wild to see animals that do not want to be seen			2
snake eyes : a horned adder matches the colour of the sand in the @entity138 , @entity139 , where they bury themselves using a swimming motion to disappear beneath the hot surface can you spot me ? a leopard conceals herself in vegetation at the base of a tree in @entity150 , @entity69 , @entity27 rock and hole : a gyrfalcon at their nest built on a cliff , left , and a @entity157 blends in with its rocky environment , right bark and hide : a @entity160 positions itself in front of a similar pattern to take advantage of his camouflage in @entity97 , @entity20 ' since it is impossible to capture all the distractions to the senses of an entire landscape in a photo , i worked to make it visually challenging by using depth of field , scale and placement and confusing the subject			0
' art is also a successful book publisher and television producer			0
he has published at least one book a year since 1989			0
the 61 - year - old from @entity183 said : ' it is in the wild places , where the edge of the earth meets the corners of the sky , the human spirit is fed. ' invisible : a male @entity191 disappears among sun - dappled vegetation in @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 stop monkeying around : a family of @entity199 macaques disappear amid their rocky habitat on @entity202 , @entity199 i 'm white over here ! @entity204 in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity22 the long grass : an @entity206 hiding in vegetation in @entity209 's @entity208 , @entity27 a sandy place to hide : a cheetah cub disguised against the @entity212 , @entity27 water good place to hide : a @entity214 , well hidden in the shoreline vegetation of a @entity217 stream painstaking : mr @entity18 , right , says finding and filming animals on location , such as this wandering tattler chick in @entity221 , left , is ' an exhilarating and painstaking process ' out of sight hawk : a nighthawk resting on rocks where it blends into its surroundings in eastern @entity101 @entity228 way i 'll be spotted here : a coyote camouflaged in the surrounding brush at the edge of a snow dusted field , @entity101 , @entity20 precarious perch : two @entity237 camouflaged against a rocky outcrop in @entity208 , @entity209 branching out : a well - concealed blue dacnis takes a rest in foliage in @entity242			1
