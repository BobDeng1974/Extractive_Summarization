by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 9 august 2013 @entity1 and sir @entity2 have been accused of using @entity3 as a ' laboratory ' for the drug reform after backing a campaign to legalise cannabis in the country			1
@entity3 is set to become the first nation in the world to allow anyone to grow , sell and consume cannabis freely			1
the legal changes were brought about after a high - profile lobbying and tv campaign by pressure group the @entity16 , on which both @entity1 and sir @entity2 are honorary international board members			1
meddling : pop star @entity1 , left , and sir @entity2 , right , are honorary members of the international board of pro-reform pressure group @entity16 which has been accused of meddling in @entity22 's politics but the involvement of this influential @entity25 drug law reform organisation has been branded as ' meddling ' and prompted a fierce backlash from critics of the legal changes			1
@entity30 , of the opposition @entity31 , launched a blistering attack on the two celebrities , accusing them of risking the health of a generation with their ' meddling ' and turning the country into a ' laboratory ' for reform			1
he said : ' they should n't be meddling in @entity3			1
' they should be lobbying in their own country because they 're not going to suffer the consequences here , the security and health problems			2
controversy : president @entity47 has seen his efforts to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs succeed in the face of opposition ' they 're out of context here			0
this is a test that could go wrong and harm a generation			0
' speaking shortly after legislation was passed though congress , last week , mr @entity30 , said the @entity62 government was ‘ playing with fire ’ given the health risks he said were linked to marijuana use and the majority of @entity3 are said to be against the decriminalisation move ' you must be toking : @entity3 's unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has made it halfway through congress he said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana , which he called a ' gateway drug ' for other chemical addictions that foster violent crimes			1
' ninety - eight percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana , ' responding to the controversy , sir @entity2 said : ' while i am a member of the @entity85 ( in formation ) , i am an active member of the @entity87			1
' for the past few years we have examined the war on drugs using a science - based approach			0
' we feel strongly that it has failed and that there needs to be a different approach			0
' we believe drugs should be treated as a health problem not a criminal problem			0
' this is a global problem , not a national issue , and everyone who can should speak out to help change the failed war on drugs			1
' under a new bill passed by @entity3 lawmakers , only the government would be allowed to sell the drug			2
the controversial measure has the backing of president @entity47 , who says it will remove the profits from drug peddlers and divert users from harder drugs			0
@entity3 ’s @entity113 passed the bill by 50 to 46 votes following a fierce debate earlier this month and it is expected to get an easier passage through the @entity117 to become law in the next few weeks			2
buyers would have to be over 18 and would be able to grow six plants at home or buy up to 40g ( 1.4 oz ) a month in specially licenced government pharmacies			0
the authorities would take control of every aspect of the marijuana business , from harvesting the plant right through to distribution and sale			0
@entity130 - rous game : marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the @entity134 in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in @entity139 and @entity140 and in an effort to prevent foreign tourists from flocking to @entity3 to smoke marijuana , the legislation would restrict legal purchases to @entity3			2
the vote also came days after @entity147 criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to neighbouring @entity150			0
he said it was ‘ necessary to tackle the problems which are at the root of drug abuse , promoting more justice , educating the youth with the values that live in society , standing by those who face hardship and giving them hope for the future			0
’ @entity1 was unavailable for comment .			2
