more than a third ( 36 per cent ) of @entity17 have returned to their preferred childhood break spot in the past five years , the study of 5,000 @entity9 travellers found			1
the survey uncovered that , for most of us , childhood memories are associated with seaside sensations - the swooshing crash of the sea ( 37 per cent ) and the sludge of wet sand between our toes ( 19 per cent ) being the two most cited sensations			0
an overwhelming 82 per cent of @entity17 named a destination in the @entity9 as their childhood treasure , with @entity46 holding the fondest holiday memories for a third ( 30 per cent ) , followed by the @entity48 ( 14 per cent ) and @entity49 ( 14 per cent )			1
@entity50 ! 82 % of @entity17 surveyed named a @entity9 destination as their treasured childhood holiday @entity53 , @entity16 spokesman , said : ' for many of us , our favourite memories as a child are often from when we were on holiday , so perhaps it is no surprise that so many of us relive those holidays again as adults			1
' but what is interesting is that when we do return we often find new things to fall in love with , which proves that it is worth taking the time to research new places to stay , eat and visit even if we 're travelling somewhere familiar			0
' nearly 90 per cent of @entity17 who have revisited their preferred childhood haunts in the last five years have not been disappointed ; most wanted to share their childhood holiday spot with their partner and found it lived up to expectations			1
46 % of parents have taken their children to their own favourite holiday destination in the last five years among parents , nearly half ( 46 per cent ) have revisited their favourite childhood holiday destination with their own children			2
three quarters ( 75 per cent ) of parents said their children enjoyed the familiar trip as much as they had done as a child , though interestingly over a third ( 37 per cent ) said that the reasons for this had been different ; everything changes			0
some 54 per cent of parents say they feel family holidays are safer now than they were when they were a child , and nearly three quarters ( 74 per cent ) feel there are more activities for the whole family to do than when they were young			0
