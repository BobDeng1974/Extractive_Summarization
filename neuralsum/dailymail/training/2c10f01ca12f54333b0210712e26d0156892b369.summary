by @entity0 a @entity2 company has made a sci - fi dream a reality , by creating a hub to control all smart devices found in the home , potentially saving people time and energy expended on menial tasks			1
@entity12 ’s @entity11 is essentially a hal for the home that lets users control internet - connected devices from a single place , much like the @entity18 computer imagined by @entity19 in his space odyssey series			2
more than 60 years later , engineers have created the device , which uses artificial intelligence to read a user ’s voice – much like @entity27 ’s @entity26 – to control a host of hi - tech home devices			1
the device , which costs $ 229 ( £ 144 ) , claims to be the first @entity38 voice - activated assistant for the home , which helps individuals manage and control their devices , as well as set reminders			1
the company said : ' our goal is to create a simpler and more natural way of interfacing with the internet and your smart home			0
' to give the hub a command , a user must first say ' hello @entity12 ' and the device will then listen for verbal clues when a person starts to talk - turning their words into actions			2
a beam - forming microphone array cancels ambient noise and makes it possible for a person to talk to @entity12 from up to 15 feet away			0
when the hub hears a voice command , it sends an audio file to @entity73 ¿ language - processing server , which converts the signal to text			0
the @entity31 then scans for keywords to work out the action it should perform the device , which costs $ 229 ( £ 144 ) claims to be the first @entity38 voice - activated assistant for the home , which helps individuals manage and control their devices @entity12 's @entity11 is much like the @entity18 ( pictured ) computer imagined by @entity19 in his space odyssey series when the hub hears a voice command , it sends an audio file to @entity89 ’s ‘ @entity73 ’ language - processing server , which converts the signal to text			1

a person might want to set a reminder , by saying something like ' remind me to pick up the kids from school at 2.45 ' and the device can text them their memo on - the - go , or they can control devices by saying : ' set the thermostat to 71 degrees '			2
a person might want to set a reminder and they can talk to the device , which will send a text message with the contents of their memo ( pictured ) to give the hub a command , a user must first say ' hello @entity12 ' and the device will then listen for clues when a person starts to talk			2
if they ask the machine to ' clean up , ' it can contact a smart vacuum cleaner to carry out the desired action ( pictured ) the hub is designed to be placed near a bed as it also functions as an alarm clock and displays live content , such as the weather , stocks and news			0
it also reads bedtime stories and can play relaxing noises until an individual falls asleep			0
while it is only compatible with a handful of internet - connected devices at the moment , the engineers are constantly revamping the @entity31 's software and say it ‘ gets smarter and more capable over time ’			1
the device is connected to a home @entity38 network and users can add gadgets connected to the internet , via a web dashboard ( pictured ) the hub is designed to be placed near a bed as it also functions as an alarm clock and displays live content , such as the weather ( pictured ) stocks and news the company has made @entity12 as ' open as possible ' by enabling developers to build on top of its voice programme , to allow computer - savvy people to add extra functions to the hub			1
the company said the device could be especially helpful for people who are visually impaired or who struggle with computer interaction			0
while it is only compatible with a handful of devices at the moment , the engineers are constantly revamping the @entity31 's software and say it ' gets smarter and more capable over time '			1

@entity12 's sleek uses artificial intelligence to read a user ’s voice in order to control a host of home devices that are connected to the internet
the @entity2 engineers behind the device , which costs $ 229 ( £ 144 ) claim it is the first @entity38 voice - activated assistant for the home
it is *presently* compatible with a handful of devices , but the engineers are constantly revamping the @entity31 's software so it becomes smarter over time
