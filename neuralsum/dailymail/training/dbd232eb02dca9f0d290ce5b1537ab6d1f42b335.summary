by @entity0 whenever my step - father had a tipple when i was a teenager , he ’d start off in a great mood , reeling off his extensive repertoire of silly jokes and making everyone laugh			1
but inevitably , after the second or third glass , he would turn to the same old subject : death			1
more specifically , his death			2
@entity14 ’s monologue soon became familiar ; how he never wanted to get old , that he would n’t be able to stand being diagnosed with a terminal illness — and abhorred the thought of being wheelchair - bound			1
always the joker : @entity0 with her fun - loving stepfather @entity14 my younger brother @entity19 and i would roll our eyes			1
our mother @entity23 would tease him that he was n’t going anywhere			1
but these conversations turned out to be more poignant than any of us realised back then			1
because , years later , the three of us found ourselves sitting at @entity14 ’s bedside as he lay unconscious , wired up to a ventilator — a machine pumping every breath into him — and we had to decide whether to turn it off			1
and with heavy hearts , we did			0
controversial though it might sound , it is my belief that we granted him the greatest gift of all			0
we did what he would have wanted , rather than cling on to him simply because we were too heartbroken to say goodbye			1
so , until i know that @entity43 legend @entity42 faces a good quality of life , i ca n’t rejoice in the news that he is now out of a coma			1
racing legend : a skiiing accident left @entity43 driver @entity42 in a coma last week , the former racing ace was transferred from @entity52 to a rehabilitation clinic in the @entity55 city of @entity56			1
for almost six months he ’d been kept in an artificially induced coma following his skiing accident in @entity59 last december			1
although he is said to have nodded to an ambulance crew , and has apparently kept his eyes open for extended periods , there is no indication if the fast - living @entity42 , loved by his family , friends and fans , will return to his old self			2
of course , i do n’t know if his family have faced the terrible decision of whether to turn off his life - support system			1
but with his wife @entity73 reported to be at his bedside permanently since the accident , it ’s obvious they ’ve been determinedly clinging on to hope			0
however , i believe hope can lead us down the wrong path			0
sometimes it exists only in our hearts , rather than our heads			0
and it ’s in those traumatic times , faced with losing those closest to us , and when their lives are in our hands , that we need to take decisions based not on emotion but on cold , hard facts			0
to that end i believe that sometimes , if you love someone , you ’ve got to let them go			0
that ’s what i and my family did , and there ’s not been a day since that i ’ve regretted it			0
my stepfather came into my life when i was just five , after my parents ’ marriage broke up			2
it was the early @entity105 and he quickly worked out that the way to my heart was through endless toys and gifts , whether it was the latest @entity110 or @entity112 game			2
he would spend hours painstakingly perfecting my school projects with me , we ’d fake wrestle on the living - room floor on saturday afternoons while @entity117 did the real thing on tv , and he ’d embarrass me by shouting my nickname ‘ @entity121 ’ across the school playground			2
fond memories : when @entity14 came into @entity0 's life , aged five , he quickly won her heart even in my 30s — i ’m now 37 — i ’d find a fake plastic lizard or some such silly thing in my handbag after returning to his and my mother ’s @entity131 home for the weekend			1
his idea of a little joke			2
@entity14 was ‘ @entity137 ’ to me			1
that ’s why i chose him to give me away when i got married , despite my biological dad still being alive			0
‘ a real dad is the one who is there for you day after day after day , ’ i texted to @entity14 on the last ever @entity140 we spent together			1
he was always fit and healthy — a passionate advocate of fruit and veg — and he cycled to and from work every day			0
he retired from his factory supervisor role in 2009 and he did slow down , a little			0
but it was highly unusual for him to not be able to shift a cough and virus that struck him down in march 2010			0
a couple of days later — on a monday morning — i got a call from my brother to say @entity14 had collapsed at home and an ambulance had taken him to hospital			1
loving family : @entity14 and @entity0 's mother @entity23 renewing their wedding vows a year before @entity14 died , with @entity0 ( right ) and her brother @entity19 ( left ) i raced out of my @entity163 magazine office and got a train to @entity131 while my brother did the same from @entity166			1
when i arrived at @entity168 , my devastated mother said that @entity14 had suffered two cardiac arrests and was in an induced coma while machines kept him alive			1
doctors never found an answer to why his body had failed him so catastrophically			2
his heart — in fact , all of his organs — were giving up on him , and he was only 63			0
the cramped waiting room for the intensive - care unit , with its endless cups of tea and hushed voices , was our home for the next three days			2
on the first day , i was too upset to sit by @entity14 ’s bedside , but the following day , when doctors decided to bring him round , my brother and i waited patiently next to him for some sign of life			1
sometimes his fingers might twitch and we ’d jump out of our skin , but mostly he was completely unresponsive			0
it was terrifying and bewildering			0
a real @entity137 : despite her biological father still being alive , @entity0 chose @entity14 ( pictured ) to give her away at her wedding first we were told to prepare ourselves for the worst , that each organ was closing down			1
then there seemed to be good news — he was attempting to open his eyes			0
yet this frightened me , too			0
because none of us knew if he would still be the @entity14 we all loved			1
there was a strong possibility he ’d suffered irreparable brain damage			1
my worst fear was that he ’d be trapped in a vegetative state			0
i remembered all of his monologues about death that we ’d sat through , and i knew that unless we could guarantee he ’d leave hospital as the man we ’d known — independent and able - bodied — he would n’t want to leave at all			2
and so , after consulting with my mother and brother , i told the doctors just that			1
i also asked if they were attaching some emotional significance to someone ‘ attempting ’ to open their eyes and whether it was medically any more significant than , say , a slight increase in kidney function			0
while any decision was ultimately for the doctors and my mum to take , i felt the weight of responsibility for @entity14 ’s life in my hands			1
surely we had to put our emotions aside and do what was right for him ? ultimate act of love : @entity0 still believes that letting @entity14 go was the right thing another day went by and there were no other signs of life			1
the medical evidence suggested his organs were closing down			0
so the three of us made the decision to let him go			0
the risks of him coming back with severe brain damage were too huge , his future too uncertain and , more than anything , i knew he ’d never forgive us for making him stay against his wishes			1
the doctors found it hard to accept our decision			2
that ’s understandable , as they ’d worked tirelessly to save him			0
but they also admitted that many families begged them to do whatever they could and then regretted it six months or a year down the line when their loved one had no quality of life			0
one doctor eventually told us we were doing the right thing — it was devastatingly sad but true			0
so we said our goodbyes , and i watched my mum kiss her husband of 30 years for the last time			0
we did n’t stay with @entity14 as he took his last breath — it would have been too traumatic			1
i just pleaded with the doctors to make sure he would n’t be in any pain			2
we drove home , mute with @entity274 , half an hour after we ’d arrived , we got the call to say he ’d passed away			0
the fact he had gone so quickly was proof again to me that we ’d done the right thing			2
we did what @entity14 would have wanted			1
please do n’t think i ’m judging the @entity279 if they want to try anything — and everything — to hold on to @entity42			0
he is n’t , after all , a 63 - year - old man who ’s been determined never to make old bones			2
at 45 , there ’s the possibility of many years ahead			0
it may still be that he ’ll make a miraculous recovery , though most doctors agree the chances are @entity291 @entity290 , a former @entity43 doctor , wrote on his blog this month : ‘ i fear there will be no more good news			2
’ and , having been in a similar situation , i fear the same			0
i never imagined as i skipped beside @entity14 when i was five that his life would one day be in our hands			1
but , in the end , i believe letting him go was the ultimate act of love .			0

@entity0 's stepfather @entity14 always said he never wanted to get old and could *n't* stand the idea of being terminally ill or wheel - chair bound
when two cardiac arrests left @entity14 in a coma with *probable* brain damage , the words came back to @entity0 , her mother and brother
despite doctors ' *protests* , they agreed to turn off @entity14 's ventilator
@entity0 thinks it was better he went quickly than lived on suffering
