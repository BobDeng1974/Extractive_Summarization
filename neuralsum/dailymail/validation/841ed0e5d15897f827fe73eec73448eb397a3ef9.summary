the 46 year old , who works as a graphic designer , said : ' i love to take photos of deer , and to see them in an urban environment was strange but satisfying when you got the shot			0
' the deer were very , very skittish and they are aware that they only have one or two escape routes if they need to run			0
' the slightest noise and they are off and for such a large animal they can disappear into the shadows in seconds			0
' unfortunately for the unsuspecting home owners , it was their immaculately kept gardens which lead to the deer wanting to eat their grass and plants			2
mr @entity66 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , said : ' there is a lack of natural woodland areas left for the deer , and for the number of fallow deer that are wild in the @entity75 now			1
the 46 year old , who works as a graphic designer , said to see them in an urban environment was strange but satisfying unfortunately for the unsuspecting home owners , it was their immaculate gardens which led to the deer to the area looking for new , safe places to eat the deer were drawn to the suburban area after dark , while residents were asleep ' the grass and plants in the gardens were well looked after so the deer go where the food is , and it just so happens it is around normal houses			0
' mr @entity66 added that patience and staying silent were key when photographing this big herd of deer in @entity10			1
he said : ' you have to be ultra quiet to do this type of photography , they are wild animals in an urban environment as so they are very nervous and disappear at the slightest hint of people			0
' when we saw the group we parked up around the corner and got out of the car , then crept as quietly as we could to get into a position where you hope the deer will walk into			2
' this is probably the hardest photography i 've done			0
' mr. @entity66 said he had to have as much patience with the animals as possible because they were nervous of their new surroundings carefully in position and hoping the deer would come near , the amateur photographer took these shots , the best he 's ever done			1

the herd of deer crept from their home in the woods to walk the deserted streets in search of a late night snack
they entered the @entity10 suburb completely alone , with the *exception* of amateur photographer @entity26
mr @entity66 waited quietly so that they were not scared and when the animals came closer took these pictures
