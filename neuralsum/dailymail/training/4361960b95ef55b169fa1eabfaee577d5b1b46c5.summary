a former @entity1 career girl has described her experience of giving up revealing clothes and make - up for a year - as well as completely covering her head , legs and arms - as ' liberating ' and ' frightening '			2
@entity8 was working as a receptionist on @entity10 when she started to become interested in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 belief systems			1
' every morning i would shoehorn myself onto the train with an army of ladies sporting fitted waistlines , toned arms , blown - out hair , full faces of make - up and heels , ' she writes on @entity25			1
' i hated every second of it			2
' before and after : shields during the experiment ( left ) and afterward with her @entity8 with her $ 2000 pink - highlighted hair extensions ( right ) she contrasted this with the headscarves and long skirts worn by @entity37 women in her @entity38 , @entity39 neighborhood			1
' these women were not “ fashionable ” first , like most of the women i saw everywhere else — they seemed to be focused on something else , something more important than what was trendy , ' she observed			0
where it all began : the idea for her modesty experiment began when she worked in @entity52 as a receptionist but she hated every second of it and felt like she was dressing up every day for nothing because she did n't practice those religions , @entity8 felt that she had no ' excuse ' to dress in a similar fashion			1
but two years later as a student at @entity62 in @entity63 , a woman spoke to her class about her experience in the @entity66 wearing a hijab			1
covering up : @entity68 says men take women who look like @entity71 less seriously her epiphany afterwards ? ' in @entity75 , @entity73 dress is often a choice , and the women who make this choice are declining to endorse @entity79 and the sexualization of their bodies '			0
' it 's a way of expressing modesty and resisting the pressure to be scrutinized against @entity87 standards of beauty			1
' so , with the support of her seminary community and then - boyfriend , she designed the @entity93			0
in order to help loosen her ' death grip on the idea that youth and beauty were prerequisites to relevance ' , @entity8 started a blog and @entity103 page			1
for nine months she covered all of her hair , wore nothing fitted , and only exposed her knees and shoulders at home			1
she also shunned makeup or nail polish , except on ' rare exceptions '			0
at first @entity8 felt more ' invisible ' - to both men and women - and missed her products			2
' i had been telling myself i was beyond superficiality when in fact i had bought the whole thing hook , line and sinker , ' she says			0
but there were also good points : she found that she got a lot more done when she was no longer obsessed with shoes			0
and she says she finally met ' men who believe that the more '' rich ' and made - up like @entity71 a woman looks , the less inclined they are to take her seriously as a co-worker or dating prospect '			2
concealed : for nine months she covered all of her hair , wore nothing fitted , and only exposed her knees and shoulders at home like - minded : she finally met ' men who believe that the more rich and made - up like @entity71 a woman looks , the less inclined they are to take her seriously as a co-worker or dating prospect ' one of them became her boyfriend , and the couple is now @entity145 project has caused controversy			1
many commenters accuse her of judging women who wear make - up in the same way she was judged			0
writer @entity151 of @entity152 commented that , with her tapered eyebrows and nose ring , ' she was putting just as much time and energy into her appearance as the vain women she pities			0
' the site called @entity68 's project ' superficial and silly ' and called her out for lengthy blog posts that complain about how hard the project was that only became more positive after she got a date			0
controversial : her project has caused controversy with many commenters accuse her of judging women who wear make - up in the same way she was judged letting go : @entity8 says that she was able to get a lot more done once she got rid of her shoe obsession ( left ) but admits she cried when she gave away her clothes ( right ) ' judging by her blog , she did n't feel all that fabulous about it , except when her antiquated , mishmashed concept of perfectly modest femininity was validated by a man			2
' @entity68 insists that looking good is n’t necessarily a bad thing , but ' when it becomes the cornerstone of your identity then you ’re doing nothing but damage to yourself , ' she writes			0
sharing her journey : in order to help loosen her ' death grip on the idea that youth and beauty were prerequisites to relevance ' , @entity8 started a blog and @entity103 page but it was n't too well received by some			1
