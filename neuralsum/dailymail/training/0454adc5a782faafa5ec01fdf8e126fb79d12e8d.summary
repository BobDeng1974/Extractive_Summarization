by @entity0 for @entity1 this is the dramatic moment a lifeboat had to come to the rescue of two cars which became swallowed up by the sea within just 90 minutes as the highest tides of the year caught drivers out			1
two people were forced to climb onto the top of their vehicle 's roof as it became completely submerged in the @entity14 off the coast of @entity16 , near @entity17			1
at least one of the vehicles had been trying to pull a boat out of the water when it became stuck , the @entity18 said			2
the station 's inshore lifeboat was launched and on its arrival at the scene its crew found that the trapped people had made their own way to safety on the beach , one of them sustaining a small hand injury			2
to avoid the owner attempting to recover the vehicle himself in the face of the rapidly rising tide , and to avoid pollution from the vehicle 's fuel tank , the lifeboat launching tractor was used to pull it clear of the water			1
as the crew were standing down , more calls were made to the coastguard reporting that the driver of a second vehicle had got into difficulties while trying to recover a speed boat on to its trailer near the @entity75 at @entity76			0
the lifeboat re-launched , but on arrival its crew discovered that the driver was safe ashore and the vehicle was being rapidly submerged by the tide			2
the @entity18 said one vehicle had been trying to pull a boat out from the sea when it became engulfed with water an @entity18 tractor had to be used to help pull the vehicles from the water and the drivers escaped unharmed @entity89 , lifeboat operations manager at @entity18 , said : ' launching and recovering boats , whether it 's from the beach or a slipway , needs the right vehicle , a good understanding of what the tide is doing , and plenty of practice			1
' unfortunately it 's proved a very expensive afternoon for two car owners			0
fortunately , apart from a minor hand injury , no one has come to any real harm today , but the consequences could easily been much more serious			0
' and with some of the highest tides of the year right now , today could n't have been a worse day for this to happen			1
' the incidents occurred as the highest tides of the year so far hit across the @entity30 due to the ' supermoon ' - which occurs when a full moon or new moon has the closest approach to @entity114 over the year			1
the incidents occurred off the coast of @entity16 , @entity117 as the highest tides of the year so far hit the @entity30 the @entity18 said the high tides were caused by a ' supermoon ' which occurs when the moon comes closest to @entity114			1
the charity also urged members of the public to keep an eye on tidal patterns to avoid getting stranded an @entity18 spokesman added : ‘ it was a super moon and that affects the tide			0
they are the biggest tides we ’ve had so far this year			0
‘ if the wind was blowing the waves onto the shore it could cause a surge			0
‘ if people are n’t aware of the softness of the sand , they should be because it can catch them out and a car can sink very quickly			0
‘ people should stick to using official launching sites , on a good , solid beach			0
