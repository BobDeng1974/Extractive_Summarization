by @entity1 reporter published : 15:43 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 15:46 est , 23 february 2013 a woman who asked @entity3 a question on gun control during an online debate said yesterday that she found the vice president 's reply ' poor advice ' and ' sexist			1
' during the town hall on tuesday @entity10 put to @entity3 : ' do you believe that banning certain weapons and high capacity magazines will mean that law - abiding citizens will then become more of a target to criminals as we will have no way to sufficiently protect ourselves ? ' @entity3 told @entity19 to ' buy a shotgun ' , advice she felt was dismissive			1
' the vice president claimed that this would deter possible intruders and that homeowners do n't need weapons like the @entity41			1
' it ’s harder to aim , it ’s harder to use , and in fact you do n’t need 30 rounds to protect yourself			0
buy a shotgun , ' @entity3 advised			1
@entity19 appeared on @entity49 yesterday saying that this was ' poorest advice he could give anyone ' as shotguns only hold two rounds			2
advice : the vice president said that he has told his wife , @entity27 : ' @entity28 , if there ¿ s ever a problem , just walk out on the balcony , put that double - barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house			1
' @entity19 says that , hypothetically , once @entity3 's wife gone out into plain sight and fired these two shots , she would then be a ' sitting duck			2
' the woman then added that the vice president 's suggestion ' comes off a little sexist			1
' ' like , " let me tell you what you need " versus , you know , " arm yourself or protect yourself in a way that you feel necessary , " ' @entity19 said			0
as it happens , the vice president 's advice could also land his wife behind bars			2
as reported by @entity80 , in @entity81 , where the @entity82 live , it is illegal to fire a gun unless the situation is genuinely dangerous			0
a delaware police sergeant told @entity80 that residents are not allowed to shoot trespassers			0
' on your property you ca n't just shoot someone , ' he said			0
' you have to really feel that your life is being threatened			0

@entity10 asked vice president about gun control during online chat
@entity3 told her she did n't need a ar - 15 rifle and ' buy a shotgun ' instead
@entity19 said yesterday she felt his words were ' sexist '
