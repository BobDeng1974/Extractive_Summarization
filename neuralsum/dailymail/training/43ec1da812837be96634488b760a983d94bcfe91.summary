by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 08:15 est , 15 january 2013 a prototype ‘ bouncy ’ space module is to be tested aboard the @entity4 , @entity1 has announced			1
the inflatable module is being heralded as a key component of future exploration and the development of commercial space travel and research			1
it is designed by @entity12 , based in @entity13 , which has been awarded a $ 17.8 million contract			0
inflatable space modules are intended to provide more room for the astronauts based in them			1
@entity18 , @entity1 ’s deputy administrator , said as she unveiled the contract award that the inflatable module concept is simultaneously cutting edge technology and affordable			1
‘ this partnership agreement for the use of expandable habitats represents a step forward in cutting - edge technology that can allow humans to thrive in space safely and affordably , and heralds important progress in @entity31 commercial space innovation , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity32 is a unique laboratory that enables important discoveries that benefit humanity and vastly increase understanding of how humans can live and work in space for long periods			0
’ part of @entity1 ’s interest in the inflatable technology is prompted by its potential for deep space missions			1
the experimental unit , the @entity45 , is intended to be easily launched because it takes up much less room than conventional space craft yet once in orbit is inflated to be much bigger			1
@entity12 hopes that while providing practical solutions to space research , the modules will also serve as craft that can provide accommodation and working space for astronauts in orbit			1
the inflatable unit seen in comparison to one of the @entity4 modules			1
two or more inflatables could be linked up to provide extra working and living space			0
its stated aim is ‘ to provide affordable options for spaceflight to national space agencies and corporate clients ’			0
previously , the company has launched two other inflatable modules but this is the first time it will be tested as part of a manned craft			1
@entity75 1 was launched in in 2006 and genesis 2 in 2007 , both on @entity79 rockets , and are still in orbit			0
echo 1 , launched in 1960 was the first inflatable space craft			2
the @entity1 communication satelite rose 1,000 miles into space as a balloon			0
it was dubbed a ‘ sateloon ’			0
in 1961 an inflatable space station was proposed and a prototype built by @entity1			2
it was intended to be manned by one or two astronauts but it was never launched			0
with the development of kelvar and other materials , the inflatable concept was revived in the 1990s , with @entity1 creating the @entity95			0
budget cuts meant it was scrapped in 2000			0
each has been tested to ensure a constant temperature and pressure can be maintained within the inflatable hull			2
@entity12 last year announced a link up with the @entity104 company which is working to create @entity106 spacecraft that can carry passengers into space			0
the intention was that @entity104 would transport people into space where they would transfer to orbiting @entity12 inflatables			2
among the potential projects that @entity12 is looking at is building a base on the moon constructed from a series of linked inflatable modules			1
initially it would be expected that inflatable @entity120 bases would be for research but with several companies planning to take tourists into orbit they could eventually be used as ' space hotels ' .			2

inflatable modules hailed as *cheaper* to launch and transport
module to be tested on board @entity4
unit could be used for deep space exploration if tested *successfully*
