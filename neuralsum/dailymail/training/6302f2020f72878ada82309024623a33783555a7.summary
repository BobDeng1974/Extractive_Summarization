by @entity1 reporter thanks to healthier and more active lifestyles , many believe we can reach 90 before being considered old old age begins at 80 â€“ almost 20 years later than previous generations believed			1
thanks to healthier and more active lifestyles , working later in life and more public awareness of the elderly and their needs , older people are staying younger longer			2
more than one in five @entity14 even believe you can reach 90 before you are considered old , a study of 2,000 over- 40s says			1
it found falling asleep while watching tv or reading the paper , becoming forgetful and groaning when you get out of bed show you are getting old			1
saying ' back in my day ' , choosing comfort over style and having an afternoon nap also feature in the top ten			2
a spokesman for the comparison website @entity27 , which commissioned the research , said : ' perceptions of old age have changed a lot over the last few years			0
' there was a time when you were considered old or past it as soon as you retired , but this age has now got much later as we are leading healthier and more active lives well into our 70s			1
' pensioners are no longer seen as people who spend their days sat in their armchair knitting or watching black and white films in the afternoon before a little nap			0
' for many , retirement is the start of a whole new chapter and pensioners are travelling the world , taking up new hobbies and in some cases , leading more active and exciting lifestyles than when they were younger			0
' as well as this , people are working later in life than ever before and even if they do n't feel particularly young or fit , it adds to the illusion that they are still young			0
' but while you might not be ' old ' until much later in life now , it 's important not to put off decisions regarding retirement or later years such as life insurance , wills or pensions			0
' old age might seem far off for most , but it 's better to be prepared now than regret not doing something later on			0
' many put the perception down to figures like the @entity69 , who is still active at the age of 88 eighty - five per cent put this down to people living longer , while almost two thirds think it 's due to pensioners leading more active lifestyles			1
other reasons include working until later in life , leading healthier lifestyles and people being more independent later in life			2
almost one in five even believe it 's because of the number of celebrities and famous figures , such as @entity86 and @entity87 - who are both well into their eighties - still working and in the spotlight .			1

more than 1 in 5 believe you can reach 90 before you *'re* considered old
signs of age include falling asleep watching tv and comfort over style
many say it is down to famous figures like the @entity69 still active late in life
