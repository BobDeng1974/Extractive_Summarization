@entity0 refused to be drawn into a discussion of @entity4 's @entity3 title chances after seeing them hold out to claim a hard - fought victory at @entity7			1
the @entity9 ' sixth successive league win left them just four points behind leaders @entity12 , who have two games in hand , but @entity0 is adopting a one - game - at - a - time approach to the closing stages of the campaign			1
he said : ' look , @entity12 have a good security and at the moment , i feel they have enough cushion to be quite serene			1
@entity0 has played down his side 's chances of winning the @entity3 title this season the @entity4 boss believes @entity12 have too much security at the top and are quite serene ' we have @entity30 in front of us and behind us , it is tight as well - the only thing we can do is to win our games			1
' i think @entity12 have too much security			1
i just think at the moment we are not concluding , we are in a fight			0
you have seen the game today - in every game , we need to turn up and fight until the last minute to get the points			0
' that 's what we have to do , just go for the next game and win it			2
look , the players want to do as well as they can			0
we know we have a fight first to be in the top four			2
we will go step by step , game by game			0
' @entity12 are four points clear of the @entity9 but have two games in hand on the rest of the chasing pack @entity4 looked to be heading for a comfortable victory at @entity59 when @entity60 struck twice inside four first - half minutes to give them a commanding 2 - 0 lead at the break			1
but the @entity63 , who were booed off at half - time , returned in determined mood and @entity67 reduced the deficit within three minutes of the restart			0
they then laid siege to the @entity9 ' goal and but for fine reaction saves by @entity74 from @entity75 and @entity76 , they might have emerged with something to show for their efforts			0
@entity60 ( centre right ) pokes home the opener in an entertaining affair at @entity59 @entity0 said : ' we have played four games in two weeks and three away games at @entity85 , in @entity86 and here today and we have won all the three			1
' the last 40 minutes were difficult because our legs had gone a little bit and @entity7 played very well in the second half			1
' but we had an outstanding first half going forward and a very fluent game by creating chance after chance , and in the second half , we had just to show different qualities and hang on			0
' the in - form striker bagged a second from a corner to put @entity4 into a commanding half - time lead but @entity7 head coach @entity100 , who had only one fit central defender for the game , was also able to take positives from a spirited fightback which he felt demonstrated the fact that his players have not started their summer holiday just yet			1
@entity100 said : ' there certainly was n't anyone on the beach with their flip - flops on , that 's for sure			2
' after the comments last week , which were ridiculous , from ex-players - i 'm surprised at that - every single one of them , and i include the lads who came on the pitch as second - half substitutes , gave everything for this football club			0
' it showed that they are not on their holidays yet			0
' that barb was aimed in the direction of @entity130 pundit @entity129 after his comments last sunday night , although the former @entity133 and @entity134 man tweeted during the second half : ' @entity7 been brilliant 2nd half so far ! '			2
@entity67 ( right ) halved the deficit but despite late pressure @entity7 's poor start punished them when informed , @entity100 said : ' that 's nice , i did n't realise that had happened			1
' defeat , coupled with @entity144 's 2 - 1 victory at @entity145 , saw @entity146 's @entity144 leapfrog the @entity63 into 11th place , although the former @entity63 manager 's progress was of little concern to @entity100			2
he said : ' i 've got to be honest , it is because of the situation we are in			0
congratulations to @entity146 , but i am not worried about @entity144			0
' the only thing that 's on my mind and the only thing i 'm worried about is this football club and making sure everything i do is 100 per cent , everything the players do and give is 100 per cent , and that 's all i can ask for			2

@entity0 played down @entity4 's hopes of a title *challenge*
the @entity166 thinks @entity12 ' have too much security ' at the top
