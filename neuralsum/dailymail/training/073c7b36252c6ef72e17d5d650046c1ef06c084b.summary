it 's a mystery that has confounded military experts around the world for years			1
the top - secret @entity4 space drone , which landed in @entity5 on friday , has spent nearly two years orbiting @entity6 on a classified mission			1
theories have ranged from it being a space bomber ready to attack in a matter of hours , to a clandestine probe on a mission to ' take out ' spy satellites			1
' the @entity24 government has a bottomless appetite for sensitive information , ' said @entity28 , a secrecy expert at the @entity29			1
' as powerful as our intelligence satellites may be , they also have their limitations - most notably the limitations imposed by their orbital parameters			1
' it 's conceivable that a spy plane would introduce new versatility into overhead reconnaissance			1
' the usual suspects would be targets			0
for instance , @entity41 or @entity42 , or the various battle zones in the @entity44 and elsewhere			1
' an infrared view of the @entity4 unmanned spacecraft landing at @entity18			0
the purpose of the @entity24 military 's space plane is classified , only fueling speculation about why it has been orbiting @entity6 for nearly two years on this , its third mission one leading secrecy expert has told @entity21 that the drone ( artist 's impression pictured ) is ' very likely ' to be a @entity24 spy plane			1
earlier this year , the editor of @entity59 claimed the space plane was spying on the @entity62 space station earlier this year , the editor of @entity59 claimed the space plane was spying on the @entity62 space station , arguing that the orbit of the @entity4 was close to that of the @entity67 centre			2
the @entity69 's unmanned @entity4 space plane has flown three secret missions to date			2
each time it has carried a mystery payload on long - duration flights in @entity6 orbit			0
the spacecraft looks similar to @entity77 's space shuttle but is much smaller			2
the @entity4 is about 29ft ( 8.8m ) long and 9.5ft ( 2.9 m ) tall			0
it has a wingspan of just less than 15ft ( 4.6 m )			0
at launch , it weighs 11,000lbs ( 4,990kg )			0
the craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to @entity6			1
but @entity84 , a former @entity69 officer who worked at @entity86 's @entity85 , pointed out that @entity4 could n't keep a constant eye on the @entity62 space station			2
' even though there may be a brief chance at some point for the @entity4 to collect intelligence [ on the @entity62 space station ] , that certainly is not the main mission , or even something all that feasible , ' said			2
other theories sound straight out of a @entity97 film , including that the spacecraft would be able to capture the satellites of other nations			1
a space bomber that can attack anywhere in the world within a matter of hours has also been put forward by conspiracy theorists			1
' of all the possibilities , that strikes me as probably the least likely because it 's the least necessary , ' said mr @entity28			1
' the @entity24 military has global reach without it			0
' the @entity4 space drone , otherwise known as the @entity113 , has been in flight since december 2012 on a secret mission			2
like a shuttle , @entity4 is blasted into orbit by a rocket			0
however , it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft			0
the @entity4 is too small to carry people onboard , but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck , which is just large enough to carry a small satellite the space plane is a spy plane : the leading theory appears to be that the unmanned space plane is a shuttle - shaped surveillance vehicle			1
it could be a space bomber : this is the least likely theory , according tot @entity133 , a secrecy expert at the @entity29			1
he claims the @entity24 does n't need this capability			2
it is on a mission is to ' take out ' satellites : this activity would be easily traceable , making it unlikely to stay a secret			2
the @entity4 deploys spy satellites : instead of destroying them , the theory suggests that the space plane 's orbit matches up to where deployed satellites would work best for spying on other countries			1
the @entity152 has bounced between several federal agencies , @entity77 among them , since 1999			0
the plane has been in space for a total of 674 days , far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days			1
the program 's first mission launched in april 2010 and landed in december that year			0
the second space plane took off on march 2011 and came back to @entity6 in june 2012			2
according to @entity4 manufacturer @entity162 , the space plane operates in low - earth orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth			0
by comparison , the @entity165 orbits at about 220 miles			0
both top secret missions ended at @entity168 , but this may soon change as @entity162 , which built the shuttles , is working to renovate a @entity77 hangar at the @entity172 , which could become @entity4 's new home			0
this december 3 , 2010 , file image provided by the @entity18 shows technicians examining the @entity4 unmanned spaceplane shortly after landing at @entity18 , @entity5 @entity77 last week said it has entered into an agreement with the @entity69 's @entity4 program for use of the @entity172 's @entity180 ( @entity180 ) bays 1 and 2 - former space shuttle hangars			1
@entity162 is performing construction upgrades in those facilities that are targeted to be complete in december			0
all missions so far have launched from @entity185 , @entity186			0
while the airplane looks like @entity77 's retired space shuttles , it has its own identity			0
like a shuttle , it is blasted into orbit by a rocket			0
however , it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft			0
the @entity4 is too small to carry people onboard , but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck , which is just large enough to carry a small satellite			0
' it 's misleading , the idea that secret programmes like this have achieved important technological breakthroughs â€“ it 's a seductive idea but misleading , ' mr @entity28 told @entity21			1
' based on experience of past programmes , this craft has gone far beyond the secret programme stage , it 's existence is now an acknowledged fact , ' some sort of explanation of its function is likely to come , if not this year , then i guess within five years			1

craft has been in space for 674 days and *returned* to @entity5 on friday
theories range from it being a space bomber to destroying spy satellites
@entity28 , a secrecy expert , said the most likely explanation is that it is being used to spy on countries such as @entity41 and @entity42
he claims the reason behind its existence will be revealed within five years
