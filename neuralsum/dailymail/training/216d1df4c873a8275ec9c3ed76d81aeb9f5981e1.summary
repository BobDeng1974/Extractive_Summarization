it took only one ball of the first one - day international against @entity2 on friday for @entity3 to be handed a rude reminder of the size of the task that awaits them here in the tri-series and the @entity9 that follows			1
once @entity10 , who made 187 just two days ago , was trapped lbw by a rapid @entity11 at the @entity12 , much of the optimism @entity3 garnered from two near perfect warm - up performances began to evaporate			1
when @entity16 followed two balls later and @entity3 then crashed to 33 for four it seemed as though this was simply a continuation of the @entity21 tour from hell that reached its nadir on this same famous old ground a year ago			2
@entity10 ( left ) was dismissed off the bowling of @entity11 ( centre ) in the first ball of the match @entity29 ( second left ) celebrates taking the wicket of @entity31 , who was caught behind @entity32 ( left ) appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of @entity34 , who went on to reach a century thank heavens then for @entity37 who made a welcome return to form and once again appeared galvanised by high office as he single - handedly saved @entity3 from one of the total humiliations common place here last winter			1
yet a century from the new @entity3 one - day captain that augers well for the battles ahead was never going to be enough to stop @entity2 showing that they will be very much the team to beat in the @entity9 that begins next month			2
once @entity34 got in the groove that tormented @entity3 all too often during the 5 - 0 thrashing @entity2 ’s domination was clear against an attack worryingly lacking in variation and incapable of defending a sub-standard 234			1
as it was , @entity2 cruised to a win so comfortable they were able to gain a bonus point and demonstrated that they remain a formidable one - day machine even without injured captain @entity56 and the rested @entity57			0
@entity37 , @entity3 's one - day captain , top scored for the visitors with 121 runs against @entity2 @entity34 bats during the opening match of the @entity62 between @entity2 and @entity3 @entity34 and @entity64 ( right ) , @entity2 's opening batsman against @entity3 , take to the field on friday back to the drawing board ? not really , because @entity3 were always likely to be a one - day work in progress here with only a puncher ’s chance of competing for a tri-series that also includes @entity72 and the premier 50 - overs tournament			1
yet they will want to do much better than this , starting when they meet that other one - day powerhouse in @entity72 in @entity78 on tuesday and then when they face @entity2 yet again in @entity79 next friday			0
it was somehow inevitable that @entity10 would fail here after showing against a @entity82 that he can produce the type of dynamic , substantial innings that has been beyond so many englishmen in 50 - over cricket			0
@entity3 may have breathed a sigh of relief that they did not have to face @entity57 here but instead came another left - arm bowler with the pace , hostility and skill to rip the heart out of their innings before it had barely begun			0
@entity3 's @entity98 ( third left ) celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity102 ( left ) @entity37 proved his worth as @entity3 's one - day captain when he came in at five to top score for the visitors @entity107 ( right ) plays a sweep shot on his way to 13 runs off 18 balls for @entity3 against @entity2 @entity11 appears to have added the priceless ability to swing the ball back into right - handers to his armoury and here he was simply too quick for both @entity10 and @entity16 as @entity3 made the worst possible start to their busiest ever year			1
there was a suspicion that @entity10 may have got an inside edge onto his pad but the replays were inconclusive and not even the @entity122 that will not be used in this tri-series at @entity72 ’s insistence would have saved him			0
by the time @entity37 came to the crease @entity3 were in disarray – welcome to the captaincy , @entity127 – but at least he was able to steady his ship and hit his first century since this time last year in @entity78			2
no - one else had an answer to @entity11 , the equally rapid @entity29 , the left - arm variations of @entity134 and even the mediocre spinner in @entity136 who @entity3 were unable to attack			0
@entity137 , @entity2 's number three , plays a shot ... he eventually scored 16 runs off 20 balls for the hosts @entity143 watches on as his shot flies away towards the boundary at the @entity12 @entity37 leads the @entity3 players on to the field as a @entity148 flies in the background when @entity150 hung around with his captain long enough to add 56 for the eighth wicket @entity3 at least looked like they would reach the relative riches of 250 and give themselves something to bowl at			1
but @entity11 returned to dismiss @entity37 for 121 and last man @entity158 in successive balls and @entity3 had wasted 13 deliveries after being bowled out within 50 overs for the 10th time in their last 13 one - day internationals			1
where @entity2 have plenty of bowling options @entity37 had no choice other than to rely an attack lacking a left - armer of his own and even their main one - day spinner in @entity173 , surprisingly left out on a worn @entity12 pitch			1
@entity34 ’s one - day record pales into insignificance compared to his @entity178 and @entity179 statistics but he loves being a thorn in @entity3 ’s side and once he had negotiated the two new balls there was absolutely no shifting him			2
@entity37 gathered his @entity3 squad together to give a team - talk before they took to the field fans dressed up in the sun to enjoy the @entity190 match of @entity2 against @entity3 a view of the @entity192 and @entity193 shows the ground bathed in sunshine on friday @entity3 left out @entity196 to give him more time to recover from his knee problem but in his place @entity158 was again a shadow of the bowler who looked among the best one - day performers in the world in @entity204 in 2013			1
clearly the problems that led to @entity158 being sent home from the @entity21 tour with his action in disarray have not totally been solved yet and @entity158 did well to escape injury when he clattered into the stumps after losing his footing			0
the much improved @entity98 was quicker than @entity158 and provided encouragement with four wickets but the decision to keep @entity217 away from the new balls suggests he too has not fully recovered from knee surgery			0
the end came with more than 10 overs to spare but only three wickets in hand after @entity34 , who could have been given out lbw to @entity225 on 51 , had been dismissed for 127 within sight of the winning post			2
@entity3 will hope @entity2 prove just as difficult to beat when they face @entity72 in @entity229 on sunday , leaving them to battle it out with @entity232 ’s side for a place in the final			0
yes , this is a reality check but it was always expecting a lot for @entity3 to hit the ground running against @entity2 in this series			0
at least @entity37 , who must have a good @entity9 for @entity3 to have any chance , is back in business .			0

@entity3 won the toss and opted to bat first against @entity2 in @entity12
it started *bad*ly for the tourists as @entity10 was bowled with the first delivery
and it went from *bad* to worse as @entity16 was given out lbw after the third ball , leaving @entity3 struggling on 0 - 2
@entity37 came in with @entity3 on 12 - 3 , and top scored with 121
@entity3 posted *243* all out in just *shy* of 48 overs against @entity2
@entity2 opener @entity34 *impressed* as he raced to a century
@entity34 top scored with 127 before being caught by @entity10 late on
@entity2 *confirmed* the *victory* with *61* balls remaining in the innings
