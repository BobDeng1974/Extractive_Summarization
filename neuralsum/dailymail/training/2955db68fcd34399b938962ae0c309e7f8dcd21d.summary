@entity0 was @entity18 ’s assistant at @entity19 when @entity6 was a teenager unafraid to make his presence felt on the training pitches			2
at @entity25 , his attempt to win possession three minutes after the break went wrong and instead he left his studs on @entity17 ’s ankle			1

‘ sometimes players can make three or four fouls and only get yellow , then @entity6 makes one tackle that looks a little bit dangerous : boom , he gets a red			2
‘ saying that , if you stop the video you will see his studs in his ankle			0
another three inches it could be a broken leg			0
i think that ’s why the referee gave it , but sometimes you get away with those			0
‘ i was at @entity19 with him			0
i can tell you @entity18 received a few from @entity108			0
i feel sad for him today			0
i think he did n’t deserve that			0
it was a little bit dangerous and we need to be fair with the referee as well			0
’ @entity6 ’s dismissal gave @entity12 an opportunity to snatch three points from a dire game of little quality			1
but even though @entity17 hit the post late on with a driven shot , it was @entity9 with the better chances to win the game			1
‘ we tried too hard , went a little bit crazy , ’ explained @entity0			0
@entity62 ’s side are well - versed this season in playing a man light			1

that red was later rescinded and @entity62 said he would view video footage before deciding whether to appeal against @entity6 ’s red too			1
@entity9 limited @entity12 to scant openings , the clearest coming in the 68th minute when @entity69 crossed for @entity71			1
the @entity164 ’s attempt was blocked by his team - mate @entity35 , who reacted by backheeling a shot that required @entity168 to block near the line			2
@entity62 sent on @entity170 to provide some much - needed pace and the 19 - year - old made the kind of impact that may see him get more minutes against @entity175 on @entity176			1
he fired a shot narrowly wide , nearly forced an own goal from @entity63 and whipped a corner that @entity48 met with a glancing header to test @entity42			2
@entity62 appealed enthusiastically for a penalty in added time when @entity42 collided with @entity41 but @entity28 , on this occasion , was unmoved			1
