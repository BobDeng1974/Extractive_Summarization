this troupe of @entity6 re-enactors turned heads outside @entity8 today in honour of @entity10 , who had his cut off 366 years ago			2
his execution , seven years into a war between royalists and parliamentarians who claimed @entity10 had committed ' wicked ' abuses of power , crushed the idea of an all - powerful king - though the monarchy was restored just 11 years			0
riding horses and wearing armour and uniforms typical of the time , the @entity22 played the part of the royalist @entity27 in a ceremony which has been carried out annually since 1951			2
they retraced the king 's short final journey from @entity32 in central @entity33 to the @entity34 in @entity35 , where crowds groaned with discomfort as his head was chopped off in one clean stroke on a raised scaffold			1
thankfully for the witnesses today , there was no beheading			0
instead the volunteers laid a simple wreath at the spot where the king was ' martyred ' more than three centuries ago			0
history : tourists and @entity51 at @entity8 did a double - take today as @entity6 re-enactors marched on horseback in @entity52			0
