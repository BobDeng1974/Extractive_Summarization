they have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years , but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades			1
@entity7 , a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company @entity9 , claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s			1
he said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in @entity14			1
the ' extender stick ' , as he called it , was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time			1
whether taking in a spectacular panorama , visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert ; the chances are your view has been ruined by a selfie stick on at least one occasion			1
now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse , because there ’s a next - generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone			1
the contraption lets selfie addicts take photos of themselves using their @entity49 , ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots			0
the supersized stick is available on the website accessory geeks for just $ 23 ( £ 16 ) , suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon			1
he added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing			1
despite being patented in 1983 , the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured			1
but that did not stop mr @entity7 from compiling a family album of family ' selfies ' using his device			1
speaking to the @entity73 , he said : ' the idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then			2
' the philosophy behind it was that i did n't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - i could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever i liked			0
' some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings			0
they have become such a menace that many tourist venues , museums , concert venues and stadiums have banned them			0
perhaps ironically , @entity95 - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference			1
mr @entity7 used his ' extender stick ' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in @entity14 ( above ) modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video			1
mr @entity7 's patent ran out in 2003 , however , so he has not benefited from the recent boom			1
instead @entity117 inventor @entity116 developed a hand - held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s , which he called the @entity119			2
while his product has sold well , there are many others available			0
mr @entity7 said : ' my idea came too early , but that 's just one of those things			1
' i patented about 300 ideas , so that was just one of them			2
we call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early			2
' the idea of selfies , however , is not new			2
remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades			2
a recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera			2
@entity148 , director - general of the @entity149 , said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s			0
selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them			0
but a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use			0
last month the @entity166 in @entity167 became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome			0
it follows bans in galleries in @entity174 and @entity175 – including the @entity176 and the @entity177 in @entity178			0
organisers of two major @entity175 festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks			0
the @entity183 and @entity184 are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds			0
according to @entity193 , @entity167 's @entity191 and @entity192 have also prohibited them , while @entity196 's @entity195 also do not permit the use of the gadgets			0
banned : the @entity183 and @entity184 , in @entity199 and @entity200 , are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban selfie sticks on their grounds ( file picture )			0

@entity7 patented the ' extender stick ' at camera firm @entity9 in 1983
he came up with the invention after struggling to find anyone to take pictures of him with his wife while they were on a family holiday in @entity14
it used a mirror on the front of compact cameras to help the photographer
but the idea was not a *commercial* success and the patent ran out in 2003
