when the @entity6 's @entity22 began the process of filing criminal charges , however , it found that the agency had destroyed her computer 's hard drive before it could be seized			1
april @entity28 said during a september 2012 @entity30 video chat , while working for the @entity6 , that @entity32 's presidential campaign lacked ' a unified message , ' and claimed ' there 's nothing that they can focus on with respect to the economy or anything else ' in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign , the @entity6 lawyer declared that only ' straight white men ' ought to vote for the @entity0 @entity43 , a former @entity44 official who once mentored april sands at the @entity6 , landed in the middle of a lost - emails scandal after the @entity44 told @entity49 it had recycled a hard drive containing evidence needed to prosecute her @entity43 , a former @entity44 official at the center of an alleged years - long plot to politically target tea party groups and other conservative organizations , also has seen her legal picture brightened by the @entity44 's decision to render the hard drive in her government - issued computer into scrap metal			1
@entity43 , whose missing emails have made her a political lightning rod , was @entity28 ' supervisor until 2001			2
@entity6 documents indicate that as the agency 's acting general counsel , @entity43 oversaw the younger attorney 's work			1
following an investigation into her partisan political activity , @entity9 admitted to the @entity6 's @entity72 that she had violated the @entity73 , a federal law banning partisan politicking by most government employees , and agreed not to seek employment in the federal government for two years			1
the special counsel wrote that she had ' posted dozens of partisan political tweets , including many soliciting campaign contributions to president @entity2 ’s 2012 reelection campaign			1
' she also ' participated in a @entity86 internet broadcast via webcam from an @entity6 facility , criticizing the @entity0 and then - presidential candidate @entity32			2
' an @entity6 attorney who is still employed by the agency told @entity91 on monday that @entity9 was known in the agency as ' the most enthusiastic pro-obama lawyer we had			1
' ' everyone called her @entity2 girl , ' said the lawyer , who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the record			1
' she probably did n't worry about seeming too rah - rah and running afoul of the law , ' he added , ' because she bragged to anyone who would listen that the @entity2 2012 campaign was going to hire her away from the @entity6			1
' the attorney also said that @entity9 and @entity43 ' were definitely acquainted with each other ' when the two worked together in the agency 's office of general counsel			1
' there were two mid-level associates that @entity43 latched on to at the time , ' he recalled , ' and one of them was april			1

april @entity9 was a @entity6 lawyer before she resigned this year and accepted a ban on holding government jobs until 2016
she was former @entity44 official @entity43 's *deputy* when she was at the @entity6
like the allegations against @entity43 , @entity9 admitted violating the @entity73 , which *prohibits* government workers from advocating for candidates
and as seems to be the case with @entity43 , @entity9 escaped prosecution because her hard drive *mysteriously* ' *crashed* ' and was recycled
she was known as ' @entity2 girl ' in her office , and a colleague recalled how she boasted that @entity2 's 2012 campaign would hire her away
