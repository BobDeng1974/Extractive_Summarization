an @entity1 geologist claims he has ‘ confirmed ’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to @entity5 and his son in @entity7			1
after extensive chemical tests , dr @entity8 says he has linked the @entity10 – a 1st - century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of @entity5 ' brother – to the long disputed ‘ @entity14 ’ in the city ’s @entity16 neighbourhood			1
the research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that @entity5 was married , fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place			1
dr @entity8 ’s work has renewed controversy over the @entity16 tomb , which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the @entity39 period and the time of @entity5 , the @entity34 reported			2
bones were discovered inside ossuaries , including one that bore the inscription , ‘ @entity5 , son of @entity46 '			1
others included the names @entity49 , @entity46 , @entity33 , @entity50 , @entity51 and most controversially , ‘ @entity30 , son of @entity5 ’			1
@entity46 , @entity33 and @entity5 were all common names at the time and a statistician from the @entity55 said that they each made up eight per cent of the population			1
however , a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the @entity60			0
dr @entity8 ’s work has renewed the controversy over the @entity16 tomb , which was found in 1980 and dates back to the @entity39 period and the time of @entity5 ( a portrait is pictured ) the long - disputed long disputed ‘ @entity14 ’ in the city ’s @entity16 neighbourhood ( marked ) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago probing this connection , dr @entity8 and documentary maker @entity68 looked closer at the ossuaries , including the @entity10 , which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription , ‘ @entity74 , son of @entity46 , brother of @entity5 ’			1
the @entity10 is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead			1
but it stands out because it bears the inscription ' @entity74 , son of @entity46 , brother of @entity5 ' on one side			1
the inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of @entity5 , the existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002 , but its authenticity was immediately challenged			1
the box 's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later , the judge said the acquittal ' does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago '			2
now , dr @entity8 claims the chemical signature on the ‘ crust ’ of the box matches that of a tomb in @entity7 known as the ‘ @entity14 ’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of @entity5 and @entity33 as well as ‘ @entity30 , son of @entity5 ’			1
the owner of the ossuary , @entity103 , was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the @entity108 in @entity109 , but he was later found innocent			0
other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the @entity7 tomb is connected with @entity5 at all			1
recently dr @entity8 gained access to the @entity10 and scraped beneath the box 's patina , the layer that forms on metal over time			2
he ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium , iron and silicon from the @entity10 matched the chemical signature of @entity16 tomb			1
the @entity16 ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘ @entity137 ’ soil , which is characteristic of the hills of @entity7 when they were found and has a unique chemistry			1
dr @entity8 worked from the assumption that an earthquake of @entity140 flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries , effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time			0
soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the @entity16 ossuaries , indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘ holy ’ location			1
bones were discovered there in ossuaries , or chalk boxes , including one that bears the inscription , ‘ @entity5 , son of @entity46 ' with others bearing the names of @entity49 , @entity46 , @entity33 , @entity50 , @entity51 and most controversially , ‘ @entity30 , son of @entity5 ’			1
here an inscription that says ' @entity161 ' on an ossuary because bones were found in the ossuaries , it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection ( portrayed in this tapestry ) which is the belief of more traditional @entity170 , while others accept the event was spiritual @entity5 was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist			1
@entity180 , a @entity181 based author , believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves @entity5 did not exist			2
he claims there are no contemporary mentions of @entity5 in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived , yet other @entity188 sect leaders from the time do appear			2
@entity5 was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist			2
a mosaic of @entity5 is shown he also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of @entity197 , @entity51 and @entity198 , claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of @entity5			2
instead he insists the disciples of @entity5 were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence			2
speaking to @entity205 , he said : ' there is a paradox that @entity5 did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years			2
' or it means he did n't do all these things at all			0
' the first gospel of @entity170 appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray			0
' i believe that @entity170 started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old gods and old traditions were rebooted			0
' @entity170 appears to have been a @entity188 mystery faith			0
@entity180 told @entity205 : ' there is a paradox that @entity5 did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years '			0
the famous statue of @entity230 in @entity231 , @entity232 , is shown ' by the time of @entity235 there appears to have been plenty of different " lord 's suppers " as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs			0
' it appears that early @entity170 managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of @entity5			0
' mr @entity180 said : ' there is nothing implausible to think that @entity5 was a real person , but i just do n't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all			0
' we also have no mention of @entity5 in other historical texts from the time			0
there were certainly people writing about @entity254 at the time like @entity256			0
' during this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than @entity5 , but all of them managed something @entity5 did not - to make a dent on the historical record			0
' two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did			0
' @entity68 told the @entity34 : ‘ this find illustrates that the @entity10 is authentic and the @entity272 tomb indeed belongs to the family of @entity5			1
’ dr @entity274 told the @entity275 : ‘ i think i ’ve got really powerful , virtually unequivocal evidence that the @entity10 spent most of its lifetime , or death time , in the @entity279			1
’ the retired senior researchers of the @entity281 of @entity1 , added : ‘ the evidence is beyond what i expected			0
’ the duo are aware that the findings could rock the @entity286 , but insist the research is scientific and not theological			0
because bones were found in the ossuaries , it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection , which is the belief of more traditional @entity170 , while others accept the event was spiritual			0
the @entity16 tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab , while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the @entity300			0
the @entity10 is kept in a secret location by its owner , who lives in @entity303 .			0

geologist ran 150 chemical tests on ossuaries and ' @entity14 '
claims chemical signature proves @entity10 was at @entity7 site
chalk box bears inscription ‘ @entity74 , son of @entity46 , brother of @entity5 ’
find suggests @entity5 fathered a child and was married
