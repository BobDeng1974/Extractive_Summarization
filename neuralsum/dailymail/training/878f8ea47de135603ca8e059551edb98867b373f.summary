@entity11 understands that @entity2 , 20 , is being monitored closely by @entity13 scouts and could be part of @entity16 ’s squad to face @entity17 and @entity18 in september if he maintains his remarkable progress			1
@entity2 , who grew up in @entity20 in @entity21 , is yet to represent his country at youth level and a call - up by @entity16 next month would cap a remarkable rise for the young left back			2
@entity7 ambitions : @entity2 is in line for a call up to the @entity29 showing promise : @entity2 looked good on @entity3 's tour of the @entity32 which has boosted his international hopes only two years ago , @entity2 ’ career in @entity36 football looked to be under threat when he was released by @entity38 as an 18 - year - old but the player was handed a lifeline by @entity3 ’s reserve team manager @entity42			1
