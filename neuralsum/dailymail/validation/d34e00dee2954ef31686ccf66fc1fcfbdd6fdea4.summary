the raiders did not appear to be armed when they stormed the historic venue			1
one resident , who asked not to be named , said : ' masked men ran into the club and we then saw lots of customers , half - naked or wrapped in towels , pouring out into the street			1
' residents feel the club is potentially attracting a criminal element to the area			1
' it 's not what people had in mind when they settled here			0
' we feel the planning application for a private members ' club was a very clever one in that those who even knew about it did not realise it would be a swingers ' club			1
' it seems to be busy most nights and saturday night particularly so			0
' residents are now having problems parking their own cars , there have been some incidents of parking rows with visitors to the club			1
' there 's been some lewd behaviour in the area around the club , people coming out kissing and all over one another			1
' there 's been a lot of occasions where cars of men are cruising around			2
' a lot of young girls live close by and parents are worried their children could be propositioned			0
' there 's also concern about property values going down			0
' @entity92 confirmed they are investigating the raid where one man was punched in the head a woman , not pictured here , was pushed to the ground but was fortunately uninjured by her shocking ordeal the club features several bedrooms and @entity103 - style baths which can be shared by several people the @entity105 revealed in january how @entity11 had been converted into the swingers club			1
and earlier this month the council told the tenants to carry on swinging after concluding no planning breaches had taken place			0
but the violent raid has renewed opposition to @entity10			2
locals are now planning a petition claiming they were not consulted properly about the club , which is sited near @entity117 grounds , a park and homes			1
the resident added : ' we know this kind of club exists all over the country but think it should not be based in a residential area			2
' it should be in or close to the city centre			0
' the applicant 's temporary planning application , granted by the council , also stated that he was allowed a maximum of 50 people in the club but there are times when there are more than 100 cars parked around the club , cars which do n't belong to residents			2
' locals in @entity4 want the club , which has communal showers , to closed down residents have been petitioning @entity38 to strip the club of its operating licence the club even features its own dungeon where people can tie each other up and enjoy unusual activities a spokeswoman for @entity92 said : ' police are investigating after masked raiders gained entry to a private function at the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity12 , at 9.35pm on march 18			1
' three men wearing ski masks were seen in the corridor			2
' one man , aged 53 , was punched in the head , resulting in him falling to the floor			1

another woman was pushed , but not injured			1
' no weapons were seen			0
the men then left the building			1
' police inquiries are on - going into the incident			2
no arrests have been made at this stage			0
' the @entity105 previously told how the timber - framed property - an ancient monument - had been transformed into a club for swingers and fetish fans , complete with a dungeon			1
the building was officially advertised online under the name @entity10 after its current tenants signed a ten - year lease with property owner , @entity190 , last march			2
the city council granted temporary change of use planning permission for ' the private members meeting venue ' last year and had claimed no complaints had been raised at the time			0
earlier this month a city council spokesman said : ' officers visited the @entity10 on january 29 , 2015 to establish whether any licensable activities took place at this venue			0
' they found its bar operates on a ' bring your own drinks ' basis - the drinks featured in photos of the bar area were actually coloured water and cooking oil			0
' also the club appears to be set up for participation , rather than the presentation of any performance for an audience which might require an entertainment licence			0
' at present there is no justification for revisiting the premises , but if officers receive new intelligence regarding activities at this venue this position may be reviewed			0
' the @entity10 website , featuring pictures of scantily - clad women , has boasted of being the @entity232 's most exclusive swingers venue			0
' the building has been fully refurbished with only one thing in mind - your pleasure and enjoyment , ' it said			0
when previously asked about complaints about the property 's current use , a spokesman for the club said : ' people should mind their own business			0
' we are consenting adults			0
