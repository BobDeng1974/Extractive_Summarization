a farmer has lost a nine - year legal battle to save the dream home he built without planning permission and hid behind hay bales for four years			1
@entity5 , 66 , secretly constructed the mock - @entity7 castle complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002			1
he unveiled it officially in 2006 when he thought he would be able to exploit a legal loophole that prevents enforcement action against a structure if no objections have been made for at least four years			1
now , after numerous court appearances costing tens of thousands of pounds , @entity29 secretary @entity28 has finally ruled the four - bedroom home on @entity32 land at @entity33 in @entity20 , @entity21 – worth well in excess of £ 1million if sold on the open market - must be pulled down within 90 days			1
mr @entity5 yesterday compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work			2
‘ it would be like @entity41 being asked to rip up his masterpiece of an oil painting or something for me to demolish it , ’ he complained			2
he added : ‘ i do n’t think i have any choice , to be honest			0
what they ’re saying now is if i do n’t demolish it in 90 days they ’ll put me in prison			2
’ mr @entity5 started as a tenant farmer at @entity54 in the 1970s and bought the farmyard and ten acres of land in 1985			2
there was no farmhouse , however , so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of £ 50,000			1
features include weathered brick and stone , carved wooden pillars and beams and a stained - glass dome above the stairwell			0
the 66 - year - old used dozens of hay bales , blue tarpaulin and tyres to hide the house ( above ) from 2002 to 2006 mr @entity5 , pictured ( above ) outside the house , compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work mr @entity5 and his wife , @entity78 , went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son @entity82 , now 14 , off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes			1
‘ we could n’t have him drawing a big blue haystack – people might have asked questions , ’ mrs @entity88 explained previously			0
@entity93 expressed anger at the brazenness of the plan when the property ’s existence was declared			0
one said : ‘ it was a complete shock when the hay came down and this castle was in its place			2
everyone else has to abide by planning laws , so why should n’t they ? ’ @entity106 and @entity107 served an enforcement notice requiring it be razed to the ground , claiming the four - year period after which the building would be allowed to stay was void as no one had been able to see it			1
mr @entity5 , who has five children from a previous marriage , appealed to the @entity116 which found in favour of the council because the property had not been ‘ substantially complete ’ for the four years required			1
mr @entity5 and his wife , @entity78 ( above ) , went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son @entity82 , now 14 , off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes the four - bedroom house , complete with chandeliers , would be worth well in excess of £ 1million if sold on the open market - but it must be pulled down within 90 days features include weathered brick and stone , carved wooden pillars and beams , and a stained - glass dome above the stairwell this was a reference to the bales and tarpaulins that had been used to conceal it , meaning the project had effectively continued after 2002			1
the farmer then took his case to the @entity145 in 2009 and to the @entity146 the following year , both of which dismissed his challenge			0
further delays were caused when he submitted applications for the house to be retained for agricultural use			0
he claimed it was needed to provide accommodation for a worker in connection with a beef farming business on the site			0
these were rejected by the @entity116 last year but another appeal was heard in a @entity160 before @entity28 , the secretary of state for communities and local government , intervened and dismissed the claim , which raised ‘ important or novel issues of development control and / or legal difficulties			0
’ a council spokesman yesterday said it had a ‘ duty ’ to uphold planning rules designed to protect the @entity32			0
he added : ‘ the secretary of state ’s decision demonstrates that people who ignore planning rules for the good of everyone are likely to find themselves in this unfortunate position			0

@entity5 has lived in castle in @entity20 , @entity21 , since 2002 with family
used bales of hay to *disguise* the building before unveiling it in 2006
tried to exploit loophole that allows building if no complaints for four years
66 - year - old must now demolish the four - bedroom house worth £ 1million
