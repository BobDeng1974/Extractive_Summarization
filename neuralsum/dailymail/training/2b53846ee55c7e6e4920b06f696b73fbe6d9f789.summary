a television advert for the @entity8 mail order company has been seen as hinting that @entity9 does not exist			1
it features children in a @entity9 play who sing about who has bought their presents , with a chorus which says their mothers have done all the shopping			0
many of the complaints called for the 40 - second advert to be rescheduled to a time slot after youngsters have gone to bed			1
and a @entity45 petition has been launched demanding it is taken off the air altogether			1
one parent said : ‘ thanks , @entity8 for letting the magic of @entity4 be trashed			2
’ fury : hundreds of viewers have complained to the @entity32 about the advert , saying it has caused their children distress by revealing that @entity9 does not exist another said : ‘ it has upset a lot of parents new and experienced			1
children have been coming to their parents asking them why @entity4 does n’t come on christmas eve to deliver the presents			0
’ the advert has also been criticised for encouraging parents to spend too much on @entity9 gifts			0
it shows ‘ muvver ’ using her credit card to pay for luxury goods that she otherwise might not be able to afford			1
a further @entity45 posting said : ‘ this ad should be banned			1
shame on you @entity8 , especially as we are going through tough times			2
putting such pressure on parents who struggle as it is to keep jobs and make ends meet			0
’ hundreds more people have signed a @entity45 page petitioning for the ad to be scrapped the @entity32 said its council had decided ‘ after careful consideration that , as the ad did not make reference to @entity9 or suggest @entity9 did not exist , it was unlikely to cause distress to children and therefore we wo n’t be launching an investigation ’			1
a spokesman for @entity8 said : ‘ we would never want to suggest that @entity4 does n’t exist			2
we carried out a lot of research and found families have different @entity9 traditions			0
‘ ‘ some told us that @entity4 puts the presents in the stocking while family and friends place gifts under the tree			0
‘ others said that @entity4 brings most of the presents but mum and dad do buy some presents for the children as well as the gifts for the rest of the family			2
we like to think of @entity9 as a team effort			0
