suddenly , at the age of 34 and after 15 years of hoping for the exact opposite , i desperately wanted to get pregnant			1
my husband @entity4 was ready to be a father , we were financially secure and after editing a weekly magazine in @entity7 for four stressful years , i was ready to resign and focus on building a family			1
eleven months later , when my body was still not doing what i demanded , i got depressed , stressed and scared			2
proud mum @entity11 with her two children , @entity13 ( left ) and one - year - old @entity14 ( centre ) ' have i left it too late to have a baby ? ’ i ’d wail impatiently to @entity4 as month after month i ’d clutch at my abdomen in pain as my period started , filled with a burgeoning dread that my body was failing us			1
‘ i always put my career first , and travelling and having our dream wedding			2
now i ’m worried i ’m too old			2
’ i was paranoid that my life decisions had left my baby dreams impossible to reach			2
during my pre-broody years i ’d been bombarded with images of 40 - something celebrities , gloating about how easy it had been for them to conceive naturally and quickly			1
of course , horror stories in the tabloids tried to persuade me that i had about as much chance of procreating successfully after the age of 30 as i did of making it to @entity38 finals , but i had decided to follow the stars and wear blinkers			2
the truth , i was quickly discovering , lay somewhere in the middle of the heartbreak , guilt and misinformation women find themselves drowning in as they consider motherhood			1
happy family : after years of heartbreak , @entity11 and @entity4 have two children @entity13 , ( centre ) and @entity14 pregnancy expert @entity51 said : ‘ i think in a way modern life has done women a disservice			1
‘ we ’re told we can have it all , so women go on the pill while they are building their careers for many , many years , which masks any issues they may have such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis			1
' then when they decide to have a baby in their 30s , they are shocked if it does n’t happen as they planned			2
' we know that fertility starts to decline at 35 and that age is the biggest factor in a woman ’s ability to conceive			0
@entity11 and @entity4 celebrate their wedding with a dream day in the @entity75 in 2009 expectant parents @entity11 and husband @entity4 prepare for their son @entity13 's imminent arrival in 2011 ' what women need to do immediately is ask their mothers what age they went through the menopause : this is a key genetic factor in your own fertility , and your cycle starts to decline rapidly 10 years before you hit the menopause			1
’ eventually , @entity89 and i conceived - naturally - but at the 13 - week scan , the other horrific factor of late motherhood reared its ugly head			1
our baby had severe chromosomal abnormalities and had zero chance of survival			0
i was advised by a series of doctors to have a medical abortion , to safeguard my future fertility and mental state			0
‘ the sooner we get this unviable pregnancy dealt with , the quicker you can go on to conceive a healthy baby , ’ our specialist advised us			0
this sounds callous , but even through the fog of utter devastation i knew he was being cruel to be kind : i did n’t have too much time			0
i was turning 35 in one month			0
a few days later , as i was wheeled into the operating theatre , tears streamed down my cheeks and neck and onto my pale blue hospital robe			0
everyone was sad for me , but this was quite a common occurrence for a woman of my dotage			0
‘ well , you have left it quite late , have n’t you , ’ a few supposed sympathisers uttered in my direction when i was feeling sorry for myself			0
what had i expected ? preparing to be a new mum , @entity11 poses at nine months pregnant with her son @entity13 , born in 2011 friends were as divided as the media when it came to declaring their true fertility stories			1
while one friend admits to leaving it too late and worrying herself to sleep each night over the mounting @entity138 treatment bills ( her husband has insisted , scared of debt , she stop with the baby dream when they hit the £ 50,000 mark ) ; another friend is determined to put off pregnancy until she has passed some professional exams			0
‘ i ’ll only be 37 when i ’m done – and if i have to re-sit , i can delay pregnancy another year easily , ’ she tells me , perhaps naively			1
another friend got joyously pregnant with her first child on the eve of her 40th birthday			1
@entity11 celebrates the joy of having her son , @entity13 in 2011 , after the grief of having to end her first pregnancy her husband – who was depressed at being made redundant – threatened to kill himself if she kept the baby			1
so she had an abortion , while he suddenly seemed to get better – better enough to leave her for a 20 - something woman he met in his new job a few months later			1
‘ i ’ll regret that choice for the rest of my life , ’ she recently declared			0
‘ it was n’t until my womb was empty and he ’d gone that i realised i wanted a baby more than i wanted him			0
’ other friends in their mid-to - late 30s are choosing to stick their heads in the sand			1
‘ if i get to 40 and i ’m still single , i ’ll get just find a sperm donor , ’ is the flippant battle cry of many women i know			1
some friends get pregnant as soon as they decide to start trying , of course , and those ones frustrate me the most			1
there is nothing noble in my frustration ; i am despicably jealous – especially when these women do n’t appreciate how lucky they are			1
so what can women who know they want to have children in the future do to safeguard their future fertility ? ‘ the medical profession is considering lifestyle more , ’ says @entity187			2
‘ women and men need to look at their eating habits and whether they are under or overweight			2
' a @entity193 of between 19 and 26 is ideal for protecting fertility health			0
' avoid fizzy drinks and processed foods ; drink alcohol and caffeine in moderation and stop smoking and using drugs			0
' all these things cause free radical damage , which harms your long - term chances of conceiving			1
' there are no magic answers here ; future parents just need to follow a healthy lifestyle			0
’ @entity187 also thinks women should address any psychological issues they have before trying to become a parent			2
@entity11 's much longed - for son @entity13 , tenderly kisses his newborn baby sister @entity14 ‘ modern women are all about not getting pregnant , then suddenly a switch flips in their head at a certain age and they think they should be able to conceive immediately			1
yet blockages exist and they need to ask themselves questions to stop their sub-conscious sending negative messages			0
' how do you visualise your body ? how do you connect with your womb ? ' asks @entity187			0
' i believe acupuncture , hypnotherapy and counselling can help a woman prepare her body for the journey towards motherhood			0
’ now i am part of the envy - inducing club : i have two healthy children , a boy and a girl , although i did lose another pregnancy at 12 weeks in between their joyous arrivals			2
and that wonderful feeling is not something i ’d want any woman who desires it to miss out on because she has been lulled into a false sense of security or stress due to the misinformation surrounding the issue of fertility today			0
‘ one day ’ is a long way away			0
take control of your options today .			0
