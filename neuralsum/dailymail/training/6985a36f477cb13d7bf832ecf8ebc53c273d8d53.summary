it was the evening that will forever be remembered as ' @entity2			0
' the collapse from three goals in front with just 11 minutes left that saw @entity8 's title dreams die in a flood of tears			1
the sight of their distraught talisman @entity12 breaking down on the @entity15 pitch and being consoled by captain @entity16 went down in @entity18 folklore			2
it was so near and yet so far for @entity20 and his team			0
they had made it until the penultimate match of the campaign and still had hope , but that was obliterated by the boot of @entity29 and @entity30 lifted the trophy			2
@entity16 ( left ) and @entity32 look dejected after @entity33 take the lead during the second - half @entity36 and @entity37 react as @entity33 go 2 - 1 ahead through @entity38 with 13 minutes left @entity20 looks exasperated with his side as they struggled to cope with @entity33 's pace @entity42 ( second left ) celebrates after scoring @entity33 's third goal with a free - kick late on click here to read @entity47 's report from @entity15 six months on and @entity8 returned to the scene of their nightmare			1
the home fans were not in a sympathetic mood , chanting ' 3 - 0 and you f * * * ed it up ' in the direction of the away section during the first - half			1
as if the travelling hordes needed reminding - this venerable old ground will now forever send a shiver down the spine			0
the @entity8 team that walked out at @entity15 this time was similar in composition and yet much changed in confidence			1
@entity66 , @entity36 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity16 and @entity37 all remained , joined by a quartet of summer recruits and @entity71 , who came off the bench back in may			0
this season 's @entity8 have been a pale imitation of the swashbuckling side who challenged for honours last season with such elan and class			2
last season 's 3 - 3 draw , in which @entity8 surrendered a three - goal lead , became known as ' @entity2 ' - here , @entity16 consoles @entity12 at the final whistle back in may @entity33 's @entity87 tormented @entity8 's @entity88 all afternoon @entity87 ( right ) celebrates with @entity29 after the striker brought @entity33 level on 16 minutes a close - up of @entity20 ' face as @entity33 begin to dominate proceedings at @entity15 click here for more statistics from the match in our match zone their mid-table position is testament to that			1
no performance has matched those against , say , @entity103 ( 5 - 1 ) , @entity104 ( 3 - 0 ) and @entity30 ( 3 - 2 ) last season			2
they have been nowhere near as good			0
with @entity12 long gone and @entity108 and @entity109 sidelined , there had been worries about where @entity8 's cutting edge would come from here			2
however , a goal inside 90 seconds seemed to put those fears to rest			0
@entity116 pinged an exceptional 50 - yard diagonal ball over the top to his former @entity120 team - mate @entity119 and the striker , who had got beyond former @entity122 , finished coolly beneath @entity123			1
it was his first goal for the club and an encouraging sign for @entity20 of a striker trying to prove a point			0
unfortunately for the @entity8 manager , that would be their brightest moment all afternoon			2
@entity116 was @entity8 's most impressive player , with every pass he attempted in the first half finding its intended recipient			1
he maintained the high standards after the break too until he went off for @entity138 with 20 minutes left			0
@entity119 celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity8 just 90 seconds into the match @entity119 was found by an excellent cross-field ball from @entity116 @entity116 was @entity8 's best performer with his accurate passing but the same could not be said of his team - mates			1
@entity33 may be in the relegation zone but they dominated the majority of the match , the pace of their rampaging attacking players causing problems			2
@entity88 was tormented by @entity87 , who beat him on far too many occasions and was permitted to fire in four shots during the first - half			1
but his most telling contribution led to @entity33 's equaliser after 16 minutes			0
even more galling for @entity8 was that it was @entity29 , two - goal hero of ' @entity159 ' , who scored again			1
@entity8 's defence panicked when @entity161 attacked them with speed , cracking his shot against the base of the post			0
@entity36 was painfully slow to react and @entity29 followed it in to finish			0
the entire @entity8 back line made just one tackle between them in the opening 45 minutes , a damning statistic that shows how they struggled to contain @entity33 's pace			1
an unsuccessful challenge from @entity37 in the centre of the pitch led to @entity87 's run for @entity33 's equaliser @entity87 sets off on another forward run at @entity8 's vulnerable defensive line @entity87 was named @entity179 after his rampaging performance down the left wing the stats showed how @entity87 continually got the better of @entity88 they looked stretched all - too - often and that vulnerability cost them when @entity38 scored @entity33 's second with 12 minutes remaining			1
@entity8 had actually been enjoying their best spell of the game but when @entity87 left @entity32 for dead wide right to centre , leaving the unmarked @entity38 with a simple finish			1
@entity42 's magnificent free - kick shortly afterwards set the seal on a deserved @entity33 win that underlined just how far @entity8 have regressed			1
they dominated possession but looked ineffective with it in advanced areas			0
the jaw - dropping pace with which they attacked defences last season is absent - @entity37 was anonymous all afternoon			0
@entity68 and @entity16 registered a high percentage of accurate passes but few could be described as threatening to the @entity33 back - line			2
@entity87 got the better of @entity32 in the run - up to @entity38 's goal - @entity33 's second @entity37 walks off following a disappointing performance at @entity33 @entity37 's heat map shows his lack of influence during @entity8 's defeat @entity20 cuts a dejected - and very soggy - figure at the end of the match but it is that defensive line that is of greatest concern			1
the summer signings @entity32 and @entity88 do n't look comfortable and they were dragged out of shape with regularity and ease by a team second - bottom in the table			0
this was @entity8 's fourth consecutive defeat in all competitions and their slide continues			1
just two points now split these two teams			0
the famously vocal @entity33 support serenaded them with ' can we play you every week ' towards the close			0
anyone would fancy their chances against this @entity8 side at the moment .			0

@entity8 suffered a fourth straight defeat at @entity33 on *sunday*
@entity119 gave them an early lead but @entity29 levelled
second - half strikes from @entity38 and @entity42 earned *victory*
@entity8 had *bad* memories of @entity15 from title collapse
and poor performance here showed how they have gone backwards
