@entity1 's ambassador to @entity2 was summoned to the @entity3 last night after two @entity5 bombers flew over the @entity6			1
in scenes reminiscent of the @entity9 , the diplomat was asked to account for the incursion of the military aircraft , which caused civil flights to be diverted or delayed on wednesday			1
the long - range @entity14 ' bombers flew within 25 miles of the coast – through an area busy with passenger aircraft – forcing the @entity19 to scramble @entity21 jets			1
( @entity27 picture ) the fly - by is the most daring yet by the @entity5 military and comes amid worsening relations between @entity32 and the @entity33 – highlighted this week by the opening of the inquiry into the murder of former @entity38 spy @entity37			1
the @entity3 said wednesday 's incident was part of an ' increasing pattern of out - of - area operations by @entity5 aircraft '			1
a spokesman added : ' while the @entity5 planes did not enter sovereign @entity2 airspace and were escorted by @entity48 throughout the time they were in the @entity2 area of interest , the @entity5 planes caused disruption to civil aviation			2
' that is why we summoned the @entity5 ambassador today to account for the incident			2
' experts said @entity61 's move to send planes capable of carrying nuclear missiles so close to @entity2 shores could be seen as an act of aggression			0
they said the manoeuvre in the @entity6 could have been designed to probe the @entity19 's speed of reaction			0
closely watched : @entity19 @entity21 jets were scrambled in october to track this @entity5 @entity72 bomber , one of two which flew close to @entity2 without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers but defence secretary @entity76 last month warned that @entity5 's aggressive incursions could accidentally down a passenger jet and accused president @entity61 of playing a ' provocative and dangerous ' game			2
@entity19 jets were scrambled more than 100 times last year to escort @entity5 bombers away from @entity2 airspace			1
in wednesday 's incursion , the @entity83 travelled right round the @entity85 and were detected by long - range radars before being escorted away by @entity19 fighter jets based in @entity88 and @entity89			0
although the aircraft were travelling in international airspace , they were deviating from a standard route , triggering a ' quick reaction alert '			0
an @entity19 spokesman said : ' the operations room was both calm and focused			0
we constantly train for these scenarios so that we are well - rehearsed and ready to maintain the integrity of our airspace			0
' @entity5 defence officials defended the incursion as part of a 19 - hour ' air patrolling mission task ' through the @entity105 and @entity107 seas and @entity108			2
a spokesman revealed that @entity107 and @entity111 aircraft also followed the bombers , which carried out two aerial refuelling manoeuvres .			0
