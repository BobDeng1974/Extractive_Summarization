@entity16 is ' flattered ' that he 's now in the same league as @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity15			1
@entity19 has insured the tea blender 's tongue for £ 1m ' it 's very flattering of course ' , mr @entity16 said to @entity27 of his new status			1

' i usually drink my tea piping hot , so may have to be extra careful now and leave it to cool a while			1
' there are 1,500 different varieties of tea in the world and the palate of mr @entity16 is so refined , he can taste and grade any single one in just 15 seconds			1
his taste buds have distinguished more than 250,000 blends of tea during his nine - year career at @entity19			1
years spent touring tea gardens from @entity49 to @entity50 has seen the master tea blender develop , hone and refine his sense of taste			2
it takes five or more years of tasting hundreds of teas a week to build a good vocabulary of the countless different flavours , ' mr @entity16 explained			1
expensive assets : @entity11 's legs are covered for £ 1.2m ' some teas have very unlikely tastes			2
a well - made @entity64 tea will often have a raspberry jam flavor and you even get a strong taste calpol on some @entity69 teas			1
' blending tea , like blending whisky or champagne , is a fine art. first i examine and grade the colour , size and density of the leaf			1
' then i assess the brew 's purity of colour ( its sparkle ) , the weight of the tea in the mouth ( its body ) and the overall liveliness of the tea on the palate ( its zing )			1
' as it 's his job to drink tea , does he hate the taste by the time he 's finished ? or does he still like drinking tea ? ' i still drink loads of tea even at the end of a long day , ' he continued			2
' tasting tea is different from drinking it , as i have to slurp it off a soup spoon and then spit it out			2
1 ) the tea should be made with boiling water ­ and only once - boiled water with a low mineral content if possible			1
this is because reboiling reduces oxygen levels and affects the taste , whilst water with a low mineral content allows the tea notes to come through better			2
2 ) if you 're making black tea , stand by the kettle to ensure you pour as soon as it 's boiled			2
black tea tastes best when brewed in water as close to boiling point as possible			2
that 's why your cuppa may taste different on a plane			0
in the reduced pressure environment , the boiling point is lowered to 90 °			0
3 ) but if you 're making green tea , allow the kettle to cool for up to two minutes			2
this will make sure that your tea does n't over-infuse and develop a bitter taste			2
@entity131 teas are more delicate after all			0
4 ) when using a tea bag in a cup , always add your milk after the water , otherwise the milk will cool the water down and hinder the all important infusion process			2
if using a teapot , try adding the milk to the cup first			0
this traditional technique stopped the delicate porcelain cups from cracking			0
5 ) leave the bag in for at least two minutes to provide sufficient time to let the flavour of the tea to infuse			0
this is more of a guideline though ; the perfect brew is down to personal preference			0
but do not poke or prod the bag while it is infusing ­ be patient and let the process happen naturally ! 6 ) after removing the bag , leave the brew to cool down for around two - three minutes			0
as the temperature reduces , the flavours will develop for a better quality taste mr @entity16 has distinguished more than 250,000 blends of tea during his nine - year career at @entity19 @entity9 's breasts are covered for £ 1.2m and @entity15 ' killer smile is worth £ 18.6m 165,000,000 cups of tea is drunk in the @entity21 every day			1
