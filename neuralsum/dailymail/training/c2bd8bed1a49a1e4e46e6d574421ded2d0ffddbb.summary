special offers on crisps , sweets and fizzy drinks should be banned to encourage poorer families to eat more healthily , dr @entity8 said a study in 2012 by the @entity28 ’s @entity27 found that discounts and buy one , get one free deals were skewed towards unhealthy products research suggests there is a link between levels of income and the likelihood of obesity , particularly amongst women			1

' it is not just about the fact you are more likely to die earlier			0
you are more likely to spend more years with a disability			0
the cost of all of this is spiralling out of control			0
' the government 's responsibility deals – encouraging firms to sign voluntary agreements to improve public health – have not worked , dr @entity8 said			1
' one of the reasons why the most disadvantaged people are running into difficulties is partly because the healthy food is more expensive			2
' if you are struggling on a budget , you are much more likely to pick food on special offers			1
but all of the special offers tend to be on crisps , sweets and junk food			1
@entity78 mp dr @entity8 , a former gp , has vowed to to challenge ' all the crap from the lobbying industry , big alcohol and junk food industry ' ' just by saying to the big vested interest supermarkets , if you are going to have loss leaders , put them on foods that are healthy			1
' people can buy two packs , but do n't let 's see any more loss leaders on unhealthy food			1

she argued that if someone wants to lead an unhealthy lifestyle ' of course that 's entirely up to them '			2
but the government should intervene , with new regulations if necessary , to make it harder for people to buy junk food			1
she also wants an end to ' supersize ' deals in fast food restaurants and cinemas , where for a few pence more people are offered bigger drinks , snacks or meals			1
' while some people say it is draconian to say you can not sell mega-bucket sized portions of sugary drinks , why is it such a trauma to say it should be a standard size ? most of us tend to take the default size			2
' if you want to buy two , buy two			0
it is a simple way to say can you cut the calories			0
to some extent we have to accept that we may not change it for everyone			0
' but if there are simple things which take calories out , we should just get on with it			0
' one in 10 children aged 2 - 10 is obese , rising to almost a third among the over- 65s , official figures show she also wants calories stripped out of canteens in schools and hospitals and a ban on advertising of junk food to children			1

' no - one should pretend there 's a single thing we can do to wave a magic wand and everyone is suddenly slim and fit , ' dr @entity8 added			1
' there is a huge amount of personal responsibility			0
but it is now so serious we need to state to step in and take some measures			0
' the choice is you either do nothing and carry on saying it 's all down to personal choice and you continue to pick up a huge bill through the @entity104			0
