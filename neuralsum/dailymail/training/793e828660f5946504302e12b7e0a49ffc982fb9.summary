appearing in federal court in a prison jumpsuit yesterday , @entity3 said he was ' paying for a fatal lack of judgment			1
' ' i accept full responsibility , ' @entity3 told @entity20 district judge @entity19			1
prosecutors and @entity3 's lawyers agreed to the 13 - year sentence , with credit for the two years that @entity3 has spent behind bars since his arrest			1
@entity3 had high - level security clearances during decades of government work on science and space projects at @entity2 , the @entity31 and the @entity32 in president @entity34 's administration			1
@entity3 pleaded guilty to one count of attempted espionage , admitting he tried to provide @entity5 with top secret information about satellites , early warning systems , methods for retaliating against large - scale attack , communications intelligence information and major elements of defense strategy			1
in court , prosecutors played a videotape of @entity3 telling an @entity12 undercover agent posing as an @entity5 spy that ' i 've sort of crossed the @entity51 , ' or passed a point of no return			1
on the video , @entity3 said he would charge @entity5 ' at most one per cent ' for passing information about an unspecified program that @entity3 said cost the @entity20 government $ 200 million			1
@entity3 , 54 , was a ' traitor ' who engaged in attempted espionage with ' unbridled enthusiasm , ' assistant u.s. attorney @entity58 told the judge			2

one of @entity3 's lawyers , @entity96 , called the espionage case ' vindictive ' and an illustration of ' overreaching government conduct ' at a time when @entity3 was already enmeshed in the tax and fraud case			0
the government suspected @entity3 might be interested in spying after a investigators searched his @entity105 , at his home in @entity107 in february 2007 as part of the tax and fraud probe			0
expert : @entity3 came up with the concept behind the @entity89 space mission which went on to discover ice on the moon @entity3 ran a non-profit corporation called the @entity115 that had several agreements to develop advanced technology for the @entity20 government , but he was overstating his costs for reimbursement and failing to report the income on his tax returns			2
