@entity1 lawmakers think they have an answer to the problem of toy guns looking real – make them only in bright colors			2
the proposal is called the ‘ @entity9 ’ and is currently making the rounds in the state senate			2
it is a direct response to a spate of recent incidents involving police shooting children with toys that look like assault rifles			2
the most recent incident involved @entity18 , 13 , was shot dead oct 22 by @entity19 while carrying a toy gun officers determined was a threat			1
this ca n't keep happening : @entity1 state senator @entity23 ( @entity24 - @entity25 ) speaks during a friday news conference announcing the bill ‘ if officers would have seen a gun painted in pink , purple or orange , @entity18 might still be alive , ’ state senator @entity23 said in a statement announcing the bill			1

’ tragic death : @entity18 , 13			1
was shot dead by police in @entity25 , @entity1 , mistaking his bb gun for an @entity41 the teen ’s bb gun would have fallen under the guidelines established by the new bill , should it be signed into law , and would have been a neon color instead of the dark brown that threw officers off			1
‘ unfortunately , because of the strong resemblance to firearms , when officers must make split - second decisions on whether or not to use deadly force to protect the public , ’ the statement continued			0
‘ these replica guns can trigger tragic consequences			0
’ critics of similar regulations passed in other big cities have said bad guys will just paint their guns bright colors , @entity60 @entity59 pointed out			0

the bill is being sponsored by state senator who represents the *district* where a 13 - year - old @entity18 lived
*mr* @entity18 was shot dead by @entity25 police oct 22 for carrying a bb gun cops mistook for an @entity41
had the law been in place , the bb gun would have been a bright color and not caused *confusion*
