the report 's authors found the elderly - as well as patients with cancer and heart problems who are more at risk of complications - have been ' seriously underprioritised ' and ' forgotten ' by the @entity8 tens of thousands of patients are dying needlessly after routine operations because they are not being properly looked after in hospitals , leading surgeons warn			1
they are left ' languishing ' on wards run by junior doctors rather than being moved to specialised units tended to by teams of consultants and nurses			2
the @entity20 warns that care is so poor that these patients are four times more likely to die in @entity25 hospitals compared to the @entity26 they say the elderly – as well as patients with cancer and heart problems who are more at risk of complications – have been ' seriously underprioritised ' and ' forgotten ' by the @entity8			1
the report looked at more than 50 existing studies into care of these high - risk patients in @entity8 hospitals who had undergone common operations on their abdomen such as cancer and hernia operations , and removal of blockages in the bowel			1
it did not including heart surgery			1
of the 170,000 elderly and other high - risk patients who have these procedures every year more than half - 100,000 – will suffer some complication			1
and 25,000 – one in seven – will die			1
many develop infections – including life - threatening blood poisoning sepsis - which is not spotted by inexperienced junior doctors			2
the surgeons warn that the death - rate is far higher than other countries in the western world – and four times more than in the @entity26			1
they also say the failings are partly due to an obsession with meeting targets			2
' seriously underprioritised ' : the report looked at the care of high - risk patients who had undergone common operations managers and doctors are more concerned with getting patients booked into surgery within the required 18 weeks waiting - time , rather than ensuring the most vulnerable receive the highest standard of care			1
@entity71 , president of the @entity20 said : ‘ the focus on reducing waiting times for elective procedures has resulted in a large group , of mostly elderly patients , becoming seriously under prioritised to the point of neglect in the some @entity8 hospitals			1
all patients should have a clear diagnostic and monitoring plan when admitted to hospital			1
seniority of staff involved and urgency of treatment must reflect estimated risk to patient			2
each patient should have expected risk of death documented prior to surgery or other intervention			1
surgical procedures with a death risk greater than 10 % should be supervised by a consultant surgeon and consultant anaesthetist			2
patients with estimated risk higher than 10 % following surgery must be admitted to critical care			1
complications must be managed with an ' escalation strategy ' with defined time - points and involvement of senior staff			2
resulting care plans must be routinely recorded and reviewed			0
' these changes wo n’t happen on their own and we are calling on all surgeons and managers to work together to deliver the high quality care that these patients need and which some hospitals are already proving can be delivered			1
' mr @entity113 , report author and consultant general surgeon at @entity114 , said : ' every single emergency patient who comes through the door of an @entity8 hospital should have an individual risk assessment , diagnosis , treatment plan and post-operative care plan prioritised according to need			0
' instead we have some of the @entity8 ’ sickest patients languishing on inappropriate wards , treated by juniors and with no plan in place to deal promptly with unexpected complications			1
' these tend to be the patients who end up in intensive care units for lengthy periods of time or , sadly too sick to be helped			2
' the @entity132 has long highlighted the poor care of those in old age as part of our dignity for the @entity138 campaign			0
@entity139 , charity director of @entity140 , said : ' this is just more evidence that the @entity8 is not responding to the needs of older people who constitute the bulk of its patients			2
' it ’s shocking that some of the @entity140 ’s sickest and most vulnerable men and women are not receiving the emergency surgical and post operative care they need – care which can mean the difference between life and death			0
' improved care and treatment and routine risk assessments should be the right of every vulnerable patient not just those lucky enough to be in the right hospital			0
' grandmother @entity163 ( pictured , right ) went into hospital in to have a thigh fracture fixed			0
but the 84 - year - old died seven weeks later after losing two stones in weight			0
her daughters @entity169 and @entity171 were appalled by her care as they watched their mother waste away at @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176			0
@entity177 , 58 , who is a nurse and has two children , said : ‘ she was neglected in every way			0
‘ she was difficult to look after because she had severe vascular dementia but that ’s no excuse , she was n’t fed or washed , it was horrendous			0
we felt increasing despair as she was slipping away			0
' we wanted to share some quality time with her but it was spent on nagging and complaining as we tried to get the staff to look after her			0
’ mrs @entity163 weighed just 4st 6lb when she died in april 2009			0
the family has received a ‘ partial ’ apology for her care			0
‘ i hope she did n’t know what was happening to her , ’ said mrs @entity177			0
‘ we do n’t want anyone else ’s mother to go through the same ordeal			0
’ a spokesperson from the @entity197 said : ' we have made clear that safety must be at the heart of the @entity8			0
it is essential that hospitals provide the safest possible care for patients			1
' hospitals should follow this guidance and monitor the quality of care they are giving to their patients and ensure that they are providing appropriate levels of services and staffing			1
' we want our @entity8 to be truly - world class and that ’s why we are modernising the health service to improve results for patients and safeguard the @entity8 for future generations			2

patients who have abdominal surgery are four times more likely to die in @entity25 hospitals compared to @entity26
