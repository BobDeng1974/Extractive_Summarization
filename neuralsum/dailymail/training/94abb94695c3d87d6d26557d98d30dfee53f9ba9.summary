the nation 's largest private prison company is being held in contempt of court by a federal judge for chronic understaffing at an @entity6 prison			1
@entity8 district judge @entity7 made the ruling against the @entity11 , @entity12 - based @entity10 in a scathing 24 - page ruling issued on monday			1
in it , @entity7 took the company to task for lying about staffing levels and warned that he would make the fines as big as needed to force @entity10 's compliance with a settlement agreement it reached two years ago with @entity6 inmates and the @entity22			1
' if a prospective fine leads to $ 2.4 million in penalties , @entity10 has no one to blame but itself , ' @entity7 wrote			1
prison south of @entity27 so understaffed and violent that prisoners called it ' @entity29 ' the contempt finding stems from a case that began in 2010 when the @entity22 sued on behalf of inmates at the ise , contending that the facility was so violent that prisoners called it ' @entity29 ' and that understaffing and mismanagement contributed to the problem			0
@entity10 denied the allegations , but reached a settlement agreement with the inmates , promising to increase staffing levels above what was then required under its $ 29 million contract with the @entity46			2
that settlement agreement was slated to expire this month , but the @entity22 asked the judge to extend it and find @entity10 in contempt for failing to abide by the agreement			1
@entity10 acknowledged earlier this year that its employees filed reports with the state that falsely showed 4,800 hours of vacant security posts as being staffed during 2012			2
but during the contempt of court hearing earlier this month , witnesses revealed that number only included the night shift during a seven - month span			1
judge @entity7 makes ruling against @entity10 ' it is clear that the non-compliance was far worse than the report of about 4,800 hours would lead one to believe , ' @entity7 wrote			1
' there is also no reason to believe the problem only began in april 2012 and was solved after october 2012 , ' @entity7 added			0
' indeed , even in the weeks prior to the contempt hearings , mandatory posts were still going unfilled — thus there remains persistent staffing pressure that is the backdrop to prison employees fabricating records			2
' the difference today is that @entity10 may finally be presenting an accurate picture of its inability to fully staff its prison			2
' from now on , any mandatory post left unstaffed for more than 12 hours in a month will bring fines of $ 100 an hour , @entity7 wrote			1
he warned that he would raise the fine to $ 500 an hour — or higher — if things do n't change			0
the judge also rejected @entity10 's contention that the former warden and other company officials did n't know about the understaffing , saying that they had been warned of the staffing problems multiple times and at the very least failed to check it out			1
' for @entity10 staff to lie on so basic a point — whether an officer is actually at a post — leaves the @entity91 with serious concerns about compliance in other respects , such as whether every violent incident is reported , ' @entity7 wrote			1
from now on , the court will get staffing reports from an independent monitor who will watch staffing levels at the prison and report directly to the federal courts , @entity7 said			1
he said he would n't make @entity10 do an audit to determine just how many hours have been understaffed in the last few years because the @entity46 already has such an audit underway			2
the @entity106 are currently investigating whether @entity10 committed any crimes when it gave the false staffing reports to the @entity46 and when it failed to meet the minimum staffing requirements under its state contract			0
' further , @entity111 has contractual remedies against @entity10 ; it is up to that agency to determine what compensation it pursues for having been lied to , ' @entity7 wrote			1
he also rejected @entity10 's ' no harm , no foul ' claim that the understaffing did n't lead to increased violence or other problems			2
' having enough correctional officers can deter violence , but also it offers other benefits , such as having enough staff on the prison floor to accurately track the levels of violence in the first place , ' he noted			0
@entity10 spokesman @entity126 said in a prepared statement that the company was reviewing the ruling and considering next steps			0
' we believe we are taking all appropriate steps to correct the staffing matter and are unaware of any new findings beyond what we 've previously acknowledged			0
we are meeting the contractual staffing requirements and are working on an ongoing basis to ensure that continues , ' @entity126 wrote			0
' our top priority is the safety of our staff , the inmates entrusted to our care and the communities where we operate , and we are committed to providing the state and @entity6 's taxpayers with the highest quality corrections service			0
' @entity22 attorney @entity148 said in a prepared statement that the organization was thankful to the judge for carefully examining the evidence			0
' it took great effort to uncover the truth , ' @entity148 wrote			0
' @entity156 was missing thousands of hours of guards			0
what is particularly disturbing is that @entity10 failed to adequately staff @entity156 despite the obvious additional risk of assault that created for both prisoners and staff and the unnecessary stress and fear it generated			0

' from now on , any mandatory post left unstaffed for more than 12 hours in a month will bring fines of $ 100 an hour , ' said @entity8 district judge @entity7
