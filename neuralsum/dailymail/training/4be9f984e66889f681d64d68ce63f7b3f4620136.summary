by @entity1 reporter published : 13:53 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 13:55 est , 27 august 2013 @entity2 is promoting safe sex after saying she regrets having unprotected intercourse in her porn debut with an actor who days earlier slept with a star diagnosed as hiv positive			1
in a statement today , @entity10 said : ' some might call me a hypocrite for suddenly having this message about safe sex because i chose not to use a condom while filming my movie , @entity17 and me			1
' i do n't think i 'm a hypocrite though			1
i think it would be foolish of me to not learn from a teachable moment like this			1
had i not said anything about this , it would have felt like a missed opportunity on my part			1
and we all know i do n't like to miss opportunities			1
' @entity10 recently made the film @entity17 and me after a sexting relationship with the @entity31 mayoral candidate @entity17			1
the chain of events sparked fears that @entity10 may have been exposed to the virus			1
@entity10 said : ' i feel like it 's my duty to stress the importance of using condoms			1
' she went on to advise that condom use is important not just while making porn but if people were thinking about ' having a one night stand in real life '			1
she added : ' whether your partner is a porn star or not , you could be putting yourself at risk			1
you do n't know who all they have been with			1
' @entity17 's sexting partner said that she was not contacted about the possibility she may have been infected with @entity37 but that it was a ' very scary and surreal situation to be in '			1
she said : ' what 's so crazy about this is that the only time i 've been sexually active in many months was during filming , so just think , one sexual experience could put you in a scary situation			1
it 's just worth it to protect yourself and your partner			1
' x-rated : @entity35 and @entity10 ( pictured above ) starred in the porn film together , and @entity10 said she did have ' some boundaries ' when shooting the movie the newly - minted porn star said that in hindsight she should have used a condom on the set of her film but that she felt safe because the ' porn industry is very good about testing '			1
@entity10 said : ' i bet when you meet a new guy for the first time he does n't show you his clean @entity91 test results			1
that 's what 's different about the porn world			1
' however , she is now on a ' mission ' to have the porn industry ' get on board ' with using condoms			1
@entity10 added : ' ... i just hope recent events can help change some minds regarding this issue			1
if i can save even one girl from going through what i 've been dealing with , then i 'd say my mission is n't in vain			1
' so in conclusion , just wrap it up			1
it 's the smart thing to do			1
' distraught : @entity40 's agent says his client , whose recent hiv diagnosis has brought the porn industry to a standstill , is ' distraught ' over the news @entity10 also praised @entity40 for her bravery at coming forward to reveal her diagnosis			1
@entity120 's agent says his client is ' distraught ' after her recent hiv diagnosis but that the 29 - year - old actress is cooperating with the industry trade organization in an effort to ensure all her partners duly are informed of her status			1
‘ as difficult as this news is for me , ’ @entity120 said in a statement , ‘ i am hopeful that no other performers have been affected			1
i plan on doing everything possible to assist the medical professionals and my fellow performers			1
’ ' @entity133 has been a model citizen acting responsibly at this most difficult time , ' said her agent @entity135			2
' her courage should be lauded			2
' but @entity120 admits she now has a long road ahead			2
' my long - term plan is to take care of myself and my health , ' she said			2
a recently retired porn performer described some of the struggles @entity120 will likely face			2
' there 's no health insurance , there 's no union ; there really is n't a safety net , ' @entity145 told the @entity152			2
' i feel really bad for her			2
it 's got to be really tough to get that kind of news			2
' arrest : @entity40 seen in here in mugshots from some of her multiple arrests while in @entity161 @entity162 : her arrests range from traffic violations to forgery and even assault @entity167 exclusively revealed @entity120 's criminal past this week			2
the performer 's rap sheet shows more than 17 charges to her name , some of which were dismissed			2
she also spent more than a year in prison in @entity161 in 2007			2
her charges range from traffic violations to forgery and aggravated assault			2
@entity40 is not the porn star 's real name			2
@entity167 knows her true identity , but has chosen not to print it			2
@entity133 has worked under names including @entity184 and @entity185 , but before she embarked on a career in porn she appeared on @entity190 's @entity189 in 2009			2
the show centers around couples who are sent to relationship boot camp in order to save their unions			2
the season ran for eight episodes , and @entity133 along with her boyfriend of 10 years , @entity198 - who had nicknamed himself ' celebrity ' - were eliminated in the third episode			0
just two years before her reality tv debut , @entity133 spent a year and six months in prison for an unknown offense in @entity161			0
she was released in may 2008			0
her latest arrest came in february , where she was arrested for criminal damage and disorderly conduct			0
she was also arrested in october last year for criminal damage , disorderly conduct and interfering with judicial proceedings			0

risk : @entity35 , left , who played @entity17 in the movie with @entity2 , had unprotected sex with @entity40 , right , a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has @entity37 @entity40 spoke to @entity221 to confirm she was the performer responsible for the moratorium on porn production			1
cutting edge testing lab told @entity120 on wednesday that a blood sample drawn the previous day came back positive for @entity37			0
she told @entity221 that she was ' obviously extremely distraught and in disbelief ' , and that an additional test will be conducted to confirm the result			0
according to @entity120 , she received her last clean bill of health on july 27			0
just days later she filmed an unprotected sex scene for a series called @entity234			1
her male partner was @entity35			0
@entity236 reports he and @entity10 also had unprotected sex for the @entity239 movie			1
in a statement to the site , @entity10 said both she and @entity35 got tested prior to shooting their scene , and both were deemed ' healthy '			0
however , the presence of @entity91 sometimes does not come up in tests for up to three months after exposure			0
it takes the body two - to - eight weeks to make antibodies against @entity37 - known as the window period			0
tests done immediately after the exposure or within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false negative result			0
the @entity256 recommends that individuals who have been exposed to @entity37 and have been found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three months			0
@entity10 said in an earlier statement : ' i do not have @entity37 and have not been exposed to @entity37 regardless of the reports out there saying otherwise			0
' i was not contacted by the @entity262 to re-test , i reached out to them to see if i should re-test and was told i did not need to			0
' i took all the necessary precautions before and after my scene for @entity267 and acted responsibly and therefore was able to protect myself from exposure to anything			0
' as an added precaution i retested 2 days after my shoot and again yesterday and was negative			0
' @entity272 , executive director of the industry trade group the @entity262 , told the @entity274 in an e-mail about the @entity37 detection : ' the moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated			0
virus : @entity40 , who has appeared in adult films since 2010 , confirmed last night she was the performer responsible for the moratorium ' in fact , since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers testing positive for @entity37 and neither of those situations involved on - set transmission , ' @entity289 said			0
' the current situation would bring the number to three cases in nearly 10 years , not just in @entity295 but nationwide			0
' the industry briefly put a similar moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were infected during a syphilis outbreak			0
word of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn industry opponents			0
among them was @entity306 , whose group the @entity307 successfully lobbied voters last year to adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most porn films			0
' how many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases - including @entity37 , which is not curable - before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use , ' he said in a statement			0
since the ordinance 's adoption , county officials have said they are investigating one violation			0
assemblyman @entity325 , who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law , called wednesday 's news ' devastating and preventable			0
' ' exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation , ' the @entity295 @entity329 said			0
the industry , which says its audience does not want to see condoms , is fighting the @entity338 measure in court			0
unhappy : @entity40 faces up to her ex-boyfriend on the @entity190 show @entity189 before she was a porn star : @entity40 appeared on @entity190 's @entity189 in 2009 alongside her former boyfriend @entity343			0
