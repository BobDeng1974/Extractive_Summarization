co-pilot sergeant @entity2 defied death and a 100mph slipstream by crawling out along the wing with nothing but a length of rope tied around his waist for security			1
@entity21 was awarded the @entity22 for his bravery - and now , the @entity24 won by the pilot , squadron leader @entity25 , has sold for £ 7,500 at auction in @entity27			1
@entity28 did a remarkable job keeping the blazing plane steady while @entity21 draped a canvas cover over the inferno in the engine			1
after extinguishing the flames he was pulled back into the @entity37 bomber by the rest of the crew who had been preparing to bail out over the @entity40			1
@entity28 managed to fly the battered plane back to its base in @entity43 where it was only stopped from careering off the end of the runway by a barbed wire fence			2
the two pilots had been flying a @entity37 bomber and its crew of six on a raid over @entity51 , @entity52 , in july 1941 when they were shot at by a @entity54 nightfighter			1
although rear gunner @entity56 shot the @entity59 plane down , the bomber was critically damaged with its starboard engine out of action and ablaze			2
@entity28 instructed the crew to put their parachutes on in readiness to jump and then yelled out ‘ ... and see if you can put out that bloody fire ’			0
@entity21 ripped away the fuselage fabric and tried in vain to douse the flames with a fire extinguisher			2
prized : @entity28 's medals sold for £ 7,500 at the auction at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity27 saved : after extinguishing the flames co-pilot sergeant @entity2 was pulled back into the @entity37 bomber ( file picture ) by the rest of the crew who had been preparing to bail out over the @entity40 @entity81 , head of archives at the @entity83 , said : ‘ i do n’t think when @entity25 told someone to put the fire out he was seriously suggesting that someone went out on to the wing			1
‘ @entity2 picked up the cockpit canvas cover and casually told a member of the crew " i think i will hop out with this "			1
hero : squadron leader @entity25 did a remarkable job keeping the blazing plane steady ‘ his comrade tried to dissuade him and @entity2 agreed to have a rope tied around his waist with the other end tied around the chest of a crew man			1
‘ @entity25 held the aircraft steady to enable @entity2 to get onto the wing			1
the metal wing was covered in fabric and that allowed @entity2 to grab hold of something as he crawled out			2
‘ @entity2 held on with one hand as he managed to smother the fire with the cover			2
the slipstream began to tug the cover and it then whipped off			0
‘ but the flames gradually lessened and @entity2 was pulled back into the aircraft			1
they had just set out over the @entity40 at the time and so this would have all happened at a height of 10,000ft			0
‘ as captain , @entity28 ’s aim was to get the aircraft home but more importantly his crew as well , rather than they bale out and be captured or killed			0
‘ but to say @entity2 went the extra mile to ensure this would be something of an understatement			2
‘ when you think of @entity130 in @entity131 , you think of people like @entity133 and @entity134 but @entity2 is n’t one of those names that immediately springs to mind			2
’ @entity21 , a @entity137 , was invited to @entity138 to meet @entity139 after his heroic action			0
sadly , he was killed two months later when his aircraft was struck by flak over @entity143 , caught fire and crashed			0

this involved ' weaving ' the individual struts of the fuselage to provide a resilient airframe			0
the first squadron to receive the @entity37 was no 99 at @entity162 , @entity43 , in 1938			0
crews saw the aircraft as sturdy , reliable and able to take plenty of damage in combat			0
