they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and that was certainly true of lingerie tycoon @entity5 following the breakdown of her 22 - year marriage			1
the mother - of - three revealed in her autobiography how she was furious to discover her husband , @entity10 , was seeing her old friend and colleague @entity11 following their split			1
@entity5 , 43 , was suspicious that the pair had started their relationship before she and @entity10 separated - but this is an allegation he has always denied			1
and matters were not helped by the fact she continued to share her six - bedroom mansion in an affluent area of @entity28 with her ex for eight months after they agreed to separate			0
during this time , @entity5 waged war against the father of her children , damaging his prized @entity34 , cutting up his clothes and putting laxatives in his coffee			1
but now years later and in a much happier place , @entity5 admits she regrets her acts of childish revenge			1
' when i found out about my ex employee and ex husband it was my way of getting the hurt out for 18 months , ' she said on today 's @entity46			1
the lingerie tycoon told this morning presenters @entity48 and @entity50 that married couples who work together - like they do - should set ground rules to stop work going home with them @entity5 split with husband @entity10 , the father of her three children , in 2011 ' i was so bitter , it was so out of character , i am not like that			1
i really regret it but every day is a school day and every day we learn and get stronger			0
' i did do things i regret , like smashing up his car			0
' the @entity67 founder told presenters @entity48 and @entity50 on the @entity69 show that she wishes she had thought about the effect her behaviour was having on their children , who were then aged 12 , 15 and 19			0
she said : ' we lived together for eight months after the break up and i do feel bad for putting the kids through that			0
i was drinking heavily and just thinking about me			2
i was n't thinking about how my behaviour effected my kids			1
' @entity5 admitted she flew into a rage when she discovered her ex husband had started a new relationship with @entity11 , left , who had once been her friend and @entity67 head of design @entity5 admitted that she is now off the booze and has n't had a drink since december 31			1
after fighting for control of @entity67 from her former business partner husband ( who went on to set up a rival lingerie company with @entity11 ) , she has since sold 80 per cent of @entity67 and is no longer the chief executive			1
she said she prefers to do motivational speaking and advises couples to learn from her mistakes when it comes to working with a loved one			0
she said : ' if you are going to work with your partner , you have to have set of up ground rules , do n't talk about phoning the bank when you 're in bed together on a friday evening			2
' if you take business home with you , you will get a divorce or the business will go bust			2
' @entity5 , who grew up in poverty in the @entity109 of @entity110 , married @entity10 when she was 18 after she fell pregnant with their first child			1
the couple launched @entity67 together in 1999 after setting up their company @entity114 in 1996			0
but @entity5 admits the stress of making their business venture a success took its toll on their relationship			1
she wrote in her autobiography , my fight to @entity125 , published by @entity126 yesterday : ' going to work became like walking through a minefield , our boardroom meetings constantly interrupted by one or other of us storming out , and the arguments continued at home where our sex life was virtually non-existent			0
' after calling time on their relationship in 2011 , the couple said in a statement on their separation that ' no other parties had been involved and the split was amicable			2
' the mother - of - three , pictured modelling for @entity67 , is no longer as involved in the brand she founded however , things soon turned sour when @entity5 discovered her husband had moved on with @entity11 , who had been the head of design at @entity67 and had lived in a guest annex next to their mansion			1
@entity5 explains in her book how she discovered @entity10 and @entity11 were together after hiring a private detective who gave her pictures of them kissing			1
@entity5 said it was finding out about their relationship that tipped her over the edge			2
she writes : ' deep down i knew my marriage had been over for years , but i still felt indescribable pain			0
my knees buckled and i fell to the ground crying			0
' my grief turned to anger			0
after texting @entity10 to tell him that he had been caught red - handed , i grabbed a knife and went to town on his beloved @entity34 , scratching it to shreds			1
' then i charged round to the guesthouse where @entity171 was living - thanks to the kindness which she had betrayed - and threw all of her possessions into the garden , the dressing table along with them			0
i was like a banshee			0
' @entity5 , pictured this week , said she feels in good health having not drank alcohol since 31 december she added that she continued to terrorise her ex for the following months they continued to live together			2
' i put his favourite shirts and cufflinks in the bin			2
i let down his car tyres			0
i cut holes in all his boxer shorts			0
i put laxatives in his coffee on the day that he and @entity171 were going to a wedding - @entity193 only knows if that worked , ' she writes			1
' on the day i moved out to a hotel i crept up to the master bedroom , pulled back the luxurious throw and threw a bucket of cold water over his side of the bed before replacing the covers			0
' but now she realises that she made a mistake in treating him this way and wishes she had behaved differently			0
now she 's moved on to live in her own place , stepped back from @entity67 and taken on a role as a motivation speaker , she wants to help other people be strong through adversity			2
' if you do n't love yourself , that 's where the problems begin , ' she advised on this morning .			2
