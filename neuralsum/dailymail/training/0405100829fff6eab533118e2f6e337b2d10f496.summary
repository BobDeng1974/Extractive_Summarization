by @entity0 calls for ' busty lab workers ' , ' sexy nuns ' and actresses who are ' slim with teardrop breasts ' might sound distinctly 1970s in tone but , incredibly , they do n't come from vintage ads. instead they 're just some of the sexist requests that flood casting sites every day , according to the actress behind a blog named @entity13			1
speaking to the @entity14 , the blogger , who has chosen to remain anonymous and goes by the moniker ' miss l ' , revealed that the seedy side of acting is still with us and shows no sign of going away			1
' and miss @entity30 is n't the only actress to speak out about sexist behaviour in the world of tv , theatre and film			1
speaking at the @entity48 last year , @entity47 used a 30 - second appearance to lambast the industry and lament the lack of female directors			1
as she presented @entity54 with an award , the actress said : ' now i just want to say quickly , it was great to hear @entity54 's little list of moments that inspired him			2
outspoken : both @entity47 and @entity60 have spoken out about sexism in the acting world ' i did , however , note that there was not one woman 's name there behind the camera			1
i just hope , i pray , i know , that in five or ten years â€™ time , when the next @entity54 gets up and makes his or hopefully her speech , there will be two or three or four women 's names there			2
' she added : ' there are wonderful female directors coming up , many of them @entity75 , and it 's wonderful to see that			2
' equally unimpressed is @entity60 who used a @entity82 interview last year to complain about ' casting couch style interviews ' and told of an incident that took place when she was a teenager , in which a director asked her to sit with her legs open			1
she continued : ' we all need to recognise our part in trying to be aware of sexism and exploitation			1
it 's really bizarre that violence against women is n't a number one priority			0
' despite their pleas for change , as miss l 's blog reveals , it seems that the casting couch is one film fixture that is yet to be packed away			2
along with bizarre requests for sexy nuns and the ability to withstand buckets of fake blood , @entity13 also shines a light on some of the eye - wateringly sexist attributes included in casting ads. here are some of the worst : ' @entity115 : two very under - qualified lab workers in cute shoes			1
' ' male - fully clothed			0
female - dressed in thong , semi-naked at times , has to do casting in underwear			2
' ' must be able to portray a slag			0
' ' this production will require no nudity on camera however nudity will be required on set			0
' ' she gets a couple of lines , a light - hearted orgy scene and then gets kicked through the window			0
' ' well spoken bikini model needed to interview local politicians			0
' ' @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140			0
' ' girls must be up for semi-nudity , kissing and getting covered in muck and goo			0
' ' 2 actors & 2 actresses required			0
partial nudity required for the actresses			0
