' mum and dad would get very upset as i did n't recognise them and it was hard for them to deal with it			2
' we had tried everything			0
i would look at family photographs and i knew it was me in them but i just could n't remember anything about why i was there			2
' it totally ruined me			0
i could not go back to school and i lost my family and friends and did not know who i was			1
' my brother and sister , who were six and eight at the time , did n't really understand			2
' it sounds weird and is hard to explain but the first thing i remember was my little brother @entity18			1
' our bond is a really powerful thing and he just came in to my room and gave me a big hug			2
' we have always had a close bond and a special relationship and somehow that moment just triggered everything coming back to me			2
' after that hug all my family memories came back - every last one of them			1
' miss @entity6 claims she developed severe amnesia nearly two years ago after suffering serious side effects from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine - after suffering severe headaches miss @entity6 had always suffered bad headaches but it was not until just before her 15th birthday that medical staff diagnosed her with idiopathic intracranial hypertension			1

she said : ' it was like a switch was flicked and all my memories just disappeared			2
' i did n't recognise my mum or my family			1

' i thought she must be my mum but i did n't remember anything about her or anything that we had done together			0
' it is a known side effect to the treatment			0
i have since heard that some people forget how to do their jobs and forget their families			0
' @entity6 was sent home from hospital to try to re-jog her memories			1
but it was only the hug from her brother brought all her family memories back			1
she said : ' i was off school for two months			2
i did n't really understand what was going on - i just kept thinking " i do n't remember you "			0
' but with my best friend it clicked immediately just by the way we started talking to each other			0

my consultant tested me for quite a lot of things and ran out of what to give me to help			0
' @entity6 is now on a drug called acetazolamide to help reduce the fluid in her back - and has fortunately not suffered from any headaches now for a year			1
she explained : ' my condition has n't been properly diagnosed or treated yet because they do n't really know what causes it			0
' but they know that if it comes back to perform a lumbar puncture as a quick solution - but i 'm terrified i could lose all my memory again			1
' she added : ' my condition is so powerful that it can kill people , either by it not being treated and too much pressure on the brain or people get fed up of being told it 's just a headache that they lose faith and end up committing suicide			0
' no - one really understands how painful it is			0
