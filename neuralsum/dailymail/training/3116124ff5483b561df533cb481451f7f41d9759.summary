every feature , every wrinkle and every hair in this image has been painstakingly designed to create an ultra-realistic model			0
the 3d model is based on 77 - year - old actress @entity6 , and was made using high - resolution scans taken on a 94 - camera rig			1
shaders were added to the skin , subtle hairs were added to the body and even the tear ducts were built using layers of digital colour			2
designers used high - resolution scans of 77 - year - old actress and model @entity6 before using a computer to build layers of skin , eyes and even tear ducts it was created as part of a @entity33 study into mortality , using a technique known as photogrammetry , and features in the video for @entity39 ’s single @entity38			1
the video was directed by @entity41 , which was responsible for @entity45 ’s @entity44 promo @entity42 , and its laser ‘ @entity46 ’ featured in @entity50 ’s @entity49 exhibition			2
@entity39 worked with photogrammetry firm @entity51 to create a full body scan of model @entity6 using a 94 - camera system			1
the 360º scans were then sent to visual effects experts at @entity18			1
@entity18 shot a spherical panoramic high dynamic range photo of a sunset through a window in the studio ’s toilet			0
the two photographic processes were combined using 3d software so the sunset illuminated ms @entity6 ’s scanned body parts			2
@entity18 then built realistic shaders for the skin to add definition , wrinkles , highlights and shadows to the model ’s features			0
the project was the beginning of a study into filmmaking for the virtual reality environment			0
@entity39 worked with photogrammetry firm @entity51 to create a full body scan of ms @entity6 using a 94 - camera system			1
these cameras were able to scan every inch of the model in high - resolution			1
each scan was captured 360º and at 1/13,000th of a second			0
the scans were then sent to visual effects experts at @entity18 , who have worked with @entity41 on other similar project			1
@entity18 shot a spherical panoramic high dynamic range photo of a sunset through a window in the studio ’s toilet			0
the two photographic processes were combined using 3d software so the sunset illuminated ms @entity6 ’s scanned body parts			2

@entity39 worked with photogrammetry firm @entity51 to create a full body scan of ms @entity6 using a 94 - camera system ( pictured ) each scan was captured in 360º , at 1/13,000th of a second			1
as a result the cameras were able to scan every inch of the model ( pictured ) in high - resolution ‘ we wanted to go beyond the limits of the audience ’s eyeballs - using @entity33 to reveal different perspectives on the human form , ’ explained the band			1
‘ obviously the eyes are extremely important in making a 3d person look realistic , so @entity18 built their own layered eyes and tear ducts			2
‘ another thing they added was subtle hairs on the body			0
’ the scans were then sent to @entity18 's visual effects , who began building a 3d model of ms @entity6 ( pictured ) @entity18 shot a spherical panoramic high dynamic range photo of a sunset through a window in the studio ’s toilet			1
the two photographic processes were combined using 3d software so the sunset illuminated ms @entity6 ’s scanned body parts			2
this images shows the flattened version of the model 's virtual face @entity18 then built realistic shaders for the skin to add definition , wrinkles , highlights and shadows to the model ’s features ( pictured ) in the video , ms @entity6 is shown ‘ returning to dust ’ , so @entity18 additionally sculpted alternative versions of the model covered in ash - like material			1
in addition to the main model , @entity18 created the realistic cloth and flowers			0
‘ once we had decided on camera moves and light positions , every scene was lit and rendered at @entity18 , ’ @entity39 continued			0
‘ taking this level of detail to real - time virtual - reality environments is our next challenge			0
’ ‘ we wanted to go beyond the limits of the audience ’s eyeballs - using @entity33 to reveal different perspectives on the human form , ’ explained the band according to @entity39 : ' obviously the eyes are extremely important in making a 3d person look realistic , so @entity18 built their own layered eyes and tear ducts ' ( pictured ) in the video , ms @entity6 is shown ‘ returning to dust ’ , so @entity18 additionally sculpted alternative versions of the model covered in ash - like material			1
in addition to the main model , @entity18 created the realistic cloth ( pictured )			0

the model was created by @entity20 - based visual effects studio @entity18
designers worked with photographers from @entity51 and band @entity39
they used high - resolution scans taken using @entity51 ’s 94 - camera rig
it was created for a *music* video directed by @entity41
the *elderly* woman is actress and model @entity6
@entity18 used a computer to build layers of skin , eyes and even tear ducts
the result is a super-realistic model of 77 - year - old ms @entity6
