tourists visiting @entity1 and @entity2 could be at risk of contracting dengue fever in the future			1
@entity8 holiday destinations could become hotspots for the nasty viral illness thanks to climate change , experts have warned			2
if global warming continues on its current trajectory , the risk of dengue fever in @entity8 is likely to increase , they say			1
tourists visiting areas of southern @entity1 such as @entity18 ( pictured ) could be at risk of dengue fever in the future , due to climate change the @entity23 in @entity2 , the @entity1 @entity24 and southern @entity1 are the areas at most risk , according to research by the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1
@entity29 is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes			1
symptoms include a severe flu - like illness , fever , headache , muscle ache , rash , nausea and vomiting			0
it is often referred to as ' breakbone ' fever due to the excruciating pain it causes			0
mosquitoes that carry and transmit the virus thrive in warm and humid conditions – which could one day include large areas in southern @entity8			1
the new study was based on data collected in @entity51 , where dengue is a common problem			1
researchers looked at the occurrence of the viral illness and climate variables such as temperature , humidity and rainfall , along with other factors			0
they then combined their findings with information about @entity65 countries , to model which areas are most likely to be at risk , according to the study , published in the journal @entity70			0
@entity29 is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes			1
it thrives in warm and humid conditions - which could one day include include large areas in southern @entity8 ‘ our study has shown that the risk of dengue fever is likely to increase in @entity8 under climate change , but that almost all of the excess risk will fall on the coastal areas of the @entity24 and @entity83 seas and the @entity85 part of @entity2 , particularly the @entity23 , ’ said lead researcher professor @entity73			1
‘ the exact incidence of dengue fever is dependent on several other factors , some of which we were unable to model at this stage			2
‘ nevertheless , public health agencies in high risk areas need to plan , implement and evaluate active reporting of mosquito populations and clinical surveillance by local doctors			0
‘ @entity98 should be carried out to improve awareness of the increased risk amongst health practitioners and the general public			0

in july , health officials said that the number of travellers returning to @entity123 with dengue fever is rising			0
between 2012 and 2013 , officials noted a 58 per cent increase in the number of cases of dengue fever reported among holidaymakers			2
@entity123 ( @entity131 ) said that in 2013 , a total of 541 people returned to @entity134 with the infection from dengue - affected countries , compared to 343 people in 2012			0
most cases were reported in travellers to @entity140 and @entity141 , but @entity131 also noted an increase in cases associated with travel to @entity145 during 2013 .			0

risk of dengue fever in @entity8 is likely to increase , researchers claim
@entity29 is a viral infection carried and spread by mosquitoes

this is dependent on climate change continuing on its current trajectory
