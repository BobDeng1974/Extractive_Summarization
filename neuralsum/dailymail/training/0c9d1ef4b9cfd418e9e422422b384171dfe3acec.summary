but the lights are not being stolen to put in another car , instead it is believed that the @entity12 headlights are ideal for lighting solutions when growing marijuana			1
getting to work : a thief is caught on camera attempting to steal the headlights from @entity4 working hard : the thief tries to prize the headlight off the car the xenon bulbs , which are sold for between $ 100 to $ 500 and up , are understood to deliver just - right blend of light and heat for budding amateur horticulturists			0
and the high - intensity discharge bulbs give off more heat and require much less power than standard grow lamps , and most importantly they offer the right quality of light and heat			0
going for @entity33 : the thief targets the second light making a get away : the thief gets away from the scene of the crime with the lights - but leaves the car according to @entity43 newspaper @entity42 as many as 20 cars have been targeted leaving plenty of unhappy owners			2
adding insult to injury , prying the headlight from the cars with a screw driver often results in thousands of dollar ’s worth of additional damage on top of the cost of replacing the headlights .			0
