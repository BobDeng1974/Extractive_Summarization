click here to watch @entity3 's @entity2 goals ... it took just one moment of magic , one goal in his first training session as a @entity11 player , for @entity12 to appreciate that @entity3 could be an awful lot of money well spent			1
‘ when you can hire or buy a player like @entity3 then i do n’t have doubts because he is , for me , one of the best strikers in the world			1
when you see his record it is unbelievable , ’ said @entity15 at a press conference to unveil the 28 - year - old @entity18 striker			1
‘ at training he got one ball and it was in the goal			2
he confirmed it in his first training session with me			1
but when i say that , i put too much pressure on him and that ’s not good			0
it will cost them another £ 46m to exercise an option to buy him outright next summer			2
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity44 — whose appearance on thursday was rather overshadowed by the man sitting to his left — also came through the door as part of a £ 150m summer spending spree			1
this has inevitably led to questions about @entity11 ’s transfer policy under @entity15 and executive vice-chairman @entity82			1
that is unlikely to faze @entity3			1
after all , this is the fourth time he has moved clubs in the last five years			2
this time last year he was being paraded as @entity48 ’s record £ 48m signing			1
at least the former @entity92 and @entity93 player expressed a desire to hang around a little longer this time			1
‘ i hope to stay many years in @entity11 and make history at this club , ’ said @entity3 , whose record of 220 goals in 356 career games compares pretty well against @entity99 ’s strike rate of 29 goals in 142 games — brought up rather surprisingly by @entity15 yesterday			1
‘ when i was at @entity92 and @entity93 i always wanted to improve and i dreamed about playing in a team like this , ’ added @entity3			1
‘ it ’s a new process and a new team			0
some players have come and @entity11 are building a big team this season and future seasons			1
‘ i would like to be here and be part of the project			0
i am very happy to be here			0
it ’s a big challenge for me for my career			0
i always dreamed to be in a club like @entity11			1
’ @entity117 of a new era : new signings @entity71 ( r ) , @entity69 ( @entity120 ) and @entity70 ( @entity121 ) join their @entity11 teammates for training at the @entity124 @entity126 connection : @entity12 speaks to @entity3 after hinting he would like to sign the @entity48 striker on a permanent deal last in : versatile @entity129 @entity44 ( @entity43 ) and free scoring @entity126 @entity3 were both signed by the club on transfer deadline day fighting fit ? @entity3 insists he has recovered from the cruciate ligament injury that forced him to miss the @entity134 in @entity135 @entity3 has made six appearances and scored two goals for club and country since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing for @entity48 in a @entity143 tie in january , but has yet to complete a full game			1
his brief appearance for @entity18 as a substitute against @entity135 in @entity147 on friday took his total playing time to 217 minutes — an average of 38 minutes per game — but he insists he is fully recovered			1
‘ yes , i feel well , ’ he added			0
‘ i started to play two months ago with @entity48 and i have improved in the last month a lot			2
i scored goals , and that is important to strikers			0
‘ i ’m confident with my physical form and i ’m comfortable with my knee			0
i feel good in myself			0
’ questions have been raised about how @entity15 can fit all his new signings into the same team alongside the likes of @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , who has only been at @entity11 eight months since a £ 37.1m move from @entity165			1
there could be up to four of them making home debuts against @entity169 on sunday			2
multi-talented : @entity44 can play in a variety of positions across defence and midfield , although a central holding role is his preferred position @entity129 master : @entity12 ( c ) speaks to his players during training , including defender @entity72 ( r ) who could make his debut against @entity169 on the mend : manager @entity12 ( r ) will be pleased that @entity182 ( @entity43 ) has recovered from injury to take part in training @entity3 does not foresee any problems , however			1
‘ when you ’re talking about settling in , when you ’re talking about top - quality players , it makes settling in more easy , ’ he added			2
‘ i think i will need not much time because @entity11 has very good players and it ’s easier to play football			1
i ’m used to life in cities like this			0
i do n’t think i will have a problem adapting			0
‘ i see the club in a period of everyone needing to get to know one another			0
but they are top - quality players and very intelligent players who can apply what the coach has in mind for us on the field quickly			2
‘ in terms of where i play , that is something the manager will have to decide for me			0
‘ i ’ve been fortunate to play at some big clubs all over the world in big games and finals			0
i would rather focus on enjoying my football and making the most of the opportunity @entity11 have given me			2
i tend to set myself personal targets and goals and that ’s how players challenge themselves			0
’ @entity3 was reluctant to talk about the other clubs linked with him this summer , including @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225			2
all three teams are playing in the @entity227 in @entity11 ’s absence			1
for @entity3 , it will be a fifth season in a row outside the @entity232 elite , but he does not expect to be kept waiting much longer			1
‘ it ’s true , every player wants to play in the @entity227 , ’ he said			2
‘ this year it ’s not possible in @entity235 but we are confident that we will qualify next season			0
‘ i do n’t want to talk about other teams			0
i can say that i ’m very happy here and believe in this project			0
@entity11 are the best club for my style of play and i am sure it will be a great period for us in the future			2
’ next generation : united youngsters @entity248 ( @entity43 ) and @entity72 ( r ) get to know each other ahead of @entity11 's next game against @entity169 made in @entity251 : @entity252 @entity69 and @entity71 ( r ) are joined by @entity18 international @entity3 ( @entity43 ) old school : @entity11 and @entity254 captain @entity161 spaeks to @entity255 ( @entity43 ) after returning from a successful international break @entity11 ’s new signing spoke mainly in broken @entity258 but answered a couple of questions from the @entity251 media more fluently in @entity262			1
as he got up to leave at the end , @entity15 grabbed him by the right arm and addressed his audience			0
‘ what do you think about his @entity258 ? ’ asked the former @entity268 coach			0
‘ because i had the same situation in @entity262			0
in my first year i spoke @entity258 , in my second year @entity262			0
and he is coming here and he is speaking @entity258 for you			0
yeah , ok ? ’ it brought a round of applause but , for this kind of money , @entity11 supporters will expect @entity3 to do his talking on the pitch			1
