@entity0 , which has been dubbed a next generation messaging service , is just two years old and was started by 23 - year - old @entity10 and friends			1
the co-founder of the company has reportedly turned down the huge all - cash offer , which would have valued snapchat $ 4 billion – but the firm is said to be being wooed by other investors and possible buyers			2
sources close to the company told @entity19 that mr @entity10 , who dropped out of @entity20 , is hoping for a better offer			2
while @entity24 - based @entity0 has no sales or business model , its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds , making it a truly instant service , instead of a more permanent record collector like @entity30 or @entity6			1
@entity0 , which has been dubbed a next generation messaging service , is just two - years - old and was started by 23 - year - old @entity10 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right )			1
last week the pair filed a restraining order against @entity35 , who co-founded the app , to cease and desist from making any more information public according to sources , mr @entity10 thinks the app ’s user numbers have lots of potential to grow and just two months ago , the company ’s usage had reportedly risen dramatically to 350 million messages a day , from 200 million in june			1
however , the company does not disclose its numbers and has not commented on the rumours			0
the offer comes one week after @entity30 , another popular but unprofitable messaging service , realised a market value of approximately $ 25 billion after its ipo and image sharing app @entity54 raised $ 225 million from investors who valued the company at a huge $ 3.8 billion			1

this latest funding brings the total investment in the firm to $ 123m			0
almost half a million of that came from @entity70 who left his role as chairman of @entity73 to join @entity0 earlier this year			2
other investors include @entity75 and @entity76 @entity77 , an entrepreneur co-founder of venture - capital firm @entity78 , said : ‘ there is no shame in getting an @entity82 result , but there is tremendous glory in building a stand - alone multibillion - dollar company			0

snapchat has carved a niche in the crowded social media marketplace as its messages disappear after 10 seconds and is popular among 13 to 25 - year - olds – a group that is increasingly less engaged with more established networks			1
@entity6 admitted that while it is making more money via mobile advertising , fewer young teenagers are using its site regularly to chat to friends			1
the social networt reportedly tried to acquire @entity0 last year for $ 1 billion but raised its offer to $ 3 billion , which , if it was accepted , would be @entity6 ’s largest acquisition to date			1

while @entity24 - based @entity0 has no sales of business model , its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds , making it a truly instant service @entity121 , principal analyst at @entity120 believes this could include more personalised narrative content instead of banner adverts			1
‘ if you can create content , whether it is a photo or a video or a story , and get it onto one of these instant messaging apps , it has the potential to go viral so fast because the community of users is so big , ’ she said			0
while the app might have the potential to generate revenue from advertising , some analysts believe @entity0 runs the risk of becoming one of many similar services			2
@entity143 , an analyst at @entity144 , predicts similar young apps will flood the market as more and more people use smartphones			0
‘ there are going to be a dozen companies that look something like this , and @entity6 ca n't buy them all , ’ he said			0
@entity0 was started by @entity10 and @entity32 as a project for one of @entity10 's classes at @entity20 where he was studying product design between 2008 and 2012			1
he told @entity158 that he came up with the idea of a temporary photo sharing and messaging service as a friend of his regretted sending a photo			2
together with @entity32 , he looked at other apps that were deleting text and photos and realised they had a stigma attached to them because content disappeared			0
he spoke about the idea in april 2011 in his product design class for his final project and classmates are said to have balked at the idea of impermanent photos			0
undeterred , the duo built a prototype and realised it was fun and exciting sending temporary photos back and forth and decided to persevere with the idea and turn it into a business			0
mr @entity10 launched the company in september 2011 in his father ’s living room			2
