by @entity0 new research has revealed startling new figures about the cost of childcare - which in some cases makes it financially pointless for mothers to return to work			0
mothers on a low income will lose essentially their entire pay packet to pay for two children in daycare , a study by the @entity9 for @entity11 and @entity10 ( @entity12 ) reveals			0
a woman in a full - time role earning the minimum wage of $ 43,000 will only have one per cent of their income left after paying for daycare for two children			1
a woman in a full - time role earning $ 43,000 ( minimum wage ) will have one per cent of her pay left over after paying for child care for two children a woman in a full - time role earning $ 43,000 will have 36 per cent left if she has one child in full - time care a woman earning the average female income , $ 66,000 , keeps 15 per cent of her income with two children in daycare a woman earning $ 66,000 has 44 per cent of her pay after childcare payments if she has one child @entity9 for @entity11 and @entity10 2014 the research also shows that when parents return to work , the government makes $ 1 billion more in taxes from childcare than they spend in childcare subsidies			1
every year , women with children in child care pay $ 7 billion in taxes			1
however , the government only spends $ 6 billion for childcare subsidies			1
@entity66 commissioned the report to appeal to the government to increase childcare subsidies			1
their advocacy manager , @entity69 , said an increase in subsidies is crucial not only to support working mothers , but also young children - particularly those from low income families			2
' @entity30 's subsidies are well below those of most other developed countries , ' says mr @entity69 , according to @entity79			2
' this is contributing to our low level of female workforce participation and denying too many children from low - income households the opportunity to access quality early learning			0
' in a report last month , @entity12 found that the national average childcare fee has risen by around 150 per cent since 2004 , jumping from $ 30 to $ 75 a day for ' long day ' care			2
parents and childcare workers are all appealing to the government to increase childcare subsidies , to ensure the quality of childcare is not compromised the @entity99 government wants to freeze childcare benefit income thresholds and continue to pause the childcare rebate limit at $ 7500 a child a year			1
both measures apply for three years and between them will save $ 336 million			0
the @entity106 's draft report into the sector will be released tomorrow			0
the final version will be delivered in october			0
