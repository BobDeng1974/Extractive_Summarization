five men who were wrongfully jailed for the 1986 rape of a @entity3 jogger are pursuing $ 52 million in damages from the state in the @entity6			1
it comes just six months after the men - @entity8 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , who are known as the ' @entity14 ' - won a landmark $ 41 million settlement from the city			1
the men , now in their late 30s and early 40s , were wrongly convicted of the vicious rape of a jogger in 1989 - and agreed on a $ 40 million settlement with the city of @entity23 in june			1
the resolution marked the end of a 12 - year legal battle the five men have fought after they spent years in prison as a result of the attack which shocked the nation and led in part to the implementation of mayor @entity33 's clean up of @entity23			1
from left , @entity13 , @entity8 , @entity10 , @entity12 , and @entity11 , pictured in 2012 in @entity23 , settled for $ 40 million for their wrongful conviction for the rape of a 28 - year - old woman in @entity3 in 1989 but are now seeking a further payout but now , they are seeking a further payout and @entity12 said it was justified			1
' when you have a person who has been exonerated of a crime , the city provides no services to transition him back to society , ' he told the @entity49			2
' the only thing left is something like this â€” so you can receive some type of money so you can survive			2
' the men initially filed a $ 250 million civil - rights lawsuit after the overturn of their false convictions in 2002 for acting as a ' wolf pack ' of ' wilding ' youths who attacked 28 - year - old jogger @entity11 in 1989			1
the five men were tried and found guilty of the rape of the investment banker and all served prison time			1
in this april 22 , 1989 file photo , @entity11 , 15 , second from left , and @entity12 , 14 , right , are led from the 24th precinct by a detective after their arrest in connection with the rape and severe beating of a woman jogging in @entity3 she was in a coma for 12 days and was left with permanent damage and no memory of the attack			1
all the men were aged 14 to 16 at the time of their arrest and it was alleged police brutality forced confessions from them			1
they also argued at the time that key dna evidence was ignored during their trial which would have triggered a not guilty verdict			1
the five black and @entity90 men had their convictions overturned in december 2002 , when an investigation discovered @entity85 proof they had not raped her , but that she was attacked by one lone man			1
@entity11 , a convicted rapist already in prison , confessed to acting alone in the assault and the men were freed			1
the agreed a deal , which must be approved by the city comptroller , averages out at roughly $ 1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men			2
that means that @entity13 , who spent 13 years in prison , will receive the largest single payout @entity23 has made in a wrongful conviction case			1
the other four men all served around seven years in prison			1
the men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and @entity23 mayor @entity111 was said to be keen to have the case settled			1
this was in direct contrast to former mayor @entity115 , who argued the original $ 250 million suit was too high because authorities had acted in good faith			0
according to the @entity121 , the city 's @entity119 backed this opinion at the time			0
' the case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted , ' a department spokeswoman said			2
' it 's about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct			0
' the attack on @entity11 occurred on april 19 , 1989			1
it was one of the most notorious crimes in @entity23 history and it mesmerized the nation , serving as a lurid symbol of the city 's racial and class divide and its rampant crime			1
it gave rise to the term ' wilding ' for urban mayhem by teenagers			0
@entity23 was just crime central at that time , ' said former @entity23 detective @entity148 , recalling an era so blood - soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990 , compared with 414 in 2012			1
' you were scared to ride the trains after dark			0
it was such a different place			0
' @entity11 was out jogging in @entity3 on april 19 , 1989 , when she was bound , gagged , raped and beaten nearly to death , a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by @entity23 police			1
from the start , the rape of a 28 - year - old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term ' wilding ' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby			1
the five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions , delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight			2
twelve years later , @entity11 , a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before @entity182 's assault , confessed to the crime , and dna testing tied him to the rape			1
in a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated , prosecutor @entity186 concluded that the boys ' confessions contained ' troubling discrepancies ' and that @entity193 ' description of the attack matched the crime scene			2
a judge vacated the convictions			0
by then , however , the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years			1
in 2002 , @entity201 commissioner @entity200 appointed a panel to produce its own report , which concluded that the boys likely attacked @entity182 before @entity193 did			1
former prosecutor @entity204 , who co-authored the report , said @entity206 erred in dismissing the boys ' confessions entirely			2
' it seems impossible to say that they were n't there at all , because they knew too much , ' he said in an interview			0
lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed			0
' they protect each other , ' said @entity220 , a lawyer for the five			0
' it 's always like this			0
' however , in prison , three of the men , @entity10 , @entity224 and @entity225 said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape			2
mr. @entity12 indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people			0
' i took part in with the beatings of that man , ' he said			0
' if i could go back in time and not do it again , you know , it would have been a whole different story			0
' the men 's lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night			0
when @entity182 was found in the brush , more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed			2
she later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book			0
@entity12 and @entity10 , both 14 at the time , @entity8 and @entity254 , 15 , and @entity13 , 16 , were rounded up and arrested			2
after hours of interrogation , four of them recorded confessions on video , in some cases with the boys ' parents in the room			0
bravery : @entity11 , the @entity11 published a book about her harrowing experience - waiving her anonymity to reveal her recovery and the trauma she experienced at the trials , their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced and at the time , dna testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case			1
in 2002 , a re-examination of the case found that dna on the victim 's sock pointed to @entity11 , a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger			1
then - district attorney @entity283 stopped short of declaring the @entity14 innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial			0
( the statute of limitations for charging @entity193 had run out ; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes			0
) @entity290 , one of the lawyers for the five , said the dna was the key			0
' there was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case , ' he said			0
' in 1989 , everybody might not have been forensic savvy , but now , after ' @entity299 , ' everybody knows if there 's no dna , they did n't do it			2
' but an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police			0
legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake			0
the two - hour documentary , ' the @entity14 , ' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted			2
the film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families , and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case			0
the defendants ' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy			0
@entity12 sold drugs and was sent back to prison , but now , along with @entity10 and @entity224 , has become the public face of the case , speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling .			0
