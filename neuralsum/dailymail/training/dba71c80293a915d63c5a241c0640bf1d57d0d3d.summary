by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 minister is involved in an extraordinary row over claims that taxpayers ’ money was used to fund gay sex parties			1
the politician is said to have been in a feud with a senior party official accused of using dating app @entity13 to invite gay mps and activists to his suite at the @entity3 conference			1
the £ 70,000 - a - year official , who is not an mp , has also been accused of bullying staff and being drunk on duty			1
he was disciplined after a formal investigation			0
the £ 2,500 per night @entity24 hotel where the orgy is said to have taken place neither the minister nor the official can be named by @entity29 for legal reasons			1
the gay sex party is alleged to have taken place at the @entity33 , a luxury apartment complex in @entity24 where suites cost up to £ 2,500 a night			1
it is just over half a mile from the @entity38 conference centre and is popular with footballers and wags			0
the complex can be entered by driving straight into the underground car park , escaping the attentions of the paparazzi			0
the official was among a group of @entity3 aides who stayed there during the conference in 2011 with the bill being footed by a taxpayer - funded organisation			1
the @entity3 official organised the party using the @entity13 app , which enables users to make contact with fellow gay men in the vicinity			1
after a series of intimate exchanges with another man , he invited him to a party in his hotel suite			2
it is alleged that other men were later invited			0
according to one source , the official boasted he was a senior figure in the @entity70			0
rumours of several unseemly scandals that are yet to break have been compared to the underhanded politics of television show @entity74 a source , who has seen the @entity13 messages , said : ‘ the gist of it was , “ i ’m up here with the @entity70 and have some great young guys in my suite			2
we party every night , come and join us			2
” ‘ the other man responded very enthusiastically and said he was also involved in politics so they had lots in common			0
’ shortly after the conference , a formal complaint was made to the party by an individual who saw the @entity13 exchanges between the named official and the other man , who did not disclose his identity			1
@entity95 is planning emergency talks with mps in an attempt to defuse any impending crisis a @entity3 insider said : ‘ it was clear from the investigation that the official had behaved very foolishly and he was given a formal warning			1
‘ but it was decided to take no further action			0
the identity of the other man in the @entity13 messages was not disclosed in the inquiry			2
’ the result of the investigation was reported to @entity112			0
the @entity29 has also learned that in the run - up to the 2011 @entity3 conference , the same official was involved in a separate incident when the @entity3 politician involved in the feud asked him to approve a big pay rise for one of his friends , who worked for the the official			1
the official refused , insisting that because the @entity3 body that he and the minister ’s friend worked for receives public funds they had to follow mr @entity130 ’s call for public - sector workers to receive low pay rises in line with the @entity135 ’s austerity policies			1
@entity3 chiefs backed the official and told the minister to stop making a fuss			2
the minister allegedly complained vehemently again when the same male junior aide was passed over for promotion and ‘ raved and ranted about it in front of other @entity3 officials causing an embarrassing scene ’			2
the claims were disclosed following a @entity29 investigation amid speculation at @entity150 that a new sleaze scandal involving @entity3 mps , sex , abuse of power , bullying and personal feuds is about to be exposed			1
a parliamentary insider said some of the ‘ outlandish and sinister ’ claims and counter claims were reminiscent of the tv political drama @entity74 about the plots , sexual intrigue and vendettas in the @entity150 underworld			0

the charter says they must stop all forms of ‘ harassment – unwanted conduct that violates people ’s dignity ’ while ‘ remarks based on race , gender , sexual orientation and gender reassignment ’ are banned			0
