@entity1 ’s criticism of @entity3 ’s punditry split football opinion , with fans arguing over whether he is a breath of fresh air or a pain in the neck			1
here are some of the best comments from @entity12			2
he might not be perfect , but he ’s not the worst pundit			1
this just stinks of jealousy ! ! ! @entity16 , @entity17 i can not understand anything @entity3 says , i think he struggles to actually speak , especially when he is commentating ! and the way he shouts at the microphone is awful ! ! possibly the worst pundit around , and i use that term loosely ! @entity25 , @entity26 former @entity27 midfielder @entity3 ( left ) makes a point to fellow pundit @entity29 on @entity30 @entity3 appears as a pundit on @entity32 , @entity34 television and @entity35 @entity36 ( left ) was caught muttering an expletive about @entity3 under his breath on @entity39 click here to read why @entity3 rubs @entity1 up the wrong way totally agree			1
@entity3 is only interested in promoting himself			1
his points are nonsensical and the only reason i think he makes them is to get himself more airtime			2
when he is on 606 , i switch the radio off			2
lets be equal , @entity47 i like him			2
he is informative and entertaining			0
if everyone was the same there would be no need for tins of assorted biscuits			0
@entity53 , @entity54 i bought @entity35 broadband so that i could watch the matches			1
but this dumbing down blokey fletch and @entity60 stuff is horrendous — a throw - back to the 1980s @entity61 and @entity62			0
i thought football presentation had grown up			0
@entity64 , @entity65 one of the harshest most uncalled for articles i have ever read			0
sure the guy is n’t an amazing pundit but he ’s by no means terrible and at least he ’s honest and does n’t pull any punches			2
cheer up , there ’s bigger things to worry about in the world			0
@entity73 , @entity74 think about it for a moment ; a bunch of executives sat around a table and decided that @entity3 would make a good pundit			1
he ’s just one of a number of pundits on radio and television who ca n’t actually speak @entity86 properly			2
tuesday wednesday , @entity87 @entity88 ( above ) was left unimpressed by @entity3 ’s recent defence of a @entity91 challenge 1 - ‘ you need to take off your rose - scented glasses ’ — responding to a caller on his saturday radio phone - in			1
2 - ‘ football is easy ’ — insight during @entity99 ’s @entity98 win against @entity100 on sunday			0
3 - ‘ outside the box , that ’s a free - kick but inside the box , i do n’t think it ’s a penalty ’ — rewrites the rule book while discussing a contentious decision			0
4 - ‘ @entity108 is stupid ’ — the second most booked player in the @entity110 slams the style of @entity108 at the @entity112			2
5 - ‘ @entity113 crossed every i and dotted every t ’ — defends @entity116 after he quit @entity27 to join @entity117 in september , 2004			1
well do n’t watch him & watch something else			0
some of us quite like him actually			0
@entity120 , @entity121 i never liked him as a player and never liked him as pundit			1
i do n’t normally dislike people but seriously , i do n’t know why , but when it comes to @entity127 , i just had to change the channel			0
@entity129 , @entity47 i do not rate @entity3 as the brightest spark in the box but he is not the @entity34 ’s only problem			1
we have all the same faces popping up as presenters of short documentaries , on quiz games , on reality shows for so called stars , talk shows , drama etc. i for one could do with seeing less of @entity142 and @entity143			0
@entity144 , @entity145 @entity60 ’s great ... and the rest of the @entity35 panel			1
it ’s like mates chatting about footie			0
not as straight laced as @entity30 ! ! ! ! @entity151 , @entity152 i like @entity3 , think he ’s a top guy and quite funny			1
fans will always criticise pundits because sometimes they say things we do n’t agree with and so automatically they become a bad pundit , which is daft really because at the end of the day it ’s only their opinion on how the game went or how a player performed ! so i ’m not bothered who ’s on motd or any other football show because i have my own opinions and i like to hear other people ’s opinions			1
@entity170 , @entity171 the @entity172 competed alongside dancer @entity173 in the 2011 season of @entity175 i did n’t like him as a player — total wind - up merchant , but i actually quite like him as a pundit			1
he ’s not afraid to say what he really thinks , which at least makes it a bit more interesting than the usual monotonous drivel			0
@entity184 , @entity47 at least this man has played the game at a high level			0
show us your international caps ... no , thought not			0
@entity191 , @entity192 the way he criticises others , you would think he was a @entity195 as a player			2
@entity197 , @entity198 @entity3 dressed up in a canary yellow suit to promote @entity35 ’s coverage of transfer deadline day			1
