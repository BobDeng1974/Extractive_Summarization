@entity0 wants to forget his @entity2 captaincy debut as quickly as possible			1
the @entity4 striker had skippered @entity2 on several occasions before , but his first match as full - time captain came on saturday when @entity8 travelled to @entity9			1
@entity0 equalised @entity11 's opener with an acrobatic volley but could not find another , and @entity8 ran out 2 - 1 winners thanks to @entity16 's 72nd - minute winner			1
' it was a proud moment but a disappointing result , ' he told @entity27			1
' it 's not one i 'll look back on and remember with fond memories			0
' you always want to win			0
it was a nice moment , but i 'm disappointed we lost			0
' saturday 's match was an afternoon of firsts			0
@entity2 manager @entity36 got his first taste of @entity39 football - although it will be one he wants to get out of his mouth quickly			1
good time : @entity0 scored the equaliser for the home side but his day did n't get any better as @entity2 lost @entity43 and @entity44 made their debuts , and for @entity48 it was the first time he wore the prestigious @entity50 shirt			1
@entity51 owned that jersey for the last two decades , so the diminutive @entity53 felt pride - and pressure - when he pulled it on at the weekend			0
' it was a big honour for me and my family and i was very happy to have it given to me , ' the young midfielder said			0
tactics : @entity36 's new 3 - 5 - 2 formation struggled to break down the @entity63 visitors on a tough day ' there is pressure on me because there was a legend in front of me who had it for 20 years , but i am really happy with that			2
' @entity48 was keen to stress nothing should be read into the defeat , which came as a big shock given that @entity8 are among the favourites to be relegated this year			1
' it was a very disappointing match but it 's only the first one of the season so it 's nothing , ' said @entity48 , who came on for the injured @entity44 in the first half			2
' we 'll move on to the next one now			0
' legend in the making ? @entity48 took over @entity51 ' no 11 shirt and he looked decent at times @entity48 thinks @entity2 are better - equipped to recover from a setback now than they were under @entity85 , the man who led @entity2 to victory over @entity8 this time last year but ended the year in seventh			1
' a lot of things have changed , ' @entity48 said when asked about @entity17 's impact at the club			1
' he is a top , top manager and we respect him a lot			0
we are working hard for him , the team and everyone else at the club			0
' he was honest with us after the match but it 's only the first game			0
' those @entity2 fans worried about the state of their defence were given further cause for concern on saturday			2
there was a lack of cohesion and focus from the back five , which turned into a back four after the break as @entity17 ditched his 5 - 3 - 2 system			2
vice-captain : @entity112 was just as upset as @entity0 with the way @entity2 surprisingly fell apart @entity2 's vice-captain @entity112 was unhappy both goalscorers were unmarked when they beat @entity116			1
' we conceded bad goals , ' @entity112 said			2
' for me it felt like @entity8 scored with their first attack			0
' we started the second half very well and got back into the game and then they sucker - punched us again			2
' it felt like they had only two chances in the game and they 've managed to score them both			2
that 's hard to take and disappointing			0
" on the other hand : @entity16 had a dream @entity8 return , scoring the winner at @entity9 @entity16 , meanwhile , could not think of a better place to score on his second debut for @entity8			1
' getting three points at @entity9 is always special , but to score the winner here has been a dream for me ever since i was young , ' said @entity16 , who returned to @entity8 this summer following a two - year spell at @entity141			1
' it is one of the biggest stadiums in the world			0
