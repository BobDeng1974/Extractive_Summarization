marked man : ' @entity0 ' , the @entity1 militant who has murdered several @entity3 hostages , is being hunted by @entity5 intelligence @entity7 has told @entity5 spy chiefs to track down @entity9 ' so that special forces can move in to get him dead or alive , it was claimed today			1
mr @entity7 summoned the heads of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 to @entity15 , his country residence , to tell them hunting down the @entity5 - born militant is now their top priority , according to reports			1
the new orders come after friends and relatives of @entity24 , the @entity5 aid worker executed by the militants last week , accused the government of not doing enough to secure his release			1
just 12 hours after the video apparently showing mr @entity24 's murder was published online , spy chiefs gathered at @entity15 to brief mr @entity7 on what they know , the @entity28 reports			1
according to the paper , intelligence chiefs told the prime minister that information on the whereabouts of the militants is not yet reliable enough to launch a special forces raid			1
citing unnamed sources , it claimed intelligence agencies were ' working around the clock ' to locate @entity0 and his comrades , with the majority of @entity12 's efforts now directed at the threat from @entity48			1
the report contradicted claims made in the @entity51 , according to which @entity0 had been tracked to the @entity48 city of @entity54 , an @entity1 stronghold			1
@entity56 drones flying high over the city in north - east @entity48 were said to have not only spotted the militant , whose face is covered when he appears in videos , but also hostages wearing orange jumpsuits			2
but , the report claims , military chiefs have ruled out a rescue operation because @entity1 defences are too strong			1
@entity69 bosses have instead advised the @entity70 that a sustained bombing campaign lasting several weeks would be preferable , it says			2
a source said : ‘ the imagery from the drones and satellites is instructive but is infrastructure in @entity54 would have to be targeted over a sustained period to make any sort of raid a realistic possibility			2
‘ on the basis of our current advice there is very little chance of the prime minister signing off a rescue bid			1
the prospect of success has got to be 100 per cent or thereabouts , and at the moment it is nowhere near that			2
and for now there are not many other options on the table			2
' while sightings of @entity0 are useful , as was establishing his identity , we are still a long way off getting a hit on him			2
right now a raid would be suicidal			2
’ it is not clear which report is most reliable , but last night , after his meeting with intelligence chiefs , mr @entity7 indicated he would be willing to deploy special forces units such as the @entity106 ( @entity106 )			1
' the murder of @entity24 was absolutely appalling , ' he said			1
' it is senseless ; it 's completely unforgivable			0
anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is and barbaric it is as an organisation			0
' what we see with this organisation is that there is no level of depravity to which they will not sink			0
the fact that this was a kind , gentle , compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others , the fact they could murder him in the way they did shows what we are dealing with			0
' we must do everything we can to defeat this organisation			0
we must take action against it and we must find those responsible			0
he was murdered last week by @entity141 miltants @entity5 intelligence and security agencies are already working closely with the @entity144 and @entity145 to find @entity0 and his group of kidnappers in what is now a high - profile murder and counter-terrorism investigation			0
@entity12 and @entity151 , aided by @entity14 communication monitoring , have identified the @entity5 man believed to have carried out the beheadings of two @entity156 journalists and two @entity5 aid workers			0
this information has been shared with a team of more than a dozen @entity156 investigators from an @entity161 , from the @entity156 agency ’s counter-terrorism command , who are reported to have flown to the @entity5 in the past few weeks			0
the jihadi nicknamed ‘ @entity0 ’ by the hostages he was holding – because he and the other @entity5 jihadis were known as @entity169 – is understood to come from a suburb of @entity171			0
it is believed his family members have been interviewed by @entity175 officers and an @entity144 agent			0
meanwhile , teams from @entity13 and @entity145 have deployed field officers in @entity48 to help pinpoint the exact location of the group of kidnappers			1
these teams have picked up valuable intelligence gathered by their agents operating within is ranks			0
the @entity156 @entity185 has offered a £ 6million reward for any information that will lead to the capture of ‘ @entity0 ’ .			0

@entity7 ordered spy chiefs to @entity15 after killing of @entity24
they reportedly told him they *'ve* been unable to pin down militants ' location
prime minister indicates he is prepared to send in @entity106 once he has a target
