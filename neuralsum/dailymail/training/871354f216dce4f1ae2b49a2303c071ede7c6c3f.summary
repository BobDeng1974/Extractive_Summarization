after a disastrous @entity1 for @entity2 , goalkeeper @entity0 is now feeling the pressure to turn things around at @entity5			1
@entity0 appeared to be the target of jeers from some @entity5 fans - while others chanted his name in support - during @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 loss saturday to crosstown rival @entity12			2
the jeers started after @entity5 had conceded a goal to @entity12 midfielder @entity14 from a corner kick , when @entity0 failed to attack a tight cross			0
once widely considered among the best goalkeepers in the world , @entity0 ’ reputation was dealt a serious blow at the @entity1 when @entity2 conceded seven goals in their opening two defeats that meant an early end to their title defense			0
@entity5 have conceded a total of six goals in their last two league defeats and trail both defending champions @entity12 and league leaders @entity44			0
@entity5 have lost consecutive games against @entity47 and then city rivals @entity12 this season @entity0 was not the club 's first choice last season but is back between the sticks this year @entity0 had only recovered his place in the starting line - up at the club from @entity57 at the start of this season after losing it two seasons ago under former coach @entity62			1
@entity63 made @entity0 his starter in the @entity65 and the @entity67 last season , with @entity5 winning both titles			2
@entity5 sold @entity57 this summer , but signed @entity69 after his outstanding @entity1 for @entity70			1
so if @entity0 falters , @entity69 is waiting .			0

@entity22 goalkeeper has regained no 1 spot this season
@entity63 sold @entity57 this summer *allowing* @entity22 no 1 to take his starting spot back
but @entity5 also signed @entity70 star @entity69
some fans turned on @entity0 after @entity5 conceded six goals in two defeats
