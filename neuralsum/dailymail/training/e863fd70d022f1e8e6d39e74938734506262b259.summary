on top of the outright confession , he said that part of the reason why it carried on for as long as it did was because he ' did n't feel like ' he was cheating			0

they said they bought the books ' it 's @entity234 ' and ' @entity235 ' because they believed in @entity2 and his story of returning without drug assistance to the @entity26 after a nearly fatal bout with testicular cancer			2
following @entity2 's doping confession , however , @entity207 and @entity208 said they felt ' duped , ' ' cheated ' and ' betrayed ' by the realization that the books , marketed as inspirational true - life memoirs , were replete with fabrications			2
