@entity3 , 102 , could very well be @entity18 's fittest great grandmother after she completed 102 squats on her birthday this year she 's a great - grandmother but that does n't stop @entity3 working out five days a week incredibly @entity3 was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis and while some may like to take it easy on their birthday , @entity3 decided to complete her most impressive feat yet in celebration of her special day earlier this year			1
‘ last year my physio @entity31 said i 'm going to get you to do 102 squats for your birthday , i said ' you have to be joking ' , ’ @entity3 told the @entity30			1
‘ i 've never really exercised			0
when i was young i did the @entity34 and all the activities that came with that , ’ she added			0
‘ but later it was mainly walking ; my eldest girl was about 15 or 16 before we had a car so we used to walk to the train station when we wanted to go somewhere			0
’ physio @entity42 has been working with @entity3 , a mother of four daughters , for a number of years , and when they first met the 102 - year - old was not nearly as fit as she is now			1
one of her four daughters @entity47 said her mother was never really into exercise when she was younger but she did enjoy riding horses in her leisure time - pictured here on horseback with her husband @entity54 @entity3 initially took a bit of persuading to start exercising but once she started she did n't look back ‘ initially we worked on basic standing balance exercises			1
she could manage about two minutes before fatiguing , ’ @entity31 told @entity30			0
a few years earlier @entity3 had broken her pelvis in three places , at the age of 93 , and needed to be rehabilitated after that			1

‘ it was in late december last year that i initially suggested to @entity3 that she should do one squat for every year of her life ' , ’ @entity31 said			1
‘ i tried persuading @entity3 over several days , initially to no avail , however as @entity3 has such a lovely and selfless spirit i suggested that she could use the opportunity to raise money for a charity			2
‘ ( this was ) an idea which @entity3 jumped at , and with that motivating drive we are where we are today			2
' ‘ at first i was going to do it for the children in the third world countries , ’ @entity3 revealed			2
‘ then i thought i 've been in the @entity92 ( of @entity18 ) for about 15 years and i thought well … i ’ll do it for them ’			0
one of her four daughters @entity47 said although her mother was never really into exercise , the improvement she has seen in her in recent years has been phenomenal			0
' one of the biggest differences we 've noticed is the emotional difference , ' @entity47 told @entity30			0
' @entity103 has a lot more of a positive outlook , she has always been positive ... ( but ) there 's definitely a difference in her contentment			0
the 102 - year - old has always loved being outdoors - especially with horses @entity3 's fitness involves some singing , balance activities , weights , and a little bit of cardio ' she 's still very well mentally , she is very interested in politics and current affairs			1
' a few months on @entity3 now has some tough competition as her friend @entity120 , who is nearly 92 , has also joined in exercising with her , and is getting very good at her squats			1
‘ @entity120 , @entity122 and i come up here straight after breakfast i do the pedals while we sing @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128 , ’ @entity3 said			2
‘ @entity120 has just lately started doing the squats , she can do about 100 but she does them quicker than me			2
she does about two or three to my one , but i go all the way down			0
' the exercise is making a big difference for @entity3 not only physically but also mentally who turned 102 on january 31 @entity3 was given a silver medal from the president of @entity138 , her home country , on her birthday the gym and exercise classes at the @entity17 aged care facility where @entity3 lives have proved very popular ‘ i love it ! ' @entity120 told the @entity30 with great enthusiasm			1
‘ i would n't stay without it			0

‘ sometimes we have six , sometimes we have nine			0
one time we even had ten people come , ’ @entity3 revealed			2
