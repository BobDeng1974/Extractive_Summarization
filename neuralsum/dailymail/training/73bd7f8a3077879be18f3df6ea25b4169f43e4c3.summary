the dog joins them at the table for his special meals cute : @entity18 comes up in a rash if he eats normal dog food so owner @entity15 cooks him special meals every day @entity18 comes out in a rash if he eats tinned or dry food so @entity15 , 24 , makes him cooked meals			1
she said : ' he loves it			2
' i coordinate our meals and make his dinner at the same time as mine			2
' ever since i put him on human food he has been fine and had no problems			2
my vet said it ’s fine			2

she spends £ 5 a day on @entity18 ’s special diet and even makes him a packed lunch if he has to go out			1

a big bag would last ages , but i buy fresh chicken , sweet potatoes and all his other favourites			2
' i probably spend about £ 10,000 a year on him			1
i am quite an extravagant person			2
most people who know me would expect this kind of thing from me			0
it ’s only the people that do n’t know me that think it ’s weird			0
it ’s just the sort of person i am			0

i have to do it , ' @entity15 , from @entity78 , west @entity79 , added			1

the 14 month old pup comes out in an itchy rash every time he goes near normal dog food			1
he scratched himself so much once his skin became infected , leaving him with painful sores all over his body			0
tests by a dermatologist showed the canine was allergic to beef , lamb , cow 's milk and even barley , so owner @entity15 decided to test him on a diet of human food			1

it was pretty horrible when he was scratching all the time - it was quite distressing to see			0
@entity106 1/2 can @entity107 ( 25g ) @entity108 : 61p chicken breast £ 1.50sweet potato @entity109 : £ 2 per meal special diet : @entity18 enjoys meals of chicken breast and sweet potato instead of ordinary dog food ' i took him to the vets who ran blood tests which showed he had some allergies to beef , lamb , cow ’s milk and barley so i cut all those things out of his diet and bought different dog foods but he was still scratching so i took him to a specialist dermatologist			1
' they said his initial blood test was probably done a bit early and he had n’t developed anti-bodies , so i just tried cooking for him one day			0
' i researched it and read on the internet to try not feeding him dog food and it has worked wonders			1
' @entity18 also enjoys @entity138 sausages as part of his daily diet but is still happy to chew on a bone			0
@entity15 , 24 , with her @entity7 , 14 months old , and twin sister @entity25			1

she said : ' dogs can get allergies from quite commons things that humans can get as well			0
' @entity18 has quite a serious problem there			0
we are seeing more and more allergies in dogs but may be we are understanding them more as well			0
we are able to help more now with allergies in dogs and we will test for them			0

' they are n’t simple cases they never are			0
every individual dog is different and it ’s important to make sure people take their dogs to the vet			2
