workers from existing @entity3 countries could be banned from moving to @entity4 if their economy collapses under @entity7 plans to overhaul @entity3 rules , it can be revealed			1
@entity9 has vowed to put immigration at the heart of his plans to renegotiate the @entity4 ’s relationship with @entity14 , before holding an in - out referendum			2
the prime minister has suggested migrants from poor countries joining the @entity3 could be barred from the @entity4 , but is being urged to go further and introduce economic tests for the current 27 member states			1
net migration from @entity3 countries has risen sharply in recent years , hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to march 2014			1
mr @entity9 used his speech to the @entity7 conference yesterday to flesh out his ambitions for securing a better deal from the @entity3			1
he promised that ‘ when it comes to free movement – i will get what @entity4 needs ’			0
the prime minister last year backed the idea of limiting movement by migrants from poorer countries which join the @entity3			1
he suggested ‘ even saying until you reach a proper share of an average @entity3 gdp you ca n't have freedom of movement ’			1
the @entity26 argue that migration between @entity4 and countries with similar economies like @entity52 or @entity53 are balanced			1
but there are ‘ vast movements ’ between poorer country and wealthier countries			2
mr @entity9 proposed saying : ‘ until your economy , until your wealth is similar to our wealth you ca n't have unrestricted movement			1
' @entity9 used his party conference speech in @entity66 to promise tackling freedom of movement rules would be at the heart of his bid to overhaul @entity4 's relationship with the @entity3 while the number of people leaving the @entity4 has remained at around 80,000 , the numbers arriving from the @entity3 have risen sharply a future @entity7 government will scrap the @entity76 , @entity9 said			1
he vowed ' sort out ' the @entity77			0
the @entity78 said the @entity81 court 's rulings had led to ' a whole lot of things that are frankly wrong '			0
mr @entity9 said : ' let me put this very clearly : we do not require instruction on this from judges in @entity81			2
' so at long last , with a conservative @entity92 after the next election , this country will have a new @entity4 @entity94 to be passed in our @entity95 , rooted in our values			0
' and as for @entity97 's @entity76 ? we will scrap it , once and for all			0
' when the idea was floated last year , it was suggested that it would only apply to new countries joining the @entity3			1
but mr @entity9 is coming under @entity104 pressure to use his renegotiation to apply the same rules to existing member states			1
it would mean that if an @entity3 country was hit by an economic crisis and rising unemployment , people living there would not be able to flock to @entity4 in search of work			1
a senior @entity7 source said : ‘ we think it can be done , not just for new countries			2
' you can say this is the level your economy must be at before you can have open borders with @entity4			0
‘ and if for example @entity124 or @entity125 ’s economy collapses below that level , we should be able to say “ you ca n’t come here ”			0
’ one option being explored is to allow countries which use the euro to form much closer bonds , with all those @entity3 countries with own currency to have a much looser relationship with @entity14			2
mr @entity9 has come under intense pressure to quell the rise of @entity138 , following the defections of two @entity141 - @entity140 and @entity142 - and a donor , @entity144 who handed the party £ 1million yesterday			2
in his conference speech , mr @entity9 put immigration ' at the very heart ' of his renegotiation strategy for @entity151 , which he has promised before staging an in - out referendum by 2017			2
he said : ' @entity4 , i know you want this sorted so i will go to @entity14 , i will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement – i will get what @entity4 needs			0
anyone who thinks i ca n't or wo n't deliver this – judge me by my record			0
' i 'm the first prime minister to veto a @entity163 the first prime minister to cut the @entity151 budget and yes i pulled us out of those @entity151 bail - out schemes as well			0
' around that table in @entity151 they know i say what i mean , and mean what i say			0
' so we 're going to go in as a country , get our powers back , fight for our national interest and yes – we 'll put it to a referendum in or out – it will be your choice			0
' and let the message go out from this hall : it is only with a conservative @entity92 that you will get that choice			0

@entity9 promises tackling freedom of movement is *key* to renegotiation
has suggested migration from poorer countries joining @entity3 be curbed
but senior @entity26 believe the limits could apply to existing member states
*policy* aims to stop workers fleeing countries with high unemployment
