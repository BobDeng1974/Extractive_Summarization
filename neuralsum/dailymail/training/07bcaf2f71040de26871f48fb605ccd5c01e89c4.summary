by @entity0 it is one of the earliest examples of natural camouflage ever found - and an ancient relative of the stick insect			1
an international team of scientists said on wednesday they have discovered the fossil of an insect in @entity11 that lived about 126 million years ago whose appearance mimicked that of a nearby plant			0
it is the oldest - known stick or leaf insect that used such natural trickery , they said			1
a fossil stick insect referred to as @entity21 , in @entity22 at the @entity24 locality , a site from the @entity27 period ( @entity28 ) , and a plant fossil , @entity19 ( r ) are pictured in this handout photo courtesy of , @entity32 , a paleontologist with the @entity33 in @entity34			0
there are roughly 3,200 known species of stick and leaf insects , which are members of the insect order known as @entity41 , derived from the ancient @entity43 word for phantom for their ability to seemingly disappear into the background			1
they are also sometimes called a walking stick or a walking leaf and are among the most striking creatures in the insect world , developing unusual shapes to camouflage themselves as vegetation to avoid detection by predators			1
some have flattened , leaf - like shapes , with appropriate color , while others possess cylindrical bodies shaped like sticks or like bark			0
one @entity64 variety , commonly known as @entity66 's megastick , is the world 's longest insect at about 22 inches long			1
the insect , named @entity21 , was found in @entity70 in northeastern @entity11 , part of the @entity24 rock formation that has yielded many stunningly detailed fossils of creatures like early birds and feathered dinosaurs			1
the researchers realized the insect looked remarkably like the leaf of a plant that grew in the same place at the time that was a relative of the @entity85 tree			1
the fossil showed wings with parallel dark lines that , when the bug was in the resting position , seemed to produce a tongue - like shape that could hide its abdomen , they said			0
the plant had similar tongue - shaped leaves marked with multiple lines			0
the researchers think the insect evolved to look like these leaves - even their green color - and concealed itself from predators by mingling with the foliage			0
females of this insect were estimated at about 2.2 inches ( 55 mm ) long and the males a bit smaller			1
the insect is believed to be related to modern stick insects such as those shown here with keeper @entity111 during the annual stock - take at @entity113 ' @entity21 is one of the grand - cousins of today 's stick and leaf insects , ' said paleontologist @entity118 of the @entity119 on @entity120 and @entity121 ( @entity122 ) and the @entity33 in @entity34 , one of the researchers			2
the findings were published in the online journal @entity127			0
@entity21 lived during the @entity27 , the last of the three time periods that make up the @entity129 , sometimes called the @entity129			0
it lived in a warm and wet environment with a large array of plants , dominated by conifers but also featuring relatives of the @entity85 , cycas and others			2
the arrival of small insect - eating birds and agile , branch - walking mammals provided good reason for insects to develop new predator - avoidance strategies like mimicking the appearance of a leaf , @entity118 said			2
the researchers said this insect lacked some characteristics of similar insects seen today , such as a curved part of the front legs that hide the head .			2

55mm long insect looked like a leaf similar to a @entity85 tree
oldest example of an insect blending in with nature ever found
