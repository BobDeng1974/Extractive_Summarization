' on @entity0 's plight , he added : ' everyone understands people struggle at times			2
it 's tough on @entity0 because he had the chance to take a catch and got out early			2
' he 's desperately trying to get himself some form and working very hard to do that			0

but confidence is a massive part of anyone 's game			0
after putting down @entity2 , who got 112 , @entity0 was out lbw to @entity89 for just one ' he 's our most successful test match centurion and has had great success as a one - day player			1
