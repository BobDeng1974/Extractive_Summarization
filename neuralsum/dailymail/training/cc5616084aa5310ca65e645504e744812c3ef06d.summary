and it warns the situation is even deterring some people from signing up to the electoral roll , leaving them unable to vote			2
@entity59 , of the @entity37 , said : ‘ councils resent having to pass the electoral roll onto direct marketing companies			1
' junk mailers and cold callers are a pet hate for many of us			0
it demeans our democracy for the voters ’ details to be sold off as a tool to help direct marketing firms make money			0
critics point out that cash - strapped councils make thousands of pounds a year by selling on voters ' details for as little as 15p - a - go ‘ in some cases people have not signed up to vote because they are concerned about their privacy being compromised			1

details of everyone entitled to vote are included on a ‘ full ’ version of the register , which is not for sale to businesses			0
but a second ‘ open ’ version of the register is also created containing the same names and addresses , except for those who have opted out			0
this contains some 28 million names , which junk mail firms can purchase in electronic form for as little as £ 1.50 per 1,000 entries			2

‘ registering to vote should be a basic part of our democratic freedoms , instead the practice of forcing councils to sell our personal details to anyone and everyone has left people confused about who can get hold of their private information			1
‘ the existence of the edited register is waste of everyone 's time , councils do n't benefit from selling it on and it leaves residents drowning in huge volumes of junk mail , there is no need to keep it and it should be abolished as a matter of urgency			2

councils are currently obliged to sell on data from ' open ' electoral roll
