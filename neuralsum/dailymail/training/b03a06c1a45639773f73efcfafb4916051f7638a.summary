protesters say it 's a ' false and dangerous idea that gay people can and should choose to be straight '
they want @entity1 to cancel the show for its premise that a man can be attracted to another man yet choose to marry a woman to follow his faith
instead of *referring* to themselves as gay , the men use the term ' @entity188 ' , or @entity189
these unconventional marriages are the focus of a new @entity1 special called @entity18 's @entity17 , set in @entity76
according to the @entity144 , same sex attraction ' itself is not a sin , but acting on it is '
