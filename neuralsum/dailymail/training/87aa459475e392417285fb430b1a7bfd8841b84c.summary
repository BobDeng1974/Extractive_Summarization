by @entity0 last updated at 10:58 am on 17th january 2012 a young mother whose father killed himself two days before he was due to stand trial for her murder was found dead by a group of children , an inquest heard			1
the skull of @entity9 , 19 , were found by the youngsters in woodland in @entity12 , @entity13 , five months after she had disappeared			1
but despite being missing for so long , none of her friends or family had reported her missing			2
yesterday a coroner ruled that she had been unlawfully killed			0
' unlawfully killed ' : @entity9 , 19 , was found dead in woodland by a group of children , the inquest heard police found more human remains nearby including her femur and pelvis after the children stumbled across her skull in october 2008			1
the single mother 's father @entity30 , 46 , killed himself in his prison cell just before he was due to stand trial at @entity34 , the inquest in @entity36 was told			1
@entity13 coroner @entity37 said it was ' one of the most significant and difficult ' cases he had dealt with			0
accused : @entity30 , 46 , was due to stand trial charged with murdering his daughter the murder case against her father @entity44 was ' circumstantial ' , the coroner was told			1
as the single mother 's remains had been left exposed for several months a cause of death could not be determined - although the pathologist said she may have been strangled			2
but detective chief inspector @entity50 , from @entity52 ’s major crime branch , said that ' taken cumulatively ' there was ' good reason ' for @entity9 to be charged and to stand trial			1
the inquest heard that @entity9 was suspected to have sent text messages purporting to be from his daughter after she had been killed			1
these included texts sent to her mother , @entity61 , with whom @entity9 had split , saying she had set up home with a new boyfriend			2
mr @entity50 said : ' a text expert examined the texts purporting to be sent by @entity66			0
he came to the view that it was very likely that the texts were sent by @entity44			0
' a phone used to send texts claiming to be from ms @entity9 had been bought by a man fitting her father ’s description at a shop			2
a walking stick was also bought , which @entity9 had cause to use			0
other reasons to suspect she had been killed included the fact that her body had possibly been concealed , and that she had not taken any money or possessions with her			0
there was also no contact with friends or family , including her own daughter , and there were ' lies and inconsistencies ' in @entity9 ’s accounts to police , mr @entity50 said			0
murder scene : the remains of ms @entity9 were discovered by children in woodland in @entity12 , @entity13 @entity9 had told police that he had not reported her missing because she had vanished on previous occasions and was on a final warning with social services			1
he claimed to fear that social services would take away his grandchild but the authorities denied to police that she had been given a ' final warning '			0
according to mr @entity50 , @entity9 had 11 convictions ranging from theft to firearms offences			0
at around the time of her disappearance , ms @entity9 was seen outside the house she shared with her father in @entity12 , and was heard to say : ' i have had enough			2
' later that day , a neighbour called at her home and was told by @entity9 that she had gone out			2
mr @entity50 said the prosecution would have said at trial that @entity9 had disposed of her body in his car , which he sold 12 days later			1
he also said he had lost his mobile phone shortly after she disappeared , which police said would have been of important evidential value			0
@entity126 , deputy general manager of surgery at the @entity128 in @entity12 , said that ms @entity9 had surgery following a car crash in which her brother @entity131 , 17 , died in november 2005			1
this resulted in her being fitted with pins and screws with a unique reference number which helped identify her , along with dental records .			0

@entity9 's father @entity44 , 46 , was charged with murder but he killed himself before standing trial
none of her *relatives* reported her missing - even though she was missing for five months , inquest told
her older brother @entity131 was killed in a car crash three years before she died
