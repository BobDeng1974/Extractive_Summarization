the inferno ripped through @entity12 on may 11 , 1985 during the first half of a game against @entity15 , before which @entity4 had received the @entity17 title			1
a minute 's silence will be held this weekend for the 56 supporters who lost their lives during the @entity4 fire disaster @entity7 supporting efforts to raise £ 300,000 for the @entity21 and @entity22 at the @entity23 a blaze tore through @entity12 's main stand during a @entity17 match against @entity15 on may 11 , 1985 players , managers and fans will stand for a minute to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster , which also left 265 injured supporters watch on as the fire rips through @entity4 's ground - and have had no definitive answers to questions they asked many fans were trapped in their seats and 265 people were injured as the fire engulfed the main stand within minutes			1
the top four tiers of the game will remember them this weekend			1
and the top four tiers of the game will mark their passing this weekend			1
the @entity7 will be supporting efforts to raise £ 300,000 for the @entity21 and @entity22 at the @entity23			1
@entity46 , the co-chairman of @entity4 , said : ‘ i am personally delighted that the @entity47 , the @entity7 and @entity6 have got involved			1
i would like to remind people that the @entity49 is solely reliant on charitable donations by the public , charitable organisations and businesses , and has no funding from the government			0
‘ i am extremely pleased that @entity4 has helped to fund the @entity49 through the supporters raising money			1
this has been enough over the years to help maintain and exceed the standards coming from the unit			0
’ there are harrowing stories of almost entire families passing away that day in @entity64 and serious questions still remain as we head into a fourth decade since the tragedy			2
they are laid bare in @entity70 ’s new book , @entity71 – the story of the @entity75 , in which the author challenges accepted theories as to the cause			0
nobody has been made accountable for events which saw fletcher lose his brother @entity81 , 11 , his father @entity82 , 34 , his uncle @entity83 , 32 , and his grandfather @entity82 , 63			2
@entity70 has been researching the fire for 15 years and believes the investigation ’s findings are flawed			0
the inquiry asserted that the cause was , in all likelihood , down to a cigarette or a match dropped on to a pile of rubbish			0
he found that former chairman @entity96 , who died in 1995 aged 61 , had been connected with at least eight other business fires and insurance claims			0
@entity99 , the man commentating on the game when fire broke out , was candid in @entity102 last week thousands watched on horrified as the flames took control of the stand to devastating effect the variance in theories suggests , as with @entity111 , a new investigation would be vindicated , offering potential closure for the city @entity70 ’s new book – fifty - six – the story of the @entity75 – challenges accepted theories as to the cause of the fire			1
there were many cases of heroism , with more than fifty people receiving police awards or commendations @entity99 , the man commentating on the game when fire broke out , was candid in @entity102 last week and refuted @entity70 ’s claims			2
‘ @entity70 lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything i have been told there is n’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately , ’ he wrote			0
‘ on the contrary , i remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started			0
detective inspector @entity143 actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire			2
‘ this corroborates what i was told at the time by the coroner			0
he said it was believed the fire had been started by a man , visiting this country from @entity155 , but his name was never revealed			0
‘ without making allegations against the club ’s chairman at the time @entity96 , there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased @entity96			0
as members of his own family were seated in the stand that day , and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later , it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson			2
’ a solitary bottle of champagne stands on the terrace - bradford had been celebrating winning the @entity17 title earlier in the day @entity4 manager @entity180 looks ahead on the @entity12 pitch in front of the burnt out stand an aerial shot of the smoke - showing the scale of the fire to engulf @entity4 's ground and shock @entity1 football forensic experts sift through debris in the area where the fire started on may 11 , 1985 then prime minister @entity192 and husband @entity193 lay a wreath near a turnstile where many of the victims were found the variance in theories suggests , as with @entity111 , a new investigation would be vindicated , offering closure to a city that still has no definitive answer			1
this weekend will be the first time the whole of @entity1 football has come together and remembered the @entity4 56 in unison			1
and the club has only recently wanted to fully remember the victims publicly			0
the memorial at @entity12 was n’t erected until 2001 and years went by without the anniversary even getting a mention in programmes and there were no silences or black armbands			1
‘ i do feel we missed something of an opportunity in the aftermath of the fire , ’ former chairman @entity215 said in 2011 , when @entity12 celebrated its 125 years as a sporting venue			2
‘ i think we should have looked at starting from scratch in another location			0
this picture shows what damage the fire caused in such a short space of time , with an entrance completely obliterated @entity12 looked derelict in the immediate aftermath but @entity4 opted to stay at their home and moved back months after the scene at @entity4 's memorial service to mark the passing of supporters who died in the fire firemen survey the damage and put out any remains of the fire after bringing it under control a policeman watches the forensic team pore through evidence on the terracing at @entity4 ‘ the fire was , of course , a horrible time			1
fifty - six people lost their lives and the effect on the city was huge , and probably something that ca n’t be put into words			0
you had to be in @entity4 at that time to understand just what the city went through			2
‘ i had returned to the board in 1983 with @entity96 ( @entity257 , @entity4 chairman at the time of the fire ) to save the club			2
' but then the fire happened ... ' the planned minute ’s applause at last season ’s @entity262 final between @entity264 and @entity265 was given a mixed reception by some @entity4 supporters , who still maintain the loss is solely theirs			1
that , though , wo n’t stop hundreds of thousands paying their respects this weekend as the disaster is brought sharply back into public focus			0
fans of all clubs can show their support by donating here .			0

the top four tiers of the @entity1 game will stand for a minute 's silence to mark the 30th anniversary
