a 102 - year - old letter found in a couple ’s attic has revealed that @entity3 was nearly stopped from beginning its doomed voyage			1
the letter , which sold for £ 24,000 at an auction this afternoon , reveals that the large wake caused by @entity3 leaving @entity8 snapped the mooring ropes of two ships , @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity3 was seconds away from hitting @entity11 - but changed direction just in time			1
if the crash had happened it would have without doubt changed the course of history , auctioneers have said			1
‘ we nearly had a collision with @entity11 and @entity12 when leaving @entity8			1
the wash of our propellers made the two ships range about when we were passing them , this made their mooring ropes break and the @entity11 set off across the river until the tugs got hold of her again			0
‘ no damage was done but it looked like trouble at the time			2
keep well and be a good lad			0
‘ regards to mrs @entity53			0

‘ mr @entity25 also ironically describes everything as “ working @entity36 ” on board the liner when she left @entity8			2
‘ the crash would not have been a disaster but would have been bad enough to delay @entity3 for a day or two as the structural integrity of the hull would have needed to be checked			1
without a doubt it would have changed the course of history			2
