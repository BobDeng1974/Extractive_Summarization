the drone of two @entity2 nuclear bombers passing along @entity4 ’s @entity3 and endangering our civilian airliners should be a deafening wake - up call to our leaders about the threat we face from @entity10			1
two @entity12 fighters — which can travel at twice the speed of sound — scrambled on wednesday from @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17 , screeching through @entity4 skies to intercept the @entity19 , unexpected and unwelcome guests off our shores			1
detected first by our @entity23 allies , the @entity2 planes were then ‘ spotted ’ by @entity26 radar stations in @entity27 in @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30			1
in the ultra-secure bunker of @entity33 in @entity34 , home of our @entity35 and @entity37 , @entity26 officers flashed signals to @entity39 , and @entity4 ’s military hq in @entity41 outside @entity42			2
within seconds , the decision was made to scramble the battle - ready @entity45			2
although the @entity48 bombers came with no fighter escorts , and could have been shot down before they had a chance to launch any nuclear warheads , the episode was still a deeply unsettling reminder of @entity10 ’s ceaseless belligerence			2
test : a @entity55 is escorted by an @entity26 jet during an alert in september last year ( file picture )			2
this week 's episode was a deeply unsettling reminder of @entity10 ’s ceaseless belligerence for this is not the first time the @entity63 has recently tested our reactions and resolve : in november , our fighters were scrambled twice in a week when @entity48 bombers were identified over the @entity68 , and there have been scores of other similar incidents in recent years			1
for too long , our defence chiefs have for political reasons played down the @entity2 activity , loath to worsen relations with the @entity63			1
incredibly , back in 2008 , for example , a @entity2 supersonic bomber carried out a dummy nuclear attack on northern @entity79			1
it came within 90 seconds of our airspace before turning away , and had been approaching with a velocity and angle of attack known as ‘ unfriendly posture ’			2
in other words , exactly what it would do if it was on a real bombing run			2
the @entity91 press office flatly denied this had taken place — until disgruntled @entity26 officers leaked the story to the newspapers			2
after this week ’s close encounter — which forced the authorities to reroute civil aircraft over the channel — @entity4 ’s response has been tougher			1
the pin - striped smoothies at the @entity103 — normally a blob of timidity and caution when it comes to relations with @entity10 — scrambled , too , hauling in the @entity2 ambassador to @entity4 for a dressing down			1
we should have done this years ago , for make no mistake , @entity10 ’s aim in all this is to intimidate and humiliate			2
not strong enough to mount a full - scale attack , it can still be hugely menacing			2
on orders from @entity119 , the @entity2 warplanes fly with their transponders — devices which emit an identifying signal — switched off , making them invisible to civilian air traffic			1
it is the aviation equivalent of driving a black @entity126 with its lights switched off at high speed through city streets at night			2
this is insanely risky behaviour			0
in airspace off @entity133 last year , it nearly led to a mid-air catastrophe , when a @entity2 plane came within a whisker of colliding with a civilian airliner that had just taken off from @entity139 airport			1
hundreds of people would have been killed			0
the prospect of a military miscalculation is ever more frightening			0
what happens if one of these @entity2 warplanes is accidentally shot down by an @entity26 pilot , or one from a nervous @entity147 ally ? we would be on the brink of @entity150 so why does @entity119 do it ? defiant : @entity2 president @entity119 believes the @entity152 one reason is that these stunts also bring valuable military information			1
@entity2 electronic snooping devices monitor our reaction times			1
they see how well our pilots are trained , and what our warplanes can do			0
they want to know how they communicate with their bases , and how our chain of command works			0
such electronic intelligence - gathering is supplemented by the work of @entity10 ’s human intelligence assets — spies , in plain language — who recruit and run sources in the defence establishments of @entity147 countries			0
knowing how your adversary reacts in an emergency gives crucial insights into how he will behave in war			0
and it is not just in the air that @entity10 is constantly testing us			2
last year , a @entity2 flotilla of warships — bristling with electronic listening equipment — brazenly sailed up the @entity186 , ostensibly on the way to an exercise in the @entity189			1
the only available vessel in our shrunken @entity191 had to sail at full speed halfway around @entity4 to intercept them			0
and , under the ocean , @entity119 ’s submarines lurk off our naval bases in @entity15 on an even more sensitive mission			1
their task is to listen for the distinctive ‘ acoustic signatures ’ of our nuclear submarines			0
these vessels are the most important in @entity4 ’s arsenal			0
they carry cruise missiles — and four of them are the launching pad for our ultimate deterrent : @entity212			0
but if the acoustic signature is detected , they no longer become invisible , silent killers			0
they are far easier to track — and to destroy			0
the bitter irony is that we ourselves no longer have the capability to identify these @entity2 submarines when they are lurking off our waters			1
five years ago , in one of the most extraordinary fiascos in the history of @entity4 defence procurement , we sacrificed our @entity228 reconnaissance aircraft , which had the capability to locate the @entity2 subs from the air			1
as a result , when @entity2 submarines again shadowed our naval vessels last year , we were forced to call on other countries for help			1
in international airspace and on the high seas , these brushes may seem like a macho game			0
but it could have deadly consequences			0
if @entity10 ’s forces subvert or attack any of the @entity244 — perhaps in the guise of ‘ peacekeepers ’ dealing with a civil war — then @entity4 , as the @entity147 ally of the staunchly @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 , is solemnly bound to defend them			0
in the event of such a crisis , the knowledge acquired by @entity10 from provocations such as this week ’s could be crucial in dealing with anything our armed forces would try to do to fulfil @entity4 ’s @entity147 obligations			2
those , then , are the military reasons behind @entity10 ’s menacing of our borders			0
but there are other motivations for @entity119 to send a nuclear bomber close to @entity268			1
first , there is the @entity152 ’s response to @entity10 ’s invasion of @entity273 and violent incursions into @entity274			0
the sanctions we have imposed are causing @entity119 ’s economy great harm , especially in tandem with the tumbling oil price			1
but i believe this week ’s close call was also in response to the startling events in @entity42 , where a public inquiry has opened into the murder of the @entity2 exile @entity288 in november 2006			1
on its first day , the hearing heard @entity119 accused of being a ‘ common criminal ’ who had ordered the murder			1
as you can imagine , this did not go down well in @entity295			0
@entity288 ’s death by polonium poisoning should have convinced our leaders that @entity10 is a criminal state , run by thugs , prepared to silence its critics with reckless acts of nuclear terrorism			0
closely watched : an @entity12 jets shadows this @entity307 bomber over the @entity308 in september 2007			0
on orders from @entity119 , the @entity2 warplanes fly with their transponders — devices which emit an identifying signal — switched off , making them invisible to civilian air traffic			1
but for years our rulers put the preservation of diplomatic relations with @entity10 ahead of exposing the truth about one of the most infamous murders in our country ’s history — just as they failed for too long to protest to @entity10 about the misbehaviour of its warplanes			0
it is hard to overstate the threat the @entity152 now faces from @entity10 , both in terms of espionage and naked military threats			2
an alleged spy ring was arrested in @entity333 this week , and , yesterday , @entity119 ’s armed forces chief declared that a strong nuclear arsenal will ensure military superiority over the @entity152			1
he promised that the @entity2 military would receive more than 50 new intercontinental nuclear missiles this year			1
@entity119 believes the @entity152 is finished : overstretched , decadent and discredited			1
the truth is we are not losing this spate of arm - wrestles because we are weak , but because our willpower is weak			0
the mighty @entity344 could easily have withstood the assault it faced in its last years			0
but it bickered , fiddled , dithered — and perished			0
@entity346 is @entity347 of @entity348 .			0

this week , two @entity2 @entity19 were intercepted over @entity268
a show of strength by @entity119 , it is a threat that needs addressed
