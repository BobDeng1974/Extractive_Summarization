having set a date for her big day , @entity0 was delighted to be able to get down to the business of choosing her wedding dress			1
so the 31 - year - old booked an appointment at boutique bridal shop @entity7 in @entity8 but miss @entity0 was left devastated after shop workers reportedly told her she was too big to be fitted for a gown			1
she says she was left feeling humiliated after an assistant told her the shop did not stock dresses big enough for her size 16 figure			1
too fat ? bride - to - be @entity0 , size 16 , says she was distraught to be told there was nothing big enough - or that she could afford on her £ 450 budget - in @entity8 bridal boutique by design @entity0 , who is 5ft 2ins , was then told that she would not be able to afford any of the designs in the shop with her budget of £ 450 to £ 500			1
the retail assistant , who lives in @entity8 , said : ' the assistant took one look at me and said there was nothing there that would fit me			1
' she asked what my budget was and said there was nothing there i could afford			0
i was taken aback by her attitude			0
' i was trying to find one super dress for one super day and i just felt completely deflated			0
i was so upset and just wanted to go home			0
' unhappy : @entity0 claims that the boutique told her she was too big for any of their dresses - but manager @entity44 has hit back , saying they were never rude , and tried to accommodate @entity0 the best they could the average @entity47 woman has measurements of 39 - 34 - 41 , putting them into a size of either 14 or 16			1
@entity0 , who is due to get married next august , is now calling for dress shops to accommodate all shapes and sizes to avoid embarrassments for brides - to - be			1
@entity55 , manager at @entity7 , said their dress prices start from around £ 500 - with additional costs for alterations and fittings , and that on the day @entity0 came into the boutique , she said she had a budget of £ 450 to £ 500			1
but he insisted that he always tries to accommodate brides and their budgets , whatever they may be , to help them get a deal that allows them to have the style they want			0
he said : ' this is a difficult subject and we try to handle these situations as sensitively as possible			0
' we are only a small boutique shop and it is a business decision to only stock certain sizes for people to try on			2
' we only carry a certain amount of stock so we are limited to the sizes we have			2
economies of scale : bridal boutique @entity7 said they do n't carry samples in a size zero either			1
' it 's a commercial decision , ' manager @entity44 said			1
' we stock the samples we get asked for most			2
we simply do n't have space to keep everything in store ' ' wedding dresses have to be perfect , but in order to help the customer as best we can we need to know what they can afford			2
' ' we were never rude			0
@entity0 did try on dresses in the shop but unfortunately they were not her size			1
' we do the very best we can but sometimes you just do n't have the stock			2
you ca n't please all of the people all of the time			0
it is very unfair for @entity0 to vilify us for not having what she wanted			2
' you would n't go to @entity105 and ask for a size 10 in a regular length and get upset if they did n't have it			2
' it 's a purely commercial decision to stock the range of sizes we do , and down to economies of scale			1
any clothing retailer would tell you what their specific market is			0
' we do n't stock size zero dresses either			2
not because we have anything against petite people , we just do n't get asked for it enough			0
' we are not a department store ' : the @entity8 boutique says they do their best to help all brides , but that they are limited by space and cost ' the dresses are available throughout all sizes , but we only have a certain amount of space in the store to stock samples available for our customers			1
' you have to stock the sample dresses which we are most likely to sell			0
' in six years of trading we know the majority of our customers want a size 8 to 14			1
' we go no lower than 8 in our samples or higher than 14 - but we 've made both smaller and larger sizes to order			1
' we do our best to keep our customers happy			0
without customers we do n't have a business , after all			0
' @entity145 could absolutely have asked for any of our samples in a size 16 or 18 , but we do have to consider budget			1
' hers was £ 450 to £ 500			0
we try not to restrict people , and we attempt to accommodate all budgets			0
' we do our best to come to a deal they can afford and give them the style that they want			0

@entity0 says she was ' humiliated ' when @entity7 in @entity8 told her they did n't carry samples in size 16
but manager @entity55 says they only carry samples in sizes 8 to 14 . ' it 's a commercial decision . we do n't carry size zero either , ' he said
