by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will be given every chance to extend his @entity5 career by @entity6 after moving to @entity8 ’s @entity7			1
the 36 - year - old former @entity10 midfielder has won 103 caps for his country and has yet to decide whether to follow @entity13 and @entity14 into international retirement			1
but @entity6 ’s director of football @entity16 insists that the @entity19 owned club will support @entity2 if he wants to make himself available for the @entity21 qualifying campaign			1
‘ it would be great for him and great for us as well			2
we signed @entity35 and he was representing us at a @entity36 , so we would never ever tell a player not to play for their national team			2
’ with @entity6 ’s players not reporting for pre-season until january and @entity2 reluctant to follow @entity43 to @entity44 to keep fit with @entity19 ’s other sister team @entity46 , it would be difficult for @entity5 boss @entity47 to select the veteran midfielder if he is effectively without a club for six months			1
however , @entity16 has not ruled out the possibility of @entity2 training with the @entity53 champions in the meantime			1
he added : ‘ it ’s something we ’ll sit down face to face and speak to people – the @entity19 team , the manager , and have those conversations			2
‘ nothing ’s decided yet			0
we need to keep @entity63 and fit , and that ’s what he wants			2
the most important thing for us is that he ’s ready to go in january			0
’ straight into action : @entity2 trains with youth teams in @entity68 after being unveiled eye on the ball : @entity2 practices his skills ( left ) and in his familiar no 8 shirt , but the @entity19 version ( right ) suit you , sir : @entity2 was unveiled by @entity6 's top brass , including @entity16 ( left ) @entity16 also revealed that marquee players like @entity2 and @entity43 have been told not to view mls as a way of making some easy money at the end of their careers			1
‘ it ’s a discussion we have with any player who is coming to @entity7 for the first time , ’ he said			2
‘ all the players are well aware that this is n’t a retirement league			0
we spoke to them and said they have to show up , train , and really carry on being what they ’ve been – model professionals and great players			2
‘ it ’s a very competitive league			0
there are a lot of challenges – weather , travel , the level of the games			0
there are going to be many players and teams motivated to play us because of the players we have			0
‘ certainly in our city , we need big names , star players			0
the fans here identify with it in all sports			0
@entity35 and @entity2 tick all the boxes and hopefully our third designated player will be in the same category			1
‘ @entity7 has done a great job in making sure the league grows at the right pace			1
we need to continue to be mindful of our growth but it is a moment where we ’re ready to take the next step			0
we hope that with some of the other newer franchises , like @entity121 in @entity122 , that we continue with this development			0
come here , you : @entity2 gives @entity23 sporting director @entity16 the runaround when the former played for @entity19 ‘ the league has signed @entity127 , we have @entity128 and other big - name players so it ’s important			1
we ’d like to get players a little bit earlier but at the same time we ’re competing with @entity133 where they are still paid well and playing at the highest level			0
’ @entity16 is delighted that @entity2 decided to move to @entity6 after his 13 - year stay at @entity10 came to an end			1
‘ having spoken to him and his excitement for this new challenge it was really a no - brainer to make him a @entity23 player , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ there are many out there who were interested to come but it was really important that we got the right one			0
end of an era : @entity148 ended his 13 - year association with @entity10 at the end of last season moving on : @entity14 ( left ) and @entity2 left @entity10 at the end of last season - @entity153 ( right ) remains ‘ just seeing that he ’s still where he ’s at and takes care of himself , it makes sense to have someone like him on the field			1
‘ everyone knows what he does – he scores goals , he sets up goals , that ’s the type of player he ’s always been and we intend to use him in the same way			0
‘ we ’re not asking him to do anything different , but for our club it ’s a tremendous boost and the next chapter in our short history			0
’ all white on the night : @entity2 refused to give any indication on his @entity5 future at thursday 's press conference			1

former @entity10 midfielder is yet to decide on his international future
@entity13 and @entity14 have already quit @entity5
@entity16 does not rule out @entity2 training with @entity19
36 - year - old is reluctant to follow @entity35 to @entity46
@entity2 could add to his 103 @entity5 caps if he stays on
midfielder says he plans to keep himself fit over @entity7 break
@entity16 says it would be great for @entity23 if @entity2 continued with his @entity5 career
