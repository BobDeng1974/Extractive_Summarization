but as an expectant crowd gathered to watch him set off on his maiden flight , mr @entity1 's aircraft - perhaps unsurprisingly - threw a wobbler			2
he emerged from the plane after the botched attempt with badly - scratched legs			0
but @entity1 's confidence had not been dented by the experience			2
pride and joy : @entity1 has studied aircraft since he dropped out of school as a 12 - year - old rocket man : the farmer inspects the aircraft that he constructed for only £ 200 using plywood , an old motorbike and old pieces of plastic does that go there : @entity1 said it is his ' dream ' to take to the skies in his aircraft the aspiring aviator told onlookers : ' how could i forget to adjust the throttle in the air ? and the tail is way too big , which made the plane impossible to balance and made the nose go down			1
but i will fix it next time			0
' having dreamt of flying a plane since he dropped out of school as a 12 - year - old child , mr @entity1 decided to act on his dream , constructing the aircraft over the past 11 months			1
after hours of toil , mr @entity1 finally finished the vehicle earlier this month			2
it measures 3.4 metres and weights over 230 kilograms			0
the aircraft could be considered a low - cost investment for the farmer - after he spent only 2,000 yuan ( £ 200 ) on its construction			1
a crowd of locals gathered around the aircraft in @entity59 , @entity60 province , for its first attempted takeoff			1
using a main road as a runway , they gave mr @entity1 a push as he sought to gain momentum			0
after two hours of trying , the enthusiast was forced to give up			0
his determination to soar into the skies though is as strong as ever			0
he said : ' it 's my dream , better than playing cards			0
' mr @entity1 can take inspiration from another amateur aviator from @entity76 province who flew a hand - crafted aircraft in 2008 after spending six years building it			1
ready for takeoff : onlookers give mr @entity1 's plane a push as he attempts to take off for the first time using a main road as a runway up , up and away : the motorbike - come - airplane races along the road as mr @entity1 attempts to leave the ground game over : after spending two hours trying to leave the ground in @entity59 , @entity60 province , mr @entity1 clambered out of the vehicle with badly scratched legs and admitted defeat			2

@entity1 spent 11 months building the aircraft , spending only £ 200
the farmer said it is his ' dream ' to fly and has studied planes since he was 12
