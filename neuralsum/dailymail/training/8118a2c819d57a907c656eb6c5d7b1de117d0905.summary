a ‘ superwheat ’ created by @entity4 scientists could increase crop yields by up to a third			1
in one of the biggest potential advances for farming in a generation , researchers have cross-bred modern wheat seed with ancient wild grass species to produce a more resilient , productive crop			1
researchers at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) said the new ' superwheat ' could be combined with current varieties to boost drought tolerance , disease resistance , as well as their yield			1
good news for farmers : a new ' superwheat ' can increase wheat crop yields by up to 30 per cent ( stock image pictured ) in early field trials , the new crop was 30 per cent more productive than conventional wheat , and could be available to farmers as soon as 2019			1
the process of producing the synthetic ' superwheat ' is similar to selective breeding and does not use genetic - modification			2
it could also spell good news for the consumer , with increased production promising to keep down prices for bread , biscuits and pasta			0
@entity4 is set to become a net importer of wheat for the first time in more than a decade after last year 's terrible weather			1
farmers fear the trend will continue next year , due to planting difficulties and seed shortages			1
earlier this month , it emerged @entity47 's digestives will no longer carry a logo stating the biscuits contain ' 100 per cent @entity50 ' due to sourcing difficulties			0
both @entity52 and @entity53 have also had to drop their sourcing pledges			0
dr @entity56 , from the chief executive and director of @entity13 , said modern cultivated wheat is the result of a cross between durum - used and goat grass that likely occurred in the @entity63 10,000 years ago			1
emerging crisis : @entity4 faces importing wheat for the first time in more than a decade after poor weather last year destroyed crops - with farmers fearing the trend will continue next year the @entity72 - based team selected early wheat and grass varieties from seed banks across the globe and cross-bred them for maximum potential			1
' this year our crop had a 30 per cent better yields , which took us a bit by surprise , ' said dr @entity56			2
' although to is in the early stages , we are very optimistic			0
' in the past decade , our wheat yield had started to plateau off and we needed another increase in productivity to meet demand			2
' it is about finding novel characteristics from the original ancestors of wheat and breeding them to make them as productive and resilient as possible			1
' dr @entity56 said the technique involved breeding selected species of wheat and grass , and that no gm - technology was involved			2
' you can sometimes become too focused on one technology like @entity100 and not look at other techniques that can bring you similar success , ' she said			0
over the next 50 years , the world needs to grow more wheat than has been produced in the 10,000 years since agriculture began			2
@entity107 president , @entity106 , also an arable farmer , said increased production will help keep future prices down			0
' the trials show up to 30 per cent yield increase , which is truly fantastic			0
it is particularly good news , as we had to import wheat following last year 's record wet weather and it will be a similar picture this year with a poor harvest expected			0
' this is about increasing resilience and making ourselves self - reliant			0
we want to be able to feed ourselves and the rest of the world			0

researchers have cross-bred modern wheat seed with ancient wild grass
trials proved the ' superwheat ' crop is more resilient and disease resistant
new wheat could be available to farmers in @entity4 by 2019
