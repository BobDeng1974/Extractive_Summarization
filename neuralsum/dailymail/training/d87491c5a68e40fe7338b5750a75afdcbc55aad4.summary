allergic reaction : @entity8 , 37 , of @entity9 , who was on holiday with her partner and two teenage children in @entity13 , @entity14 , was taken to hospital days after she started using @entity7 1 day @entity28 but miss @entity8 said she was furious when @entity29 , the makers of the popular sun lotion , offered her only a £ 5 refund following her ordeal she claimed was caused by using the product			1
she said : ‘ i thought my time was up			0
i have never suffered anything like that before			0
i first used the cream on wednesday			0
by thursday i had a rash which the local pharmacist said was prickly heat			0
‘ by friday , one eye had swollen over			0
but by saturday i could n't see at all			0
i go abroad every year on holiday with the family			0
the previous few years i 've been to the @entity45 and @entity46			0
‘ ( they were ) far hotter than @entity13 , which was only @entity48 when i was there			1
the only thing that was different was the sun cream i used			1
it was the first time i had used @entity7			2
’ doctors gave miss @entity8 - who was abroad earlier this month with partner @entity53 , 40 , and children @entity55 , 13 and @entity56 , 19 - four steroid injections and antihistamines over the course of a day			1
she claimed medical staff discharged her after saying she would need to pay for her own treatment because her travel insurance would not cover the treatment an allergic reaction			0
miss @entity8 added : ‘ luckily my condition had already begun to calm down after the injections and i was only left with a doctor 's bill of around € 100			1
it could have been much worse			0
’ after leaving hospital , medical staff gave her strict instructions to avoid sunlight , sugary and fatty foods , and she spent the next week trying to get home earlier than planned			2

i spent the next week in my room trying to get cheap flights , to no avail			0
‘ i also looked up @entity7 on the internet and could n't believe how many people were complaining about allergic reactions			2
i 'm convinced using the cream caused the reaction			2
’ last week , the sun cream featured on the @entity93 's watchdog show after producers were inundated with health complaints about it			1
leading dermatologist dr @entity97 , of @entity98 in @entity99 , said two of the cream 's ingredients could be the reason for the severe reactions he had seen			1

he also claimed that one in 10 of the patients he now sees were allergic to another active ingredient in the @entity115			0
since @entity8 arrived back in @entity118 last saturday , her gp confirmed she suffered an allergic reaction , and further tests were planned to see if @entity7 was behind this reaction			1
a @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ the safety of our products is our first priority			2
‘ all ingredients in our products are reviewed by experts and all our final formulations are assessed for safety and efficacy , including the potential for skin irritation and toxicity caused by sun exposure			0
' in principle nearly every substance or product in our daily life may cause irritation in some people with a particular sensitivity			0
‘ this applies to the ingredients of all cosmetic and personal care products , and includes those ingredients in @entity7 1 day long - @entity111 - 38 @entity110 and @entity147			1
‘ we have received some consumer complaints that @entity7 1 day @entity149 has led to skin irritation or rashes			1
compared to the number of people using the product across the @entity155 and @entity156 , the number of reported incidents is small - approximately 0.01 per cent of sales			0
‘ since the watchdog report was broadcasted we have been contacted by a number of consumers , and we are currently investigating their complaints			2
‘ we have provided ms @entity8 with a questionnaire and requested that she return the product to us so that we can investigate her complaint			2
we have offered her a refund or replacement for the product			0
