@entity0 claimed @entity1 can handle the pressure as he closes in on becoming @entity4 ’s all - time leading goalscorer			1
@entity1 scored from the penalty spot during @entity4 ’s 5 - 0 destruction of @entity8 minnows @entity9 in their @entity11 qualifier at @entity12 , but missed several chances to add to his total of 42 goals			1
sir @entity17 ’s record of 49 , plus @entity19 ’s haul of 48 and @entity20 ( 44 ) are within sight for the @entity23 striker			1
we 'd like to think , with the way he is and the footballer he is , he 's got a good few years in him yet			2
‘ there are plenty of games left			2
i do n't think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early			0
‘ the important thing is he keeps playing well and doing a job for the team and working as hard as he did tonight			0
‘ he got in a lot of times			0
his runs were very good			0
he 's a bit disappointed with the chip			0
he thought that was on			0
@entity51 was effectively a spectator against @entity9 , but fans voted him man of the match anyway @entity55 was the eventual recipient of the award , despite only getting 11 per cent of the vote ‘ i 'm more than happy with him			1
it was another good captain 's performance , solid throughout			0
’ although @entity9 scored a clear own goal from @entity1 ’s deflected effort @entity0 joked that the @entity4 forward should have been given the goal			1
he said : ‘ i ’d always back @entity1 , but i guess we will have to wait for the @entity67 verdict			1
’ @entity68 opened the scoring for @entity4 in the 24th minute and @entity1 scored from the spot before the break			1
@entity73 scored after half - time , @entity72 added another and an own goal gave @entity4 victory in front of just over 60,000 supporters at @entity12			1
@entity4 fans made their views known on the quality of opposition when they voted @entity51 , who did n’t have one save to make , the @entity84 man of the match			2
@entity55 was joined by club team - mate @entity73 who scored his country 's third on thursday night @entity0 said he was pleased with the result against @entity9 , who , he claimed , had improved @entity0 added : ‘ i would n't disagree with @entity55 's award ( as the official man of the match )			1
‘ his passing was outstanding in the second half and he did n't do too badly in the first half either			0
it was nice to see @entity98 again , those wonderful touches			2
‘ we did n't always convert them , but we must have had seven or eight intricate moves in the penalty box but could n't put them away			0
‘ i was pleased we won , pleased we got the job done , very pleased with the crowd who were terrific throughout : their mood , their buoyancy and determination to get some enjoyment from the game			2
‘ that was a cause of satisfaction			0
we kept plugging away in the first half when it was difficult to break them down			0
@entity117 continued his international education against sub-standard opposition like his @entity121 team - mate @entity117 , @entity120 was substituted at half time ‘ our tempo was up in the second half , because it was hard for them to keep going in that second half			2
‘ it 's an important job done and we can concentrate our efforts on the second game , in @entity129			0
‘ we should stop being surprised in international football			0
if you happen to be called @entity132 , @entity133 or @entity4 , we ca n't expect we can go and beat whoever because we have more people than them			1
‘ @entity9 were better this year , though as an amateur team it 'll be a while before they win somewhere like @entity12 , i hope			1
’ @entity0 took off two @entity121 players at half - time - @entity117 and @entity120 - but insists it had nothing to do with his public spat with @entity146			1
the @entity4 head coach added : ‘ with the wealth of talent we have in attacking areas , it was nice today to take people like @entity117 , @entity120 and @entity73 off who might play an important role for us on sunday			2

@entity4 beat @entity9 5 - 0 at @entity12
@entity1 scored , taking his record to 42 , two behind @entity20
