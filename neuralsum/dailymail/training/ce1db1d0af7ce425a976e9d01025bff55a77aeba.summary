the power of the internet has become painfully obvious to a number of @entity4 citizens who have fallen victims to what officials call the ' human flesh search engine ’			1
the phenomenon sees hundreds of thousands of online users target an individual in order to track them down , sometimes in order to right an action the mob deem ‘ wrong ’ or simply because their image has gone viral			1
it has been described as a vigilante movement , but due to the mob mentality , innocent people have found their lives ruined by being falsely accused of actions they did not commit			0
rule of the online mob : the ' human flesh search engine ' involves thousands of online users targeting an individual in order to track them down in real life when an image or an event ' goes viral ' , meaning that it is being shared in large numbers on online social networks within a short space of time , causes are highlighted , news spread instantly and individuals gain momentary fame or end up ‘ named and shamed ’ across the globe			1
in the closed online community of @entity4 , where global communication hubs such as @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 are blocked , these ‘ viral ’ causes tend to stay within the country ’s borders			1
despite official censors , who warned of the phenomenon last month , trying their best to monitor content to delete blog posts and comments that disagree with the hardline communist government , the internet moves too fast even for them			2
as @entity4 has the world 's largest internet population with 591 million users – a number which is expected to increase to more than 750million by 2015 - the ' human flesh search engine ' strikes swift and hard and can ruin a person 's life in an afternoon			1
one recent example is a supposedly innocent taxi driver from the western @entity4 city of @entity72 found himself accused of humiliating a homeless person in the street			1
the ' human flesh search engine ' : @entity4 has the world 's largest internet population with 591 million users ¿ a number which is expected to increase to more than 750million by 2015 when a witness spotted a taxi driver spitting on the elderly man on an @entity72 street , he or she noted the license plate and posted it online urging the ' human flesh search engine ' to track the man down and make him pay			1
the post called for the responsible taxi driver ’s details to be spread all over the internet so he could be ‘ extinguished ’ and forced out of @entity72			2
within hours , the online mob had located taxi driver @entity92			0
however , mr @entity92 claims he is completely innocent			0
‘ all of my private information was made public			0
my id card number , name , phone number , address , even my mother - in - law 's phone number was dug out and posted online , ’ @entity92 told the @entity93			0
‘ i even received phone calls blackmailing me , threatening to burn my house down if i did n't pay them 200,000 rmb ( £ 20,000 )			0
’ another example is that of ' @entity105 ' an innocent high school student whose photograph enjoying a beverage went viral			0
@entity109 was snapped by a friend in 2009 , after which her image spread on @entity4 social networking site @entity114			2
' a newspaper reporter called me one day and suddenly i realised that people had noticed me on the internet , ' @entity109 told @entity93 , explaining that she remains an online celebrity several years later and that stalkers even tried to break into her university campus dorm			2
' no matter where i go , people attempt to take secret photos of me , ' she added .			0
