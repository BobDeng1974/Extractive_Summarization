by @entity0 it was the biggest hair trend of last summer , and it seems pink hair is back on fashion 's radar - but not as you might remember it			1
the rosy hue was huge on catwalks and editorials again for @entity10 but instead of washed out or dip dye , colour was seen only through the mid-lengths - leaving roots and tips untouched			0
@entity16 - based colorist @entity15 pioneered the ' halo ' trend in august on @entity20 singer @entity19 by bleaching a stripe across her brunette hair			1
now , supermodel @entity23 , who is marrying her man @entity24 today , is the latest star to sport a splashlight - but this time it 's a girly shade of pink , and totally noncommittal			1
she 's not likely to be wearing it for her big nuptials			0
@entity31 it looks campaign includes international it girl @entity23 in a key colour trends for this season - the splash of pink she is engaged to be married and loved - up @entity23 , 28 , is now willing to try new things with her hair look for the first time ever			1
@entity23 says : ' for me , it ’s the perfect evolution of the dip dye , which was the big colour story of recent years			1
' this is the first time i 've changed the colour of my hair			2
i 've been blonde all my life and felt this was the moment to try something different			2
' since i was a little girl i always wanted to one day have pink hair , especially after the cartoon character @entity51 and the holograms where the lead character had long , candy floss coloured hair			1
' the @entity55 , credited as one of @entity31 's latest it looks for @entity10 , involves adding a horizontal band of striking colour - a splash of pink for example - through the mid length section			1
@entity16 - based colorist @entity15 pioneered the ' halo ' trend in august on @entity20 singer @entity19 by bleaching a stripe across her brunette hair @entity23 's look was created especially for the brand using their new @entity69			1
it 's inspired by the huge influx of pink on the catwalk in both clothes and make - up at @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
the daring new colour trend is now slowly filtering through to celebrities and fashionistas , soon to be seen on @entity84 everywhere as girls flock to hairdressers requesting this style			2
tell us about the splashlight you created for @entity23 : it ’s a new and original way of adding a flash of colour to long hair , a horizontal band of striking colour that runs through the mid-lengths section			1
this placement is what makes the look so eye catching , because it is unexpected and you intrigued as to how the splashlight was created			0
why was @entity23 chosen to model the pink splashlight it look : because , like @entity23 , the splashlight is fun and fresh			1
the pastel pink also works particularly well on natural blonde base			0
can i try a splashlight if i 'm brunette ? i might choose a colour that was a little deeper and darker			0
perhaps a violet or purple shade to compliment the natural brown base			2
is skin tone important to consider when choosing a splashlight colour ? the most important thing is to start with a base of natural hair colour at the roots and ends because it will tie in with the skin tone			0
you can then be more experimental with your choice of splashlight shade			0
@entity126 is great since it provides a range of bold colour options but the commitment is low since it washes out after a few shampoos			0
the most important thing is to start with a base of natural hair colour at the roots and ends a @entity136 spokesperson said : ' with pink so visible on the catwalk , the trend seemed to escalate as the year went on and @entity55 was a new placement area in the hair ( middle band on @entity23 )			1
' it gives a big impact without as much commitment as an all over colour wash to the vibrant shade alongside the launch of our @entity149			0
' the trend means you could go pink for the weekend and be back to normal on monday for work			0
' @entity23 recently returned from the @entity154 festival , where she celebrated her upcoming nuptials with a series of mini hen dos			1
@entity23 is due to marry fiance @entity24 tomorrow			2
the pair are pictured here at a premiere together tools : for this effect put the @entity31 pink hairchalk into a disposable plastic bowl and use a clean make - up sponge to apply			0
@entity136 's @entity126 comes in a variety of colours for different hair shades you can dye your mid section or simply chalk it for a temporary look , as @entity171 says			2

@entity173 *announce* ' splashlighting ' as biggest summer trend
