by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 12:49 est , 10 december 2013 @entity3 : 14:40 est , 10 december 2013 fungus can be used to make bread and beer , but few people might imagine it could play a key role in creating safer insecticides , medical implants or green fuel			1
but a group of scientists who are fans of mushrooms and their other spore - producing relatives believe we could be entering the ‘ @entity20 ’ - and it could help save the world			2
most of a mushroom ’s power lies beneath the soil in a bundle of filaments called that mycelium that secrete enzymes capable of breaking down soil and rocks			0
they also produce potent chemicals to defend their territory , and release nutrients into the soil			0
he turned them into biofuel , which he has tested in his motorbike and it is this mycelium that is of predominant interest to mycologists , who believe mushrooms could be used to produce superior drugs and green materials of the future , @entity52 's @entity51 reported			0
@entity37 , a microbiologist at @entity38 , @entity39 , has developed a biofuel after discovering that a wood - decaying fungus called @entity42 contains volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels			1
dr @entity37 worked with the ‘ jelly drop ’ mushrooms to turn what he described as ‘ dead leaf matter ’ into biofuel , which he has since tested in his motorbike			1
unlike biofuels made from fermented crops , the fungus - derived fuel could be made from agricultural waste and dr @entity37 is keen to commercialise the idea			2
and @entity74 , ceo of @entity75 , believes he can take the idea a step further - with a car made from fungus			1
@entity80 is a flexible polymer , like plastic , which is biodegradable and can be persuaded to grow into different densities to produce a variety of materials with different properties			0
his company already supplies mushroom packaging to @entity90 computers called @entity91 , which acts as a subsitute for polystyrene , which is not very environmentally friendly			0
ecolative design makes packaging components from fungi to replace fabricated polyethylene foam parts that provide cushioning in large packages			0
a wine case is pictured but the company also makes packing material for @entity90 's computers it uses agricultural by - products like husks and plant stalks from rice , buckwheat and cottonseed combined with mycelium to grow the material			0
@entity112 is now working on making synthetic bone made using mycelium as a scaffold , as well as moulded parts for electric cars and fire - resistant insulating foam			2
the company is creating a sustainable surfboard made from mushrooms and is working with partners to create materials with ' unique performance properties ' to meet specific needs			0
@entity126 , mycologist and adviser to the @entity128 at the @entity130 ’s @entity129 , has 30 mushroom - based patents for environmental and medical devices , with his company @entity133			2
his stand - put idea is ‘ mycorestoration ’ which involves adding groups of specific fungi to soil to clean up contamination and speed up the amount of carbon absorbed to help mitigate climate change			1
he also believes that @entity143 can be used to make ‘ universal insecticide ’			1
@entity74 , ceo of @entity75 , believes fungi fuel could one day power an electric car , composed of parts made of mushrooms			1

a microbiologist at @entity38 has developed a biofuel using a fungus that has volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel
@entity159 mycologist @entity126 thinks @entity143 can be used to make ‘ universal insecticide and mushrooms could combat climate change
@entity74 , ceo of @entity75 , believes fungi fuel could one day power an electric car , composed of parts made of mushrooms
