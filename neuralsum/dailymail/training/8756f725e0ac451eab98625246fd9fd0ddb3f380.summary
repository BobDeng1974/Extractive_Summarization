it 's certainly a novel way to improve the interaction between man and bird			2
a new sport has been launched which gives paragliders the opportunity to interact with vultures as they glide above the land : parahawking			1
invented by avian expert @entity10 to highlight the plight of @entity13 's endangered vultures , the sport combines ancient falconry methods with the modern techniques of paragliding , where both parties use rising currents of warm air to glide high above the land			1
way to go ! the vulture comes in for a tasty morsel mid-air ' @entity23 are able to gain height and fly long distances without flapping their wings , ' explains @entity10			2
' we as paragliders harness their natural ability to conserve energy by following them as we fly			1
' during the flight paragliders place small morsels of meat onto their gloved hands and the birds gently land to take the food , then fly gracefully away to find the next thermal			1
' it 's a perfect symbiotic relationship , ' @entity10 said			2
' @entity40 has gone from a personal experiment to a global phenomenon whereby several hundred people each year are taken on a tandem flight and given the unique opportunity to fly and interact with a bird of prey in its own environment			1
' @entity48 strapped together as they paraglide can take advantage of the thermals used by the birds flying alongside them vultures are often misunderstood and have a rather unsavory image , says @entity10 @entity13 's vultures are virtually on the brink of extinction due to a drug called @entity60 , an anti-inflammatory drug commonly administered to sick and dying livestock across @entity13 which is poisonous to vultures			1
when the birds feed from animal carcasses that have been treated with @entity60 , it causes renal failure and death			2
the @entity69 , @entity70 and the @entity71 have declined 99.9 per cent in the last 15 years , meaning 40 million birds have died			0
' vultures are often misunderstood and have a rather unsavory image , ' says @entity10			0
' by using vultures for @entity40 we hope to change our perceptions of them			0
@entity40 is our unique and innovative contribution to help prevent the potential extinction of this important species			0
' @entity82 is hoping that parahawking will help prevent the potential extinction of the @entity13 vulture ' by interacting and connecting with these majestic @entity23 we intend to raise awareness of the vultures ' plight			1
' if you 're wondering why all the fuss about vultures , they play a vital role by disposing of dead matter that would otherwise pose a risk of disease , explains @entity10			0
due to their decline there there has been a dramatic increase in feral dog numbers , which pose a risk to human health			0
@entity40 is not just a joyride			0
it 's an education in bird of prey behaviour and conservation as a whole			1
@entity40 supports vulture conservation by donating 1000 rupees from every @entity40 tandem experience to selected vulture conservation projects in @entity114			0
the parahawking season , based in @entity116 , @entity114 , runs from around october to april			0
to try your hand at the sport , the price for is around Â£ 225 including two night 's accommodation			1
it seems the sport is gaining in popularity : the @entity124 recently celebrated the sport 's number one ranking as the top activity in @entity116 on @entity129 .			0

paragliders ' fly ' alongside birds of prey thousands of metres above the land
@entity13 vultures are used in the practice to raise awareness of their plight
birds will eat from the paraglider 's hand before soaring off to find thermals
