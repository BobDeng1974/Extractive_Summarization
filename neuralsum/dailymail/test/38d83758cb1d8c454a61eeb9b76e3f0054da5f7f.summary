raising the retirement age is unfair on @entity3 pensioners because they die younger , @entity0 declared yesterday			1
she is pictured at the @entity18 during an election campaign visit in @entity20 the @entity4 leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds at the same time , she issued a demand for a huge inflation - busting increase in the state pension , which would cost billions of pounds more			1

parts of @entity3 have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the @entity33			1

across @entity3 the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women			0
in @entity40 and @entity41 the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women			0
but various studies have linked lower life expectancy in @entity3 to higher rates of alcohol consumption , smoking , and poor diet			2
it is also linked to levels of poverty and housing			0
her comments will raise concerns that the @entity4 will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the @entity33 which will benefit @entity3 most			1
miss @entity0 said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘ at least ’ £ 160 a week			1
it is currently £ 113 speaking on a visit to a care home in @entity63 , @entity60 said : ‘ the @entity67 / @entity66 government ’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the @entity33 who are planning for their future , but the failure to take @entity3 ’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair			1
‘ our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which i will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in @entity3 who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out			2
’ ‘ that is why @entity4 mps will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age			2
’ ‘ our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return			0

’ the @entity4 have demanded an end to ‘ austerity ’ and for the @entity108 nuclear missile system to be scrapped a @entity110 spokesman said : ‘ capping the state pension age in @entity3 will cost hardworking taxpayers across @entity33 more than £ 12.5 billion			1
‘ this gives another glimpse into a future with @entity8 as prime minister , in the @entity4 ’s pocket – meaning more borrowing , more spending , and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay			2
’ on sunday miss @entity0 said the @entity4 would be prepared to prop up a minority @entity124 government even if @entity8 lost the election			2

for many years , the @entity33 state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60			0
but from 2020 , both men and women ’s retirement age will be 66 , increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028 , and then linked to life expectancy after that			2
the government will then review the state pension age every five years			0
during last year ’s referendum campaign , the @entity4 argued the level should only increase to 66 in @entity3 , because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £ 10,000 and £ 11,000 less .			1
