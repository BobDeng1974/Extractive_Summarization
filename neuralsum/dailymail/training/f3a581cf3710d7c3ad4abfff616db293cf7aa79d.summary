it could arguably be the surprise result of @entity2 qualifying			0
international minnows @entity3 are joint bottom of the world rankings with @entity7 and are normally steamrolled by all of their opponents in attempting to qualify for the @entity11 and @entity12			2
but that changed on saturday , when they held @entity15 to a 0 - 0 draw and ended an atrocious run of 61 straight defeats			1
@entity3 players celebrated wildly at full - time after their 0 - 0 draw against @entity15 the result ended @entity3 's 61 - game winless streak by drawing with @entity15 in @entity25 the full - time whistle from referee @entity27 brought mass celebrations from the @entity3 players , who could have been celebrating further if @entity30 's first half header from a corner had drifted into the net rather than past the post			1
they also had @entity34 to thank for keeping @entity36 's effort out and denying @entity37 as the goalkeeper held on to claim @entity3 's third clean sheet ever			2
@entity3 have drawn against @entity40 and @entity41 in @entity11 qualifying , as well as winning 1 - 0 against @entity43 in a friendly ten years ago			1
otherwise , they have lost every game they have played			2
@entity47 scored two late goals as @entity49 eventually claimed a 4 - 0 win over a stubborn @entity52 side in @entity2 qualifying @entity25 @entity52 goalkeeper @entity55 had kept his side in it for over an hour but when his error handed the @entity59 the lead , the floodgates opened			1
@entity61 ( right ) celebrates putting @entity49 2 - 0 up against @entity43 @entity61 added the second and @entity47 's brace made it a comfortable win for @entity49 who move level with their opponents on six points , six behind group leaders @entity70			1
the @entity59 were straight on the front foot and @entity72 brought the first save of the night out of @entity74 after just four minutes with @entity75 making the goalkeeper work again just moments later			0
@entity77 then fired wide and @entity78 saw a header spectacularly saved as the home side bombarded the @entity82 goal in the opening stages			0
@entity84 brought another fine save from @entity74 just before the half - hour and the keeper was keeping his side in it as @entity52 lacked any sort of spark against their well - drilled opponents			2
@entity47 and @entity72 both missed the target in the closing stages of the half and the teams went into the break level despite 45 minutes of @entity59 dominance			0
@entity98 gave @entity59 stopper @entity99 his first work of note to do five minutes after the interval but that was the most respite they would get with @entity77 hitting the post moments later			0
@entity105 ( left ) protects the ball as @entity49 eventually beat @entity43 4 - 0 on saturday @entity47 ( above ) celebrates scoring the third for @entity49 , his first goal of the evening @entity55 had been the hero thus far for the visitors so it seemed almost cruel when his howler handed @entity49 the lead after 66 minutes			1
@entity47 whipped a corner into the near post and @entity113 rose to claim but somehow managed to deflect the ball into his own net as he clashed with @entity117			0
two minutes later it was 2 - 0 and once again it came from a corner			1
the initial set - piece was cleared but when the ball came back in @entity122 was on hand to apply a low finish with the visitors appealing for offside			0
with 10 minutes remaining @entity47 made it 3 - 0 as some good football ended with @entity117 standing up a cross from the byline and the @entity131 man was on hand to head home			1
and in the final minute the pair combined again with @entity72 finding @entity117 and his low cross was finished by @entity47 to complete the scoring			0
@entity70 remain top of the group after their 3 - 1 win over @entity140 at @entity141			2
video @entity47 score a ridiculous overhead kick in training			0

@entity3 hold @entity15 to a 0 - 0 draw to earn a point in @entity25
they had been on a 61 - game losing streak before the *goalless* draw
elsewhere in @entity25 , @entity49 beat @entity43 4 - 0 after @entity70 win
