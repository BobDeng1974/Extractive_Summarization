while most of us schlepped to university on a train , or begged a lift from long suffering parents , for some discerning students , arriving for fresher ’s week is about making a statement			0
in fact some high flying freshers now have the option to travel to their first day on campus using luxurious and bespoke transport options , including a private jet or helicopter , @entity15 and even horse and carriage			2
the new ‘ @entity25 ’ , or ' @entity26 ' , service is the first dedicated to freshers with more money than sense , with a single journey by private jet costing £ 25,000 – as much as an entire degree			1
a trip to university by private jet will set you back about £ 25,000 - as much as an entire degree of tuition fees the @entity32 has a top speed of 217mph , perfect for sitting in those ' back to uni ' traffic jams billed as a way to wow and impress your future lecture companions , it seems like it might be more likely to alienate the ' @entity26 ' from everyone else on campus before fresher 's week has even started			0
run by @entity44 , the service also transports the students ' belongings separately - which is handy given that the trunk space in a @entity32 or @entity49 ( two of the luxury options available ) is rather limited			1
and you can forget living out of your boxes until your mother visits and unpacks for you - the @entity26 service will pack and unpack everything for you			0
why not really set yourself apart by arriving on campus in a £ 10,000 horse and carriage ? assuming your chosen university has a landing pad - helicopter is now a viable mode of transport for £ 20,000 make like @entity64 and roll up in a @entity15 for just £ 15,000 for the one trip @entity66 , co founder of @entity44 commented : ‘ the aspirations of students are continually changing and the need to make that all important first class impression is more paramount than ever			1
' we ’re excited to be answering this demand by launching the @entity74 ’s first luxurious travel service for the students of today			0
‘ the @entity44 service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car			2
' paired with our new @entity26 options , we ’re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach @entity84 with minimum fuss and maximum luxury			0
