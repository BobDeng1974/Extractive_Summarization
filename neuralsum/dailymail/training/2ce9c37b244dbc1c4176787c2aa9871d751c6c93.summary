by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 20 october 2013 a @entity2 building owner has hired security guards and installed a metal gate to protect a work by the elusive @entity7 graffiti artist @entity6			1
the rolling gate went up friday over a wall in the @entity11 neighborhood where @entity6 spray - painted two geishas strolling over a ' bridge ' formed by a basement window arch and a bonsai tree spread beneath them			1
the security measures were taken after a rogue tagger spray - painted over the work and was tackled to the ground by the crowd			1
installation : the owners of the building have installed plexiglass and a roller - door to protect the @entity6 stencil on their wall opening hours : the owners are exercising some crowd control for the hoards who have gathered outside the south @entity11 building to view the @entity6 piece others undertook damage control , removing the offending black scribble with rubbing alcohol			1
@entity40 , whose family owns the building , write in @entity43 that her father sent her a text on thursday morning saying , ' @entity6 painted our building last night and a huge crowd is forming			1
what should we do ? ' it 's not a question to be taken lightly			0
@entity6 canvases sell for upwards of $ 1 million and art - lovers collect his work with feverish zeal			1
just an hour after the work was discoverd , the tagger defaced it and friends and neighbors urged the family to take measures to protect the work			2
@entity40 says that she and her family realized that they had unwittingly become responsible for a piece of public art. secure : the piece has drawn crowds of people since it appeared thursday morning under guard : @entity74 guards the work by @entity7 graffiti artist @entity6 today in the @entity2 borough of @entity77 tagged : the work was up for less than an hour before a tagger , seen here in a purple scarf , spray painted over it			1
two bystanders tried to stop the vandal @entity86 themed : the work uses a brick window archway on the side of a building in @entity11 , @entity2 , to stand in for a bridge thwarted : the building superintendent is seen here throwing the tagger to the ground			1
he called police , but the rival graffiti artist escaped by late thursday morning , word had spread and more than 500 people had gathered to view the stencil			0
the family hired a security guard to stand watch over the artwork , and several more to cover the night shift			0
police and local councilmen were n't interested in helping the family protect their new acquisition , so they took matters into their own hands			0
' we still have nâ€™t 100 per cent decided what to do , ' @entity40 told the @entity113			0
' but we do have the instinct - and are trying - to preserve it for the public so it can be viewed and enjoyed , and not destroyed in any way			0
' although the work is apparently being preserved for the viewing public , new pictures show the family has imposed some opening and closing hours			1
photos posted to an @entity125 account show a sign over the roller door ( which covers a sheet of protective plexiglass ) informing people that the door will come up for viewing at 3pm			2
@entity6 has caused quite a stir in the @entity133 , where he 's undertaking a monthlong ' residency			2
' @entity77 wake every morning to discover a new work adorning some corner of the city			0
defacing street art : the tagger who scrawled over @entity6 's work was tackled to the ground by a crowd who had gathered to see the piece other building owners have also been quick to preserve what could be a big money - spinner , or less cynically , a piece of art for public enjoyment			1
a small stencil of the @entity152 in @entity153 was covered in plexiglass and another @entity6 of a heart - shaped balloon is under guard and welded steel			2
mayor @entity159 said last week that graffiti ruins property and is ' a sign of decay , ' but said the @entity164 is not actively searching for the artful artist			0
in the 19 days since @entity6 came to @entity77 for a so - called residency , fans of his work have had to race against taggers , who are intent on covering it with their own marks			2
some of the taggers see @entity6 as an interloper intruding on their turf , while some see him as a sell - out			0
still others get a thrill out of putting their own mark on work by such a famous artist .			0

@entity6 spray - painted an artwork on the side of a building in @entity11 on *wednesday* night
following a rogue tagger scrawling over the work , the building 's owners have taken measures to protect it
there are now a plexiglass screen , a roller *shutter* and *24* - hours guards protecting the work
most recently , the owners have imposed viewing times on the art - loving public
