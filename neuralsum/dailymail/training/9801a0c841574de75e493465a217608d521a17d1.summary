a @entity1 club has played the unlikely role of matchmaker to help a bashful fan meet the ' unreal looking girl ' seated in front of him			2
the @entity9 supporter , known only as @entity10 , was too shy to speak to the pretty brunette himself so went to the club for help			1
determined to assist the shy supporter , the club placed a red rose on his seat to help break the ice between the pair			1
but the @entity1 outfit replied saying this would not be possible due to data protection laws			0
instead , staff at the south coast side - who sit in fourth place in the league table - hatched a plan			0
@entity9 mascot ' @entity94 ' did his bit for lovestruck @entity10 by leaving a rose and @entity64 voucher on his seat and wishing him good luck ahead of yesterday 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity59			1
and after the game @entity10 tweeted : ' thank you to @entity9			2
she did n't like the @entity64 but loved the flowers ! ' the romantic tale began when the @entity9 fan wrote to the club asking if they could tell him who the girl was who was ' giving him the eyes '			1
he tweeted : ' @entity114 looking girl that sits 4 seats next to me that keeps giving me eyes			0
can you tell me who sits in @entity123 seat 626 ? ' @entity10 gave the girl the flowers and @entity77 during @entity9 's match against @entity59 that they won 2 - 0 @entity128 midfielder @entity127 leaps in the air after scoring the second goal in the match against @entity59 this prompted @entity9 fan @entity133 to step in as he urged @entity10 to man up and simply speak to her			1
@entity133 wrote : ' why do n't you just speak to her next game ? ' the club replied the day after @entity9 's 3 - 0 over @entity139 on december 20 : ' we 're with @entity133			2
@entity141 is the time to tell people how you really feel - maybe you should 've done it yesterday ? ' he appeared to take this advice and intended to speak to her during the @entity54 match on december 28 , but his plans were dashed when his car broke down - meaning his missed the game			0
@entity10 wrote : ' my car broke down on the way , did n't make the game			0
maybe a @entity155 halftime shout out ? ' spurred on with support from @entity9 icon @entity157 , @entity10 gave her the flower and the voucher before taking a selfie of the pair at the stadium			1
