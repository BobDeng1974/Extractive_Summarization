did @entity0 miss a trick not signing @entity2 ? even if only to thwart his rivals , @entity3			1
the former @entity5 midfielder is playing his best - ever football under @entity7			1
with that in mind , @entity8 have @entity5 fan @entity11 of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation			0
is @entity15 a suitable replacement ? let 's see what he had to say			0
seeing somebody you love in the arms of someone else is very tough			0
especially when they 've already promised that you will always be the only one for them			0
unfortunately , when @entity3 signed @entity2 from @entity27 last summer , @entity5 fans felt that horrible feeling at the pit of their stomach			1
our former captain broke his promise and shacked up with that rich , more successful fella who lives down the road			0
@entity38 fans were left searching for the hows and whys of @entity2 ' decision to move to @entity42			0
when it was revealed that @entity0 actually turned the @entity45 down before completion of his @entity3 move , his transfer tactics were once again called into question			1
@entity15 pictured for @entity5 since signing from @entity27 as their newest forward @entity2 joined @entity3 after @entity5 boss @entity0 opted against bringing him to the @entity50 @entity0 's preference to stay true to the super-expensive and at times invisible @entity54 was the justification and it did n't sit well with many , me included			1
one month on , in july , @entity0 raided @entity27 himself to sign his joker in the pack			1
@entity15 arrived for a bumper £ 30million and in his first half season of @entity61 football has already become the new darling of the @entity50			2
having hit 14 goals in all competitions before @entity65 - including nine in the @entity61 - @entity15 looks the perfect fit for @entity68 football			2
his strong work - ethic , appetite for attack and goal return already mean that @entity15 is indispensable to @entity0 's plans			2
if there is a man who can lead the side beyond the realms of fourth - placed normality , it 's the 26 - year - old			0
both players commanded a similar fee , both arrived from @entity27 and both are already proven at the highest level			0
whichever player @entity0 had decided to sign , it would have been a major coup			0
@entity2 celebrates putting @entity3 2 - 0 up against @entity87 at the @entity88 on monday night @entity2 had proved a shrewd move by @entity7 as he has 12 assists this season for @entity3 @entity0 opted to stay true to the super-expensive @entity54 over @entity2 during the summer while @entity2 is having perhaps his best ever season in @entity68 football , we should stay faithful with @entity0 's choice			1
the @entity45 has notched 12 assists in @entity3 blue already this season – one more than @entity99 has made in his entire @entity61 career - and it 's a remarkable statistic			2
@entity102 ' record is even better than the combined total of @entity5 midfielders , including the likes of @entity54 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
but had he been taken ahead of @entity15 , he would have been just one more player to fit into a lineup of midfield clones			0
each of the aforementioned midfielders bear similarity to each other 's style and should @entity0 finally decide to address the actual weaknesses in our squad over the next couple of transfer windows , @entity5 will rightfully stand at the next level			2
@entity15 ( right ) acknowledges @entity123 as the @entity5 forward proves he has fit in well in @entity124 a defensive midfielder and at least two defenders are a necessity and those signings coupled with the flexible @entity15 will give us more options			1
we wo n’t be title contenders until those problems further down the pitch are solved , but @entity0 's decision to sign @entity15 over @entity2 is a sign that he is building for now and the future			1
@entity15 is the younger of the two and has the x factor that we have been lacking since @entity139 departed in 2007			0
while a former favourite son of north @entity124 is flourishing at his new club , @entity15 is on his way to becoming an @entity5 great - and @entity0 actually deserves some credit for it for once			1
@entity0 deserves credit for bringing in @entity15 , even if he did miss out on @entity2 , who joined @entity3 for more @entity5 fan views or to join the conversation visit www.90min.com			1

@entity15 has proved a shrewd *buy* by manager @entity0
@entity2 joined @entity3 after @entity5 opted against going for him
the @entity3 midfielder has been playing the best football of his career
