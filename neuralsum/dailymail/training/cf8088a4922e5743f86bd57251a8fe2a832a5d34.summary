by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 11 february 2013 it cost £ 25million , weighs 1,300 tons and was part of @entity4 's masterplan to double its natural gas production by the summer			1
so when this vast rig plunged below the waves of the @entity9 in just 30 seconds , witnesses could only watch in horror			1
they were , however , the lucky ones			0
colleagues perched on top of the towering metal platform were forced to scramble upwards before diving into the choppy waters in a desperate bid to survive			0
some were still clinging to it as it went down though it is believed no - one suffered serious injury or died			0
it is thought that the water at the spot where the gas rig sank is over 260ft deep			1
@entity4 has called for foreign help in raising the platform , a rare request by an industry isolated by international sanctions			1
@entity46 , managing director of the @entity47 , said assessments indicated the jacket had not been seriously damaged and could be recovered			1
an official with @entity51 , @entity52 , earlier told @entity4 news agency @entity53 that crisis groups had been set up on the site and in @entity56 and that steps to recover the giant structure could begin when the weather and sea conditions improved			2
however , an inside source said both the @entity47 and state - run service company @entity63 have reached out for international help to get it done			2
' without the help of foreign companies ... it is forecast that it wo n't be possible to retrieve the jacket for several months , ’ an unidentified @entity47 official told @entity53 the @entity47 official said that calls for help had been sent out to several international companies that might have the specialized equipment needed , without having received any response by wednesday afternoon			2
@entity77 - let us off : the event was filmed from a nearby rescue vessel ready to pick up the men still left on the gas rig fight or flight : a few workers have already jumped into the sea , but some still hold on to the sinking rig until the last minute gone in 30 seconds : it takes less than half a minute for the gas rig to disappear completely under the surface the equipment is one of four planned for phase 13 of @entity4 's @entity33 gas field project , which covers an area of 9,700 square kilometres which is estimated to contain some 14 trillion cubic meters of gas			1
however the scheme has been hampered by the trade sanctions imposed on the country by the @entity99 last year , leading to a withdrawal of international energy companies ’ support and difficulties in acquiring technology			0
the @entity33 gas field holds eight per cent of total gas reserves of the world and half of the country 's proven gas reserves as well as is the host of the most important industrial complexes of the country and the most important part of oil industry 's value chain			0
tight banking restrictions , which @entity119 governments have imposed to pressure @entity56 to stop its disputed nuclear program , have made it difficult for companies to get paid for supplying goods and services to @entity4			2
the sanctions - battered energy industry has pushed on without them			0
most of the parts are now manufactured inside @entity4 , @entity4 industry officials say , but the need to develop in - house equipment has slowed projects .			0

gas rig sinks in the @entity9 off the coast of @entity4 in less than a minute
over a dozen workers are still on the rig as it goes down
no deaths or injuries were reported by owners @entity47
