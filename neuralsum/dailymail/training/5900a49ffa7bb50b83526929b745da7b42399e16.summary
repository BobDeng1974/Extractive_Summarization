police will have to destroy mugshots of innocent people following a landmark case brought by a 15 - year - old			1
the boy went to court after being told his image would be held until he reached 100 – even though no charges were laid against him			2
the @entity9 ruled yesterday that retaining photographs of suspects who have never been charged was a breach of their human rights			1
landmark ruling : @entity15 ( left ) and justice @entity16 ( right ) have told the @entity17 it is acting unlawfully by holding photographs of suspects later cleared of any wrongdoing police forces will now have to trawl through their records deleting images , including those of people cleared at trial			1
the teenager from @entity27 , @entity28 , was arrested on suspicion of rape in april 2009 but no charges were brought when a witness failed to confirm an offence took place			0
when he asked to have his details removed he was told the mugshot could be retained until he reached the age of 100			2
he was 12 at the time			0
blow : police argued the powers to keep suspect 's pictures on file was vital in the fights against crime			1
( @entity45 picture ) human rights : the latest @entity9 judgement means police can not hold photos , fingerprints and dna of people who have not committed a crime the second claimant was a cyclist from @entity56 accused of assaulting a police community support officer who stopped her riding on a footpath in april 2007			1
police have faced a series of allegations , over recent years , of creating a @entity64 society after obtaining and keeping innocent citizen 's private information			1
the @entity17 were accused of a ‘ back - door surveillance scheme ’ after it emerged there were harvesting millions of pieces of mobile phone data from people who have never been convicted of any crime			1
officers could also access and copy website histories and email content from smart phones , including records of activity on @entity79 and other social networking sites			0
the data , will be stored indefinitely , even if the suspect is either released without charge or , when prosecuted , cleared by the courts , police said			1
under the £ 50,000 scheme , some 16 terminals designed to harvest the mobile phone data , have been placed in police stations across @entity28 and 300 officers trained to use them			2
in 2008 , the @entity93 order police to delete the dna and fingerprints held on a national database from suspects later cleared of wrongdoing			1
the damning verdict , the 17 - strong panel said keeping the records ' could not be regarded as necessary in a democracy '			0
before 2001 , the police had to destroy dna samples of individuals acquitted or not charged			1
but a rule change has allowed them to keep profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
the details of about 4.5million people are held on the database yet one in five - including 40,000 children - had never been charged with an offence			0
at the time the @entity119 said the register has proved a key intelligence tool in solving 3,500 cases - including high - profile rapes and murders			0
the 60 - year - old , who was described as of good character , had dna samples , fingerprints and photographs taken but the @entity130 decided not to charge her with any offence			1
when she complained , the @entity17 refused to delete her record			2
the force ’s policy , which is based on the home secretary ’s code of practice , is to retain mugshots for a minimum of six years , although this can be extended indefinitely			0
@entity141 argued that it was necessary to keep the photographs to prevent crime and disorder			2
but @entity15 said the policy drew ‘ no adequate distinction ’ between those who are convicted and those who are either acquitted or not even charged			0
the judge , sitting with mr justice @entity16 , concluded : ‘ i am not satisfied that the existing policy strikes a fair balance between the competing public and private interests and meets the requirements of proportionality			0
‘ in my judgment , therefore , the retention of the claimants ’ photographs in application of the existing policy amounts to unjustified interference with their right to respect for their private life and is in breach of @entity166			0
’ the judge granted the force a few months to revise their policy			0
home secretary @entity171 now has two weeks to lodge an appeal on the ruling , which has implications for all police forces			0
the courts have already ruled that it is unlawful to keep innocent people ’s fingerprints and dna indefinitely			1
but @entity15 said the @entity17 would not have to delete details of the teenage boy ’s alleged offence from the police national computer			1
yesterday @entity185 , general counsel for @entity186 , which backed the test case , said : ‘ there is no good reason why the police should hold on to information about people who have not committed any crime			2
’ a @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ we are urgently examining the implications of today ’s ruling			0

@entity200 's most *senior* judges rule it ' unlawful ' for police to hold onto the data of innocent citizens
police will have to destroy photographs of suspects later cleared of wrongdoing
civil rights *campaigners* *trumpet* judgement a major victory against creation of @entity64 society
judges reject @entity17 's argument keeping images was vital in fight against crime
police had *previously* been told by court keeping dna and fingerprints was unlawful
