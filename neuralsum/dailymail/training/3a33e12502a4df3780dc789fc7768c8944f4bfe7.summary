the 12 - week - old is currently fighting for survival at the @entity20 in @entity21 while mother @entity22 keeps watch by her bedside			2
waiting : @entity22 with her desperately ill daughter @entity25			1
she hopes every day for a call to say an organ has been found she is being kept alive with the help of a life - support machine , which carries out the functions that her heart should			1
if a donor is not found soon , medics at the @entity34 fear she will die.sharon and father @entity36 , are living in hope that they will receive the call from anywhere across the continent to inform them that a donor has been found			1
full - time mother @entity22 , 38 , said : ' we all feel totally helpless			2
i am here every day and there is nothing i can do to help her and it is worst feeling in the world			0
' every day we are hoping and praying we will get the phone call we want to let us know that a heart has been found for her			1
this is the only thing that is going to help her now			0
' it is really hard for all of us , especially @entity36 , as he has had to return to work , but we are all just trying to stay positive for her			0
' @entity7 was diagnosed with a condition which has caused her heart muscle to thicken and prevent it pumping blood around the body mr @entity64 , 52 , an electrician , is working away , but phones the hospital every day to check on his daughter ’s progress			1
doctors first discovered something was wrong when @entity22 attended for her 34 - week pregnancy scan			0
when @entity25 was born at @entity21 ’s @entity72 , she was transferred straight to the @entity34 , where she was monitored for two weeks before being allowed home			1
mother - of - three @entity22 , of @entity76 , @entity77 , also has five - year - old son , @entity79 , and 19 - year - old daughter @entity80			2
she added : ' because the condition is so rare in babies , no one quite knew what was going to happen			1
' but when she was born , she did the opposite of everything doctors thought would happen			0
' she was eventually allowed home and she was doing really well			0
' but then she was brought back to the hospital a few times , as she was not gaining weight or feeding properly , then things started to get worse			0
' i was having to wake her up for feeds and she was sleeping more and more , and she was n’t looking a healthy colour			0
' for the past month , @entity25 has been wired up to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( @entity96 ) machine to provide cardiac and respiratory support			2
@entity22 said : ' this time when i brought her in , they decided to keep her in and she underwent an operation to remove some of the muscle from around the heart , but her heart went into failure , and she has been on life support ever since			2
' it will be four weeks today she was placed on the machine , and all we can do is sit and wait , and pray a donor will be found in time			2
' dr @entity111 , a consultant paediatric cardiologist and transplant physician at @entity21 ’s @entity20 , said : ' this is a condition that is very rare in babies			2
' it is so rare , i have only come across a case of this severity once before in my life			2
' @entity25 is being kept alive by an @entity96 machine , which has taken over the function of her heart			1
all we can do now is wait for a donor to come forward			0
' but if we do not get one in time , she will not make it			0
' @entity25 is at the top of the @entity10 transplant list dr @entity111 told how the hospital receives two to three offers of a heart per year and has sent out the alert across the continent in the bid to save @entity25 ’s life			1
he added : ' we know when a child dies , it is extremely difficult for parents , and it is even more difficult to ask a parent to then donate their children ’s organise			0
' but cases like @entity25 show how vital it is for families to seriously consider organ donation and for people to sign up to the donor register			1
' @entity22 has made a plea for families to sign up to the donor register and help save a life			1
she said : ' i will be honest , until we have found ourselves in this position , i had n’t thought too much about organ donation			0
' it is such a hard thing to think about for a parent when your child has died , but now we are on the receiving end , we see how important this is			0
' it is a really hard situation for us to be in , as we are so desperate for a heart to be found for @entity25 - but we know for a heart to be found , a baby has died			1
' dr @entity111 echoed her message saying : ' i would encourage everyone to speak to their families about organ donation , so that everyone knows their wishes			0
