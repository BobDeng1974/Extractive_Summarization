by @entity1 reporter for years it had remained shut off from the rest of world and shrouded in mystery			0
but this unique collection of images taken 100 years ago are some of the first ever insights in to rural @entity9 before it was opened up to the rest of the globe			2
the collection of pictures - the first ever used to promote tourism in the country - show geishas relaxing in pleasure gardens while workers pick tea leaves from the fields			1
@entity22 : geishas enjoy a summer 's day in a landscaped garden in this 100 - year - old photo by @entity26 unique insight : the rare collection of images show @entity9 just before its industrial revolution the world 's secret garden : the collection of 100 - year - old photos were taken to try to attract tourists to the country at the beginning of the 20th century after the lifting of the bamboo curtain mysterious : @entity9 remained cut off from much of the world until the @entity41 in 1854 iconic landmarks such as the @entity43 , built in 1673 , and the @entity44 of @entity45 , first constructed in 1252 , appear much the same at the beginning of the @entity47 as they do today			1
but while the monuments themselves may look unchanged , the surroundings are now packed with tourists and often surrounded by skyscrapers to house the ever - growing population which has more than doubled from 49,852,000 in 1910 to 128,056,026 in 2010			0
the photos were taken by @entity26 to try to attract tourists to @entity9 after the country opened up to the rest of the world following the convention of @entity60 in 1854			1
the convention opened the @entity9 ports of @entity63 and @entity64 to @entity66 trade for the first time in 200 years and ensured the safety of shipwrecked @entity66 sailors			1
but before the convention , @entity9 had cut itself off from the rest of the world for more than two centuries and was lagging behind in new technologies			1
landmarks : the @entity73 , the main residence of the @entity74 , was completely isolated 100 years ago the past and the present : the @entity73 is now surrounded by modern skyscrapers in @entity77 a bygone era : a lone fisherman is captured coming in to shore water under the bridge : the @entity43 , built in 1673 , still stands today spot the difference : today the @entity43 is lit up at night and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in @entity9 it was only when commodore @entity87 of the @entity88 steamed into the bay in @entity90 with four warships - the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95 - in 1853 that the channels of communication were forced open			2
this eventually lead to the @entity41 agreement the following year			0
@entity9 soon undertook drastic political , economic , and cultural transformations to emerge as a unified and centralised state to try to put itself on an even keel with the @entity104			2
it 's industrial revolution began around 1870 as national leaders hoped to catch up with the @entity104 by building railway lines , better roads , and invested heavily in modern industry such as textiles , including cotton and silk			0
by 1910 , @entity9 had come out triumphant in a war with @entity115 and become the first eastern modern imperial power			1
it was around this time that this collection of photos were taken to show off @entity9 to the outside world , which had previously been rigidly introverted and anti any foreign or outside influence			2
photographer @entity26 was the first to produce tourist shots for @entity9 with an album of 51 collotype black and white photographic prints , which were painstakingly inked in by a team of 100 colourists , and gave @entity126 one of its first glimpses of life inside the previously secretive state			1
out at sea : a few fishing smacks are seen off the @entity9 coast which later became an international port rural village : the black and white images taken by @entity26 were painstakingly inked in by a team of 100 colourists country retreat : the @entity9 are still renowned for their beautiful gardens 100 years on these photos show @entity9 at a prosperous time , when it was starting to build itself into a dominating world power during a period of rapid economic growth and on the cusp of significant technological advancement			1
but as @entity9 began to catch up with the rest of the world powers , it began to exert its brutal power by declaring war on surrounding countries such as @entity154			1
this provoked condemnation from the @entity104 and tensions with @entity66 began to further escalate over its control of @entity9 's oil resources , eventually leading to @entity9 's attack on @entity161 and entry in to @entity163 but these hand - coloured prints show untouched @entity9 before its disastrous losses in @entity163 forced the country to surrender			1
they are mounted in an oblong folio within its original box and are expected to fetch Â£ 800 at auction through @entity172 and @entity173 auctioneers of @entity174 , @entity175			0
@entity176 , @entity177 art expert at @entity178 and @entity173 , said : ' @entity9 had been closed off until the 1860s so it was still relatively new to @entity126			2
' the photos were taken at a time when everything @entity9 was of great interest to people in @entity126 and at a time when photography was in its infancy			0
' they offer a fascinating look at the geisha culture at this time			0
it is a really interesting historical snapshot of @entity9 and its cities 100 years ago			0
' it has come to us from a person in the south west who has had the album for a while now			0
classic @entity9 temple : a @entity200 shrine set alone in the mountains @entity202 : @entity203 looks much the same 100 years ago as it does today braving the rapids : ladies travelling along a dangerous mountain river in a wooden boat tourism spot : locals appear to be climbing over the @entity44 of @entity45 , first built in 1252 iconic : @entity45 is approximately 13.35 metres tall , weighs 93 tonnes , and is today one of the most visited landmarks in @entity9 ' this would appeal to anybody who has an interest in @entity9 culture but it is also a really nice album to dip in and out of for anybody interested in photography or art. ' the geisha is emblematic of what @entity9 culture was at that time and the photographer was a specialist at capturing it			1
' @entity9 had been closed off and there was a huge interest in the country at that time and it was almost like the country was being discovered all over again			0
' the photo album will go to auction at @entity174 on november 15			0
authentic : @entity9 theatre was promoted to try and attract tourists back in time : a rural village street is completely untouched by machinery division of the classes : a peasant woman entertains a child with a handmade toy , left , and @entity239 look at their reflections in a landscaped garden pond , right working hard : women picking tea leaves in long dresses with garments protecting their faces from the sun lasting tradition : @entity9 woman wear traditional outfits - similar to those worn 100 years ago - to pick tea leaves today			0

pictures taken by @entity26 in 1910 were the first ever to be used to promote tourism in @entity9
