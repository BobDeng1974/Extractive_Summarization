the twin birth rate rose by more than two percent a year , on average , from 1980 through 2004			1
it leveled off to less than one percent annually although the rise from 2008 to 2009 was nearly two percent			0
in 2009 , twin rates increased in all 50 states , though the jumps were highest in lower @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0

twinning rates rose by at least 50 percent in the vast majority of states and the @entity96			0
twin birth rates rose by nearly 100 percent among women aged 35 â€“ 39 and more than 200 percent among women aged 40 and over			2
the older age of women at childbirth in 2009 compared with 1980 accounts for one - third of the rise in twinning over the 30 years			1
over the last three decades , rates rose for white , black and @entity108 women , but the increases were not uniform			2

older mums : this bar chart shows how more and more women are having children over the age of 30 while a lot of attention is focused on the impact of fertility treatments , that 's not the only factor			0
before fertility treatments existed , about 2.5 percent of the babies born to women in their late 30s were twins , compared to under two percent for younger and older women			1
some research has suggested women in that age group are more likely to produce multiple eggs in a cycle , increasing their chances of twins			0
