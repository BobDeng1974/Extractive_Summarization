@entity0 wasted no time in booking his place in the last 32 of the @entity2 as the world no 1 dropped just five games against @entity5			1
@entity0 was imperious as he beat world no 88 @entity5 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 in just one hour and 24 minutes to seal a third - round clash with @entity8 or @entity9			1
the four - time @entity11 champion has lost just two sets in his first and second round matches here since 2007 and feels that a combination of factors make this tournament the best of the four majors for him			1
i think there is not one reason , [ more ] a few reasons together			2
' probably the fact that i enjoy the conditions of play			2
even though the last two years the courts have played faster , significantly faster than they were before , still i do enjoy being here in @entity41			0
some nice , positive , easy - going , sport - oriented energy going around			2
people appreciate the sport and make you feel good			0
' of course , it 's the beginning of the year			0
it 's the first big tournament			0
everybody comes fresh and motivated			0
i guess in this kind of package it 's a combination of things that make me feel comfortable on the court here			0
' immediately from the off , @entity0 did not look as if he would drop a set on thursday as he raced to a one - set lead without losing a game in just 21 minutes , making just two unforced errors			1
@entity5 , 23 , finally got on the board in the 10th game of the match but that was the @entity64 's only success in the second set as @entity0 served up his seventh ace to ease to a two - set lead			1
other than a brief rally in the third set , @entity5 had no answer to the world no 1 's devastating display @entity22 ( left ) poses with @entity74 football legend @entity73 by the courts in @entity41 the @entity77 crowd gave @entity5 a cheer as he surprisingly broke for a 2 - 0 lead in the third set after a @entity0 double fault but it did n't last long as @entity0 immediately broke back and went on to secure progression			1
@entity0 said : ' the first two sets definitely have been great			1
overall i executed the game plan			0
everything i intended to do , almost 100 per cent , from every second in my game , serve , baseline play , aggressive shots and aggressive returns			0
' he dropped his first - serve percentage a lot in the second set and obviously allowed me to have a lot of looks at the second serves			2
that , as well , gave me an opportunity to step in and just swing through the ball			0
' @entity0 , 27 , is bidding to become only the second man to win the @entity2 five times , with @entity41 @entity105 still holding the record after winning the title six times in the 1960s .			1

@entity0 was in imperious form as he *cruised* through in @entity11
the @entity28 beat @entity5 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 to reach the third round
other than a brief rally in third set , @entity5 endured a torrid time
@entity0 is bidding to become the second man to win the title five times
