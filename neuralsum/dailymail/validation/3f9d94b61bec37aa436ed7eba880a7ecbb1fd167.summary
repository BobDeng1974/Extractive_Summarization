@entity0 slumped to an embarrassing 4 - 0 defeat at home to @entity3 in front of their biggest crowd of the season as disgruntled supporters tried to storm the home dugout			1
head coach @entity10 insists he will not walk away after the result which leaves the @entity0 one place above the relegation zone			1
but it was an alarming performance which has raised serious questions over his future and that of @entity0 ’s top - flight status			2
@entity18 was at the @entity19 to witness their sorry display and brings you the merit marks which lay bare their shortcomings … @entity10 ca n't bear to watch as his @entity0 side are dismantled by @entity3 at the @entity19 @entity25 4 – left exposed for three of the goals but was outwitted by @entity27 for crucial second which changed mood inside stadium			1
@entity31 3.5 – looked a class act when he first signed , now looks like a 35 - year - old veteran struggling with pace of @entity36			0
@entity25 was at fault for the crucial second goal , which changed the mood in the ground @entity31 , who looked off the pace throughout , is dominated in the air by @entity43 @entity44 3 – the usually - dependable skipper was shambolic and will be wishing @entity47 @entity46 had not been in the stands			0
@entity49 3 – another who is looking like age is catching up with him and was helpless to prevent @entity3 from running riot in the first half			2
@entity55 ( left ) looks defeated as @entity43 celebrates @entity3 's fourth goal before the interval @entity49 is shrugged off the ball all too easily by @entity27 as he began to look his age @entity60 3 – afforded little help by those around him but @entity3 soon realised the weakness in @entity0 ’s side and attacked at will down the left , where @entity60 had no answer			1
@entity68 4 – @entity69 ran all over him and the holding midfielder offered little resistance to wave after wave of @entity3 offensives			2
@entity74 3 – no surprise to see him hooked at the break after a typically ineffective first half			0
reports that an £ 8m deal is already agreed for the @entity81 loanee must be a worry for @entity0 supporters			2
@entity84 4.5 – he ran about and gave his all but was involved in the bizarre incident at start of the second half where he failed to appear until the 49th minute			0
it was in keeping with the home side ’s disastrous afternoon			0
the @entity0 defence can only stop and stare as @entity27 scores his second goal to make it 3 - 0 @entity74 is set to join the club for £ 8.5million from @entity81 - he was ineffective again in the first half @entity97 5 – it was arguably his best display in red and white , but there has n’t been much to choose from			1
he at least got on the ball , although did little with it			0
@entity103 3 – asked to man the left - hand side of midfield , it was a tactic which backfired spectacularly as @entity3 right - back @entity107 had a hand in three of the goals			1
@entity110 3 – was anonymous and failed to pounce on the one decent cross flashed through the goalmouth by @entity103			0
@entity110 was anonymous up front and missed the few opportunities that did come his way subs @entity117 ( on 46 ) 5 – the second half was nothing more than a training - ground exercise and , like the rest of them , @entity117 went through the motions			2
manager @entity10 2 – started with just one up front against lowly @entity3 and stationed striker @entity103 on the left - wing			1
it was a negative set - up and produced a negative performance			0
he insists the players are still on board with his message , but the evidence on the pitch suggests otherwise			0
@entity0 fans show their anger at the club 's manager after @entity10 's side were thrashed at home @entity10 set up for the game in a negative way , and his team were punished by a clinical @entity3 side			1

@entity0 lost 4 - 0 to @entity3 , *conceding* four first half goals
@entity10 *attracted* the ire of the home fans , but refuses to resign
both centre backs were awful , but manager must be held *responsible*
