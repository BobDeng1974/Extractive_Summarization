a damning picture of the vast bureaucracy at the corporation was painted by @entity9 and @entity10			1
mr @entity9 fails to hide his contempt for his bosses in the ‘ over-managed ’ news department , calling them ‘ these bloody people ’			1
criticism : the @entity2 is bloated with more managers than @entity4 who waste all day talking and are obsessed by their pensions , the @entity1 heard @entity9 says his superiors @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , all ‘ belong to a different culture ’ and suggested they were more interested in their pensions than in journalism			1
the two senior figures talked candidly to the @entity26 inquiry team , although their most damning remarks have been censored			0
nonetheless , in the comments that escaped the censor ’s black pen , @entity9 said that after the @entity33 inquiry , editorial decision making at the @entity2 became more ‘ centralised ’ and told @entity26 : ‘ there is a raft of appointments now that have been made of people who are clearly not the most creative			1
‘ they seemed to spend an awful lot of time having meetings with one another ... they do a lot of talking to each other			0
’ @entity9 was scathing of the ‘ editorial policy department ’ , saying : ‘ i do n’t know what they do			1
i mean , they talk to each other , i suppose , as all these bloody people do			2
’ speaking out : a damning picture of the vast bureaucracy at the corporation was painted by @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right and of the department ’s boss , @entity53 , he said : ‘ it would be rather interesting to ask him what his job is			1
i expect you would get a long answer			0
’ in another side - swipe , the veteran broadcaster suggested the managers were ‘ preoccupied by their pensions ’			2
meanwhile @entity10 even half - joked that some of the @entity2 ’s top brass had never even met one another			0
he said : ‘ i went to speak to the senior leader ’s group in the @entity2 and said they had more senior leaders than @entity4			0
‘ the management team , the senior management team , that the previous director general had was 27 - 25 or 27			0
’ he added : ‘ there are the sort of employment opportunities at the @entity2 which simply do n’t exist anywhere else , and i think that is one reason why people get into the @entity2 and then never leave			2

@entity9 and @entity10 were most critical
@entity9 called his bosses ‘ these bloody people ’
he suggested they were more interested in their pensions than journalism
