by @entity0 jetlag could soon be a thing of the past thanks to the development of a new ‘ light shower ’			1
the @entity7 airline @entity6 has unveiled a ‘ photon shower ’ that could help passengers recover from jetlag by using light to alter the body ’s internal clock			1
the ‘ shower ’ allows travellers to input their flight information and it then adjusts to meet their individual needs			2
@entity6 has unveiled a ' photon shower ' that could help passengers recover from jetlag by using light to alter the body 's internal clock it is a light chamber that was designed by @entity6 ’s advertising agency , @entity23 @entity22 , and is the result of neuroscience and sleep research by dr @entity27 , from the @entity28			1
the idea came about after dr @entity27 gave a talk about how light can be used to realign our body clocks when we are jetlagged			2
‘ he casually suggested that people might someday ' bathe in light ' in a kind of ' photon shower ' in order to help their jet - lagged brains recover			1
even celebrities are interested in the ' light shower ' : @entity42 , who plays @entity43 in tv series @entity44 , tried it out at the @entity47 ' this lit up our imaginations immediately , ’ said @entity23 representative , @entity51			2
the breakthrough could mean an end to jetlag for frequent travellers ‘ we started sketching some designs of what that might be like			0
we pitched it to our client , got the green light , brought @entity65 production company @entity63 on board , and started making the photon shower a reality , ’ she added			1
the ‘ shower ’ , which was exhibited at the @entity73 in @entity74 last week , works by creating a light sequence that recreates the effect of sunlight			1
in this way it alleviates jetlag and provides a pick - me - up for tired travellers			0
building a photon shower , the first of its kind , was a complex undertaking , the team said			1
‘ not only was there the build of the physical structure , there was the app to run the device , there was animation that had to be created to project the blue light in an elegant way , there was an algorithm that had to be developed to create custom jet - lag therapy calendars that users could take home , all the way down to a very specific sound design , ’ explains @entity23 employee @entity85			2
he added : ‘ our partners at @entity104 created synesthetic ambient audio derived from the exact light wavelength used in the installation itself			2
it was a delightfully multimedia process			0
‘ when you step inside , the small structure of the shower disappears , and the environment becomes surprisingly expansive			0
‘ using an infinity mirror setup , we made the space feel much larger than it actually is			0
’ when someone enters the ‘ shower ’ they are asked to input their flight information and they are then guided through the experience by a narrator			0
the ' light shower ' ( pictured from the outside ) works by creating a light sequence that recreates the effect of sunlight ms @entity51 said : ‘ flowing blue animations appear before you on the led wall			1
' they ’re particularly impactful because these led panels are typically used for large on - stage displays , so being right up close to a screen like this is really rare			0
' it has a strong effect			0
‘ at times , it really feels like it ’s raining light			0
’ it is believed that the light box could eventually find its way into the home as it could give a pick - me - up to tired partiers or to people who work night shifts			0
@entity6 might eventually offer the ‘ shower ’ to passengers as a way of improving the flying experience .			1

@entity7 airline @entity6 has created ' photon shower ' that could treat jetlag
it uses light to reset the body 's clock by recreating the effect of sunlight
