earlier this week @entity1 confectionery giant @entity0 declared legal war on its @entity4 counterpart for allegedly making their goods too similar to those favoured by @entity9 consumers			1
if successful , the bid would strip @entity4 specialist stores such as @entity12 and @entity13 , in @entity15 's @entity14 , of one of their key selling points			0
it comes years after rumours swirled of an attempted takeover of the @entity4 go - to brand @entity22 by @entity0 's owner @entity23			2
@entity9 favourite : @entity1 confectioners @entity0 's have launched a legal bid to remove @entity22 's products best of @entity4 : fans of the @entity29 in @entity9 complained , saying they preferred the @entity30 treat to home - grown alternatives the two companies quietly reached a deal in 1988 allowing the production of @entity29 and other @entity4 treats with slight tweaks to recipes and packaging			1
in recent weeks @entity4 consumers have also protested at alleged plans of @entity22 's @entity1 owners to change the @entity44 recipe			2
@entity45 changed the recipe for the sweet fondant - filled snack so that the shell is made from a ' standard , traditional @entity22 milk chocolate ' instead of the popular @entity29			0
critics also complained over plans to remove one of the eggs from the standard pack of six			0
but while @entity0 's claims allege harmful similarities between the two , subtle discrepancies between the two recipes mean the @entity9 and @entity4 chocolates are in fact markedly different			2
with @entity4 standards requiring products to contain at least 20 per cent cocoa solids to be categorised as chocolate , its regarded as more delicious across the world			1
@entity1 : 10 per cent cocoa solids @entity4 : 20 per cent cocoa solids @entity1 : @entity9 beans @entity4 : @entity72 beans @entity1 : some goods contain the additive @entity74 used as cheaper cocoa butter alternative generally , ingredients found in @entity9 chocolate bars are cheaper than those in @entity4 counterparts			1
indeed when news of @entity0 's legal threat broke , @entity1 natives were quick to jump to the defence of @entity84 and @entity85			0
' i 'm a proud @entity9 but i hate @entity0 's and have loved @entity22 's since i was a kid , ' one @entity88 user said , while another described the home - grown alternative as ' pure garbage '			1
many chalk the more bitter taste of @entity0 's down to food industry rules which mean only 10 per cent of its famous kisses need to be of pure cocoa solids for it to be considered chocolate			1
while only 11 per cent of @entity0 's bars is made of cocoa , it makes up almost a quarter of a bar of @entity29			0
another reason for varying tastes is the source of each 's beans			0
most companies keep their recipes closely under wraps , though it 's understood @entity9 confectioners prefer @entity9 beans while the @entity4 tend to opt for those grown in @entity72			0
a fundamental difference in taste stems from where cocoa beans are sourced , with @entity4 brands opting for @entity72 produce while @entity1 companies pluck from the fields of @entity9			2

@entity4 standards require that at least a fifth of sweet is cocoa solids
in @entity9 however , only 10 per cent of ingredient is needed in treats
*geographical* differences in cocoa beans contributes to taste differences
it comes as @entity0 's tried to drive @entity22 's goods out of @entity15
