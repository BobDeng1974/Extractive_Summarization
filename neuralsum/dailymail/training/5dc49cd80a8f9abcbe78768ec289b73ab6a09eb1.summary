@entity4 striker @entity1 goes down in the penalty box after @entity16 's challenge it is understood the @entity21 's compliance officer , @entity20 , will not be taking any retrospective action against the @entity24 player after viewing footage of the incident			1
and ahead of the @entity29 game against @entity30 on wednesday night , the @entity4 boss contributed his thoughts to the debate			2
' maybe it was not a penalty but it is a long way from there to diving , ' he said			1
' it looked like he slipped a bit so it is nothing , it is a decision the referee has made			2
' of course i understand the discussion but he did n't do anything wrong			2
' asked if @entity1 should have told @entity10 there had been no contact , the @entity44 replied : ' no , as a player you do n't know everything that is happening			1
' when you play you play to win and you are so focused on winning			2
@entity1 scores from the penalty spot to put @entity4 2 - 0 ahead against @entity8 ' we do n't want cheats , that 's an important thing but i do n't think he was wanting a penalty			1
' things happen in the game and over a long season it will even out , that 's how it is going to be			2
' but this situation is n't the reason why we won this game , we had a lot of chances and we deserved to win			2
' @entity0 also reiterated his backing of @entity65 , whose appeal against his seven - game ban for racially abusing @entity68 defender @entity69 will be on thursday			1
the on - loan @entity71 winger was found guilty by a @entity21 judicial panel , on the balance of probability , of ' excessive misconduct by the use of offensive , insulting and abusive language of a racist nature ' during a @entity29 clash between the two teams in september			1
' we have to do everything in our power to get this away from @entity65 , ' said the former @entity87 boss			0
' we do n't believe @entity65 is a racist			0
' it is word against word and you ca n't take it seriously when it is word against word			0
@entity4 are keen to make @entity1 's move to @entity4 a permanent one after scoring 11 goals ' it should be real proof			1
' if there is no more proof than word against word then we have to do everything we can to help @entity65			0
' this is a real serious accusation , very serious , and you have to absolutely know that you are right			0
' so i hope he does n't get judged on word against word			0
' @entity106 insists the @entity4 squad will stand by the @entity108 regardless of the appeal decision			0

' following their win at @entity9 , @entity4 were drawn away to @entity116 in the last 16 of the @entity7 , a tie described by @entity0 as ' a tough game '			1
however , the @entity120 boss has plenty of games before the trip to @entity124 in february , starting with the visit of @entity30 where a victory will take @entity4 three points clear of @entity128 at the top of the table			0
he said : ' we have the opportunity to go three points ahead and put pressure on the others			0
