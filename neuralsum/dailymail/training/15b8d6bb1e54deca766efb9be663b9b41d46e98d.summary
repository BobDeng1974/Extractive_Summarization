senator @entity0 has sent a letter to @entity3 ’s chief executive highlighting ‘ substantial ’ security concerns about fingerprint recognition technology on its @entity6			1
the @entity6 , which went on sale today , includes a fingerprint sensor that lets users touch the phone 's home button with their finger to unlock it , rather than enter a passcode			1
@entity3 claims its scanner , known as @entity15 , is ‘ one of the best passwords in the world			1
’ but senator @entity0 said that while a password can be kept a secret and changed if it 's hacked , fingerprints are permanent and left on everything a person touches			0
‘ if someone hacks your password , you can change it – as many times as you want , ’ said @entity0 , in his letter			0
‘ you ca n’t change your fingerprints			0
you have only ten of them			0
and you leave them on everything you touch ; they are definitely not a secret			0
’ @entity3 claims this kind of technology boosts security for users			1
it added that the fingerprint data is stored on the phone in a place that 's inaccessible to other apps and to @entity3 's remote servers			1
@entity3 said the @entity15 fingerprint sensor is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now ' touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
users can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			2
@entity15 can also be replace an @entity70 password when buying music , apps or books			2
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - resolution image scan before the @entity78 in @entity80 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip			0
the prints are not stored on an @entity3 server , or backed up to @entity88			2
senator @entity0 said that , unlike a string of numbers , a fingerprint uniquely identifies its owner			0
‘ let me put it this way , ’ he said			0
‘ if hackers get a hold of your thumbprint , they could use it to identify and impersonate you for the rest of your life			1
’ @entity3 is yet to issue an official response to @entity0 , but it has published a support document on its website outlining the security features of @entity15			1
‘ @entity15 does not store any images of your fingerprint			1
it stores only a mathematical representation of your fingerprint , ’ it said			0
‘ it is n’t possible for your actual fingerprint image to be reverse - engineered from this mathematical representation			0
’ ‘ your fingerprint data is never accessed by @entity116 or other apps , never stored on @entity3 servers , and never backed up to @entity88 or anywhere else , ’ it added			1
@entity3 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire - based materials			2
@entity3 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity15 fingerprint scanner on its @entity6 , pictured , and to protect the cameras on its latest models			1
rumours now claim @entity3 could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens @entity3 's @entity132 , pictured , explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip , and not online			2
yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere even before the new @entity6 was released , a group of hackers pooled their funds to offer a bounty of over £ 10,000 , bottles of booze and other prizes , for the first person that can crack the @entity6 ’s @entity15 fingerprint sensors			1
@entity149 , the creation of security researcher @entity151 , said it is hoping to help @entity3 identify bugs that it may have missed			2
security engineer @entity153 said it could take fewer than two weeks for a smart hacker to get around the new lock			0
among those getting ready for the hacking contest is @entity158 , a former @entity159 cyber-intelligence analyst who did two tours in @entity161 and now runs his own consulting firm , @entity162 @entity158 said he needs to examine the new @entity163 to figure out how to best attempt an attack			0
he said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data , or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom - built device that would impersonate @entity3 's fingerprint reader			1
he added that it might be possible to lift a user 's fingerprint from elsewhere on the device and somehow make a clone of it			0
the @entity15 sensor is built into the premium phone 's ' home ' button and can be used to unlock the phone , as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or pin			1
speaking at the launch event in @entity190 , @entity3 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing @entity132 said : ' half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords			1
[ @entity15 ] is an easier and more fun alternative			2
' it uses key you have with you everywhere you go			0
' it works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			0
a user can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			2
@entity15 can also replace an @entity70 password when buying music , apps or books			0
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity78 in @entity80 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
@entity3 said it is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now			1
' @entity132 reassured users that @entity15 is secure by explaining that ' all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip ' adding the prints are not stored on an @entity3 server , or backed up to @entity88 .			1

touch id feature allows you to use your fingerprint to unlock the @entity6
@entity3 maintains that @entity15 is ' one of the best passwords in the world '
but the @entity29 is concerned about hackers getting hold of fingerprints
' they could use it to impersonate you for the rest of your life , ' he said
