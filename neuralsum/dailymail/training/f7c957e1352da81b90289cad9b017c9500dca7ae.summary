by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:31 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 24 april 2013 @entity2 is in danger of being forced by @entity5 judges to allow @entity7 - style political advertisements to be shown on television			2
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) is due to rule tomorrow on a test case brought by a @entity2 - based animal rights group			1
insiders fear the verdict will go against the government , meaning any political group can buy time on @entity2 television			1
the @entity9 will rule on whether it 's right to ban an advert by an animal rights group about the abuse of apes			1
a win for the group could pave the way for political ' attack ' adverts in @entity2 but justice secretary @entity28 last night vowed to resist the threat			1
any change would mean that organisations and individuals ranging from rich businessmen with outspoken views to unions , animal rights groups and campaigners on both sides in the abortion and climate change debates could win air time to promote their views , win votes or change the law			1
a ruling in favour of political advertisements will also spark fresh controversy over whether the @entity9 has the right to overrule mps at @entity51			1
mr @entity28 told @entity52 : ‘ i have very serious misgivings about the fact that the court considers this issue to be within its remit			0
it raises major questions about the role of the @entity9 in @entity2			1
‘ the ban on political advertising was put there for a purpose : to protect the integrity of our democracy			2
any change should be a matter for the @entity2 @entity70 , not the @entity9			1
’ mr @entity28 is ready to veto any ruling in favour of political advertisements by the @entity9 , triggering a re-run of the still unresolved battle with the @entity5 court over its demand that @entity2 gives votes to prisoners			1
the 2003 @entity79 bans all television advertisements ‘ of a political nature or directed towards changing the law ; influencing elections , @entity14 policy or public opinion on controversial matters ; promoting a political party or in connection with an industrial dispute ’			2
the @entity2 law is being taken on by animal protection organisation , @entity91			2
the group has launched several legal challenges , after it was banned from broadcasting a tv advert as part of its ‘ my mate ’s a @entity100 ’ campaign			2
the advert focused on the abuse of apes and featured a young actress and the voice of comedian @entity106			0
the advert being ruled on features a young actress caged like an ape			0
if the @entity91 win their case , it will pave the way for further adverts by charities , animal rights groups and political parties critics of the ban , which prohibits a wide range of adverts by charities and campaigners as well as political parties , say it is being challenged because it contravenes the @entity9 guarantee to freedom of expression			1
at present , the main political parties are allowed a set number of party political broadcasts , shown mainly in the run - up to elections and based on how many votes they won at the last election			1
they are not classed as political advertisements			0
some officials say the @entity138 - based @entity9 may decide to maintain a narrow ban on advertisements by political parties			1
but it would still leave a huge scope for commercials that directly or indirectly play a role in domestic politics , bringing @entity2 media laws more into line with the @entity7 , where single - issue groups play a crucial role in elections			0
billions of dollars are spent on political advertisements in @entity7			0
most are negative , based on personal and often distorted claims about an opponent			0
one lawyer said : ‘ commercial companies are free to advertise on television , regardless of whether their products are any benefit to society as a whole			0
yet there is a total ban on charities			0
that is completely illogical and unjustifiable			0
’ a @entity167 source said : ‘ if the @entity9 goes against us on this it will cause as big a row as votes for prisoners			2
it will make us even more determined to pull out of the @entity173			0
‘ political adverts give the rich the chance to influence elections			2
‘ most people would be horrified by the prospect of @entity7 - style political campaigns on our screens			0
‘ they would also be a gift to union barons who could use their coffers to drum up support for strikes			1
’ some @entity189 fear a change could benefit the @entity191 who have a greater number of wealthy donors			0
but the stance of @entity196 and the @entity197 could be affected by their strong support for the @entity9			1
a spokesman for @entity200 , @entity201 , said : ‘ the government successfully defended the ban on political advertising in the @entity2 courts and we are confident that the government ’s firm stance on this issue is correct			0
political adverts are – and have always been – banned on @entity2 tv and radio			2
‘ that ban has wide support and has helped sustain the balance of views which is at the heart of @entity2 broadcasting – and ensures that advertising broadcast into our homes is not determined by those who have the deepest pockets			0

@entity9 to rule on advert by animal rights group
rules currently *prevent* commercials from charities and political parties
tories fear defeat could pave way for union barons to use adverts to drum up support for strikes
