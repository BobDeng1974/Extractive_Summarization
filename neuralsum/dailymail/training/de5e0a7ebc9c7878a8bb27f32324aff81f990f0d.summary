a floating island of debris the size of @entity3 has been crossing the vast @entity4 to the western shores of the @entity6 since a devastating tsunami inundated @entity8 in 2011 , says a new study			1
five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes , boats , and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern @entity8 - were swallowed by the ocean that day in march , and more than one million tons of flotsam continues to head towards the west coast of the @entity19			1
while the first documented debris from the tragedy has already been found in @entity23 , scientists fear these new findings mean there could be a lot more to come and it might arrive all at once			2
gigantic : a floating island of debris the size of @entity3 is floating toward @entity23 coast after washing into the @entity4 in @entity8 's horrific 2011 tsunami slowly but surely : the @entity3 - sized trash island is floating to the northeast of @entity34 after over two years of sailing across the @entity4 the @entity37 and @entity38 ( @entity36 ) released its updated findings last week , which show the huge island floating northeast of the @entity41			1
@entity36 scientists add that a larger and less - concentrated debris field stretches from @entity44 to the @entity45			0
an estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in march of 2011 during the tsunami			1
around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the @entity8 coast			0
some more mobile items may have reached the @entity52 before 2011 even came to a close			0
the first documented piece of debris to arrive in @entity23 , a barnacle covered fishing boat , came ashore in april 2013			1
the particles are dispersed sparsely from @entity44 to the @entity45			0
the @entity3 - sized trash island is located northeast of the @entity41			1
some of the more mobile items have been documented as washing up on the coast of @entity23 as early as 2011			2
in april , a 20ft boat ran aground at @entity63 , @entity23			2
it was formally identified as a boat that belonged to the marine sciences program at @entity67 in the city of @entity69			0
in all , 27 items from among more than 1,600 reports of debris have been firmly traced back to the tsunami , @entity36 spokeswoman @entity70 said			2
the confirmed items include a small boat found in @entity34 waters , large docks that have washed ashore in @entity79 and @entity80 , and a motorcycle that washed ashore off the coast of @entity83			2
a soccer ball found on an @entity44 island with a student 's name on it was also traced to the city of @entity69			1
but distinguishing everyday trash from tsunami debris has proven difficult in most other cases			1
items that are confirmed as having come from the tsunami , like the soccer ball and boat , tend to have unique markings			1
it â€™s far more difficult to distinguish between domestic and @entity8 everyday wooden debris , for instance			0
geiger counters , which detect radiation , are no help in identifying debris			0
it was initially thought that the instruments might be able to pick up traces of radiation from the still - leaking nuclear reactor at @entity108 , but none of the floating debris has any detectable radioactivity			0
large items : the 164ft @entity8 fishing vessel @entity114 entered @entity19 waters march 31 , 2012 , on its ghostly journey after being washed away by the massive wave			0
the ship eventually sank in the @entity119			0

part of the over one million tons of debris dispersed in the @entity4 , the trash island is located northeast of the @entity41
the first documented tsunami debris to reach @entity23 arrived in april 2013
boats , a dock , a soccer ball , and motorcycle have all been identified on the @entity131 as confirmed tsunami debris
