the @entity1 administration took steps wednesday to cut levels of smog - forming pollution linked to asthma , lung damage and other health problems , bringing jeers from business leaders who warn of trillions in compliance costs and millions of lost jobs			1
and evidence shows that a shifting regulatory environment could drive hundreds of @entity16 counties over the new limit – for no reason other than their proximity to @entity22 's out - of - control smokestack society			1
energy and industry trade groups painted the government 's move as a roadblock that threatens to jeopardize manufacturing 's comeback in the @entity16 and @entity30 @entity29 sen. @entity29 , who will take over the @entity31 in january , is vowing ' vigorous oversight ' of the plan			1
@entity35 sen. @entity34 said wednesday that the @entity37 's planned move ' will shut down job - creating projects in every state			1
' hot seat : @entity37 administrator @entity41 insists that the benefits of changing @entity16 's clean - air standard outweigh any financial and job losses they might cause people 's republic of @entity47 : @entity22 industry has made air in @entity50 practically unbreatheable , and much of that pollution wafts across the @entity52 where it settles in the western @entity16 – in concentrations large enough to earn financial penalties from the federal government @entity57 , president of the @entity58 , warned that ' tightening these standards could be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the @entity16 public , with potentially enormous costs to the economy , jobs , and consumers			1
' @entity57 and other business leaders accused the @entity1 administration of moving the goalposts , since states are still working to implement the previous standard put in place in 2008 by president @entity72			0
but green groups say it 's all just spin			1
' we 've heard the sky - is - falling rhetoric before , ' @entity76 senior scientist @entity75 told @entity80			0
' and in every case , @entity16 ingenuity and creativity have allowed us to move on and to do the things that we need to do to get those control measures in place and to bring cleaner and healthier air to all @entity16			1
' “ we know that the science and the law is clear , ' she said			0
' so we expect @entity37 to do their job and protect public health			2
' the nuts and bolts of the @entity37 's new plan seem modest on the surface : the agency will move to a new , lower threshold for ozone pollution of between 65 and 70 parts per billion , lowering it from 75			1
the @entity37 could , however , push the legal level down as far as 60 parts per billion , a level sought by environmental activists			1
dropping the limbo bar even 5 points could draw new legal challenges from western @entity16 states where studies show @entity22 factories are dumping enough ozone and other pollution to push them over the new limit			1
a 2012 study published in the @entity117 found that pollution wafting across the @entity52 from @entity119 can contribute up to 20 percent of the ground - level ozone measured in @entity121 and elsewhere			1
the @entity123 - led research team determined that in the springtime , @entity119 's dirty air adds between 8 and 15 parts per billion of ozone to atmospheric measurements in the @entity16 if nothing else , an industry analyst told @entity130 on wednesday , lowering permissible ozone levels across the country could put west - coast states at a competitive disadvantage in attracting new businesses			1
the six @entity16 cities and towns with the highest ground - level ozone levels are all in @entity121 , according to the @entity139			1
in july @entity22 officials recorded the worst smog days in @entity143 's history			2
primer : @entity145 is a good thing in the upper atmosphere but can be harmful at ground level , produced by chemical reactions brought on by emissions from cars , factories and power plants @entity155 sen. @entity154 has introduced a bill that would tie the @entity37 's hands and force it to postpone its plan			1
' i expect there to be strong , bipartisan opposition to what will be the most expensive @entity37 regulation in history , ' @entity154 said monday in a statement			0
legislation co-sponsor @entity168 , a @entity171 @entity170 senator , complained wednesday that ' as @entity16 prepare to celebrate @entity173 with their friends and families , the @entity172 has taken the opportunity to roll out what some experts estimate could be the most expensive regulation ever			2
' ' almost 9 million people are still looking for good - paying jobs nationwide			0
the last thing workers and families in @entity171 need is yet another burdensome regulation that will further stifle jobs and economic opportunity			0
' in 2010 the @entity37 proposed setting the permissible ozone levels in the air to somewhere between 60 to 70 parts per billion			2
that level would have doubled the number of @entity16 counties who violate the rule			0
in addition to @entity16 's smog capitals like @entity198 and @entity199 , smaller regions including a county in @entity202 with a population of just 3,000 would find themselves facing fines – and passing costs on to businesses			2
there 's broad disagreement about how much the @entity37 's new plan will cost industry , and whether all those costs will ultimately be borne by consumers			1
business groups say it would be nearly impossible for oil refineries and large manufacturers to comply without going bankrupt			0
a study commissioned by the @entity217 determined that @entity16 's @entity218 will shrink by $ 270 billion per year and carry a compliance price tag of $ 2.2 trillion , while wiping out $ 3.4 trillion in economic output and 2.9 million jobs by the end of 2040			0
' this would be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the @entity16 public , ' the @entity217 said in july			0
its main concern is the difficulty a new clean - air standard would pose for companies looking to open new manufacturing plants			0
by federal law , the @entity37 is required to make its recommendations and set policy without considering the costs			0
new sheriff : sen. @entity29 , an @entity30 @entity170 famous for deriding ' global warming ' as junk science , will chair the @entity31 in january the agency claims industry will only have to spend about $ 3.9 billion in 2025 , the first year the new regulation would take effect , if the standard of 70 parts per billion holds			0
that cost , the @entity37 says , would grow to $ 15 billion if the final rule sets the limit at 65 parts per billion			2
@entity37 administrator @entity41 told the @entity248 that lower ozone standards would actually spur more businesses , investment and jobs by making communities healthier , repeating the administration 's long - held view that government - nudged green investment is a net economic gain			1
' critics play a dangerous game when they denounce the science and law @entity37 has used to defend clean air for more than 40 years , ' she wrote in an op - ed for @entity265 's website			2
' the @entity16 people know better			0
' in a statement wednesday , she insisted that ' bringing ozone pollution standards in line with the latest science will clean up our air , improve access to crucial air quality information , and protect those most at - risk			0
' ' it empowers the @entity16 people with updated air quality information to protect our loved ones – because whether we work or play outdoors – we deserve to know the air we breathe is safe			0
' @entity41 's @entity37 is under a court - ordered dec. 1 deadline to issue its new smog standard			2
the proposal will also fulfill a pledge president @entity1 made during his first @entity289 campaign – one that he reneged on during a contentious 2012 re-election campaign .			0

pollution levels wafting from @entity22 could be enough to push the entire western @entity16 over @entity37 's new limit for ground - level ozone
industry calls it a job - *killer* and puts long - term cost in the trillions
green groups insist ' @entity16 ingenuity ' will catch up
@entity37 says benefits will outweigh the costs
new @entity170 @entity309 could block implementation in 2015
