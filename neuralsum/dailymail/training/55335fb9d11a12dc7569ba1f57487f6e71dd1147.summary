by @entity1 reporter published : 19:18 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 19:18 est , 22 november 2013 the company that employed the @entity4 shooter pulled his access to classified material for two days in august when mental health problems became evident , but restored it quickly and never told @entity10 officials about the withdrawal , the @entity1 has learned			1
an initial @entity10 review revealed that the @entity14 , @entity15 - based company , the experts , ordered computer contractor @entity17 back to @entity19 , after a police incident in @entity21 in august , according to senior @entity23 officials			1

it did not disclose why his access was reinstated			0
less than six weeks later , the former @entity10 reservist gunned down 12 civilian workers in a @entity4 building , and police fatally shot him			1
the experts did not immediately return messages seeking comment			0
access denied : @entity4 shooter @entity17 had his access to classified information denied six weeks before the shooting the classified access revelation has raised questions about whether the company 's disclosure of the discipline could have brought @entity17 to @entity10 officials ' attention earlier and perhaps prevented the massacre			1
the @entity10 did an initial review into the matter , but it has not yet been released			0
officials also have done a full investigation , including what prompted the company 's decision and why the government was never told			0
@entity61 leaders now are reviewing that report			0
the shooting spree triggered several @entity10 and @entity64 reviews into base security and contractor requirements , including questions about how thorough the background checks are for security clearances and whether more vigilant monitoring and reassessments should be done			2
while the @entity10 reviews have not been released , navy secretary @entity72 has sent out a notice to the fleet directing all commanders and civilian leaders in the @entity10 to scrutinize the records of any personnel who are allowed to access classified information			1
psychological reasons : @entity17 ' access was denied for psychological reasons after an incident with police in @entity21 in the message , @entity72 said that this new records review should look at credit card delinquencies , discipline , police or legal reports and urinalysis reports			1
@entity72 said that if information is discovered that had not been disclosed already , it must be reported , and commanders must determine whether the employee 's access to classified data should be cut off			2
he ordered commanders to submit full reports to @entity10 and @entity102 leaders on what they found and any actions taken by mid-january			0
according to officials familiar with the @entity10 investigation , the experts removed @entity17 ' access to secret information on august 7 and restored access on august 9 , but there is nothing in the record explaining the decisions			1
the timing , however , aligns with the day @entity17 called @entity116 , @entity21 , police , complaining that voices were harassing him through a wall at his hotel and he worried they might harm him			1
killer : @entity17 killed 12 people during his assault on the @entity4 building before being fatally shot by police police said they were called to the @entity127 around 6 a.m. on aug. 7 , and @entity17 told them he was in town as a naval contractor and that he believed people were following him and using a microwave machine to send vibrations into his body so he could not fall asleep			1
police alerted the local @entity10 base that day that @entity17 was hearing voices , but the information went no further			1
under @entity23 rules , the experts was required to report any behavior that could be considered detrimental to security , and that information was supposed to be passed along to the commander at the @entity4			2
@entity17 began working at the @entity4 this summer refreshing computer systems			1
the experts said it ran two background checks on @entity17 that turned up only a traffic violation			0
it also said the @entity64 confirmed twice that @entity17 had a valid security clearance			0
@entity17 was granted a secret - level security clearance while in the @entity10 , and it carried over when he went to work as a computer contractor			1
he was granted access to the @entity4 and to building 197 as an employee of the experts , a @entity157 subcontractor			1
delusional : @entity17 had been suffering from hallucinations and other psychological issues prior to the shooting @entity157 has said it was severing ties with the experts , saying the company failed to respond appropriately to @entity17 ' mental health issues			0
@entity157 has told @entity23 officials that it did not receive any adverse information reports on @entity17 before the september 16 shooting			2
in a note he left behind and found by investigators after the shooting , @entity17 claimed that he was driven to the shooting rampage because he was being bombarded by extremely low - frequency radio waves			0
the @entity174 has said that the note , along with peculiar carved notations on his gun , suggested he was in the throes of profound paranoia and delusions			0
his shotgun , which he purchased two days before the shooting from a gun shop in @entity184 , was etched with messages including ' my @entity186 ! ' — an apparent reference to extremely low - frequency waves — and ' end to @entity190 ! ' in response to the shooting , @entity72 ordered a series of reviews , including four quick studies on @entity10 career , contractor obligations , the security clearance process and physical base security			2
he also ordered two longer reviews — one on physical security and one encompassing a full investigation into exactly how the events of the shooting unfolded			0
all six reviews have been completed , but they have not yet been released			0
@entity72 said that investigation into the shooting must determine whether @entity157 and the experts complied with background investigation requirements ; find out who knew about the august police incident and clearance action ; figure out what happened and whether it was reported as required ; and if government or military officials were notified , find out whether proper procedures were followed .			2

@entity17 ' access to classified information was *revoked* for two days in august after an incident with @entity21 police
his @entity10 contractor employer quickly restored his access but never told the @entity10 about the incident
less than six weeks later , @entity17 gunned down 12 people at the @entity4 building in @entity19
