@entity0 is said to be ‘ furious ’ , ‘ seething ’ and ‘ very angry ’ at his latest @entity2 fine and ban			1
he is also said , by ‘ a close source ’ , to feel victimised , picked upon and singled out for special punishment by the people who control the @entity8 game			2
he is therefore , we are told , considering withdrawing his support for future @entity2 initiatives			1
outrage , resentment , revenge : it was an average week in the life of @entity17 ’s occasional central defender			1
@entity0 was banned for three games and fined £ 25,000 for controversial ' sket ' tweet his offence was to post a deeply offensive message on @entity22 , the spiritual home of deeply offensive messages			1
replying to a @entity26 fan , who suggested that @entity17 needed to sign a new centre - back , @entity0 wrote : ‘ get ya mum in , plays the field well son ! # sket ’			1
the world now knows that ‘ sket ’ is @entity33 slang for a loose woman			2
the world has yet to comprehend the mind which can blurt out that vile response to a daft little jibe			2
the @entity2 have not always coped impressively with questions of discipline but this time they seem to have struck precisely the correct balance			1
aware that football has genuine problems with sexism issues , and aware that @entity0 has a @entity22 following of almost six million , they handed down an exemplary sentence of a three - game ban , a £ 25,000 fine and an order to attend an education programme			1
it was a timely expression of disapproval and an important statement of principle			2
@entity0 poses with @entity56 trophy alongside @entity57 ( left ) with the @entity58 in 2008 here we might remember just what an extraordinary player @entity0 has been			1
he captained his country , won 81 caps and proved himself one of the finest footballing central defenders @entity8 football has known			2
he played in six @entity58 - winning sides at @entity26 , with whom he won the @entity56			2
in short , he was a marvellous player and the @entity8 game has yet to discover his successor			2
but in @entity0 ’s case , the past tense is inevitable			1
on friday , he will be 36 years old and his future at the top level is clearly limited			2
it had seemed likely that he would move on to an important administrative role , especially when he was chosen to serve on @entity77 ’s commission into the future of @entity8 football			2
yet always there was a disturbing unpredictability			2
in 2003 he served an eight - month suspension for missing a drugs test			2
then there was his despicable @entity22 outburst in 2012 , when he appeared to endorse a tweet which referred to @entity87 as a ‘ choc ice ’ after @entity87 had given evidence in a high - profile trial			2
former @entity91 left back @entity87 has also been fined in the past for inappropriate comments on @entity22 @entity87 may not be everyone ’s idea of a model citizen , but he did not deserve such a wicked racial slur			2
@entity0 was fined £ 45,000 for that transgression and while his own sense of self - importance seemed resolutely undaunted , even his erstwhile admirers were becoming increasingly critical			1
his most recent offence seems miserably typical , despite the efforts of his fawning chums to search out helpful precedents			2
we are told , for instance , that the @entity2 allowed the @entity58 chief executive @entity108 to go unpunished for his tawdry email exchanges			1
in @entity108 ’s case , it was argued that these were private communications which were never intended for public viewing			0
more recently , we had the attention - seeking irritant @entity115 , a @entity17 colleague of @entity0 , tweeting a moronic sexual slur on the @entity119 players @entity117 and @entity120			1
no measures have yet been instigated against @entity115 and the @entity2 may well decide that by far the most wounding course of action would be to ignore him			1
the @entity2 allowed @entity58 chief @entity108 to go unpunished for his email exchanges all of which leaves @entity0 with a decision			1
he can opt for arrogant indignation : nursing his grievances , witholding whatever useful influence he possesses and seeking to settle scores with his interminable tweeting			0
or he can choose the difficult alternative , which involves ignoring the sycophants and taking a hard look at himself			0
i have no idea which course he will adopt , although his initial laddish truculence seems faintly ominous : ‘ is humour even allowed … i ’m baffled			0
ludicrous … ’ but i do hope he does not cast himself adrift			0
for all his mistakes and fumbling misdeeds , @entity0 may yet have a good deal to offer @entity8 football			1
sure , he has bridges to mend and a reputation to restore but memories are short and his potential is considerable			0
accepting the @entity2 punishment without comment or complaint might be a good place to start			1
@entity152 has found his voice again welcome back , @entity154 , distinguished chairman of @entity155			1
for too long , the parody of the professional @entity157 has seemed reluctant to address the nation			0
at last , his silence has been broken			0
we used to hear a lot from @entity163 ; too much , some thought			0
you will recall his enlightened views on football and race : ‘ i just think we should forget colour and , you know , it does n’t bother anybody , i ’m sure			0
when they ’re playing at such a level , the stress is there			0
and if they call somebody white , if they call somebody black , you ’ve just got to get on with it			0
’ there was his contentious , though ultimately unheeded , request for the whole of @entity8 football to observe a minute ’s silence to mark the demise of @entity188			0
@entity190 chairman @entity154 has been involved in a long - running feud with @entity192 then his suggestion that the @entity195 national team be coached by a combination of @entity197 and @entity198			1
he always had grave doubts about foreigners , did @entity163 : ‘ you need four or five @entity203 players in any [ club ] squad to give it some heart and depth , ’ he said			0
‘ they also give you leadership and they fight to the death			0
’ but of one thing @entity163 was quite certain : he did not like @entity192 , the owner of @entity213 and a man once seen as a threat to @entity163 ’s authority in the northern sports goods business			1
@entity154 is famously reported to have told @entity192 : ‘ there ’s a club in the @entity220 , son			1
and you ’re not part of it			0
’ the warning went unheeded as @entity192 prompted a series of investigations into the way the industry was conducted			1
@entity154 ’s company incurred an £ 8million fine			1
@entity163 never forgave that expensive affront			0
some time later , after @entity192 had bought @entity213 , @entity154 remarked : ‘ he [ @entity192 ] turned up in the boardroom in a pair of jeans , a pair of trainers and a replica shirt			1
he ’s got no class whatsoever			0
’ having built his own fortune upon trainers and replica shirts , it seemed a curious complaint			0
@entity213 owner @entity192 acquired a 10 per cent stake in @entity246 last week hostilities were resumed last week , following news that @entity192 had acquired a 10 per cent stake in @entity246			1
‘ if i was [ a @entity246 fan ] and a stranger from @entity195 started buying my club , i ’d be worried , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d ask myself , “ has he got @entity246 at heart ? ” it ’s like me and @entity155 , i am @entity155 through and through and i ’ll do anything i can for them			1
it ’s that kind of owner that supporters want			0
’ then , without a word of warning , he played his joker and astounded us all			0
aware of idle speculation that @entity192 hopes one day to move the club into @entity195 ’s @entity58 , @entity154 declared : ‘ it would great for the @entity58 if they extended the league , do n’t put anybody out , and bring @entity270 and @entity246 in			1
’ so there ! according to @entity154 , the richest league in @entity273 would somehow be enhanced by the addition of a desperately ordinary @entity270 team and a @entity246 side currently second in the @entity277			1
some would dismiss that as a piece of addled absurdity			0
they do well to remember that a wise man was speaking			0
and we are richer for @entity163 ’s wisdom			0
getting to grips with evil at last a good week for the football authorities			0
not only did the @entity2 deal decisively with @entity0 but the @entity2 imposed a seven - match ban upon @entity270 ’s @entity289 for racially abusing the @entity291 defender @entity290			1
@entity289 has lodged an appeal against the verdict but , as things stand , it seems a salutary sentence for an unacceptable offence			1
@entity289 was banned for seven games for racially abusing @entity291 defender @entity290 ( left ) in the past , the various powers - that - be have tended to deflect such issues by mumbling trite platitudes about ‘ harmless banter ’ and ‘ what happens on the field , stays on the field ’			1
these days , the evil is confronted and punished			0
and we all become slightly more civilised as a result			0
@entity308 the hucksters who run @entity311 are concerned that their championship is losing its appeal			0
they have therefore decided to spice things up by introducing a game - show gimmick : double points will be awarded for the @entity318 , the final race of the season , on november 23			2
this is rather like announcing that all goals will count double in the final week of the football season , or that the value of runs will be doubled for the final test of a series			0
rather like motor racing itself , it has everything to do with commercial calculation and little to do with sport			0
this tacky wheeze is apparently the brainchild of @entity336			0
why are we not surprised ?			0
