he said : ‘ i recently visited my brother in hospital in @entity37 only to find that using the television stationed above his bed would cost him £ 6 a day			1
’ he called on mr @entity7 to ‘ justify why it costs hospital patients £ 42 a week to watch the television when it costs prisoners only £ 1 a week to do so ’			1

‘ i have spent many an hour battling with that very complicated telephone and credit card system that people have to try and make work			0
i am afraid , though , that these are devolved decisions that local hospitals can now make for themselves			0
’ @entity63 : @entity32 mp @entity31 said the high costs were the result of government departments not communicating however , mr @entity7 said justice secretary @entity67 is acting to crackdown on excessive perks in prisons			1

‘ he is also making sure that prisoners pay if they use the television			2
’ a @entity80 spokeswoman confirmed prisoners pay £ 1 a week to watch television			2
she added : ‘ that comes at no cost to taxpayers as prisoners pay for it themselves			2

‘ it is why government need to look overall to make sure you do n’t end up with this sort of situation			0
