by @entity0 almost half of all adults could be offered statins under new guidelines from the health watchdog			1
@entity6 is advising @entity7 to consider prescribing the pills to up to 17million patients to prevent heart disease			0
family doctors are being urged to trawl medical records to find patients at risk who will then be invited in for check - ups			1
family doctors are being asked to trawl through the medical records of patients to find those at risk from the side - affects of statins , then book check - up appointments which they warn could over-burden surgeries however , gps say that already overstretched surgeries will be deluged with patients booking the check - ups , leading to even longer waiting times for appointments			1
other doctors warn that the population faces being ‘ medicalised ’ when too little is known about the potential side - effects			1
the known side - effects include type 2 diabetes and severe muscular pain and there is also evidence that patients regard the pills as an excuse to lead unhealthy lifestyles			1
guidelines issued by @entity6 today tell @entity7 to consider prescribing statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade ( generally people over the age of 40 )			1
currently , they are offered to patients with a 20 per cent risk			1
@entity6 estimates that between five and ten million adults are currently taking the drugs , although 12.5million are eligible			2
but under the new guidelines , another 4.5million would qualify			2
this means that 17million adults – nearly half of the 37million adults in @entity59 – would either be on statins or offered them			1
@entity6 estimates that it would cost the @entity62 an extra £ 52million to prescribe statins to the 4.5million adults newly eligible			1
experts say if all eligible patients took statins , 510,000 heart attacks or strokes could be prevented a year			0
professor @entity70 , director of the @entity71 at @entity6 , said : ‘ statins are safe and effective and now they are cheaper it is a good deal for more people to have access to them under the @entity62			0
‘ the overwhelming body of evidence supports their use , even in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease			0
the effectiveness of these medicines is now well proven and their cost has fallen			0
‘ it is ludicrous to suggest that we are over-medicalising the population when the whole point of using modern , safe and effective drugs in an economic way is to prevent bad things happening in the future			0
’ however , dr @entity94 , chair of the @entity96 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ in making their decision @entity6 have failed to take the current pressures on general practice into account , and the further impact this will have on already overstretched gps and those patients requiring treatment for other illnesses			0
’ other experts say there is no evidence the drugs prevent heart attacks or strokes in healthy patients who do n’t have heart disease			0
dr @entity115 , a gp and deputy chair of the @entity96 who stopped taking statins after developing crippling muscle pain , said : ‘ these guidelines mean you are medicalising millions of the population without any evidence			1
‘ statins have an important role for patients who already have heart disease			0
but for healthy patients , the benefits are very , very minimal			0
' when people have side effects and they need follow - up investigations and scans they are going to take up a lot of time and @entity62 resources			1
’ dr @entity137 , a cardiologist who also runs the @entity138 , said : ‘ a mass prescription to millions of healthy people will not benefit population health and will contribute to excess costs			0
' low - risk patients must be told statins will not reduce their risk of death			2
what i see with my own patients is they think they have got the magic pill , which is an excuse to gorge on junk food			0
’ last month it emerged that six of the 12 - strong panel of experts drawing up the @entity6 guidelines had financial links to drugs firms making statins , or similar pills			2
at the time a group of leading doctors wrote to @entity6 and the health secretary @entity163 urging them to rethink the proposed guidelines .			2

statins could be offered to half of all adults in @entity59 under new guidelines
doctors asked to check patient records for those at risk of side effects
check ups will then be *scheduled* , potentially causing *backlogs* at surgeries
