good team : @entity10 's owner @entity30 , 54 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , is the chief of the division of sea turtle science and recovery at @entity36 saved : the eggs are then transported to the incubation unit for specialist care			1
@entity10 is thought to have saved as many as hundreds of turtles throughout his career search : when @entity10 is first brought to a site he is told to ' find the nest '			1
the dog understands the instructions and sniffs the sand to find the eggs @entity30 said : ' we use @entity10 when we can see tracks left by the female but they have disappeared in the soft sand and we can not find the nests			1
' we only take @entity10 into the field a few times a year			1
my staff are very good at finding nests , and @entity10 is only brought out after they have searched a site for hours			2
' we do not want to bring him out to a lot of sites because the beach is a very harsh environment			0
it is quite hot and to access sites we must drive on the beach , which can be quite bumpy			0
' first and foremost he is my beloved pet and we do not want any harm to come to him			2
' when @entity10 is first brought to a site he is told to ' find the nest '			2
the dog understands the instructions and sniffs the sand to find the eggs			0
when he finds the nest he stops and gently paws at the sand			0
staff then carefully dig down further to determine if eggs are there			0
@entity30 said : ' we use @entity10 when we can see tracks left by the female but they have disappeared in the soft sand and we can not find the nests ' @entity30 said : ' @entity10 knows it is important to me to find the eggs - he has watched me work with the eggs and hatchlings since he was a young pup			1
' when we bring him to a site we walk him up and down the beach where the tracks are located and where we think the nest could be			0
' sometimes there is no nest and the turtle has just come out of the sea , but by using @entity10 we can be sure we do not miss any nests			2
' after the eggs are found they are carefully packed into foam incubation boxes and transported to the incubation facility for protected care			0
recovered : turtles being examined at the @entity119			0
last year , a record 206 nests were recovered the eggs remain in the facility for about 48 - 53 days prior to hatching			0
the hatchlings are then released on the beach and allowed to go free			0
@entity10 is the first dog on the team to become a fully independent searcher			2
there were two other dogs on the team , but neither were able to search alone			0
@entity30 said : ' i had two other dogs that we started training , but neither became fully independent searchers			0
' unfortunately , one of those died at 22 months			0
after she died @entity10 became despondent so we soon got another red @entity9 female that we named @entity142			1
' @entity142 is still in training , but she has never gone to a site without @entity10			2
she occasionally goes with @entity10 for training , but they do not work as a team			1
' @entity30 says it is impossible to say how many turtles @entity10 has saved , but thinks the number would be well into the hundreds			1
such are the efforts the number of found nests increased from 5 in 1996 to 50 in 2005			0
last year , a record 206 nests were recovered .			0
