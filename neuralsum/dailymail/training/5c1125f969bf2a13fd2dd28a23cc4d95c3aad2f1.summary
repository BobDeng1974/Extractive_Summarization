the role of @entity2 ’s top mandarin in promoting the controversial £ 28billion takeover of the defence giant @entity4 by a @entity6 rival was last night under the spotlight			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity8 has helped persuade @entity9 to back the plans to join @entity4 with @entity11			1
but he faces questions about his own role – and whether it constitutes a conflict of interest because he worked for three years at merchant bank @entity17 , which stands to gain tens of millions from brokering the merger			1
cabinet secretary : sir @entity8 , with his wife @entity19 sir @entity8 ’s declaration of meetings with outside bodies reveals he has held four private sessions with @entity4 executives – in may and july last year , and again in january and march – and one with @entity11			1
since the election he has also twice met senior figures from @entity17 , which is advising @entity4 – in october 2010 and october 2011 – for whom he worked between 2003 and 2007 as head of @entity2 investment banking			1
senior government sources yesterday admitted that mr @entity9 is prepared to back the merger since it will give @entity4 access to the lucrative civil aviation sector			2
this will happen if guarantees are given about protecting national security and reassuring the @entity38 that the plans would not compromise @entity41 secrets			0
a senior @entity43 source said : ‘ he is basically supportive and if he can be reassured on a number of points he will do all he can to talk to the @entity38			0
‘ we are in a world where defence budgets are falling and by linking @entity4 with @entity11 you can create a better balance between civil and defence products			1
’ the @entity43 official admitted that sir @entity8 has played an instrumental role in government talks with @entity4			1
‘ he ’s certainly been involved in the discussions , ’ said the official			0
‘ when a company like @entity4 has close relations with the government and is involved in discussions about mergers they would want to be plugged into the centre of government to hear its views			2
’ decision : sir @entity8 has helped persuade prime minister @entity9 ( pictured ) to back the plans to join @entity4 with @entity11 @entity71 mps are in uproar at the plans , which will see @entity2 ’s main defence contractor run by a @entity75 from a headquarters in @entity77			1
they believe it will leave the @entity2 defence industry at the mercy of @entity6 , endanger @entity2 jobs and damage relations with the @entity38			2
' when a company like @entity4 has close relations with the government and is involved in discussions about mergers they would want to be plugged into the centre of government to hear its views ' senior @entity43 official some 5000 @entity89 work for @entity4 at its bases in @entity91 , @entity92 ; @entity93 , @entity94 ; and @entity95 , @entity96			0
and last night @entity97 , who has 6,000 @entity4 workers in his @entity100 and @entity101 constituency , delivered a coded warning that sir @entity8 ’s enthusiasm for the plans is not shared by the @entity71			1
mr @entity97 did not attack sir @entity8 by name			1
but he said : ‘ the government has to tread a fine line between arbitrating on the take - over and not being led down the garden path by those who have a vested interest			0
if the recession has taught us anything it is : beware of bankers bearing gifts			0
’ he added : ‘ there is great concern about handing our defence industrial base to a company controlled by the @entity77 and @entity75 states			0
@entity4 takeover : @entity71 mps are in uproar at the plans , which will see @entity2 's main defence contractor run by a @entity75 from a headquarters in @entity77			2
that can not be good for our relations with the @entity38 or the demand from the @entity135 for more competition in defence procurement			0
’ @entity126 are also privately concerned that the @entity138 has signalled support for the deal , when the @entity106 also has to oversee the deal			0
' it 's no surprise the cabinet secretary often meets with @entity2 ’s major employers			0
his role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement ' sir @entity8 's spokesman department of business sources say it is ‘ very likely ’ that business secretary @entity152 will have to refer it to the @entity154 and potentially to the @entity155 as well			1
mr @entity152 has refused to state his views , since he will be expected to behave in a quasi-judicial manner and avoid the pitfalls that befell the government ’s handling of the @entity163 empire ’s bid for @entity164			0
one mp opposed to the deal said : ‘ i ’m not sure why no 10 are busy telling people @entity9 supports the bid when the government has to act impartially			2
’ a spokesman for sir @entity8 said : ‘ it 's no surprise the cabinet secretary often meets with @entity2 ’s major employers			2
' his role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement			0
’ sources close to sir @entity8 say he left @entity17 more than five years ago and that it would be ‘ absurd ’ to suggest he would profit in any way from the deal .			1
