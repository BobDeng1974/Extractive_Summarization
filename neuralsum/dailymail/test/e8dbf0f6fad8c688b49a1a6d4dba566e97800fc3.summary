' you can win the cup , the league and the @entity5 but it only takes a minute for something to go wrong			2
i would like see @entity1 once again reach the level they had when we won 6 titles in 2009 and i think they are on this path			1
with the mentality that they have , working hard , taking it one day at a time , they can achieve these objectives			0
' @entity1 are very much in form			2
they demonstrated that once again against @entity10 and i hope they will reach the final			2
i know the aims of this club and i know the team will be giving everything to be in that final			0
' @entity0 did , however , warn that his former coach @entity17 would be a formidable opponent should the draw pit @entity1 against @entity61 in the semi-final			1
' the 6 - 1 win over @entity64 demonstrates that in football you really never know what will happen			0
this is the beautiful thing about the game			0
if @entity1 were to meet @entity61 in the semi-finals , then they would really have to be on their guard and concentrate hard because @entity61 are a very strong side			1

we have created it because we know the exact need of the patients but not only the patients , also families because from day to day we know how a patient suffers but also how it affects the family			0
