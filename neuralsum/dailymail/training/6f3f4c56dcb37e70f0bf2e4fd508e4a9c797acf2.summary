it was set up by @entity18 , 26 , from @entity19 , who was featured on @entity21 's show ' my transsexual summer			0
' scroll down to see advert from group supporting petition @entity18 was born a woman but began the process of changing his gender in 2009			2
he has set up a petition calling on @entity1 to stop classifying transexualism as a mental illness mr @entity18 was born female but has been transitioning since 2009 when he took testosterone hormones			1
in 2010 he travelled to @entity34 , @entity35 , to undergo a double mastectomy and male chest contouring			0
in a @entity39 video to promote his campaign , mr @entity18 said : ' i am not sick			0
' gender identity and its role in healthcare has long been the subject of heated debate			0
homosexuality was removed from the list of mental disorders in 1990 , when the @entity50 was last revised and advocates want transsexualism to be removed when it is updated in 2015			1
transsexuals have a strong and constant desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex			0
many have gender reassignment treatment to make their appearance more consistent with their preferred gender			0
this often involves hormone therapy and surgery			0
who listed homosexuality as a mental illness until 1990			2
@entity67 is still classified as a mental disorder recent research suggests gender dysphoria could be caused by hormones not working properly within the womb			1

mr @entity18 wrote on his blog : ' petitioning the @entity1 to remove trans people from the list of mental illnesses is about wanting to change the way medical professionals think about trans people			1
' it is about saying we have the same rights as any other person , we are not mentally deficient , we are able to make sane sensible decisions about our lives , there is nothing deficient about our minds and the only way to ' cure ' transsexuality is for our society to give up its illogical and unscientific attachment to gender binary			0
' there are signs that a shift of opinion is occurring in favour of reclassification			0
in february , 2010 , @entity126 became the first country to remove transgender identity from the category of mental diseases			2
then last year , the @entity132 parliament adopted a resolution calling on @entity1 to change its definition of transsexualism			1
a @entity1 spokesperson said the @entity50 list had to reflect the demands and requirements of the 194 member states .			1
