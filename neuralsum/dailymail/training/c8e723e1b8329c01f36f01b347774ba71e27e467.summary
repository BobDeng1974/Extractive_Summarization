@entity0 knew things had changed a week ago when he walked out on @entity2 to the kind of pop star reception not witnessed since the exceptional days of the @entity6 tennis event			1
if his first week was marked by a series of sublime displays against relatively unthreatening opposition , it was also notable for an unreserved adulation of the defending champion that has taken years to build			0
members of @entity15 , present last week and expected again here ( gasp ) , might have known the feeling @entity0 got when he came out to tackle his first opponent , @entity18			1
focused : @entity0 has performed well in the first week and is confident going into this week putting the work in : @entity0 prepares for his fourth round match on the practice courts good feeling : @entity0 shares a joke with new coach @entity24 on sunday @entity26 training with @entity24 doubtless on monday the greeting will be similar , but the challenge will be very different to that offered by the lightweight , diminutive @entity31			1
the 27 year - old scot could feel positively lilliputian as he walks out alongside @entity35 ’s @entity34			1
the 6ft 8in giant from @entity37 is the fourth of seven men whom @entity0 will have to beat between now and next sunday to successfully defend his title			1
with the way he has played so far , it is easy to forget that last year ’s winner has not reached any final since — the process of returning to his best proving lengthy after back surgery and a change of coach			0
for now , the temptation has to be resisted of thinking ahead to potentially sumptuous matches later in the week , a possible quarter - final against the coming man @entity52 and a semi that would be a repeat of the 2013 final against @entity55			1
@entity34 is more dangerous than anyone @entity0 has met in the previous rounds , even if he looks like he might have got lost on his way to the nearest basketball court			1
tall order : @entity61 @entity34 ( left ) will face @entity0 on monday high society : @entity34 returns to @entity63 of @entity64 in their third round match he shares something with @entity0 in that he first got into the game via playing swingball			1
he graduated to the local junior circuit , where one of his rivals was the prodigiously talented @entity73 , now one of the world ’s finest cricketers			0
@entity34 left @entity35 for three years on the @entity77 college circuit playing for @entity78 , where he was initially known as someone who only pushed the ball gently around and failed to harness his enormous levers			1
at 28 that has all changed and he is one of the most ferocious ball strikers on the tour , aside from having the hefty serve you would expect			0
if a rally lasts more than half - a - dozen shots , he is likely to pull the trigger and try to end it with a death - or - glory winner			0
when @entity0 was in the final last year , the genial giant found himself rooting for the home player and accepts that he has to play the villain when the match starts at around 3pm on monday			1
‘ you could n’t help but hope for @entity0 last year , ’ he admitted			1
‘ i really enjoy watching @entity55 play but at this tournament , given the history , @entity0 had a lot of support , even from other players			2
‘ maybe i ’ll be the bad guy but i need to try to block that out			0
@entity0 has won it now , so i guess there ’s no need for him to go on and win two in a row ! @entity110 status : @entity111 ( second right ) and @entity112 ( third left ) of @entity15 attend @entity114 ‘ it will be amazing just to play on @entity2 , not many people in this sport do it			1
it will be a great experience but i am there to win the match			0
’ @entity34 is a good athlete , to the point where he was once a promising 800 metres runner			2
but while he moves well for someone of his size , he can expect to be dragged all over the court in rallies by @entity0 , a master manipulator of the tennis ball			2
@entity0 ’s uncommon eye picks up a big serve early and is a major factor in why he has compiled such a good record against tall players , whom he teases by keeping the ball sliced low			2
@entity34 ’s serve is a weapon , although just below the most devastating in the game			2
he has delivered 63 aces in three matches so far but been broken six times in 56 service games — and none of his opponents returns as well as @entity0			1
if he keeps his composure as well as he has so far , @entity0 should come through			2
he has enjoyed the experience of being defending champion and was cheerful on sunday amid the eerie calm of @entity114 on its traditional rest day			2
‘ i think after winning it last year , the pressure of wanting to win definitely was finally released , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ obviously i ’m still feeling the pressure and the nerves but this year they are completely different			0
i like having the nerves and i ’m able to use them positively			0
’ big time : @entity0 's celebrity status was boosted by his @entity114 glory in 2013 this week is also a huge test for his new coach @entity24 , although their relationship has clearly worked well to date			1
‘ it ’s great having @entity24 around			0
she ’s a very calm person but also incredibly supportive , so naturally that helps me , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ she ’s also a great listener and if i have any concerns she ’ll listen to them and then we ’ll work through them in practice			0
‘ she has been over to the house a few times but she ’s not living with us			0
it ’s quite important to give each other space , particularly during the @entity169 as you can spend a lot of time together			0
’ defeat on monday would end things abruptly for this fortnight , although it sounds like @entity0 ’s bold appointment of the @entity176 is destined to run further .			0

@entity179 no 1 enjoys star status after his 2013 @entity114 success
@entity0 's next *tie* is against giant @entity61 @entity34
@entity34 has delivered 63 aces in three matches so far
