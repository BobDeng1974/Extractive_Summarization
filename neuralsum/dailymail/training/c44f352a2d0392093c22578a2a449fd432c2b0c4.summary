@entity0 tried his best to stay out of the deflate-gate controversy , but his performance on @entity3 will undoubtedly be pointed to as evidence of ... something			1
the @entity7 quarterback was easily able to tell an under - inflated football from one that was within legal rules during a brief demonstration on the show			1
it is n't clear whether the gag on @entity3 was staged - but @entity0 could tell the inflation of two footballs - down to the pounds - per - square - inch			1
when asked about the deflate-gate scandal , @entity0 demurred : ' you know what ? i have no idea			2
i know that it seems the @entity23 has been on this one now for the last few weeks			0
he is a former @entity29 and the youngest ever - quarterback to pass for 50,000 yards in his career - one of only six in @entity23 history ' obviously there always seems to be some topic going into @entity29 week and this one just happens to be it			2
and yes , i will be asked this a thousand times and to be honest with you , i kind of chuckle because i 'm just glad it has nothing to do with us			0
' when @entity43 asked the former @entity29 whether they thought he could tell the different between an under - inflated ball and a legal one , he said : ' throughout the course of a game , no. a ball will come up and you do n't even think about how it feels			1
you 're just programmed to go through your read , throw the ball , no excuses			0
' ' but we if sat here and just gripped one , i could probably tell the difference			0
' @entity3 handed @entity0 two footballs			2
the first , he correctly guessed at 13psi - within the @entity23 legal limit			0
the second , he guessed - correctly again - was 11 psi , illegal according to the rules of the @entity23			0
the @entity65 champion @entity63 have been under the intense scrutiny ever since they won their trip to the @entity29 earlier this month			2
investigators found that 11 of the 12 balls used by the offense were at least 2psi below the 12.5psi league minimum			0
quarterback @entity73 , who is on his way to a record sixth @entity29 , has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that the balls were under - inflated - despite such footballs being easier to catch and throw and harder to fumble			1
@entity63 quarterback @entity73 has said he had no idea the footballs he was using in the afc championship game were under - inflated			1

former @entity29 was *quizzed* about deflate-gate on @entity3
*unknown* whether bit was staged or whether @entity0 could really tell the difference between a football with 11psi and one with 13psi
@entity63 quarterback @entity73 has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that the footballs he used earlier this month were under - inflated
