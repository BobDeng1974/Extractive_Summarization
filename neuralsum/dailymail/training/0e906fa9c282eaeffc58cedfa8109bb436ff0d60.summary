mr @entity0 ruled that - although the girl was under extreme duress and aged under 16 at the time - he was barred by statute from voiding the marriage a judge says he can not nullify the marriage of a teenage mother who says she was forced at ' gunpoint ' into becoming a bride when she was just 14			1
instead the girl , now 17 and a mother of a one - year - old , must defy her family if she wants the union formally annulled , said mr @entity0 at the @entity14			1
the teenager , who was born in @entity16 and whose family has lived here for 40 years , says she was shipped out to @entity19 to contract a forced marriage with a 24 - year - old man two years ago			1
she told how she was subjected to ' harrowing ' violence and menaced with a gun to go through with the ceremony - and was two weeks later forced to have sex with her ‘ husband ’ , giving birth to his baby who is now aged just over one			2
after she came forward with her account , her local authority took both her and her baby into care and asked mr @entity0 to formally declare that her marriage - which effectively made her a rape victim - could never have been recognised under @entity37 law			1
however , in a unique decision , the judge ruled that - although the girl was under extreme duress and aged under 16 at the time - he was barred by statute from granting a declaration that her marriage was ' at its inception , void '			1
expressing sympathy for the girl and the ' real stigma ' she faced , the judge said his hands were tied and he simply had no power to make a formal ruling that ' there never was a marriage ' capable of recognition in @entity37 and @entity55			2
despite the council ’s plea that the girl should not be forced to take ' an active step ' in defiance of her family , the judge said her only option was to launch court action herself , seeking nullification of her marriage			1
whether she wanted to take that course was ' her own decision ' , he told the court			0
mr @entity0 said it was , according to the girl ’s account , a ' grave example of a marriage which was forced under considerable duress , involving at one stage the production of a gun and physical violence upon the girl '			1
her father , who moved to the @entity16 40 years ago and has been a @entity16 citizen for three decades , and her older brother had accompanied her on the trip to @entity19 , which culminated in her becoming an unwilling bride			2
the teenager told how she was subjected to ' harrowing ' violence and menaced with a gun to go through with the ceremony			2
file picture the judge added : ' the marriage was consummated about two weeks later , after further threats to her if she did not permit her husband to have sexual intercourse with her			0
' the girl ’s barrister , @entity96 , said : ' she is the victim of forced marriage and rape			2
she is 17 and struggling with the complexities of the two sets of legal proceedings that she is already involved in			0
' it is unrealistic to consider that she is presently equipped to proceed with a petition for nullity			0
' mr @entity0 accepted that - as the girl was ' domiciled ' in the @entity16 ; had been put under duress ; and , most importantly , was under 16 at the time of the ceremony - the marriage was ' on the balance of probability , void ' under @entity37 law			1
however , he said he was prevented from making a solemn declaration to that effect by a section of the @entity117 1986 , which states : ' no declaration may be made by any court ... that a marriage was at its inception void '			1
- barrister @entity96 if he were to grant the declaration sought by the local authority , the judge said he would ' frankly , be bypassing the statutory prohibition by a mere device			1
i can not do that and i am not prepared to do that '			0
he added : ' i do understand and have sympathy with the point and position that it might be particularly defiant by the girl of her family for herself to initiate proceedings for a decree of nullity , although she now has little contact with most members of her family			0
' the reality is that , sooner or later , she needs fully to resolve her legal status and to face up to the obviously necessary step of obtaining a decree of nullity			0
' that , however , is a matter for her own decision , her own timing , and her own choice			0
for the reasons that i have now given , i simply refuse to make the order sought			0
' the court earlier heard that the girl ’s ‘ husband ’ was not named on her baby ’s birth certificate and his whereabouts are unknown			0
however , he still has the rights of a ‘ putative or non-marital father ’ and could conceivably play a part in the care proceedings .			0
