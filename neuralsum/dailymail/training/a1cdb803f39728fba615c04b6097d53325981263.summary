@entity0 has accused @entity2 ’s supporters of pining for @entity3 and @entity4 and the ‘ kick and rush ’ football of @entity7 ’s team			1
the @entity2 finished seventh in consecutive seasons at the turn of the millennium with @entity3 and @entity4 forming one of the @entity15 ’s most feared strike partnerships			1
but on saturday @entity0 ’s side were booed off at half - time and at the end of a sour stalemate with @entity20 , in which @entity21 made his home debut and @entity23 was sent off			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 was bemused as to why his team were being booed during the @entity20 draw @entity21 ( left ) could not break the deadlock for @entity2 on his @entity27 return midfielder @entity23 ( right ) was sent - off for @entity2 in the second half the @entity29 , though , has some harsh words for the club ’s followers			1
‘ i understand the booing at the end and at half - time probably , but during the game when a team - mate passes the ball , i do n’t , ’ he said			1
‘ my message to them is patience			2
and i am sorry i ca n’t bring @entity4 and @entity3 back			2
i think they ( the fans ) are still living in the past			2
you can not live in the past			0
‘ on top of that , you have to remember how @entity7 left the club ( sacked in 2002 )			0
they forgot very quickly about what @entity7 achieved , and that is very unfair			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , says the high - tempo playing style employed by @entity7 is now redundant in the modern game			1
‘ i think it was kick and rush , ’ he said			0
‘ people think they were very good because of the way they played - it was excellent and worked perfectly for @entity4 and @entity3 in particular			2
‘ it is a way if playing and i respect it			0
i suffered myself here , 4 - 0 at half - time , but i do n’t think too many teams in the @entity15 play it now			1
’ @entity0 says fans want to see the team play in the way that was seen when @entity4 ( right ) was at the club @entity3 was @entity4 's strike partner and the duo are fondly remembered by @entity2 fans @entity7 ( left ) was the manager at the time but @entity0 wants his side to play with a different style @entity2 supporters may well argue that ‘ kick and rush ’ is better than the dross served up at the @entity78 this season , where they have won just once in the league			1
and @entity0 is concerned about the disconnect with those in the stands			1
‘ yes , it worries me , ’ he said			0
‘ it worries me a lot			0
‘ but it is up to me to find a solution to connect with the fans through better play , whatever that system is , whether through passing , or going long			2
it is up to me , i am responsible			0
‘ at the moment it is not nice to watch , i can understand that			0
all i can say is i promise you i will try to find a way to bring more excitement to the stadium			0

@entity0 concerned about the growing *discontent* from @entity2 fans
he wants supporters to show patience with what he is trying to achieve
there were boos throughout @entity2 's 0 - 0 @entity27 draw with @entity20
