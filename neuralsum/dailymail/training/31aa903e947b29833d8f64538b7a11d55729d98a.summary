by @entity0 every day , @entity1 , who works in marketing in @entity3 , would jokingly ask her boyfriend to tell her how much he loved her			2
so when @entity5 , 34 , a plasterer , decided to propose to ms @entity1 , 28 , he answered her question in an over-the - top way â€“ by covering her car in hundreds of post-it notes on which he had written : ' i love you this much '			1
mr @entity5 began the extravagant proposal by sending five bouquets of flowers , an hour apart , to ms @entity1 's office , each one bearing a one - word note , which combined to read : ' i love you this much '			1
i love you this much : @entity5 wrote a message of love on 1,500 post-it notes and covered his girlfriend 's car with them before proposing to her later that evening ' i thought , he 's either done something really wrong i 'm going to hear about it tonight , or there 'll be something waiting for me at home , ' she told @entity33			1
when she finished for the day , ms @entity1 walked to find her car covered in post-it notes			1
' i got back to my car and sort of spotted it from a distance and knew where i parked , but thought i definitely did n't leave it like that , i was a bit taken aback , ' she said			0
mr @entity5 had spent five hours writing ' i love you this much ' on 1,500 post-it notes and , with the help of two friends , spent an hour covering her car with the message			1
' we do n't have a secret fetish for post-it notes , ' mr @entity5 told @entity33			1
' it was just an over the top sort of thing			0
' ms @entity1 said she was touched by the extravagant gesture but ' then i thought : how am i going to drive home ? ' @entity5 said he never intended for his proposal to become public , but curious passersby took photos of the post-it - covered car and began an online search for the couple write caption here when she arrived at the @entity3 home they share , ms @entity1 found their front courtyard filled with 500 red and white balloons			1
' there was a sea of balloons to my waist , so i had to swim through them , ' she said			0
inside , she found tea candles arranged in a love heart , banners hanging through the house , her favourite chocolates and cocktails laid out for her , and instructions about where to find her boyfriend			0
' eventually i found him and he was standing there in his suit getting a bit emotional			0
he gave the big speech about how much he loves me , how it 's taken us a while but we got there , then he got down on one knee proposed			0
' ms @entity1 accepted and the couple , who got together 10 years ago with a few breaks , are planning to get married in february or march next year			2
the couple insist that they did not want a public proposal , but passersby were so intrigued by the post-it covered car that they took photos and an online campaign started to find out the story behind the car			2
' i was n't looking to do a huge display of affection , ' said mr @entity5			0
' in fact we only post-it - noted the window at 3.30 and she got to the car at 5.30 , so it was only two hours , but people took photos			0
' mr @entity5 had intended to propose while the couple were on holiday at a luxury resort in @entity115 , but decided against it , saying : ' i knew @entity1 would prefer something a bit more personal , because if i put more effort in , i thought that would mean more to her than just spending a lot of money			2
