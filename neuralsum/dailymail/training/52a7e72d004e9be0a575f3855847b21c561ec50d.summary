by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 17:47 est , 13 november 2013 my former sister - in - law 's ideas about bringing up children have never tallied with mine			1
i wo n't forget the morning @entity5 phoned me in a fury , asking : ' what do you think you were doing with my daughter ? she came home with alcohol on her breath			2
she says you bought her lobster for dinner			2
' ' i 'm her aunt , ' i replied defensively			0
' i thought it would be good for the growing - up process			1
' she refused to be mollified			0
lucky : @entity0 's nieces @entity18 and @entity20 ' but @entity20 is just 14 , ' she shrieked			1
' now she 'll want to go to expensive restaurants all the time			0
what do you think you 're doing ? it 's just too much ! ' but of course ! doing too much for our nieces and nephews is what we @entity30 - a new acronym devised by sociologists meaning professional aunts , @entity29 - do best			1
just like one in five women in @entity38 , i 've passed the age of 40 without having had children			1
combined with the fact that the nuclear family is splitting and reconfiguring itself into a bewildering number of shapes , @entity41 like me have come into their own			1
we are constant , indulgent and have bank accounts that have not been drained by the financial exigencies of bringing up children			0
moreover , we have a surplus of free time and maternal love to lavish on nieces and nephews			1
celebrity @entity41 such as actresses @entity56 and @entity58 , who are both childless , reiterate the mantra of @entity61 philosophy			1
says miss @entity56 , 41 , of her three nieces : ' i spoil them rotten			1
whatever they want , they get			0
i can not resist them			0
' it is no wonder we have become a source of irritation to mothers			0
@entity61 : @entity0 is a new kind of woman , the @entity75 , no kids in the universe of @entity79 , there are good @entity41 and naughty @entity80			1
since my two nieces , @entity18 and @entity20 , were born , i have been regarded by my former sister - in - law as an x ‑ rated @entity61			1
my brother @entity83 is much older than myself ( i am 42 and he is 60 ) and when my first niece , @entity18 , was born , i was only 18			0
she and her younger sister @entity20 , who was born two years later , tugged at my heart strings from the minute they entered the world			0
then , they were an unconscious substitute for the children yet to be born to me ; later , as the years passed , they became a symbol of the children i might not have			0
now , they are the closest thing to children i will ever get			0
throughout their lives , in order to win their affection , i have resorted to a tactic that is typical of @entity30 , and the bane of so many mothers ' lives : i have practised shameless one - upmanship			1
nevertheless , i was determined to be the adult female they 'd look forward to seeing at family events			0
while their mother scolded and performed the unpleasant tasks involved in raising children , i was keen to be a cross between a fairy godmother and a three ringed - circus ; a never - ending source of fun , gifts , holidays and introductions that would make their peers break out in hives of envy			1
when my nieces were four and six , i bought indoor fireworks to entertain them at @entity131 dinner at my then sister - in - law 's house in @entity134			1
the set cost £ 100			1
it contained miniature volcanoes , roman candles , spluttering snakes and exploding bombs			0
i shall never forget @entity5 's face as the fireworks and their explosive debris did their worst to her recently redecorated dining room			1
the children and i collapsed in giggles			0
my sister - in - law , who looked as if she had been turned into granite , pointedly called me a minicab			1
after that , family dinners were transferred to my father 's larger and more substantial house in @entity154 , where i continued my @entity156 ways			1
when the girls were 11 and 13 , i started to shower them with clothing from @entity159			0
' and where do you think they are going to wear that ? ' asked my sister - in - law			1
@entity20 , to my great pride , had just won a place at my alma mater , @entity167 's @entity166 in @entity134 , which had no uniform			2
' to school , ' i replied blithely			0
celebrity @entity41 : @entity56 and @entity58 , both childless , endorse the @entity61 philosophy			1
of her three nieces , @entity56 says , ' i spoil them rotten ' as the greatest @entity61 in @entity176 literature , @entity174 , says in the eponymous novel by @entity178 , which chronicles the adventures of a boy growing up in the care of his eccentric aunt : ' life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death			1
' @entity30 , on the other hand , promise indulgence , largesse - and delicious food			2
@entity174 , who was based on a real - life @entity61 , gets into trouble with her censorious relatives when she gives her 12 - year - old nephew waffles flambéed with champagne while lounging on a chaise longue in a low - cut evening dress			1
i have managed to top even that			0
i started my nieces on the bubbly when they were about the same age			2
i would sneak glasses of wine to them when i thought no one was looking			0
on the evening of their confirmation ( the girls were then 13 and 15 ) , i arrived at the church wearing a figure - hugging catsuit			2
at the dinner afterwards , in the private room of a sedate restaurant , my nieces , demure in their smart frocks , were encouraged by me to get wildly tipsy			2
we ended up wrestling on the floor			0
i am lucky enough to have a contacts book that includes the names of well - known people			2
when , a while ago , i told my nieces i was going to have breakfast with the handsome actor @entity223 at the @entity224 , they begged for signed photographs - which i gleefully provided			1
' the coolest @entity41 are often the maddest @entity41			1
' i engineered an introduction to musical impressario @entity227			0
four years ago i interviewed @entity228 and sneaked my 13 - year - old @entity230 - obsessed godson into the room			1
readers may look askance at these admissions , imagining that i was trying to buy the love i was unable to expend on my own , unborn children			0
in part , this has been true			0
not having children is an irrevocable sadness			0
i simply never met the right man at the right time			0
though i have been engaged twice , on both occasions i decided not to make the trip to the altar			0
so it is fair to say nieces and nephews can become child substitutes - and , in my case , expensive ones at that			1
according to a global marketing research firm , @entity41 are spoiling their nieces and nephews to the tune of £ 6 billion a year , a figure which does n't surprise me			1
one childless girlfriend of mine spent £ 10,000 in one year taking her 15 - year - old niece on luxury holidays to the @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 , knowing the child 's own mother could not afford expensive vacations abroad			1
such was her need to fill the childless void that , during these outings , she encouraged the girl to call her ' mummy '			2
this takes @entity270 too far			0
i have never attempted consciously to be a replacement mother to my nieces , or to alienate them from their own			2
grown - up : @entity18 ( pictured at her graduation ) and @entity20 have completed their education , but @entity0 's antics are still favourite subjects for their anecdotes while i 've loved taking @entity20 and @entity18 out for lobster dinners after school , or for £ 20 lychee martinis at trendy new bars , it has n't always been @entity286 pranks			1
i have also given advice on school work , helped them write essays and listened to accounts of their travails with young men , knowing they would speak freely to me in the way they could n't to their mother			0
children listen to @entity30 because they are the first grown - ups with whom they become friends			2
i have been frank with my nieces about sex , illegal substances and the difficulties young people today face			2
i have admitted that i once tried cocaine and that i found it a senseless , dangerous experience			0
i have told them what i know about the ways of men - and women - which , admittedly , is not very much judging by my chequered personal history			1
i have told them when i think they are getting too thin or , occasionally , overweight			0
but when a @entity286 criticises , the sting is softened by humour and a pretence of eccentricity			0
not that my nieces and godchildren believe the latter to be a pretence			2
for the coolest @entity41 are often the maddest @entity41			1
my nieces , now 22 and 24 , have completed their education and are starting out in professions			2
meanwhile , i continue on my headlong , scenery - chewing , unintentionally hilarious career - a favourite subject for their anecdotes			2
i 'm the living embodiment of a hoot , still dressed in a catsuit with a martini in one hand , a cheque in the other			0
were i ever to become a responsible grown - up in their eyes , i know i 'd be toppled from @entity344			2
panks are like @entity346 : they exist partly in the imagination and must never , ever turn into anything serious			0
my former sister - in - law once said to my mother : ' it 's amazing how well the girls have turned out , given the influence of your family			1
' i like to think it is my @entity357 that has contributed a little to their sense of humour , tolerance and generous hearts			0
i am ' @entity364 ' , and i can think of few more desirable titles - except perhaps that of ' @entity367 ' .			2

@entity0 is one of the 20 *%* of @entity38 women who are over 40 and childless
as a result , there 's a new kind of woman , professional aunts with no kids
@entity41 like @entity0 spoil their nieces and nephews rotten - to the tune of £ *6bn* a year
