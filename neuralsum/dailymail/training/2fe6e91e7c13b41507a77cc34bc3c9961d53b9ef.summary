when @entity1 was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the young age of 27 , she thought her life was over			1
but in her darkest hour , inspiration struck and she found a way of turning her adversity into advantage			0
following her cancer treatment , @entity1 launched a successful business ' @entity11 ' - a unique range of wedding footwear , which emerged out of the fashion sketches she drew while recovering in her hospital bed			1
over two years of treatment she sketched shoes in her notepad to keep from being bored			1
after being given the all - clear , she turned the designs into real shoes and now sells them through a new online business @entity1 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , says : ' i started doing sketches of wedding shoes with blue soles when i was halfway through my cancer treatment			1
' i had a hit a real low and was going through that whole " will i live or die ? " situation			0
' but i decided that i was going to pick myself up and fight this cancer			1
the sketches were my release and the way i got through the many hours spent in a hospital room			0
' it was incredible when i realized i could turn my footwear designs into a commercial business			1
' after being given the all - clear , i set up @entity44 and i 'm just so thrilled by how well the range has been received by customers			1
' @entity1 , 31 , was working as a marketing manager when she discovered a lump in her throat in 2010			1
she explains : ' i immediately went to see my gp who referred me to a specialist who did a number of tests			0
@entity1 was diagnosed with @entity55 thyroid cancer and had to undergo two operations to remove ta lump and part of the gland , resulting in a scar on her neck ( pictured ) ' a few months along the line , the lump on my throat had got bigger , so i had to undergo surgery to get it and a small part of my thyroid removed			1
' however when the results came back , they discovered that the lump was cancerous and i was diagnosed with @entity72 thyroid cancer			1
' when i received that diagnosis , i was just in a state of shock			0
i did n't know if the cancer had spread or what the future would hold for me			2
' following her diagnosis , @entity1 underwent a year - long intensive treatment which included two operations to have her thyroid gland removed , a course of hormone suppressants , further hospitalization and radiation treatment			1
she says : ' i had to take leave from work and i was in and out of hospital			0
mentally i was in a very dark place , sitting in my apartment day - after - day			2
@entity1 has designed all of her shoes with a distinctive blue sole , to integrate the ' something old , something new , something borrowed , something blue ' tradition ' i had no idea what was going to happen to me			1
but i knew i had to be positive if i was going to overcome this treatment			0
i told myself this was not going to be the end for me			0
i decided to channel my negative feelings and start drawing			0
' i had always loved fashion and when i was younger , i would sketch with my @entity103			0
' several of my friends were getting married at the time so weddings were very much in the air			0
so initially , i would be drawing designs for bridal gowns and other garments			2
' but then i started sketching wedding footwear - designing shoes with distinctive , blue soles which were super comfy too			1
i thought it would be a lovely way of integrating the ' something old , something new , something borrowed , something blue ' tradition			0
' drawing really helped me deal with my treatment			0
' but i also began looking at turning my sketches into commercial ideas and realised that i could make a living out of my bridal shoes			2
@entity1 now runs the business @entity11 ' from then on , every time i went to hospital , i took my sketch pad and laptop			1
i would immerse myself in my sketches and thrash out different business ideas			2
' @entity1 was given the all - clear in august 2011			1
with the encouragement of her entrepreneur boyfriend , @entity133 , she then turned her dreams into her reality and set up ' @entity136 '			2
each gorgeous shoe from the collection has a blue sole , incorporating the age - old tradition of what a bride should wear at her wedding for good luck			2
' my doctors were great			0
even though i will have to be on medication for the rest of my life , i feel so lucky to be alive today and running a business which i love			2
' i do n't know if i would be doing this today if i had n't gone through what i did			0
you never know where great ideas can come from and i hope i can inspire others			0
