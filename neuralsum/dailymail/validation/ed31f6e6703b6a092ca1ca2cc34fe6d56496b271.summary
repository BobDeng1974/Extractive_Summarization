toy giant @entity0 has come under fire from parents after publishing an article in its own - brand magazine which offered a range of ' insulting ' beauty tips to young girls			1
the march / april edition of the @entity9 included a feature called ' @entity11 ' , which suggested that young girls who are ' ready to change up their looks ' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape			1
' you , yes you , are beautiful , but if you 're ready to change up your look , read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face , ' the article reads			1
outrage : this ' beauty tips ' feature in the march / april edition of the @entity9 has caused fury among parents the feature then lists five different face shapes , from ' heart faces ' to ' oval faces ' , suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape			1
and while those with heart - shaped faces are advised to choose ' long , curly layers and thinned out curls ' in order to accentuate their ' angular cheeks ' , those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to ' have almost any style haircut ' because ' almost everything looks great on this face shape '			0
unsurprisingly , the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother , @entity54 - based writer @entity53 , writing a piece for the @entity56 slamming the magazine 's ' insulting ' feature			1
' [ my daughter ] is seven , ' she wrote			0
' my little girl , the shape of her face , and whether her haircut is flattering are none of @entity0 ’s concern , ' it was n’t even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it			1
' mrs @entity53 goes on to quote from the @entity71 website , which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are , she writes , ' far too young ' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to ' soften the edges ' of their faces			2
unnecessary : the ' overtly girly ' @entity71 line , including this @entity85 , has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional @entity0 models calling for change : writer @entity53 ( pictured ) wrote a piece about the @entity0 feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape the online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media , with parents across the country calling for @entity0 to abandon its ' sexist ' marketing campaigns and ' overtly girly ' toy ranges in favor of returning to the ' powerful messages ' it once offered to young girls who were so eager to play with their products			1
' go back to this [ message ] of 1981 instead of " beauty tips for 5 - 12 year - olds " c * * p , ' one person wrote on @entity115 , alongside a picture of a 30 - year - old @entity0 ad campaign which encouraged young girls to ' build for fun '			1
another added : ' @entity121			0
girls do n't need another source of beauty tips , let alone from you			2
' one parent went as far as to say she would boycott @entity0 until the brand does something to address its ' sexist ' campaigns , tweeting : ' @entity130 , your sexism is getting out of control			2
i ’m buying @ @entity135 blocks until you check it ( sic )			0
' ' the ultra-girly @entity71 line caused a flap from the beginning , and i was n’t at all sure whether i liked it , ' mrs @entity53 added			0
' why ca n’t girls and boys both play with traditional @entity0 ? when i was little , @entity0 used to even market them to all children , magnificently so ... ' go back : parents are calling for @entity0 to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls , such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981 fury : many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly ' sexist ' @entity71 line in a statement provided to @entity158 , @entity0 spokesman @entity156 insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by ' readers ' , adding that the brand ' sincerely regrets ' any offense caused by the feature			1
' @entity167 team is always striving for new ways to engage with @entity0 fans based on insights we gather from our @entity167 audience , ' mr @entity156 said			0
' one particular thing that readers asked us to include was an " @entity177 "			0
in the most recent magazine , we attempted to deliver against this request by elaborating on a current @entity71 story line			0
' we sincerely regret any disappointment it may have caused			0
we value this feedback and have already shared with the @entity9 team in order to positively impact future stories			2
' it is not the first time that the @entity71 line , the range of toys on which the beauty tips article was based , has come under heavy criticism from parents			2
shortly after the range debuted in 2011 , many people spoke out to express concern about its seemingly sexist suggestion that young girls needed their own line of feminine toys , rather than being able to play with the traditional building blocks also used by boys			1
instead of the more conventional themes many associate with @entity0 blocks , the @entity71 line focuses on shopping , beauty products , homemaking and cooking .			0

the march / april edition of the @entity9 included a feature on how young girls could change their *hairstyles* to be more flattering
parents are now threatening to boycott the toy brand over the ' *disgraceful* ' article
