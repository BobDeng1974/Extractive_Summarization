@entity5 , 18 , was sent abusive messages on social media sites @entity7 and @entity8 about her looks by pupils at her school over the course of two years from the age of 13 but with the help of her parents , @entity23 and @entity24 , she was finally placed in a school where she gained the grades to go to @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity5 , who has now nearly completed a health and social care course and wants to work as a pharmacist , believes the problem is only likely to get worse			1
it comes as a study found that social media bullying is now a bigger problem than email and text abuse			1
she said : ' i totally back calls that cyber bullies should face prosecution			1
they made my life miserable for years			2
the student was forced to twice change her account and spiralled into a depression which saw her contemplating suicide ' if they had done it to my face , they would have had to face the music but , because it was behind an online profile , they got away with it			1
i think the threat of prosecution might also act as a deterrent to anyone thinking of doing it			1
' @entity5 's ordeal started in 2009 when she was just 13			1
she said : ' i was in year eight			2
at the time @entity8 and @entity7 were all the rage and that 's where the bullying began			2
' people would send me vicious messages every day , really horrible comments about the way i looked			1
' they did n't like the fact i was speaking to another lad who was a friend of mine , so they 'd post comments saying i was doing sexual things with him , all of which were n't true			2
' every day there would be messages and , after a while , it stopped me going into school			1
i just could n't handle it any more			2
' she said she changed from a happy and sociable teenager into a recluse who would rarely come out of her room			2
she said : ' i kept thinking : " what 's the point ? " i thought it would n't matter if i was no longer here			0
' i did n't go out at weekends or socialise			0
i just stayed in my room			0
i got depressed and would sleep all the time			0
i went from being happy and bubbly to locking myself away in my room			0
when mum confronted me after about a month , i burst into tears and told her			0
it was such a relief to have someone on my side			0
' she said she believes it is too easy for a bully to attack people online because untraceable fake profiles are easy to create			0
she said : ' i think to have a profile you have to prove who you are and that you are a certain age			0
it 's too easy for 13 - year - olds to pretend they are 18			1
' what starts off with one or two bullies can quickly escalate into something too much for anyone to handle			1
' you can deal with two people , but not faceless @entity7 groups			0
i ended up shutting my @entity7 and @entity8 accounts for a long time until i was able to get over it			0
' in year 11 , when i began to make friends , i opened my @entity7 account but kept it private and only accepted people i like			1
i 'm careful with it now because it made my life hell			0
' but with the help of her parents , @entity23 ( pictured ) and @entity24 , she was finally placed in a school where she gained the grades to go to @entity27 , @entity28 the social media report , by @entity131 psychology lecturer dr @entity130 , studied 29 children aged 11 to 15			1
dr @entity130 said : ' increasing digitisation has led to growing concern over the effect this is having on the prevalence of cyberbullying and cyber victimisation			2
' dr @entity141 , clinical director for integrated commissioning at @entity143 , said : ' gps often only learn that a young patient is being bullied when it has been going on for some time and is having a negative impact on their health			0
' we are now seeing an increasing number of young people in who are struggling with mental health problems linked to bullying , including cyber-bullying			0
' @entity157 can undermine confidence and cause low self - esteem , anxiety and , in some cases , self - harm or depression			2
' i encourage any young people who are being bullied to speak to someone they trust , such as a parent , carer , or teacher , before their mental health begins to suffer			0
' a @entity171 spokesman said : ' bullying is serious and pupils and parents should be assured that they will be fully supported by their school when reporting incidents			0
