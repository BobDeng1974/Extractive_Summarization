they may look like the same thoughtful photographic portrait of @entity2 , but in fact one of these is a hyper - realistic finger - painting , created using only an @entity6			1
if you are still not convinced , the @entity10 artist responsible , @entity9 , 26 , has produced a video to accompany his painstaking work viewed by almost four million people on @entity15 - the only thing it is missing is a trademark narration by the @entity18 legend			1
the ultra-detailed picture , originally by photographer @entity19 took @entity9 one month and constitutes 285,000 finger strokes that blend ontop of one another to produced the precise wisps of hair in @entity2 's beard , the wrinkles in his forehead and the freckles on his cheeks - rendering it almost indistinguishable from the original image			1
scroll down for @entity33 painting or photograph ? the image on the left is the incredibly realistic @entity6 finger painting created and conceived by @entity9 using the photograph of @entity2 by @entity19 ( right ) , where @entity2 poses for a portrait backstage during the @entity42 at @entity43 on july 18 , 2009 in @entity44 in the time - lapse video which shows the humble beginnings of his piece , @entity9 reveals how he uses a specialist art app called @entity49 to allow him to zero - in and layer his work			1
@entity9 , who is a trained artist and oil painter used the app to reduce the brush sizes to only a few pixels - which in turn lets him zoom in to apply stroke upon stroke to produce the ultra-lifelike portrait			2
' it captures every brush stroke automatically and you can export it to the camera roll , ' @entity9 explained			0
' it has the best canvas size and and video export			0
it â€™s the most like @entity68			0
' beginnings : @entity9 's video shows how he painstakingly created the picture from scratch on his @entity6 using only his fingers and an advanced app called @entity49 the incredible detail of the work has led to some doubting whether the finger painting is all @entity9 claims it to be			1
critics have pointed out that apps like @entity49 allow the user to easily add on images or photos and set them as paintings			0
as such , some have attempted to claim that @entity9 's step - by - step video is in fact played backwards and is not a true representation of a life - like portrait of @entity2			1
however , @entity9 's portfolio of @entity6 work is extensive and includes pictures of @entity93 and @entity94 - all incredibly realistic			1
painting : the image of @entity2 is clearly coming together but is still a painting and not the hyper - realistic image that is indistinguishable from a photograph that @entity9 finally creates almost there : while at first glance the picture on the left could be mistaken for the real thing but the softness of the eyes and the tip of the nose are a giveaway			2
it is a lot hard to tell whether the picture on the right is a painting or the real thing @entity9 told ninemsn that the painting was a very long process			0
' i get very involved in my process so spend a lot of time each day on the painting , ' he said			0
' i was spending 9 - 10 hours some days if a certain area i was working on was complicated			0
' launchpad : this portrait of @entity94 was created by @entity9 in 2010 and quickly spread around the internet as an example of his talent with finger painting on the @entity6 , while ( right ) this image of @entity128 displays @entity9 's uncanny ability to produce intricate image using his @entity49 app inspired to create the picture after viewing @entity2 in the @entity134 vehicle , @entity135 , @entity9 has been using an @entity6 to paint since 2010			1
' i 've found with past videos people are more engaged when the subject is familiar to them , ' he said			0
' i think i must have been watching the movie @entity135 when the idea of @entity2 came to mind			0
' however , the portrait of @entity2 seems to be a quantum leap forward in terms of the final product for @entity9 , who lives in @entity146			2
evolution : @entity9 began his work on the @entity6 application known as @entity150 - and this portrait of @entity152 from 2011 illustrates his early skill - which has developed over the past two years as an early portrait of @entity155 from 2011 also shows beauty : @entity157 and her green eyes are the highlights of this portrait by @entity9 as the beehive of @entity162 in her prime reveals an artists touch inspired by the @entity6 art of legendary @entity10 artist , @entity166 , who used @entity168 's tablet to paint in 2010 , @entity9 originally used an app known as brushes , before updating to @entity49			1
the illustration and animation graduate first began creating digital art following the release of the @entity6 and was first recognized for his artwork after he posted his re-creation of the @entity178 poster on the @entity168 @entity180 website			2
even @entity168 - the creators of the @entity6 - were so impressed they invited him to give a speech at their @entity183 in @entity184 - just days after he posted the picture .			0
