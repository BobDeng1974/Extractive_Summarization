there is nothing more disappointing than a soggy salad when it comes to summertime lunching			0
but such unsatisfactory snacks could become a thing of the past as scientists have found a way to genetically extending the life of lettuce so leaves will stay fresh for more than a week			2
by looking at the lettuce ’s genetic make - up they are breeding selectively ‘ tougher ’ plants			1
no more soggy salad ! scientists have developed a way to genetically extend the life of lettuce so it stays crispy for up to eight days researchers from the @entity22 found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green , crisp and firm for longer			1
having made the observation , @entity27 , a professor in plant biology at the university worked out which genes are responsible for these characteristics			0
she is now working with @entity34 - one of the biggest producers of packaged salads - to selectively breed lettuces with these qualities			1
it means the leaves , which often wilt and turn brown after just a few days , will last at home for up to eight days			0
‘ people will know how frustrating it is to buy a bag of prepared salad only for it to wilt and turn into a brown mush after a few days			0
if you do n’t eat it quickly enough you end up being wasteful and throwing it away , ’ professor @entity27 said			0
@entity52 means fresh : researchers from the @entity22 found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green , crisp and firm for longer ‘ our research means growers will soon be supplying supermarkets with leaves that will last more than a week after you get them home			1
‘ that will allow families to do their weekly food shop and have a fresh salad on any day of the week			0
‘ our findings are also applicable to spinach and rocket leaves , which often come in the mixed leaf bags			0
however , they already tend to be more hardy			0
’ baby salad leaves , which are usually cos or lollo rossa , undergo rigorous processing – which includes harvesting , transportation , washing , sanitisation , removal of excess water , and packaging - before they reach supermarket shelves			2
putting the spring back in greens : one professor in plant biology worked out which genes are responsible for these crispy lettuce leaves			0
experimental specimens are pictured left and an experiment to test crispness is pictured right only the most robust leaves can survive this process without being bruised and damaged , which makes growing salad crops with ‘ processable ’ leaves extremely important for the packaged salad industry , as it reduces waste and increases shelf life			1
professor @entity27 found producers could also increase the shelf - life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent , which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly			1
‘ we were able to show if you reduce water use in intensive salad production by about 20 per cent , you actually develop smaller , tougher leaves with stiff cells walls , which is what we ’re interested in , ’ she said			1
cream of the crop ? professor @entity27 found producers could increase the shelf - life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent , which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly			1
a filed of selectively bred lettuces are pictured she said that the researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help @entity34 improve the quality of its products			2
professor @entity27 said there is a trade - off between taste , crispiness , and shelf - life ‘ because you want the leaves to be firm but not too hard			1
’ dr @entity131 , from @entity34 , said : ‘ the results open the door to exciting further studies across a wider range of crops and geographies to drive down the use of water while improving crop quality and shelf life			2
’ @entity141 redesigned : the researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help @entity34 improve the quality of its product			0

researchers from the @entity22 found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green and firm for longer
they *identified* the genes responsible and are breeding selectively ‘ tougher ’ plants that could stay crispy for up to eight days after purchase
scientists are working with @entity34 - one of the biggest producers of packaged salads - to selectively breed lettuces with these qualities
they also found that producers could also increase the shelf - life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent
