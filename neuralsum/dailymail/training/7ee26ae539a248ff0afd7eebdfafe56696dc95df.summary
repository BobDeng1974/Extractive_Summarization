they say lightning does n't strike twice but among some gullible @entity4 fans that phrase does n't appear to apply			2
a year ago @entity6 , managed to dupe some @entity8 supporters into believing that their club was linked with various players during the january transfer window - only for those names to be made @entity13 12 months on , the radio station has been at it again outside @entity14 - with the theme being of @entity17 characters this time around dubbed as ' @entity18 '			1
binks , a centre back or a left winger from the @entity44 , is described by one fan as the ' new @entity46 , ' while another says he will be a good signing on the flanks			0
@entity36 is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older ' brother ' @entity51 - the @entity53 and @entity54 international striker			2
unlike his 28 - year - old ' sibling ' though , @entity36 's main ' attributes ' are his ability to play as a target man			2
the 6ft 5in forward would be a welcome addition according to the @entity8 faithful and is seen as an ideal replacement for club legend @entity62			0
' @entity36 ' was seen by fans as an ideal replacement for club legend @entity62 ' @entity65 ' like @entity32 is another young prospect who can play both as a centre back or as a left winger @entity34 , like @entity32 , has the rare tactical flexibility to play in the heart of defence and or on the left flank - a trait that @entity4 supporters clearly feel would be a bonus commodity			1
the @entity80 star 's potential arrival is one relished by the west @entity82 faithful , although one fan believes he needs another season before he can make a real impact at the club			0
although the force is not with all @entity4 supporters , two were switched on to the prank			0
upon hearing of @entity89 a male duo state that they have ' never heard of him , ' before querying that the @entity44 prospect ' sounds like something out of @entity17			0
' the duo 's suspicions are confirmed upon hearing @entity34 's name but alas if only their fellow supporters were as clued up			0
the prank did n't fool these two @entity4 fans ( centre and right ) though who were wise to the made - up names luckily for them though there 's no pulling the wool the eyes over @entity40 's side at present it seems , as the @entity8 continue to fight on all four fronts for silverware this season			1
saturday 's 2 - 0 win at home to @entity117 saw the @entity8 move two points clear of title rivals @entity119 at the top of the @entity121			1
@entity4 travel to @entity123 next on saturday evening looking for their 16th win in 22 league games			1
@entity126 ( centre ) scored @entity4 's opener as they beat @entity117 2 - 0 in the @entity121 on saturday			1

@entity33 , @entity31 and @entity35 are all @entity17 characters
trio were called @entity32 , @entity36 and @entity34 in @entity6 prank
@entity4 beat @entity117 2 - 0 at home in the @entity121 on saturday
blues travel to @entity123 in their next league *fixture* on january 17
