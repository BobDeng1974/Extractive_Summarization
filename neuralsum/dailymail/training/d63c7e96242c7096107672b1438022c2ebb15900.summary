@entity1 8 @entity0 has expressed his sympathy for @entity4 rival @entity3 after he suffered a broken leg last week			1
@entity3 's injury , suffered during @entity8 's 24 - 23 win over @entity9 on january 9 , could pave the way for @entity0 to return to @entity4 's starting xv in time for the @entity11			1
the @entity13 - born back - rower was the first choice in that position heading into the autumn , but he was usurped by @entity3 after putting in a disappointing display against @entity18			1
@entity3 is likely to miss the entire @entity11 after the @entity8 forward broke a leg against @entity9 @entity0 is primed to reclaim his no 8 jersey for @entity4 's @entity11 opener against @entity22 in @entity23 and although the pair have been locked in a tense battle for months @entity0 , who scored a try for @entity9 in the clash at @entity26 , takes no joy out of @entity3 's current predicament			1
' i thought at the time it was a serious injury			0
i had a lot of sympathy for him and his mother , who i talk to quite a lot after @entity4 games			1
i hope he recovers well , ' he told the @entity39			0
' i do feel sorry for him as it has happened to me before , two years ago , when i got injured before the @entity43 game and in the @entity45 game			0
that is how life goes , how - people get opportunities and that is how i got mine when i first came through at @entity51			0
so yes , there is a degree of sympathy for him but i have to carry on			2
' @entity56 suffered the injury in a tackle involving @entity1 @entity59 last week his attitude speaks volumes for the team spirit head coach @entity62 has cultivated since taking over			0
but despite @entity3 's absence the @entity9 man is not totally guaranteed a starting berth , with @entity51 skipper @entity66 offering a versatile option and @entity69 ' @entity68 pushing hard for a recall after being in the international wilderness since 2011			1
another player who has spent years on the fringes and is now looking for a way back is @entity75			0
the @entity77 fly - half , who travelled with the squad to @entity80 last summer , has been in sparkling form for the @entity83 - based side this season			0
@entity3 was named @entity4 's player of the series after his superb display against @entity88 in november he gave a timely reminder of his talents , both with ball in hand and from the tee , as @entity77 stunned reigning @entity95 champions @entity94 20 - 7 last week			1
@entity75 's club team - mate and former @entity4 winger @entity96 told @entity98 that the former @entity51 man is overdue a recall			1
you want the best players in that team and the consistency that he has shown week in , week out for possibly 18 months now			0
i 'm not saying he should be starting for @entity4 , but he should certainly be in the squad , ' he said			2
@entity62 is due to announce his @entity4 squad for the @entity11 campaign next week			2
@entity3 celebrates with team - mate @entity113 after the latter scored a try on friday			2

@entity3 broke his leg during @entity8 's win over @entity9 last week
no 8 rival @entity0 could be elevated to @entity4 xv in @entity3 's place
but @entity0 has expressed his sympathy to the @entity8 back row
@entity0 said : ' i have a lot of sympathy for him and his mother '
