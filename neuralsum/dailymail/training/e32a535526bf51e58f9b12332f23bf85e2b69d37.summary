by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 19 february 2013 a little girl from @entity2 , @entity3 , has been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition which means her skins breaks into agonizing blisters at the slightest touch			1
@entity8 , 3 , has @entity9 or ' @entity10 ' where the skin is as fragile as an insect 's wing , 12 news @entity2 reports			1
it means ever since she was born her skin painfully blisters on being grazed - even through the comforting arms of her mom and dad			1
she ca n't be showered because of the pressure of falling water and wears layers of ointment and bandages around her legs - the worst affected parts of her body			1
changing her out of her diapers as a baby was a two person job - her parents told the website			2
one had to focus on holding her down and stopping her from wriggling so she did n't break her skin from the movement while the other removed the diaper gently with two hands to ensure it did n't tear her by sticking to her body			1
' there ’s nothing that i can do , as a mother , to make her pain go away , ' @entity55 told the local website			2
' you just hope that it ends quickly			2
but that kind of makes me feel like a failure as a mother , that i have this child that is in pain or gets hurt and i ca n’t protect her			2
' ' it ’s a horrible feeling as a parent			2
you feel totally out of control			2
' the incurable disease affects around 1 in 50,000 and can vary in severity with most cases at the very mild end of the scale , a much less serious illness than @entity8 's			1
blisters : 3 - year - old @entity8 has painful blisters on her body from her condition , particularly on her legs , pictured			1
they have to be constantly bandaged to protect them from every touch building a normal life : things are getting easier for @entity89 as she and the people around her learn to live with her condition on the other end some children are unable to eat solid food as their throats and tongues are affected with food tearing at their bodies from the inside			1
@entity8 is able to wear normal clothes but anything sharp like a zipper is strictly banned			1
her arms can go un-bandaged but are still sensitive and she often gets blisters on her face			1
her parents use ice packs to relieve the pain but are daily forced to pop large blisters that form across her body			1
her mother , @entity111 , 40 , a nurse said the diagnosis was heartbreaking			2
' i ca n’t possibly describe how i felt at the time , ' she told the website			2
' i thought my child had a death sentence			0
it was unthinkable to me			0
' her father @entity121 , a teacher , 49 , recalls looking up the disease when she was first diagnosed			0
' boy , was that a mistake , ' he said			0
the couple have developed a close relationship with their specialist dr @entity127			0
the head of dermatology at @entity131 discovered her condition by simply rubbing his pencil eraser on the remaining skin on her leg - soon it was tearing ' we had a number of very interesting conversations with dr. @entity127 very early on , ' @entity121 said			1
' what do we do with her ? do we put her in a bubble ? keep her safe ? or do we make her a normal kid and deal with the consequences '			0
the family were able to count their small blessings that their little girl was n't suffering from one of the very extreme types of the disease			0
her eating is n't affected so she can go to school so long as she , and everyone around her , is extremely careful			0
brave : the @entity157 pictured are fundraising to allow research into their daughter 's condition			1
they are hopeful a cure will be found tough : @entity8 changes her own bandages despite only being three although she ca n't get into the rough and tumble of the playground her parents want her to have as normal a life as possible			1
' i did n’t want to mummy her , keep her like a mummy , ' @entity111 said			0
and the gift of independence is helping			0
@entity8 now changes her own dressings and when asked about her condition in school has been known to reply - ' i 'm beautiful '			1
' she ’s very much a little captain			0
she ’s a very savvy little girl , ' dr @entity127 says			0
' but we kind of always tell ( @entity10 ) parents , like , this should be their computer kid			1
she ca n’t be the soccer kid , because she just ca n’t stand any kind of friction			0
it causes blisters every time she touches anything			1
' ' having said that , @entity8 will go off and kick a soccer ball			1
' she ’s going to be a rambunctious , active girl			0
but she pays for it			0
she pays for it with blisters			2
' the couple , meanwhile , fund - raise to try and help advance research into the disease and hopefully find a cure			0
' will it be five years from now , 10 years from now , 20 years from now ? we do n’t know , ' @entity121 said			0
' we know a cure is coming			0
we feel that in our hearts			0

brave @entity8 , 3 , is fighting painful condition @entity9 which means her skin blisters at every touch or graze
the illness dubbed ' @entity10 ' means she 's unable to shower or run around too *strenuously* in case she tears her skin
she wears bandages constantly on her legs and has to have her painful open wounds dressed every *day*
