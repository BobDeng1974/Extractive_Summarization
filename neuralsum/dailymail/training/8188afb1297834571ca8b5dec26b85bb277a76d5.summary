‘ i thought strokes only happened to elderly people , ' said @entity3 , who suffered a stroke waking up one cold december morning two years ago , @entity3 felt so weak that she could n’t get out of bed			1
‘ i eventually managed to slide out but i fell over because the whole of my left side felt weak , ’ says @entity3 , now 22			1
‘ i crawled to the bathroom , but i could n’t work out how to tear off the toilet paper			0
i just stared at it			0
’ it was 7.30 am and , convincing herself she was just overtired , she dragged herself back to bed and fell back to sleep			0
she woke 20 minutes later feeling fine and went to have a shower			0
‘ but when i got in , i could n’t figure out what the tap was for , ’ says @entity3 , who was then studying primary education at university in @entity18 , @entity19			1
alerted by the sound of @entity24 , her flatmate @entity22 ran in and found her on the floor , completely hysterical			0
‘ i thought i was shouting for @entity22 , but no words were coming out , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ @entity22 rang my mum , who works five minutes away as a practice nurse			0
' as soon as she arrived , she knew something was seriously wrong and took me straight to @entity31			0
’ in the car and waiting room , @entity3 continued to have odd episodes of struggling to get any words out and weakness , lasting a few minutes each			1
in fact , these episodes were transient ischaemic attacks , also known as mini strokes			2
these can be a sign a major stroke is about to occur — and @entity3 suffered a large stroke less than an hour after arriving at hospital , while sitting in the waiting room			1
‘ the left side of my face suddenly drooped , my left side was paralysed and i could n’t utter a word , ’ she recalls			0
brain scans confirmed a stroke , and that her brain showed an area of dead matter , but @entity3 was surprised to learn of the diagnosis			1
‘ i thought strokes only happened to elderly people			2
in fact , strokes are becoming more commonplace among the young — and women especially may have additional risk factors that increase their chance of having one			1
strokes occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted , and there can be various causes for this			1
the most common is an ischaemic stroke , which is responsible for 85 per cent of cases and occurs as a result of a blood clot or clump of fat blocking a blood vessel in the brain			1
another example is a haemorrhagic stroke that is caused by a bleed in the brain			1
about 152,000 strokes happen in the @entity81 a year			1
some 30,000 women a year in @entity83 and @entity19 die as a result of a stroke — three times the number who die from breast cancer			1
for men and women , strokes are most common in over- 55s , but disturbingly the number of under - 55s having a stroke is on the rise			1
in @entity83 , the number of cases rose from 9,321 in 1998 to 16,415 in 2010			1
having a high salt intake is the single biggest risk factor for stroke because it increases blood pressure and causes artery walls to harden and narrow — making a blood clot more likely			2
smoking , being overweight and drinking excessive amounts of alcohol are also stroke risks because they , too , increase blood pressure			1
high - fat foods are also a problem as they can lead to the build - up of fatty plaques in your arteries			2
and a high - sugar diet can also increase your stroke risk , says professor @entity109			2
sugar damages the arteries and can lead to diabetes , which leads to raised blood sugar levels			2
these can trigger fatty deposits or clots on the insides of the blood vessel walls			2
yet women have other risk factors too			0
doctors suspected that @entity3 ’s stroke was brought on as a result of being on the combined pill ( which contains both oestrogen and progestogen )			1
this , along with pregnancy and taking hormone replacement therapy ( @entity157 ) , can increase women ’s chances of having a stroke because they raise risk of clots and high blood pressure			1
‘ @entity168 can increase the likelihood of the blood clotting and this may increase your risk of ischaemic stroke , ’ says dr @entity165 , deputy director of research at the @entity167			1
in 2000 , a large analysis of research studies published in the medical journal @entity178 found that there was an increased risk of stroke associated with taking the contraceptive pill , although pills that contain smaller amounts of oestrogen had less of a risk			2
and in february , the @entity187 reported how women taking so - called ‘ third generation ’ contraceptive pills , such as @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 , were nearly twice as likely to develop blood clots that can trigger strokes as those on older varieties and six times more likely than women on no pills at all			1
it ’s thought that it is the particular types of synthetic oestrogen these newer pills contain , such as gestodene , desogestrel , drospirenone , etonogestrel and norelgestromin — that increase the risk			0
however , these contraceptives are popular because they have fewer side - effects than traditional forms			0
‘ the risk of stroke caused by the contraceptive pill is low , but it ’s higher if you have other risk factors , ’ says dr @entity165			0
the combined pill should be used with caution if you have any of the following risks and not used at all if two or more apply : you ’re a smoker or stopped less than a year ago ; you have high blood pressure ; you ’re over 35 and a smoker ; you have a family member who has had a blood clot under 45 ; you ’re overweight ; you ’ve had a clot or stroke in the past ; you have diabetes with complications ; you have migraines			1
@entity3 had none of these			2
‘ i knew the @entity237 increased risk of blood clots , but not stroke , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ i came off it immediately after my stroke and now use a coil			0
’ despite the extra stroke risks for women ( men have an overall higher risk of stroke , but women have more risk factors ) , a recent poll from the @entity167 found one in eight women are unaware that they could suffer a stroke			2
the charity described the finding as ‘ extremely worrying ’ and adds : ‘ this should serve as a wake - up call to women of all ages to be aware of the steps they can take to reduce their stroke risk ’			2
after her stroke , @entity3 stayed in hospital for a week and was put on an anti-coagulant , which reduces the likelihood of a clot forming , and a statin , which lowers cholesterol			1
‘ after a few days , i could walk slowly to the toilet with help			0
' i started speaking after the stroke , but very slowly and i struggled with certain words , like please and thank you			0
' i could see them in my head , but just could n’t get them out			0
‘ my left side was still very weak and i could n’t wash myself , so @entity279 did it for me			0
’ she set her mind to getting better quickly and , six weeks after her stroke , returned to university to study , while continuing to have physio			0
six months later , @entity3 collected her degree — on time — while her proud parents wept in the audience			2
for men and women , strokes are most common in over- 55s , but disturbingly the number of under - 55s having a stroke is on the rise ( file picture ) she is now studying to become a primary school teacher , but tires easily ; her left side is also a little weaker — ‘ i always carry my shopping with my right hand , ’ she says — and she struggles to find the right words when she ’s tired			1
yet she ’s grateful she had a stroke			0
‘ it ’s made me so much more determined to succeed , ’ she explains			0
@entity3 ’s story underlines the fact that stroke symptoms should never be ignored , regardless of age			1
a 2013 study found that women arrived at hospital , on average , 27 minutes later than men , but minutes can make a difference for getting the best treatment			0
‘ do n’t wait until later , tomorrow or next week if you notice symptoms — it could be too late , ’ says professor @entity109			0
‘ and pay attention to what others say , as you may not always feel a stroke or mini-stroke symptom yourself			0
‘ for example , if a friend comments that your face drooped for a few seconds , do n’t ignore it			0
' you may not have felt it , but it could be a sign of an impending stroke			0

@entity3 , now 22 , suffered a large stroke two years ago
strokes occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted
some 30,000 women a year in @entity83 and @entity19 die as a result of a stroke
rise *attributed* to an increase in eating salty , fatty foods and obesity
