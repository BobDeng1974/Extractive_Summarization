' i feel like i 'm in @entity79 , turning up for dinner in the grand hall in my robes and having beautiful three course meals			1
i 'm still getting used to which way to lean when they serve you			0
' i ca n't tell you the amount of times i 've had to @entity91 etiquette			0
not because i necessarily want to change to be @entity10 but more because i do n't want to horribly embarrass myself or be rude to the host			0
' it 's been a steep learning curve but so much fun			2
the @entity10 just have so many forks but i love all the history			0

now , when she is n't attending tutorials and lectures , @entity14 is writing her @entity19 tales alongside her pictures , in what she describes as a ' new kind of memoir '			1
the student blogs about her life with friends on campus and documents twee weekends spent with them in the country			0
@entity14 gives readers a glimpse into the life of students behind the exclusive college walls - drinking on the college lawns , revising on the ' backs of @entity157 ' , attending garden parties and dancing at @entity36			1
@entity14 captures a piece of iconic @entity19 bloom as she and her friends sneak into the annual @entity163 garden party the student blogs about her life with friends ( @entity165 , @entity45 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 ) on campus and documents twee weekends spent with them in the country @entity14 , seen attending a formal dinner with friends @entity175 and @entity176 at @entity177 , @entity178 , admits there are elements of our aristocratic traditions , which would n't wash in all - american @entity15 @entity14 , pictured punting with friend @entity184 , loves the @entity10 accent and says even when she ca n't understand what 's going on around her , there 's nowhere else she 'd rather be and she marvels at events like @entity190 's ' @entity189 ' in the @entity191 , a race where students down copious amounts of port before attempting to run around the square before the grand clock strikes twelve			1
at times baffled by quirky @entity199 , @entity14 admits there are elements of our aristocratic traditions that would n't wash in @entity202 @entity15			1
she said : ' the @entity199 are so different from the @entity7 - i 'm sure they think i 'm crazy but unlike @entity15 they are too polite to tell you			1
' american college students like to drink shots at @entity208 but here they like to drink three types of wine at dinner			0
' i got my room by chance but in the @entity51 they would find the fact that sometimes they assign rooms on test scores baffling - the idea that you get a better room based on grade just would n't happen in @entity15			1
' only certain people of a certain status can walk on the lawns - i think if i did n't write my blog or take photographs , my @entity7 friends just would n't believe that these things happen			2
' it 's archaic and almost medieval sometimes			2
i do think it 's snobby , and slightly ridiculous but in an incredibly endearing @entity10 way and i find the old traditions just mesmerising			1
' @entity14 jokes that she came to study in @entity233 to avoid the ' math ' requirement set on college applications in the @entity51			1
but when she is n't attending lectures in beautiful ' castle - like buildings ' , @entity14 makes sure her social calendar is full to the brim , and she is currently working hard to blow off steam after exams and essays for the notorious ' @entity243 ' - a week of parties and balls after the exam period at the end of the academic year			1
when she is n't attending lectures in beautiful ' castle - like buildings ' , @entity14 , seen in her dorm , makes sure her social calendar is full to the brim @entity14 spends her weekends exploring the colleges and is amused by the ' no walking on the lawns ' rules @entity14 says life at @entity19 is ' just a totally different type of glamour ' adding : ' it is another world ' ' @entity243 is such an amazing week , everyone was already talking about it when i arrived in october , so i was worried it would n't live up to the hype , ' she said			1
' but then @entity243 came and it was fabulous			0
i had to sell a kidney to pay for all the balls , ' she joked , ' but it was totally worth it			0
' she continued : ' tickets vary from £ 90 going all the way up to £ 250 for certain balls , which are white tie and only happen every three years			0
' i do n't think @entity7 even really know what white tie is			0
i certainly did n't when i first came here			0
it 's just a totally different type of glamour , it is another world			2
' @entity7 does a lot of things well : hot dogs , obesity and fun - but we do n't do glamour like the @entity199			2
' i went to @entity284 last year			0
it is held in the most stunning setting , the girls all look beautiful and the men look like they 're from a @entity290 period drama			0

she added : ' summer in @entity19 is magical			0
after exams , students punt to a nearby village called @entity316 where the picnics range from bucolic and stress - reducing to rowdy and @entity320 - fuelled			2
' last term , when we accidentally stole a punt , we ended up getting horribly drunk and abandoning ship			0
' the next morning we got up early and hungover to return it before anybody noticed it was missing			0
' @entity14 is currently in the process of writing her book , a collection of funny essays and pictures about her escapades , which will be released in 2016			1
other anecdotes include the evening she and her boyfriend got trapped in the @entity336 overnight and when she was featured in @entity338 magazine because of her ' rather inappropriate hunting attire '			0
but her absolute favourite thing about @entity19 ? the @entity10 accent			0
' i definitely grew up with the @entity344 tropes of the @entity7 girl who meets the dashing @entity347 boy , ' she gushed			0
' i want to clarify that i am not one of those tragically old - fashioned girls who goes to college only to find a husband			2
