@entity0 is facing a battle to hold off @entity2 in his own back yard today – as voters go to the polls in @entity6 to elect a new police commissioner			1
a defeat for @entity9 would be seen as a major blow for mr @entity0 whose @entity12 constituency lies in the @entity6 police force area			1
today ’s contest was sparked by the resignation of @entity9 ’s previous police commissioner @entity16 – who stood down in the wake of the @entity19 child sex abuse scandal , where an estimated 1,400 children were abused over 16 years by @entity22 gangs			1
labour leader @entity0 is facing a fight to hold off the growing @entity2 threat in the party 's heartlands @entity2 has exploited the child abuse scandal to attack @entity9			1
last week , the party launched a poster featuring a young woman with the slogan : ‘ there are 1,400 reasons why you should not trust @entity9 again ’			2
@entity35 told @entity36 the election was be close – despite his party finishing a distant fourth in the 2012 contest			0
he said : ‘ it will be nip and tuck			0
we definitely feel that if we win this it will add fuel to the fire that from @entity47 northwards , if you vote @entity49 you get @entity9			2
’ mr @entity35 hopes it can keep its current momentum going by securing the @entity53 post following its recent by - election success in @entity56			0
voters are going to the polls across the @entity59 , @entity19 , @entity60 and @entity12 - but the turnout is expected to barely top 10 per cent amid widespread disinterest			1
@entity2 ’s candidate for the position is the retired police officer @entity63			0
@entity9 has chosen retired @entity66 priest @entity65 as its candidate – in a bid to distance itself from the @entity19 scandal			1
a lone voter enters an empty polling station on @entity72 , @entity19 today , which had seen only nine voters by 10.30am an empty polling station in @entity75 , @entity19 today , which had seen less than five voters by 10.30am an empty mobile library being used as a polling station on @entity79 , @entity19 today , which had seen only two voters by 11am there will be almost as much interest in how many of the 1,010,599 electorate bother to cast their votes as there will be on which of the four candidates wins when the by - election result is announced in @entity60 tomorrow			2
mr @entity16 's initial refusal to step down highlighted the fact that there was no way to get rid of a @entity94 unless they had committed an offence			1
the saga surrounding his future further undermined confidence in the new @entity94 system , which had been dented first by the record low turnouts in 2012 , and provoked furious calls for the law to be changed or the post to be simply abolished			0
the @entity106 have branded the coalition experiment with directly - elected commissioners a failure and pledged to scrap them			2
the party decided not to field a candidate in the by - election for this reason @entity9 has declared it is committed to scrapping them if it wins power in 2015			1
@entity2 leader @entity35 with the party 's candidate for the position of @entity6 police and crime commissioner @entity63 ( right ) mr @entity16 only resigned after weeks of pressure following the @entity124 which revealed how more than 1,400 children had been exploited by gangs of men in @entity19			1
he was the councillor who oversaw children 's services in the town between 2005 and 2010			0
but @entity9 's campaign to retain the post has been hampered by the controversy in @entity19			1
mr @entity35 has insisted @entity2 can build the party 's recent by - election victory in @entity56 and close second in @entity137 and @entity138 by getting its first @entity94 elected			0
and his confidence has also been supported by strong @entity2 showings in @entity19 's council elections this year and in the @entity143 elections in parts of @entity6			2
but @entity2 only came fourth when mr @entity16 was elected in 2012			1
the @entity145 , came second two years ago and they believe they will still be the biggest rivals to labour today 's poll			0
former police officer @entity63 hopes to replace former @entity9 police commissioner @entity16 who stood down in the wake of @entity19 child sexual exploitation scandal @entity2 has exploited the @entity19 child abuse scandal - where 1,400 children were abused - to attack @entity9 @entity152 @entity151 chairman @entity150 said his party has a high profile in @entity6 in the wake of it winning the @entity12 mayoral election in 2009 and pushing @entity9 hard in 2012			1
four candidates have declared for the by - election : @entity160 ( @entity152 @entity145 ) , @entity65 ( @entity9 ) , @entity63 ( @entity2 ) , @entity161 ( conservatives )			2
mr @entity160 came second to mr @entity16 in the 2012 election			1
