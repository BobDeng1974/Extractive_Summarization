plans that could see treated sewage water be introduced into @entity3 's drinking supply have been backed by two in three people			1
last year @entity5 launched a consultation to look at how they could increase the amount of water they would need in the future as the population increases			1
one of the options to ensure the @entity5 area has enough water to go around was to look at schemes such as waste water recycling			2
last year @entity5 launched a consultation to ask customers their thoughts on seeing waste water treated and put back into the mains supply ( file picture ) this would see waste from toilets recycled back into the @entity26 , drawn out and treated again to make it safe to go into the mains supply , to flow out from kitchen taps , which is common practice around the world			1
and the survey showed that 69 per cent of the people who responded to the section ' making sure there 's enough water to go round ' supported the idea of recycling waste water as ' the right plan to follow '			1
this is despite some customers voicing their concerns about the option of treated sewage being in drinking supplies			2
the company has already set up a test plant in @entity47 , north @entity3 , which is experimenting with the toilet waste recycling method			0
the survey showed that 69 per cent of people agreed that @entity5 should look into waste water recycling ( file picture ) however , a @entity5 spokesman said there are no definite plans as yet to implement the scheme			1
the scheme could see waste water from toilets recycled back into the @entity26 , drawn out and treated again to make it safe to go drink he said : ' this waste water re-use we are asking for our customers views on is not something we are planning to implement any time soon			1
' this is something we see as a longer - term measure and if implemented at all it would be in 2025			0
' the survey was prompted after estimates that the population of @entity3 and the @entity74 could move towards ten million people			0
the firm say that unless action is taken , there could be a water deficit of around 125 million litres per day by next year			0
other options people backed were installing water meters in homes and businesses as well as bringing in water from other parts of the country at times of drought			0
today , a @entity5 spokesman added : ' in summer 2013 , we published our draft proposals for how we will maintain and improve the services we provide to our customers for the five years from 2015 to 2020			2
' our draft five - year plan provides a summary of the work we believe is required between 2015 and 2020 to ensure we continue to provide high - quality water and sewerage services across @entity3 and the @entity74			0
' we held an eight - week consultation and spoke to over 5,000 people at 22 road show events across our supply area , encouraging them give us their views and discussing our plans			2
' over 2,700 customers visited our ' have your say ' website , and nearly 400 of them used our interactive tool to see how the proposals could affect bills			0
