a mother whose son suffered severe brain damage during birth is set to receive potentially the biggest medical negligence payout in history			1
the @entity6 ruled today that @entity7 must pay in excess of £ 14.6 million for birth injuries , after failing to carry out a caesarean section on @entity11 and properly monitor her during labour			1
the hospital 's negligence led to her son @entity15 , now 12 , being born with cerebral palsy			1
the decision , believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court - ordered award for birth injury , reflects the lifetime care that @entity15 needs			1
@entity11 ' son @entity15 was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour @entity32 can not speak , dress or feed himself ( without assistance of a machine ) and must use a wheelchair			1
his intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye - gaze equipment			0
he will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life			0
while the exact sum has yet to be confirmed , @entity46 understands the minimum payout will be £ 14.6m			0
to date , the biggest medical negligence payout has been around £ 15 million - and ms @entity51 's lawyers hope to exceed this amount			0
ms @entity11 was in labour when she was admitted to @entity54 in 2002			2
although her baby 's heart was monitored after her arrival , midwives either ignored or could not interpret the @entity60 trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly			0
@entity15 had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and mrs @entity11 was exhausted by a prolonged labour			1
today , the @entity6 ruled that @entity7 must pay ms @entity11 in excess of £ 14.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court - ordered award for birth injury @entity15 , now 12 , can not speak , dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair			1
he will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life the confusion about @entity60 interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely @entity81 section meant there was a delay in delivering @entity15			1
resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the @entity86			0
the sum ordered by the @entity6 includes money to pay for all @entity15 ’ needs including : * 24 hour care provided by a team of live - in carers			1
* significant modifications to his home to allow @entity15 to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom , kitchen etc. * hoisting and tracking equipment to lift @entity15 in and out of wheelchairs / bed			2
* therapists including physiotherapist , speech & language therapist , occupational therapist , aac therapist , orthotist , orthoptist , psychologist			0
* adapted vehicle to enable @entity15 to travel in his wheelchair			2
* sophisticated eye - gaze equipment to enable @entity15 to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work			1
* @entity117 ’ additional educational needs			0
ms @entity11 ' lawyer , @entity118 , a partner with law firm @entity119 , argued that had the caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby ’s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that @entity15 was in distress			1
in either event , he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury			0
ms @entity118 said : ‘ this is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries			0
' @entity15 is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life @entity15 could have had if he had not been injured			2
’ the @entity7 finally admitted liability for @entity15 ’s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth			1
however it took a further six years to fight for damages for @entity15			2
speaking today , ms @entity11 said : ‘ the family has been through a very difficult time			2
' [ the situation ] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and i am still on medication for depression and anxiety			0
' it was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives			0
' the award will help @entity15 realise his potential			1
' but no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others			0
' @entity169 , acting chief nurse at @entity7 , said : ' @entity170 and the @entity171 are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon @entity15 and his family			1
' @entity170 accepted , in 2009 , liability for the injuries which @entity15 sustained during his birth some 12 years ago			2
' although we can not turn back the clock , we hope that the compensation , once agreed , will provide the reassurance that @entity15 ’ future care needs will be met			0

@entity11 ' son @entity15 was *starved* of *oxygen* and has cerebral palsy
staff ' failed to monitor her properly or *perform* a caesarean section '
