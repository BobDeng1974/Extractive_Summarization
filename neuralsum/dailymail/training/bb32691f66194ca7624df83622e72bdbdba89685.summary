@entity0 , 21 , of @entity1 , @entity2 , has been told that her daughter @entity3 , right , can not attend her local primary school - even though she only lives 100yds from the school gates a mother has hit out after her daughter was rejected for a place at their local school - despite living just 100 yards away			1
furious @entity0 , 21 , put daughter @entity3 's name down for a place at @entity15 in @entity1 , @entity2 , when she was just three months old			1
the mother - of - two and her partner @entity17 , 25 , even moved into their house three years ago because they knew it was a two - minute walk from their desired school			1
but despite the fact they can hear schoolchildren in @entity28 's playground from their bungalow , @entity3 , now three , has been refused a place along with her friends to start in september this year instead , the family has been asked to send @entity3 to a different school - 20 minutes away by car			1
the full - time - mother , who also has a one - year - old called @entity37 , says she has not been given a reason for the refusal			1
she said : ' all of her friends from playschool , which is close by , have been given a place			0
' we 've always told @entity3 that she 'd go to @entity44 with her friends - and i do n't know how to tell her it 's not going to happen			2
' not only is it the closest school to our house , but it 's a very , very good school - i 'm so frustrated by it all			2
' i know of people who are exactly the same as @entity3 - the only box they tick is living close by , they do n't have any siblings at the school - but they 've been given a place			1
it 's not fair on @entity3			0
ms @entity0 registered her interest in her @entity3 attending the school formally when the youngster was just three - months old , because she knew places were sought - after			1
a few months later , @entity0 and her windscreen technician partner were looking for a house - and found one just round the corner from the school			1
in november last year , she painstakingly completed the online registration form to apply for a place at @entity15			2
' the criteria they use for allocating schools are - firstly , priority goes to children with disabilities or looked - after children			0
secondly , if there are any siblings at the school , then they consider living distance from the school and then if there are any spaces left they are allocated , ' she said			0
@entity15 , pictured , in @entity1 , @entity2 is just 100 yards from @entity0 's home - yet she has been refused a place in september an arrow shows the 100 yards @entity3 and her parents would have to walk to reach @entity15 from their home - instead they have been asked to drive 20 minutes away ' there are around 60 places available a year , and we 've been told this is a high - birth year so places are even more competitive			1
' ' after applying , the next thing i knew was when they contacted me saying they had two different addresses registered for me - the other was my parents ' address , so i assume they had that from when i registered interest when we were still living with my mum and dad			0
' i had to send them proof we lived at this house , which i did , and did n't hear anything back so assumed it was all ok			0
' but the next thing we knew , in april i logged onto the website where you apply , and it said " not accepted " next to @entity115			0
' it also said " not accepted " next to our second choice of school , and said " place given to @entity120 "			0
a short walk : if @entity3 had been given a place at @entity15 in @entity1 , pictured in the background , it would have been a two minute stroll			1
instead her mother @entity0 has been asked to drive 20 minutes to a different school ' @entity127 is n't even a school i put down as a choice			1
it may seem like it 's close by on a map but there 's no direct route , driving there round all the streets would take about 20 minutes			2
it definitely is too far to walk			0
' ms @entity0 was offered a two - tier application process including reallocation , which means if anyone turns down their place at the school , @entity3 could have it			1
however despite applying for this , the family found out this week that they had been unsuccessful			0
now they will have to try the second appeal process - applying to an independent panel who could allocate a place			0
' the appeal panel is in august some time - so what happens if @entity3 still does n't get a place ? i 'm not sending her to the school they allocated her at , it 's too far away			2
' i face keeping her off school until she 's five , and in the meantime will face all sorts of childcare issues , including paying for nursery			0
@entity0 says she has not yet been given a reason as to why her daughter @entity3 will not be able to attend @entity15 , 100 yards from her house ' but i 'm going to keep fighting this , because it 's ridiculous she ca n't go to this school when it 's so close to our house			1
' i have n't told her about it because she would n't understand why she ca n't go to school with her friends , but i 'll have to tell her eventually and she 's going to be so upset			0
' @entity174 , @entity175 's head of commissioning and partnerships , said : ' every effort is made by @entity175 to offer parents a place for their child at their preferred school , although this is not always possible where schools are popular and oversubscribed			0
' if none of a parents ' preferences can be met , a place will be offered at the closest school to the family home where a vacancy exists			2
