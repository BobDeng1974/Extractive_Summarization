@entity8 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , was disappointed at having to pay for postage and the seller , @entity13 - based @entity12 , its first negative feedback			1
now the firm , which is believed to sell medical supplies entirely though the internet auction site , is claiming her criticism may damage their business - even though it is true - and is suing ms @entity8 for defamation			1
@entity3 feedback : ms @entity8 ' seemingly innocuous comment sparked a lawsuit from @entity13 - based firm , @entity12 the row began in february when ms @entity8 bought a microscope light source for $ 175 , plus $ 12 shipping costs , from @entity28 , which trades on @entity3 as med_express_sales			1
when the package arrived with postage due of around $ 1.40 , ms @entity8 paid it but then went onto @entity3 and gave @entity12 a negative rating			1
she wrote : ' order arrived with postage due with no communication from seller beforehand			0
' according to @entity39 , @entity12 offered to refund her the extra charge , and asked her to remove her negative comment			0
ms @entity8 refused , because her comment was correct and because she was more annoyed by the inconvenience of having to pay extra postage than the amount itself			2
at this point @entity12 , which has its headquarters in @entity48 , @entity13 , and which has only one negative review compared to around 140 positive reviews in the last six months , sued			2

' she indicated that she would have been willing to pay $ 1.40 more in shipping up front , but that she was posting feedback because a company that ships products ought to be able to do a better job			0
