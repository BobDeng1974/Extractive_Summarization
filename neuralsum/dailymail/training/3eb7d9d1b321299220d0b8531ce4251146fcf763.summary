perhaps it was nerves before being serenaded by cross-dressing @entity3 singer @entity2 , but @entity6 chief @entity5 today fell into the trap of confusing @entity8 with @entity9 during a visit to @entity11			1
' i thank in particular ( @entity8 ) president ( @entity14 ) @entity15 and the government of @entity9 , ' @entity5 told reporters at a @entity6 conference of developing landlocked countries hosted by the @entity8 capital			1
he later corrected himself and apologised in the news conference , saying : ' there are no kangaroos in @entity8			2
sometimes this happens , i hope you understand			0
' @entity6 general secretary ban ki - moon ( left ) and @entity8 transvestite singer @entity2 pose at the @entity6 headquarters in @entity11			1
ki - moon today confused @entity8 with @entity9 during a speech later , @entity2 raised the roof for @entity5 and several hundred @entity6 staff , belting out @entity33 's ' believe ' and ' @entity34 ' , the song the bearded drag queen sang to win the @entity3 earlier this year			1
@entity2 has used her @entity3 fame to promote a message of tolerance , with performances in front of the @entity42 and at @entity43 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) events around @entity48			1
@entity5 paid tribute to her efforts , saying : ' i will continue to fight against transphobia and homophobia			0
i will stand strong for equality			0
i hope more of you join our global ' free and @entity59 ' campaign			0
' in an ankle - length blue dress and black high heels , @entity2 , 25 , said to cheers : ' i dream of a future where we wo n't have to talk about sexual orientation , the colour of your skin , your religious beliefs			0
' @entity2 raised the roof for @entity5 and several hundred @entity6 staff , belting out @entity33 's ' believe ' and ' @entity34 ' , the song the bearded drag queen sang to win the @entity3 this week 's @entity6 conference of landlocked developing countries brings together 32 nations with a combined population of 450 million people looking at improving transportation networks and access to markets			1

neither attended @entity2 's performance			2
@entity2 , whose real name is @entity2 , won the 2014 song contest for @entity8 in may			1
@entity5 said she had turned the event , often derided for its kitsch performances , into a ' moment of human rights education ' fighting for diversity and tolerance			0
@entity2 returned home to a heroine 's welcome after her song contest victory before a tv audience of about 180 million in 45 countries			2
at the time , she said : ' i share the opinion that this was not a victory just for me but for the people who believe in a future that works without discrimination and is based on tolerance and respect			0
' but her victory was condemned by some social conservatives as promoting gay rights			1
a confidant of @entity118 president @entity117 accused the @entity119 of trying to impose decadent values on other countries , saying @entity2 symbolised its ' ethno - fascism ' .			2

the @entity125 made the gaffe when thanking the nation 's president
he later drew *laughs* with apology : ' there are no kangaroos in @entity8 '
also *praised* @entity3 winner @entity2 for gay rights campaigning
