by @entity0 a third premature baby has died after being fed using a contaminated hospital feed drip			1
the infant was given a tainted batch of a fluid called total parenteral nutrition ( @entity7 ) at @entity9 's @entity8 , and died on sunday after battling blood poisoning for several weeks			1
investigators now believe up to 23 babies were fed using the tainted batch at 11 intensive care units across @entity15			1
tragic : a third baby has died after being given a contaminated batch of drip feed which affected 23 newborns			1
the latest death was at the @entity8 in @entity9 , on the same site as @entity22 's ( pictured ) the baby was fed using the tainted drip on may 27 , the same day authorities believe it was delivered by @entity27 pharmaceutical firm @entity26			1
health chiefs previously believed there were 22 cases - 18 confirmed and four possible - but the infant who died this weekend has now been linked to the ongoing investigation			1
a spokesman for @entity15 said : ' since the last update on june 12 , 2014 , a further case has been identified and the total number of cases linked to this investigation is 23 - 19 confirmed and four possible cases			1
' this baby has sadly died and our thoughts are with the family			0
this is the third confirmed case to have died and all three cases have been reported to the coroner			2
scandal : the babies were fed on a drip because they were too premature to feed , but became ill after being given an infected batch ( file picture ) ' the baby most recently identified received the implicated batch of @entity7 from may 27 , 2014 , but did not immediately develop sepsis so did not fit the case definition of the outbreak at that time			1
' however , recent microbiological tests have shown the presence of the outbreak strain			0
' produced by @entity27 pharmaceutical firm @entity26 , @entity7 is designed to feed babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own			1
the most recent victim of the tainted batch , who has not been named , fell ill several weeks ago at the @entity64 , which is on the same site as @entity9 's @entity67 and run by the same health trust			2
a spokesman for the trust said : ' our thoughts are with the family and we are supporting them during this very difficult and emotional time			0
' a consultant neonatologist has spoken to all of the families on the unit			0
' the babies on the unit have been closely monitored for any signs of infection since we withdraw the contaminated feed			2
we are confident that no other newborns have contracted bacillus cereus			1
' the two other babies who were ill are stable and doing well			0
' outbreaks have occurred across @entity15 , including at @entity27 's @entity88 , @entity90 ’s and @entity89 , the @entity91 and the @entity92			1
outside @entity27 other outbreaks have been at @entity94 & @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			2
the first baby to die was nine - day - old @entity103 on june 1 at @entity104 , @entity27			0
upsetting : 11 hospitals in @entity15 were affected			2
the @entity8 based at @entity106 's in @entity9 now has three cases , a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips the second was not named but died midway through last month			1
officials said at the time that the death did not appear to be linked to the infection itself			0
investigators have almost finished their inquiry and believe the contamination was an ' isolated incident '			1
total parenteral nutrition ( @entity7 ) is used to slowly drip - feed patients who are too weak to eat			0
it is not just used for babies - patients commonly receive it directly into their bloodstream for 10 or 12 hours at a time			0
it is believed the contaminated batch contained the bacteria bacillus cereus			1
the bacteria are often found in cooked foods like rice and soups which have been left at room temperature for too long			0
they produce toxins which cause diahorrhea , stomach cramps and vomiting when eaten			0
but because the toxins were injected directly into the bloodstream and the patients were babies with a poor immune system , they would have had a more serious effect			0
how the bacteria could have ended up inside a medical drip is still being investigated			0
professor @entity149 , incident director at @entity15 , said : ' the main findings have all pointed towards there being a single incident that occurred on one day			2
' we are reassured that this was a very rare occurrence as we have not seen this particular strain of bacteria in any product made since that day and there has been no further illness			0
' @entity161 , a director at the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) , added : ' at this stage , our investigation has provided sufficient evidence to indicate that the contamination was introduced into the specific @entity7 ( @entity7 ) supplies during manufacture in a particular sterile manufacturing area at @entity26 on may 27 , 2014			2
' there is no evidence to suggest that individual ingredients , components or materials used for the manufacture of @entity7 on may 27 , 2014 , were the cause of the contamination			0
' however , what we do know from our investigation is that the strain of @entity130 which infected the babies has also been identified at @entity26 ’s manufacturing facility and within some of the unopened @entity7 supplies manufactured on may 27 , 2014			2
' from our investigation to date , we continue to believe this was an isolated incident and that appropriate immediate action has been taken at @entity26 ’s facility to avoid a recurrence			1
' therefore we are allowing this critical product to be supplied to patients while our investigation continues			0
