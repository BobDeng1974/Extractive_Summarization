the genome of the four - year - old boy , who died in south - central @entity7 , is the oldest sequenced to date			1
it provides an insight into origins of @entity3 whose ancestors are believed to have travelled across @entity7 into the @entity12 during the @entity13			2
dna extracted from the skeleton of a young boy who died 24,000 years ago could prove that the first @entity3 were @entity4 a cross-section of an arm bone from the 24,000 - year - old skeleton found in @entity7			1
researchers managed to extract @entity1 from the bones and trace the ancient individual 's genetic lineage writing in the journal nature , the researchers claim that around 30 per cent of modern @entity25 ancestry comes from the young boy ’s gene pool			1
‘ the result came as a complete surprise to us , ’ said professor @entity28 from @entity29 who led the study			0
‘ who would have thought that present - day @entity3 , who we learned in school derive from @entity38 , share recent evolutionary history with contemporary western @entity40 ? ’ the 24,000 year - old boy was unearthed in the 1920s by @entity44 archaeologists near the village of @entity46 , along the @entity47 in @entity7			1
scientists from @entity29 in @entity49 took a sample from the boy ’s arm bone , extracted dna from it and compared it to existing @entity25 populations			1
the boy was buried with a variety of artefacts including a @entity59 figurine they found that dna from the boy 's y chromosome and from the mitochondria ( the energy factories of the cells ) were of types found today in a region encompassing @entity4 , @entity69 and @entity70 and @entity71			1
interestingly , the boy showed no similarities with populations such as the @entity75 , @entity76 or @entity77			1
this puzzled researchers as today 's @entity3 are closely related to @entity38			0
one theory is that the boy ’s future relatives mixed with the ancestors of @entity38 at some time after he died			0
this result paints a picture of @entity40 24,000 years ago which is quite different from the present - day context			0
the genome of the young boy indicates that prehistoric populations related to modern western @entity40 occupied a wider geographical range into northeast @entity40 than they do today			1
' it tells us that these individuals that were living in @entity7 - in south - central @entity7 24,000 years ago - their genes contributed to first @entity3 ' genes , ' @entity100 researcher @entity99			2
' i think what it does is it helps to clarify some things and the first is that the @entity3 came from @entity7			2
' some archeologists had suggested that the first @entity3 could have come from @entity4 directly from transoceanic migration , and i think that this does a fairly good job clarifying that : it was a land migration or at least a coastal migration through @entity112			0
' the 24,000 year - old boy was unearthed in the 1920s by @entity44 archaeologists near the village of @entity46 , along the @entity47 in @entity7 land route : the findings dispute earlier theories that @entity121 ancestors came from @entity4 , instead suggesting they came from @entity7 and traveled by an earlier land attachment in the @entity123 previously , researchers had thought that people came from @entity4 into @entity126 , and then entered @entity7 from the south			1
the latest results suggest the @entity7 inhabitants may have come from the @entity69 and that there were multiple waves of migrations in @entity70 around this time			2
the research could also help explain some mysteries surrounding @entity25 origins			0
for example , some early @entity121 skeletons - such as the 9,000 - year - old @entity137 from - have physical features that , some believe , are typically @entity4			1
the latest research paints a picture of @entity40 24,000 years ago which is quite different from the present - day context			0
the genome of the young boy indicates that prehistoric populations related to modern western @entity40 occupied a wider geographical range into northeast @entity40 than they do today			2
scientsts believe most native americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a ' land bridge ' between @entity70 and @entity12 during the ice ages 15,000 years ago			0
these migrants , known as the ' @entity156 ' , populated most of @entity12			0
the latest results suggest the @entity7 inhabitants may have come from the @entity69 and that there were multiple waves of migrations in @entity70 around this time .			0

the genome of the four - year - old boy is the oldest sequenced to date
dna from the remains , discovered in @entity7 in the 1920s , are thought to contain a third of @entity25 ancestry 's gene pool
interestingly , the boy showed no similarities with populations in @entity126
