the @entity8 author , who was awarded a second @entity2 in october for @entity9 , said that even those in the best homes were talked down to by staff in ‘ the doting tones we use with babies ’			1

' depressing ' : the writer spoke out after helping to find a care home place for a disabled friend ‘ nobody should place the whole blame on scarcity of resources , ’ the 60 - year - old said			1
‘ that would be too complacent			0
‘ all the money in the world can not remedy failure of imagination			0
’ she told the @entity34 it was not just cases where residents were ‘ grossly violated ’ that were important , adding : ‘ with old age and disability it is the daily , unspectacular reality that poses a challenge			0
’ the novelist was horrified by the institutions she saw , which she said were either ‘ excruciatingly expensive ’ or ‘ utterly depressing ’			1
‘ we did n’t see anywhere dirty , but we saw places that were utterly depressing , ’ she said			1
‘ behind august frontages , edwardian houses degenerated into tiny passages , narrowed further by dumped food trolleys and filing cabinets			0
‘ manicured gardens and coastal views – all costed out in the monthly bill – were accessible only to visitors and the spryest of residents , while those in wheelchairs could gaze at the wall , ’ she said			0
