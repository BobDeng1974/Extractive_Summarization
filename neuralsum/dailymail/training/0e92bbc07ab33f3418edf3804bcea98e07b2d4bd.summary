by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 23 november 2012 @entity1 has consigned himself to a year in the doghouse with his wife even though he is getting ‘ cabin fever ’ stuck at home while he waits for the attention around his sex scandal to die down			1
friends have revealed that the former head of the @entity10 has given up his relentless schedule of high level meetings for ‘ self - imposed exile ’ and grovelling to his family			1
gone are his five - mile runs in the open air every morning in @entity18 - instead he has confined himself indoors and is working out on a treadmill			1
meanwhile his wife of 38 years , @entity28 , has made a point of going to work every day and leaving him home alone			1
among the blog posts she has written in her role as a spokeswoman for the @entity34 is the line : ‘ you know the old saying : ‘ if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is			1
' according to the @entity39 , friends of @entity1 are ‘ concerned ’ that a man so used to constantly working has nothing to do for the first time in his life			1
affair : @entity1 ' affair with biographer came to light earlier this month leading to his resignation from the @entity10 furious : mrs @entity28 marches ahead of her husband as his mistress and biographer @entity51 ( second left ) gazes at him adoringly his main focus is lying low and salvaging his marriage given that mrs @entity28 is said to be ‘ furious ’ over his conduct and has threatened to divorce him			1
@entity28 posted a piece entitled ' buyer beware – potentially deceptive mortgage ads are targeting veterans and older @entity61 ' in her role at the @entity34 on november 19			1
it reads : ' today , along with the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , our @entity63 sent letters to a number of lenders concerning potential violations of the @entity70 – advertising ( map ) rule , a new rule that took effect in august 2011 ... ' many of these potentially misleading practices seem to be directed at older @entity61 and servicemembers / veterans ... ' you know the old saying : “ if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is			1
” some advertisers will use your military or veteran status as a way to approach you , promising special deals or implying @entity87 approval ... ' and although mortgage rates are very low right now , an offer promising “ historically low rates ” may still have hidden traps that turn it into a bad deal			2
' @entity1 ’s close friend @entity94 , the former vice chief of staff of the @entity95 , said : ‘ basically he ’s the same guy but considerably more subdued , in terms of his spirit			1
‘ and that ’s understandable			2
his voice does n’t have the same peppiness in it			2
’ @entity1 is said to be weighing up his options about what to do the in the future including offers for a book deal , speaking engagements and interest from various corporations to serve on their boards			2
having hired media super-lawyer @entity111 he could also become a talking head on tv			2
for now , however , he hardly leaves the house and is having to prove to mrs @entity28 that he deserves her trust again			1
the @entity39 said he plans to put his life on hold for the next 12 months to sort out the mess			2
a friend said : ‘ several of us are concerned			2
he ’s a very active individual			0
he needs to stay active			0
’ another friend said : ‘ i asked him whether he ’d seen a certain article , and he said : '' no , send it my way			0
i ’m looking for something to read right now			0
'' ‘ he kept such a grueling schedule			0
this is unchartered territory for him right now			0
’ meanwhile mrs @entity28 has been in the office every day at the @entity34 in her role running the @entity133			1
she has written two blog posts in the last week including one about the dangers of buying a flood damaged car which includes the line : ‘ once you ’ve signed the contract you ’re committed , so know before you owe ! ’ long relationship : @entity1 and wife @entity22 , pictured last year , met on a blind date while he was at military academy until the scandal became public , the @entity144 seemed to have a rock solid marriage			1
they met on a blind date when @entity1 was a student at the military academy at @entity149 , where @entity22 's father was the superintendent			0
he graduated in june 1947 and the couple married the following month , before going on to have two children , @entity153 and @entity154 , and traveling the world with his work			0
despite moving 24 times in 38 years , @entity22 has also built her own career			1
she became a volunteer , performing military and family support roles on bases , before assuming her current title			0
a source has told the @entity165 that @entity1 has been ‘ falling all over himself ’ apologising but she ‘ is n’t listening ’			0
the source said : ‘ after all his lies , she does n't believe anything he says anymore , and she 's thinking about consulting a divorce attorney			0
' friends have also given fresh insight into how @entity1 became involved with @entity95 reservist @entity51 whilst she was writing his biography			0
a friend said that the general initially thought it was a book on @entity177 and that he ‘ belatedly ’ realized it was about him			0
when @entity51 told him about the six - figure advance he thought : ‘ well , i better help her to get it halfway right rather than pushing her away to have something come out that was half - baked			0
’ he also admitted that after breaking off the relationship he continued to help @entity51 with the project to try and put things back on a more ‘ professional plane ’ .			0
