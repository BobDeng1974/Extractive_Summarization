off target : it has been claimed the @entity2 does not shoot straight when it overheats at @entity3 the @entity2 was created for the requirements of the @entity6 armed forces but it is also used as an infantry weapon in around 50 countries			1
it is used in @entity9 by counterterrorism police			2
first made : 1995 calibre : 5.56 mm x 45 magazine capacity : 30 rounds weight : 3.63kg length : 755 - 1,002mm use in the @entity9 : between 2,000 and 3,000 g36 rifles belong to police forces across the country an assault rifle used by counter-terror police does not shoot straight when it gets hot , tests claim			1
the @entity2 is inaccurate by up to 20 feet at long range when temperatures top @entity26 , it was found			2
the weapon also becomes unreliable when it is left in direct sunlight , exposed to humidity or fired repeatedly , according to a confidential report			0
the findings have prompted an urgent inquiry into the @entity6 - made firearm , which is used by law enforcement officers across the @entity9			1
@entity9 's police forces use a short - barrelled version of the weapon known as the @entity38 – and have a total arsenal of up to 3,000			2
counter-terror and armed response unit officers use them when they need more firepower than the 9mm pistols or carbines they usually carry			0
now experts at the @entity48 's @entity49 ( @entity50 ) will lead the inquiry after @entity6 said the rifle had ' no future ' with its military			1
a leaked report commissioned by @entity57 's defence ministry said the precision and accuracy of the @entity2 deteriorated when it overheated , either because of the temperature or rapid fire			1
it concluded that when the atmospheric temperature reached @entity26 ( @entity65 ) , bullets missed their mark by about 50cm ( 20 inches ) at a range of 200m ( 220 yards ) and by up to six metres – about 20ft – over 500m ( 546 yards )			0
reports in the @entity6 media claimed it also started to become seriously inaccurate after it fired just two magazines – about 60 rounds			0
@entity73 denies the weapon is inaccurate			0
but @entity9 's @entity75 has asked @entity50 to consider the findings			2
@entity77 , spokesman on armed policing , said : ' the reliability of any weaponry that the police service uses is of paramount importance			0
' superintendent @entity83 , of the @entity84 , which guards @entity9 's atomic plants , said it had not experienced problems but added : ' we will monitor the situation and await advice from @entity50			0
' @entity9 police are said to be desperate for a new firearm to help curb the threat of terrorists carrying high - velocity automatic weapons and using body armour			0
officers are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their ageing armoury and are concerned by the discovery of heavy weapons among criminal gangs			0
under review : deputy chief constable @entity77 ( pictured ) , the spokesman on armed policing at the @entity75 , has said the findings will be referred to the @entity48 for urgent review in service : the weapon is used by police forces across the @entity9			1
they have a total arsenal of between 2,000 and 3,000 g36c rifles , a version that has a shorter barrel than @entity73 's standard - issue rifle the @entity2 , created in the early 1990s for @entity6 troops , is also used in around 50 other countries			1
@entity9 @entity119 used it in @entity120 but reports surfaced in 2012 that @entity122 used by @entity6 soldiers in @entity124 would overheat during prolonged firefights			1
in the @entity6 report , experts tested 304 rifles – including the short - barrelled version – and found none passed precision tests			1
they concluded : ' the causes for the reduced accuracy do not lie in one of the components ... but rather in the whole system			0
' lieutenant - colonel @entity137 , of the @entity6 defence ministry , said the @entity2 was now ' not fit for purpose '			1
@entity140 , of @entity73 , said the rifle complied with its original specifications , but a gun ' designed for the @entity144 ' did not meet current requirements			0
he added that the company had received no complaints from the 50 countries where the weapon is used but vowed to assist with the @entity9 review .			2

leaked report *suggests* @entity2 rifle did not shoot straight when it overheated
@entity6 army carried out tests and none of the 304 assault rifles passed
the weapon is used by @entity9 counterterrorism officers across the @entity9
an urgent @entity48 review has been called for in light of the findings
