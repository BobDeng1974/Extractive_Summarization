@entity0 will warn his @entity2 players that any shirts swapped with @entity5 's megastars after friday 's @entity7 tie must be replaced at their own cost – and anyone trading them at half - time will be shirtless for the rest of the game			1
a shirt - swap souvenir with @entity14 or @entity15 will cost them the price of a new shirt , priced at £ 39.99 at the club shop - unless they can persuade chairman @entity19 to dip into the £ 250,000 the @entity21 club will earn from the game			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 has issued warning to his players over shirt swapping ' we 're not wealthy enough to give any of our shirts away , ' said @entity2 boss @entity0			2
' if they give their shirt away they 're going to have to replace it			0
maybe the club will do it , i do n't know , but i 'm not going to do it			2
' it would appear that in the @entity39 they give their shirt away after every game – sometimes at half - time			1
i do n't understand why a top class player would want another top class player 's shirt at half - time			1
' if one of our players was trying to swap a shirt at half - time you could understand it , but they wo n't as they would n't have anything to wear in the second half			1
' @entity21 club will be seeking to cause a massive upset in the @entity7 on friday night it is a classic clash of the haves and have - nots in the @entity7 fourth round at the @entity60 on friday night			1
@entity2 runs largely with the help of volunteers and handful of full - time operational staff and their total annual wage bill for a year is just over £ 1million , roughly what players like the top players @entity14 will earn in a month at @entity5			1
' we were determined not to increase the ticket prices , ' said chief executive @entity71			0
' we 've charged £ 10 for a kid to watch on the terraces			2
you think it is quick win to make a lot of money on the night but in the longer term it does more harm than good			0
@entity5 stars like @entity15 earn in a month the equivalent of @entity2 's entire wage bill for a year ' once @entity5 go out of town we 're back to @entity21 and valuing those supporters again , so we must n't try to exploit the situation			2
we want to make sure we get the fans to come back			0
the game needs to be about more than what happens on the night			0
' this club has lost money for the last 10 years and has survived due to the generosity of individuals , who have the club at heart like the chairman , @entity19 , some directors and @entity99 , our major shareholder			0
' they do it for a genuine love for the club			0
after a lot of years of finding it really tough maybe this tie is a bit of luck that the club 's deserved			0

@entity2 players who swap shirts with @entity5 megastars will have to *buy* replacement from club shop
manager @entity0 warns any players following the trend of trading shirts at half - time will be shirtless for second half
