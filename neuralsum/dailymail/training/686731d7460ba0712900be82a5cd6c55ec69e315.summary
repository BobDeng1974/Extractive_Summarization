by @entity0 for @entity4 ’s @entity3 contestants , it was their first chance to impress the nation on live tv			2
but for viewers at home , the excitement of this week ’s semi-finals was somewhat dimmed – by the constant advert breaks			1
the @entity14 programme has been hit with complaints after almost a quarter of its first two live shows were taken up with commercials			1
end of the line : dance troupe @entity21 were eliminated on monday night 's show some fans joked they only tuned in for the adverts and were upset when these were interrupted by the occasional contestant , while others resorted to recording the show and fast - forwarding though the breaks			1
the first semi-final on monday night , which saw singing group @entity31 and @entity34 magician @entity33 put through to next week ’s final , was watched by an average of 9.1million viewers – down almost 700,000 on the same episode last series			2
many viewers reacted furiously on @entity40 when they realised the 90 - minute programme was saturated with six advert breaks , taking up almost 20 minutes of screen time			1
one fan , @entity44 , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s @entity3 has more adverts than acts ! sort it out # @entity14 # @entity47 becoming a bloody joke ! ’ winners : singing group @entity31 won the public vote another , @entity52 , tweeted : ‘ @entity4 ’s @entity3 ? not sure about that , but it ’s definitely got adverts			1
’ and @entity55 joked : ‘ do n’t you hate it when you ’re watching adverts , and suddenly # @entity47 comes on			2
’ others said they decided not to watch the show live and record it instead			0
it meant that although they could not vote for their favourite acts , they were able to fast - forward the adverts and enjoy the show uninterrupted			2
the half - hour live results show – which aired after @entity65 at 9.30pm – was watched by 7.8million viewers on monday night , meaning 1.3million decided not to stay up to find out who won			1
it contained a further eight minutes of adverts			0
like magic : @entity33 narrowly ousted impressionist @entity71 @entity31 won the public vote and @entity73 – who admitted this week he could understand why some fans are upset @entity47 contains a string of foreign acts – narrowly ousted impressionist @entity71			0
despite the best efforts of the nine contestants , the part of the show that generated the most comment online was @entity84 ’s revealing dress			0
over the course of the week , 45 acts will be whittled down to the final 10			0
the winner will be chosen on june 7			0
tonight ’s show will see burlesque dance troupe @entity89 take on a group of @entity94 drag artists for a coveted final spot			0
last night an @entity14 spokesman insisted the @entity47 semi-finals have the same number of adverts as other @entity14 programmes of the same length			1
he said : ‘ the number of minutes of advertising shown in @entity4 ’s @entity3 was no more than is usual in a programme of its length and was fully compliant with allowances stipulated in the @entity108 on the scheduling of tv advertising			0

@entity14 programme hit with complaints over ad - filled shows
almost a quarter of the first two live shows were commercial breaks
viewers reacted with fury - but @entity14 insists the *quantity* of adverts is *normal*
