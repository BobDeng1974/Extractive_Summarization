@entity0 overcame his shattering defeat to @entity2 by replaying the moment he was knocked out nine times the next morning			1
@entity0 , who was floored in the eighth round against @entity2 in may , is hoping to lay the demons to rest when he fights @entity9 @entity8 on september 20			1
the bout will serve as a final @entity12 title eliminator but it has added importance for @entity0 , who is looking for rejuvenation after his loss to @entity2 in front of 80,000 fans at @entity18			1
@entity0 watched the fight back three times that same night and trainer @entity21 made his pupil go through it all again the following morning			1
@entity2 is ready to return to the ring for the first time since his defeat to @entity2 he will take on @entity9 @entity8 on september 20 in a @entity12 title eliminator @entity28 said : ' i went over the next morning and we watched the fight again and then i took a gamble and rewound it - we watched it nine times and @entity0 looked at me as if to say " all right "			1
' i brought up as many emotions as i could so he could deal with them earlier			0
' @entity28 continued : ' i did n't just watch it nine times with my arms round him - we looked at it and asked why it happened			2
@entity2 defeated @entity0 in eight rounds at @entity18 in may in front of 80,000 fans ' i wanted him to feel the emotion early and deal with it , like when you get a brown envelope through the door and you do n't open it because you know it 's bad news			1
' you have to deal with it before you can move on			0
' @entity0 spent the following week away in @entity53 with his wife @entity54 and says it was important to come to terms with the @entity2 defeat before considering his next move			1
' i did n't realise @entity21 was testing me but it was fine , ' @entity0 said			1
' you ca n't talk about being a realist and then shy away from it			0
i did n't get angry , it was just frustrating			0
i was still pretty numb			0
' i took time away and the rest of the week was difficult but by the time i got home i wanted to get back to work			2
' the animosity between @entity2 and @entity0 that drew so much attention in the build - up to both fights has not cooled over the past four months			1
@entity0 throws a left hook at @entity2 during their super fight in @entity74 @entity2 unblocked his opponent on @entity76 but otherwise there has been no contact between the pair , which leads @entity0 to believe there could be a third fight in the future			1
' @entity2 does n't like me and that 's fine , he 'll have a swipe at me at every moment , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's certainly not satisfied after the last fight and i wonder why - if i knocked somebody out i 'd be pretty satisfied with it			0
but he 's not , he ca n't put it to bed			0
' for that reason only , i think there might be a third fight because he does n't like me			0
' for whatever reason - perhaps he said more prayers than i did - he came out with two wins in a fight i said he could n't win			0
' i do n't need to be @entity2 's friend and i do n't plan to be			2
' @entity0 also endures a frosty relationship with @entity100 after he inflicted the first loss of @entity100 's professional career in 2011			2
' fighters do n't like me and i think it 's because if you watch me box , everyone thinks i 'm s * * * , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity2 looks over @entity0 after a knock down in their grudge match in may ' and i 'm happy to talk back to an opponent or a rival and pull them apart when sometimes boxing etiquette is to smile and nod along			1
' i can be humble and i can be a realist and tell the truth - and i usually go out and deliver as well			0
that 's probably what upsets everyone			0
' the winner of @entity0 and @entity8 will become the mandatory challenger to @entity122 @entity121 for the @entity12 super-middleweight world title			1
@entity8 has recorded 22 wins , two defeats and three draws in his career so far but the 32 - year - old goes into the fight at @entity129 as underdog			2
' he 's a champion , he has a good track record and he has never been stopped , ' @entity0 said			2
' he is coming as a @entity133 champion and he has dreams and ambitions and that makes him dangerous			0
' i think i am better than him and i need to let him know that but i wont be gung - ho , i wo n't go in swinging			0
' @entity0 added : ' for my own sanity rather than my reputation , i do n't want to lose			2
i 'm fully capable of winning and i will win			0
