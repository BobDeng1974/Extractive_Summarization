lawmakers and activists are denouncing the @entity4 administration 's collection of phone records for millions of @entity6 as an orwellian , outrageous breach of privacy that calls for investigation , while the @entity10 is defending the practice as a ' critical tool ' for fighting terrorism			1
' from a civil liberties perspective , the program could hardly be any more alarming , ' said @entity16 , the @entity17 's deputy legal director			0
' it is beyond @entity19 , and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies			2
' the @entity17 is demanding an investigation into the practice , which @entity16 says is unconstitutional			0
@entity30 sen. @entity29 , the chairwoman of the @entity31 , confirmed on thursday that the @entity4 administration has been collecting telephone records of millions of @entity6 @entity35 customers			1
the top secret court order for the telephone records , which was reported by @entity39 newspaper late wednesday , is actually a three - month renewal of an ongoing practice , she said			1
spying : the @entity42 has been getting millions of phone records from @entity35 on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order , that was only revealed today double bind : part of the order mandated that @entity35 not tell its ' customer 's about the record transfer nor could they admit that the order existed @entity30 sen. @entity55 of @entity56 damned the practice as an ' outrageous breach of @entity6 ' privacy			1
' the @entity4 administration defended the order on thursday , calling it ' a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats			2
' a senior administration official said the practice ' does not allow the government to listen in on anyone ’s telephone calls ' and ' does not include the content of any communications or the name of any subscriber , ' but rather ' relates exclusively to metadata , such as a telephone number or the length of the call			0
' the order requires @entity35 , one of the nation 's largest telecommunications companies , on an ' ongoing , daily basis ' to give the @entity42 information on all telephone calls in its systems , both within the @entity6 and between the @entity6 and other countries			1
the order was granted by the secret @entity88 on april 25 and is good until july 19			1
because of the lack of distinction , it means that the phone records are not just being collected for suspected terrorists , but the company 's entire consumer base			1
the only restriction set forth in the order seems to be the duration of the exchange			0
it was approved by the @entity88 on april 25 and it denoted that it would only hold water until july 19 , so just shy of three months			1
@entity35 is believed to have nearly 150million customers across the @entity6 , all of whom could potentially be affected by the controversial court order			1
lashing out : former vice president @entity106 called the surveillance ' outrageous ' , not supporting his fellow democrats timing : the revelation comes the same day as president @entity4 announced his appointment of @entity111 ( right ) to be the new head of the @entity42 , replacing @entity113 ( center ) this news comes just as the @entity4 administration is in the process of explaining itself for secretly subpoenaing the phone records of journalists at the @entity121 and @entity122 without notifying either organization			1
that case was tied to a national security leak , and caused uproar from which the @entity127 is still reeling			2
in this latest instance of unexplained government spying , the government order gives them records of all calls made from certain numbers , and lists what phone numbers they called and how long the call lasted			1
the data does not include recordings of the conversation or a transcription of those calls			0
the @entity39 reports that the copy of the order shows that the court ordered @entity35 to give the @entity42 ' all call detail records or ' telephony metadata ' created by @entity35 for communications between the @entity6 and abroad '			1
wide - reaching : millions of @entity35 customers had their data turned over to the @entity42 , and it is not known whether similar orders were given to other phone companies as well these records must ' continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this order '			1
it is hereby ordered that , the @entity159 shall produce to the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) upon service of this order , and continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this order ...			1
an electronic copy of the following tangible things : all call detail records or " telephony metadata " created by @entity35 for communications ( i ) between the @entity6 and abroad ; or ( ii ) wholly within the @entity6 , including local telephone calls			1
telephony metadata includes comprehensive communications routing information ,			0
including but not limited to session identifying information ( e.g. , originating and terminating telephone number ... and time and duration of call			0
telephony metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication , as defined by 18 @entity180 ? 2510 ( 8 ) , or the name , address , or financial information of a subscriber or customer			0
the secret nature of the order means that @entity35 was forbidden to disclose the nature of the order and the existence of the order itself			1
as such , there is no way of knowing whether similar orders have been put upon other telephone carriers , making the web of possible victims unlimited			0
an expert in electronic freedom practices says that it was unlikely that @entity35 would be the only subject of such an order and that the other major carriers probably had similar orders against them			2
' that 's not the society we 've built in the @entity6 , ' said @entity209 , an attorney at the @entity210 , which is suing the @entity42 over surveillance inside the country			2
' it 's not the society we set forth in the @entity215 , and it 's not the society we should have			0
' he is n't the only one reacting to the news , as former vice president @entity106 took to @entity219 to call the revelation ' obscenely outrageous '			0
his decision to come forward is an important one , as he served for two terms under former president @entity224 , who will most likely remain silent because of his close association with president @entity4 - particularly as his wife , former secretary of state @entity227 is the likely 2016 @entity30 nominee for president			0
looking back , @entity30 senators @entity229 and @entity231 warned that the government was abusing their privileges when it came to spying			0
the two men , who sit on the @entity31 , cryptically warned that there would be backlash should any of the federal tricks be revealed			0
' when the @entity6 people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the @entity241 , they are going to be stunned and they are going to be angry , ' they wrote in a joint letter to attorney general @entity243 in 2012			0
' as we see it , there is now a significant gap between what most @entity6 think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows			0
' warning : senators @entity231 ( left ) and @entity229 ( right ) wrote a letter warning the attorney general that there would be public outcry should the government 's actions become public the @entity17 put out an immediate statement calling for an end to the program - which is scheduled to run until july 19 - and a investigation into the order			1
' from a civil liberties perspective , the program could hardly be any more alarming , ' @entity17 deputy legal director @entity16 said in a statement			0
' it ’s a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents			0
' it is beyond @entity19 , and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies			0
' the order is the first concrete evidence that @entity6 intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under president @entity286 and caused great controversy when it was first exposed			2
in 2005 , the @entity288 reported that the @entity42 was wiretapping @entity6 without warrants on international calls			2
@entity291 and @entity292 later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls			2
in addition , a former @entity298 technician , @entity297 , said that a room accessible only with @entity42 clearance in the carrier 's main @entity303 hub received perfect copies of all transmissions			2
@entity35 is the second biggest @entity6 telephone company behind @entity298 in terms of revenue			2
the vast majority of @entity35 's overseas operations come from its acquisition of @entity312 , which is also covered by the order although foreign - to - foreign calls are exempted from it .			1

a copy of a secret order shows that the @entity42 ordered @entity35 to hand over millions of phone records with no explanation
order extends from until july 19 and includes domestic and foreign calls
nearly 150million @entity35 customers could be affected by the court order
comes just after news of the @entity127 spying on journalists
