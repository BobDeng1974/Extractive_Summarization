by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 4 december 2012 @entity1 is losing more from vat loopholes on the sale of digital services than it cost to put on the @entity5 , new research shows			1
the study by a leading telecoms and digital consultancy reveals the @entity10 is losing over £ 1.6billion a year in @entity11 on digital services bought by @entity1 consumers from overseas - based suppliers such as @entity15			1
@entity16 estimates the @entity1 will lose £ 10billion between 2008 and 2014			1
ministers say the @entity18 cost taxpayers £ 9billion			1
read all about it : @entity15 charges publishers 20 per cent vat when it only pays 3 per cent in tax it comes as more pressure is being heaped on chancellor @entity25 to close tax loopholes enjoyed by multinational companies in wednesday 's autumn statement			2
the chancellor is expected to find more cash in the autumn statement to fund a drive by @entity10 to raise an additional £ 10billion in tax revenues			1
but the revelation that @entity1 is losing so much revenue through tax loopholes will intensify demands at @entity36 and beyond for tougher action on multinationals , such as @entity39 and @entity40 , paying small amounts of tax			1
the anti-tax avoidance pressure group @entity43 said that it was planning protests in @entity40 cafes this saturday , involving ' creative civil disobedience '			0
it follows stinging criticism of tax avoidance mps on the public accounts committee who accused the coffee chain , @entity39 and @entity15 of ' immoral ' use of secretive jurisdictions , royalties and complex company structures to avoid paying tax on @entity1 profits			1
@entity58 , the committee 's chair , said she had already stopped buying coffee at @entity40 and ceased using @entity15			0
' @entity61 ' : the @entity63 chairman @entity58 called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the government should back boycotts ' i think actually the government can do things like … we buy a lot of stuff , we can say we wo n't buy from companies			2
i think it 's good citizenship , ' she told @entity79			0
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' the issue for government is how we tackle that tax avoidance			2
' what we have to do in government is make sure we are tackling that kind of aggressive tax avoidance			2
we are doing that in a number of ways			0
we are bringing in a general anti-avoidance rule , we are working with other countries			0
' the question of a boycott was ' an issue for individuals ' , said the spokesman			0
under the @entity105 's vat rules , digital supplies to non-business customers – such as ebooks , music downloads and online apps – are classified as services rather than products			1
' this is yet another example of industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational corporations			0
their behaviour is irresponsible , unethical and unacceptable			0
' @entity113 mp vat on electronic services is imposed at the rate applying to the country in which a company is headquartered rather than the rate applied by the country in which it is bought			0
@entity15 , for example , is based in @entity123 and therefore charges its customers 3 per cent vat for ebooks , compared with the 20 per cent levied in the @entity1			2
@entity113 , a @entity126 mp and a former tax lawyer , believes that the @entity105 should accelerate plans to change the way @entity11 is charged on digital services , which is due to be phased in between 2015 and 2019			1
' this is yet another example of industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational corporations			0
their behaviour is irresponsible , unethical and unacceptable , ' he said			0
the @entity136 report was commissioned by @entity137 , chairman of the @entity140 senate 's finance committee and was prepared for a private meeting of pan-european politicians , civil servants and tax specialists in @entity145			0
mr @entity137 supports an earlier date for bringing into line with other goods the rules for charging @entity11 on digital services			1
' at the @entity155 level we need to renegotiate the schedule for implementing the @entity158 directive on electronic services in order to bring its application deadline nearer than 2015 or 2019 , the term of the transition phase , ' he said			1
an @entity10 spokesman told @entity79 : ' it is a natural consequence of the vat rules rather than any lack of compliance that a business in say , @entity168 , supplying such services to @entity1 customers will account for @entity158 in @entity168 and not in the @entity1			1
' businesses have the freedom to establish themselves in whichever member state they wish			0
' however , some @entity1 businesses claimed to have moved their operations to other member states in order to benefit from lower vat rates where in reality the supplies were still made from the @entity1			2
@entity10 has successfully challenged such arrangements			2
