by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 28 september 2012 whoops : @entity2 said that the @entity3 got his @entity5 question wrong to look less clever before making a glaring error himself @entity2 today accused @entity7 of pretending not to know what @entity8 meant before embarrassingly getting an easy question wrong himself			1
the @entity13 mayor said the prime minister was trying to hide how clever he was just before he failed to name who scored a hat - trick for @entity17 in the 1966 @entity19 final			1
mr @entity2 should have answered @entity20 , but was miles off when he said it was centre back and captain @entity23			1
tellingly his claim the @entity26 leader feigned ignorance exposes the growing rift between the prime minister and the outspoken @entity13 mayor , seen as his main rival to lead the @entity26			1
mr @entity7 was widely mocked for his appearance on @entity35 television ’s @entity33 with @entity5 earlier this week after the @entity35 host quizzed him on @entity38 history			1
the grilling included being asked what @entity8 meant and who composed @entity42			0
the prime minister fluffed both questions , but his fellow @entity45 and @entity47 contemporary mr @entity2 today claimed mr @entity7 really knew @entity8 meant @entity8 and faked the apparent knowledge gap to appear more down - to - earth			1
classics scholar mr @entity2 said : ' i think he was only pretending			0
i think he knew full well what @entity8 means			0
' it was a brilliant move in order to show his demotic credentials and that he did n’t have @entity56 bursting out of every orifice			0
' terrible mistake : @entity2 plumped for captain @entity23 , centre , rather than the man to his right , hat trick hero @entity20 was it over ? @entity20 ( out of picture ) famously scored three in the @entity65 on july 30 , 1966 at @entity66 - including this one where the ball hit the bar and bounced down quizzed on more modern @entity38 history during an appearance on @entity72 radio , mr @entity2 failed to correctly identify @entity20 as the scorer of a hat - trick in the 1966 @entity19 final victory over @entity76 , the only time @entity17 have ever been world champions			1
mr @entity2 claimed defender @entity23 netted three			2
in fact , @entity23 was the captain who held aloft the @entity79 trophy at @entity66			2
perhaps realising the revelation could damage his dreams of claiming the keys to no 10 @entity84 , the 48 - year - old mayor protested : ' i was only two ! ' interview : @entity7 's appearance on @entity5 was overshadowed by his failure to get a few questions about @entity38 right - but @entity2 says he did it to look less clever rivals : mr @entity7 and mr @entity2 could soon be fighting for leadership of the @entity26 party in a wide - ranging interview and phone - in with presenter @entity96 , mr @entity2 faced the anger of @entity13 taxi drivers frustrated by transport arrangements during the @entity100			1
he apologised to businesses whose trade was hit by the summer spectacle , but denied claims the capital became a ' ghost town '			0
mr @entity2 said : ' i ’m not going to pretend it was a bonanza for everybody and for those that feel hard done by , i ’m sorry for the losses or low takings they had			0
' but the overall economic benefit to @entity13 of people around the world seeing a city that can deliver an amazing event like that so successfully was incredibly positive			2
' the mayor admitted trade was ' patchy ' , but claimed the @entity123 were “ overwhelmingly for the benefit of the city '			2
he added : ' if you look at the spend by tourists in the city , it was up overall			0
' the economic impact of the @entity123 is estimated to be massively positive			0

the mayor of @entity13 answered @entity23 then *blamed* his age for getting it wrong
he also said @entity7 got answers incorrect to make himself look less clever
