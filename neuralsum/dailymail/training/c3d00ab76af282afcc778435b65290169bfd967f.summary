these are the horrific injuries a great - grandmother suffered when she fell on a street after being dazzled by new patterns in the pavement			1
@entity5 , 74 , was walking along new street in the centre of @entity7 when she slipped on the kerb , which she failed to spot because the colour scheme leaves it ' virtually invisible '			1
mrs @entity5 , a retired factory worker from @entity11 , @entity12 , suffered a broken nose , twisted ankle ligaments and a severely bruised face as a result and is scared of going back into the town			1
she says she failed to spot the gap because of the new colour scheme terrified : the great - grandmother from @entity11 , @entity12 , is now scared to go back into the town the street has recently re-opened as a shared space , where the pavement and the road both have the same block - paved surface			1
but @entity30 is now facing calls to review the revamp because of safety concerns			1
mrs @entity5 , whose face is still badly bruised three weeks after the ordeal , believes the lack of visual distinction between the two is dangerous and needs to be addressed			2
she said : ' i think it ’s terrible			0
it is dangerous because you ca n’t differentiate between the road and the pavement			0
i think they should do something , paint a white line , anything			0
' more than 50 people have signed an online petition urging the council to make the drop from the pavement to the road more visible			0
slip : mrs @entity5 suffered a broken nose and horrific facial injuries as a result of the fall pattern : the street has recently re-opened as a shared space , where the pavement and the road both have the same patterned surface but the council says that although some pedestrians are having difficulty identifying the kerb , the new arrangement is satisfactory overall			1
mrs @entity5 has sent a letter of complaint to @entity30 about the incident , but says she has yet to receive a reply			1
she was walking with her daughter and her partner , who had travelled over from @entity75 , when she suffered the fall			2
it was the second time she has walked in the area since the new pavement was unveiled , having previously been down it with a friend , but crucially this time she was on the outside of the pavement			0
fears : mrs @entity5 , pictured with her dog @entity85 , also twisted a ligament when she lost her footing old layout : pedestrians could differentiate between the road and the pavement before the changes aggrieved : the grandmother , who was walking with her daughter at the time , sent a letter of complaint to @entity30 ‘ my foot went down the side , i banged my head and broke my nose			1
' my daughter and her partner picked me up and a gentleman from the solicitors nearby took me into his office and sat me down , ’ she added			0
an ambulance was called and mrs @entity5 was checked over by paramedics			1
she went to accident and emergency at @entity7 ’s @entity113 the next day			2
since the fall , mrs @entity5 has avoided walking in the town centre on her own			1
she added : ‘ the doctor said i had broken my nose and that i was lucky because it was straight and it would n’t need surgery			2
‘ i had twisted my right foot and pulled a ligament			0
it ’s not too bad now but it was very , very painful			0
‘ i ’m all right now , but i ’m still very nervous about walking on the pavements in the town centre			2
‘ if i go with my friend i ’m all right but i have not been up on my own since - i really do n’t like going into town			2
’ a spokesperson for @entity30 said : ‘ we can confirm we have received mrs @entity5 ’s complaint			1
' it will be addressed through the usual channels and she will be informed of the outcome			0
’ @entity133 said that there had been no significant increase in call - outs to injuries caused by falls in the town centre since the new paving had been installed			1
however , in january , local authorities in @entity7 were warned that ' hypnotic ' patterns on @entity143 could give pedestrians epileptic fits and confuse people with dementia			1
councillor @entity148 , who suffers from epilepsy , said at the time : ' it is a risk to anyone who suffers with photosensitive epilepsy			2
it 's not just strobe lights that can trigger seizures ; patterns and shapes can cause it			0
' a spokesman for @entity161 said the group had ' real areas of concern ' about the potential risks in the area			0
concerns : @entity143 , also in @entity7 town centre , has been given a similar makeover - and in january its patterned slabs were branded a risk because of their ' hypnotic pattern ' the blocks also came under fire from businesses , residents and taxi drivers , many of whom have branded them a ' waste of money '			1
the case is similar to @entity183 in @entity184 , where three pedestrians received pay - outs because of slips and falls in 2010			0
individuals were paid sums of £ 2,000 , £ 6,000 , £ 12,876 and £ 14,225 , depending on the nature of their injuries			0
in 2012 authorities in @entity194 splashed out £ 13,500 for an anti-algae treatment after a pavement was causing people to slide in the town centre 's historic @entity198 .			0

@entity5 was walking on new street , @entity7 , when she slipped
