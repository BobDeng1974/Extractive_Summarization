there were few wealthier men in the @entity2 than @entity3 born into an august banking family , he had spent his life accumulating a multi-million - dollar fortune by investing shrewdly in railways and banking			1
like many rich men , @entity3 liked to collect objects as well as money			2
while most ordinary men collected stamps or coins , he acquired holiday homes , modern art , motorboats and expensive watches			0
his favourite boat was his 50 - foot speedster , the @entity21 , on which he liked to potter around the @entity23 in @entity24			0
her eyes widened when he pulled a large watch out of his pocket and looked at it intensely			0
‘ such things bring one nothing but trouble , ’ said @entity3 , who by then was in his late 60s			2
‘ @entity43 brings bad fortune			0
’ @entity32 knew that this was no ordinary timepiece			0
it was the ultimate expression of her father ’s obsession with collecting watches and , in particular , those made by the @entity53 firm @entity52			1
this week , that watch broke records at auction when it was sold by @entity57 in @entity58 for £ 13.4 million to an anonymous bidder			1
with auction house costs , the mystery buyer will have to fork out a total of £ 15.1 million			2
it comes as no surprise , for the watch is commonly regarded as the most important ever made , the ‘ @entity29 of @entity66 ’			2
@entity3 had been buying watches from @entity52 since 1903 , and by 1910 he had started to commission them			1
many were engraved with the family ’s coat of arms			0
but he wanted more than mere engravings to make his watches special			0
he wanted his @entity74 to be the most complex watches in the world , including as many ‘ complications ’ as possible - the horological term for any feature of a watch that goes beyond simply showing hours , minutes and seconds			1
such was his obsession that he started competing with @entity82 , a luxury car manufacturer , to see who could produce the most impressive timepiece			2
@entity3 secretly approached @entity52 in 1925			1
he wanted , he insisted , nothing less than ‘ the most complicated watch ’ on the planet , one that was ‘ impossibly elaborate ’			0
what followed was , in the words of author @entity93 in her book @entity95 , ‘ a nearly eight - year odyssey ’ in which teams of @entity52 ’s craftsmen , scientists and engineers did , indeed , create the most complicated watch made before the age of computer - aided design			1
made by @entity52 , the @entity105 is the most complex watch ever assembled entirely by hand and took five years to make they spent three years researching the project and five years making the watch			1
in total , the timepiece — with two clock faces , one on each side — has 24 complications			1
one shows the @entity117 , others the times of sunset and sunrise in @entity24 and even the pattern of the stars each night above mr @entity3 ’s apartment in the city			2
there are complications revealing the days of the week , an alarm , a stopwatch and a perpetual calendar			1
grave ’s masterpiece blew @entity134 ’s out of the water			0
@entity134 had got there first and his was the first watch to feature a sky chart , including 500 golden stars , centered above his home in @entity142			2
yet the masterpiece that became known as the @entity105 never brought its owner the pleasure he expected			1
after he had taken delivery of it in 1933 at a cost of $ 15,000 ( about £ 650,000 at today ’s prices ) the @entity105 seemed to bring him not only unwanted attention but great misfortune - so much so that on the @entity21 on that day in 1936 , @entity3 cut the engine of the boat and looked from the watch to the water			1
‘ what is the point of being wealthy and owning such objects if something like this could happen ? ’ he asked his daughter			0
it was the time of the @entity164 , and @entity3 had become a figure of public resentment after people who were starving and destitute discovered that he could spend thousands on such luxuries			2
in total , the timepiece - with two clock faces , one on each side - has 24 complications			1
one shows the @entity117 , others the times of sunset and sunrise in @entity24 and even the pattern of the stars each night above mr @entity3 ’s apartment in the city but the banker believed the watch had brought him far worse than opprobrium in the public prints			1
in fact , he became convinced that it had come with a deadly curse			0
just seven months after @entity3 received the watch , his best friend died			1
and worse was to come			0
in early november 1934 , @entity3 answered the telephone to be told that his youngest son , @entity193 , had been hurtling in a car down a boulevard in @entity196 , @entity197 , and crashed , killing himself			1
the news was devastating , and made even worse by the fact that @entity3 had lost his eldest son , @entity200 , in a car crash in 1922 when he was just 25 years old			1
for @entity3 , the @entity105 was a bad talisman , something that was meant to have brought him joy but had , instead , ushered in grief and hateful publicity			1
at one point he had come close to selling the watch , but decided against it			2
as the boat bobbed in the water , @entity32 watched her father pull back his arm			0
in his hand was the @entity105 and he was about to throw it into the lake			2
‘ no , @entity216 ! ’ @entity32 implored			0
‘ let me hold on to that			0
some day i might want that			0
’ @entity3 slowly let his arm fall to his side			0
@entity32 reached forward gingerly and took the watch from his hand , then put it in her pocket			0
with auction costs , the final price paid by a ' man in a red tie'b at the auction in @entity58 , @entity53 , was £ 15.1 million - a new world record from then on , @entity32 held on to the watch			1
her father lost interest in an item that he had craved all his life - a life that was to end in 1953 , when he was 86			0
after his death , @entity32 inherited the @entity105 and in 1960 passed it to her son , @entity235 , who sold it to an industrialist from @entity238 for $ 200,000 — some £ 1million today			1
until 1999 the watch was displayed in a museum in @entity238 , then it was sold to a private collector by @entity57 ’s in @entity24 for $ 11 million ( about £ 10 million today )			2
the auction house will not be drawn on the identities of either the seller or the buyer			0
but both will for ever thank @entity247 for stopping her father throwing the world ’s most extraordinary timepiece into a cold lake in @entity24 all those decades ago .			0

@entity2 banker @entity27 ordered the ' @entity105 ' watch @entity53 manufacturer @entity52 in 1925
it was so complex that it later became known as the ' @entity29 ' of watches and sold at auction this week for £ 15.1m
the timepiece featured 24 complications including perpetual calendar , moon *phases* and night sky of @entity264
but it never brought @entity3 the pleasure he expected and just seven months after he received it , his best friend died
worse was to come when his youngest son @entity193 was killed in car crash on a boulevard in @entity196 , @entity197
@entity3 came close to selling watch believing it to be a bad talisman but his daughter *persuaded* him to keep it
this article draws on the book , a grand complication : the race to build @entity284 ’s @entity283 by @entity93 , published by @entity285 / @entity285 .
