devastated defender @entity0 has admitted @entity1 had only themselves to blame for an unprecedented fourth successive derby defeat by @entity3			1
sunday 's high - octane clash at @entity5 looked to be heading for a first goalless draw since may 1990 when @entity7 settled it with a 90th - minute winner , his third goal in as many visits to @entity12			1
@entity13 was little more than the @entity3 deserved after creating the better chances throughout the game , but it arrived with the @entity16 on top and pushing for a winner of their own			2
@entity0 ( right ) finds himself on the wrong side of @entity3 forward @entity21 on sunday @entity0 collided with the post during the match , resulting in him needing two stitches in the wound @entity0 said : ' we ca n't believe it			2
we were looking at the clock and thinking it would be a draw			0
' we were just looking to see the game out			2
' maybe we got a bit carried away			0
sometimes you have to shut the back door			0
it came from our own set - piece so we only have ourselves to blame			2
' i just ca n't believe it 's another season that we have been beaten			0
' @entity1 went into the game desperate not to set a new record for consecutive tyne - wear derby defeats and knowing they had a debt to repay to their fans after losing to last two editions on their own pitch 3 - 0			1
@entity1 lost in the 90th minute when @entity7 fired home against keeper @entity48 @entity7 gestures to the @entity3 supporters at the full - time whistle as he revels in the moment on a day when both sets of fans put aside their fierce rivalry momentarily - the travelling supporters joined in the 17th - minute applause for @entity58 and @entity59 , who died in the @entity61 disaster , and their @entity1 counterparts acknowledged their efforts in raising more than Â£ 33,000 for a memorial 16 minutes later - the home side started as if they meant business			1
however , the initial flurry , during which a @entity3 defence shorn of the services of specialist full - back @entity69 - he had damaged a calf muscle during the warm - up - was at sixes and sevens , failed to produce tangible reward and @entity77 's men responded in concerted fashion			0
as @entity79 and @entity80 started to gain the upper hand in the middle of the field , @entity21 clipped the crossbar with a side - footed effort and @entity86 forced a good save from rookie keeper @entity48 , who did not wilt in the heat of the derby atmosphere			0
@entity80 and @entity7 both passed up glorious opportunities to give the visitors the lead , but in the meantime , @entity3 keeper @entity93 needed every bit of his 6ft 8in frame to get to @entity98 's 63rd - minute shot as it curled towards the top corner			1
@entity0 looked in a bad way as he was assisted by @entity1 medics in the goalmouth during the match @entity0 was disappointed with the result , but says @entity1 only have themselves to blame but with the clock running down , @entity7 held off @entity107 inside his own half and then set off towards the @entity110 goal , finding @entity21 before making his way into the box to dispatch substitute @entity114 's lay - off from the @entity117 international 's pass			1
@entity0 , who had two stitches put into a head wound after a nasty collision with the post as he denied @entity21 a certain goal , was left to rue a lack of cutting edge at the other end of the pitch			1
he said : ' we had the chances			0
everything was at the keeper - straight at him			0
two or three yards either side of him is a different ball game			0
' we are gutted with that , but @entity7 is a top - class player and he proved that today			1

@entity1 lost the @entity135 after a late @entity7 goal
@entity0 says @entity1 were just trying to see the game out
earlier on , @entity0 crashed into the post and cut his eye and cheek
the @entity1 defender also said @entity7 is a top - class player
