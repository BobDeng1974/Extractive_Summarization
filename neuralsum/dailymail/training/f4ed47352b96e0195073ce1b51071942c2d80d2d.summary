@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 played starring , stirring roles as @entity5 ’s golfers romped to an eighth @entity7 victory in the last 10 contests			1
the @entity10 , by contrast , were publicly melting down as recriminations began to fly over the reasons for their latest dismal failure			2
@entity5 ’s overnight lead of 10 - 6 was extended to a final tally of 16½ - 11½ , with @entity0 thrashing @entity16 to put @entity5 ’s first point of the day on the board and @entity1 coming from three down against @entity20 for the second			2
@entity22 has seen his leadership of the @entity10 team at the @entity7 criticised by one of his players @entity27 ( centre ) is a veteran of 10 @entity29 and laid into the way his captain ran things @entity33 hits @entity7 winner it was @entity36 @entity2 who delivered the winning point , and he did so in sensational fashion by hitting his approach to the 15th within a foot of the hole			1
' i ca n’t really put words to it			0
it is unbelievable ' said the 38 - year - old , moments after his clincher had prompted a handshake on the fairway between @entity5 ’s captain @entity53 and his opposite number @entity22			1
while @entity53 was quickly at the heart of ecstatic @entity5 celebrations and receiving lavish praise from his players , @entity22 was being derided by senior members of his own team			1
in one of the more extraordinary sporting press conferences , @entity27 outlined in detail how the @entity10 had failed to prepare for any @entity7 in a suitable fashion since they last won , at @entity64 in 2008			1
the captain then was @entity66 , who @entity27 said had got his team ' invested in the process ' and ' had a game plan '			1
the implication was @entity22 had done neither			2
@entity22 gestures to the crowd at the closing ceremony as @entity53 watches on from the sidelines @entity22 was criticised by not reverting to the successful formula used in 2008 's victory unconfirmed reports suggested another member of the @entity10 staff had been overheard talking about @entity22 in derogatory terms and questioning his selections			1
both @entity27 and @entity81 were dropped for the entirety of saturday and @entity81 admitted : ‘ it was a bummer			2
’ @entity27 : ' there were two things that allowed us to play our best that @entity66 did : one was he got everybody invested in the process			1
' he got everybody invested in who they were going to play with , who the picks were going to be , who was going to be in their pod , when they would play , and they had a great leader for each pod			0
' we hung out together and we were all invested in each other 's play			0
we were invested in picking @entity101 ( @entity102 ) that week , we were invested in the process			0
' the other thing that @entity53 did really well was he had a great game plan for us ; how we were going to go about doing this , how we were going to go about playing together , if so - and - so is playing well , if so - and - so is not playing well - we had a real game plan			2
' those two things helped us bring out our best golf			0
we use that same process in the @entity110 and we do really well			0
@entity27 wanted the tactics to be more along the lines of @entity66 's pod system @entity22 , @entity81 , @entity16 , @entity114 and @entity115 line up during the presentations e strayed from a winning formula in 2008 for the last three @entity29 and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best			1
' @entity27 was asked whether he thought his comments were disloyal to @entity22			2
' oh , i 'm sorry you 're taking it that way			0
i 'm just talking about what @entity66 did to help us play our best , ' was his response			0
' you asked me what i thought we should do to bring our best golf out and i 'd go back to when we played our best golf and try to replicate that formula			0
' as the @entity10 were in disarray , a @entity5 party at @entity133 was getting under way			1
‘ i was just so up for it , more so than i was in the two majors i won this year , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ there was no option other than to win			0
i played my best golf			0
’ it was a big contrast in reception at the end of the weekend as @entity22 took flak and @entity53 celebrated			1

@entity27 felt @entity22 should have replicated the tactics of 2008
@entity27 is a veteran of 10 @entity29 and was *disappointed* this time
in 2008 @entity66 's *imaginative* captaincy guided @entity10 to victory
at @entity133 , @entity5 *dominated* the foursomes to crush the @entity10
@entity22 admitted the @entity10 were *woeful* in the foursome format
@entity27 felt that @entity22 got major tactical choices *wrong*
on the other hand , @entity53 got big *decisions* right to claim the win
@entity22 admits that the @entity5 's ' *kicked* our ( @entity10 ) butts '
