by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:27 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 27 february 2013 @entity3 launched an extraordinary attack on the media yesterday for exposing the @entity7 scandal			1
the deputy prime minister accused journalists investigating a cover - up of being ‘ self - appointed detectives ’			2
his ill - judged remarks shocked @entity13 and @entity14 , who said he should focus on getting to the truth			1
ill - judged : @entity3 ( left ) launched an attack on journalists for exposing the @entity7 scandal			1
@entity19 ( right ) , a former @entity19 activist , went public with groping claims against @entity7 and @entity19 , a former @entity19 activist who went public with groping claims against @entity7 last week , said mr @entity3 was wrong to attack a ‘ free press regarded by most as important in a democracy ’			1
in another twist , the @entity24 has learnt that senior @entity19 were attempting to silence whistleblowers only this week			1
on monday , @entity27 , who was the party ’s director of operations at the height of the claims against @entity7 , made an ‘ aggressive ’ telephone call to a former party activist who claimed she saw the peer molesting a young woman a decade ago			1
he was apparently furious she had contacted this newspaper to complain that her allegations had been swept under the carpet			0
on another black day for the @entity19 : the affair started when former @entity19 activists went public with claims of sexual harassment against @entity7 , who retired as the party ’s chief executive in 2009 – ostensibly on health grounds			1
after initially denying he knew about the claims until shortly before three women made allegations on @entity50 , mr @entity3 admitted he had asked his then chief of staff @entity51 to probe ‘ non-specific concerns ’ about @entity7 in 2008			1
it has since emerged that mr @entity3 ’s office failed to act on specific and detailed allegations of misconduct by the peer made in 2010			1
@entity59 , the ex-frontbencher who raised her concerns with him , said : ‘ i spoke to @entity3 about general concerns			0
i did n’t know of any specific incidents and neither did he			0
’ peers : lord @entity27 introduced to the @entity65 ( left ) standing next to @entity7 ( right ) a spokesman for the deputy prime minister said : ‘ @entity59 did raise general concerns with @entity3 about @entity7 ’s conduct			1
she did not know of or raise specific allegations			0
as @entity3 has said , he was aware of general concerns which were acted upon by his then chief of staff @entity51			0
’ yesterday mr @entity3 , speaking outside his south - west @entity72 home , called for detectives who are now reviewing the claims to be allowed to do their job			1
he said : ‘ i understand there are many people who appear to want to act as self - appointed detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years ago			0
' but the only way that we are going to get to the bottom of the truth , the only way we are going to ensure that the women whose allegations were broadcast on television last week are properly listened to , the only way were are going to establish exactly what happened and who knew what and when , is by allowing the two investigations that i established immediately after the @entity50 broadcast to do their job and , indeed , to allow the police , whom we have now approached , to do their job as well			0
' and in the meantime i can not – and my party can not – provide a running commentary on every shred of speculation about events which happened many years ago			0
’ his intervention drew a stinging response from @entity109 , who wrote on @entity110 : ‘ @entity3 slams “ self - appointed detectives ” , otherwise known as the free press			2
regarded by most as important in a democracy			0
’ she added : ‘ they covered up a massive scandal , and now they do n’t want people asking questions			0
’ she also dismissed the idea that the allegations had been timed to damage the party leadership ahead of a crucial by - election in @entity125 , which will take place tomorrow			2
toward the end of last year , she and some of the other alleged victims of @entity7 ’s unwanted advances agreed to go public with their story , and told the party at the end of last month that they had done so			1
@entity134 , a @entity13 mp and member of the @entity137 , said : ‘ it is only through the power of the free press and tv that these allegations have come to light			2
instead of trying to divert attention by blaming journalists , @entity3 should be focusing on getting to the unvarnished truth			0
’ @entity147 , another @entity13 mp , said : ‘ only someone with the genius of @entity3 could have a sex scandal that does n’t involve sex and turn it into a leadership crisis			2
mr @entity3 would have to answer fewer questions from the press if he put out a statement that he could stick to about what he knew and when			2
’ @entity158 mp @entity157 , who wrote to police asking them to investigate , claimed mr @entity3 treated the @entity7 accusations as an issue of ‘ political management ’			1
‘ the real issue is why did n’t @entity3 and the @entity165 do the appropriate thing in dealing with this as serious allegation , rather than as political management , ’ he said			0
mr @entity3 ’s aides insisted he had not been attacking broadcasters in his remarks but rather @entity173 - supporting newspapers he believes are revelling in the scandal			1
at least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by @entity7 @entity7 yesterday dramatically denied @entity3 ’s claim that he had been confronted about sexual harassment allegations			1
as yet more senior party figures were dragged into the scandal , the peer at the centre of the claims categorically denied anyone had spoken to him about his conduct			0
but mr @entity3 ’s office insists cabinet minister @entity51 confronted @entity7 about rumours of unwanted advances to women @entity19 activists in 2008			1
in a statement on sunday , mr @entity3 said that mr @entity51 had ‘ put these concerns to @entity7 and warned him that any such behaviour was wholly unacceptable ’			1
but a spokesman for @entity7 insisted : ‘ in 27 years of working for the @entity19 he received no complaint or allegation about his behaviour			0
nor is he aware of any personal complaints being made in the three and a half years since he stood down as chief executive until last week			0
’ in an indication that the key players in the affair are beginning to turn against each other , sources close to mr @entity3 insisted @entity7 ’s meeting with mr @entity51 ‘ categorically did happen ’			1
one said : ‘ he raised the concerns that had been passed to him , that were non-specific , about @entity7 ’s behaviour			2
’ the deputy prime minister ’s aides also suggested for the first time that the peer did not stand down solely for health reasons in 2009 , as was publicly stated , but after pressure from mr @entity3 ’s office			1
‘ we did act , ’ said one			0
‘ @entity7 was spoken to , then in 2009 he was ill and he stood down			2
the timeline speaks for itself			0
’ in his statement @entity7 ’s spokesman said he ‘ refuted the allegations ’ that he had behaved inappropriately with as many as ten female activists			1
the spokesman added : ‘ he has been notified of an internal investigatory panel within the party			0
‘ the matter must now be regarded as sub judice pending its proceedings and no further statement will be issued in the interim			0
he expects others to respect the sub judice principle , and he notes that under the party rules concerned it is for any case made against him to be proved by evidence to the requisite standard			0
’ former @entity19 leader @entity19 suggested yesterday he and colleagues had ‘ all picked up the rumours ’ about @entity7 ‘ some time before ’ women went public with allegations of sexual harassment last week			2
but he insisted he did not hear any speculation about the peer ’s conduct while he was leader			0
and although one of the victims claimed allegations against @entity7 dated back as far as 2001 , @entity248 , who was party leader at the time , insisted he had never heard anything about them .			2
