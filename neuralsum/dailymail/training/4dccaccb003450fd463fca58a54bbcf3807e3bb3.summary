a mother has told of her heartbreaking victory in a landmark court case which allowed her to end the life of her severely disabled daughter			1
twelve - year - old @entity5 was born blind and unable to walk , talk , eat or drink unaided			1
she suffered from meningitis , septicaemia and fluid on the brain			0
before the right - to - die ruling – a first for a child without a terminal illness and not on life support – her mother @entity11 wrote in a statement to the court : ‘ my daughter is no longer my daughter			1
the light from her eyes is now gone and is replaced with fear and a longing to be at peace			0
’ miss @entity5 , 36 , added : ‘ today i am appealing to you for @entity5 as i truly believe she has endured enough			2
for me to say that breaks my heart			0
but i have to say it			0
’ the judge granted the request in august and @entity5 died 14 days later			1
her case saw @entity50 ’s @entity49 – which had provided her with round - the - clock care – fight on behalf of the girl ’s parents to give them the right to end her life			1
the ruling sets a precedent as it is the first time a child breathing on their own and not suffering from a terminal illness has been allowed to die			0
miss @entity5 , who had given up work as a nurse to be her daughter ’s carer , said : ‘ @entity5 was screaming and writhing in agony for 24 hours a day and it broke my heart to see her like that			1
‘ not being able to help her or ease her suffering was too much to bear			0
‘ she was n’t my angelic child any more , she was just a shell			0
i wanted to have beautiful memories of @entity5 , not soul - crushing ones			1
' doctors only discovered that ms @entity5 was carrying @entity75 two days before @entity5 was born			1
if they had known earlier , they could have easily treated the baby while she was in her mother 's womb after a routine operation went wrong , leaving her daughter in agonising pain , ms @entity5 and @entity5 's father , @entity79 ( right ) , took the decision to let her die @entity5 's quality of life was so poor that she depended on round - the - clock hospital care and was fed and watered through a tube she added : ‘ sitting at her bedside and holding her hand , it killed me that there was nothing i could do to help her			1
all of the nurses were in tears as they witnessed her screaming and doubling over in pain			0
‘ all i wanted was for my daughter to die with dignity with me by her side , holding her hand			2
’ two days before giving birth in july 2002 , @entity104 , from @entity105 , @entity106 , was told her daughter was likely to be severely ill as she carried @entity75			0
if caught early the condition is easily treatable in the womb with antibiotics , but the mother - to - be was told that as it had gone untreated , it would harm her unborn child			2
at ten days old , @entity5 had to have a shunt – a small tube with a valve – fitted to drain fluid in her brain			0
a high court judge ruled that @entity5 , pictured being held by her grandmother @entity118 , should have her fluids withdrawn the operation for kidney stones had left @entity5 ' screaming and writhing in agony for 24 hours a day ' , ms @entity5 said her illness was so severe doctors warned she would die before her fourth birthday			1
despite that outlook , @entity5 survived far beyond the age of four			2
but a routine operation in may 2012 to remove kidney stones left her with an infection and specialists told her parents there was nothing more they could do			1
she became immune to the strong pain relief cocktail of morphine and ketamine , leaving her in agony			0
it was then that her mother and father @entity79 met the ethics board at @entity49 to beg them to put an end to @entity5 ’s suffering			1
while doctors agreed to stop feeding her , they were not able to withdraw all fluids and said it could take months for her to die			2
after her fluids were withdrawn by doctors , it took two weeks for 12 - year - old @entity5 to die ms @entity5 misses her daughter every day , but says she knows it was ' the right thing to do ' heartbroken : ms @entity5 said the ' absolutely horrifying ' day her daughter died was the hardest of her life the hospital agreed to take @entity5 ’s case to the @entity159 , to argue that she deserved the right to a quicker , less painful death			1
on august 7 this year , mrs justice @entity162 read miss @entity5 ’s plea and declared it was in the mother and daughter ’s best interests to withdraw fluids			1
‘ the love , devotion and competence of her mother are apparent , ’ the judge said			0
‘ in her own closed world [ @entity5 ] has had some quality of life			2
‘ sadly that is not the case now			0
please can you tell @entity5 ’s mother that i have great admiration for her , and please express my deep condolences to her			2
’ @entity5 died two weeks later , on august 21 , with her family at her side			1
her mother said : ‘ the last day was the hardest of my life			0
‘ i miss my beautiful girl every day and although i know it was the right thing to do , i will never forgive myself			0
‘ it should n’t have to be a mother ’s decision to end their child ’s life			1
’ mr @entity79 , a 47 - year - old businessman , added : ‘ it was heartbreaking to see my daughter like that			2
@entity5 never spoke so we never knew how she felt			0
she could n’t tell us what she was going through and it was the hardest decision we ’ve ever made			0
