by @entity0 a new study has shown how fraudsters are able to use information shared online on social networks to build detailed profiles of potential victims			1
researchers interviewed one ex-offender to find out the techniques he and others use to garner details from online sources enabling them to steal others ' identities			1
he revealed that while users are often canny enough to withhold enough information on one site to foil fraudsters , resourceful crooks can collect enough data from various sources to apply for credit or make online purchases in their victim 's name			1
online predator : researchers interviewed one former offender to get an insight into how fraudsters gather information from individuals ' various online profiles to collect enough data to steal identities chief among the top three online resources for collecting potential victims personal details was not a social media website at all , but was in fact 192.com			1
the directory inquiries website was noted as particularly useful for providing information on where potential victims live , their age , other occupants , and how long they have lived there			2
fraudsters can then flesh out the skeleton identity this crucial data provides by using @entity49 for details on location , activities , friends and photographs ; and @entity57 , on which users often reveal their entire work and education history			1
‘ 192.com was such a good resource – the information on there was so good , ' the study 's interviewee revealed			1
' @entity57 is good – the whole point of the website is to get everything you ’ve done across to people you do n’t know			1
’ he added : ' photos are important			2
it can give you clues about a password or a security question – you may be asked favourite holiday place , or favourite football club – it ’s a piece of information			2
' whose checking your profile ? the research , conducted on behalf of online security company @entity81 , revealed fraudsters often mine @entity49 profiles for information that could help them crack passwords cyber-criminals are making $ 5million a year using computer viruses that hold the data on your hard drive to ransom			1
the scam has been around for several years , but new variants which claim to be the work of law enforcement agencies means the number of victims has soared			2
ransomware is now a major criminal industry , said @entity101 , the company behind anti-virus packages like @entity103			0
' if you look at the nature of the beast , it really puts the screws to you , ' said @entity109 , director of @entity101 's security response team			0
' we see so many gangs moving to ransomware , looking for new angles , new versions , that we 're going to see a lot of this in the future			0
' the malware infects a personal computer and cripples the machine			0
it can even encrypt its files			0
it then displays a message - the ransom note - that demands payment to restore control to the owner			0
' it 's an extortion racket , ' @entity101 said in a white paper on the topic			0
the ex-fraudster revealed how he would create fake @entity49 profiles using pictures of attractive women to contact men in an effort to get them to reveal sensitive personal information			1
' you ’ve got to get in to the minds of people – most guys will add a pretty face even if they did n’t know them , ' he said			0
' one of my victims , i nicked someone ’s phone , chose a pretty girl from a different social networking site , got some of her photos and made a profile on @entity49 and added a few random people			1
' this guy emailed me stuff , where he would be and what he was doing – he thought he had a chance with this fake person i had made up			2
he was giving me all this information but does n’t really know who i am			0
' on other occasions he merely hijacked the @entity49 identity of an existing person to get their contacts to reveal information			1
' people can hijack someone ’s @entity49 activity - i ’ve known it to happen , say someone is called @entity175 , you can set up a new account using the name @entity178 , copy their image and information to the new account and add their friends and have conversations with them on @entity49			1
' you can extract information , it 's an avenue to exploit to get bits of information			0

alternatively the offender could collate the details into a complete identity then sell them on to others to commit the fraud			0
the fraudster said he felt social networks and social media sites ' did n't care ' their services were being exploited by criminals			2
' the more popular they are with everybody the happier they are , ' he said			0
' i think the thing they are worried about is if it became public knowledge that people can get defrauded through using them , i do n’t think they would like it			0
' @entity199 , founder and ceo of @entity81 , told @entity233 that the application of ' common sense ' can help social media users protect themselves against the fraudsters out to steal their identity			2
