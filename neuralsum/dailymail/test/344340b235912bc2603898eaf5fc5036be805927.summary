if the general election were confined to voting by football fans , it looks like @entity4 might win by a landslide			1
@entity6 is the overwhelming colour across the @entity8 in terms of the party that governs clubs ' constituencies			1
the @entity13 trail some way behind , while the @entity15 have only seven clubs in constituencies where they hold power			1
so if may 's vote goes the same way as the one in 2010 , @entity4 would leave their rivals trailing in this alternative election			2
the @entity8 's political colours , based on the party holding each club 's constituency @entity27 ( left ) can claim that 18 of the 20 @entity29 clubs are in @entity4 consituencies ; but prime minister @entity31 may be concerned at the @entity13 ' lack of @entity33 in the top flight football has long been hailed as the game the working man enjoys watching from the terraces overall , @entity27 ’s party has mps in constituencies housing 55 of the 92 clubs in @entity44 ’s top four divisions			1
@entity31 ’s @entity45 have 29			0
only one club falls into independent hands : @entity48 , which holds @entity49 , voted @entity51 leader @entity50 as their mp in a 2012 by - election			2
at the top table , 18 of the 20 @entity29 grounds are in constituencies held by @entity4			1
only @entity58 , who voted @entity45 , fittingly blue , and @entity60 , where @entity15 hold sway , are any different			2
the research , undertaken by @entity63 , professor of parliamentary government at @entity65 , suggests football remains the working man ’s game , so long as @entity4 is the working man ’s party			1
both @entity71 clubs , @entity70 and @entity72 are all located in solid @entity4 seats			2
@entity74 , mp for @entity75 and @entity76 holding @entity77 , has nearly a 9,000 majority , while @entity79 , mp for @entity80 , the constituency housing the @entity82 , has around a 10,000 majority			0
@entity84 , encompassing @entity85 , is represented by @entity86 , who gained 20,000 more votes than anyone else at the 2010 general election			0
@entity86 mp ( left ) , of @entity84 , the constituency that contains @entity70 and @entity91 @entity58 are one of just two @entity29 clubs whose constituencies do not fall under @entity4 control			1
@entity99 ( right ) , conservative mp for @entity97 and @entity98 , is the only @entity45 mp in a top - flight team 's area @entity74 ( left ) , mp for @entity75 and @entity76 , which holds @entity105 's @entity77 ground , where @entity106 is captain of the @entity29 's biggest and most successful football club five years ago @entity109 won @entity110 , where the @entity111 is located , with a majority of 12,400			1
@entity58 and @entity98 , holding both @entity113 and @entity114 , voted in @entity45 @entity99 with a 16,700 majority			0
@entity116 is the only other constituency home to two clubs , both @entity119 and @entity120			0
the residents voted @entity4 by a 10,000 majority in 2010			2
@entity123 ( left ) is the brightest star at @entity72			0
@entity4 's @entity109 is the mp for @entity110 @entity79 ( left ) , @entity4 mp for @entity80 , can boast that @entity124 is in her constituency @entity4 dominate urban areas , so their supremacy on football terms is to be expected			1
the @entity45 , with their traditional rural support , are not the natural choice of many living near grounds			0
@entity134 ’s @entity133 seat does not include @entity136 ’s @entity135 , for example			0
@entity140 ’s @entity139 does not incorporate wednesday or @entity105 either			0
@entity27 is mp for @entity142 , but the @entity143 falls in @entity144 , a @entity4 stronghold nevertheless .			0

@entity29 clubs are overwhelmingly in @entity4 constituencies
*labour* hold seats in the majority of @entity8 clubs ' constituencies
the traditional view is that football is the working man 's game , while @entity4 is the party that was established to fight for the working man
just one @entity8 club , @entity161 , is in an independent constituency
football clubs are found in only seven @entity15 constituencies
