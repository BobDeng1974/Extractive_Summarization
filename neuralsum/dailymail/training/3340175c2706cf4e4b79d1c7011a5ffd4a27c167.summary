the veteran broadcaster despised his successor at @entity8 and supposedly heaped ‘ venom ’ upon him in a bid to derail his career			2
the feud only got worse when he became convinced that @entity1 had canned his special to mark the 25th anniversary of @entity15 ’s assassination			0
@entity16 : @entity1 , left , and @entity5 , right , had a famously strained relationship ; @entity5 is quoted as calling rather ' insincere ' succession : rather , right of centre , took over anchoring after @entity20 , centre , stepped down from the @entity22 in a withering judgement , @entity5 is quoted as saying : ‘ i think it ’s unfortunate that any other person feels about another as i do about @entity1			1
‘ but to me , i guess , @entity1 just reeks of insincerity			0
’ the claims reopen old wounds in the famously strained relationship between the two men , especially on the side of @entity5 who died in 2009 at the age of 92			1
he was replaced by @entity35 as the @entity8 evening news anchor in 1981 at the age of 65 in a mandatory retirement that became one of the most rancorous successions in tv history			0
according to @entity5 , the forthcoming biography by author @entity44 , problems really began in 1987 when @entity1 stormed off the set of the evening news when told he would lose his first 15 minutes of broadcast time because of the @entity49 tennis coverage			1
@entity5 told colleagues he would have fired him on the spot for such a public display of insubordination			1
news veteran : @entity5 , seen at the 1957 inauguration of @entity56 , was replaced by @entity1 as the @entity8 evening news anchor in 1981 at the age of 65 in a mandatory retirement that became one of the most rancorous successions in tv history rather says in the book : ‘ it was like he woke up in 1987 and saw me in his old job with successful ratings , making more money than he ever did - and i was relatively young to boot			1
old wounds : this and more is described in author @entity44 's upcoming biography of the news stalwart ‘ he wanted to destroy me			1
i did n’t know what to do			0
i kept wondering how to handle his venom			2
‘ i decided i did n’t want to fight him			2
so i hunkered down in the fetal position and just took it			1
’ @entity5 became ‘ more and more bitter toward the @entity1 regime ’ when he became convinced that @entity1 had spiked his proposed @entity15 special			1
rather tells the book that things ‘ escalated ’ but he was not to blame			0
he said : ‘ believe me , it was a complete non-starter from the get - go			0
‘ it was n’t … a serious consideration			0
but @entity5 created this false scenario that i had somehow nixed his @entity15 special			1
’ in an effort to quell the row , @entity8 executives signed @entity5 to a final 10 - year deal but ordered him to stop publicly criticising @entity1			1
matters were not helped however when it emerged @entity5 would lose his personal staff and that his salary was being was slashed by $ 850,000 a year to $ 150,000			1
the downgrade came on his 72nd birthday			0
the biography , extracts of which appeared in the @entity97 , is the latest salvo in the war between the two broadcasters			0
according to reports from the time , @entity1 completely snubbed @entity5 at the @entity103 even though he was waiting in a studio next door			2
' he wanted to destroy me			0
i did n't know what to do			0
i kept wondering how to handle his venom			0
' - @entity1 for his part @entity5 said that @entity1 ’s replacement @entity111 , who took over in 2005 should have done so sooner and that the new man was ‘ one of the great television journalists of our time ’			2
@entity5 said at the time : ‘ although @entity1 did a fine job , i would have liked to have seen ( @entity111 ) there a long time ago ’			2
@entity1 ’s comments in the biography are all the more surprising as he had been effusive in his praise for @entity1 when he died and said his ‘ admiration for his accomplishments never wavered			0
’ @entity5 was still alive when in 2006 @entity1 ’s career at @entity8 came to an end over his bungled 60 minutes ii report on @entity130 ’s national guard service .			2

@entity5 biography *paints* tense picture between two @entity135 anchors
rather said he ' hunkered down into the fetal position and just took it ' rather than fight @entity5 's ' venom '
