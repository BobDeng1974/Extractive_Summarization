by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 launched preparations for wednesday 's @entity5 semi-final against @entity6 with a game of bluff around @entity10 ’s fitness			0
@entity10 dislocated his shoulder during the goalless first leg and @entity2 confirmed last week the goalkeeper will require surgery to help repair the right shoulder joint			0
it is a routine procedure but one which would normally rule a player out for around three months , so it was a surprise to see @entity20 's no 1 among the first players out for tuesday ’s session at their training ground in @entity24			2
the big @entity63 goalkeeper could not lift his arms above his head and held his right arm close to his body for stability as he went through the gentlest of jogging exercises			0
when goalkeepers @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 broke off to do their work with goalkeeping coach @entity75 , @entity10 sat it out			1
he could be seen kicking a ball against a nearby goalpost as @entity75 worked the other three intensively			0
there were rumours last week that @entity10 might be convinced to delay surgery until after the end of the season in the hope he may be fit enough to play if @entity20 were to reach the @entity5 final on may 24 , against @entity87 or @entity88			1
understudy : @entity71 is most likely to continue in his role between the posts cheeky : but was @entity10 training all part of a mind - game ruse from @entity95 boss @entity2 ? who 's no 1 ? @entity20 keepers @entity71 , @entity10 , @entity73 and @entity72 warm up in charge : @entity2 looks on as his @entity20 charges are put through their paces when asked directly about this in his press conference on friday , @entity2 shrugged and said he did not know but the club is not likely to take a risk with such an important asset as their @entity107 goalkeeper			1
@entity71 remains most likely to continue in goal			2
the 41 - year - old @entity112 , on course to become the oldest player to appear in a @entity5 final , has yet to concede since coming off the bench to replace @entity10 in @entity6			1
he performed well at @entity115 on sunday when a weakened @entity20 blew the @entity117 title race wide open by beating the leaders 2 - 0			0
@entity20 ’s other fitness doubts were all present at tuesday ’s training session			2
@entity121 , who twisted an ankle in @entity6 last week , appeared happy and at ease as he trained			2
back in the mix : @entity121 trains with @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 central role ? @entity52 chats with @entity130 as he trains despite being a doubt for wednesday 's clash @entity53 , who has not played since tweaking a calf muscle in the second leg of the @entity5 quarter - final against @entity136 , also seemed to be moving freely			1
@entity20 have been cautious with @entity53 , wary that the slight injury might develop into something more serious but the 17 - goal @entity139 , voted @entity141 , has been such a key part of @entity2 ’s attacking plans this season that he is expected to play at @entity145 tomorrow			1
@entity52 who has missed the last two games with a minor knee injury was also fit to train and could return to lead the line			1
@entity2 knows his team will have to score if they are to reach their third @entity5 final			0
@entity52 has scored 12 this season , all at home			0
stayin ' alive ? @entity37 keeps his team - mates happy as they prepare a gameplan in action : suspended @entity127 on the ball as @entity30 and @entity121 ( left ) close him down			0

@entity10 says he is fit after injury but his movement was *restricted* at @entity160
the *31* - year - old sat out the intensive goalkeeper training
@entity71 set to continue in goal at @entity145
@entity121 looked happy and at ease during the session
hazard was also moving freely despite spell out injured
@entity52 could return to lead the line for @entity20
