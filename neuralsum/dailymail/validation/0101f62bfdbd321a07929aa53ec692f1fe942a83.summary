@entity0 , 70 , accepted he ' froze ' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion the police chief in charge during the @entity8 disaster has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the ' direct cause ' of the deaths of 96 @entity14 fans			1
@entity0 , 70 , accepted he ' froze ' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the @entity18 turnstile			1
the retired officer has already made a series of admissions about ' mistakes ' he made , confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised ' unreservedly ' to fans ' families			1
mr @entity0 was responding to questions from @entity28 , representing the @entity29 , during his sixth day of evidence at the new @entity8 inquests in @entity32 , @entity33			1
mr @entity34 reminded mr @entity0 of his earlier evidence to @entity36 , counsel for the inquest , about his state of mind after the opening of @entity40 when he told her : ' it was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step			1
my mind for a moment went blank			0
' asked again if he had ' froze ' , mr @entity0 said : ' it appears to be a distinct possibility			1
' mr @entity34 said : ' you know what was in your mind and i will ask just one last time			0
will you accept that in fact you froze ? ' ' yes sir , ' said mr @entity0			1
mr @entity34 went on : ' do you agree with the following , that people died in a crush in the central pens ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' yes sir			1
' mr @entity34 said : ' that if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred ? ' the witness repeated : ' yes sir			0
' the barrister continued : ' that closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy			0
' mr @entity0 said again : ' yes sir			1
' mr @entity34 went on : ' that failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the @entity8 tragedy			0
' mr @entity0 said : ' yes sir			1
' up to 2,000 fans entered @entity40 , with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which mr @entity0 had not ordered to be closed and then on to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing			1
he claimed he was unaware of the geography of @entity88 's ground , this being his first match in charge			0
mr @entity34 said : ' do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' i did not think of it on the day , sir , because of the pressure i was under			1
' the inquests have heard that mr @entity0 told the 1989 @entity103 into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were ' grave '			1
the inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend @entity8 was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back - up from dog - handlers around 2,000 fans poured in through @entity40 ( pictured ) , many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them , which had not been closed off by police he has told the jury that his serious failings were due to his lack of experience and that others also played their part in the cause of the deaths			1
mr @entity0 agreed with mr @entity34 that it was ' totally unacceptable ' that a match commander ' did not have a grip on the geography of that ground sufficient to enable you to understand the consequences of your decision making '			2
he also accepted that when giving evidence to @entity140 it appeared that he was aware that the congested @entity18 turnstiles did lead to the central tunnel			0
mr @entity0 said he did not want to go into detail about his ' personal circumstances ' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but he may have been ' confused ' when giving evidence in 1989			1
he said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the @entity150 overlooking the @entity18 terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them			0
but he accepted they had no received formal instructions to do so			0
@entity157 , representing mr @entity0 , outlined what he said were the three failures of his client that would exercise the jury			2
some 96 @entity14 fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded @entity18 terrace firstly , to prevent congestion building up to dangerous levels at the @entity18 turnstiles			0
secondly , the failure to delay the kick - off at any appropriate time and thirdly the ' most serious failure ' was that of failing to ensure the closing of the tunnel leading to the central pens			0
mr @entity175 went on : ' you accept you could have done more in the aftermath when it became obvious that there was a disaster unfolding			2
' ' yes sir , ' said mr @entity0			2
mr @entity175 continued : ' but you do not accept that officers in front of the pens needed any specific direction in relation to the task of getting injured supporters out of the pens			0
' mr @entity0 said : ' that is correct , sir			2
' mr @entity175 said : ' i think the reason in your view is they would have exercised their natural wish to save life and limb ? ' ' yes , ' replied the witness			0
mr @entity0 agreed with mr @entity175 that it was his belief he had declared a major incident but accepted there was no record of such a direction			2
he also accepted that an experienced match commander ' probably would not have made at least some or perhaps any of those mistakes '			2
mr @entity0 agreed that he ' buried his head in the sand ' following the tragedy			2
at the @entity103 weeks after the disaster he was asked about his reaction when he was told shortly before the hearing that he probably needed separate legal representation from @entity214			1
a young @entity14 fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the @entity8 pitch he told the jury : ' i felt destroyed			0
i was quite shocked and extremely disappointed			0
' i was of the view that that i was being represented by mr @entity222 ( then @entity223 for @entity214 ) and probably i was a little naive			0
in all honesty it gave me no confidence whatsoever to think that i was walking into @entity140 's inquiry somewhat naked , shall i say			0
' mr @entity0 agreed with his barrister that it was only in recent times that he had been able to come to terms with his mistakes and make the admissions he made to the jury last week			1
asked whether he had found it easy to admit his ' professional failings which led to the deaths of 96 innocent men , women and children ' , mr @entity0 said : ' it has been the most difficult period of my life			2
' the jury heard he had not revealed his mistakes to officers from @entity246 - the ongoing criminal investigation into the disaster - when he was interviewed last march under criminal caution in relation to ' serious criminal offences '			2
mr @entity175 asked : ' rightly or wrongly , did you feel that was a good time to be making the admissions and the apologies that you have made over the last week ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' i did n't think it was the right time , sir			1
' he told his barrister that in the lead up to the @entity103 no senior officer had told him he should accept at least some responsibility for the deaths , and that he had even gone on to command two matches at @entity8 after the disaster			1
the jury was told by mr @entity0 that @entity214 was not accepting any responsible for the disaster at the time the @entity103 began			1
mr @entity175 said : ' to what extent did you mr @entity0 , as it were , go along with that corporate line from on high ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' sir , i was an employee of @entity214			2
' mr @entity175 told the inquests that his client did in fact apologise at @entity140 for giving misleading remarks about the opening of the gates and that fans were to blame for causing disorder			0
supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the @entity284 gates in @entity14 after the disaster in 1989 the barrister reminded the jury that mr @entity0 had told the @entity140 inquiry : ' my deepest sympathy goes out to them			1
i can not say enough on that matter			0
' mr @entity175 asked his client : ' did that reflect that you were unable to then properly put into words how you were feeling ? ' ' yes sir , ' said mr @entity0			0
mr @entity175 continued : ' you understand why the delay in providing a more gracious and more full apology has caused to many both offence and distress ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' i fully understand , sir			0
' he said he had been in a state of denial and had been drinking heavily ahead of @entity140 's inquiry following @entity140 's interim findings on the tragedy in early august , mr @entity0 was suspended from duty on august 4 , 1989			1
he was later medically retired on november 10 , 1991			0
the witness will return to give evidence tomorrow			0
