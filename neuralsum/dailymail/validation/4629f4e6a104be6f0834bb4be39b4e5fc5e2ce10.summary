a father - of - two who plastered stickers which said ' halal is barbaric and funds terrorism ' on supermarket chicken has insisted he is an animal rights activist and not racist			1
@entity6 , 29 , walked into a @entity8 's store in @entity9 , @entity10 , with the # @entity12 stickers and stuck them on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle			1
he was stopped by security and , after police were called , officers searched his home and found cannabis and a letter addressed from the @entity23 of @entity24 which made reference to an ' anti-jihadi frog '			1
' however , he has insisted he is an animal rights activist and that the incident was not racially - aggravated @entity10 @entity38 heard how there was also reference that he had browsed @entity40 on his home computer			1
@entity6 , of @entity9 , admitted criminal damage in relation to the supermarket incident on february 18 and possession of cannabis			1
however , he denied that he was ' racially motivated ' when he carried out the attack on the supermarket chicken and will face trial in july over the charge			1
it emerged that Â£ 16.50 worth of chicken had to be destroyed as a result of his actions			0
at the court hearing today , it was said that he was simply drawing attention to the ' inhumane ' halal methods of animal slaughter , which involves slitting the animal 's throat to allow the blood to drain out			2
@entity63 , prosecuting , said : ' the defendant has gone to the supermarket and placed stickers on packets of chicken saying ' halal is barbaric and funds terrorism '			2
the chicken had to be destroyed because the stickers could not be removed			2
' he says he wished to draw attention to the inhumane halal methods of animal slaughter and that was his motivation rather than racial prejudice			0
' the point about animal cruelty could be expressed in a different way without the suggestion that halal and terrorism are linked			2
' @entity6 ( pictured outside @entity83 today ) admitted criminal damage in relation to the supermarket incident but denied that he was ' racially motivated '			1
he also admitted possession of cannabis @entity6 plastered the stickers on meat , signs in the chilled goods aisle and even on supermarket trollies @entity10 @entity38 was told that @entity6 was simply drawing attention to the ' inhumane ' halal methods of animal slaughter , which involves slitting the animal 's throat to allow the blood to drain out @entity99 , defending , said @entity6 was protesting against halal slaughter and the reference to terrorism in the stickers referred neither to race nor religion			1
he said : ' he uses the word terrorism but that ca n't denote race or indeed religion			0
' bailing him until a further hearing on july 23 , district judge @entity110 added : ' you have pleaded guilty to some matters but not guilty to the racially - aggravated criminal damage			1
there will have to be a trial			0
' judge @entity110 told @entity6 that the conditions of his bail including not going near the @entity8 's supermarket in @entity9			2
halal involves cutting through arteries in the neck halal halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade , while a @entity129 butcher recites a religious verse			0
all blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under @entity135 law			0
under @entity135 law , an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious			0
@entity138 in comparison , the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed			0
it means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death , as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn - out pain and suffering			0
once the animal has been killed at the abattoir , it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered			0
