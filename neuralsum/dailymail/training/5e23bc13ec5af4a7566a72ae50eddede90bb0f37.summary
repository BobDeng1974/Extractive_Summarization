by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 01:57 est , 25 october 2012 women should freeze their eggs when they hit 30 as an ‘ insurance policy ’ for having babies later on , according to researchers			1
anyone who has n’t met mr @entity7 - or is intent on pursuing their career - should consider paying up to £ 5,000 to ‘ bank ’ their eggs			1
not only will their chances of having babies be higher , say researchers from the @entity15 , they will also save money as they wo n’t have to pay for @entity17 later in life			1
women who freeze their eggs at 30 and have them reinserted ten years later are five times more likely to get pregnant in @entity24 , the cost of removing and freezing a woman ’s eggs can be as high as £ 5,000 in addition to an annual fee of £ 200 for every year they are stored			1
but the academics have calculated that if women wait until they are 40 before trying for children , they may need several rounds of @entity17 which will cost double this amount			2
and by this stage there is no guarantee they will ever become pregnant - even with @entity17 - as their eggs are of far poorer quality			1
the researchers claim if these women were to freeze their eggs aged 30 and then have them re-inserted ten years later , their chances of having a baby would be five times greater			1
the experts have worked out that a 40 - year - old woman who uses eggs frozen when she was 30 has a 75 per cent chance of falling pregnant			1
this compares to a 40 - year - old on @entity17 who has less than a 15 per cent chance			2
at present very few women in @entity24 bank their eggs unless they are about to undergo cancer treatment dr @entity53 , from the @entity54 , the research agency of the @entity57 ’s @entity56 , said : ‘ you take a 30 - year - old lawyer - she knows that she wants children someday but she ’s getting concerned because she knows that ten years goes by before she ’s in that position			1
‘ so her options at that point are to freeze eggs or not to freeze eggs			2
’ addressing the @entity67 ’s conference in @entity68 , she added : ‘ if you ’re sure you ’re not going to get pregnant until you ’re 40 , the younger the better			0
‘ so long as you freeze your eggs before 35 you have a 75 per cent chance of having a live birth			0
’ but she added that if a woman ‘ took her chances ’ and waited until she was 40 to try for a baby , she may need several cycles of @entity17 - each costing at least £ 3,000 - before she was successful			2
at present very few women in @entity24 bank their eggs unless they are about to undergo cancer treatment as it can damage their reproductive system			2
the process involves them firstly being given high doses hormones – called gonadotropins – to stimulate their ovaries and make them produce high numbers of eggs			0
once the eggs have reached a certain size , they are removed via a fine needle and placed in liquid nitrogen which freezes them at @entity95 ( -320f )			0
normally between 10 and 12 eggs are stored at a time – by law in @entity24 they can only be kept for a maximum of ten years			1
but the procedure is relatively new in @entity24 and only a handful of babies have been born from frozen eggs – the first was in 2002			1
the exact numbers are not known but it is believed to be fewer than ten			0
nonetheless research shows that rising numbers of women in their 20s and 30s are considering the option			0
a woman undergoing @entity17 treatment at 40 has less than 1 15 per cent chance of getting pregnant only last month a poll of 3,000 women aged 28 to 45 by @entity120 magazine found a fifth had considered freezing their eggs for use later on			1
@entity123 academic dr @entity122 backed the idea and said women were increasingly waiting until their late 30s before trying for a baby			0
by the time they realised they need @entity17 they may well be 40 by which time success rates are ‘ really low ’ he added			0
@entity134 , of the group comment on @entity136 warned that in rare cases , egg freezing can cause fatal blood clots			0
she said : ‘ @entity140 is a very uncomfortable invasive process , and can actually go seriously wrong			0
‘ keep searching is my advice and spend the money on finding mr @entity7 rather than enriching the @entity17 providers			0
’ dr @entity53 added that some women would never need to use their frozen eggs as they may decide to have babies a couple of years later - having met mr @entity7 or deciding to put career on hold			1
‘ obviously some women will never need to use their eggs			0
this is just an insurance policy of sorts			2

women who freeze their eggs at 30 and have them reinserted years later will have a higher chance of getting pregnant
at a cost of £ 5,000 , it could work out *cheaper* than @entity17 which has a much lower success rate
the practice if relatively new in @entity24 - with less than 10 babies conceived from a frozen egg
researchers say it *'s* an ' insurance policy of sorts ' until women meet ' mr right '
