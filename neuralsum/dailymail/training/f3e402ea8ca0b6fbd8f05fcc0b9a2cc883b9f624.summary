by @entity0 until recently , robotic arms were the stuff of comic books and cartoons , but that 's about to change as more companies develop systems designed to give us extra limbs			1
roboticists at the @entity11 have created robotic arms that lift heavy objects , grab things out of the wearer 's reach and can be used to hold objects steady			1
meanwhile , engineers at @entity19 have created a similar system that gives wearers superhuman strength			1
the two systems are a cross between those used by @entity26 villain @entity26 , or @entity26 , and @entity27			1
they weigh around 10lbs ( 9kg ) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips there were built at the institute 's @entity35 by @entity37 and @entity38 , both in the @entity39			1
the extra limbs created by @entity11 weigh around 10lbs ( 9kg ) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips , but can still lift heavy objects			2
the shoulder and hip - mounted limbs , created by @entity11 , weigh around 10lbs ( 9kg ) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips			1
the arms are designed to streamline tasks , give humans an extra pair of hands and become an extension of their own body			2
while they may not use mind control , they can learn from the way a person ’s body moves			0
in a video demonstration , the arms are shown to mimic a person ’s movements , but could one day have a mind of their own			2
meanwhile , @entity19 's arms are undergoing tests in @entity67			2
the exoskeleton fits anyone between 5ft 2in ( 1.6 metres ) and 6ft tall ( 1.85 metres )			0
it has a three - hour battery life , and the prototype can lift almost five stone in weight			0
while they may not use mind control , they can learn from the way a person ’s body moves			0
in a video demonstration , the arms are shown to mimic a person ’s movements , but could one day have a mind of their own so they could come to a wearer ’s aid if they needed an extra hand			2
meanwhile , @entity19 's arms are undergoing tests at the firm 's @entity92 facility in @entity67			0
the exoskeleton fits anyone between 5ft 2in ( 1.6 metres ) and 6ft tall ( 1.85 metres )			0
the 56lb ( 28kg ) frame of carbon , aluminium alloy and steel supports itself and is designed to follow the wearer 's movements			1
it has a three - hour battery life , and the prototype can lift almost five stone in weight			0
padded straps at the thigh , waist and chest connect the user to the suit			0
hydraulic joints and electric motors running up the outside of the legs link this system to a backpack , which powers and controls the rig			0
the shoulder - mounted arms ( pictured left ) were built at the institute 's @entity35 by @entity37 and @entity38			1
meanwhile , @entity19 's arms are undergoing tests at the firm 's @entity92 facility in @entity67 ( pictured right )			0
they can lift more almost five stone ( 30kg ) in weight the @entity11 arms ( prototype pictured left and right , and illustration pictured centre ) are designed to streamline tasks , give humans an extra pair of hands and become an extension of their own body			1
one day they could have a mind of their own to anticipate the wearer 's needs , claim the researchers as these drawing show , @entity11 ’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton , which can give humans super-human strength , but could probably be used in the near future and be cheaper than full body suits @entity11 's arms are different to others developed , such as the @entity152 ’s @entity151 arm , as they can move independently of a human ’s			1
the @entity151 arm could help its wearer carry an additional 40lbs ( 18 kg ) that is around the weight of a four - year - old child and make it feel easy as lifting a cup of tea			0
but it can not deviate from a human ’s own arm to anticipate their actions			0
@entity11 ’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton , which can give humans super-human strength , but they could probably be used in the nearer future and be cheaper than full body suits			2
so many possibilities : the @entity11 arms could also be used to help people climb tall structures the systems developed at @entity11 and @entity19 are a cross between those used by @entity26 villain @entity26 , or @entity26 ( pictured left ) and @entity27 ( pictured right ) at the moment , @entity11 's prototype arms could be used to open a door , leaving a human wearer 's hands free to carry shopping bags , for example			1
but in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance ( illustrated ) ' the extra limbs will help them hold objects , support the human body , share a workload and streamline the execution of a task , ' the @entity11 engineers said			1
' if the movements of such supernumerary limbs are tightly coupled and coordinated with their arms , the human users may come to perceive the extra limbs as an extension of their own body			2
' the overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body , working closely with the wearer			0

the shoulder - mounted system was created at @entity11 's @entity35
it was designed as an extension of the wearer 's own limbs and can also be worn on the hips
this frees up their hands to perform tasks , while limbs hold objects in place
arms mimic a wearer 's movements but could one day anticipate actions to hold doors open for humans with their hands full , for example
they *'re* a cross between @entity233 villain @entity26 and @entity27
@entity235 has a similar design that gives wearers superhuman strength
