it is understood that he is one of 64 prisoners who have been cleared for release and will be released in the next couple of months			1
insiders from within the @entity15 administration indicated earlier this week that the president would like to reduce the number of prisoners at the camp from 132 to 68 as soon as possible			1
and mr @entity1 , 46 , is among those who will be freed after no longer being deemed a threat , the @entity29 has reported			1
@entity32 , mr @entity1 's lawyer , told the newspaper that he believes his client will be returned to @entity11			1
he said : ' i can not believe they will not include @entity1 , as it would be totally irrational			2
it 's very hard for them to come up with an explanation as to why this has n't been done '			0
there had been debate as to whether mr @entity1 , who is a @entity44 citizen , would be able to return to @entity11 , but mr @entity45 has said that he will accept him back			2
the move to release more prisoners is the latest step in the president 's gradual push to close the facility by the time he leaves office in 2017			1
there has been a recent trickle of releases			0
the @entity56 said last week that four @entity57 held for over a decade at @entity12 have been returned to their home country			0
and six prisoners were transferred to @entity60 earlier this month			0
@entity12 was opened by @entity15 's predecessor , @entity61 , after the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity5 , to house terrorism suspects rounded up overseas			1

above , with two of his children in a shocking revelation written in the @entity72 earlier this month , mr @entity1 said that he has been beaten and starved of sleep and food while being held at @entity12			2
lawyers say he is still being held at the @entity5 base in @entity6 only because intelligence officials fear he will expose more evidence of torture by the @entity80			1
mr @entity1 claims he was in the room when a detainee called @entity83 was being abused in the presence of @entity11 intelligence officers			2

he insisted that he was in @entity57 to work for an @entity91 charity but the @entity92 said he was a senior @entity93 operative			0
