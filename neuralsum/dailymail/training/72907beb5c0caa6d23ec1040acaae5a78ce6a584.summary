capped off : jobless families should only receive benefits for two children , @entity4 chairman @entity3 said child - related benefits for the jobless should be capped at two children , the @entity4 party chairman declared last night			1
the move would put them in the same position as working parents who can not afford to have large families , @entity3 argued			1
unemployed parents who then choose to have more than two children ‘ will know that welfare is not going to fund that choice ’			1
as the government ’s £ 26,000 - a - year benefits cap for the out - of - work took effect yesterday , mr @entity3 insisted further radical reforms to welfare were back on the table			1
in another proposal , the minister said under - 25s who are unemployed should be denied housing benefit , so they have to live with their parents rather than be funded by the taxpayer to move to a place of their own			1
he said this would end the current ‘ bizarre incentive ’ that makes it easier for jobless youngsters to move out , than for those who have to work and save in order to afford to do so			0
mr @entity3 insisted the plans could be implemented in this @entity37 , despite @entity39 opposition			1
families living off benefits are currently unfairly freed from the decisions faced by millions of working people , he argued			1
more than 12,000 people have moved into work after being told about the new benefits cap , the @entity17 said			2
the limit now means couples and lone parents in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 can not receive more than £ 500 a week , while a £ 350 limit applies to single people			0
mr @entity3 said the @entity55 were now examining further reforms			2
by far the most controversial is that unemployed parents with two children could not be given any more support if they decide to have another child			1
under the plan , child benefit , income support or tax credits could be withheld for the extra children			1
two 's the limit : the @entity4 chairman suggested that those who are out of work should only receive benefits for two children to put a stop to ' @entity71 ' mr @entity3 also said housing benefit could be removed from 380,000 people under 25 , meaning they must join the growing number of young working adults whose financial circumstances force them to continue to live with their parents into their late 20s and 30s			1
the reform would save £ 1.8billion			0
it is understood @entity82 @entity81 has requested time to legislate for more changes in next year ’s parliamentary session			2
chancellor @entity86 could reduce the new £ 500 - a - week cap on benefits if it proves effective in reducing the welfare bill and encouraging work			1
the controversial annual limit on total household income from a range of benefits was introduced yesterday at the level of the average salary of £ 26,000 , amid claims that it will force many families into hardship			1
but conservative @entity100 want it cut further to £ 20,000 as part of an assault on welfare spending if @entity55 win the 2015 general election			1
the move would open up a political dividing line with @entity39 coalition partners , who have acted as a brake on @entity4 ambitions to slash back the welfare state			2
an aide confirmed that mr @entity86 had received representations on lowering the cap , adding : ' we want to see how the policy beds in			1
but clearly over time , lowering the cap is an option			0
' ‘ welfare should not be a way of life , ’ mr @entity3 said			2
‘ a lot of people worry that the way welfare operated under the last government meant claimants were free from taking the difficult decisions you would take if you are in work – none more starkly obvious than when you have children			0
‘ if you are a working family and you have another child , you know it ’s going to mean quite a severe impact on your living costs			2
yet in the welfare system , it ’s almost turned on its head , so additional children are actually recognised , with no limit			0
‘ we need to create a choice for people on welfare which mirrors that which millions of people in work who are n’t receiving state support have to make			0
it ’s only fair to the taxpayer			0
’ mr @entity3 said the limit could not be applied retrospectively , adding : ‘ you would have to say to families with two or more children who go on to have more after that date that they would not get further support			1
‘ it ’s something i would like to see done , or at least considered , in this @entity37			0
' it would send a strong signal to hard working people in this country that we are on their side			0
’ on housing benefit , he said : ‘ a young person who ’s out of work is given an advantage over a young person who ’s in work when it comes to moving away from their parents because of housing benefit			1
further changes : it is believed @entity81 has requested time to legislate for more changes to the benefits system in next year ¿ s parliamentary session ‘ so there ’s a bizarre incentive which means if you ’re not in work you can more easily move out and get your own place			1
this is a matter of basic fairness			0
’ he also attacked @entity191 ’s ‘ absolutely unbelievable ’ position on welfare reform			0
‘ they voted against all our legislation on benefit reform , then suggested they were in favour in some of it after all , and now as it comes in they seem to be against it again , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
@entity191 ’s welfare spokesman @entity203 insisted ministers ‘ need to give us a cap that is different in @entity205 to the rest of the country because rents in @entity205 are that much higher ’			0
but former @entity191 welfare minister @entity210 urged his party to accept the £ 26,000 cap immediately			1
he said @entity191 was ‘ struggling to establish some general principles which taxpayers will support with their money ’			0
‘ the key thing is whether in fact people should get more money , and sometimes considerably more money , than if they were actually working , and that ’s the principle that the government has actually introduced , ’ mr @entity210 said			0
‘ @entity191 ’s job , i think , is to accept this cap and move on quickly to a proactive policy			0
’ meanwhile a report by the ‘ @entity226 ’ of @entity4 @entity100 argued welfare payments for teenage mothers may encourage them to get pregnant so they can get their own flats			2
it suggests they should instead be supported by their parents or given supervised hostel accommodation			0
@entity236 presenter @entity235 accused the minister of having ' beliefs ' which were not borne out by the facts @entity81 yesterday accused the @entity236 of using ‘ politically motivated ’ interviewees to criticise government welfare cuts			1
the @entity82 spoke out after @entity236 news programme today featured a female protester who was planted by an anti-cuts group			2
he clashed with presenter @entity235 on air as the @entity236 covered the roll out of the £ 26,000 - a - year cap on benefits			1
an interview with a mother - of - three called @entity252 claimed she would be nearly £ 100 a week worse off			2
yesterday it was revealed she is a 36 - year - old from @entity205 , who arrived in @entity255 from the @entity256 in 1998			0
yet there was no mention in the @entity236 report that the case study had been supplied by the pressure group @entity261			2
mr @entity81 levelled the charge of bias as he was quizzed by mr @entity235 about his claim that 8,000 people had already come off benefits because of the cap , which was trialled in four @entity205 boroughs			1
mr @entity235 said the @entity269 had found the claims to be ‘ unsupported by the official statistics ’			0
but mr @entity81 hit back : ‘ you ca n’t disprove what i said either			2
i believe this to be right			0
i believe that we are already seeing people go back to work who were not going to go back to work until they were short of the cap			0
’ he added : ‘ what you ’re doing , as always in the @entity236 , you ’re seeking out lots of cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong			0
’ the @entity236 last night insisted its political coverage is ‘ fair , accurate and impartial ’ .			0
