a second ice cream company has recalled all of its products after health officials found listeria in a sample of its frozen treats			1
@entity8 of @entity9 said on its website on thursday that it is recalling its frozen products after the listeria discovery			1
in an online statement , @entity13 's said it is taking the voluntary precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety			1
the company is recalling its ice creams , frozen yogurts , sorbets , and ice cream sandwiches and closing retail stores until its products are ' ensured to be 100 per cent safe '			1
the @entity50 @entity49 found the listeria in a sample of @entity13 's ice cream it had randomly collected at a @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity50			1
' we will be working with our suppliers to determine if the bacteria was introduced by one of the ingredients we use , ' @entity57 , the company 's ceo said in a statement			2
' we will not reopen the kitchen until we can ensure the safety of our customers			2
' @entity13 's said the recalled ice cream was distributed in the @entity69 to retail outlets , including food service and grocery stores , as well as online at @entity74			1
on @entity76 , the company wrote that they are taking this precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety the recall includes all products bearing the brand name ' @entity13 's			1
' the action follows a similar recall by @entity86 - based @entity85 on monday night			1
@entity85 's ice cream was linked to ten listeria illnesses in four states , including three deaths , and listeria was found in several of the company 's products			1
the company is the third largest ice cream manufacturer in the @entity69 and sells its products in 23 states			1
it said it ' ca n't say with certainty ' how the bacteria was introduced to the manufacturing line , @entity85 's chief executive @entity98 said in a statement			1
' we 're committed to doing the 100 percent right thing , and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe , ' @entity98 said			2
on monday , @entity86 - based @entity85 creameries issued a voluntary recall for all of its products on the market on monday night after two samples of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream tested positive for listeriosis just last month the family - owned creamery issued its first recall in its 108 - year history after the @entity121 linked ice cream contaminated with listeriosis to three deaths at a @entity126 hospital			1
five others in @entity126 and @entity86 were sickened with the disease			0
the foodborne illness was tracked to a production line in @entity131 , @entity86 , and later to a second line in @entity133 , @entity134			0
the recalls are uncommon : listeria is n't usually found in ice cream , since the bacteria ca n't grow at freezing temperatures			1
a spokesman for the @entity141 said the agency has no evidence , for now , that the listeria found in @entity13 's ice cream and the listeria found in @entity85 ice cream are connected			1
' at this time , the @entity141 does not believe that the finding of listeria in one sample of @entity8 is related to the outbreak and recall associated with @entity85 , ' said spokesman @entity152			1
' we are continuing to investigate both situations and will provide updated information to consumers as we learn more			0
' the @entity121 said there are no known illnesses linked to @entity13 's products			1
@entity160 generally only affects the elderly , people with compromised immune systems , pregnant women and their newborn infants also on thursday , @entity85 said it will close its facilities in @entity86 , @entity134 and @entity167 for intensive cleaning			2
the creameries will be closed next week and possibly into the following week			2
the @entity141 said it still has open investigations in all three plants and will evaluate @entity85 's progress in removing listeria from the plant and its products			1
@entity85 did produce some ice cream in its plants this week , but that product will be used for testing and data gathering and wo n't be sold to the public , the company said			1
@entity160 generally only affects the elderly , people with compromised immune systems , pregnant women and their newborn infants			0
it can cause fever , muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms			0
the worst cases are fatal			0
the bacteria is found in soil and water that can be tracked into a facility or carried by animals			2
it can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility , partly because it grows well in refrigeration			0
it is commonly found in processed meats , unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk , and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak			2
what is @entity160 ? @entity160 is a hardy bacteria found in soil and water that can be tracked into a plant or carried by animals			0
it can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility , partly because it grows well in refrigeration			0
it is commonly found in processed meats , unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk , and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak			2
it is less well - known than other pathogens like salmonella and @entity224 , which cause many more illnesses in tainted food every year			0
but one in five people who get sick from listeria can die			0
the people who get sick from listeria are often already weaker and more vulnerable to disease			0
what are the symptoms ? when a person contracts the disease , it can cause fever , muscle aches , gastrointestinal symptoms and even death			0
am i at risk ? @entity160 generally only affects the elderly , people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women			0
it can cause miscarriage , stillbirth and premature labor for women and serious illness or death in newborn babies			0
healthy , younger adults and most children can consume listeria with no ill effects or only mild illness			0
how can i protect against listeria ? in the case of the ice cream and hummus recalls , there is nothing you can do to prevent it — just throw away the food if you learn it has been recalled			1
with fruit , scrubbing is never a bad idea , but it may not rid produce of all contaminants			0
in the case of the cantaloupe , the listeria likely hid on the fruit 's thick , rough skin			2
health officials think people may have been sickened when people cut into their cantaloupes , bringing listeria on the outside of the fruit to the inside			0
always clean surfaces that come into contact with food with hot , soapy water			0
the government says the listeria bacteria can be killed by heating food to 165 degrees @entity293 or until it is steaming hot just before serving it			0
