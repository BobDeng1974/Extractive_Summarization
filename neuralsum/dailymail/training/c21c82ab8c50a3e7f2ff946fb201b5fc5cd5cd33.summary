the girlfriend who was ' beside herself ' called police after speaking to his ' kidnapper ' on the phone and receiving a number of text messages			2
more than a dozen officers began an urgent investigation , which included house to house enquiries , checking @entity36 and analysing mobile phone data in a bid to find him			1
