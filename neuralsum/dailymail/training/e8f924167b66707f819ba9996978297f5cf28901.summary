by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam for a man who did so much good work in cricket , @entity2 should have known when to play with a straight bat			1
for a man who held an international rally driving licence for six years , he should have known when to swerve			2
but @entity2 has crashed this time			1
the ball has gone through the grille			0
from the 11 years he spent at the @entity12 ’ association to his six at the helm of the @entity13 , not many in either sport speak of his mistakes because there are n’t many			1
he is respected , he trumpets the causes most would agree with and , generally , has succeeded in modernising two organisations that needed it			0
resignation : @entity22 said that @entity2 's position is now untenable and the @entity13 boss should resign texts : the @entity13 described @entity27 's messages to @entity28 as ‘ friendly text message banter ’ his default position has been to support his members , which in the majority of cases in a trigger - happy sport has been the right course of action			1
but his organisation has taken a big risk in the case of @entity27			2
far from helping @entity27 ’s situation , the statement from @entity2 ’s organisation made it worse , if possible			1
the extent of @entity2 ’s involvement in the statement is not known			1
but the end product is way out of kilter with his background			0
he is a well - educated man , an astute politician of sport			0
he went to the prestigious @entity53 , whose alumni include @entity55 and @entity56			0
his profiles variously point to him competing in three @entity58 , as well as windsurfing , playing football and cricket to a high amateur standard and golfing to a handicap of six			2
but in sports administration he has made his name			0
people in cricket talk of a tough , streetwise negotiator who shaped up the @entity70			0
he was the statesmanlike figure guiding the @entity73 team in their decision to boycott a tour of @entity76 in 2003			0
his work to help former cricketers who fell on hard times should also be noted			0
he has made errors since taking over the @entity13 in 2008 , but he has also spoken a lot of sense , questioning the consequences of transfer windows and calling for the @entity85 to hold more power over the @entity87			1
well - eductaed : @entity2 , pictured with @entity88 , has made mistakes at the @entity13 but has also spoken sense his work has been motivated by a desire to protect managers , who obviously need it at a time when only 16 of the 92 clubs have retained their boss since the 2011 calendar year			1
‘ telling people , “ it ’s fine , get a mortgage ” and the following week sacking them is something that they can not do , ’ @entity2 said earlier this year			2
sadly , what his organisation said about @entity27 ’s situation made far less sense .			2
