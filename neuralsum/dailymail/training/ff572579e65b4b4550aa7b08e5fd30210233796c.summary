a mother who was told to have an abortion because her baby ’s chance of survival was so low has given birth to @entity7 ’s only ‘ double dwarf ’			1
@entity8 , who is three months old , was born healthy and fit to @entity9 , 24 , and her fiancé , @entity8 , 34 , both of whom have restricted growth			1
both of the parents have different forms of dwarfism and the new arrival has stunned medical experts by inheriting both types			2
as a result , his mother has hailed him a ' double dwarf '			1
baby @entity8 is believed to be the only person in the @entity7 with two forms of dwarfism			1
his parents , @entity28 and @entity9 , both have different types of dwarfism and the baby inherited both though doctors do not yet know what impact it will have on the baby they say there is no reason to believe he wo n’t lead a relatively normal life			1
ms @entity9 , from @entity42 , said that his safe arrival was a huge relief after she was advised early in the pregnancy that the baby may only survive half an hour , if born alive			1
doctors told her to consider an abortion after irregularities in scans caused professionals to worry the youngster had inherited a deadly combination of genes			2
but ms @entity9 , who had complications throughout the pregnancy , ignored advice and decided to carry on with the pregnancy			1
@entity28 's parents were advised to abort him as doctors feared he would not survive for more than an hour after his birth , if he survived the birth mr @entity8 and ms @entity9 refused to abort their baby and @entity28 is now a healthy three - month - old she was then told that both she and the baby would need special care after the birth - if he survived			1
the mother prepared herself for the prospect of not seeing her newborn baby after having a c - section under general anaesthetic			2
doctors say they are not aware of any other babies in the @entity7 who share @entity8 ' combination of dwarfism			1
dr @entity76 , a consultant clinical geneticist at @entity77 said : ' @entity28 has achondroplasia and pseudoachondroplasia and although the two have similar names they are two very difference and distinct conditions			2
' they are a combination i have personally seen before - but only in a child in the @entity88 in 1997			0
' it is a very rare condition and i am not aware of anymore children in our region with it , and i have sought advice from other colleagues in other parts of the country , and they too are not aware of any other children who have both			0
' dr @entity76 , who is @entity28 's consultant , added : ' it is not a common combination			2
' dr @entity103 , a consultant in clinical genetics at @entity106 ’s @entity105 and also in @entity107 , told @entity108 it is rare for a child to have two different forms of dwarfism			2
he said that both pseudoachondroplasia and achondroplasia are both dominant genetic conditions			0
this means that if a couple who each have a different form of dwarfism have a child , that child will have : a 25 per cent chance of inheriting neither condition , a 25 per cent chance of inheriting both conditions and a 50 per cent chance of inheriting one but not the other			0
he explained that children with two different form of dwarfism are likely to have ' poorer outcomes ' than those that just have one type			2
this is because they can develop symptoms associated with each of the two conditions			0
but she was amazed when she woke from the operation to find her fiancé sitting at her bedside with the newborn by his side			0
ms @entity9 , who has appeared in a number of films such as @entity149 and the @entity150 , said : ‘ i was having scans once a week because they were a little worried there could be complications			2
‘ it was n’t until 24 or 25 weeks that things started changing			0
they noticed that his measurements were n’t quite what they should be			0
‘ they thought that he had inherited two rare genes that could have been dangerous			0
‘ i was told to consider abortion and told that if he had these genes he would probably die within half an hour of birth			1
‘ i did n’t even think about abortion at any point - i do n’t believe in abortion			0
i could feel him moving around inside me - he was a little wriggler			0
in my head everything was fine			0
‘ when i went down to theatre to have him i was so worried - they had been very cautious with us and said that there was a high chance we would need special care after he was born and that i might not see him			0
‘ when i woke up @entity28 was stood next to me with little @entity28 in a cot			2
i could n’t believe it - i just cried			0
’ ms @entity9 , who is the only person with dwarfism in her family , has achondroplasia - meaning she has shortened limbs as well as a curvature of the spine - causing serious pain			1
mr @entity8 , who lived in @entity189 before meeting ms @entity9 , has a different form of dwarfism - pseudoachondroplasia , which means his bone growth is stunted and he has weak hips			1
experts fear that baby @entity28 may inherit back and hip problems due to having both strands of dwarfism , but it is not yet known if he will have either			1
his mother said that she hopes @entity28 will be able to live a normal life , much like herself , despite his condition			1
she added that while she was sure @entity28 was the only person in the @entity7 to become a ' double dwarf ' , the condition had been heard of elsewhere in the world			1
ms @entity9 ( centre ) is an actress who has appeared in @entity206 's @entity207 ( pictured ) as well as in one of the @entity149 films doctors do not really know what impact the ' double dwarfism ' will have on @entity28 but they believe he has every chance of leading a relatively normal life she said : ‘ @entity28 has inherited both forms of dwarfism and is therefore a double dwarf			1
‘ the doctors have never come across it before			0
they have heard about it but they really do n’t know much - they have no idea what the problems caused will be or anything			0
‘ at the moment they are watching him quite carefully because they do n’t really know what to expect			0
‘ the problem is that because of his dwarfism big @entity28 has very bad hips , which causes him to walk a little unusually			1
‘ my dwarfism means i have a curvature of the spine and am often in a lot of pain			0
ms @entity9 said : ' i did n't even think about abortion at any point - i do n't believe in abortion			2
i could feel him moving around inside me - he was a little wriggler			0
in my head everything was fine ' mr @entity8 and ms @entity9 ( left ) hope their baby will lead a relatively normal life , as they do ‘ we are hoping that little @entity28 will get my hips and his dad ’s spine so that he can avoid both these problems but i guess ultimately he might end up with both			1
‘ i am hoping that he will have a fairly normal life like i have had			1
‘ my family are all normal size so nothing was ever really adapted for me - i would just have to work around it			0
‘ i ’m not sure he is the only person in the world with the condition but he is certainly the only person in the @entity7			0
‘ doctors have heard a bit about it before so it might be that people in @entity88 or something have had it before			0
’ mr @entity8 has problems with his hips and ms @entity9 has a curved spine which causes her a lot of pain			1
doctors are worried that @entity28 might develop both of these problems ms @entity9 ( pictured during the countdown to the @entity274 ) used to be a swimmer who swam for @entity276 mr @entity8 and ms @entity9 met in december 2012 whilst performing in pantomime on the @entity206 documentary @entity207			1
the pair got engaged in march 2013 and @entity9 became pregnant in april 2013 , though they had not been trying for a baby			2
despite the new arrival delaying marriage plans , the couple hope to tie the knot later this year or early next year			0
though they are not quite sure what is in store with baby @entity28 they say they will remain patient in the hope he will lead a life as enjoyable as theirs			1
ms @entity9 said : ‘ i would n’t have been able to cope if little @entity28 had n’t made it			1
‘ we really are n’t sure what we can expect to happen with little @entity28 now , doctors have said he probably wo n’t start learning to walk until he is at least 18 months			1
ms @entity9 ( centre ) and mr @entity8 ( far left ) now plan to get married			1
they are pictured with their friends from @entity206 's @entity207 ‘ i guess we will just have to be patient and make sure we do n’t pick him up or discourage him in any way			0
’ doctors today confirmed they were not aware of any other babies in the @entity7 who shared @entity8 ' combination of conditions			1
dr @entity76 , a consultant clinical geneticist at @entity77 said : ' @entity28 has achondroplasia and pseudoachondroplasia and although the two have similar names they are two very difference and distinct conditions			2
' they are a combination i have personally seen before - but only in a child in the @entity319 in 1997			0
' it is a very rare condition and i am not aware of anymore children in our region with it , and i have sought advice from other colleagues in other parts of the country , and they too are not aware of any other children who have both			0
' dr @entity76 , who is @entity28 's consultant , added : ' it is not a common combination			2

@entity8 , three months old , has two types of dwarfism
his mother , @entity9 , 24 , has hailed him a ' double dwarf '
he got one type from @entity9 and the other from his father , @entity28
they were told he would probably not survive more than an hour after birth
they decided to continue the pregnancy anyway and he was born healthy
it is feared @entity28 could have back and hip problems later in life
doctors hope that , otherwise , he will live a relatively normal life
