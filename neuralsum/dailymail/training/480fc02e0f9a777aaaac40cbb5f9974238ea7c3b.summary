ten days ago @entity1 ’s grey hair was going even greyer			1
out came the @entity3 , mixed in with some jet black boot polish , and all of a sudden the @entity6 boss and his team are looking lively again ! he ’s proved his critics , including me , wrong			2
it could all be temporary , of course			0
@entity1 ( right ) speaks to @entity12 boss @entity11 before their @entity14 clash @entity15 scored a hat - trick to save @entity6 and take them through to the knockout stages in @entity18 the top four of the @entity20 shows @entity6 six points behind leaders @entity23 after 13 games honestly , ask yourself this : should @entity26 with the players they have , the recent years of success and the resources at the disposal be winning the three games they ’ve just won ? yes of course ! it ’s no shock that @entity6 beat @entity35 , @entity12 ’s 10 - man reserve team , and @entity37			1
by now , @entity6 should be standing tall alongside the very best in @entity18			2
@entity1 ’s great escape from @entity40 will be looked on as something special			2
but they should n’t have got themselves into this mess in the first place			0
the best defenders are n’t those who always end up making last - ditch tackles , they ’re the ones who do n’t get themselves into trouble at all			0
and at the very top level the same applies to managers			0
but what @entity1 has proved this week is that he can deliver under pressure			1
a @entity6 - supporting friend of mine spoke with me before the @entity35 fixture , and said if they lost two of the forthcoming three games then the manager should go			1
@entity1 knew that two defeats would almost certainly mean @entity6 were out of the only competitions @entity64 is interested in winning – the @entity14 and the @entity20			1
@entity1 deserves credit for delivering under pressure ... but three wins does not mean he 's done enough @entity68 , @entity15 and @entity69 celebrate after the latter put @entity6 1 - 0 up against @entity37 on sunday things could n’t have gone better : @entity72 drew in @entity73 , @entity12 played a weakened side and had a man sent off , @entity15 turned it on at just the right time , @entity6 won all three games , and even @entity23 dropped points			1
it could be the week that transforms @entity6 ’s season			2
in fact it should be			0
but they still have a tough task in the @entity14 , and they are still six points behind @entity23 at the top of the table			0
and that ’s the problem for @entity1			0
he ’s had a terrific week , but he can hardly wave it in the faces of us critics because @entity6 are still some way off where they should be this season			0
a tough week for @entity1 to come through and he deserves credit , but let ’s not get carried away – he ’s got a lot of work to do before he proves he is the right manager to take @entity6 to where the owners want them to be – dominating domestically and in @entity18 .			1

@entity6 should have won their last three games given their resources
they beat @entity35 , @entity12 reserves and @entity37
@entity1 did well under pressure to get three good results
he still has a long way to go to prove that he deserves the job at @entity6
