@entity0 , who is still searching for a coach to replace @entity13 , next meets @entity15 's @entity14			1
but the @entity30 is also erratic and , apparently troubled by a foot injury , he offered little in the first set			0
@entity0 raced into a 5 - 0 lead , looking extremely sharp after two weeks training on clay in @entity35 , and it was all @entity4 could do to avoid a love set			1
going the distance : @entity0 had to play three sets against @entity4 in order to earn his win job done : @entity0 is congratulated by @entity4 after his win @entity0 broke serve again at the start of the second and it looked like it would be a comfortable evening but @entity4 gained a foothold with a break back and on that the match turned			1
the @entity30 sensed an opportunity and began to show just what a talent he is , overpowering @entity0 with a run of six games in a row			2
the @entity7 knew he needed to dig in at the beginning of the decider and he did , saving three break points in the third game			0
fightback : @entity4 lost the first set but won the second to take the match into a third @entity4 did not drop a point on serve until the eighth game of the set , but @entity0 kept nudging ahead and he took his chance when his opponent served to stay in the match			1
it was @entity0 's first win over a spaniard on clay since beating @entity73 here in 2009 and arguably one of the best of his career on the red stuff			2

master in @entity89 : a general view of @entity92 court showing @entity0 beat @entity4 the pair had known each other since they were part of the same @entity97 team as juniors and @entity0 's mother @entity99 remained a close friend of @entity82			1
@entity0 took part in a tribute to the 30 - year - old in @entity89 on monday , and he told reporters in the @entity106 capital : ' it 's been a tough 10 days or so			2

he 's done it : @entity0 smiles after winning his men 's singles second round tennis match against @entity4 ' the more time that passes the more people will celebrate everything that @entity82 did because she was a great character , a great person , she got everything she could out of her potential			1
' everyone wants to be @entity22 champion and to be number one in the world but not everyone can have that			0
