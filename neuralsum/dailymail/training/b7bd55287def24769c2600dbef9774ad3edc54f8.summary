in a play on the old adage ' if walls could talk ' , a mural has been discovered that could be the world 's earliest warning sign			0
the 9,000 - year - old painting , found on a wall buried in the ancient @entity10 settlement of @entity11 , shows a village in front of an erupting volcano			1
researchers now believe , through the use of mineral dating and geochemical tests , that the volcano shown in the painting is the nearby @entity20 , found 70 miles from the settlement site			1
a mural , pictured , found on a wall in the @entity10 settlement of @entity11 depicts a village in front of a volcano			1
the painting is thought to be a warning about the danger of nearby stratovolcano @entity20 , located 70 miles northeast from where the mural was found @entity11 is @entity10 for ' fork ' and ' mound '			1
it was a @entity34 settlement from @entity35 to 7500 @entity35 , and last year it was added as a @entity36			0
in 1993 @entity37 from the @entity38 began extensive excavations on the site and discovered a series of domestic buildings , as well as artefacts and murals			0
it is believed up to 10,000 people would have lived in the region , in mud - brick houses arranged in a maze			0
@entity20 , also known as @entity20 , is a stratovolcano situated around 70 miles northeast of @entity11 in the @entity10 province of @entity52			1
its summit reaches 10,672 ft and it is the second highest mountain of central @entity54			0
it is thought the mural was painted to warn about the dangers of this stratovolcano , yet it may also have been the first landscape painting or even the first news report			1
the reddish - brown mural was painted using a natural earth pigment called ochre onto an adobe wall , made from sand , clay and water			2
it was unearthed during excavations that began in 1993 on the site of the ancient settlement in the @entity10 province of @entity73			1
volcanologist @entity74 from the @entity75 told @entity76 that his team took volcanic rock from @entity20 and used mineral dating to establish when the volcano may have historically erupted			2
these tests determined that there was an explosive eruption around 9,000 years ago			0
this coincided with carbon - 14 dating of the artefacts , and the wall on which the mural was painted , found at @entity11 - give or take 1,000 years			1
@entity11 and @entity20 @entity74 and his team carried out the test to establish whether or not the volcano had ever been active			1
previous theories suggested it was but there was little evidence proving these theories , or confirming when the eruptions took place			0
the painting is considered locally to be a warning sign about @entity20 and this latest research adds weight to these claims			2
@entity74 's research will be discussed at the @entity105 in @entity106 on thursday			0
@entity11 is @entity10 for ' fork ' and ' mound '			1
this is how @entity20 looks today			2
