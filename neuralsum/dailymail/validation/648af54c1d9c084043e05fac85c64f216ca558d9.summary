@entity0 has told @entity1 that he will not ‘ get on his knees ’ and beg the curly haired @entity5 prop to come out of retirement following a @entity8 threatening injury to @entity9			1
@entity9 , 22 , was on tuesday given a ’ 50 - 50 ’ chance of being ready for the ‘ pool of death ’ later this year because of a ruptured @entity13 , with his recovery already delayed by a week after specialists in @entity16 decided there is too much swelling to perform an immediate operation			1
it has left @entity20 painfully low on experience in the front - row – the four props in the matchday squad to face @entity25 have just 11 @entity26 starts between them – but @entity0 maintains the onus is on @entity1 , capped 100 times , to reverse his decision to hang up his international boots			1
@entity0 has told @entity1 that he will not ‘ get on his knees ’ and beg the prop to play @entity9 injured his achilles during @entity20 ' 23 - 16 win against @entity36 in the @entity37 ‘ i was surprised at the timing of his announcement , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was n’t out of our thoughts : we had played a little bit of phone tag , leaving messages and going backwards and forwards			0
if he has changed his mind and wants to get on the phone and say “ i made a rash decision , retired too early and want to be part of the @entity8 squad , ” that is a different conversation			2
@entity1 passes the ball during the @entity53 training session held at @entity54 in 2013 @entity20 captain @entity55 reacts with @entity1 during the @entity37 in 2013 ‘ at the moment i will not be going on bended knees ringing him saying “ please come back , we really desperately need you ”			2
for us , it ’s about dealing with the other players			0
if @entity1 was n’t retired from international rugby , then he may very well be in the squad now			1
’ making his test debut in 2003 , @entity1 became a household feature in the @entity5 pack alongside fellow front - row @entity67			1
while @entity1 will not feature on saturday because of his retirement , @entity67 will play no part because of a hamstring injury			1
asides from the changes up front , @entity0 has stuck with the same starting xv that beat @entity36 at the @entity76 , with his side needing to overturn the points advantage of @entity79 and @entity36 if they are going to snatch the championship			2
prop @entity9 had to leave the field on a stretcher at the @entity76 during @entity20 ' win over @entity36 @entity9 was pictured on crutches with his foot in a protective boot after the match if @entity20 do enjoy a landslide result at the @entity90 and pip their rivals to the title , they will find themselves in a position where there is no silverware to celebrate with			2
the two trophies are due to be sent elsewhere and - while there is understood to be disappointment behind the scenes - @entity0 accepts that it is a logical decision			1
‘ we can understand from the points difference that they are taking one to @entity105 and one to @entity106 , ’ he said			0
‘ if we do get enough points and win , we will celebrate in our own way			0
maybe we will get some medals to hang around our necks or maybe we will have to wait 24 hours ; we ’ll wait and see			0
‘ @entity111 limped off during @entity25 's defeat by @entity113 in @entity114 at the weekend if @entity111 plays he will be a major factor in @entity20 ' attempts to win the @entity37 after their early kick - off at the @entity90 , the tourists will move on to a black tie function at the @entity120 in central @entity114			0
they will have to wait on tenterhooks , but any hopes of a thumping victory could hinge on the fitness of @entity124 skipper @entity111 , who is struggling with a foot injury and is the heartbeat of the @entity25 team			0
‘ he ’s a catalyst for them , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ if they defend heavily in the front line with 14 or 15 men and we try to play too much rugby too early , they might get a chance of turnovers and penalties or intercepts			2
we have to negate two or three of their obvious strengths and put ourselves in a position to score some points			0
’ @entity0 knows his team need a large victory to overhaul @entity79 and @entity36 @entity20 beat @entity36 23 - 16 at the @entity76 to force themselves into title contention wales have identified the final 20 minutes as the opportunity to rack up their points difference and @entity0 has named a bench loaded with attacking intent			1
@entity152 has usurped @entity153 to provide scrum - half cover for @entity155 , who on tuesday signed a dual contract , while @entity157 and @entity158 will also be expected to make a late impact			0
‘ if the championship comes down to points difference , that says to me there is not a lot of difference between the three of the four teams at the top , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ we improve as a squad through campaigns and we have demonstrated that again in this competition			0
the exciting thing about the @entity8 is the time we will have together to do in - depth coaching and stuff we do not have the opportunity to do in the @entity37			1
the time we have together will make a massive difference			0
’ @entity0 's @entity20 side have a plus - 12 points difference , 25 behind @entity79 and 21 adrift of @entity36			1

@entity9 suffered a @entity8 threatening injury in @entity184
the 22 - year - old has been given a 50 - 50 chance of being ready to play
but @entity0 has *refused* to beg @entity1 to play in the game
@entity0 says onus is on @entity1 to come out of international retirement
