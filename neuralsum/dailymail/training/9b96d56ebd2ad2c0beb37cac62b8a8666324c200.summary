the haka is an emotive and spine - tingling performance on the rugby field when the @entity5 rugby team face - off against their opposition			1
but in this incredible video , those feelings are ramped up yet further as soldiers of 2/1 @entity10 perform their @entity11 , powerfully acknowledging the lives and feats of their fallen comrades as they come onto the @entity11 's parade ground			1
it is also an emotive farewell for they will leave via the waharoa ( the carved entrance way ) for the very last time			2
used as an indicator of emotion , the haka is a perfect way to remember and salute fallen soldiers as the family of a fallen soldier walk behind a hearse , the soldiers move forwards to greet the entourage before the @entity33 tradition begins			1
the performance is mind - blowing , each soldier seems like they know their role in the formation , whether it be barking the orders from the front , or circling the car from the side			2
