shaving , waxing , plucking - many of us spend hours getting rid of body hair			1
but this week , singer @entity3 decided to challenge convention and leave her underarms unshaved - perhaps she 's onto something , as there may be health benefits to having an ample covering of fuzz			1
here , with the help of experts , we explore why being hairy may be good for you			1
singer @entity3 this week shocked fans with this photo by challenging convention - and leaving her underarms unshaved how body hair helps your skin heal hair anywhere on the body is important for maintaining skin health , explains @entity23 , a professor of cell biology at the @entity25			1
' each hair follicle [ the tiny structure that sprouts hairs ] is not just producing a hair fibre , but also has masses of blood vessels , nerves and fat around it			1
' hair follicles are also rich in stem cells - cells that never lose the capacity to renew themselves - which help the skin heal			1
' if you compared a wound on the outside of a man 's arm , where the hair follicles are larger and more numerous , with a wound on the inside of the arm , the one on the outside would heal better , because of the increased stem cells and blood supply , among other factors , ' says professor @entity23			1
similarly , a bald scalp is less able to cope with nicks , cuts and bruising than a hairy one because of the lack of healthy follicles			0
as we age , follicles shrink and while people who lose hair will still have some stem cells , their healing capacity may be reduced			1
the good news is that removing hair through shaving or waxing wo n't reduce these benefits because the hair follicles are still intact			1
... and provides @entity70 body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment , keeping us warm and protecting us from environmental impact such as sunlight , explains @entity77 , consultant dermatologist from @entity79 's @entity78			1
while few of us have dense enough hair to serve this purpose now , someone who 's particularly hairy may have an extra degree of sun protection , he says			1
another historic function of body hair was to keep us warm , says professor @entity23 , who is also director of the @entity87			1
' we do know bald heads lose more heat , and that when we 're cold , our body hair stands on end to trap warm air closer to the surface of the skin			1
' body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment			1
now , experts have revealed the various ways in which being hairy may be good for us - despite our constant attempts to remove it do n't pluck your nasal hair unsightly as they may be , hairs in the nostrils do have a role - to prevent foreign material , such as dust , getting in to the nose and lungs , says @entity109 , an ear , nose and throat consultant at @entity113			1
if you want to defuzz your nostrils , trimming might be better to plucking , particularly if you have a cold , adds mr @entity109			0
' when you pluck , you 're pulling the root out , which leaves a hole in the skin - that 's a potential source of infection , so you may want to avoid plucking when there 's lots of infections around '			2
surprisingly , the tip of the nose technically has the most dense patch of hair on the body			2
we 're born with all our hair follicles - 5 million of them			2
as we grow into adults , the hair on our limbs becomes spaced out , but the tip of the nose stays a relatively similar size , explains professor @entity23			2
does a hairy chest imply intelligence ? those who are particularly hairy - such as the actor @entity137 ( pictured ) - may have extra sun protection an ample chest rug has long been seen as a sign of masculinity and good health in a man			1
and there may be something in it			0
as boys and girls go through puberty , some of the light , unpigmented hair on their bodies - called vellus hair - becomes thicker and darker , under the influence of hormones such as testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone , becoming what is known as terminal hair			2
as men tend to have higher levels of these hormones , they usually have more terminal hair , and in more areas than a woman , such as the face , abdomen and chest			2
so when a man has a good smattering of chest hair it could be a sign that he has healthy levels of testosterone , says @entity174 , a consultant endocrinologist at @entity175 , @entity176			1
however , not having much chest hair does not mean a man is unhealthy , she adds - it can be simply down to your genes			2
someone with less obvious body hair may have perfectly healthy levels of male hormones , but the receptors in the skin are less responsive to them			2
some research links the hairiness of a man 's chest to his intelligence			0
in the @entity196 , @entity194 , a @entity195 psychiatrist , claimed that hairy chests are more likely to be found among doctors than the general population - he found 45 per cent of male trainee doctors were ' very hairy ' compared with less than 10 per cent of men generally			0
but professor @entity23 is sceptical , saying unless factors such as race , ethnicity and socio - economic status were ruled out , such findings were meaningless			0
women who use hair removal creams around their bikini line may find they are more prone to thrush why it pays to stay @entity212 another function of hair is it provides a ' slippage zone ' , preventing chafing in areas where skin surfaces rub against one another			2
ironically , these are often areas where people may be most keen to be hair - free - such as the armpits and bikini area			2
' even the finest hair coverage on the body provides this glide buffer zone , ' says professor @entity23			2
' so , some people who shave under their arms find it 's uncomfortable to move their arms against the side of their body - like a carpet burn			0
' meanwhile , women who use hair removal creams around their bikini line may find they are more prone to thrush , a common yeast infection that causes itching , irritation and discharge , says @entity241 , a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at @entity243 , @entity79			2
' some people may have allergies to these products			0
an allergic reaction may then precipitate inflammation which triggers an episode of thrush			0
' repeated hair removal in this area , whatever the method , can sometimes cause a minor infection called folliculitis - disrupting the hair follicle may allow bacteria to get into the hair 's root			2
' because there is a high concentration of follicles in this area , and increased sweat ( on which bacteria feed ) , the chances of an infection are higher , ' says mr @entity241			0
hairy toes may mean good circulation losing the hair on the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease it 's rarely considered an attractive feature , but hair on your toes could be a sign that your circulation is in good working order			1
@entity280 , a consultant vascular surgeon at @entity281 , explains : ' losing the hair in the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease			0
' in this common condition , a build - up of deposits in the leg arteries restricts blood supply to the leg muscles			0
patients with it are more likely to have heart disease , too			0
hair follicles need a good blood supply for nutrients and oxygen			1
' if you get a blockage in the circulation in the legs , it means less oxygen will reach the bottom of the leg - far away from the heart - so the hair follicles there will suffer the most			1
' however , some people simply are n't very hairy on their toes anyway , and they do n't need to worry			0
' it 's only a sign of poor circulation if you had hair there in the first place , ' says mr @entity280			1
such hair loss usually happens to people for whom peripheral artery disease is quite advanced - an earlier symptom is pain in the calves when walking			0
leaving underarm hair intact may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partne @entity327 your ears hairs in the outer portion of the ear canal prevent dust and other particles from entering the ear			1
however , excess hair in the ears may collect wax , which can block the ear canal and hamper hearing - so if you are prone to build - ups of ear wax you may want to consider trimming these hairs			0
but this may affect your hearing , according to dr @entity345 , an anthropologist at @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348			0
he suggests there are two types of tiny sensory hairs which help transmit sound signals to the brain			0
those in the outer ear boost soft sounds and reduce the loud sounds , while those in the inner ear transmit the sound waves to the auditory nerve			0
writing in the journal @entity364 , dr @entity345 suggests very hairy ears could confer better hearing			0
however , @entity368 experts are deeply sceptical			0
@entity369 ? @entity370 another argument for leaving underarm hair intact is that it may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partner			1
as professor @entity23 says : ' in other mammals , body hair is very important for dispersing odours , such as pheromones - chemicals that can help to attract mates			1
' whether humans have them too is a controversial area , but shaving your underarm hair could mean that odours are not dispersed into the air so quickly			1
' @entity386 on the fake @entity387 good news for bushy - browed @entity389 - the thicker your eyebrows , the better protected your eyes are from sweat and other particles			0
eyelashes , too , are important for keeping dust out of eyes , as well as helping them stay moist			0
' they redirect air flow over the eye lid and keep it out of the eyeball , stopping it drying out , ' explains professor @entity23			0
however , you do n't want eyelashes that are too long			0
a recent study from the @entity406 in the @entity195 found that if they are any longer than a third of the width of your eye , they 'll actually increase the air flow around the eye and have a drying effect .			0

@entity3 challenged convention and left her underarms unshaved
this may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partner
hair on your toes could be a sign that your circulation is good
