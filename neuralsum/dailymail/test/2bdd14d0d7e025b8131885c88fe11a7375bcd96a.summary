breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among @entity5 women the @entity5 spends $ 4billion a year on unnecessary medical costs due to mammograms generating false alarms and on treatment for breast tumors unlikely to cause problems , a new report has revealed			1
the study , published in the @entity15 journal on monday , has estimated the figure for women aged 40 to 59			1
it is made up of $ 2.8bn resulting from false - positive mammograms and another $ 1.2bn attributed to breast cancer overdiagnosis - treatment of tumors that grow slowly or not at all and are unlikely to develop into life - threatening disease			1
breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among @entity5 women , claiming nearly 41,000 lives a year			1
annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care , because cancer is easier to treat if detected early			2
but recently there has been disagreement about regular screening for women in their 40s			0
study authors @entity37 , a research fellow at @entity39 , and @entity40 , a professor at @entity41 , say their findings indicate that the cost of breast cancer overtreatment appears to be much higher than previously estimated			1
their $ 4bn figure is the midpoint of a range that depends upon assumptions about the rates of false - positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnosis			1
apart from the financial cost of screening tests and treatment , false positives and overdiagnosis expose women to risks from additional medical procedures , not to mention psychological distress			0
it is not uncommon for mammograms to turn up some apparent abnormality that has to be resolved with more imaging tests or a biopsy			0
' we 're hoping that the financial cost of this problem will help cast into greater relief the human cost , ' said @entity40			0
' the two messages together are powerful			0
the fact that this is not only a problem , but a very costly problem we hope will accelerate the attempts to try to fix the screening practices			0
' but another expert defended those practices , and called the study one - sided			2
' there was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits , ' said @entity85 , who heads prevention , detection and patient - support efforts at the @entity89			1
' i strongly feel that every study that looks at the downsides of any screening test has to be balanced with the benefits			2
' the @entity89 recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40 , while a government advisory group - the @entity96 - recommends that regular screening begins at 50			2
the study found that women aged 40 and 49 were more likely to have a false - positive mammogram , compared to women in their 50s			1
early detection : annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care , because cancer is easier to treat if detected early the @entity89 recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40 , while a government advisory group says regular screening should begin at 50 @entity85 questioned the assumptions behind the new study , saying that the authors made a ' very selective choice of estimates ' for the rates of false positives and overdiagnosis			1
' there is no debate about the benefits of mammography , ' he said			0
@entity40 responded that the assumptions in his study are supported by other research , and that by definition there is no medical benefit to mammograms that produce false - positive results			0
the study was based on billing data from a major @entity5 insurer , including more than 700,000 women aged between 40 and 59 in all 50 states , from 2011 through 2013			1
the @entity5 spends much more on healthcare than any other country , but lags behind other economically advanced societies on life expectancy and certain other health indicators			0
that has prompted strong interest among insurers , employers and government officials in comparing the effectiveness of competing treatments , tests and medications			0
cancer treatment may end up being one of the most closely followed issues in the broader debate over healthcare costs and benefits			2
a different study also published in monday 's @entity15 found that cancer death rates were lower in countries that spent more on cancer care , and that countries that increased spending the most made more progress in reducing death rates .			0

study estimates yearly figure for women aged 40 - 59
breast cancer is the second biggest cancer *killer* among @entity5 women
a *critic* claims there was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits
