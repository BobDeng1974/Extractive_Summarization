i 'm sure there were many millions tuning in for all the live action from @entity4 's fake @entity3 over on the @entity5			2
but around the same time , over on @entity7 , the big question was whether @entity9 's injured captain @entity8 was going to die a death as an @entity7 pundit for his own team 's @entity13 tie against @entity15			1
@entity16 has been pretty kind to @entity18 skippers of recent years			2
but that has tended to be from the world of cricket where the likes of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 have all managed to convert themselves from awkward post-match rent - a - quote merchants into erudite masters of punditry			1
for the majority of his playing career , you 'd struggle to argue that @entity8 has remained anything but staunchly in that first category			1
@entity38 may have made an entire career out staring intently out of a pained squint			2
but with a similar expression when on camera , @entity8 - and , yes , of course this is a man who has very much let his excellent feet do the talking - has tended to look more like he 's having a torch shone in his eyes while somewhere he should n't be			1
@entity8 worked as a pundit on @entity7 for @entity9 's @entity13 clash with @entity15 the 34 - year - old former @entity51 captain was not playing because of a hamstring injury however , that recent interview before the @entity55 derby with @entity56 on @entity57 shed light on a different @entity8			1
perhaps with the shackles now falling off , and certainly with a good mate to talk to , there was more than a hint that perhaps the real @entity8 will soon stand up			1
mind you , live telly is a different beast , and a bigger ask			2
yet he started the coverage looking relaxed , and with a big smile on his face			1
this i feel , was thanks to having the quality pairing of @entity74 - that 's @entity76 and @entity77 - alongside him			2
these two old stagers know their onions , but still chatter away like they ’re tucked in the corner of the snug on a sunday lunchtime			0
@entity76 in particular managed to lighten the mood quickly by interrupting proceedings to ask the injured midfielder if he had any idea how the grades of hamstring injuries worked , because he had none ? to which @entity8 just chuckled and said : ' have n't got a clue , either '			1
if it helps @entity76 , i think it goes from wafer thin to honey roast			0
@entity8 and @entity77 , who was also working for @entity7 , in the studio during the game @entity8 watches the @entity13 match from an unfamiliar vantage point @entity9 striker @entity100 struck a late penalty as the @entity102 beat @entity15 1 - 0 in the @entity13 @entity8 then faced his first little test when responding to a short film on his team mate @entity105			1
as at ease with a camera in his face as he is a ball at his feet , he explained that goal - scoring ' is natural for me '			2
but he also pointed out : ' i 'd be surprised if i do n't see ( @entity8 ) back here ' in a management capacity			1
@entity105 's captain deftly avoided that potential two - footer by talking about how he was still very much a player , and that he was also aware that management ' is tough '			1
' have a look at us ! ' , responded @entity76			0
a few more laughs , and that was the pre-match dealt with tidily			0
after what @entity121 then described as a ' tough 45 minutes ' , it was back to the pundits for their half time verdict			0
and although @entity8 's words said that ' for a nil - nil , it was very entertaining ' , it seemed that he had n't bothered to tell his face			1
which had reverted back to the rather dour demeanour it is given to adopt when out if a suit , and in a kit			0
but that 's just a lack of experience			0
not knowing to turn yourself back on			0
something he managed to do when he quipped of the excellent young @entity140 's first half : ' i think the contract he signed this morning has done him the world of good '			0
@entity8 started the evening slowly but grew into his role as a pundit @entity100 took the ball off team - mates @entity148 and fellow striker @entity105 to take the penalty post-match provided @entity8 with a different challenge as the winning penalty came shrouded in controversy			1
this i assumed would be the moment he pulled on the @entity159 's white coat and become @entity160			0
not a bit of it ! ' i 'd have took the penalty			0
that 's what would have happened ' , was the injured captain 's unswerving response to @entity169 's question			2
and he did n't stop there			0
' @entity148 [ @entity148 ] should have taken the penalty			0
this certainly got his two senior colleagues shifting in their seats			0
@entity77 started to explain he could n't see any problem with it , but @entity8 was all over him			1
' what would you have said to @entity100 if he had missed ? ' , he asked sharply			2
@entity77 replied : ' but he did n't ’ and @entity76 jumped in			0
' not the point ' snapped the @entity184 , as those two then went at it			0
i have to admit , this was not the diplomatic package i was expecting the @entity9 player to deliver at his place of work , inside @entity192			1
and so that was @entity8 at work in the tv booth			1
we got a few smiles , then some frowns , but in the end , absolutely no nonsense			0
in other words , exactly what we expect of him when he 's on the field of play			0
@entity100 celebrates in front of the @entity9 fans after converting from the spot to give his side victory the soon - to - be @entity210 midfielder has a glance over his shoulder on thursday night			1

@entity9 beat @entity15 1 - 0 at @entity192 in their @entity13 clash
club captain @entity8 missed the game through injury
instead of watching from the stands , @entity8 worked as a pundit for @entity7
the 34 - year - old started slowly , but grew into the role
