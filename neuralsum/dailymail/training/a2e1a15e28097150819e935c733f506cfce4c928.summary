by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 26 august 2013 a cocktail glass - shaped satellite that could provide a third of the world 's required energy by 2025 is being developed by @entity6			1
the design was created by dr @entity8 who was commissioned by @entity6 to explore the possibility of using solar panels in space to send energy to @entity13			1
what dr @entity8 came up with was an incredible floating satellite named the @entity17 , or @entity18 via arbitrarily large @entity19			1
it looks like a cocktail glass floating in space , but the @entity23 might be might actually be the future of how we collect solar energy in a recent interview with @entity28 at @entity29 , dr @entity8 claimed that , depending on funding , @entity18 - alpha could be launched by as early as 2025			1
' a single solar power satellite would deliver power to on the order of a third of humanity — not all at the same time , but any of that market could , in principle , be addressed , ' he said			0
the technology would mean that energy would beamed down to @entity13 where power stations would pick it up and farm it out to customers			2
the system would be made up of thousands of thin , curved mirror - like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible			2
the inside of the @entity17 would also be lined with photovaltic panels which convert the sun ’s energy into microwaves			1
these microwaves would then be beamed down to @entity13 out of the bottom end of the ‘ cocktail glass ’			2
the system would be made up of thousands of thin , curved mirror - like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible dr @entity8 , who runs @entity61 - based firm @entity60 , claims that the system would be much cheaper than some alternatives like a single array that could go around @entity13			1
on the @entity6 website dr @entity8 writes the project is a ‘ a novel , bio-mimetic approach to the challenge of space solar power ’			1
‘ if successful , this project will make possible the construction of huge platforms from tens of thousands of small elements that can deliver remotely and affordably 10s to 1000s of megawatts using wireless power transmission to markets on @entity13 and missions in space , ' he said			2
solar energy available in space is billions of times greater than we use on @entity13 and beaming it down has long been seen as the answer to our dwindling energy supplies			1
last year researchers at @entity88 tested equipment in space that could collect energy and transfer it back to earth through microwaves or lasers			0
as part of the project , researchers at @entity96 aim to produce a ' swarm ' of satellites that could one day power whole cities the project waspart of a @entity104 ( @entity104 ) study led by dr @entity8			0
the role of the team at the @entity96 was to develop innovative solutions for the structural elements of the project			0
the researchers hope to eventually produce a ' swarm ' of satellites that could one day power whole cities			0
initially the tiny satellites would n't replace ordinary power grids - instead , they could swiftly resupply power to disaster areas or outlying districts that are difficult to reach			0
a ' receiver ' on @entity13 would turn the precisely targeted microwave or laser beams into usable electricity			0
dr @entity124 , of the @entity96 , said : ‘ space provides a fantastic source for collecting solar power and we have the advantage of being able to gather it regardless of the time of the day or indeed the weather conditions			0

@entity18 - @entity17 is being developed by former @entity6 *engineer* @entity8
system would have *pv* panels which convert solar energy into microwaves
these microwaves could then be beamed to @entity13 to provide 24/7 energy
