@entity0 thinks that @entity1 secretly believes @entity2 can win the @entity3			1
maybe that explains the 10 changes from @entity6			0
you ’d hope it was the reason for the decision , because fielding weakened teams in this competition is folly given the winners are handed a route into the @entity14 - even if the hosts stretched their @entity17 record to just three defeats in 18			0
@entity1 ( centre ) was animated throughout as @entity20 defeated @entity21 @entity22 was surely sporting one of the bushiest beards ever to have graced an @entity26 touchline			1
the @entity21 manager ’s smart club suit did n’t particularly mirror his unkempt facial hair ; the way in which the @entity31 ’s arms flailed and head shook certainly did			2
@entity20 had the right idea beforehand in light of @entity38 ’s midweek antics , making sure the travelling contingent ’s majority were housed inside a good 90 minutes before kick - off			2
the @entity43 supporters marched through north @entity44 in full voice but then appeared to be more bothered about turning away chanting at each other than watching the game			0
there were 2,800 @entity21 fans getting behind their team in the away end at @entity52 @entity21 boss @entity22 ( left ) was sporting an impressive beard as he patrolled the touchline @entity55 went into this with four goals in five for three different clubs against @entity2			1
the striker was clearly fired up in a bid to add to that - smacking the bar just after smashing an arm into the face of @entity64			0
nobody can accuse the @entity67 man of not putting himself about			0
@entity55 was involved in a heart - warming man hug at the break with @entity70 , who had waited for him before making his way down the tunnel			2
@entity55 now has five goals in six appearances against @entity20 the former @entity77 striker certainly made his presence felt during the @entity80 clash @entity1 is better off leaving his players to it			1
as we ticked towards half - time , the @entity2 boss retrieved a ball to have strayed out of play , unsuccessfully attempted to juggle it before losing control			1
he rightfully picked it up and volleyed back out of his hands			0
@entity93 was at the @entity52 - a place he calls ‘ the old nest ’			1
the former midfielder - who was last seen playing himself ( and frequently seeing red ) as manager of @entity98 - is still a favourite here			0
poor old fourth official @entity100 got it in both ears from @entity22 and @entity1 simultaneously thanks to the incompetence of referee @entity104			1
@entity2 were inexplicably allowed to continue when @entity105 was poleaxed on halfway , with @entity106 then very fortunate to get away with hacking down @entity107 just outside the box			2
the @entity110 officials did n’t have the best evening of their careers , it has to be said			0
former @entity113 midfielder @entity93 was in attendance at @entity52 fourth official @entity115 ( centre ) was getting it in both ears from @entity119 and @entity22 @entity120 celebrates putting @entity20 1 - 0 ahead against @entity21 on thursday night @entity121 ( above ) raises his hands aloft as he watches @entity120 's strike his the back of the net			1

@entity55 *scores* fifth goal in six appearances against @entity20
fourth official has a busy night as he looked to control @entity22 and @entity1
@entity120 gave @entity20 first half lead
2,800 @entity21 fans *filled* up the @entity52 away end
former @entity2 midfielder @entity93 was in attendance at @entity52
