@entity0 is being urged by @entity1 to give up hopes of securing a decent @entity4 majority and focus resources on ' limping ' into @entity6			1
senior @entity8 figures have told @entity9 the leadership must slash the number of target seats from 106 to as few as 70			1
it comes amid growing fears that mr @entity0 's personal unpopularity is holding the party back and will fail to make inroads in enough constituencies to give him an outright majority			1
in a 1,000 - word @entity37 post , he said next may 's vote will ' decide the future direction of our country '			0
he added : ' @entity8 will fight and win this election street by street , house by house , taking our case to the people on every issue			1
' that is how i am going to be spending the next six months			0
that is what my @entity52 and our mps will be doing			1
' that is what our councillors , party members and activists will be doing – because that is what they do week in and week out – and they know that is how we win			0
' we are in the fight for the future of our country and in the @entity8 will show we are equal to the challenges of the time in which we live			1
' today marks six months to go until the general election , when mr @entity0 hopes to return @entity8 to power			1
last night mr @entity0 dismissed talk of a leadership coup against him as ' nonsense '			2
today @entity72 and @entity73 were forced to issue statements dismissing reports they were planning for a ' post-miliband future '			1
@entity8 currently has 257 seats and needs to win another 24 from the @entity30 to become the biggest party and at least 70 to secure an outright majority and not have to enter a coalition			1
at present @entity8 has a list of 106 target seats given additional money , support and activists in a drive to woo swing voters and give @entity8 a sizeable commons majority of almost 40 seats			1
but there are now calls for the ambitions to be dramatically scaled back to just 70 seats , which would be enough for @entity8 to secure a majority of just two			1
a shadow minister told @entity9 : ' you look at the list of marginal seats , and i have been to a lot of them , and you just think we 're not going to win that one , we 're not going to win that one … ' we are not going to win 106 more seats			1
somebody needs to have a difficult conversation with the people in 30 or 40 of those seats and say ' look , we ca n't justify giving you extra money when you 're not going to win '			0
' the money would be better spent on 70 key seats in the hope we can limp over the line			2
' the admission comes after a meeting of @entity118 this week where the idea of abandoning dozens of target seats was also discussed			1
the gathering of 30 or so @entity118 based mps was chaired by the @entity124 veteran and former cabinet minister @entity125			0
she has been sidelined by party high command since the election defeat of 2010 , but has long argued that @entity8 must broaden its appeal			1
mr @entity0 's team had hoped that the rise of @entity133 would eat into @entity30 support allowing @entity8 seize seats across the country			1
but the party was stunned by the recent @entity138 and @entity139 by - election in its @entity142 heartland where @entity133 came within 600 votes of taking a supposedly safe @entity8 seat			1
@entity8 needs to take 24 seats directly off the @entity30 to make it the biggest party in the @entity4			1
however , there is a growing sense that it will struggle to retake key seats like @entity150 and @entity151 or @entity152			0
' we think we 're going to get @entity154 back from the @entity155 , but @entity156 is so dug in we 've got no chance , ' said one normally loyal @entity8 mp			1
' we need to be realistic and direct what money we 've got at the seats we stand some chance of winning			0
' labour mps are also dismayed at a collapse in support in @entity165			0
a devastating poll last week suggested @entity8 is facing near - wipeout north of the border			2
@entity169 found that 52 per cent of @entity165 would vote for the @entity170 if there , compared with just 23 per cent for @entity8			2
a devastating @entity173 poll for @entity174 last week revealed how support for the @entity170 has surged since 201 it means @entity8 would be left with a rump of just four mps , shattering mr @entity0 's hopes of becoming prime minister			1
a former @entity8 minister told @entity9 : ' i went to @entity165 during the referendum campaign and even in our strong areas like @entity186 the organisation is hopeless			2
' at the 2010 general election @entity8 won 42 per cent of the @entity165 vote , compared with the @entity170 's share of 19.9 per cent			2
polls show mr @entity0 he is now less popular than every leader for 30 years who has taken their party to defeat in a general election , with ' depressed ' @entity1 fearing he will cost them victory in 2015			1
even @entity199 's personal ratings were better six months before he too labour to defeat			0
several senior @entity8 figures now believe the party would be performing better with almost anyone else in charge			2
analysis of @entity173 polling dating back to 1977 by @entity9 shows how only @entity206 had worse personal satisfaction ratings than @entity0 six months before a general election face - off : @entity73 , left , has union backing , while @entity72 , right , is the bookies ' favourits mr @entity0 's fate appears to hinge on whether shadow ministers – some of whom are understood to have met privately to discuss his future – can agree on his fate and engineer a ' coronation ' rather than a divisive leadership contest with an election only months away			1
the @entity221 reported that ms @entity72 , the shadow home secretary , and mr @entity73 , the shadow education secretary , to have struck a ' non-aggression pact '			0
but a spokesman for ms @entity72 said there was ' no foundation whatsoever ' to the suggestion			0
' the spreading of lies like this only damages the @entity228 and should be seen as exactly what it is - complete and utter garbage , ' he said			0
' @entity72 , the shadow cabinet and the party are united behind @entity0 's leadership			2
' shadow health secretary mr @entity73 said : ' the stories in today 's newspapers are complete and pure fiction			0
there is not a shred of truth in them			0
' what i think it 's part of is a deliberate and desperate attempt to destabilise the @entity228 and to divide us			0
but i can say this : it wo n't work			0
we are a united team , we are united behind @entity251 ' he told @entity253 : ' my focus is on the @entity255 , exposing the damage that this government is doing and working hard to deliver the @entity8 government that this country needs and certainly that my constituency needs			2
' that is where my focus is			0
i 'm working hard to support @entity0 in every single way i can			2
' writing on the @entity266 website , shadow business secretary mr @entity264 said the rumblings were ' nonsense which some in the @entity271 bubble want to distract us with '			0
mr @entity264 added : ' the simple fact is that because of @entity0 's leadership we are now within touching distance of being what many thought impossible four years ago			2
' we have a leader who has kept us united and overseen the renewal which so eluded us at the end of our time in government			0
@entity0 is an honest , sincere man of deep beliefs			0
' @entity284 education secretary @entity283 said : ' @entity0 is the right person to lead @entity8 and the right person to lead @entity286			1
he has shown the ideas and the leadership to take @entity8 into government and to complete the historic task of @entity8 as a one - term opposition			0
' we 're focused on the issues that matter to voters - on the cost of living crisis facing my constituents in @entity297 , on the @entity255 , on reforming technical and vocational education to give every young person the opportunity to reach his or her potential			0
' we 're a united party and that will remain as we expose the failures of @entity305 's woeful record			0
