she 's a household name and has graced @entity2 tv screens throughout the early @entity3 and @entity4 , but it 's her appearance as a bubbly , upbeat housewife on the @entity9 advertisements that is perhaps @entity11 's most famous role			1
however , despite the glossy , upbeat image portrayed on our screens , @entity15 , now 62 , has revealed she attempted to commit suicide at age 43 , and that her teenage daughter @entity19 was the one who found her			1
' i woke up and there was an ambulance and @entity23 was waiting for me at home , ' @entity15 told @entity25 in a sobering interview			2
’ ' i had no idea when or how			0
i do n’t know if i was losing brain cells or if the pain was that hard to endure i just did n’t even want to think or feel anymore , ' she told @entity25			0
a few days later she began taking antidepressants , and it was during this time @entity15 reveals she attempted to take her own life , with daughter @entity19 finding her after a suicide attempt			1
distressing : @entity19 ( pictured with her mother in 2002 ) being the one to discover her was the hardest part of @entity15 's experience , the pair explained in the interview behind the screen : the actress , best known these days as the bubbly face of @entity61 , has revealed her marriage breakdowns contributed to her depression ' my first instinct was to call 000 , roll her on her side , it was kind of crazy , ' said @entity19			1
' i think for her knowing i found her like that , is probably the hardest thing			2
' cop shop crew : @entity11 with former husband and co worker @entity72 @entity15 , who suffered a marriage break down to fellow actor @entity72 , and then subsequently a second marriage breakdown to @entity76 , the cycle of rejection were devastating blows in her life			1
@entity72 , a fellow actor from @entity81 , was @entity15 's first love			1
she admits that she felt so overpowered with love for him , so much so it took precedence over the love of her baby			0
this left her feeling like a bad mother , and was the start of a series of triggers she says lead to ' episode depression			0
' episodic depression , according to @entity15 , meant she could feel low as a result of one specific episode , despite there being a lot of happy things still happening in her life			1
for @entity15 , these episodes included - feeling like a bad mother , suffering a marriage breakdown , her mother passing away and then her marriage to @entity76 taking an unexpected turn for the worse			2
' i was filming @entity114 and @entity115 and @entity116 came up and said , " i would n't read the sunday paper if i were you			0
" ' they said " your husband ’s just admitted he ’s found his true love			0
" and i could n't work anymore , i went into a very , very dark place , ' she says			0
around this same period she attempted suicide , @entity15 received an ' order of @entity2 ' award from the @entity127 and was given a ' @entity129 ' tribute , a somewhat cruel irony , that she could n't fathom celebrating during such a dark time in her life			1
her salvation came though by getting involved in charity work			0
from cop to cleaning queen : @entity81 actress @entity11 is also famous for @entity9 ad raising over nine million for paralympians and the @entity141 ( whom she still is a patron of now ) , @entity15 admits helping others has served more to her than she could ever give back to them			1
' for anyone who is really down or depressed , the first thing you should do before anything else , is do something for someone else			0
if you do you will feel appreciated and you ’ll find an element of self worthiness you ’ll never have otherwise felt , ' she says			0
anyone who is suffering from depression or mental health issues should contact @entity154 on 1300 22 4636 ( @entity2 ) , the @entity155 on 1800 273 8255 ( @entity156 ) or the @entity157 on 08457 90 90 90 ( @entity158 ) , or a local help group			2
