@entity229 was not extradited to the @entity12 to face hacking charges @entity0 's indictment for allegedly hacking into @entity12 government computers has raised parallels to the case of @entity229 , who fought a 10 - year battle to avoid being extradited to @entity12			1
mr @entity229 , from @entity236 , @entity237 , was first arrested in 2002 after @entity12 authorities told the police that he had hacked into military computer systems , deleting key files and leaving a message saying : ' your security is c * * *			1
' the @entity12 government insisted that the 47 - year - old was a grave threat to national security - but mr @entity229 , who has @entity251 's syndrome , said that he was searching for proof that the authorities had covered up the existence of aliens			2
in 2005 , mr @entity229 was placed on bail following the signing of a controversial new treaty which allows the @entity12 to request the extradition of suspects from @entity8 without having to provide solid evidence of their guilt			2
he would have faced up to 70 years in prison if convicted of hacking - and said he feared he could be sent to the terrorist prison camp in @entity265			2
medical experts said that he would be very likely to kill himself if confined to an @entity12 prison			2
mr @entity229 fought a decade - long legal battle , backed by supporters including the @entity270 , but was defeated in the @entity271 , the @entity272 and the @entity273			0
however , in october last year home secretary @entity274 blocked his extradition on the grounds that it would be ' incompatible with mr @entity229 's human rights ' due to the high suicide risk			0
two months later , he learned that he would not stand trial in @entity8 either			0
@entity281 , the @entity282 , ruled that the chances of a successful conviction were ' not high ' and that it was therefore not in the public interest to pursue mr @entity229 further			0
