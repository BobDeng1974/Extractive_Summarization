by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 02:06 est , 24 october 2013 a @entity2 sergeant was caught on camera ‘ executing ’ a severely injured @entity5 prisoner before telling his comrades : ‘ i ’ve just broken the @entity7 , ’ a court martial heard yesterday			1
as the insurgent lay stricken with horrendous wounds from a helicopter strike , the 37 - year - old commando pointed his 9mm pistol at the man ’s chest and pulled the trigger			1
footage of the alleged cold - blooded killing in an @entity20 cornfield was captured in graphic video inadvertently filmed by one of the @entity23 on a helmet - mounted camera			2
the seven members of the military jury watch a video of @entity28 allegedly shooting the insurgent the sergeant then taunted the dying man , who twitched and convulsed as he gasped his final breaths , by telling him : ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * * , ’ it is claimed			1
yesterday dramatic images and audio recordings of the ‘ field execution ’ were played to a court martial where three commandos – known only as @entity39 – stand accused of murder			1
the men , who have been granted anonymity to protect them from any reprisals , deny the charges			0
it is the first case of its kind for @entity49 troops involved in the @entity20 campaign			0
prosecutors told the seven - strong military jury that @entity28 killed the wounded insurgent after his unit seized him on september 15 , 2011			1
@entity56 ‘ encouraged and assisted ’ him , the hearing was told @entity58 said the @entity5 fighter was ‘ harmless and posed no danger ’			1
he added : ‘ this was not a killing in the heat or exercise of armed conflict			0
the prosecution case is that it amounted to a field execution – the execution of a man who was entitled to be treated with dignity and respect			1
’ the court martial , which took place under tight security at @entity76 military court centre in @entity77 , was told the shooting followed an attack on a @entity49 checkpoint in @entity81			1
a surveillance blimp showed two insurgents launching an assault against the remote outpost with assault rifles			0
an @entity88 gunship was sent from @entity89 , @entity49 ’s main base in @entity20 , and fired 139 rounds from its 30mm cannon			0
members of the @entity93 turn in their seats to scrutinise the video clip the aircrew believed the man targeted ‘ simply could not have survived ’ the fearsome barrage , so the three @entity23 were sent on a ‘ battle damage assessment ’ patrol			2
the trio – who all served with @entity102 – discovered the severely wounded man lying in a field , armed with an old @entity106 assault rifle , two magazines of ammunition and a hand grenade			2
six minutes of film footage recorded on @entity112 ’s helmet was played to the trial , showing the unit approaching the stricken man and calling him a ‘ f * * * * * * p * * * * ’ , ‘ c * * * ’ and ‘ b * * * * * * ’			2
as they reach the @entity20 , he is lying on the ground , covered in blood , wearing white robes and no shoes			0
@entity28 used his radio to report that the enemy was still alive			1
the non-commissioned officer , with 13 years ’ service in the military , then ordered his men to move the prisoner out of sight of cameras on the surveillance blimp			0
the injured man was dragged into a wooded area nearby			2
@entity28 asked : ‘ anybody want to give first aid to this idiot ? ’ another voice quickly replied : ‘ nope ’			1
@entity141 offered to shoot him in the head , sparking laughter			0
but @entity28 rejects the idea as ‘ that would be f * * * * * * obvious ’			1
as the men discuss killing their prisoner , @entity112 is seen reaching up to the helmet camera and telling his comrades : ‘ let ’s switch this f * * * * r off			0
’ but a short time later , he switched the camera back on			0
in extraordinary footage , one @entity2 is heard saying , ‘ f * * * ’s sake , i ca n’t believe we are doing this			2
’ seconds later , @entity28 is filmed kneeling next to the man , putting his pistol to his chest and firing			1
the victim is seen convulsing and struggling after the shot			2
@entity28 then says : ‘ there you are			1
shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * *			0
it ’s nothing you would n’t do to us			0
’ he then turns to his comrades and says : ‘ obviously this does n’t go anywhere , fellas			0
i ’ve just broken the @entity7			0
’ @entity112 replies : ‘ @entity173			0
if it ever comes to light , it was just a warning shot			2
’ members of the defence legal team at @entity93 sit next to a blue screen erected in the courtroom to hide the identities of three @entity2 accused of the murder the patrol can be heard reporting back that the fighter had died of wounds inflicted by the gunship			1
part of the footage came to light in september 2012 when police searched a laptop following the arrest of another @entity2 on an unrelated matter			0
the images of the alleged murder were discovered a few weeks later following expert analysis			0
mr @entity197 said : ‘ it was obvious that they were intent upon killing their detainee , who at the time of the killing was harmless and who posed no danger to the defendants			0
‘ at its most basic the prosecution case is this : @entity28 – using a pistol – deliberately shot and killed an injured man			1
although @entity28 fired the gun at close range into the injured man ’s chest and caused his death , the prosecution case is that @entity56 and @entity141 were also party to his killing			1
the video footage clearly speaks for itself and shows the execution of a severely injured man			2
’ prosecutor @entity58 told the board at the @entity222 in @entity76 , @entity77 , that @entity112 filmed the incident on a camera mounted on his helmet the court heard the dead man had never been identified and no body had been found			1
during his police interview , @entity28 told detectives he fired a bullet into the insurgent through ‘ stress and anger ’ at seeing comrades killed on the battlefield			1
but he insisted the man was already dead			2
@entity141 wrote an account of the incident in his diary , the court heard			2
in it , he said he saw @entity28 carrying out the killing			1
he wrote that his only regret was he felt ‘ mugged off ’ he had not been able to ‘ pop off the @entity5 s * * * bag ’ himself ’			0
confronted with the video in october 2012 , the men changed their stories			0
@entity28 admitted firing his pistol but said he ‘ genuinely believed ’ the man was dead			1
@entity112 said he was giving the injured man first aid when @entity28 shot him			1
he said : ‘ i was stunned and there was a long pause before i said anything			0
if i was saying “ rog ” or “ roger ” to @entity28 after , i was just acknowledging i heard what he said – i was not agreeing with it			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
