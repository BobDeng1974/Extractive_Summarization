residents of @entity2 are outraged by a request from the @entity4 asking them to use the @entity5 as their official national anthem , it has been claimed since queen @entity8 handed over control of the small island - off the coast of @entity12 - to @entity14 islanders in 1856 , the 2,000 - strong population have been singing @entity8 to showcase their allegiance to the @entity18 monarchy			1
but residents have refused to comply with the @entity4 's request that was made last month by its newly appointed administrator @entity21 , @entity18 paper @entity23 reported			1
residents of @entity2 are outraged the @entity4 have asked them to stop using @entity8 as their official national anthem in the ultimate act of revolt , attendees of the island 's annual @entity24 and @entity25 on monday proudly belted out a rendition of @entity8 - with some brandishing the @entity32 flag			1
mr @entity21 wrote to @entity2 chief minister @entity33 last month saying the act of singing @entity8 was ' surely wrong ' as it had been ' 40 years since @entity8 was first replaced as the national anthem of the @entity12 '			1
but mr @entity33 fired back at the administrator and wrote they were a nation of ' staunch monarchists ' , and had a long and binding history with the @entity18 royals			2
in his letter of reply , mr @entity33 protested against the change and flatly refused to adopt the move			0
' @entity2 islanders in general regard their island as the homeland of descendants of the settlers from @entity14 who , in 1856 , were moved as a community to @entity2 , a community that came as a fully self - governing ethnic community with its own laws , language culture and traditions , ' he wrote			2
@entity2 chief minister @entity33 ( left ) and administrator of @entity2 @entity21 ( right ) have locked horns over the national anthem issue mr @entity33 went on to say that it was a controversial matter and @entity8 had been the chosen anthem for many years , which was sung on days that paid tribute to the fallen soldiers of @entity67 and @entity68 @entity69 has contacted the @entity70 in relation to this matter			1
mr @entity21 - a former @entity72 mp - was appointed in july as the 37th administrator of @entity2			1
but it appears it has not been smooth sailing for the nation island - who usually enjoys its autonomy from @entity12 - since mr @entity21 took the post			1
in a @entity81 press release date october 9 , mr @entity33 accuses the @entity82 of taking away the nation 's rights to self govern , which it has done for four years			2
' i believe the @entity82 intends to impose on @entity2 a slightly modified @entity88 model , which has proven to be dysfunctional , inoperable and does not allow for community representation and input above that of @entity93 status as clearly identified by the recent administrator of @entity88 , ' he said			0
@entity2 is located more than 1,400km off the coast of @entity96 @entity2 when the @entity14 people arrived after it was abandoned in 1853 @entity98 at @entity2 in 1885 , about 20 years before the federation of @entity12 in 1901 after the @entity18 invasion of @entity12 in 1788 , @entity2 - which was originally inhabited by @entity100 - became a convict settlement			0
it lay abandoned from 1814 to 1825 until it was decided by the then - governor of @entity96 that the criminals who committed the most severe offences would be sent there due to its remote location			0
again the island was abandoned in 1853 and then re-inhabited when @entity108 and mutineers of @entity110 were sent to it when the @entity14 were no longer suitable for the size of the population			0
soon farming and whaling became sources of income for those living on the island			0
@entity2 was given the right to govern as an external territory after the federation of @entity12 in 1901			0
it was also used as an airbase and a refuelling station for planes during @entity68			0

@entity12 has been using @entity5 as its national anthem for 40 years now
@entity2 have been using @entity8 as their official anthem since 1856
administrator @entity21 wrote to @entity2 's chief minister @entity33 last month
in the letter , mr @entity21 said it was ' surely wrong ' for the island to still be singing @entity8
