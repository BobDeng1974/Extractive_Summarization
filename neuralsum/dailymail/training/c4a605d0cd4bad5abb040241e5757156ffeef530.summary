by @entity0 published : 09:16 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:33 est , 14 february 2014 a young boy has credited his pet @entity4 with protecting him for a crippling condition that affects his nervous system			1
@entity8 has a rare disorder which means his heart races every time he stands up or becomes excited – this alters the blood supply to his brain , causing him to pass out			1
but , three - year - old fudge , a golden @entity4 , instinctively knows when @entity8 is about to fall ill and has kept him out of harm ’s way on countless occasions			1
@entity8 , 11 , has a rare condition which means his heart beats too fast when he moves meaning the blood supply to his brain is compromised and he is in danger of fainting			1
fudge sits by him when his heart is beating too fast to warn him not to stand up @entity8 , who turns 11 next week , has postural tachycardia syndrome ( @entity23 ) which causes dizziness , fainting , tiredness , palpitations , shortness of breath and headaches			1
he suffers up to 200 blinding ‘ ice pick ’ head pains a day as well as nausea and blurred vision			1
@entity8 , from @entity35 , in @entity36 , is so vulnerable , he has to be taught at home and to remain constantly in temperatures of 18 - @entity39 because a sudden change of temperature could cause him to fall ill. his heart can race dangerously if he eats any number of common foods including meat , dairy , fish and bread			1
fresh strawberries are one of the few things he can enjoy and his mother , @entity48 - widowed while pregnant when her husband was killed in a car crash - can travel up to 50 miles a day to find the four punnets a day he eats			1
‘ @entity8 was seven days old when his heart first went funny , he went stiff then limp in my arms and we ended up in hospital , ’ said mrs @entity56			1
‘ now he has to wait two hours before getting up each morning and we have to pace his whole day			0
if we do n’t , @entity8 can be knocked off his feet for over three weeks			2
‘ i think sometimes life throws things at us to make us stronger			0
’ if @entity8 blacks out , @entity21 finds his mother , @entity48 , to warn her			1
fudge is not trained to help @entity8 - he is just a pet who happens to have an instinctive ability to help the child but @entity8 ’s life changed for the better three years ago when @entity21 came along			1
he chose the runt of the litter because she had the ‘ waggiest tail ’			0
‘ she kept diving for him , ’ said mrs @entity56			2
‘ at four - days - old she started acting a bit strangely , sitting across his legs and not wanting to get off			0
‘ she would n’t let @entity8 get up so we moved her and shortly afterwards @entity8 collapsed			2
‘ we realised later this had developed into a pattern , @entity21 knew when @entity8 was going to have an attack			1
‘ even if he was upstairs being poorly in bed and i did n’t know , @entity21 would be at the bottom of the stairs crying			2
@entity23 is an abnormal response by the autonomic nervous system to becoming upright - the autonomic nervous system is in charge of all of the automatic bodily functions , such as sweating and digestion			0
the condition causes the heart rate to increase and alters the blood supply to the brain			1
there are many causes - pregnancy , viral illnesses , surgery , rapid growth spurts and bed rest - but , in some cases , no cause can be found			0
some patients are severely disabled by the condition while others have mild symptoms			0
symptoms include : symptoms can be triggered by excess heat , eating , standing up , dehydration , alcohol and exercise			0
source : @entity115 ‘ a couple of times she came up to me to let me know i ’m not moving fast enough			0
‘ it ’s also happened when @entity8 ’s been in the downstairs bathroom and he ’s become unwell			2
@entity21 will go running up to the door crying			2
‘ @entity8 used to end up in hospital a lot with concussion because he ’d fall and hit his head , but now fudge either cries or puts her paw on his arm warning him to sit down			1
‘ she just guards him the whole time and you know he ’s not well			0
when she ’s happy and running around we know @entity8 is in a good place too			2
‘ she does n’t miss an occasion			0
when @entity8 had a loop recorder implanted to monitor his heart , it showed afterwards that every time he ’d been extremely tachycardic [ his heart has been beating much too fast ] i ’d entered ‘ f ’ into the manual log i kept and that meant “ fudge ” , she had known he was n’t well			1
‘ sometimes i worry about her because it ’s like she ’s always working all the time although of course she ’s never been trained to do this , it ’s purely instinct			0
‘ even if @entity8 goes out cold fudge will let us know if it ’s serious or he ’ll come round by the way she ’s laying by his feet , she just wo n’t leave if he ’s bad			1
‘ when @entity8 ’s going to collapse she tends to pin him down but if he ’s about to have a head pain she ’ll paw him more or go and sit beside him and give a little nudge , it ’s really strange			2
‘ she helps him in so many ways			0
‘ the one disadvantage for @entity8 is that he can never lie about feeling unwell to get out of doing things because @entity21 gives the game away			1
’ @entity170 , a partner at the @entity171 where @entity21 is looked after , said : ‘ it ’s not uncommon for dogs to be trained to predict when people might be at risk of an epileptic fit , but @entity21 is the first dog i know of who has taken it on themselves to become a child ’s protector like this			2
’ one of the reasons the @entity185 decided to talk about their plight was to help raise the profile of @entity188 and @entity189 ( @entity190 ) – the charity which has helped them			0
mrs @entity56 said : ' it was only through the group that @entity8 was given a diagnosis and referred to @entity196			1
ever since it has been on hand to provide advice and practical support			0
' they are a fantastic charity , a lot of people get misdiagnosed with epilepsy when in fact it ’s a type of syncope			0
' quite rightly the big cancer charities are well known but not @entity190 , nor @entity208 – yet more people die of heart conditions than cancer			0
' no one really knows how many people live with it and to raise awareness would be fantastic , it might help find a cure			0
' @entity8 admitted that @entity21 was his best friend and a ‘ good dog ’			1
he had one message : ' make sure you love life			0

@entity8 , 11 , has postural tachycardia syndrome - his heart beats too fast when he moves causing the blood supply to his brain to be compromised
he suffers crippling head pains and *frequently* blacks out
fudge can tell if his heart **'s** beating too fast and he **'s** in danger of fainting
when this happens , @entity21 sits by him to warn him not to stand up
if he does pass out , @entity21 goes to find his mother , @entity56
fudge is ' just a pet ' - he has not been trained to look after @entity8
