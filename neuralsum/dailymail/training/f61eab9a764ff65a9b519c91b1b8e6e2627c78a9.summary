by @entity0 for @entity1 normally , getting picked up by the police is no laughing matter			2
but when one group of unruly fugitives were tracked down , the arresting officer found himself helpless against their charms			0
@entity9 @entity8 was driving home when he stumbled upon a litter of nine runaway puppies in the village of @entity14 in @entity15			1
but his plans were soon thrown out , as for every dog that he could get in the car , another one jumped from the vehicle			1
eventually , @entity20 resorted to depositing the puppies through the car 's windows to keep them all rounded up			1
his trouble did n't end there however , with the animals clambering across the dashboard and licking his ear as he drove them to a nearby police station			1
' it was the best day i 've ever had in my 24 - year career , ' said mr @entity8			1
' in this day in age there is a lot of hard work in policing , but this day , well , i was laughing my head off			0
' it was absolute chaos			0
' @entity20 said it was the best day in his 24 - year career as a policeman mr @entity8 , who has a @entity58 , was passing through the village after finishing a job in @entity61 when he saw the dogs running amok on the side of the road			1
the puppies , a variety of @entity68 sheepdogs and @entity69 from two different litters , were being chased by another motorist who had stopped to try and catch them			2
' it was quite a fast country road and i came round the bend on to the straight and i saw the car - then the puppies - and thought " what the hell is that ? " ' there was a mass of puppies and this poor woman who had spotted them first , trying to herd them			1
' they were wandering all over the road			2
' after bundling the dogs ' mother , an @entity92 , into the woman 's car , @entity20 tried to get the others into his vehicle			2
' the puppies were a bit more difficult to round up			0
' as soon as i opened the door to put one in another came out			2
' i was having to wind down the window and pop them in one at a time			0
' next thing i knew all the puppies were everywhere - they were on the dash board , on the back window , everywhere			2
' i was laughing my head off			0
they were stepping on the camera buttons and light buttons			0
it was absolute chaos , but it was so fun			0
' i rounded the ones that were n’t sleeping to the back seat and used my letter briefcase to wedge between the seats so that could n’t come forward			0
' but driving back i ’ve got one licking my ear , and one trying to climb out of the window			0
' the puppies were taken to @entity122 where their panicked owner collected them 20 minutes later			1
they had escaped through an open door at the house			1
' they were so cute			0
if i ’d had room at home , i ’d have taken them myself , ' added mr @entity8 .			1
