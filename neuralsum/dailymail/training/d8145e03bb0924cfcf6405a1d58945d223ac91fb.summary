the @entity0 is building a comprehensive facial recognition database through the intercepting of millions of photographs posted online everyday , according to a report from the @entity6 published saturday			1
according to the report , which cites top - secret documents leaked by former @entity0 contractor @entity9 , the @entity0 intercepts ' millions of images per day ' , which translates into approximately 55,000 ' facial recognition quality images			1
' according to a 2011 document cited in the report , this is regarded by the agency as ' tremendous untapped potential '			0
the report also says that the implementation of a facial recognition program has accelerated under the @entity23 administration , after two thwarted terrorist attacks , the first attempted in 2009 by @entity25 , a @entity26 , when he attempted to trigger a bomb hidden in his underwear while flying to @entity29 on @entity30 in 2009			1
the second was in may 2010 , when @entity32 , a @entity33 , attempted a car bombing in @entity35			0
documents obtained from the leak by former @entity0 contractor @entity9 show that the @entity0 is attempting to develop a facial recognition database , culling approximately 55,000 quality facial images from millions of intercepted photos everyday @entity25 ( pictured left ) and @entity32 ( pictured right ) , who both attempted terror attacks on @entity45 soil			1
these attacks reportedly prompted the @entity23 administration to allow the development of the @entity0 's facial recognition programs to accelerate according to the documents cited in the report , the @entity0 has broadened the scope of their surveillance techniques , by focusing on collecting identifiers such as facial photos and fingerprints in addition to traditional oral and written communication			1
' it ’s not just the traditional communications we ’re after ' says one 2010 document , ' it ’s taking a full - arsenal approach that digitally exploits the clues a target leaves behind in their regular activities on the net to compile biographic and biometric information that can help “ implement precision targeting			0
" ' the @entity0 has so far had mixed results with the accuracy of their facial recognition technology			1
an @entity72 from 2011 reportedly demonstrated the facial recognition of an unidentified man , who appeared in different photographs in different as at times bearded , while other times clean - shaven			2
the slideshow presented several points of information about the man , such as his passports , visa , status on the @entity85 's no - fly list , and suspected relationship with terrorist groups			0
@entity88 , in @entity89 , @entity90			0
according to reports , the @entity0 is attempting to develop more sophisticated facial recognition programs to better identify individuals through photographs however , the facial recognition algorithms used by the @entity0 have also been known to return with invalid results			1
in another 2011 document , the @entity0 's system processed a query using a photograph of @entity101			0
results were returned with four other bearded men , who 's faces only looked slightly like @entity101			0
this revelation of the @entity0 's farming of images online to collect facial pictures is similar to the discovery earlier this year that the @entity111 @entity110 intercepted streamed webcam chats from users of @entity114			1
the discovery , publicized by the @entity116 and also based on leaked documents from @entity9 , revealed that 1.8 million users had their privacy compromised			0
according to that report , up to 11 per cent of the pictures taken contained ' undesirable nudity			0
' @entity45 law currently does not provide specific protections for facial images			2
however , the @entity0 is still required to get court approval for communications collected of @entity45 citizens			1
these include photographs in addition to emails and telephone conversations			0
@entity0 whistleblower @entity9 , who provided the documents used by the @entity6 for their latest report , as well as documents used by other news outlets in reporting alleged privacy infringements by the @entity0 according to an @entity0 spokeswoman who spoke with the @entity6 , the @entity0 does not have access to state driver 's license pictures , nor passport photos			2
the spokeswoman declined to say whether or not the @entity0 was collecting facial imagery of @entity45 through social media			1
in the documents cited by the @entity6 , one of the tools used by the @entity0 to collect facial images is a program called @entity149 , which strips out images from emails and other communications , and displays those that might contain passport images			2
additionally , the @entity0 uses commercially available facial recognition technology , including @entity156 , a small company purchased by @entity157 in mid- 2011 .			2

@entity0 collecting 55,000 ' facial recognition quality images ' per day out of millions being intercepted
facial recognition program accelerated under @entity23 administration after foiled terror plots
@entity0 : no access to state id pictures or passports of @entity45 citizens
