by @entity0 and @entity1 global warming is rapidly turning @entity3 the beautiful into @entity3 the stormy , sneezy and dangerous , according to a new federal scientific report			1
and those shining seas ? rising and costly , the report says			2
climate change 's assorted harms ' are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond , ' concludes the 2014 @entity10 released on tuesday			1
the report emphasizes how warming and its all - too - wild weather are changing daily lives , even using the phrase ' climate disruption ' as another way of saying global warming			1
still , it 's not too late to prevent the worst of climate change , says the 840 - page report , which the @entity23 is highlighting as it tries to jump - start often stalled efforts to curb heat - trapping gases			1
since january 2010 , 43 of the lower 48 states have set at least one monthly record for heat			2
@entity33 had its warmest january on record this year			0
this march 13 photo shows cracks in the dry bed of the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity33 black line : observed global average changes			0
@entity42 area : model simulations using only changes in natural factors ( solar and volcanic )			2
blue area : model simulations with the addition of human - induced emissions			1
climate changes since 1950 can not be explained by natural factors or variability , and can only be explained by human factors , the report says			1
however , if the nation and the world do n't change the way they use energy , ' we 're still on the pathway to more damage and danger of the type that are described in great detail in the rest of this report , ' said study co-author @entity68 , co-director of the @entity69 on the @entity70 at the @entity71			1
@entity68 , other scientists and @entity23 officials said this is the most detailed and @entity75 - focused scientific report on global warming			1
' climate change , once considered an issue for a distant future , has moved firmly into the present , ' the report says			1
' corn producers in @entity83 , oyster growers in @entity86 and maple syrup producers in @entity87 are all observing climate - related changes that are outside of recent experience			1
' the report looks at regional and state - level effects of global warming , compared with recent reports from the @entity95 that lumped all of @entity3 together			2
the map on the left shows a projected change in average annual temperature over the period 2071 - 2099 ( compared to the period 1970 - 1999 ) under a scenario that assumes rapid reductions in emissions and concentrations of heat - trapping gases ( @entity106 2.6 )			1
the map on the right assumes continued increases in emissions ( @entity106 8.5 )			0
the colors on the map show temperature changes throughout the past 22 years ( 1991 - 2012 ) compared to the 1901 - 1960 average , and compared to the 1951 - 1980 average for @entity115 and @entity116			0
the bars on the graphs show the average temperature changes by decade for 1901 - 2012 ( relative to the 1901 - 1960 average ) for each region			0
the far right bar in each graph ( 2000s decade ) includes 2011 and 2012			0
the period from 2001 to 2012 was warmer than any previous decade in every region			0
the map on the left shows the projected change in average temperature under a scenario that assumes substantial reductions in heat trapping gases ( @entity132 )			1
the map on the right assumes continued increases in global emissions ( @entity136 ) a draft of the report was released in january 2013 , but this version has been reviewed by more scientists , the @entity141 and 13 government agencies and more than 4,000 public comments			1
it is written in a bit more simple language so people could realize ' that there 's a new source of risk in their lives , ' said study lead author @entity152 of @entity153 in @entity154			2
the advisory committee responsible for the report - which includes representatives from 13 @entity75 departments and agencies , academics , businesses and non-profits - released similar reports assessing the global climate in 2000 and 2009			1
even though the nation 's average temperature has risen by as much as 1.9 degrees since record keeping began in 1895 , it 's in the big , wild weather where the average person feels climate change the most , said co-author @entity172 , a @entity174 climate scientist			1
extreme weather like droughts , storms and heat waves hit us in the pocketbooks and can be seen by our own eyes , she said			1
and it 's happening a lot more often lately			0
the map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events ( defined as the heaviest 1 % of all daily events ) from 1958 to 2012 for each region of the continental @entity75			2
these trends are larger than natural variations for the @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , and @entity115			0
the trends are not larger than natural variations for the @entity200 , @entity116 , and the @entity201			0
the report says the intensity , frequency and duration of the strongest @entity207 hurricanes have increased since the early 1980s , but it is still uncertain how much of that is from man - made warming			2
winter storms have increased in frequency and intensity and shifted northward since the 1950s , it says			0
also , heavy downpours are increasing — by 71 percent in the @entity193			0
experts expect the number of times it rains to go down , but the intensity of downpours to go up			0
especially at risk in this region are the approximately 1.6 million people who live within the @entity227 ’s ( @entity227 ) 100 - year coastal flood zone , the majority of whom live in @entity229 and @entity230			0
heat waves , such as those in @entity233 in 2011 and the @entity194 in 2012 , are projected to intensify nationwide			1
droughts in the @entity235 and @entity200 are expected to get stronger			0
the combination of the two are contributing the dryness that precedes raging wildfires			0
the report concludes that heat waves are ' largely a natural phenomenon , ' but the increase in severity is ' likely due to human activity , with a detectable human influence in recent heat waves in the southern @entity197 , as well as in @entity248 , and @entity249			1
' human contributions to climate change ' approximately doubled the probability ' @entity233 would experience record - breaking heat			1
in january 2013 , none of @entity33 was in either extreme or exceptional drought ; now nearly 77 percent of the state is.this year @entity33 had its warmest january on record			0
since january 2010 , 43 of the lower 48 states have set at least one monthly record for heat , nineteen different state records were broke in the last year alone , according to an @entity0 analysis of federal weather records			0
@entity263 were for heat : @entity264 , @entity154 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity269 states set monthly records for being too wet : @entity83 ( twice , setting records for april and may last year ) , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity230 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity86			0
two states set records for lack of rain : @entity281 and @entity282			0
two set records for coldest individual months : @entity284 and @entity285			0
' we 're being hit hard , ' @entity172 said , comparing @entity3 to a boxer			0
' we 're holding steady , and we 're getting hit in the jaw			0
we 're starting to recover from one punch , and another punch comes			0
' the report also says ' climate change threatens human health and well - being in many ways			1
' those include smoke - filled air from more wildfires , smoggy air from pollution , more diseases from tainted food , water , mosquitoes and ticks			1
and then there 's more pollen because of warming weather and the effects of carbon dioxide on plants			0
ragweed pollen season has lengthened by 24 days in the @entity314 - @entity285 region between 1995 and 2011 , the report says			2
in other parts of the @entity194 , the pollen season has gotten longer by anywhere from 11 days to 20 days			0
sea level has risen 8 inches since 1880 and is projected to rise between 1 foot and 4 feet by 2100			2
authors of the report worry that the @entity321 , which borders @entity115 , @entity322 and @entity249 , could permanently become nearly ice free during the summer			1
even if humans completely ended harmful emissions , temperatures are predicted to rise by 0.5 ° f throughout the next several decades , not withstanding unpredictable natural disasters that could affect the global climate			1
at the current rate of human activity , temperatures will rise 2 - 4 ° f throughout the same period of time			1
and all this will come with a hefty cost , the report says			0
flooding alone may cost $ 325 billion by the year 2100 in one of the worst - case scenarios , with $ 130 billion of that in @entity274 , the report says			2
already the droughts and heat waves of 2011 and 2012 added about $ 10 billion to farm costs , the report says			1
warning : the report claims that extreme weather events like @entity345 have and will become more common billion - dollar weather disasters have hit everywhere across the nation , but have hit @entity233 , @entity349 and the @entity196 most often , the report says			2
of the more expensive weather events was the october 29 , 2012 @entity345			0
' the resultant direct costs to the community and indirect costs to the economy will undoubtedly rise into the tens of billions of dollars , ' the report says of the storm			2
the @entity23 plans to use the long report as scientific justification to reduce emissions of heat - trapping gas from the burning of fossil fuels , such as coal , gas and oil and to encourage local communities to adapt to changes in the climate , as outlined in president @entity370			1
@entity372 are not fans of @entity375 's plan			1
they have dubbed the @entity23 's clean energy push a ' war on coal			1
' they ’ll find various ways , particularly in the @entity23 , to try to stop us from using the authority we have under the @entity382			2
all i would say is that those have zero percent chance of working			0
we ’re committed to moving forward with those rules , ' @entity23 counselor @entity386 told reporters on monday during the @entity23 press briefing			2
@entity23 @entity372 are currently trying to pass legislation that would stop the @entity391 from regulating greenhouse gas emissions			1
the new rules are scheduled to be unveiled next month , and @entity386 said on monday that the @entity391 is on track to meet that deadline .			0

the @entity375 administration released it 's @entity10 on tuesday
the assessment is an *updated* version of a 2013 draft and includes more input from scientists and factors in more than 4,000 public comments
if the @entity75 does not change its *behavior* ' we 're still on the pathway to more damage and danger , ' the report concludes
the report also calls out @entity248 and @entity249 as major contributors to emissions that are causing heat waves that lead to droughts
it also predicts that @entity75 will suffer from more smoke - filled air from more wildfires , smoggy air from pollution , more diseases from tainted food , water , mosquitoes and ticks , and longer allergy seasons as a result of climate change
at the current rate of human activity , temperatures will rise 2 - 4 ° f throughout the next several decades
