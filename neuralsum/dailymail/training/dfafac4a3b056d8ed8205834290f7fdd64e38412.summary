by @entity0 for @entity1 with @entity3 still struggling to decide who will be leading @entity6 's line this season , @entity2 staked his claim with another impressive performance in the @entity10			1
the 21 - year - old scored a superb effort in the first - leg against @entity14 to help @entity6 take a 2 - 1 advantage into the return game at @entity17 on thursday evening			1
with @entity18 rested on the substitute 's bench ahead of sunday 's visit from @entity22 and @entity23 withdrawn from the squad with injury , @entity2 seized the opportunity to impress			2
on target : @entity2 impressed in @entity6 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity14 in the @entity10 competition : @entity23 ( @entity30 ) and @entity18 ( r ) stand in the way of @entity2 's starting place during an energetic 90 minutes , @entity2 had six attempts on goal and scored a superb opener - while his @entity37 map shows his involvement across the pitch and 11 touches in the opposition penalty area			1
the youngster could , and probably should have , opened the scoring after only six minutes when a rash challenge on @entity45 led to the @entity47 keeper @entity46 being replaced and a penalty awarded to the hosts			2
despite the lengthy delay , @entity2 was brave enough to step forward - although his straight down the middle penalty was easily saved			2
@entity54 , to his credit @entity2 did not allow the miss to affect his game as he continued to use his large frame to give the @entity59 defence a torrid time during an industrious first - half display			2
brave : the @entity6 youngster stepped up to take an early penalty but missed from the spot perseverance : @entity2 was rewarded with a beautifully composed opening goal remember the name : @entity2 celebrates after staking a place to become @entity6 's leading striker involved : @entity2 touch map vs @entity14 @entity2 was not afraid to continue asking for the ball despite missing a few more first - half opportunities - including skying a superb chance after being set up with a back heel from @entity76 in the @entity59 's penalty area			1
but , the graduate of @entity6 's youth system , was eventually rewarded for his perseverance just before the stroke of half - time			1
@entity2 raced on to a slide rule pass from @entity85 midfielder @entity84 to cooly slot home @entity6 ' opening goal with a low finish that would have impressed his manager with his composure			1
@entity84 practically secured @entity6 's passage into the next stage of the competition when he drilled home a second within minutes of the re-start			1
@entity6 noticeably eased back after taking a 4 - 1 aggregate lead , with @entity2 's role reduced to holding up the ball and involving others			1
he did have another chance midway through the second - half , showing similar composure as he tried to surprise the keeper with a low effort at the near post that required a smart save			0
spurs were awarded a second penalty on 64 minutes , although another player hoping to earn recognition , @entity111 , argued for the responsibility before effortlessly netting in the bottom right corner			0
boy from @entity85 : @entity84 doubled @entity6 's lead with a strike at the beginning of the second half spot on : @entity119 international @entity111 scored @entity6 's third with a penalty man of the match : @entity2 leaves the field after a performance that would have impressed his manager @entity127 played 90mins goals 1 attempts 6 on target 2 blocked shots 1 @entity129 passes 26 pass completion 73.1 % @entity131 passes 1 @entity2 could have easily had a hat - trick with a series of missed chances in the second - half , including another effort blocked by the feet of the keeper after being sent through by @entity76 and some neat footwork in the box before being dispossesed			1
but he never stopped showing willingness , determination and desire			0
@entity2 was deservedly given man - of - the - match for a performance that accompanied a goal with superb ball retention , constant involvement and an enduring attitude			0
after the game , @entity3 said : ' i have always believed in @entity2 since the first day			0
i think it is possible to miss penalties , but it is not important			0
' he found a way to score , to play and did not let it affect his performance			0
' he showed character and personality			0
he has a very strong mind and @entity2 is a very good player , too			0
' with @entity23 's future at the club remaining uncertain before the close of the january transfer widow and @entity18 's reputation for inconsistency , @entity2 's stock at @entity17 is rising with every goal scored			2
