most parents ca n’t wait to fill their @entity2 pages with endless snaps of their newborn baby or tiny toddler			0
and now taking pictures of your child has never been easier , thanks to the new @entity11 app created by software developer and doting father @entity13			1
attracting your baby ’s attention with rattling sounds you can custom yourself , and animal pictures , once the smartphone is picked up and touch detected , it takes the picture in colour and stores it on your phone			1
software developer @entity13 used his six - month - old daughter ( left ) as the ' face ' of his @entity11 smartphone app ( pictured here ) @entity13 , pictured here with his baby daughter , created the @entity11 app @entity13 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , a software developer and founder of photo sharing app @entity37 , used his six - month - old daughter as the face of @entity11			1
he tells @entity40 of @entity41 that he wanted to facilitate a ' mash up ' of his roles at work and home by creating the app. ' @entity11 started out as a much more ambitious project that was going to try to determine when a baby was smiling , and report back to parents what the baby liked , ' he says			2
the @entity11 app attracts the baby with sounds and pictures , then automatically snaps and stores a photo ' but as i was working on that , the much simpler idea of @entity11 arose , and seemed like a good starting point to gauge interest			1
' the app , which costs 60p to download to any @entity62 with a front - facing camera , describes itself as ‘ @entity64 with a camera twist ' and uses customisable drawings and fun sounds to grab your baby 's attention and ' surprise ' them			1
the images and sounds capture the baby ’s reaction , producing what @entity13 says will be a ' unique , unexpected photo that you ’ll love to share			1
’ using rattling sounds , which you can custom design using the smartphone ’s settings , animated pictures of owls , puppies and other animals will appear to attract the baby ’s attention			1
once they touch the screen , the camera identifies where your baby is and takes a quick snap			1
a message then pops up on your homescreen so you know how many photos were taken , and where they are stored ( @entity11 automatically saves them to your phone ’s gallery )			0
@entity13 told the @entity103 that he expected some ‘ eye - rolling ’ from cynics			0
' hopefully people realise it ’s all in good fun and can provide parents with some fun photos , ' he said			0
' i think it ’s good because it engages parents and babies with the screen , it ’s not really something where you can park your kid in front of it and walk away			0
' in an age where we are seemingly obsessed by selfies ( and pet selfies , butt selfies , exercise selfies ... ) , it was only a matter of time before the @entity11 was invented			0
but @entity13 is quick to point out that the app is more of a hobby for him than a solid investment			2
' no one is getting rich off of @entity11 , ' he told @entity41			0
' we 've sold enough to buy my daughter a box or two of @entity139 so far , so i 'm happy with the results of my little weekend project			0
' @entity11 may be the first tool for photo - loving youngsters , but it 's just part of the growing trend of apps to help ease pregnancy and parenthood			2
@entity149 , a ' pregnancy social platform , ' is currently being developed in the @entity151 and will allow users to share their baby 's heartbeat			2
meanwhile oogababy the self - proclaimed ' @entity155 for babies , ' allows parents to chart everything from new pictures to their child 's weight , height and head circumference .			0
