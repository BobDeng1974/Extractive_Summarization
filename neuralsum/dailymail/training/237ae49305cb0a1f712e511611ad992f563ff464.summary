for years , @entity0 had listened intently to her mother 's stories about her late grandfather 's experiences in @entity5 - but during their last conversation , there was one titbit she 'd never heard before			1
after surviving the @entity12 assault in @entity13 , her grandfather , staff sgt. @entity10 , had left @entity14 with a secret stash of souvenirs - including images of @entity18 as a young man			1
what ? ' @entity20 , a photo editor at @entity21 , wrote in an article for @entity24			1
' my ears pricked up ... snapshots of @entity18 ? now this was a story i had n't heard before			2
' @entity20 sat in amazement as her mother fetched the never - before - seen pictures , which had been stored in a box with other photos , maps and letters upstairs in her parents ' @entity38 home			2
this one is captioned : ' the führer is a friend to animals ' the images - @entity55 propaganda - attempt to depict @entity18 as a kind and respected leader			1
in one image , he pets a fawn with the caption : ' the führer is a friend to animals			0
' another shows him shaking hands with grinning workers , while another shows him meeting wounded @entity71 soldiers			1
an even earlier image shows him alongside comrades at hospital in @entity76			0
@entity18 had spent almost two months at the hospital after being hit by a shell in the @entity78 in october 1916			2
there were also photos showing waving supporters at rallies and children marching in the street as part of the @entity86			2
younger years : @entity18 is pictured back row , second from right during his stay in the hospital in @entity76			1
he was treated there for two months after suffering injuries from an explosion during the @entity78 celebration : @entity18 is pictured in an airplane on his birthday in 1932			2
@entity20 said she learned the photos were part of a set that supporters would collect by using coupons found in cigarette packets ' @entity102 ' : another image in the collection shows him greeting workers @entity20 discovered that each photo came with a patriotic caption			1
' drums which call @entity112 freedom , ' one image of a parade read			0
' chancellor and workers hand in hand , ' another says			0
the photos are rare because , after 1945 , @entity112 governments enforced a law making it illegal to deal in @entity55 propaganda and literature - leaving few collections like this behind			1
the images had been taken for a cigarette picture book entitled ' @entity125 : the @entity126 of the @entity127 ' , @entity20 reported			0
most of the photographs were made by @entity130 , the official photographer of the @entity127			0
the party collaborated with the @entity132 to work on the collection			0
they prepared books containing text and empty spaces for the photos , and smokers would then find coupons for the images inside their cigarette packages			1
they would send the coupon to the company and , in return , get the photos			0
leader : @entity18 ( pictured in the 1930s in an image not found in the collection ) appeared on the cards for @entity55 propaganda , but after his fall , it was illegal to trade the images - making them extremely rare in @entity112 ' in effect , @entity55 trading cards , ' @entity20 wrote			1
her article explains that soldiers have long been ' liberating ' souvenirs from foreign lands , but she has many unanswered questions about the images found by her grandfather , who died 15 years ago			2
' if my grandfather were alive today , i would have so many questions to ask him , ' she wrote			0
' where did he find these cards ? what caused him to pause and pick them up , and why did he bring them back home ? ' i ca n't help but wonder if he shared the same instinct that i have when i come across pictures like these : namely , a deep curiosity , as well as a desire to know more and to share that knowledge			0
' her full article and photo gallery can be seen at @entity24 .			0

time photo editor @entity0 was *shocked* when her mother mentioned images of @entity18 that her late grandfather had brought back from @entity112
the collection shows @entity18 petting animals and meeting workers
supporters could collect the set by sending off coupons found in cigarette packets
dealing @entity55 propaganda became illegal after 1945 , making the photos extremely rare in @entity112
