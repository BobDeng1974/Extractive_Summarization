by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor when journalists saw first lady @entity4 on sunday during her visit to the @entity6 , the few photographers permitted to see the event were forbidden to shoot from an angle that would have produced an unfortunate photo , framing her and her family with a decades - old rock sculpture that reads ' loyal to chairman @entity12			1
' instead , photojournalists were forced to remain on a @entity15 tower between mrs. @entity4 and the 1,300 - foot - wide carving , making that photo impossible to take			2
' photographers and reporters covering the visit were sent ahead to @entity21 ' on the @entity15 , according to a pool report , ' and told they could not move from the top of the tower until told to do so			0
' during the first lady 's visit , photographers were kept away from a vantage point that would have allowed them to capture the @entity35 in a photo like this mrs. @entity4 ( @entity38 ) walked with her daughters @entity35 ( r ) and @entity40 ( c ) on the @entity6 at @entity27 , but the only photographers on the scene were forced to stay between the @entity35 and the communist loyalty message the stones , stacked by @entity45 in the late 1960s , were covered with brush until 2008 , when the government cleared the vegetation and repainted them in time for the 2008 @entity50 ' because of where we were positioned , ' the pool journalist wrote , ' they could only be photographed with scenery to the south of @entity21			1
had photographers been able to shoot from @entity59 as the family walked north , the photographs would have captured them walking the wall with a massive rock inscription on the hillside above them to the north , which read in @entity67 characters , " loyal to chairman @entity12			1
" ' this reporter visited the same section of the @entity6 in the summer of 2009 , and photographed the rock inscription			1
a tour guide who visits the @entity6 at least once each week said at the time that @entity45 had built the inscription out of quarried stone in the late 1960s and painted them white with lime			1
but in the 40 years that followed , the paint wore away and brush grew to cover the rocks			0
just months before the @entity80 , @entity67 government officials ordered a refurbishment of the site			0
vegetation was removed and the rocks were repainted			0
reached for comment , the tour guide told @entity87 that she was on the same section of the @entity6 on saturday , the day before the @entity35 arrived			1
' i had a client and we went up on the @entity27 section , ' she said , ' and one of the gondola operators told me he had been instructed to make sure the first lady 's family was n't traveling up to the top until the security guards told him everything was all set ' – likely meaning that the press was situated in their prescribed place			2
forbidden : t - shirts like this were yanked from sale in peddlers ' stalls near the @entity6 when the @entity35 came to visit carefully scripted : the first lady 's visit to the @entity6 was choreographed by @entity1 and @entity67 security forces , with order maintained by local government police watchful eye : access to the @entity27 section of the @entity15 was controlled by security forces while the @entity35 were there @entity121 agents , including some @entity122 , watched closely as @entity4 and her daughters walked with a group of pre-screened tourists			1
( can you spot them ? ) ' this happens when important people visit			0
we do n't want to take to them to the @entity132 section of the @entity6 because it is too crowded			2
they ca n't shoo everyone away , and they also ca n't protect the dignitaries , ' she added			0
' the all - seeing eyes : @entity121 were carefully positioned in front of the @entity35 and behind them at every step ' but [ the ] @entity27 [ section ] , you know , has the @entity12 rock carving			2
so that becomes difficult as well , especially for @entity147			0
i 'm sure the photographers were forbidden from taking an embarrassing picture			2
' news outlets had a field day on sunday with a dispatch from the same pool reporter that noted how vendors near the @entity6 at @entity27 were instructed to hide popular t - shirts merging president @entity157 and @entity67 founder @entity12			1
mrs. @entity4 's hotel stay in @entity159 was also marked by controversy , with a well - placed staffer at the @entity162 telling @entity87 that her mother had been ' barking at the staff since she arrived			1
' the careful scripting of the first lady 's @entity67 trip stands in stark contrast with a statement she made to the @entity67 news outlet @entity172 before the journey began			0
' we get plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens – but we would n't trade it for anything in the world , ' she said			0
' mrs. @entity4 has n't taken any questions from journalists since she landed in @entity67 .			0
