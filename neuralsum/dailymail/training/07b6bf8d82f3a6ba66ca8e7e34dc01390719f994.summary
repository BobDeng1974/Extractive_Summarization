they are the serious - minded protesters who have taken to the streets in outrage at the killings of black men @entity4 and @entity6 by the police			1

at cities across the country , almost every frame of a ' die - in ' protest features at least one participant bathed in the white light of their cell phones , rather than playing dead			1
the die - ins are designed to raise awareness and express outrage at the cases of @entity6 , who was shot dead in @entity51 , @entity52 , by officer @entity53 in august			1
in november a grand jury declined to indict the officer , a decision which prompted a tide of outrage from civil rights activists , who made calls for legal reform			2
@entity4 , a man killed on @entity61 , @entity31 , by the @entity62 , who put him in a choke - hold this summer , has also been incorporated in many of the protests			1
playing ' dead ' : three students in this corridor at one of @entity70 's campuses did n't get the memo about laying still spotted : two protesters on the ground can be seen bathed in the light of their devices , with the @entity76 in the background a grand jury decided wednesday that no charges would be brought in relation to his death as well			1

' images of the die - ins from all over the country have been shared			0
events in @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity24 , @entity31 and @entity103 have all featured on major news outlets			2
