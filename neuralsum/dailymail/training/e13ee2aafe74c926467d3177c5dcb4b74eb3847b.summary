by @entity0 the winter solstice is the shortest day of the year , which marks the transition to longer daylight hours - but for some - it holds more importance than simply seeing more sunshine			1
for the 20 people living on the @entity9 in @entity10 , mid-winters day is the halfway point of their stay on the continent , and they celebrate in a very unique way			1
each year , to celebrate the equinox and the middle of their expedition , but also to honor those who have been down before them , members of the @entity9 dive into icy waters			2
it takes the whole day prior to prepare the ' pool ' as ' the sea ice here at the moment is one metre deep , so it did take a while for them to get those chunks of ice out , ' ms @entity34 says			0
appropriate clothing : one of the staff can be seen preparing to jump into the 1.8 degree water in just his yellow board shorts and shoes warming up : the sea water is substantially warmer than the -32 degree air temperature then , on the morning of the solstice staff take the plunge , stripping off in sub-zero temperatures to immerse themselves in comparatively warmer waters			1
following this , they enjoy a more pleasant experience in an outdoor spa created especially for the celebrations			0
a formal dinner ' toasting all those who have been down before it , and family and friends back home who we have n't seen for quite some time ' concludes the evening			2
waiting for the sun : it will be mid-july before anyone in @entity10 sees the sun again that 's better ! a dip in the spa warms people up after the morning chilly adventure group photo : some of the researchers pose for a photo to wish everyone a ' happy mid-winters ' making light of the fact no one on the continent will see a ship , or any vessel for that matter , until november , ms @entity34 takes a dig at her loved ones for not making the trip to join them for the event			1
' we did send an invitation out to many people to attend our party tonight , lot 's of excuses why they ca n't get here ... probably because it 's impossible			0
' the winter months in world 's southern most continent are extremely cold and dark , and the 20 individuals who are currently working at the station will return home at the end of this year			0
from @entity122 onwards the days will get longer in @entity10 , ' which we 're all looking forward to , even though it will only just pop its head up briefly ... until it hangs around a bit longer as the year goes on , ' ms @entity34 says			0
living quarters : away from friends and family for a long time , this team will head home at the end of the year down time : the quarters feature a pool table and other activities going solo : not a single ship nor vessel will be able to reach @entity10 until november			2

researchers at the @entity9 in @entity10 celebrate the winter solstice by taking a dip in 2 degree water
the mid-winter day marks the halfway point one of the coldest continents
their ' swim ' is followed by a much more pleasant bonding *session* in a specially made spa
at the end of the day , staff have a formal dinner to *remember* those who came down before them
