by @entity0 published : 02:53 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 24 april 2013 a female member of the @entity2 has revealed how seven years in the service left her five stone overweight			1
@entity5 , 34 , was a radar operator in the @entity2 and spent most of her time outnumbered by men			1
but just as her male colleagues would wind down by drinking pints of beer and eating takeaways , so @entity5 would join in			1
the unhealthy lifestyle quickly saw her pile on the pounds			2
@entity5 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , admits that during her seven years in the @entity2 she was the life and soul of the party and would match her male colleagues drink for drink and then go for a curry afterwards			1
@entity5 drinking on a night out in her past life ( left ) and looking radiant on holiday with her new figure ( right ) @entity5 , who was honoured with an @entity25 and served her country all over the world. , says she loved her job - but saw the @entity2 lifestyle took a real toll on her figure as she ate and drank more and saw her weight soar out of control			1
when she joined she was a slim size ten , super-fit and weighed just 10st 2lb with a 29 inch waist			1
when she left seven years later , her weight had shot up to 14st 10lb , she was a size 18 with a 42 inch waist			2
' i used to eat and drink like a bloke , ' she says			2
@entity5 knew she had to turn her life around and decided to regain the figure she had when she was a new naval recruit			1
she admits that her diet at the time was a bit of a disaster			2
' i hated being overweight			0
it stripped me of a lot of my natural confidence , ' said @entity5			1
' i hit rock bottom and realised i needed to change			0
' she started going to the gym and swapped her bad diet for healthy food			1
@entity5 puts her success in part down to @entity57 - a diet supplement used by @entity59 and @entity60 that is said to suppress appetite and speed up metabolism			1
in her @entity2 days , @entity5 was one of lads , matching them drink for drink - and then joining in with a curry ' the real spur to lose weight came when i saw my figure changing and how much better i looked , ' she says			1
' the weight came off me fairly easily and i was seeing a real change in my outlook and how other people perceived me			0
it was really quite inspiring			0
' her weight decreased from 14 stone to just above 10 stone			0
@entity5 loved her new appearance so much that she completely changed her image			1
ditching the capacious , frumpy dresses she wore to hide her body , @entity5 started stepping out in boob tubes and other funkier clothes			1
the one downside of all the weight loss was that her breasts ' disappeared '			2
' they had shot up to a @entity88 when i was overweight , ' said @entity5			1
' but once i had lost the weight my boobs were just empty and had no definition			0
so i had a boob job and went up to a @entity94 to get my figure back			2
' though she admits : ' i think i overdid slightly because they are too big now			1
' after shedding the pounds @entity5 has revealed a stunning new look complete with cropped hairstyle and fitted clothes which show off her tanned new figure			1
the newly single @entity5 also noticed a different reaction from men immediately			2
toned and tanned , @entity5 has found a new man after shedding the pounds and increasing her bust ' i 'd walk into a bar and just know that i was being looked at			2
it did wonders for my confidence and finally i was dating men who i had chosen rather than the other way around			0
it was liberating to be completely in charge of my own destiny , ' she said			0
pretty and fun - loving , @entity5 , was never short of a boyfriend , even at her heaviest			2
but one crucial fact meant she was unlikely to find happiness			0
' i used to go out with whoever wanted to go out with me - not the other way around , ' she said			0
' i settled down with one man because i was fat and i was worried i was going to get left on the shelf			0
basically i was always settling for second best			0
' but just months after achieving her ideal weight and after her breast operation , @entity5 met the man of her dreams on a night out			1
things have gone from strength to strength and the happy couple now live together in @entity16			2
the @entity57 pills @entity5 used to help her slim suppress the appetite and release caffeine for energy and to increase resting metabolism			1
they claim to allows users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising			0
' they do n't just work on their own - you have to combine them with exercise and a good diet , ' said @entity5			1
' but they make such a difference			0
just when you are feeling peckish in between meals you take a pill and it takes your mind off food			0
they really helped me to get down to my idea weight			0
' now i am at 10 stone i still take them to keep my weight steady			0
i have my weight under control with the changes in my lifestyle			0
i will never be fat again			0
' @entity5 has also finally met the man of her dreams and has never been happier			2
' everything is good in my life			0
i am so thrilled with how things have turned out , ' she said			0
@entity167 confident @entity5 owes her slimline look to a diet and exercise regime plus supplements			1

@entity5 from @entity16 joined the @entity2 at 10st but *spiralled* to 15st
she started a diet , exercise and supplement regime to slim back to 10st
her breasts had ' emptied ' so she got a breast *enlargement* up to a @entity180
says she slightly overdid it because they are ' too big '
