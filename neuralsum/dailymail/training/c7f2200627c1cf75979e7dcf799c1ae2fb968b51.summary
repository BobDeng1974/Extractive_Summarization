by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 have won this year 's @entity4 in chemistry for laying the foundation for the computer models used to understand and predict chemical processes			1
the @entity9 said their research in the 1970s has helped scientists develop programs that unveil chemical processes such as the purification of exhaust fumes or the photosynthesis in green leaves			1
that kind of knowledge makes it possible to optimise catalysts for cars , drugs and solar cells , the academy said			1
' previously , chemists had to choose to use either / or			0
' @entity1 , a @entity39 and @entity40 citizen , is affiliated with the @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			2
the academy said @entity2 is a @entity45 , @entity39 , and @entity46 citizen and a professor at the @entity48			2
@entity3 is a @entity39 and @entity46 citizen affiliated with the @entity49 in @entity50			2
the @entity52 winners found a new way for computers to model proteins ( pictured ) and their interactions in the human body @entity3 told a news conference in @entity59 by telephone that he was ' extremely happy ' to be awakened in the middle of the night in @entity50 to find out he had won the prize , and looks forward to collecting the award in the @entity65 capital in december			1
' in short what we developed is a way which requires computers to look , to take the structure of the protein and then to eventually understand how exactly it does what it does , ' @entity3 said			1
when scientists wanted to simulate complex chemical processes on computers they used to have to choose between software that was based on either classical @entity80 physics or quantum physics			1
but the academy said the three laureates developed computer models that ' opened a gate between these two worlds			0
' @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 ( left to right ) give a press conference to announce the laureates of the 2013 @entity4 the strength of their methods is that they can be used to study all kinds of chemistry , it said			0
' scientists can optimise solar cells , catalysts in motor vehicles or even drugs , to take but a few examples , ' the academy said			1
@entity106 , president of the @entity107 , was enthusiastic about the award			0
' i think it 's fabulous , ' she said in a telephone interview			0
' they 're talking about the partnering of theoreticians with experimentalists , and how this has led to greater understanding			0
' that is ' bringing better understanding to problems that could n't be solved experimentally , ' she said			0
' we 're starting as scientists to better understand things like how pharmaceutical drugs interact with proteins in our body to treat diseases			2
this is very , very exciting			0
' earlier this week , three @entity39 won the @entity4 in medicine for discoveries about how key substances are moved around within cells and the physics award went to @entity45 and @entity136 scientists whose theories help explain how matter formed after the @entity138			0
the work of @entity33 , @entity2 and @entity3 has laid the foundations for new kinds of pharmaceuticals			1

@entity144 was awarded to @entity2 , @entity1 and @entity3
their work has helped develop computers to unveil chemical processes
among other things , these processes have laid the foundations for new pharmaceuticals , optimised catalysts for cars and improved solar cells
