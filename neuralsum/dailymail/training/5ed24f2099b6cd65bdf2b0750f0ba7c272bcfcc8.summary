great expectations : bake off is making @entity3 's children expect perfect cakes at home my son , aged six , is furious with me			1
the gingerbread men are a ' flippin ’ disaster ' , he says , hand on hip , accusingly			1
it 's raining , it ’s sunday , what are we doing ? we 're cooking , of course			1
they 're one - legged , burnt at the edges and as inedible as polystyrene			1
@entity22 , aged two ‑ and - a - half , regards them suspiciously			1
' idiots , ' she says			1
it 's her new word , which is oddly appropriate on this occasion but was wholly inappropriate in the queue at @entity28 earlier ( i do n't know where she picked that one up )			2
frankly , the boy does n’t understand the pressure i 'm under or he would n’t be so harsh			2
i blame the bloody @entity34 - it 's making parenting even harder			1
this is a generation of children who know what the word ' consistency ' means			1
my son expects me to throw a few bits in a bowl and pull a star - baker souffle out of the oven			2
the gingerbread men - who look like escapees from the broken biscuit factory - are a let - down , but worse still , they make him question all my parenting skills			1
i can see him thinking : ' why should i go to bed on time for a woman who ca n't make biscuits ? ' @entity57 , you just made jam tarts ( with pre-prepared pastry ) with your kids			2
but because every other tv show is a cook ‑ off , now they expect @entity63 ( and @entity64 ) to have culinary super-powers			1
i think my son would be more impressed if i managed to cook a firm meringue than if i beat @entity68 in the 5,000 metres ( the latter is more likely )			2
@entity69 is doubling my maternal stress - i am not equipped to deliver the expectation it has created - and unless @entity73 becomes a hit tv series some time soon , i will continue to fail in the eyes of my ' kid critics ' , as they have dubbed themselves			1
queen of cakes : @entity79 at meal times the four of them have started to ' mark ' their tea out loud , like @entity86 judges : my roast potatoes got nine out of ten on sunday , but the homemade gravy got a grim two ( what can i say - we 'd run out of @entity91 )			1
the eldest even wants to start a cooking blog			2
if she does that , people will start to question if we really are related given my lack of expertise			2
she 's been inspired by a girl who started critiquing her @entity100 school dinners at the age of nine			0
@entity103 's blog became an internet sensation and she won @entity106 person of the year in the 2012 @entity107			0
our 11 - year - old wants a piece of that pie , but apart from setting up the blog - which i can do - there 's nothing more i can contribute ( i am the woman who once grilled a frozen chicken leg )			0
and cooking brings out the worst in me			0
i 'm impatient , hot - tempered and illogical			0
it was only when i had the third child that i realised i did n't have to do all the things i hated just because they wanted to do it			0
i wo n't play @entity122 ( it 's boring ) or computer games ( they can do that with @entity64 )			0
but i love sticking , gluing , glitter and drawing			0
i love a swimming pool or an indoor play centre			0
swings and roundabouts , as they say			0
however , on sunday i broke my ' ca n't cook , wo n’t cook ' rule for the gingerbread men - we 'd run out of films to watch and games to play and , annoyingly , we had all the necessary ingredients			0
we followed the instructions , and apart from the chilled ball of dough dropping on the floor and being nosed around by the dog for a few seconds , i have no idea why they turned out to be mutants			0
' we would never win anything with those , ' the children chorused			1
' idiots , ' @entity22 concluded			0
@entity149 is editor ‑ in - chief of @entity151 .			0

tv baking guru is making parenting harder
children expect all mums and dads to be able to create cakes like @entity79
