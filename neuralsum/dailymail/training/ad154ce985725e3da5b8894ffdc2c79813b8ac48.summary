@entity1 narcotics chief : @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are comparable to @entity5 and @entity6 for their ' no - go ' areas badly managed large scale immigration fuels the problem ' drug traffickers , organised crime , drug users - they take over ' celebrity use of drugs is helping to ' normalise use ' in society @entity18 says it does ' not recognise the reference to " no go " areas in the @entity21 ' @entity21 cities have lawless ‘ no - go areas ’ comparable with the most dangerous parts of @entity5 , @entity6 and the @entity26 , according to a @entity1 drugs chief			1
professor @entity27 claimed @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity2 are on a par with the drug and murder capitals of the world			1
the president of the @entity33 said the police had lost control of parts of these cities , and drugs gangs had taken over			2
eleven - year - old @entity38 was one victim of the drug and gang culture permeating @entity21			1
the youngster was shot in the car park of a pub , in @entity44 , @entity4 , in august 2007 after innocently being caught up in a turf war between rival gangs			1
rhys was killed as he walked through a pub car park on his way home from football training			0
@entity38 , then aged 16 , was aiming at members of a rival gang when he blasted @entity55 by mistake			0
members of @entity59 ’s @entity58 helped him cover up his horrific crime			2
@entity55 was shot with a @entity62 and @entity63 revolver , and a gang - member was caught trying to buy a replacement weapon just weeks later			2
@entity38 was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years			0
but his comments caused fury from police and community leaders			0
@entity72 , @entity73 mp for @entity74 , said : ‘ i walk the streets of @entity2 on a regular basis			1
it is not the same as @entity78 , it is not the same as @entity80			0
‘ he is either ignorant or stupid			0
if hehas surveyed my city from the decadence of a five - star hotel room then he may well draw those conclusions			2
‘ if he had come out with me on the streets he would see that people are living happily and peacefully			0
’ @entity4 council leader @entity88 said : ‘ anyone who knows @entity4 will not recognise the city from the way in which this report is being interpreted			1
' the comparisons are fanciful and it is absurd to say any part of the city is a no - go area			2
’ ahead of the publication of the @entity33 ’s annual report on drugs around the world , professor @entity27 said urgent action was needed because parts of the @entity21 were experiencing ‘ social disintegration ’			1
the @entity106 - born doctor claimed that @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity2 were experiencing ‘ a vicious cycle of social exclusion and drugs problems and fractured communities ’			1
‘ in many societies around the world , whether developed or developing , there are communities within the societies which develop which become no - go areas , ’ he went on			1
‘ drug traffickers , organised crime , drug users , they take over			1
they will get the sort of governance of those areas			2
‘ examples are in @entity5 , @entity6 , in the @entity26 , in the @entity21 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity2 , and therefore it is no good to have only law enforcement , which always shows it does not succeed			1
‘ it is crucial that the needs of communities experiencing social disintegration are urgently tackled before the tipping point is reached , beyond which effective action becomes impossible			0
‘ the consequences of failure are too high for society and should be avoided at all cost			2
’ one example of the scourge of drugs in @entity4 was a family of drug dealers and their associates , last november were jailed for a total of 82 years for peddling heroin and crack cocaine on the streets of @entity4			1
@entity148 and @entity149 , part of the ' drug family ' , were jailed for four and eight years respectively as the net closed on the drug dealers , officers found an @entity156 assault rifle which had been stolen from army barracks on @entity158 in 2005 , around 1,200 rounds of ammunition as well as a large quantity of @entity163 substances			1
thirteen people involved in running a 24 - hour drugs cash and carry service were jailed after months of surveillance			1
undercover officers from @entity169 posed as addicts to make ' test purchases ' to gain the necessary evidence as undercover officers filmed the footage			0
his comments were undermined by statistics showing the wildly differing crime rates between cities in @entity180 and @entity181			2
for example , the metropolitan area of @entity183 , which contains vast sprawling slums , saw 4,631 murders in 2009 , including scores at the hands of drug dealers			2
in contrast , there were 35 murders in @entity2 in 2009 - 10 – a record low – and 27 in the @entity194			1
the @entity2 police force boasts a 96.8 per cent detection rate for murders			1
officials in @entity183 estimate there have been 60,000 unsolved murders in the past decade , including 24,000 where the body was unidentified			0
senior police officers also dismissed the claims			0
@entity206 , the chief constable of @entity208 and the @entity18 ’ drugs spokesman said : ‘ i simply do not recognise the reference to “ no - go ” areas in the @entity21			1
it appears to be set in the broader context of social cohesion			0
’ assistant chief constable @entity214 of @entity215 said : ‘ i am sure that the majority of people in @entity2 will wholeheartedly reject any suggestion that parts of the city are “ no - go ” areas			1
‘ we accept that drugs are a major driving force behind many other crimes such as burglary , robbery and vehicle crime , and that is why we are determined to root out all those involved ’			1
@entity169 said it ‘ absolutely disagreed ’ there are any ‘ no - go areas ’ in @entity4 or elsewhere in the force area			1
illegal internet pharmacies are targeting young people online through sites such as @entity237 and @entity238 , a @entity1 drugs chief warned today			1
professor @entity27 , president of the @entity1 ’s @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , said illegal internet pharmacies were becoming ' very sophisticated ' in approaching young people on social media sites , leaving them ' very vulnerable ' online			1
he warned young people to be aware of whom they were talking to and interacting with on the internet			0
' disturbingly , illegal internet pharmacies have started to use social media to publicise their websites , which can put large audiences at risk of dangerous products , ' prof @entity27 said			2
the @entity247 ( @entity247 ) has found more than half of medicines from internet pharmacies are counterfeit , he added			0
' this has become really rather sinister now , ' he said , ' it is much more widespread than you can believe it is			0
' international illicit pharmacies are using social media and they are not just coming overtly as they used to do , advertising their selling of illicit drugs to you , they do it under a variety ( of different ways )			0
' they use @entity238 , they use @entity237 , they attract you to their website ... then when you go there you will see they are also selling illicit drugs			0
' particularly young people , they become very vulnerable in using internet pharmacies			0
' prof @entity27 went on : ' a few years ago it was direct , it was the internet selling all sorts of controlled drugs			0
' but now actually they are using the social media , engaging people in a variety of ways which in the first instance you do not see they are marketing the drug			0
' but then , in a very sophisticated way , they are getting the right question on to @entity238 , on to @entity237 , and even chatting in the chatrooms , they get engaged , and then bombard them with drugs			0
' the @entity33 annual report added that the illegal firms took steps to ensure they looked legitimate , ' providing quotes and images of purported medical doctors '			0
but it added that the firms had turned to ' message board and social network advertising ' after several internet search engines banned the use of registered trademarks for prescription drugs in their sponsored links			0
more than half ( 58 per cent ) of the 12,000 seizures of controlled substances sent via the mail in 2010 were from @entity305 , with others from the @entity26 , @entity307 and @entity308 , and ' some of course in the @entity21 ' , prof @entity27 added .			2

@entity1 narcotics chief : @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are comparable to @entity5 and @entity6 for their ' no - go ' areas
badly managed large scale immigration fuels the problem
' drug traffickers , organised crime , drug users - they take over '
celebrity use of drugs is helping to ' normalise use ' in society
@entity18 says it does ' not recognise the reference to " no go " areas in the @entity21 '
