but for the last four decades , it has been an industry in decline			0
smoking peaked in the @entity7 in 1974 , and as smokers either cut down or gave up , with many switching to smoke - free e-cigarettes , manufacturers in @entity7 have steadily reduced their workforces			2
now only @entity45 ( @entity45 ) 's @entity44 cigarette plant in @entity46 , @entity47 , remains			2
imperial chief executive @entity48 said the @entity2 closures were part of a money - saving drive to save £ 300million a year from september 2018			1
she said : ' the prospect of job losses is always regrettable and we will be doing all we can to support employees and ensure that they are treated in a fair and responsible manner			0
' @entity1 , which also makes @entity58 and @entity59 cigarettes , said cigarette production in @entity20 was declining due to ‘ tough economic conditions ’ , as well as increased regulation , higher taxes and smuggling			1
falling sales : sales of cigarettes in the @entity7 have plummeted by 42 per cent since 2000 ( file picture ) tougher advertising regulations have made conditions harder for tobacco firms - this advert is from the 1930s the company also announced the closure of sites in @entity77 including a factory in @entity79 and a research and development facility in @entity81 , taking the total job losses to 900			1
the @entity2 and @entity77 plants will close over the next two years , and production will be relocated to factories in @entity86 and @entity87 , with distribution being outsourced			1

the girl made her living by catching a man 's eye and selling him not only cigarettes but also matches , lighters , and novelty items			0
what she wore influenced how often she was called over , so cigarette girls tended to wear revealing or alluring clothes , such as a bodice , short tutu - style skirt , and high heels			2
cigarette girls still work in some nightclubs and restaurants , but their heyday has now passed			0
@entity1 , the world 's fourth - largest international tobacco company by market share , aims to launch two electronic cigarettes this year			1
they are safer than traditional cigarettes but also face the prospect of additional government regulation			0
the company , which has 46 manufacturing sites and 35,000 staff in 160 countries , closed a cigar factory in @entity133 in 2010			2
the @entity135 union , which represents tobacco workers in @entity2 , said the announcement was a devastating blow to the workforce and the city ’s economy			2
@entity143 official @entity142 said : ‘ gmb will oppose this closure as we believe the work of producing 17billion cigarettes in @entity2 each year is being migrated east to the @entity87 factory as a cynical ploy to increase profits and for no other reason			2
‘ this company made no less than £ 3.18billion profits last year and to make even more money it is simply walking away from @entity2			2
’ smoking is the biggest single cause of illness and premature death in the @entity7 , and causes the death of 100,000 people in @entity7 every single year			2
first introduced to @entity7 in 1586 by colonists from @entity163 in the @entity102 , tobacco was initially criticised by @entity164 who , in his 1602 pamphlet @entity166 , claimed that smoking was a sin			2
but despite his best attempts , the popularity of tobacco spread , and its alleged health - giving powers meant it was sold not only at taverns but at chemists , too			0
it rose in fashion during the 17th and 18th centuries , and duty on tobacco rose accordingly as the government came to value tobacco excise as a valuable source of income			0
big employer : the @entity185 cigarette firm in @entity133 began in 1786 and employed thousands of men and women with the tobacco being imported from overseas , major ports such as @entity189 , @entity133 , @entity190 and @entity191 became centres of the cigarette manufacturing industry			1
in @entity133 , @entity195 - founded in 1786 - was one of the biggest tobacco firms , and one of the first to make cigarettes			0
as the firm grew , so did the number of people it employed , and the company pioneered worker benefits such as health care , paid holidays and canteens			0
@entity190 had the @entity209 , while in @entity191 two ' tobacco lairds ' , @entity211 and @entity212 , made a fortune importing tobacco from the colonies			0
@entity1 's history in @entity2 dates back to 1877 , when @entity217 bought a small tobacco manufacturing business in @entity219			1
it has been at its current site in the city since 1972			0
women , such as these at an @entity1 factory in the 1930s , were often hired by tobacco firms in 1876 @entity229 received its first royal warrant from @entity231 , @entity232 , and by the 1880s , tobacco manufacturers in @entity189 alone were estimated to make up a quarter of all the manufacturers in @entity7			1
in 1902 @entity235 ( @entity235 ) was formed as a joint venture between @entity7 's @entity1 and the @entity237			1
but ten years later , the first connection was made between smoking and lung cancer by a @entity241			0
it did n't stop cigarettes being included in soldiers ' ration packs during the @entity246 , though , while manufacturer @entity247 started targeting women with their cigarette advertising in 1925			0
cigarette adverts : @entity7 - made @entity252 's used a cherubic toddler before health warnings became mandatory by the 1950s , medical studies found a definite link between smoking and lung cancer , and by 1971 all packets of cigarettes sold in the @entity7 had to carry health warnings			1
the first @entity261 was organised in 1989 , and in july 2007 a ban on smoking in pubs , bars , restaurants and all enclosed workplace came into force			0
cigarette sales , which peaked in @entity7 in 1974 , fell from 94.4billion in the @entity7 in 1991 to 55.5billion in 2001 and 42billion in 2011 thanks to increased awareness of associated health risks , as well at tighter advertising regulations and higher tax			1
initially included in cigarette packs to stiffen the packaging , cigarette cards soon became desirable in their own right as people sought to collect full sets			0
while early versions simply bore the cigarette manufacturer 's logo or name , they were soon released in thematic sets , with , for example , famous footballers or battleships drawn on them			0
this set of cigarette cards depicting @entity291 of @entity292 was produced by @entity293 in 1935 in @entity7 , the @entity133 - based @entity185 firm introduced cigarette cards first , in 1887 , followed by @entity217 in 1893 and @entity190 's @entity296 a couple of years after that			1
cards typically came in sets of 25 or 50 , and complete sets would sell for large sums at specialist auctions , with collectors paying up to £ 11,000 for a single , rare card .			0
