sir @entity0 has revealed it took him just 10 seconds to turn down the @entity3 job			1
the former @entity5 manager was approached twice by the @entity6 to take over the national side , first in 1999 prior to the appointment of @entity9 and then in 2001 before @entity10 was given the job			1
and , speaking at the launch of his new book , @entity12 , @entity0 admitted he did n't have to think twice before rejecting the opportunity			1
video : sir @entity0 on turning down @entity3 main man : sir @entity0 prepares to speak ahead of the launch of his latest book , my autobiography second choice : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 took over after @entity0 turned down @entity3 job ' it was my great opportunity in life to relegate them , ' he said			1
' there was no way i could have taken the job			1
@entity27 was the first one to come			1
we met at @entity29 and he made an offer			2
' it did n’t take me long [ to turn it down ] – 10 seconds			2
i thought about it for 10 seconds			2
never in a million years could i manage @entity3			1
think of me going back to @entity34			2
' in his book , @entity0 also described the job as a ' bed of nails			1
' he went on to admit he expects an immediate response from @entity41 after claiming the former @entity29 captain 's personality changed towards the end of his time at the club			1
he wrote of the ‘ relief ’ that was felt in the dressing room when the man with ‘ the most savage tongue ’ left the club in a blaze of controversy in 2005 after his dominance in the midfield began to wane			2
the final straw , however , was @entity41 ’s explosive interview on the club ’s official channel , @entity60 , in november 2005			1
happier days : @entity0 's relationship with @entity41 deteriorated before the midfielder left the club in 2005 and @entity0 is now braced for the @entity65 's comeback			1
' the nature of the man you can expect that , ' he said at his launch			2
' that is the type of personality @entity72 is			1
the reason i had to explain it : it happened so quick , his actions were so quick			2
for one reason or another he decided to criticise his own team - mates			2
we could n’t release the video			0
' two of our young players got booed at a match and we decided we had to do something			0
i could n’t lose my control in his particular situation			0
if i had of let it pass the players would have viewed me differently			0
throughout my career i ’ve been strong enough			0
' @entity72 overstepped his mark and there was no other thing we could do			0
we did well by him , paid up his contract , gave him a testimonial in front of 75,000 people			0
we did everything to honour the player he was for @entity5			1
' revelations : @entity0 's new book documents his exceptional spell as manager of @entity5 blame game : @entity0 believes @entity107 began to change when he met , and married , @entity108 ( below ) my autobiography by sir @entity0 published by @entity111 on october 24 , priced £ 25 @entity0 , who was speaking in central @entity112 , also expanded on his relationship with @entity107 , claiming the former @entity3 captain changed after he met his future wife @entity108			1
' the big problem for me , i ’m a football man , he fell in love with @entity108 – that changed everything			1
being a football man , i had to think about where we were going for that , ' he added			0
' if he had asked my advice when he left @entity124 for @entity125 i would have told him exactly what i thought			0
how can you leave @entity124 for @entity125 ? ' he reinvented himself a couple of times to go to @entity131 then @entity132			0
that ’s because of his natural stamina			0
at the end i think he did miss the big time football			0
maybe in a couple of years he ’ll look back and think that			0
i do n’t think i ’ve been critical of @entity107			1
' how can i argue with how he ’s turned out as a human being ? i thought he was a marvellous guy			0
when he joined us at 12 years of age he had this fantastic ambition to be a footballer			0
it was a wonderful period for @entity5			1
' he worked to the point where he became a great player			0
we made the right decision to let him go to @entity124 – we felt it was the right time			0
