captain @entity17 : dramatic accounts of the @entity2 rescuing the captain of an @entity5 cargo ship made headlines around the world in 2009 recounting his story : president @entity22 meets with @entity17 , captain of the @entity5 cargo ship @entity25 that was hijacked by pirates off the @entity28 coast , and his wife @entity29 in the @entity30 of the @entity31 it was an unbelievable story , with a new retelling that hits the big screen friday with @entity35 playing capt. @entity17			1
but the official version that unfolded in the @entity37 was n't as tidy as @entity38 's , or the versions in @entity17 ' own book or in contemporaneous news reports			2
in fact , many more than three shots were fired , $ 30,000 went missing and the integrity of the @entity2 was questioned			1
the unvarnished story begins on april 8 , 2009			1
four armed @entity47 pirates scurried up the side of a large cargo ship , @entity25 , and took the crew , including @entity17 , hostage			1
rescued : captain @entity17 stands alongside @entity52			2
@entity53 , commanding officer of @entity54 after being rescued by @entity55 april 12 , 2009 off the coast of @entity47 captive : @entity17 was held hostage by suspected @entity47 pirates in the lifeboat for five days after a failed hijacking attempt off the @entity47 coast			1
three of the pirates were killed and one captured in the firefight that freed @entity67 in a failed attempt to get the pirates to leave , @entity17 gave them $ 30,000 from the ship safe			1
the pirates eventually abandoned the @entity72 , jumping into a lifeboat and taking the cash and @entity17 at gunpoint			1
the @entity54 , a destroyer that had responded to the hijacking , gave chase as the pirates headed toward the @entity47 coast			2
days later , a team of @entity2 parachuted into the @entity37 and boarded the @entity54			1
during the crisis , the @entity81 persuaded the pirates to let the @entity54 tow the lifeboat and then tricked the fourth pirate into coming aboard the @entity54			2
as the @entity54 reeled in the lifeboat for a better shot , the @entity2 took up positions on the back of the warship and trained their sights on the three pirates			1
on april 12 , the @entity2 acted			1
after a gun unexpectedly went off inside the lifeboat , the seal snipers opened fire			1
seconds later , a seal , possibly two of them , descended the tow rope and onto the lifeboat			2
he quickly shot the pirates -- one of whom was still alive			1
former seal @entity105 recounted the episode in his memoir ' no @entity108			0
' @entity109 was deployed aboard the adjacent @entity110 , an amphibious assault ship , when the rescue took place			1
' entering the life raft , they quickly and methodically re-engaged each pirate , making sure there was no more threat , ' @entity109 recalls			0
' they found @entity17 tied up in the corner unhurt			0
' open water : in a still frame from april 2009 , video released by the @entity81 taken by the @entity125 unmanned aerial vehicle , a 28 - foot lifeboat from the @entity5 - flagged container ship @entity25 is seen in the @entity37 hijacker : abduhl @entity129 was the sole survivor of a group of four pirates who attacked the @entity25 and held the captain for ransom at gunpoint			1
on 16 february 2011 , he was sentenced to over 33 years in federal prison in an interview , @entity17 said he did n't know if the @entity2 fired inside the lifeboat			1
but after it appeared the shooting had stopped , he said , one of the pirates closest to him was ' gasping ' and in a ' death rattle			2
' the young pirate had two serious chest wounds , he said			0
he did n't see the other two pirates at the other end of the lifeboat			2
attorney @entity149 , who represented the surviving pirate later prosecuted in federal court , said his legal team had an expert examine photographs the government provided of the dead @entity47			0
the expert estimated about 19 rounds had been fired into the bodies , @entity149 said			0
' there were clearly not three shots fired , ' @entity149 said			0
' they were riddled with bullets			0
' under the @entity162 , an enemy combatant who has been injured so severely that he no longer can fight is supposed to be protected and medically treated even as he is taken into custody			0
@entity165 , a professor at @entity166 and an expert on wartime legal doctrine , said he believes the @entity2 did nothing wrong			1
he said the @entity2 had to make the assumption that the @entity47 were armed and a continuing threat			1
in other words , they were still combatants			0
' i think it is pretty clear under the military 's rules of engagement that if the seal believed he still faced a threat against him he was authorized to use lethal force , ' he said			2
' i think it was an appropriate use of force under these circumstances			0
' ¿ captain @entity182 @entity35 as a high - @entity184 the $ 30,000 was never recovered			1
as part of the investigation by the @entity187 , @entity2 were polygraphed , according to former and current law enforcement and military officials who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to talk about the case			1
it 's not clear if all the @entity2 who responded to the hijacking were polygraphed			1
nobody was exempt from questioning			0
investigators interviewed capt. @entity199 , who was the executive officer of the @entity200 and among of the highest - ranking @entity81 personnel to enter the lifeboat after @entity17 had been saved , a former @entity5 official said			0
@entity204 declined to discuss @entity10 tactics or specifics of the case but said : ' the case was ultimately closed without evidence of wrongdoing			0
' @entity149 said his client , who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nearly 34 years , had no idea who took the money , and he did n't think the pirates threw it overboard			2
@entity149 said there were plenty of people who had access to the lifeboat after the shooting stopped			0
he said the crime scene was ' contaminated			0
' according to @entity17 ' account of the kidnapping , the money could have easily been concealed in a small bag or someone 's pockets			2
in his book , @entity17 writes that while he was held hostage on the lifeboat , a pirate took the money out of the bag and began dividing up into piles			0
there were ' two stacks of hundreds , one of fifties , then twenties , fives , and tens ... i never saw the money again			0
later , when they gave me a sack to lean against , i felt the stacks of money inside , but i never spotted the cash out in the open again			2
' reconstruction : @entity35 in a scene from the film , ' @entity251 , ' to the @entity47 , the ship apparently looked like a floating jackpot @entity253 , a spokesman for @entity254 , said the missing money remains a mystery : ' we simply do n't know			1
' in the new film ' @entity251 , ' viewers should n't look to the movie for the complete story			0
it does n't depict the aftermath inside the lifeboat or the criminal investigation that followed			2
director @entity266 said the movie was n't intended to tackle every twist and turn but hews to the truth			0
@entity266 said he was aware of the shooting that took place inside the lifeboat and grappled with how much bloodshed to depict			0
in the end , he made narrative judgments			0
the final violence was n't necessary			0
the result was the same : @entity17 was saved and the pirates were killed			1
what happened to the money did n't concern him			0
' movies are not journalism , ' @entity266 said			0
' movies are not history			0
