multi-millionaire @entity0 has been ordered to pay more than £ 800,000 to build two - storey basement a hedge fund manager has been ordered to pay a fee of more than £ 800,000 to create a huge two - storey underground basement below his mansion			1
the unprecedented levy on a basement excavation has shocked property experts and appears to mark the beginning of a council fightback against the creation of ‘ iceberg homes ’ in exclusive areas			1
multi-millionaire @entity0 , 48 , and his wife @entity14 , 42 , plan to build a vast subterranean extension underneath two adjoining @entity17 townhouses at an estimated cost of £ 4million			1
housing a swimming pool , spa and ‘ treatment ‘ area ’ it is likely to add £ 10million to the value of the property			1
at about 900 square metres , the basement would be the equivalent to eight average - sized new - build family homes			1
but due to the sheer scale of the extension , @entity17 and @entity29 asked for a one - off fee of £ 825,000 when it granted planning permission earlier this month			1
according to planning documents seen by the @entity37 , the fee will go towards affordable housing elsewhere in the borough			1
such payments – known as ‘ @entity42 agreements ’ – are normally confined to large - scale commercial developments of housing estates			1
it is highly unusual for them to be applied to single private planning applications			0
their extension to domestic homes could be seen as a new tax on wealthy homeowners , who already pay 7 per cent stamp duty on property purchases over £ 2million , and could enrage well - heeled residents looking to expand their properties in exclusive parts of @entity58			1
@entity17 and @entity29 ordered the section 106 payment to grant permission for the build that will add up to £ 10million to @entity0 's mansion ( pictured ) the project has been applied for in the name of mrs @entity65 , who owns one of the properties			1
her husband , founder of @entity70 , once one of @entity58 ’s most high - profile funds , owns the neighbouring house through a company			2
the two properties have 13 bedrooms between them			0
the proposed development will see the build of a ‘ double level basement extension under both buildings and extending under the small front and rear gardens whilst respecting the tree protection areas ’ , according to planning documents			2
architects ’ drawings show how the vast house will include a plunge pool , spa pool , a cinema room , games room , bar and even a wine store			2
both of the houses are listed as ‘ buildings of local interest ’ in an area that has ‘ become highly desirable as a residential location ’			0
the proposal reads : ‘ our clients wish to create two dwellings suitable for contemporary living , and to enhance the appearance of the buildings by reinstating lost architectural detailing and adding an appropriately designed first floor extension ’			0
@entity109 , head of planning at the @entity111 , the global property agents , said the move by the council to ask for a fee to build the extension was unusual			0
plan that shows how the vast extension would look when it is completed he said : ‘ this is completely off the scale			0
you do n’t normally get these agreements with residential applications			0
’ @entity125 , legal director for law firm @entity126 , said the sum appeared to be ‘ unprecedented ’ for a domestic renovation			0
the planning application reflects the trend for @entity58 ’s most wealthy homeowners to extend downwards after being faced with the high cost of moving house and the perception among many overseas buyers that @entity58 houses lack sufficient space			0
planning requests for ‘ dig - downs ’ have soared in @entity17 and @entity29 in the last decade , rising from 13 in 2001 to 307 in 2012			2
some boroughs are now starting to fight back against giant basements amid fears about the noise and disruption caused			0
@entity145 , founder of @entity58 , a residential designer and developer , said owners were unlikely to be put off by the council ’s levy			0
he said : ‘ if they are building around 1,000 square metres that could be worth some £ 10million , so even if it cost £ 4million to do and the fee is £ 800,000 the owner could still double their money			2
