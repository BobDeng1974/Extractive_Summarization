it was great to win last time out in @entity1 at the home of @entity3			1
somebody hung a @entity6 logo on the bull in the centre of the track - the @entity10 - which was cool and a bit of fun after the weekend			1
they have been , and still are , our no 1 rivals			2
@entity16 were our nearest challengers in @entity1 , but i expect it to change to - and - from throughout the season , and i think @entity3 will be faster here at the @entity22 @entity21			1
but we will still be the quickest , although the gap is getting closer			2
hands up for the winner : @entity25 celebrates his victory in the @entity1 @entity21 and ( above ) a @entity6 badge is hung around a statue of a bull in the middle of the race track prize guy : @entity25 raises the trophy at the @entity10 in @entity1 during qualifying for the race in @entity1 , we were definitely surprised , and caught off - guard as to how quick @entity16 , who secured a front - row lockout through @entity37 and @entity38 , were			1
they were really fast and that made the race a little bit more difficult ; starting third on the grid as opposed to the front row which felt a bit weird			1
in @entity1 we were not as quick as we have been			1
@entity38 and @entity37 were both very competitive and their pace was similar to ours which was surprising			2
but the race went well			1
we had a really good strategy , and that is what won us the grand prix because we pitted earlier than both of the @entity16 drivers and got the undercut			2
we had to manage our brakes throughout the race , which although it was planned and we knew it was coming , was n't easy			1
@entity61 spray party : @entity25 pops open the bubbly after his success i had @entity64 behind me , and it is always such a close battle between the both of us at every race			1
but i managed to stay in front and i could control the gap			2
there was never any risk or any chance that he would overtake me			2
there have certainly been other races where it has been more difficult to keep him behind			0
our target in @entity1 was to extend the gap in the title race ahead of this weekend 's race , i am 29 points clear , so i am happy with that			1
the momentum is definitely on my side at the moment and i need to make the most of it because it comes and goes so i have to try and keep it for as long as i can			0
@entity93 the @entity22 @entity21 is always one of the best weekends on the calendar			1
i won it last year so i have good memories of that victory			1
as a race , it is very important because both our car and engine factories are nearby , so this is effectively a home race for us			2
i just want to do a great job for everyone who works at , and is connected to @entity6 , because that is such a nice gift to give back			0
all their friends , families and kids are talking about it , which is a great thing so i am going to go out there to try and make that happen			0
the atmosphere and the support from the fans is also fantastic to see			0
on thursday , there were already plenty of people out en force even though the action on track does n't start until 24 hours later			0
the circuit itself is so quick and one that i love competing on			0
here comes the @entity129 @entity129 will be the first female racer to compete at a race weekend in 22 years when she takes part in practice on friday , which i think is great			1
she has done a good job , and i will be really , really interested to see how she gets on			0
i will definitely be looking at her lap times			0
flying the flag : @entity129 will become the first female to compete in 22 years there is no reason why a woman ca n't make it back on to the racing grid one day			1
it is more difficult because there are less trying to make it - there are a lot more guys - but there is no reason a woman could n't make it , so maybe we will see it one day			0
she has to do an all - round good job and be quick of course ! she also has to show a good understanding of the car which she has and will do			0
it is very exciting and the best advice i have for her is to enjoy it			0
girl power : @entity129 will take part in practice on friday we 're going to @entity170 it was my 29th birthday earlier this week so i celebrated it with my best friends in @entity170			1
it is very seldom that we all get together so it was a really good experience			0
we all went out partying , but it was quite relaxed and i did n't have a big party			0
my friends took it to the next level , but i stayed pretty chilled out			0
we still have 11 races to go - a long season ahead of us - so i need to keep all of my energy			0
@entity170 rocks : @entity25 celebrated his 29th birthday on the @entity186 island @entity187 must improve over in @entity188 , @entity187 had a tough match against @entity190 in their round of 16 clash			1
they progressed after extra-time , but they are not playing at their best level so they need to find something extra if they want to win this tournament			2
they need to rotate some players and bring a different game altogether to their quarter - final tie against @entity206 later on friday			0
i will be watching it in the @entity6 motorhome after practice because i am watching every game and loving it			0
on course : @entity187 survived a scare before seeing off @entity190 to reach the last eight			1

@entity25 extended his lead to 29 points with win at @entity1 @entity21
@entity187 looking to *repeat* 2013 victory at @entity221 this weekend
@entity129 to become first female involved in race weekend for 22 years
