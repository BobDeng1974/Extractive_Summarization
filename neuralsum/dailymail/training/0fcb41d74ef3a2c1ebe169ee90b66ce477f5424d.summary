by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 12 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:22 est , 12 february 2014 thirteen people have been killed at one of @entity6 's last pornographic cinemas after three grenades were thrown into the audience			0
about 80 people were in the cinema as it reportedly screened an x-rated film midway through the afternoon when one grenade hit the main door and two more landed inside the building			2
twenty more people were wounded as blood ran down the aisles of the auditorium			1
one man was decapitated in his seat by the blast			2
blood - soaked shoes , caps , condoms and human flesh were found following the attack , which a witness said happened while a pornographic film was being screened at around 4pm			2
scroll down for @entity31 attack : volunteers inside the @entity35 cinema in @entity36 , @entity6 , which is the town 's last to show pornographic films , after three grenades were hurled into the audience yesterday double life : the cinema advertised family - friendly films but had a well - known pornographic back room violence : the attack happened yesterday in the middle of the afternoon in downtown @entity36 rescue : at least a dozen people died and 20 were wounded			1
one man was decapitated in his seat by the blast dead : a blood - stained shoe lies abandoned inside the movie theatre , which showed three x-rated films a day			1
peace talks between @entity6 's authorities and the @entity58 are due to begin within days the @entity35 cinema was the last place to watch pornographic films publicly in the northwestern city of @entity36 , a battleground for @entity58 extremists			1
the cinema is famous for being one of the last places in @entity6 to defy the strict moral codes demanded by the @entity58 , upon pain of threats or death			0
attack : the cinema 's location though it has a main auditorium for mainstream films , the official public face of the cinema , it is notorious for its smaller , 30 - year - old screen showing x-rated films three times a day			1
men are known to cover their faces as they slip into the back of the theatre in a cloud of cannabis smoke , reportedly paying a special ' @entity90 ' price of 200 rupees ( £ 1.15 ) to sneak down a concrete passage past an armed guard			1
in the centre of a city of two and a half million people , the cinema had already been threatened and its owners had been told to put up metal detectors but did not follow the advice , @entity93 reported			0
various reports put the death toll between 10 and 13			0
no one has claimed responsibility for yesterday 's attack , which came days after @entity6 began a peace process with the @entity58 to end years of violence which has killed more than 40,000 people			0
one recent film at the @entity35 's backroom , @entity109 ( ' friendship ' ) , was a cheaply - made romantic drama made in @entity6 about a hero who can not decide to marry his sweetheart or his arranged bride			1
so he ' tests ' his brides - to - be to see which is the best , with much of the feature - length film occupied with graphic sex scenes			0
horror : a body is removed from the @entity35 cinema , with a pair of bloodied sandals visible on top of the bag cinema : blood - soaked shoes , caps , condoms and human flesh were reportedly found at the scene aftermath : inside the cinema journalists and police inspect the damage as blood stains the auditorium floor deaths : the attack was the second on a cinema in @entity36 in less than two weeks rescuers carry one of the bodies out of the cinema after an attacker threw three grenades into the audience carnage : people were found dead and bloodied still in their seats in the cinema in northwest @entity6 abandoned : a shoe without an owner lies between dust - strewn seats			1
most photos are too graphic to publish much of the pornography shown at the cinema is in @entity161 , the regional language , as was the film reportedly being shown at the time of yesterday 's attack			2
the attack came just nine days after another on the city 's @entity169 cinema , which killed four people and wounded 31 more , and less than two years after the @entity172 was burned down and reopened			1
islamist extremists see cinemas as an example of sinful indulgence or bowing to @entity178 ideas of entertainment			0
the fear of being seen in public at the cinema along with the rise of dvds and downloads means there are almost no cinemas left in @entity36 , once a film capital known half - jokingly as @entity189			1
fewer than 10 remain , and even they are being destroyed by extremists or knocked down and turned into shopping centres			0
one conservative political party , @entity193 ( @entity194 ) , has previously demanded the cinema should be shut down - but its owners , the @entity198 family , are influential in the rival @entity201 nationalist @entity200 party			2
some observers point to that as one explanation why the cinema may have defied strict government censorship for so long			0
house of vice : the cinema had reopened after being burned down less than two years ago			0

one man was decapitated in his seat and blood ran down the aisles
it was the last in conservative city of @entity36 to show x-rated movies
