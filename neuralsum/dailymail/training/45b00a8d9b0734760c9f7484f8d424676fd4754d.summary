by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 20:37 est , 14 november 2013 a @entity2 soldier who moved to the @entity3 after serving in the @entity4 for nine years faces deportation on sunday because of a simple administrative blunder			2
private @entity7 , who served in @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity10 and @entity11 , left the 2nd battalion the @entity12 in 2010			1
mistakenly believing @entity14 troops automatically qualified to remain in @entity15 after more than four years in the military , he failed to apply to the @entity17 for residency within 28 days of leaving the @entity4 and missed the paperwork ’s deadline			1
years of service : @entity22 , left , is pictured on patrol in the @entity10 now @entity24 , 34 , has spent a month detained by the @entity25 in an immigration removal centre at @entity27 , near @entity28 , awaiting deportation on sunday			1
others held at the centre include murderers , rapists and drug dealers			2
last night he said he felt ‘ betrayed ’ by @entity15			0
he said : ‘ it is confusing , sad and depressing			0
‘ i never dreamt that this is the place that i would end up ... i have been let down			0
’ in a plea to prime minister @entity39 , he said : ‘ please take account of my military service and what i have done for @entity15			1
release me from here and i will continue my life as usual			0
’ @entity24 ’s case has left the government accused once again of ‘ abandoning ’ the military , following round after round of spending cuts			1
it comes after the furore over @entity2 - born lance corporal @entity53 , a veteran of @entity54 and @entity11 , who was threatened with deportation because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010			2
following an outcry , he was granted an 11th hour reprieve			0
campaigners for @entity24 will contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay in @entity15 despite awful crimes , such as @entity66 , who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car			1
his case also appears at odds with mr @entity39 ’s pledge to uphold the @entity72 , society ’s duty of care to servicemen			2
@entity76 : @entity24 has begged the prime minister to intervene and let him stay in the country because of his military service @entity80 , whose uncles served in the @entity4 , including one who fought with the @entity83 in the @entity10 , signed up with 2 yorks in 2001 after seeing photographs of ceremonial parades at @entity87			1
he served in @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity10 and deployed on two tours of fierce fighting in @entity11			1
he said : ‘ that was the first time for me to see people getting wounded and killed			0
’ he left the forces in january 2010 but several months later received documents from the @entity4 informing him he should have applied for residency within 28 days			0
the soldier claimed he was not told of this requirement while in the @entity4			0
he hired a solicitor to issue a belated application to remain in @entity15 but he was informed in september he had been rejected			0
on october 12 he went to a @entity17 centre in @entity100 , @entity101 , hoping to resolve the situation but he was detained without being allowed to return to his flat to collect his belongings			2
now @entity105 , a solicitor with law firm @entity106 , is planning to launch a judicial review action against his detention , which would include an application to block @entity24 ’s imminent deportation			2
@entity112 , the father of trooper @entity113 , killed in @entity11 while @entity24 was on the frontline , said he was ‘ dismayed ’ by the situation			1
he said : ‘ he should be put up in a hotel and a civil servant should straighten this out			0
’ a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ mr @entity7 applied to stay in the @entity3 outside of the period			1
however , due to his service with the @entity4 his case is now under review			0

private @entity7 signed up to the army in 2001
he served in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11
but he failed to submit papers to the @entity17 when he left the army
@entity24 is now being held in a detention centre close to @entity28
he will be deported on sunday , but has issued a plea to @entity39
