by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 09:38 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 03:14 est , 19 september 2012 new justice secretary @entity2 today struck a tougher tone on criminal policy @entity2 yesterday ripped up @entity6 ’s hugely controversial policy of seeking to reduce the prison population			1
in his first appearance before mps as justice secretary , mr @entity2 took a far harder line on law and order than his predecessor			1
he told the @entity15 : ‘ the only changes i want to see to the prison population will come through returning more foreign national prisoners to their countries of origin			2
’ mr @entity6 , who was shifted to the post of minister without portfolio in this month ’s cabinet reshuffle , had angered backbench mps by shifting away from the party ’s traditional view that ‘ prison works ’			1
he claimed that ‘ just banging up more and more people for longer without actively seeking to change them is what you would expect of @entity31 ’			0
but mr @entity2 yesterday said his strategy for making room in packed jails would be to try to deport more foreign convicts to serve their sentences overseas			1
our jails contain inmates from 156 countries – more than three out of every four nations in the world			0
the total number of foreign prisoners has risen despite pledges by @entity46 to fix the problem			1
by march this year , there were 11,127 behind bars , at an estimated cost to the @entity52 public purse of more than £ 420million			0
mr @entity2 and his ministers said they wanted to make it a priority to pursue more prisoner transfer agreements so they can be sent home			1
he also pledged to do ‘ a much better job on the rehabilitation of offenders , so far fewer people come back to prison ’			0
@entity6 had promised to cut prison numbers when he was justice secretary his comments were applauded by @entity66 mps who had been highly critical of mr @entity6 for pursuing ‘ soft justice ’ policies			2
initially , mr @entity6 wanted to slash the prison population by 6,000			2
he abandoned a @entity66 election promise to make jail sentences mandatory for youths carrying a knife and proposed huge discounts for rapists and other convicts who admitted guilt at the first possibility			0
even after the sentencing discount plan was ditched , following the intervention of @entity81 , he was still committed to cutting the number behind bars by 2,000			0
the prison population has been falling recently – down to 86,000 , compared with the all - time high of 88,179 in december last year			0
mr @entity6 also shied away from the full - blooded confrontation with the @entity87 in @entity88 which many @entity66 supporters wanted to see after the row over whether prisoners should be allowed to vote			1
the @entity92 is struggling to balance its books after mr @entity6 agreed to slash £ 2billion for the department ’s £ 9billion budget			2
@entity96 criticised mr @entity2 for shifting away from his predecessor ’s policy on prisons and complained about the loss of mr @entity6 from the post			1
mp @entity102 said : ‘ we ’ve lost one of the few civilised , vintage politicians , who demonstrated that he had a working brain , and that he understood the benefits of remedial work in prison			0
have n’t we sadly exchanged old lace for arsenic ? ’ mr @entity2 replied : ‘ he can go on thinking what he likes , but as i ’ve made absolutely clear , i also see it as a priority to ensure that we make sure we tackle the rehabilitation challenge and that we stop people going back to prison again and again			0
