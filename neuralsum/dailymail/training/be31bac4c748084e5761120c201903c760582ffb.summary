controversy : @entity2 star @entity1 has said that he would n't necessarily support someone because of the color of their skin and criticized @entity7 and @entity8 @entity2 star @entity1 has been heavily criticized after saying that he did n't think he should necessarily have an opinion on @entity11 's shooting just because he is @entity12			1

asked about that , @entity1 said he took exception to any idea that @entity30 - @entity29 should hold opinions based on their race alone			2
' i wo n’t react to something just because i ’m supposed to , because i ’m an @entity12 , ' @entity1 said			1
' that argument does n't make no sense to me			0
so we want to advance as a society and a culture , but , say , if something happens to an @entity12 we immediately come to his defense ? ' yet you want to talk about how far we ’ve progressed as a society ? well , we ’ve progressed as a society , then do n’t jump to somebody ’s defense just because they ’re african - american			2
' you sit and you listen to the facts just like you would in any other situation , right ? so i wo n’t assert myself			0
' tribute : @entity7 and his @entity8 colleagues posed in hoodies in the aftermath of @entity11 's death at the hands of @entity25			1
@entity1 has criticized this stance in april 's edition of the @entity59 magazine the comments have provoked a huge backlash and debate and led to accusations that @entity1 is out of touch with real @entity12 - @entity12 issues			1

civil rights activist @entity72 , director of @entity73 , called for a boycott of all things @entity1			2
' @entity12 youth should no longer buy @entity1 ’s jerseys or shoes and should boycott all products he endorses , ' @entity72 said in a statement according to @entity81			1
' @entity1 does n’t identify with the struggle that our @entity12 youth face nationally			1
so why should we continue to support @entity1 who has never truly identified with the @entity12 experience			1

' it was our backyard , and being in our backyard , being something that a lot of guys on this team — not only growing up in the kind of environment that @entity11 was in — but also having young boys , ' @entity93 told @entity112			0
' knowing that he is a big fan of the @entity8			0
that is something that we got behind			0
i ca n't even say the organization			0
' it was as a team			0
and it was more so that than the color of his skin			0
' support : some did not take umbrage with @entity1 's comments and offered qualified support for them response : in the aftermath of his comments to the @entity59 magazine being reported , @entity1 clarified his position on the matter in this @entity137 however , hours later , @entity1 tweeted support for @entity11 , saying ' @entity139 was wronged thats my opinion and thats what i believe the facts showed			1
the system did not work # myopinion # @entity145			0
' but @entity137 was split on coming to the defense of the 16 - time @entity148 all - star and challenging his support of issues in the @entity12 community			1
@entity153 running back @entity154 told the @entity59 that @entity1 does n’t understand african - american culture			2
' @entity1 is somewhat confused about culture , because he was brought up in another country , ' said @entity154			0
a piece at @entity159 declared , ' over the span of @entity1 ‘ s career …			0
we ’ve seen him do and say some very smug , cavalier and even cornball things at times but the comments that he made regarding the @entity8 ’s support after @entity11 was killed … by far takes the cake ! '			1

basketball star @entity1 has been *attacked* for claiming that he should n't be expected to support @entity11 simply because he is also @entity12
singled out @entity7 and his @entity8 colleagues for wearing hoodies - like @entity11 - in the weeks after his 2012 death
