if you 're tempted to join the @entity3 movement but not quite brave enough to bare it all , a new bikini brand provides a happy compromise			1
designed by @entity8 - based feminists @entity9 and @entity10 , the @entity6 is a skin colored bikini adorned with nipples , giving the very convincing illusion of toplessness			1
the cheeky swimwear , which comes in its original nude hue as well as medium and dark skin tones , costs $ 28 per top , with $ 5 of each sale put towards a breast cancer research foundation			2
' the only excitement that comes from seeing breasts is that you are conditioned to think they are something special , something to be protected and kept hidden , ' reads the website			0
' in reality they are excess breast tissue growing into varying sized balls that you have to buy expensive support for and that throw you off balance when you run			0
' @entity10 added in an interview with @entity52 that by making the wearer look like she is baring her nipples , the @entity6 exposes people to the idea of toplessness , thereby lessening the shock factor			1
good cause : the swimwear , which comes in its original nude hue as well as medium and darker skin tones , costs $ 28 each , with $ 5 of each sale put towards a breast cancer research foundation get over it : @entity9 and @entity10 write on their website that they launched the bikini top with the aim of desexualizing the nipple exposure : ' if people look around and see this everywhere , then who cares if you can legitimately be topless ? because you 're already seeing it , ' said @entity10 ' i think that the important thing about this product is that , if people look around and see this everywhere , then who cares if you can legitimately be topless ? because you 're already seeing it , ' she said			0
though they are not directly affiliated , the @entity6 was in part inspired by the @entity3 movement launched by filmmaker @entity91 and made popular by @entity93 ' daughter @entity92			1
in may , @entity92 paraded through @entity94 - where female toplessness is legal - in just a skirt , posting pictures of herself to @entity100 with the hashtag # @entity101			0
campaign : though they are not directly affiliated , the @entity6 was in part inspired by the @entity3 movement launched by filmmaker @entity91 and made popular by @entity93 ' daughter scout debunk ideas : ' the only excitement that comes from seeing breasts is that you are conditioned to think they are something special , something to be kept hidden , ' reads @entity6 website she later explained the logic behind her topless posts in an article on @entity117 , writing : ' women are regularly kicked off @entity119 for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed , while photos sans nipple - degrading as they might be - remain unchallenged			1
' so i walked around @entity94 topless and documented it on @entity100 , pointing out that what is legal by @entity130 state law is not allowed on @entity119			0
' she added : ' what i am arguing for is a woman 's right to choose how she represents her body - and to make that choice based on personal desire and not a fear of how people will react to her or how society will judge her			0
no woman should be made to feel ashamed of her body			2
