those opposed to the @entity13 government ’s plan to force telcos to record all @entity1 ' calls , texts , and emails so that it can be freely accessed by police and intelligence agencies have begun trolling @entity22 ’s @entity21 device and copying him into all of their emails			1

@entity33 leader @entity53 claimed the attorney 's ' deplorable ' treatment of the commission and its president made him unfit to hold office as the nation 's most senior law officer			1
senator @entity22 vigorously defended his position , claiming the public deserved to know why the government had lost confidence in @entity64			1
delaying an inquiry into asylum - seeker children in detention until after @entity50 lost office could only be seen as protecting that side of politics , he said			2

the @entity143 ( @entity144 ) @entity142 bill will be debated in the @entity145 on tuesday			0
the government wants to be free to set the definition without consulting @entity148 after the bill becomes law			2
another @entity86 user promised to entertain mr @entity22 with the @entity152 in @entity43 form those opposed to the government 's data retention plan began the social media hashtag @entity157 in its review of the draft bill , @entity148 's @entity159 recommended that the definition be set in the legislation rather than decided by government through regulations			1
in describing metadata , the government uses the analogy of traditional mail			2
the metadata is the information written on the envelope , not what 's written on the letter inside			0
with telephones , metadata includes the number called , the duration , time and date of the call , plus the location of the cellphone			0
it does not include the contents of the conversation			0
but the @entity185 is a grayer area			0
@entity187 , a @entity188 law professor , said the recommendations addressed his two major concerns with the legislation : that it failed to specify what metadata was and failed to say who could access it			0
attorney - general @entity22 said the government would make a public response next week			1
it could ignore the recommendations , but to do so would likely doom the legislation to rejection in the @entity33 , where the ruling conservative coalition does not hold a majority			2

‘ @entity240 estimated the upfront capital cost of the regime to all of business to be between $ 188.8 million and $ 319.1 million , which is less than 1 per cent of the $ 43 billion in revenue generated by the telecommunications industry annually , ’ the website states			1
