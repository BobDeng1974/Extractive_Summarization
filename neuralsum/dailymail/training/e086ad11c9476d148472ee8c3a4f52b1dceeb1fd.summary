by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:38 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 : 19:16 est , 18 february 2014 a mother 's frustration is ‘ growing by the day ’ as she and her family wait for their insurers to accept liability for the damage done to their home in the @entity13			1
the @entity15 family were forced to abandon their @entity17 cottage where they lived for 17 years when defences protecting their village failed at the height of the floods			1
now @entity24 and husband @entity25 , both 44 , are battling a ‘ long - winded claim process ’ that means they wo n’t receive an insurance pay - out for months			1
long - winded : @entity24 and @entity15 and their family say they wo n't see a penny until insurers assess their flooded cottage in @entity36 ‘ we ’ve been told we wo n’t see any money until the insurers can access our house and look at the damage , ’ said the teaching assistant			1
‘ but we know that will take about six weeks			0
until then we wo n’t know what we ’re going to get , let alone actually see a penny			1
‘ it ’s frustrating because it ’s obvious to a blind man what has happened to our property			0
‘ everything feels like it is moving in slow motion			0
’ when the flood waters poured into @entity56 ’s home , she thought she could rest easy in the knowledge she had paid her insurance premium for years			1
but her insurers have now told her the £ 450 - a - year package was invalid – because she lives 200 yards from a river			0
@entity62 was the first time the 59 - year - old ’s home in @entity64 , @entity65 , had flooded in the 28 years she has lived there			1
flood water continues to surround properties in the largely evacuated village of @entity17 on the @entity13 the river @entity72 is out of sight , beyond other houses , and when mrs @entity56 last filled out an insurance form four years ago she did not disclose there was a river nearby			1
she is now living in the upper storey of her soaked home			0
to make matters worse , when the insurance firm first sent contractors to her home to start to assess and repair the damage , they dumped most of her undamaged furniture on the lawn outside			0
‘ it was left in the rain , the settee was ruined , and then people came along in vans and stole most of the other stuff , ’ said the mother of three			2
‘ then , two and a half weeks after the floods , the loss adjuster called and said i was n’t insured at all			2
i ’m still waiting to hear back from the insurance firm			0
’ @entity101 , 47 , was forced to move out after 3ft of dirty water came spilling into her home four weeks ago			2
she used to have insurance but after she made an £ 8,000 claim when her home was flooded last year she was unable to find anyone to provide cover			2
the part - time supermarket worker now faces an estimated £ 24,000 bill to repair the home in @entity17 , @entity36 , which belongs to her parents			1
@entity101 , who has moved into a nearby holiday park with daughter @entity112 , 16 , said : ‘ when it was up for renewal we just could n’t get anyone to cover because of the flooding risk			0
last year we had about £ 8,000 of work done and it was only completed in july			0
now it is ruined all over again and it is much worse this time			0
’ insurance bosses met with government ministers in @entity124 to discuss their response to the continuing flooding , which has affected many parts of southern and south - west @entity128 @entity130 ’ home in @entity131 is uninsurable after she made a claim for damage caused by flooding in june 2012			1
the full - time mother said she is ‘ worried to leave her home unattended ’ now that the building and its contents are not covered			1
mrs @entity130 said she and her husband @entity140 , both 41 , feel they have been deserted at the time when they needed help the most			0
‘ it ’s unjust that we have paid into a policy , year after year and you hope you never have to make a claim , ’ she said			2
‘ but then the worst happens , and when you ask for help , the consequences are horrendous			0
‘ the insurance companies would n’t touch us with a barge pole after making the claim			1
’ the woman who confronted @entity154 in the street in december after her 17th - century home was flooded on @entity62 has given up with her insurance firms			2
@entity158 and her husband @entity159 pay £ 2,300 a year to insure their £ 275,000 home in @entity162 , @entity163 , and the premium comes with a huge excess of £ 5,000			0
it means the couple have decided not to claim for the flood damage			0
@entity158 speaks to prime minister @entity154 ( left ) on december 27 and @entity169 minister @entity169 ( right ) yesterday ‘ the excess means if we claim , for example , £ 10,000 for the cost of replacing what we ’ve lost in the flood , our insurers will only give us £ 5,000 , ’ said mrs @entity158 , 49 , who met treasury minister @entity169 in @entity162 yesterday			1
‘ it does n’t seem worth it , given our premium and excess will probably go up so much it will become unaffordable if we claim			2
