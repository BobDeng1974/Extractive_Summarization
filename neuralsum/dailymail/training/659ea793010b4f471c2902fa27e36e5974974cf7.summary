in an all - conquering @entity1 team full of @entity3 midfielders and @entity5 forwards , being given the nickname ‘ snowplough ’ by @entity8 could easily have been taken the wrong way , but @entity10 is happy to accept it as a compliment			1
he ’s been clearing all before him and creating the space so that others can play their football since his first - team debut under @entity17 in 2008			1
tuesday night ’s @entity19 game at the @entity20 is a reminder of how @entity10 played so well in his first season that @entity1 decided they did n’t need @entity23 and let him go to @entity24 for £ 24million			1
@entity10 says that he 's happy to clear space for his @entity1 team - mates @entity26 and @entity28 @entity10 tackles @entity30 's @entity29 during the @entity32 game on saturday at the @entity33 @entity34 is all smiles in an interview ahead of the clash with @entity24 in the @entity19 at just 26 , @entity10 has already won 18 trophies : one @entity39 , one @entity40 , two @entity41 , four league titles and 10 other club cups			1
it also brings @entity34 face to face with @entity46 team - mate @entity45 , whom he does n’t hesitate to identify as @entity24 ’s greatest threat			1
‘ when they have to create danger they create a lot of danger , especially when the ball reaches @entity45 , ’ he says			2
‘ he has that freedom of movement within the side and he uses it very well			2
he can really cause you problems and he has that final pass too			2
’ the two will be at close quarters on tuesday night , with @entity45 trying to dominate the space in front of the @entity1 defence that @entity10 has patrolled so well these last seven years			1
‘ you are right in the middle of things and so to a certain extent you have to control everything , ’ he says , describing an art that seems lost to @entity69 football — who was our last great defensive midfielder ? ‘ you are there for the centre backs but also for the forwards because it ’s your responsibility to bring the ball out			2
and defensively , positioning is everything			2
more than stopping the counter-attack when it happens you want to prevent it from starting			2
it ’s more about being tactically astute than physically dominant			2
you need to know exactly where to be on the pitch at all times			2
’ when @entity10 first took over from @entity23 in the centre of @entity1 ’s three - man midfield he looked ponderous in possession but critics soon noticed he never lost the ball			1
‘ it can appear that i have waited too long to play the pass , but i ’m just waiting to see if the options will change , they usually do , ’ he says			2
‘ i play the way i am as a person			2
i do n’t panic , i ’m patient			2
’ @entity10 tries to win the ball of @entity98 of @entity30 ( front ) busquets in action in 2009 alongside then team - mate @entity23 ( right ) and @entity102 ( centre ) he had to be patient as a kid because there were no early signs of excellence and he certainly was n’t fast - tracked through @entity1 ’s @entity109 academy			1
at least he never had a problem finding someone to go in goal during the kickabouts in his back yard			2
‘ we had a goalkeeper at home and we always wanted to take shots at him , ’ he says of father @entity102 , who was @entity1 ’s first - choice keeper from 1994 to 1996			1
his first hero was @entity120 and he was at the @entity33 the night the @entity121 was thrown a pig ’s head for having joined @entity124			0
‘ i was disappointed when he left the club			0
then you grow up and become a player and you look at it differently			0
everyone has to be in charge of their own destiny			0
you play where you want to play			0
’ that is also how he sees @entity23 ’s switch to @entity24 , saying : ‘ people were surprised we had sold one of the best players in his position in the world but it was n’t just about the club wanting to sell			1
’ he does n’t see @entity23 ’s departure as a ‘ personal victory ’ but it ’s difficult not to interpret it that way			0
guardiola rubber - stamped the sale because he believed in the 20 - year - old he first coached in the youth team			1
‘ for him to have been my first manager			0
it is impossible to better that , ’ he says			0
‘ we see football the same way			0
he is the best i ’ve had , and probably ever will have			0
’ @entity10 considers @entity45 ( right ) to be @entity24 's biggest threat to @entity1 @entity34 ( left ) celebrates @entity19 victory with team - mates ( left - right ) @entity23 , @entity8 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 after they beat @entity167 2 - 0 in @entity168 in may 2009 @entity10 began the 2008 - 09 season in the youth team playing away at @entity171 in front of 1,500 spectators but he finished it in @entity168 ’s @entity174 , beating @entity167 2 - 0 in the @entity19 final			1
was it just a case of playing the same way he had under @entity178 for the youth team ? ‘ you try to , but there is no escaping how different things are , ’ he says			1
‘ in the fourth tier of @entity185 football the pitches are small , the football is direct , and i was n’t sat in the dressing room between the best midfield players in the world , @entity8 and ( @entity191 ) @entity190			1
’ with those three at the heart of the team @entity1 kept getting better and it is the @entity195 final two years later , when they beat @entity167 3 - 1 , that he says marked their peak			1
‘ if you compare the two finals – the second was much better			0
we were more mature , stronger , and clearer about what we were trying to do			0
’ so can he make it to a third final ? that will mean getting past @entity24 over two legs for the second season running			1
saturday ’s shock 1 - 0 defeat by @entity30 , ending a run of 11 straight wins , was not the best preparation but he is not about to let one defeat crush their confidence and he believes @entity24 ’s open style could suit @entity1			1
‘ @entity30 got their goal and then defended in numbers with two banks of four and it was almost impossible to attack them			0
@entity24 will want to play and they will be more open , ’ @entity10 says			1
‘ the team have reached this stage of the season in good shape physically			1
we have the best player in the world in @entity26 , and we have ( @entity120 ) @entity220 and @entity28			0
’ @entity220 ' gives us so much ' according to @entity10 of his team - mate who joined @entity1 in the summer @entity10 believes @entity220 ’s off - the - ball running has opened up spaces for @entity26 ( left ) and @entity28 @entity34 has taken to @entity220 : ‘ he gives us so much , ’ he says			1
‘ the numbers at the moment are not the same as they were at @entity234 but the way @entity1 play is not the way @entity234 play , he is not the player receiving the final pass as often			1
’ he believes @entity220 ’s off - the - ball running has opened up spaces for @entity26 and @entity28			1
‘ and it is not just the other two forwards who have benefited , but the whole team , ’ he says			1
he also believes @entity220 ’s willingness to accept that @entity26 has to be numero uno has helped him settle			0
‘ most of us understand that our reference is @entity250			0
he is the one that makes the difference			0
he is the one who gives us something that other players ca n’t			0
and it is important for new players to know that and not let it affect them			0
’ the two players have spoken about the @entity260 and although @entity1 are hopeful he will soon sign a contract extension until 2020 @entity10 sounds tempted by the idea of playing in @entity69 at some point			1
‘ perhaps when you play the same style of football for many years you can tire of it and the football in @entity69 is very different , ’ he says			0
‘ i ca n’t say i ’ll definitely play there because i ’ve always said that i want to be here for many years but i would like to experience the @entity260 one day			0
’ there would be no shortage of coaches coveting his services if he did switch — he has always been a ‘ manager ’s player ’			0
@entity46 coach @entity277 once said that if he could come back again as any player , he ’d ‘ come back as @entity34 ’			0
that begs the question which player would he be if he could choose ? surely not the ‘ snowplough ’ who clears the way for the others to play , the guy who never gets the glory ? do n’t count on it			2
‘ it ’s not easy being @entity26 , ’ @entity10 says			1
‘ let the strikers get the praise			0
i do n’t think i would change anything			0
i think i would just be me			0

@entity10 considers being @entity1 's ' snowplough ' a compliment
he was given the nickname by @entity299 team - mate @entity8
the @entity301 has been clearing all before him since his debut in 2008
