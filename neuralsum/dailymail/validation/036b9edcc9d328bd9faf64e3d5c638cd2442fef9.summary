in his best position earlier in the season , @entity2 was being written off but for the last two months he has been terrific at centre half and sunday saw him actually playing in the position he actually thinks is his best			1
from the base of midfield , the @entity6 can pass well and drive forwards in to dangerous areas			0
he is a great prospect			0
@entity12 's versatile @entity6 @entity13 battles for the ball with @entity17 's @entity16 on sunday more than a @entity18 in the absence of @entity20 , much was asked of @entity16 but he managed to deliver			1
he is certainly terrific in the air and @entity22 will not look forwards to meeting him again in the replay next month			2
however , there is more to the @entity27 - born @entity26 international			0
his link - up play was superb all afternoon			2
@entity17 striker @entity16 tries to win the ball against @entity12 's @entity32 defender @entity31 @entity33 barely a football match takes place these days without a round of applause mid-game			1
this one came in the 20th minute as @entity17 fans marked 20 years since their team – managed by @entity41 – won the league title			2
@entity41 was here on sunday but chose , rather understandably , not to join in			0
former @entity12 player and manager @entity41 looks on from the stands during the match now it ’s our turn still on the anniversary theme , @entity12 ’s match programme noted that it was an incredible 35 years to the day since a superb goal from @entity52 won a @entity53 tie at @entity54			1
odd that @entity12 ’s own publication should claim the winner of the @entity58 ’s @entity60 award was a half - volley			2
it was nothing of the sort			0
the programme noted that it was an incredible 35 years to the day since a superb goal from @entity52 show @entity67 your medals @entity17 manager @entity69 will spend a long time trying to emulate his father @entity70 , who won @entity72 titles and @entity74 cups as a player for @entity76			1
@entity77 , however , never managed to get his hands on the @entity53			0
after this , his son remains in with a shout			0
@entity69 reacts as @entity17 earn a replay at home to @entity12 in the @entity53 on sunday			1

@entity17 earned an *impressive* draw against @entity12 at @entity86
hosts *struggled* but @entity2 continued to impress for @entity12
@entity16 was superb both in the air and on the floor throughout
@entity17 manager @entity69 still has the chance to emulate his father
