a businessman battling a deadly brain tumour believes spending up to six hours a day on his mobile phone has given him cancer			1
after going to hospital with a bad headache , @entity5 was given the devastating news he had a lemon - sized brain tumour - and has just three years to live			1
the 43 - year - old claims his cancer was caused by excessive use of his mobile phone , as his job as an operations manager for a large firm required him to spend more than 100 hours a month making calls			1
as well as undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment in a bid to beat the cancer , he is receiving alternative medicine , has changed his diet , and regularly exercises			1
@entity5 , 43 , claims spending six hours a day on a mobile phone gave him a brain tumour			1
he now uses a bright gold receiver ( pictured ) to make calls after driving himself to hospital with a blinding headache , an mri scan revealed mr @entity5 had a lemon - sized tumour next to his right ear			1
the scan is pictured ( it is mirrored , so the left side of the scan shows the right side of the brain ) he has also launched a campaign to make others aware of the risks of using mobile phones , which he says are particularly dangerous for children			2
mr @entity5 , a former rugby player , said : ' i spent my working life on my mobile			2
i would have two - hour conference calls some days			2
' my ear would be red when i left work at the end of the day			2
i did n't think what it was doing to my brain			2
' mr @entity5 , head of healthcare diagnostic imaging for a large global firm , was hit by a sudden blinding headache and drove himself to @entity56 in the middle of the night			1
he was given a brain scan on an mri machine which he had installed himself just two weeks earlier at the @entity60 , @entity61			0
the scan revealed a grade 3 brain tumour the size of a lemon and mr @entity5 underwent a nine - hour emergency operation to remove most of it			1
but he was given the horrific news that the brain cancer could not be cured and was advised to make the most of the little time he had left			2
mr @entity5 said : ' i was devastated - the first thing i asked the doctors was what had caused it			1
' but i knew right from the start that it was due to my excessive use of my mobile - i was on it all the time			2
' i have spent a lot of time since researching this and the number of brain tumours is going up			0
mr @entity5 underwent a nine hour operation to remove his tumour ( his scars are pictured , left and right , after the operation ) ' i am really concerned about young children using mobiles - their skulls are softer and radiation from these devices can reach their brains more easily			1
' mr @entity5 has now invested in a shiny gold hand receiver which he plugs into his mobile to make and receive calls , meaning he does n't have to hold the phone to his ear			1
he said : ' i bought a gold one to draw attention to the potential dangers of mobiles			0
' strangers ask me why i use a hand held receiver and i tell them they would too if they had been diagnosed with a brain tumour			1
' i tell people that i am convinced my cancer was caused by using my mobile up to six hours a day			1
' even my doctors wo n't argue with me when i tell them how much time i was spending on it at work			0
' mr @entity5 estimates he was talking for more than 100 hours a month on his @entity114 - because of his high - pressure job			1
he said : ' i was a successful rugby player , extremely fit and i never got ill - not even with a cold			0
but now i have this			0
' the irony is that the tumour was discovered on one of the diagnostic machines that i installed at hospitals all over the country			0
' mr @entity5 , of @entity61 , hopes to beat the cancer with a combination of chemotherapy , radiotherapy alternative medicine , diet and ' sheer bloody mindedness '			1
mr @entity5 has been forced to quit his £ 100,000 a year job due to his illness , and is launching a campaign to raise awareness to the risks of using mobile phones he said : ' they gave me three years to live but i will prove them wrong time and again			1
' the tumour has shrunk to nothing once but it 's back now and i 'm having chemo again			0
' but i am convinced that it will disappear again before my current course of chemotherapy is complete			0
' mr @entity5 has been forced to quit his £ 110,000 a year job because of his illness			2
the former @entity147 second row forward now spends his time with his girlfriend and his parents @entity150 and @entity152 , mainly watching rugby and visiting the gym four times a week			0
he has launched a campaign to highlight the dangers of mobile phones , convinced he can inform others of the risks			0
he has persuaded @entity163 rugby stars @entity161 and @entity164 to shave their heads for the @entity167 charity he supports			0
he said : ' i will beat my tumour but in the meantime i need to get the message across that mobile phones can be dangerous			2
' i used mine too much , i know that - but people need to be made aware of the risks and start switching to hand - held receivers			0
it could save their lives			0
' the potential connection between mobile phones and cancer is a controversial debate			2
countless studies have failed to provide a consensus about the degree of cancer risk			0
the key concern is that phones could cause brain tumours			0
the largest study to date formed part of the @entity190 , and included around 790,000 women			0
it found no link between mobile phone use and brain tumours , or 18 other types of cancer			1
studies on whether mobile phones cause brain tumours come to different conclusions another study followed more than 420,000 users over a 20 - year period			2
it found no direct link between mobile phones and brain tumours			0
and another piece of research did note a link between mobile phone use and cancer of the salivary glands , but only a small number of study participants had cancerous tumours			1
meanwhile another recent study suggested a possible increased risk of glioma - a specific type of brain tumour - for those using their mobiles a lot			1
but researchers found no increase in brain tumour risk overall			2
in 2012 the @entity231 's @entity230 found there was a ' causal link ' between phone use and a businessman 's brain tumour diagnosis			1
@entity237 , 60 , had used his mobile phone for up to six hours a day for 12 years			1
oncologist and professor of environmental mutagenesis @entity241 and neurosurgeon dr @entity243 gave evidence supporting mr @entity237 's claim			0
they argued that mobile and cordless phones emit electromagnetic radiation causing damage to cells and increasing the risk of tumours			0
but they added that many tumours do n't appear for 15 years , making short - term studies on mobile phone use redundant			1
experts at the @entity259 in the @entity260 note that after evaluating the evidence , members of the @entity263 - part of the @entity264 - agreed there is limited evidence that mobile phone radiation triggers cancer			1
but , they warn , a series of studies can not tell the full story , and only time will tell			0
oncology experts advise people who are concerned about a possible link between mobile phones and cancer to limit their phone use , or use a speaker or hands - free device as with smoking and tobacco , the experts say it may take many years for a direct link to emerge			1
consultant in medical oncology at @entity259 , @entity290 , notes : ' at this point , it 's possible that too little time has passed to detect an increase in cancer rates directly attributable to cellphone use			0
' the bottom line ? for now , no one knows if cellphones are capable of causing cancer			0
' they advise if people are concerned that they limit their phone use , or use a speaker or hands - free device			0
meanwhile professor @entity306 , professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the @entity308 added : ' overall , the balance of evidence from what is now a substantial body of epidemiological and toxicological research suggests that mobile phones do not cause brain tumours or any other sort of cancer			2
' because the technology has only been widely used for about 15 years , we can not rule out the possibility of a risk that only emerges many years after exposure , but that too is looking increasingly unlikely			0

@entity5 , 43 , had a blinding headache and drove himself to hospital
was diagnosed with a grade 3 brain tumour next to his right ear
underwent a nine hour operation to remove the lemon - sized tumour
has been told he has three years to live and is undergoing chemotherapy
claims using his mobile phone for hours every day caused his cancer
now uses a bright gold receiver so he does n't press the phone to his ear
