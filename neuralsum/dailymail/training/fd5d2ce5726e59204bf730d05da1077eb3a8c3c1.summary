a flagship government policy to improve care for the elderly at home so they do n’t end up in hospital has been branded a ‘ shambles ’ by @entity5			1
they claim it will only save the @entity9 a third of the cash intended – and even that is ‘ ambitious			1
’ the @entity13 is a series of locally - run schemes to boost services for the elderly at home to prevent them becoming seriously ill in @entity19			1
these include making nurses and physios available at weekends , providing more home - help and installing disabled - access toilets and showers			0
a flagship government policy to improve care for the elderly at home so they do n’t end up in hospital has been branded a ‘ shambles ’ by @entity31 mp @entity30 ( file picture ) the policy was first announced by the government last june but the money – £ 5.3 billion – will not be made available until next april			1
in the meantime , local organisations called @entity39 have been drawing up detailed plans setting out how they will spent their share of the pot. ministers hope that the scheme will ultimately save the @entity9 money as there will be fewer , expensive admissions to hospital			1
they calculate that in its first year of running , 2015/16 , it will save the health service £ 1billion as care at home will be so much improved			1
but mps on the @entity54 who have been scrutinising the local plans estimate it will save just £ 314million			0
and even that amount is ‘ ambitious ’ , they say , as it is based on an assumption that the numbers of elderly ending up in @entity19 will fall by 3 per cent			0
this can not be guaranteed – regardless of how care as improved at home – as a particularly cold winter or severe flu season good lead to many more admissions			2
@entity30 , chair of the @entity54 , said the planning of the @entity13 was a ' shambles ' mps also claim that @entity9 bosses did not tell the 151 boards from the start how much money they needed to try and save			1
this meant that most of their initial plans had to be torn up and started from scratch as they had n’t taken this into account			0
@entity31 mp @entity30 , chair of the @entity54 said : ‘ i am dismayed that planning for the @entity13 has been such a shambles			1
‘ the @entity13 will not now deliver the £ 1 billion savings originally expected – savings which local areas were not initially told they should collectively deliver			2
‘ now local area plans forecast £ 314 million of savings for the @entity9 , which is less than two - thirds of that originally expected			0
‘ furthermore the assumption that local areas can achieve a reduction in emergency admissions of 3.1 per cent is a triumph of hope over reality			0
she also warned that the scheme had lost ‘ credibility ’ due to the delays and the fact the plans had to be re-drawn			0
‘ such incompetence from @entity100 is unacceptable at a time when the number of people most likely to need care is rising , and overall funding is falling			0
the @entity106 has long called for improved care for older people at hospital and at home as part of our dignity for the @entity115 campaign			2
last month the government announced further details of the @entity13 and promised it would prevent 160,000 needing to be admitted to hospital a year			2
they also estimated that a further 2,000 patients would not need to go into care homes as services would be so good they could live independently .			0

the flagship policy will only save the @entity9 a third of the cash intended
