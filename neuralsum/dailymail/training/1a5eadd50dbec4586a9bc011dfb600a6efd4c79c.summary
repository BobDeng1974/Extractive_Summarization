it 's always nice , and brave on their part , for hotel staff to tell guests on arrival that they will try and deal with any requests they may have			1
an extra towel , having an ironing board sent to your room , and replacement toilet rolls are easy enough to arrange			0
but how about getting a llama to run amok in the hotel or allowing 6ft long monitor lizard in the room ? it seems there is nothing concierges at these hotels wo n't do to make a guest 's stay perfect			1
but just what are the strangest requests they have ever received ? hotel concierges are usually only too keen to fulfil their guests ' requests , but some travellers push it too far a personal invite for a llama - grand @entity33 , @entity34 a guest staying at the @entity33 @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity36 , wanted to surprise a friend with news of a trip away			1
so to give a clue , he negotiated with hotel staff to bring a llama in to help give a clue as to where he was whisking his mate off to			1
it was of course @entity48 , and they happily went off some time later			0
the llama was of course taken home safely			0
one man keen to reveal a surprise destination in a clever way to a friend asked for , and got , a llama penguins waiting in the room - @entity59 , @entity60 sitting alongside the llama for one of the wackiest requests comes courtesy of the fantasy island of @entity60			1
a concierge at the @entity67 has revealed that one guest asked for a group of penguins to be waiting for them in their room , with @entity74 narrating the meeting			1
sadly , the guest did n't get chance to p - p - p - pick up a penguin , and the request was dismissed			0
no shock that a request for penguins to be waiting in the @entity67 was dismissed room full of @entity84 , @entity85 @entity86 decided to have some fun when she checked into the @entity84 during a business trip			2
after receiving a welcome text that offered assistance ' any time , ' ms @entity86 replied back saying she would like a signed picture of @entity92 in @entity93 on her bed			1
and the well - meaning staff adhered to her request , and the actors face was waiting on entry			2
the rest of the trip involved various other requests for @entity92 in an array of films , all granted by the hotel			1
@entity86 was delighted when her jokey requests for images of @entity92 were fulfilled the dedicated staff delivered the requested images , and even apologised when one did n't come in time three m&ms and a bacon portrait - @entity112 , @entity114 @entity115 is a beautiful thing to many people , so much so a guest asked for a picture of it in his room along with three red @entity111 @entity122 and girlfriend @entity123 decided to spent the night at the @entity112 in @entity114 after purchasing tickets to see their favorite singer @entity125 perform there			1
when @entity122 had completed the online booking for the hotel room a month earlier he could n’t resist having some fun when it came to the ‘ special requests ’ section			1
@entity122 requested : ‘ three red @entity111 on the counter			0
not packages , just three single @entity111			0
one for me , one for my girlfriend , and one to split if we get hungry late at night			0
and a picture of bacon set on the bed			2
i love pictures of bacon			2
’ and sure enough , on checking into their room they were met by the @entity111 , which they shared , and the delicious photo of bacon			2
a large rubber duck in the bathroom ? - @entity150 , @entity151 it 's always nice to have some element of home comforts when your staying in a hotel			1
and one guest made sure he was n't going to miss out during his stay at the @entity150 in @entity159 , @entity160 , when he requested a large rubber duck for the bathroom			0
other requests received by staff for the brand with the @entity167 commercials include a team member loaning a guest their trousers for an important last minute meeting in @entity172 , helping a guest buy a new bridesmaid 's dress as the original had ripped on a wedding day in @entity177 on @entity178 and helping a guest propose to their bride to be because they were too nervous in @entity182			1
can i bring my 6ft - long lizard ? - @entity185 , @entity186 can you tell me how many stars are in the sky tonight ? can you call @entity191 and find out if the @entity192 is in ? can you store my lobster in your freezer ? these are just some of the peculiar requests @entity185 staff have been asked by customers			1
one such customer who was staying at @entity200 asked the hotel team if he could practice his board presentation in @entity203 to the hotel team prior to a meeting			2
a 6ft - long monitor lizard was n't included in the @entity185 's list of permitted pets another , staying at @entity209 , asked the hotel manager if he could borrow his suit for the morning as he had a job interview and he forgot his suit at home			1
meanwhile , the hotel receptionist at @entity217 received a call from a @entity219 to see if her boss could be dropped off by helicopter in the hotel car - park			2
and the best of all was a man who was unsure if the pet policy covered his far - from - domestic animal at the @entity185 - a 6ft monitor lizard			0
help to buy two camels ? - @entity228 , @entity230 a guests asked the staff at the @entity228 in @entity233 , @entity230 if they could assist him buy two camels			2
the concierge , who was on her first month in the job , kept her cool , and a straight face , located a nearby dealer , and the guest 's wish was fulfilled			0
well nearly ... after giving the camels a ' once over , ' the camel had one too few humps for the guest 's liking and he pulled out of the deal			0
he clearly should have specified he wanted a bactrian breed of camel so he did n't get a dromedary			0
although a concierge found a camel dealer in @entity230 , the guest wanted them to have two humps not one wild goat 's milk from @entity258 ... for a bath - @entity259 , @entity261 the @entity259 's head butler @entity262 has had some wacky requests in his days service elite guests , with wild goat 's milk for a guest 's bath among the more unusual			1
but it was certainly achievable , at a cost			0
the milk itself cost a manageable £ 50 , but the taxi fare to @entity258 and back to get it ran up £ 600 on the meter			0
the milk was then warmed up , and 30 bottles of heated @entity277 was used to rinse the white stuff off the picky client afterwards			0
a unicorn greeting - @entity280 in @entity282 , @entity283 for all of a hotel employee 's good intentions , mythical animals are a request too far			1
but the concierge at the @entity280 in @entity282 , @entity283 , thought outside the box , and purchased a cuddly unicorn toy instead			0
citing that the unicorn had ' migrated ' for the season , the toy was left with an apology of not being able to purchase the real thing .			0

@entity300 , goat 's milk and bacon feature in world 's wackiest hotel requests
portraits of @entity92 were granted by one helpful staff member
but mythical creatures and penguins are beyond their *capabilities*
