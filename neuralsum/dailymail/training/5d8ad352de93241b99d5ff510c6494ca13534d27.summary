by @entity0 the number of sex offenders barred from working with children has plunged by more than 75 per cent since vetting and barring legislation was changed three years ago , it has been claimed			1
some 12,360 people were said to have been stopped from working with children in 2011 due to committing sexual offences against youngsters			1
this fell to 5,758 in 2012 and 2,800 in 2013 , according to figures obtained by @entity12 using freedom of information laws			1
@entity14 : some 12,360 people were said to have been stopped from working with children in 2011 due to committing sexual offences against youngsters ( file picture ) other data released today shows the number of people being barred from working with children as a result of intelligence sharing and investigations by the police and @entity27 ( @entity27 ) has fallen from 1,542 in 2011 to 471 in 2012 and to 351 in 2013			1
@entity12 has claimed changes made by home secretary @entity29 have played a significant role in these reductions as her reforms made it harder to bar a convicted sex offender			2
@entity35 , shadow home secretary , said : ‘ @entity29 was warned repeatedly that the new legislation left major loopholes in the system			1
this evidence shows those warnings were right			0
’ meanwhile , data from the @entity42 suggests recorded sexual offences against children aged under 16 went up by 23 per cent between 2004 - 05 and 2012 - 13 , reported @entity45			1
miss @entity35 went on : ‘ parents want to know that if someone has committed serious abuse against children or has a history of grooming or sexual abuse , they will not be allowed to work with children			0
‘ and schools , sports organisations and other groups need to be able to have confidence in the vetting and barring system			0
child protection is immensely important and it must not be put at risk because of faulty legislation or failures in the @entity65 system			0
’ criticism : shadow home secretary @entity35 ( left ) claimed home secretary @entity29 ( right ) ' was warned repeatedly that the new legislation left major loopholes in the system ' barring based on conviction was changed by legislation			1
for all but a handful of offences , only those actually working with children or expressing a desire to work with children are added to the barred list , while those in other occupations are not added			2
a @entity65 spokesman said : ‘ it remains the case that anyone committing the most serious offences is still automatically barred from working closely and unsupervised with children			2
‘ the coalition government introduced changes to the barring regime to apply common sense levels , but if someone applies to work with children any serious criminal records or police information are still considered when checks are carried out and , if necessary , they will be barred			0
' child protection is immensely important and it must not be put at risk because of faulty legislation or failures in the @entity65 system ' @entity35 , shadow home secretary ‘ the changes strike an appropriate balance between avoiding unnecessary intrusion into people 's lives and ensuring that children and vulnerable groups are protected			0
’ an @entity42 spokesman said : ‘ these figures add to our concerns that the pendulum may be swinging in the favour of abusers ' rights rather than child protection			2
‘ the dramatic drop in the number of people being barred is concerning and the @entity27 needs to explain why this has happened in a transparent way to reassure that the current system is fit for purpose in terms of its contribution to protect children			0
‘ given the number of sexual offences against children has not fallen in line with the number of people being barred , it would seem timely for a review of the implementation of the service to take place to ensure that children are being adequately protected			0
