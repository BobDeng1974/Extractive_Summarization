an eye test that has improved the performance of @entity5 @entity4 stars and elite rugby players is helping transform children 's reading skills , experts claim			1
the £ 189 test – a more advanced form of a high street eye exam – has already boosted the concentration of champion skier @entity13 by recommending she wear pink - tinted goggles to reduce glare while hurtling 80mph down the slopes			1
experts also say they have improved reaction times of members of the @entity21 women 's lacrosse team			1
now parents claim that children taking the test are improving their reading speeds – and performing better at school			1
an eye test that has improved the performance of @entity5 skier @entity13 ( pictured ) is helping transform children 's reading skills those behind the test say it identifies people suffering from ' visual stress ' , which means their eyes are over-sensitive to black and white and words appear to swim on the page			1
it is thought this happens because cells in the area of the brain responsible for vision get over-excited by the pattern and work too fast , causing text to become distorted			2
studies suggest as many as one in four has this problem			0
however , most are unaware they are affected and the condition is not picked up during a routine visit to an optician			0
children with the sensitivity are said to lose concentration easily because they struggle to focus on text , and can fail to perform well at school despite being bright			1
experts at @entity62 , the company behind the test , say many can be helped by using colour - tinted glasses or a transparent sheet of coloured plastic which can be laid on top of textbooks			1
colour is thought to ' calm ' the cells so that the image becomes stabilised			0
but the colour each person needs to correct the problem is different – and scientists are unable to explain why			0
@entity75 , 14 , was lagging behind his twin sister at school but after taking the test passed his 11 - plus @entity75 , 14 , from @entity79 , was lagging behind his twin sister @entity80 at school and was regularly placed bottom of the class			1
after taking the test , he passed his 11 - plus			1
his mother @entity85 said : ' @entity75 would say text would move around and he could n't focus			0
he lost confidence and was very unhappy at school			0
when we took him to do this test , an orange colour was placed over the text and it was a eureka moment			2
' the test takes place in the company 's offices in @entity97 , @entity98 , but other opticians offering it can be found via the @entity101 prescribers			2
@entity13 , 32 , who competed as part of @entity103 in four @entity104 , did the test after suffering from snow - blindness			1
she said : ' i was skiing with a yellow - tinted lens , but the test found that my eyes had to work less hard with a pink lens			2
' you put your lens down just before you start to race , and it had been taking my eyes a few minutes to adjust			0
with the pink , it was immediate			0
' @entity117 rugby team and @entity118 have also used the test			2
members of @entity21 's women 's lacrosse team improved reaction times by up to two seconds on a test that involved hitting a number of random flashing lights			2
vision in learning founder @entity128 said : ' the transformation with the coloured filters is often incredible			0
it can be the first time a parent has heard their child read properly			0
there can be tears in the room			0

advanced eye test has boosted the concentration of skier @entity13
experts say the same test is also helping improve students ' reading skills
parents claim their children are *benefiting* from *increased* reading speeds
