@entity0 recovered from a poor start at @entity2 and the early loss of full - back @entity4 to maintain their @entity7 title title with an emphatic 47 - 17 victory against @entity0			1
@entity9 shocked the home side when he powered over in the fourth minute but @entity0 replied with tries from @entity12 and @entity13 to lead 15 - 5 at half - time			1
@entity16 's men added further tries from @entity18 , @entity13 , @entity19 and @entity20 in the second half as the @entity23 challenge faded			1

@entity0 pulled clear in the second period as @entity13 , may and @entity32 ran riot			1
next up for @entity0 is a trip to @entity35 in two weeks time			2
a huge encounter awaits at the @entity37			0
that man @entity38 has had quite the second half			2
the powerful @entity41 centre did brilliantly to muscle over in the right corner following a superb break from replacement @entity45			0
@entity23 keep possession for a sustained period in the @entity0 22 and @entity49 pokes through a deft grubber but substitute @entity51 can not gather the rebound to touch down			1
another recalled @entity0 exile crosses the line			0
@entity20 has just joined the action but the veteran @entity57 8 emerges from a powerful @entity0 maul to touch down			1
@entity19 hooks his conversion effort			0
@entity0 have 10 minutes to rack up some more tries and they look to bump up their points difference on the table ... the floodgates have opened			0
@entity19 has barely been on the field for two minutes and the @entity65 fly half has crossed the whitewash			2
@entity19 ran a great support line to latch onto @entity70 's offload as @entity0 cruise out a huge lead @entity0 are cruising now			1
a rock solid scrum on half allows @entity18 to feed @entity75 at first receiver before the @entity78 man sends a screen pass to @entity80 who puts his @entity82 team - mate @entity13 through a yawning gap in midfield for his second try of the afternoon			1
some of @entity0 's attacking play has left much to be desired today but @entity80 's place kicking has been immaculate			1
the @entity82 no 10 knocks over another three - pointer as @entity0 begin to pull away			2
that 's poor from @entity23			2
referee @entity92 awards @entity0 a penalty from a collapsed scrum and @entity18 shows quick wits to take a quick tap and crash over from close range			2
@entity98 fires over the conversion as @entity0 establish a 15 - point lead			1
that 's the first sign of fatigue from the @entity23			2
@entity0 will look to put this game to bed and rack up a score in the final quarter surely			0
that 's as good a try as you will see anywhere this season			0
@entity23 winger @entity110 chips the @entity0 defence and gathers to set up a great attacking platform			1
quick hands from @entity49 and @entity116 release @entity114 who shows @entity118 and @entity119 a clean pair of heels to scorch over from 30 metres			2
@entity116 misses the conversion but @entity23 are right back in this contest again			0
silly play from @entity23 flanker @entity124 hands @entity98 the chance to further increase @entity0 's lead early in the second half following a bullocking run by lock @entity118 in the build - up			1
@entity130 kicks the ball dead as both sides head for the sheds			0
a thrilling opening half here in @entity2			2
@entity9 's opening try shocked @entity0 into life before @entity4 's unfortunate injury			1
tries from @entity12 and @entity13 have steadied the ship for @entity16 's side but the second half promises to be a fascinating contest			1
@entity0 go to their lineout maul close to the @entity41 line but @entity145 and @entity119 are driven back by the @entity23 pack and are awarded the put - in to the resultant scrum			1
amid all the excitement generated by @entity13 's electric , long - range try , @entity0 's coaches will be especially satisfied by @entity145 's breakdown work			1
not so long ago , the management were casting doubt on their captain 's credentials at the ruck , but he earned the turn - over which paved the way for @entity13 's scorching run and finish			2
moments later , @entity119 also weighed in with a breakdown ' steal '			0
an area of previous @entity164 weakness is becoming a strength on this evidence			0
@entity119 is penalised at the breakdown but @entity116 fails to punish @entity0 as his long - range penalty effort drags to the right and wide			1
that was a marginal decision by the @entity171			0
replays seemed to suggest that after @entity12 had crashed over the line and landed on top of @entity176 , the ball had ended up touching the ground , but it was n't clear if the @entity0 no 8 was in control of it at the time			1
nonetheless , the try was awarded			0
@entity23 will feel aggrieved , but the home side are increasingly asserting themselves after a slow start			0
what a try from @entity13 ! @entity145 steals the ball on the deck and when the ball is spun out to the @entity82 centre , he does n't need a second invitation to stretch his legs			1
@entity13 shows his stunning footwork to step @entity116 before setting off on a 40 metre dash to the try line			0
awesome from the @entity82 man			0
after a stuttering start , @entity0 have cruised into a 10 - point lead			2
great power from @entity12 to power over in the left corner			0
@entity12 managed to squeeze over following a superb lineout move involving disguised passes from @entity145 and @entity118			1
@entity80 pulls the touchline conversion wide , but @entity0 finally have the lead in this game			1
@entity0 have their first points on the board after 18 minutes of play			0
@entity116 has made a great start to the game but he 'll be disappointed with his indiscipline at the ruck which allows @entity80 to bisect the posts to get his side back in the game			0
@entity116 has made a sensational start to this game			0
@entity23 's @entity218 10 is 17st but he has deft skills on the ball , as he has already demonstrated			0
the dummy and break from his own 22 showed a daring instinct , his distribution in the lead - up to @entity9 's try was shrewd and his well - weighted kick into @entity0 's 22 so nearly sent @entity227 away for a second @entity41 try			1
@entity4 has left the field on a stretcher following his collision with @entity227			2
@entity75 is on for the @entity233 man			0
@entity13 moves to the wing with @entity235 going to full back @entity4 did brilliantly to bring down @entity227 after the @entity238 centre gathered @entity116 's brilliant chip , but the @entity57 full back is getting treatment on the ground after an apparent head knock			1
it 's all one - way traffic so far at @entity2			2
@entity23 had a great attacking platform on the @entity0 22 allowing @entity116 to release @entity227 in midfield			1
@entity247 , @entity248 and @entity124 all carried in the attack before @entity116 threaded through a lovely weighted kick which @entity227 regathered			1
the @entity238 player was brought to ground by @entity4 but the onrushing @entity253 spilled his offload with the try line begging ... @entity23 are full value for their early lead here			1
the @entity23 came firing out of the blocks early on with centre @entity38 looking dangerous with ball in hand			1
@entity116 made a lovely half break with a dummy inside his 22 in just one of several @entity41 phases of possession			0
interesting start to this game			0
who saw that coming ! great build - up from @entity23 on the short side and @entity9 throws an audacious dummy and barrels over close to the line			1
great start for the visitors			0
@entity4 takes the kick - off and takes the tackle			0
@entity18 gets a poor pass away to @entity80 who does well to clear his lines			2
time for the anthems and then we 'll be underway ... ten minutes to kick - off here at @entity2 and it 's fair to say that there 's a distinct lack of noisy tension around the place			1
understandable expectation of a resounding home win , but @entity0 will need the home support early on as they attempt to soften up @entity23 's formidable pack			1
rain in the air 15 minutes before kick off at @entity2			0
@entity0 head in to changing rooms after @entity23			2
@entity2 's otherwise excellent surface will be a little slippery early on			2
both sides are out warming up on the @entity2 turf			0
the sizable figure of @entity116 will be central to @entity23 's fortunes this afternoon			0
the @entity23 have struggled to fill the no 10 jersey since @entity305 retired in the early noughties			0
@entity307 has turned to @entity309 - born powerhouse @entity116 for this year 's championship			0
the last time @entity23 came to @entity2 , @entity0 got into a right tussle			1
six @entity313 penalties secured an 18 - 11 victory against the @entity23 two years ago as @entity316 's side survived an almighty scare			1
@entity0 backs coach @entity318 is hoping his side can keep the good times rolling against the @entity23 following their triumph in @entity322			1
@entity318 said : ' it is important to win your home games â€” with what we have got coming up this year			0
all week there has been a feelgood factor within the rugby nation			0
we want to put on a performance to make sure people come to the ground , enjoy themselves and have the feelgood factor next week			0
that only comes from a good performance			0
