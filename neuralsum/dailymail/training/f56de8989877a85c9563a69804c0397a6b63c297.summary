by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 05:16 est , 30 november 2012 @entity1 suggests what opponents immediately described as ' chilling ' changes to protections given to journalists who are handling ' private ' information investigative journalists who breach data protection rules could be jailed for two years under proposals in the @entity1 report			1
the judge also suggests what opponents immediately described as ‘ chilling ’ changes to protections given to journalists who are handling ‘ private ’ information			1
both @entity16 and @entity17 raised serious concerns about the proposed changes to the @entity20 , which currently gives a wide exemption to public - interest journalism			1
in the @entity23 yesterday mr @entity16 said he was ‘ instinctively concerned ’ about the plans			1
@entity26 sources went further , warning that the proposals could have a ‘ chilling effect ’ on investigative journalism operating in the public interest			2
they said the measures raised eyebrows because they were completely unexpected and had had not been discussed in detail during the inquiry			0
currently , journalists are allowed to hold personal information about criminals , corrupt politicians and rogue traders whom they are investigating without falling foul of privacy law			1
unlike the government agencies and private companies , journalists do not have to comply with strict rules about how private information must be handled			1
but @entity1 proposes removing a number of key legal protections offered to journalists under the @entity20			1
he also suggests that punishments for breaches of the @entity20 should be increased from an unlimited fine now to a jail term of up to two years			2
@entity1 proposes changing the law so that personal data can be held only if it is absolutely necessary for a specific article which is set for publication			1
it would undermine investigations which take a long time and involve gathering information which might ultimately never be used			2
personal data used by journalists can include bank account statements showing illegal payments made to crooked officials or credit card receipts proving abuse of taxpayers ’ money			2
in the @entity23 yesterday mr @entity16 , pictured , said he was ' instinctively concerned ' about the plans responding to the report in the @entity23 yesterday , mr @entity16 said it proposed ‘ some changes to the @entity20 that would reduce the special treatment that journalists are afforded when dealing with personal data ’			1
‘ we must consider this very carefully – particularly the impact this could have on investigative journalism			0
‘ while i have only been able to make preliminary investigations about this since reading the report , i am instinctively concerned about this proposal			1
’ the report proposes making it harder for journalists to gather personal information without falling foul of the law			1
journalists who are publishing personal information would no longer be able to justify it on the grounds that they have a right to freedom of expression			1
in addition , they would no longer be exempt from particular parts of the @entity20 , such as subject access requests			0
this change might allow anyone who is the subject of an investigation to demand to see what information a newspaper holds about him or her			0
@entity1 ruled that worldwide circulation of pictures showing prince @entity113 , pictured , naked did not justify their publication in @entity116 newspapers			1
just nine pages of @entity1 ’s 2,400 - page report focused on news on the internet			1
in it , he ruled that worldwide circulation of pictures showing prince @entity113 naked did not justify their publication in @entity116 newspapers			0
photographs showing the prince after a game of ‘ strip billiards ’ in @entity127 were viewed by millions on the internet after they appeared on a @entity130 gossip website and social media sites including @entity132			0
but @entity1 said that was no justification for them appearing in a @entity116 newspaper			2
parents could stop their children from accessing the pictures on the internet but would find it difficult to stop them seeing the images in newspapers , he said			0
his comments appeared to contradict repeated warnings from internet safety campaigners that children access the internet on smartphones and laptops regularly without their parents ’ knowledge			0
@entity1 said : ‘ to some extent , parents can control what their children can access on the internet : if they take their child into a newsagent , garage or supermarket – or past a news stall – the control that they must be entitled to exercise is lost			2
’ in @entity116 , the @entity163 was the only newspaper to publish the @entity113 pictures after prince @entity165 instructed lawyers to threaten legal action for infringing his son ’s ‘ privacy ’			0
the @entity163 claimed the prince had ‘ compromised his own privacy ’ and it was ‘ perverse ’ for newspapers not to publish the shots when they were freely available on the internet			0
@entity1 said there was a legitimate public interest in raising questions over @entity113 ’s conduct , and the remit of his protection officers who seemingly allowed the prince to invite strangers to his hotel room for the naked romp			2
but he said that debate did not require the publication of the photographs			0
‘ the fact that something is on the internet does not justify its publication in a newspaper			0
’ no formal complaint was made by the @entity195			0
a month later , a @entity197 magazine published photographs of @entity199 sunbathing topless and they were subsequently circulated on websites .			0
