@entity8 , 33 , weighs in at a staggering 520lbs - but says she needs to fatten up for her wedding day			1
unlike most figure - conscious brides - to - be , in preparation for her final wedding dress fitting , @entity8 feasted on an enormous breakfast of pancakes , @entity16 waffles , hash browns , sausage links , steak , and a giant 12 - egg omelette			1
the monumental challenge of making a dress to fit the bride 's @entity50 figure was given to dressmaker @entity52 , who calculated after measuring @entity8 that she would need 45ft of fabric to complete the dress			1
now @entity52 has designed the world 's largest wedding gown for her larger than life client , using endless billowing lengths of chiffon and lace to cover @entity8 's colossal curves			1
the one - off gown is so large it takes three people to carry it , and half an hour to lace up at the back			1
@entity52 , from @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , said : ' right now , it just fits snugly , and if she gains weight it will lace up looser in the back			1
' we 've never made a dress like this before			2
there are no dress patterns this large			0
' @entity8 said : ' when i tried the dress on , it was amazing , i felt like a bride			2
love at first bite : @entity8 and @entity28 met online and bonded over their shared love of food happiness : the morbidly obese heavyweight believes that her goal of becoming the fattest human will remove the stigma that fat is bad seeing as she believes she is healthy , her sons are happy and she has found love @entity8 's sister @entity46 said : ' i think she looks really beautiful in it			1
the dress turned out amazing			0

but we 've agreed we 're getting married , and he 's just waiting for the right moment			0
' @entity8 , who has given herself ten years to eat her way into the @entity108 , had believed until recently that she weighed nearly 800lbs after spending a year gorging on fast food , cakes , pasta , pizza , crisps and fatty snacks			2
fit ? ms @entity8 tries to stay mobile and healthy by swimming and ' waddling ' and though her doctors warn her against pursuing her dream of creaking the record , she believes she in no danger incapacitated : @entity8 's sister @entity46 , who will be maid - of - honour on @entity8 's big day , has to push her sister in a wheelchair to the dress fitting but after recently being weighed on special obesity scales , @entity8 discovered to her disappointment that her weight was actually 520lbs - almost 1,000lbs short of her goal weight of 1,600lbs			1
now @entity8 has her own goal for the big day : to put on weight			1
in order to ekep gaining the pounds , @entity8 must eat 30,000 calories a day , which she gets from meals cooked for her by her husband - to - be			1
@entity8 's doctor is opposed to his patient 's morbid mission - but @entity8 believes she can reach her target weight without endangering her life			1
@entity8 says she wants to try to ' break the stigma that being fat is bad '			2
' it 's helped me to find love , so what 's wrong with that ? ' she said			0
now that she has her wedding gown in her sights , @entity8 is hoping her chef boyfriend @entity28 will formally propose so they can start planning their big day			1
customising : seamstress @entity151 has to use about 45 feet of fabric to make the dress for the @entity69 native sizeable : ms @entity8 's waist measures a staggering 107.5in , or nine feet , around making this surely one of the biggest wedding dresses ever made do n't breathe out ! ms @entity52 anticipates the extra inches when the bride sits down in her gown ' it 's amazing to have something designed especially for me			1
normally i just buy my clothes from plus - size stores online			2
' i talked over designs with the dressmaker and she came up with a dress i 've always dreamed of			0
after having the girth of her 9ft waist measured , @entity8 tried on veils and head pieces , talking excitedly about her expectations for the wedding			1
' i 'm feeling like a bride			0
i ca n't wait , ' she gushed			0
' i like an off - whitish , not completely white			0
because if i wear completely white , i guarantee i 'm going to spill something on it			0
' ' i ca n't wait for @entity28 to buy me a ring so we can start planning a wedding date , and things like the flowers , venue , and the cake			0
' @entity8 , who earns a living by posting photographs for male fans online , met @entity28 over the internet last year			2
' i felt like a real bride ! ' @entity8 was overwhelmed with emotion when she tried on the fabric for her wedding dress after sharing emails and phone calls , the couple began dating , and @entity28 moved in to @entity8 's apartment a few months later			1
now the couple are inseparable , and @entity28 , who is currently looking for work , spends his days making delicious dishes , including his signature spaghetti bolognese , for @entity8			2
