scientists believe they may have found evidence to show that big cats really are roaming the @entity4 countryside , by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their ' victims '			1
from the @entity10 , to the @entity11 of @entity12 , big cat sightings have sparked the imaginations of many people over the years , although bar a few fuzzy photographs there has been little to prove their existence			2
now expert dr @entity18 believes he has found proof that big cats have been stalking @entity20 and neighbouring counties by analysing the remains of wild animals , which appear to have been eaten by beasts larger than any knows @entity4 carnivores			1
beastly goings on : scientists believe they may have found evidence to show that big cats , such as the ' @entity10 ' , spotted earlier this year , really are roaming the @entity4 countryside , by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their ' victims ' dr @entity18 , a senior lecturer in animal science at the @entity35 in @entity36 , has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons which all bore unusual teethmarks			1
some of the livestock and deer remains , found by farmers , landowners and volunteers , had been found in unusual circumstances which suggested that they may have been killed by a big cat			1
dr @entity18 studied the bones in order to figure out which animals had eaten them , and in a quarter of his samples found that the ' tooth pit ' markings made by canine teeth had been inflicted by an animal larger than those living in the @entity4 countryside , such as badgers and foxes			1
dogs ' teeth can leave behind similar markings , so dr @entity18 also examined the bones to look for markings made by the carnassial teeth - used for cutting flesh			1
these teeth are wider apart in a big cat than a dog , which would enable dr @entity18 to eliminate dogs as being behind the attacks , according to the @entity70			1
he was unable to reach a firm conclusion in 17 of the cases , but said that in the remaining three there were clear indications to show that big cats were responsible			1
one of the bones came from a wild boar found in @entity20 , while the others were from sika deer discovered in @entity80			1
some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers , leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the @entity92 act the scientist is now hoping to uncover more evidence , including fresh carcasses which may show traces of feline dna , before his research is publish in the @entity99			1
' all three are certainly wider than you would expect to find in a dog imprint ' , he told the @entity70			0
' but we need to let the sample size build up before we have anything approaching a statistical basis			0
' dr @entity18 said that his research was not the most conclusive proof of big cats , but added to the growing weight of evidence to suggest that big cats were living in @entity4			1
' we are excited as we are finding some tooth pits in many of the bones that suggest the animals could have been killed by a large - sized feline , but at the moment it is impossible to tell whether they have been caused by a domestic dog or big cat , ' he told local newspaper the @entity122 last month			1
big cat sightings have been a regualr feature of country life , going back decades , such as in the case of the @entity127 , said to live in @entity128			2
more than 60 sightings of a large black cat have occurred in the area over the years and in 2005 , a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the @entity136 close to the moor			1
in 2005 a large cat scull was found in the @entity136 , on the edge of @entity141 , however , it was later found to have come from a leopard - skin rug the skull was sent to the @entity145 in @entity146 for verification			2
they determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard , but also found that the cat had not died in @entity4			2
in fact , the skull had been imported as part of a leopard - skin rug			0
some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers , leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the @entity92 act			2
in august , pensioners @entity166 and @entity168 told how they had spotted a big cat , dubbed the ' @entity10 ' , prowling through @entity170 , near @entity171 , @entity172 , eating its prey			2
there was a flurry of reported sightings of the creature in 2009 , with members of the public claiming they had seen a big cat lurking by the side of the road			2
in january last year dna tests were carried out on the carcasses of three roe deer found dead at @entity186 , near @entity187 , in a bid to establish how they were killed			1
one of the deer had its vital organs missing and had had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther - like kill - but the tests found no evidence of a wild cat , which many had called the @entity11 of @entity12 , being involved			2
in february 2012 , grainy film footage emerged online showing what appears to be a 6ft - long beast slinking across a field just three miles from @entity203			0
teaching assistant @entity204 , who lives in the area , said she had spotted the large black animal - dubbed the ' @entity11 ' , five times before shooting the video			0
she said her first sighting came in july 2009 , when she saw the panther - like creature crossing a field near her house in @entity214 , near @entity187			0
also in february 2012 , a gigantic paw print was discovered in the @entity218 near @entity219 , this size of which correlated with the paw of a big cat , according to wildlife experts , and were unlikely to be those of a fox - unless it was an extremely large one			0
the @entity218 have been the site of several reported big cat sightings in recent years , and savaged carcasses discovered in the @entity228 added weight to claims that at least one giant beast is living there			0
in july last year , sir @entity233 claimed a beast had been on his land and that animals had been killed at the 98 - acre @entity237			0
a major hunt for a creature nicknamed ' the @entity240 ' was underway in august 2012 , when photographs of what appeared to be a lion spotted near a caravan park at @entity245 were handed to police			0
police and zoo workers armed with tranquilliser guns were scrambled to hunt for the @entity240 , only for the creature to be exposed as a domestic cat following reports of a wild animal on the loose , armed officers and two police helicopters using heat - seeking equipment , which cost Â£ 880 an hour to run , were scrambled			0
workers from nearby @entity258 carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors			0
caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre			0
however , the creature was later revealed to be a domestic cat , named @entity266			0
the @entity267 conducted an official investigation into the ' beast ' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming @entity4 in 1995			0
it concluded there was no ' verifiable evidence ' of exotic felines loose in @entity4			0
however , it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were ' not present ' .			1

bones of wild animals found dead analysed for unusual teeth marks
dr @entity18 studied bones animals found around @entity20
marks on three sets of bones indicated that big cats were responsible
