you probably associate @entity2 football with defenders			0
and you 'd be right ; @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 defended the blue shirt with style and steel			0
those thoroughbreds made goal prevention an art. but the @entity15 also pride themselves on their goalscorers			1
from thick - necked battering rams to heaven - sent magicians			2
last week an excellent column by @entity22 's @entity21 bemoaned the lack of goalscoring options available to national coach @entity25			1
it 's an uncomfortable feeling shared by fans			2
@entity15 's national team are famous for their defenders , such as @entity6 , who played with style and steel @entity15 are struggling for strikers ... defender @entity33 ( second right ) is top scorer since the @entity35 @entity36 is 15 months away and the four - times world champions do n't have a regular source of goals			1
agricultural defender @entity33 is the top scorer of the @entity25 era ( since the @entity42 ) with two strikes			1
the @entity44 nostalgia for the old guys grows stronger by the game			0
articles lionise yesterday 's sharpshooters			2
the adored @entity54 , after whom @entity51 and @entity52 's stadium is named , shot @entity15 to glory in the 1930s			1
the @entity15 's late 1960s and @entity35 1970 renaissance owed much to the thunderous force of @entity60 idol @entity59			1
another granite - faced striker , @entity61 enjoyed a short but colourful career with the national team in the early and mid- 1970s			1
in 1982 @entity65 spearheaded his country 's third @entity35 win with a craftier , subtle approach			2
there was a brief return to the dominant , blockbuster forward with the selfless @entity72 and blunderbuss @entity73			0
perhaps the most famous and popular modern @entity2 attacker , the masterly @entity75 , played alongside @entity72 and @entity73 at @entity76 , bewitching the football - loving world			1
his goals drove his team to the 1994 @entity35 final			2
in the past , players such as @entity54 , after whom @entity51 and @entity52 's stadium is named , shone @entity65 spearheaded @entity15 to the @entity35 in 1982 with a craftier , more subtle approach elsewhere , @entity61 ( left , pictured with @entity85 ) and @entity75 ( right ) live long in the memory @entity87 it does n't help @entity25 that four out of five of @entity90 's top scorers are foreign			1
@entity92 ' @entity91 , @entity93 of @entity94 and @entity96 's @entity95 are @entity97 , while @entity52 star @entity98 is from @entity99			2
only @entity100 ( @entity101 ) is @entity2 , but he is 37 and his career in the national team ended in 2009			1
@entity91 's principal partner at @entity92 , @entity105 , is a @entity106			2
@entity51 's regular striker force of @entity108 and @entity109 hail from the land of the tango			2
@entity112 rarely use an orthodox centre - forward , but rely on the pace of @entity117 @entity116 man @entity115			2
@entity118 and @entity119 are @entity25 's first choice partnership			1
after a typically honest but fruitless performance in @entity15 's 2 - 2 draw in rain - lashed @entity123 on saturday , @entity118 admitted : ' i was not satisfied with my performance			1
' only @entity100 is playing well in @entity90 at the moment , but he retired from international football in 2009 @entity118 ( pictured ) , along with @entity119 , are @entity25 's current first choice partnership the @entity130 man was subbed after 58 minutes of the @entity132 qualifier			1
journalist and broadcaster @entity133 says : ' @entity118 has good technique and physical attributes , but needs to be more consistent and a bit calmer			0
when he is having a bad game he loses self - control and gets booked too often			0
' @entity119 is suffering from a lean spell in the @entity142 with @entity143			0
the @entity144 is a direct , tidy player , but his confidence is low			0
@entity148 , on loan at @entity52 from @entity112 , is in a similar mess			0
a classic box player , @entity148 is only as good as the service he receives			0
@entity52 ' s struggles have reduced his efficacy and dampened his spirit			0
and before you ask , @entity156 's @entity155 is n't @entity25 's cup of tea , to put it diplomatically			1
@entity155 posted a picture of him in a mask to show his feelings after being left out of the @entity2 squad @entity25 does not have a large pool of strikers to choose from , and many are going through a barren spell the only good news from that draw in @entity170 was @entity172 's stunning 84th minute equaliser			1
the @entity175 - born @entity174 firecracker , unwanted by @entity175 chief @entity176 , has the flair and unpredictability to give @entity15 back its goals and smile			1
at 28 years of age , it 's unlikely @entity172 will make the impact of @entity75 or even @entity184 saviour @entity185			1
he might get his adopted nation through a difficult patch though			0
ranked by the joy they gave @entity2 football fans , here are five of the @entity15 ' s most cherished netbusters : @entity54 the undisputed leader			2
@entity54 ( 1910 - 1979 ) , known as the @entity196 of football , was acrobatic , a master dribbler and had an unerring shot			0
the first poster boy of calcio , he scored 33 goals in 53 international games			0
@entity75 anyone who saw the 1994 @entity35 knows the majesty of @entity75			2
enduring more aches and gripes than the cast of @entity209 , the gutsy genius dragged his team to the final			0
' @entity214 ' also shone at the ' 90 and ' 98 @entity76			0
27 goals in 56 matches			0
@entity65 his early performances at the 1982 @entity35 were pallid			0
but , with the unbending support of his manager @entity220 , the nippy little poacher sprung into life in the knockout stages , scoring six times , including a hat - trick against @entity175			0
20 goals , 48 matches			0
@entity59 still @entity231 's top scorer with 35 goals from 42 games , @entity229 's shots measured 140km/h , which would be closer to 200km/h with modern balls			1
known as the @entity235 , uncompromising @entity229 was instrumental to the @entity15 side which finished runners - up at the 1970 @entity35			1
@entity73 despite all the headlines regarding his hectic private life , brilliant ' @entity238 ' plundered five goals in a cautious @entity15 team at the @entity243 , and four more in 2002 in @entity244 and @entity245			1
a bulldozing , brave target man with outstanding aerial ability , he gave his team a brutish , @entity250 edge			0
23 goals , 49 matches			0
@entity54 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity255 captain @entity254 before the @entity257 final in @entity258 @entity73 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring for @entity15 in february 2004			1

@entity15 's top scorer under @entity25 is defender @entity33
the @entity15 do n't have a regular source of goals in their team
in the past , the national team have prided themselves on their scorers
previous striking *legends* include @entity272 and @entity75
