by @entity0 a mother - of - two has a terrifying condition which causes her body to swell up so dramatically she looks like she has been punched , @entity4 , 32 , has an extremely rare and potentially fatal genetic condition called hereditary angioedema			1
this causes her hands , legs , face , stomach and back swell regularly and , worryingly , her tongue and throat can also swell up , meaning she struggles to breathe because her airways are constricted			1
she said : ' people think my partner @entity24 ( right ) has hit me - it 's so humiliating for both of us ' she told @entity29 : ‘ it is terrifying when my tongue and throat swell up			1
‘ once my tongue did it and doctors thought i was a goner – i could n’t breathe and i thought i was going to die			2
' and when my face swells up it 's really humiliating - people stare at me and assume my partner @entity24 has hit me			2
' i get very defensive and i do n't like going out when it 's swollen			0
' ms @entity4 , from @entity41 , started to experience symptoms when she was just four			2
she suffered a bout of @entity45 measles and her knees swelled up for a few days			0
the condition can also cause ms @entity4 ' tongue and throat to swell up making it hard for her to breathe however , at the time , her symptoms were dismissed as an allergic reaction to the medication she was given for the illness			1
she then experienced no more symptoms until she was seven			0
at this point , her hands swelled up temporarily but again her symptoms were dismissed – this time as a reaction to a cold she was suffering from			2
when she was 14 or 15 her condition became much more severe			2
she started to suffer crippling stomach cramps and vomiting for about three weeks in every four			2
the condition is a rare inherited disease that causes swelling in various body tissues			1
some people have many attacks each month , while others will go months or years without a swelling attack			2
the swelling is caused by the poor functioning , or lack of , a protein in the immune system			1
if a person does not have enough of it , blood vessels can become leaky , allowing fluid to build up in the tissues			0
this can cause swelling anywhere in the body but is most common in the limbs , intestines , face and voice box			1
the swelling in the intestines often causes severe stomach cramps and swelling in the voice box can be life - threatening if it causes the airway to be blocked			1
the illness is inherited and a person can develop it if just one parent is a carrier			0
in this situation , the child will have a 50 per cent chance of developing it			0
there is no cure but it can often be managed by avoiding triggers and taking medication			0
triggers can include stress and some medications			2
source : all about hae during this time she also occasionally noticed that her legs would swell up			2
as a result of her illness , she was barely able to attend school and left with very few qualifications			0
she says that despite the severity of her symptoms , doctors never really investigated her illness thoroughly			0
over the years , she was given various diagnoses including a virus and iirritable bowel syndrome			0
ms @entity4 ’ mother experienced similar symptoms so believed she and her daughter must have a genetic condition which caused them to be allergic to their own hormones			1
when ms @entity4 , a customer services executive , was 16 her face swelled up for the first time and the swelling spread to her throat			1
she said : ‘ i was choking on what i was saying – i could n’t get any words out			0
‘ i felt like i had something caught in my windpipe			0
’ finally , when ms @entity4 was 21 , she saw a locum gp who noticed her hands were swollen			1
he asked her about the swelling and she explained the symptoms she 'd been suffering from for so many years			0
amazingly , this doctor believed he knew of a very rare condition she could be suffering from			0
he took some blood tests and a couple of weeks later , she was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema ( @entity148 )			1
the condition is a rare inherited disease that causes swelling in various body tissues			1
in ms @entity4 ’ case , the swelling tends to be triggered by stress			1
some people have many attacks each month , while others will go months or years without a swelling attack			0
ms @entity4 says the swelling on her face is sometimes so bad that people think she has been punched the swelling is caused by the poor functioning , or lack of , a protein in the immune system			1
if a person does not have enough of it , blood vessels can become leaky , allowing fluid to build up in the tissues			0
this can cause swelling anywhere in the body but is most common in the limbs , intestines , face and voice box			1
the swelling in the intestines often causes severe stomach cramps and swelling in the voice box can be life - threatening if it causes the airway to be blocked			1
she said : ‘ it was a bit surreal to be diagnosed after all those years but it was a relief to know what it was			0
‘ it was also scary because i then knew the full extent of my illness			0
ms @entity4 first experienced symptoms when she was four but she was n't diagnosed until she was 21 ‘ i was also a bit annoyed that i had been misdiagnosed so many times			2
’ as the condition is genetic , ms @entity4 ’ mother was also tested for it and the results confirmed her symptoms were also caused by hereditary angioedema			1
by this time , ms @entity4 had two daughters – who are now 14 and 11 – and devastatingly , they were both diagnosed with the condition as well			1
ms @entity4 said : ‘ it was guilt beyond belief when they were diagnosed – i could n’t believe i 'd cursed them for life			2
’ today ms @entity4 , who lives with her partner @entity24 , still experiences swelling every couple of weeks and each time it happens it lasts for a few days			1
ms @entity4 has to use walking sticks to help her get around when her legs have swollen up ' sometimes the stomach cramps are so painful i ca n't walk , and need crutches when my legs swell			1
' however , things have improved slightly for ms @entity4 as , since her diagnosis , she has been taught how to give herself an injection when she starts to swell up			2
these injections prevent the swelling worsening after it has started , but they do not stop it altogether			0
when ms @entity222 ' hands swell she loses her dexterity , and when her feet swell she struggles to get shoes on she said : ‘ my medication has never failed me yet but i am terrified that one day it could – if i left it too long when my tongue was swelling it could one day not work			1
‘ my partner gets really very worried – he is very attentive and will do everything he can to help me but i would like to think that maybe one day they could cure it			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone should have to suffer with it			0
’ she added : ‘ i want to raise awareness so everyone who has it gets diagnosed and gets the treatment they need			0
