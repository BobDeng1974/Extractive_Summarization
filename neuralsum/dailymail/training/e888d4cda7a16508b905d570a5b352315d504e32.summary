with thousands of anti-abortion protesters in town for the annual @entity3 , @entity0 were ready to push legislation through the @entity5 designed to please them			1
@entity8 leaders had planned @entity5 passage thursday of legislation criminalizing most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy , an act that would have defied a @entity5 veto threat			1
but late wednesday they abruptly postponed that confrontation indefinitely after concluding they were short of votes from their own caucus , after several women pushed back on a provision that would have required rape and incest victims seeking an abortion after 20 weeks to first report the crime to the police			1
instead , the @entity5 will vote on legislation today barring taxpayer funding of abortions — a prohibition that 's already largely in place			2
@entity0 say the bill will tighten the restrictions and make sure no funds flow to abortions under president @entity36 's health care law			2
anti-abortion activists stage a ' die - in ' in front of the @entity5 on wednesday			1
today marks the 42nd anniversary of the @entity42 decision in 1973 that established a nationwide right to abortion			0
every anniversary anti-abortion activists flood @entity46 and embark on a march from the @entity48 to the @entity49 in protest of court ruling the delayed bill would have allowed exemptions to the late - term abortion ban for victims of rape or incest and in cases when a woman 's life was in danger			1
but @entity8 leaders ran into problems when some @entity8 women , including rep. @entity64 of @entity65 and rep. @entity66 of @entity67 , and other lawmakers argued that requiring victims to contact the police put unfair pressure on those who have already suffered			1
a 2013 @entity73 report calculated that only 35 percent of rapes and sexual assaults were reported to police			2
the statistics also served as the basis for the @entity5 's veto threat			2
political pressures cut both ways for @entity0			0
leaders had resisted the awkwardness of postponing a high - profile abortion vote scheduled for the day of anti-abortion activists ' annual march to the @entity49 to protest its 1973 decision legalizing the procedure			2
and they did n't want to push anti-abortion legislation through the @entity5 that was opposed by @entity8 women , especially as the party tries appealing to more female voters ahead of the 2016 elections			1
yet when the leaders considered eliminating the requirement that rapes and incest be previously reported , they encountered objections from anti-abortion groups , @entity8 aides said			1
they chose not to anger that powerful @entity8 constituency			2
the breakdown showcased @entity8 leaders ' struggles to keep its members united the @entity8 - led @entity104 attempts to govern efficiently and avoid gridlock			0
' i ’m honestly stunned — what a complete and utter debacle , ' one conservative lawmaker who planned to vote for the postponed bill told @entity111			0
' i do n't see it as a failure			0
i see it as a victory in the process for getting legislation right , ' @entity115 rep. @entity114 , a sponsor of the postponed bill , said in an interview with the @entity122 @entity123 , president of the conservative @entity124 , expressed disappointment that ' a handful ' of lawmakers had forced a delay in the late - term abortion restrictions but added , ' we applaud the leadership for remaining committed to advancing pro-life legislation			1
' @entity123 made a last - minute visit to the @entity134 on wednesday to meet with @entity0 ' chief vote counter			0
the conservative big wig told the @entity137 that a ' lot of misconceptions ' were involved in the kerfuffle			0
' we ’re talking about a measure that would limit abortions after five months , ' he said			0
' @entity145 is only one of four nations that allows abortions throughout the entire pregnancy			0
' sen. @entity150 , right , speaks during a news conference on @entity152 in @entity46 on wednesday , along with women 's health advocates to denounce ' @entity8 attacks on women 's health ' and the @entity5 's plans to vote on ' an extreme abortion ban			1
' sen. @entity158 listens at left			0
the @entity5 abandoned its plans to take a vote on the legislation late last night progressive groups and a handful of @entity166 lawmakers that included sens. @entity150 of @entity167 , @entity158 of @entity46 and @entity168 of @entity169 , held a press conference on wednesday to denounce ' @entity8 attacks on women 's health ' and the @entity5 's plans to vote on ' an extreme abortion ban			1
' after @entity0 backtracked , congressional democrats who solidly oppose the legislation , along with abortion - rights advocates , all but mocked the @entity8 's problem			1
@entity177 rep. @entity176 said @entity0 suffered ' a meltdown			0
' @entity179 , president of @entity180 , said of the bill , ' these attacks are so dangerous , extreme and unpopular that @entity5 @entity0 ca n't even get their membership lined up behind them			1
' the @entity184 celebrated the victory in an email to supporters on thursday , claiming @entity8 had to ' pull that bill because even members in their own party thought it was too extreme ! ' referencing the legislation that the @entity5 plans to pass instead , now insisted ' they have n't learned their lesson - they are still trying to strip women of their rights			1
' @entity5 minority leader @entity198 told reporters this morning that the new bill , banning health insurance funds from being spent on abortion , is ' much worse ' than the legislation @entity0 originally intended to pass today because it affects millions of women instead of thousands			1
' this is n't about any improvement because of the actions that were taken yesterday , ' she said			0
' it makes matters worse			0
' @entity198 said the legislation ' undermines the ability of of a woman to use her own money from her own insurance ' to pay for her own reproductive services			0
' this was not a success for women and their reproductive health , ' she said			0
@entity5 minority leader @entity198 told reporters this morning that the new bill @entity0 plan to vote on today , which bans health insurance funds from being spent on abortion , is ' much worse ' than the legislation @entity0 originally intended to pass the 20 week abortion band had virtually no chance of becoming law , thanks to opposition from president @entity36 and an uncertain fate in the @entity232 , where anti-abortion sentiment is less pronounced			1
the @entity5 said wednesday it was advising the president to veto the bill because it ' unacceptably restrict women 's health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman 's right to choose			1
' ' furthermore , the provision that requires rape and incest survivors to report the crime to a law enforcement agency or child welfare authority in order to have access to an abortion after the 20 - week mark demonstrates a complete disregard for the women who experience sexual assault and the barriers they may face in reporting , ' it said in a statement of administration policy			1
' research indicates that the majority of survivors have not reported their sexual assaults to law enforcement			0
' @entity5 @entity0 consider the bill an important statement of their priorities and a show of support for a vital issue for conservatives , though , and were ready to press on , despite threats from the @entity5			2
supporters named their measure the @entity272			0
but @entity166 touted arguments by doctors ' groups like the @entity104 , which have cited research indicating that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester , which starts around the 28th week			0
and a report tuesday by the nonpartisan @entity281 suggested that the majority of women now having abortions after five weeks would move up their timeline instead of abandoning the procedure altogether			2
citing the federal @entity287 , @entity281 estimated that about 10,000 abortions annually are performed 20 weeks or later into pregnancies			2
the budget office estimated that if the bill became law , three - fourths of those abortions would instead occur before the 20th week .			0
