by @entity1 reporter published : 00:25 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 02:24 est , 10 december 2013 three courts have now denied the efforts of an animal rights group that was pushing for chimpanzees to be granted the same rights as human beings			1
the @entity8 filed three different lawsuits in an effort to get four chimps - @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 - the legal rights ‘ to bodily liberty ’ but the courts rejected their arguments			1
@entity13 , the 26 - year - old ape , is owned by @entity20 in @entity22 , @entity23 , and in spite of the animal rights ’ group claims that the animal is confined in a ‘ prison ’ , mr @entity20 said that the cage where @entity13 lives in is completely adequate			1
‘ i ’d be happy to show you @entity35 ’s home , to show you how well he is cared for , ’ mr @entity20 told @entity30 after the ruling against the lawsuit was announced			0
remaining with their owners : three lawsuits in @entity23 have kept chimpanzees ( similar to those above ) in the care of their owners even though an animal rights group wanted to have them placed in a sanctuary the group sought to have a court - backed order handed out that would free the four chimps from their caged confines , allowing them to live the rest of their lives in a primate sanctuary			1
' in this case , we are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous , ' the group ’s founder @entity53 lawyer @entity51 said			1
' that is , being able to self - determine , be self - aware , and be able to choose how to live their own lives			0
' even before the rejected verdicts were handed down , @entity51 said he did n’t expect the decisions to be favorable because the judges have no legal precedent to rely on			1
he added : ' we 'll take it to the @entity66 and then the state court of appeals			0
we 've been preparing for lawsuits for many years			2
these are the first in a long series of suits that will chip away at the legal thinghood of such non-human animals as chimpanzees			2
' the national group says it is dedicated to changing the common law status of some species other than humans			2
the group 's board of directors includes @entity51 and chimpanzee research pioneer @entity81			1
the lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities , such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices , and display complex emotions such as empathy			1
' once we prove that chimpanzees are autonomous , that should be sufficient for them to gain legal personhood and at least have their fundamental interests protected by human rights , ' @entity51 said			0
against his will : a nonhuman rights group sued a couple in @entity23 for illegally detaining their chimpanzee named @entity13 ( who is not pictured above ) in a cage on their trailer park and lost the case if the lawsuits had succeeded , similar ones were planned on behalf of other species considered autonomous , such as gorillas , orangutans , whales , dolphins and elephants			1
@entity13 ’s lawsuit was filed in the state @entity119 in @entity121 , while a different one was filed in @entity123 on behalf of @entity14 who currently lives in a cage in a brick building			0
@entity14 ’s owners @entity128 and @entity129 have said they plan to move @entity14 and other monkeys to a new facility on a large rural property			0
the third lawsuit were filed on behalf of the remaining two chimpanzees who are used as part of locomotion research at @entity138 on @entity139			0
all three have since been rejected			0
@entity141 , a professor of animal law at @entity143 who 's not part of the lawsuit , said chimpanzees ought to have recognition within the legal system			2
he said animals typically are protected by anti-cruelty and animal welfare laws , but prosecutors often do n't pursue animal cruelty complaints			0
he called the lawsuits ' unprecedented ' and said if they had succeeded , ' it would be the first time a court has been willing to step forward and examine the living conditions that a particular chimpanzee is in , and take jurisdiction over the chimpanzee and move it someplace more suitable to its needs			0

the @entity8 argued that four chimps in @entity23 were being ' detained against their will '
the group said that chimpanzees have the mental *capabilities* to make their own decisions
three different courts in @entity23 rejected all of the group 's lawsuits
