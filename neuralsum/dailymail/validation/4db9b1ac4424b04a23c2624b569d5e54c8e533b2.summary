' by simply plugging this device into any display , you can turn it into a computer			2
' it 's the perfect upgrade for an existing desktop and will be really useful for schools and businesses			2
' @entity0 also said it is releasing its cheapest @entity51 laptops yet , two versions priced at $ 149 aimed at undercutting @entity55 's @entity54 franchise and gaining ground in even more classrooms			1
various pc manufacturers have been working with @entity0 to design lightweight laptops running on the @entity7 operating system since 2011			1
the newest versions are made by @entity62 and @entity63			2
@entity62 's @entity51 can be ordered beginning tuesday at @entity65 and @entity63 's version can be bought at @entity67			2

pre-orders for that device began tuesday , too			0
as the prices for tablets and smartphones have been declining , it has forced @entity81 makers to lower their prices , said @entity84 analyst @entity83			0

@entity0 and @entity55 are releasing cheaper laptops and tablets in an effort to reach students , budget - conscious families and overseas markets			1
chromebooks have been steadily gaining in popularity , particularly in schools , as more applications and services made available over @entity101 connections — a phenomenon known as ' cloud computing ' that has reduced the need for hard drives			0
about 6 million @entity95 were sold worldwide last year , more than doubling from 2.7 million in 2013 , according to @entity84			0
in contrast , sales in the overall pc market slipped 2 percent last year , marking the third consecutive annual decline			0
@entity84 is projecting 8 million @entity95 will be sold this year			0
' it has been good news for consumers , but not so good for vendors , ' @entity83 said			0
the cheaper version of the @entity114 sells for $ 499 , compared with $ 799 to $ 1,949 for the higher - end models			2
the discounted version has a slightly smaller screen — 10.8 inches rather than 12 — a slower processor , and less flexible kickstand — just three angles rather than unlimited positions			0
the @entity51 has served a dual purpose for @entity0			1
like the company 's @entity125 software for mobile devices , the @entity7 system is set up so users will automatically begin using @entity0 's search engine and other services , such as @entity131 and @entity132			1
@entity0 has used the @entity95 as a prod to bring down the prices of all pcs , something the company wanted to do because it has more opportunities to show the digital ads that bring in most of its revenue when more people can afford to buy an @entity101 - connected device			1

( @entity152 photo / @entity0 ) ' we can not be happier that @entity55 is helping drive down the prices of pcs , ' said @entity156 , @entity0 's vice president of product management for @entity95			1
' if @entity55 is reacting to ( @entity51 's low prices ) , that 's fantastic			2
' unlike most computers , @entity95 do n't have a hard drive			0
instead , they function as terminals dependent on an internet connection to get most work done			0
despite those limitations , @entity95 have been steadily gaining in popularity , particularly in schools , as more applications and services made available over @entity101 connections — a phenomenon known as ' cloud computing ' that has reduced the need for hard drives			0
