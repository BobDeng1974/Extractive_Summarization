a federal judge ruled on tuesday that the self - described architect of the september 11 attacks will not be allowed to testify in the terrorism trial of @entity5 's son - in - law			1
@entity7 district judge @entity6 firmly rejected a request by the lawyers to call @entity10 as a witness at the trial of @entity13 using live , closed - circuit video from @entity15 , where @entity10 is imprisoned			1
at a hearing during an off day at @entity13 's trial , @entity16 told the defense that the testimony would be irrelevant because there was no evidence that @entity10 and @entity13 had ever met or even been in the same country			1
@entity13 , @entity5 's son - in - law and spokesman , is currently on trial in @entity26 , but @entity10 has said that @entity13 had no role in planning @entity29 operations he also criticized @entity13 's lawyers for making the request at such a late stage			1
' i have considered this very carefully , ' @entity16 said			0
' this is much ado about nothing			0
' when defense attorney @entity37 stood to try to argue further , @entity16 ordered him to sit down			0
' too little , too late , ' the judge said in a stern tone			0
' it 's not here			0
' prosecutors had pointed to a recent written statement by @entity10 that he would refuse to testify in the case as another reason to deny the defense request to call him as a witness			2
behind bars : @entity10 , the alleged sept. 11 mastermind pictured shortly after his capture during a raid in @entity51 , is currently locked up at @entity15 but shortly after the ruling , @entity37 sent the judge a letter saying he had received word from @entity10 's lawyer that @entity10 had now ' agreed to be examined without limitation on all relevant topics			2
' in a letter to the judge late on tuesday , assistant u.s. attorney @entity59 urged the judge to reject @entity37 's latest request , saying nothing the lawyer said made @entity10 's testimony ' material , relevant , exculpatory , non-cumulative or admissible			2
' @entity59 noted that @entity37 had cited a ' dramatically changed circumstance			0
' ' it is not , ' @entity59 said			0
the judge did not immediately rule			0

inside job : @entity79 is the son - in - law of @entity29 founder @entity5 the judge 's ruling also bars the jury from considering the 14 - page statement @entity10 provided in response to 451 questions from @entity13 's lawyers			1
in the statement , @entity10 said @entity13 had no military role in @entity29 - a claim possibly supporting defense arguments that @entity13 had no knowledge of pending @entity29 attacks when he warned on a widely circulated video after september 11 , 2001 , that ' the storm of airplanes will not abate			1
' at the same time , @entity10 's statement seemed to back the government 's position that @entity13 was a key player in @entity29 , saying fighting one of the world 's superpowers meant ' we would have to resort to a long war of attrition to which the military and media alike contribute			2
' @entity10 said he never personally spoke to @entity13 about plots to blow up @entity7 airplanes with shoe bombs in december 2001 , when @entity10 headed @entity29 's operations conducted outside of @entity110			1
