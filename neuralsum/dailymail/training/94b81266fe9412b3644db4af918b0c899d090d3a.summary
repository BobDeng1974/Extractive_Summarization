by @entity0 the childhood home of @entity2 , where @entity3 began to take shape as the pop sensation that would conquer the world , has been put up for sale			1
the humble three - bed terrace in @entity11 was home to @entity2 and his family in the 1950s and was where he and his friends @entity16 and @entity17 held their first band rehearsals			1
and though the house has been formally valued at just £ 75,000 , the owners hope the part it played in the @entity3 legacy will boost its value significantly			1
live and let buy : @entity3 star @entity2 lived at the above home in the @entity29 district of @entity30 in the 1950s and 1960s , just as his band with @entity17 and @entity16 was taking shape home boy : @entity2 is pictured left holding a guitar outside the front gate of his family home , while the same view can be seen to the right today @entity2 lived at the property with his parents until the early 1960s , by which point the band were well on their way to international super-stardom			1
the former council house was bought from @entity46 by @entity47 and @entity48 in 1983			1
mr @entity49 continued to live in the house until his death , which triggered the home being passed to his daughter , @entity53 , who is selling it			0
last year @entity17 ’s unassuming childhood home in @entity11 was snapped up at auction by a @entity3 fan for £ 480,000 - three times the initial £ 150,000 estimate			1
beatlemania : while @entity2 was living at the house @entity3 came into their own - and in 1963 , a year after the @entity62 moved out - the band had their first number one album @entity67 's @entity66 : the terraced , three - bedroom house , has a claim to fame for having hosted early @entity3 rehearsals			1
pictured here is the living room @entity3 ( hobs ) : pictured is the house 's kitchen			2
the whole property has been valued at around £ 75,000 , but its links to pop history could boost its price significantly @entity2 was only six years old when in 1950 his parents @entity83 and @entity85 moved to the modest council house , in the @entity29 district of @entity11 , close to where @entity16 lived with his parents			1
some years later the two youngsters met while waiting for a school bus and @entity16 convinced @entity2 , who had become obsessed with guitars , to join a band he had started with another friend - @entity17			1
the @entity2 family lived at the terraced house until 1962 when they moved to @entity97 in the @entity99 neighbourhood of @entity11			1
by that point the @entity3 were on the road to worldwide fame having just released their first single , @entity103			0
consequently , @entity49 and mrs @entity104 were constantly besieged by @entity3 fans			0
glory days : mr and mrs @entity104 had to fend off hundreds of fans who would set up camp outside their home since then the house has been lived in by several owners , the latest of which died recently and it passed down to relatives			0
they have now decided to auction the property following the huge success of the sale of @entity17 ’s first house at 9 @entity121			2
the auction will be conducted by @entity124 property auctioneers but the date of the sale has not yet been revealed			0
@entity129 , from estate agents @entity127 which is selling the house , said : ' we had a call from a lady who had inherited a three - bed terrace in @entity11 from her father who had recently passed away			2
' there was nothing remarkable about it whatsoever , until she revealed that it was where @entity2 grew up			0
yellow submarine not included : pictured is the bathroom of the home			0
the @entity2 family stayed in the property until 1962 , by which time the @entity3 ' popularity was well - established bed - in : the current owners will be hoping that that the house will suffer a similar @entity3 boost to @entity17 's old house , which more than tripled its auction estimate			1
pictured is one of the bedrooms where the heart is : a @entity11 couple bought the home from the council in the 1980s , but later died			2
their daughter is now selling the property ' we did a lot of research into the property and soon established that it was indeed where @entity2 had spent his years before joining the @entity3			2
' the house is just a typical terrace but inside it has been modernised and it could easily be lived in or rented out			0
' we are now in the process of arranging an auction for the house			0
' it is hard to know what a house of this significance is worth			0
we will not be publishing a guide price until much closer to the auction , which should take place in several weeks ’ time			0
' @entity17 ’s childhood home sold at auction last year for £ 480,000 against an estimate of £ 150,000 so we are hoping that a similar thing happens with this property			2
' the vendor is being realistic about the sale - he realises it could go for a life - changing sum of money but is happy to see what happens			0
' you can never underestimate the popularity of the @entity3			0
' outside : the former council property has an indelible link to the rise of @entity3 , and therefore to pop history a hard day 's gardening : pictured is the long garden behind the home in the @entity29 district of @entity11			1

@entity203 lived in the three - bedroom @entity11 terraced council house in the 1950s and 1960s
during that time @entity2 met *bandmates* @entity17 and @entity16 and rehearsed in the property
*harrisons* moved away in 1962 - just before @entity210 *exploded* - and new *tenants* later bought it from the council
the house , which passed to the next generation , valued at £ 75,000 , but it is hoped @entity3 connection will boost price
