@entity0 is to be unveiled as @entity2 's new batting coach following the controversial sacking of @entity4 earlier this year			1
the 45 - year - old @entity0 , who earned a reputation during his playing days as a technically impressive batsman who all too rarely fulfilled his potential , will assume his new role in time for @entity2 's one - day tour of @entity10 later this month			1
he has been appointed until september 2015			2
@entity0 will be @entity2 's new batting coach , filling the role of @entity4 @entity4 ( left ) , pictured with former coach @entity12 was sacked as @entity2 's batting coach @entity0 ( left ) has already been on @entity2 's coaching staff and has helped captain @entity15 he made a positive impression with the @entity2 batsmen after being invited to help out in the dressing - room at the start of the 2014 international summer			1
having formed a close working relationship with captain @entity15 , he will help out in every format			0
@entity0 retired in 2012 , aged 42 , with 114 first class centuries to his name but a @entity26 average of 27 @entity0 , who retired in 2012 at the age of 42 with 114 first - class centuries to his name , has said : ' @entity15 coped magnificently given the tidal wave of criticism			2
you did wonder if there was an agenda against him			0
' now he will be given the chance to cement his popularity within the @entity37 set - up as @entity2 embark on a diet of one - day cricket ahead of the @entity40 , which starts in @entity41 on @entity42			1
@entity43 understands @entity0 will not be involved on a full - time basis , as @entity2 seek to respond to criticism about their bloated back - room staff			2
but he will be used at some point in every series			0
many had tipped @entity0 's friend and former team - mate @entity51 to replace @entity4 in the role , but @entity51 's reluctance to re-embark on touring life pushed @entity2 in @entity0 's direction			1
his 11 - year international career , which brought him 52 test caps but only two centuries and an average of 27 , often felt symptomatic of an era in which @entity2 invariably fell short of expectations			0
critics will point out that he managed only a single half - century in 18 one - day internationals â€“ the format that will dominate @entity2 's schedule until the test tour of the @entity67 in april			1
@entity0 was technically gifted and brilliant at @entity69 level but never quite realised his potential for @entity2 but there is no doubting his long - form credentials and , following his last test in 2002 , @entity0 played on for another decade at domestic level , establishing himself as the pre-eminent run - maker on the county circuit and rising to national stardom in 2006 - 07 by winning the @entity79 's @entity78 competition			2
the occasionally tempestuous youngster who earned himself the nickname ' @entity83 ' gradually learned to accept his fate			0
@entity2 are now hoping to put his accumulated wisdom to good use			0
the former cricketer excelled off the field with victory in the 2006/07 series of @entity78			0

@entity0 has been appointed until september 2015
