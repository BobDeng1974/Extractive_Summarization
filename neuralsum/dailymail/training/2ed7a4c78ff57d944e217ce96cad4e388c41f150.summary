@entity1 mp @entity0 said it would be ' extremely unpopular ' but he would take the pay rise @entity1 backbencher @entity0 today became the first mp to say he would accept a controversial 11 per cent pay rise			1
the mp for @entity7 acknowledged that his remarks would be extremely unpopular but he had never turned down a pay rise before and i do n't intend to start any time soon '			1
it came as it emerged @entity12 and ministers could still pocket the inflation - busting pay hike as the main party ’s rowed back from vowing not to accept it			2
@entity18 refused to say that @entity19 would not accept the £ 7,600 hike recommended by the @entity21			1
and the @entity16 was forced to deny reports it was planning to block all of its mps from accepting the salary rise in a ‘ cost of living ’ stunt			2
instead @entity28 called for cross-party talks to stop the idea going ahead			1
@entity21 is expected to ignore public anger to confirm this week that announce salaries for @entity12 should rise to £ 74,000 from 2015			1
the dramatic rise will leave mps earning roughly three times the national average salary and comes at a time when most other public sector workers have had pay rises capped at just one per cent			1
all the main party leaders have rounded on @entity41 for ignoring the public mood when recommending the rise			2
but there is chaos in each of the main parties about whether or not they will accept the extra money			0
mr @entity0 claimed mps were being treated as ' cannon fodder ' in the row and the public did not want mps setting their own pay rates			0
he told @entity53 : ' this is going to make me extremely unpopular and my inbox is going to fill up with hate mail			1
' i have been a professional for 25 years and i ’ve never turned a pay rise down in my life and i do n’t intend to start any time soon			1
' and i ’m not going to turn the pay rise down because i do n’t want my constituents thinking they ’ve either elected a millionaire to represent them , or a saint			1
i am a flawed human being with many deficiencies , but i will be accepting the pay rise			1
' he said the public did not want mps to set their own pay : ' what my constituents told me and what the media told me is that they did n’t want members of @entity74 anywhere near their pay , and this is the consequence of that			0
' now , of course , if the prime minister and leader of the opposition do n’t like what is being proposed , they can scrap ipsa but then we ’ll end up where we were before , which is members of @entity74 – or perhaps , even worse , the prime minister – deciding on what we ’re paid			0
' worth it : an opinion poll revealed people in every part of the country thought @entity12 should earn less than their current salary of £ 65,738 , with @entity94 suggesting just £ 50,110 austerity : more than eight in 10 people said @entity12 should have a pay freeze or cut and less than a third thought @entity12 worked hard many people have been left baffled by the sight of mps claiming they do not want a pay rise - but doing nothing to stop it			1
the bizarre situation can be traced back to the 2009 expenses scandal			0
@entity12 pay had barely increased for many years , but perks to claim everything from taxis and food to furniture and home improvements became more and more generous			0
but the scale of expenses abuse was revealed , mps handed the right to decide their pay and allowances to the new @entity21			0
the move was intended to take the issue out of the arena of political controversy			0
but @entity41 has largely ignored warnings from party leaders not to push through a steep pay rise at a time when most people have seen wages squeezed			1
in an anonymous survey conducted by @entity41 earlier this year , mps suggested that they should be paid an average of £ 86,250 , with one - fifth of those questioned saying they should get £ 95,000 or more			1
defence secretary @entity133 yesterday warned ‘ this is not the moment ’ for a big pay rise and suggested the @entity134 would collectively vote to refuse it			1
but today @entity18 left the door open for the rise to go ahead , and suggested a decision might not be made for two years			2
asked whether the prime minister would accept the rise , mr @entity19 's official spokesman told a regular @entity144 media briefing : ‘ i do n't believe @entity41 have made a formal proposal yet			1
any proposal that they make will be reviewed in mid- 2015			0
‘ the prime minister 's long - standing position is that the cost of politics should go down , not up			0
‘ he does n't think that @entity12 ' pay should go up while public sector pay is being restrained			0
’ asked if the prime minister continued to have confidence in @entity41 , the spokesman said : ‘ he thinks that it was right for @entity74 to come together and make the decisions that it took with regards to making pay independent			2
’ meanwhile @entity16 has been forced to deny rumours that party leader @entity28 was planning to announce that 257 of his mps would refuse to accept the rise			1
a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ it is right that @entity12 ' pay is now set by @entity21			0
ipsa 's proposals are not out until thursday and when we receive them we will study them			0
in any case they will be reviewed in 2015			0
‘ we have always said that any decision on @entity12 ' pay must be taken in the light of the current economic situation and the cost - of - living crisis facing families up and down @entity174			0
’ mr @entity28 later called on @entity19 and @entity175 to enter talks on stopping the rise			1
he said : ' if the package of proposals being set out by @entity41 is as reported it can not go ahead			2
' @entity16 mp @entity181 today tabelled a motion warning against a pay rise at a time when public sector workers face a freeze or a cap on wages			1
he said : ' it is nonsense to suggest that if mps are not given this pay increase we will lose ‘ talent ’ to other professions			2
' mps should not be doing the job for the salary – i certainly did not check the salary before deciding to stand for @entity74			0
' mps ’ pay should rise in line with public sector workers			2
anything more would send the message that mps are out of touch with the rest of the country , and are not prepared to live by the rules they set for their constituents			0
' against : chief secretary to the treasury @entity213 told @entity215 he will not take the money also unhappy : labour leader @entity28 and deputy prime minister @entity175 have also blasted the figure @entity16 ’s shadow chancellor @entity218 has branded the idea of a pay rise ‘ preposterous ’			1
he said @entity41 appeared to have come to its conclusions ‘ entirely out of any context of the real world ’			2
however former @entity16 home secretary @entity224 said that while there is ‘ never a good time to increase @entity12 ' pay ’ refusing to do so would unfairly deter ‘ people from modest backgrounds ’ from entering @entity74			1
several mps including shadow health secretary @entity231 and @entity233 pensions minister @entity232 said they would forego the pay rise			2
@entity16 mp @entity181 @entity233 chief secretary to the treasury @entity213 said the public would find it ‘ utterly incomprehensible ’ if @entity41 defied concerted calls from mr @entity19 , mr @entity28 and @entity175 to show restraint			1
@entity1 mp @entity240 said : ‘ it is an inconvenient truth that @entity12 ’ pay has fallen behind other equivalent occupations for some years , such as the judiciary			0
’ but there was also anger that cabinet ministers like mr @entity133 , who earns £ 134,000 a year and made millions from business , are expected to call on mps not to take their pay rise			1
one @entity1 mp said : ‘ it ’s easy for ministers to tell the rest of us not to take the money when some of them are paid more than twice what backbenchers get			0
’ sources close to @entity41 said the package would be cost - neutral , with pensions cuts paying for the higher salary			2
but short of passing a law to abolish @entity41 , it wo n’t be possible to hand back the money			0
one insider stressed : ‘ they ’ll get the money			0
what they choose to do with it is a matter for them			0

@entity41 suggests increasing salary to £ 74,000 , almost *triple* the average wage
@entity224 claims rise needed to *attract* people from modest backgrounds
@entity18 refuses to say if @entity19 will accept pay rise
@entity28 calls for cross-party talks to block the increase
@entity288 @entity181 tables motion against ' ludicrous ' increase
