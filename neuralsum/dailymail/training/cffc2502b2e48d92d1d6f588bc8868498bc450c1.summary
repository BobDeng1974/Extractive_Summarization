@entity0 is proud of @entity2 ' history in the @entity3 and hopes he and his players can create some more at @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity2 's head coach grew up a @entity2 fan and experienced the highs and lows of knockout football following his team in the competition			2
he watched them beat @entity14 to win the 1972 final with an @entity17 goal , before they were denied back - to - back successes a year later when they were shocked by @entity5 in an all - time classic			1
@entity20 grew up as a @entity2 fan and wants to continue their proud @entity3 history when @entity0 was growing up , @entity2 were one of the powerhouses in @entity26 football			1
nowadays , they are struggling in the lower echelons of the @entity29 table the club has a very different feel about it now to then - owner @entity32 has overseen a cosmopolitan overhaul that was unthinkable when @entity34 and his players were @entity37 regulars - but @entity0 claims the club is still as focused on @entity3 glory as it was when he was idolising them on the television			2
' it was a big day for us which would start at 10am with all the interviews and i would be glued to the telly , ' the 49 - year - old recalled			0
' being a @entity2 fan and knowing about 1972 when we won against @entity14 , and then losing to @entity5 , they 're the games that stick in your mind as a youngster			1
' obviously , the great players that @entity2 had , @entity17 , ( @entity58 ) @entity57 , ( @entity59 ) @entity60 , these are people that have gone down in legendary history at @entity2 and they add to this romance that this football club has got with the @entity3 , so it 's important that we go up to @entity5 give a good account of ourselves			1
' @entity5 are @entity2 ' opponents on sunday , and the two teams contested a famous final in 1973 @entity0 believes that @entity2 ' loss to @entity5 in 1973 will still be playing on some fans ' minds the sides have not met in the cup since that final 42 years ago , and such was @entity34 's impact at @entity2 that @entity0 reckons revenge will still be on the mind of some connected with the club			1
' i would have thought so , i would see it as that , ' he said			0
' i have to say there are a lot of people here that i have met in my seven years that are associated with the club that associate with the @entity90 ways			0
' @entity2 could field players from as many as nine different countries at the @entity94 - players who by @entity0 's own admission have struggled with the demands of the @entity29 , where a winless december has left the @entity97 in relegation trouble			2
but the one - time semi-finalist with @entity100 thinks his foreign legion know what it means to do well in the @entity3			0
' i think they do , the coverage of all aspects of football in this country is top notch and they see the @entity3 as being a prestigious tournament , ' he said			0
@entity5 captain @entity111 holds the @entity3 aloft after his side beat @entity2 1 - 0 at @entity37 @entity5 goalkeeper @entity113 ( right ) made a spectacular double save in the 1973 final ' they understand it and they understand at @entity2 it 's important to win			1
when you enter a competition you enter it to win it and we 're in it to win it			0
' that is an ambitious claim considering @entity2 ' dreadful league form , with results leading to some reports suggesting @entity32 is ready to sack a coach for the third time this season			0
it is understood there is no immediate desire from the @entity136 to fire @entity0 and send him back to his old job with the academy , with the pair having spoken this week and finalised transfer targets , with @entity142 striker @entity141 likely to be signed on loan .			0

@entity0 grew up as a @entity2 fan watching them on television
he watched them beat @entity14 in the 1972 final , before missing out in 1973
in that 1973 final , @entity2 lost to @entity5 - their opponents on sunday
@entity0 wants to continue the proud history the club have in the @entity3
