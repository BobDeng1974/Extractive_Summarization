’ preacher of hate : the trio are also banned from associating with controversial cleric @entity20 @entity20 today insisted that @entity1 , @entity82 and @entity1 were ' fine , upstanding members of the community ' and called the order banning them from speaking to him ' unjust '			1
' i have not been convicted of any crimes , even though i do not believe in the law of this land , ' he said			0
' i am very proud of these people who study with me			0
they used to attend my lectures			0
they are fine , upstanding members of the community , of very good character			0
' they just wanted to speak out about the evils of alcohol , prostitution , gambling and drugs and support @entity7 law			0
' the oppressors are being allowed to reign which is why we are suffering these floods			0
it is divine punishment from @entity147			0
the government and judges are trying to curtail my influence			0
' in december last year , judge @entity190 jailed @entity1 for 68 weeks , @entity111 for 12 months , and @entity1 for 24 weeks			1
she told them : ‘ one of the many good things about living in @entity11 is the tolerance and respect members of the public generally show to one another ’s religious beliefs , his dress or his chosen way of life			0
‘ when on occasions a person shows their intolerance of another individual whether by aggression or violence and in such a way as to cause real fear to the individual then the law can be invoked to protect that individual			0
‘ this law would protect you if someone treated you in this way			0
it is the very same law that now brings you before this court for your conduct			0
‘ my understanding is that @entity88 is a peaceful religion and this conduct was unfortunately anything but			0
‘ you were acting together and very late at night and that conduct in particular frightens people and it frightened them with your aggression			0
’ despite receiving the longest sentence of the three , @entity1 , who has changed his name to @entity2 , has already been released because of time spent in custody waiting for sentencing			0
the court heard at sentencing that he has a wife and two young children , and has turned his back on drugs due to his ‘ religious calling ’			0
@entity1 is facing up to six - and - a - half years in prison for making the videos about @entity40 , including one where he laughed hysterically while driving past the scene of the murder			0
