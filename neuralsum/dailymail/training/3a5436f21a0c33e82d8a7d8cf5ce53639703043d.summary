a pensioner who manufactured fake detectors which he claimed could locate ivory , bombs and even help find missing @entity4 , has been jailed for three and a half years			1
@entity5 , 68 , had the devices made @entity7 before assembling them in his garden shed in @entity10 , @entity11 , along with his wife , @entity12 , 62 , who was given a suspended two year jail sentence			1
the couple were the final pair to be found guilty in a fraud case stretching back to 1999 which is thought to have netted a gang of con artists up to £ 80million			2
the crooks claimed the detectors could locate oil , drugs , and explosives up to three miles away , when in fact the devices were nothing more than empty plastic boxes filled with shredded paper			1
@entity5 , 68 , has been jailed for three and a half years after being found guilty of selling fake the fake detectors , which his wife @entity12 , 62 ( right ) was given a suspended two year sentence the couple claimed the detector , known as @entity33 , could help find bombs , drugs , ivory and even missing people such as @entity4 , while in fact it was an empty box filled with shredded paper the device came with a label attached to it listing the item it was supposed to look for , and the @entity44 claimed it used the body 's static electricity to power an aerial which would point to the object			1
despite the ' @entity52 ' science behind the device , known as @entity33 , the @entity50 government placed an order worth £ 1million , while @entity56 officials paid £ 25,000 for a single unit			1
the device even duped @entity58 , brother of journalist @entity59 , who championed it while he was the @entity61 's ambassador to @entity62			1
units of @entity33 were bought by @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity7 , and were also sold for use in the @entity68 in @entity69 while @entity61 troops were serving there			1
passing sentence on the trees at @entity73 , judge @entity74 said : ‘ you decided to market this device along with the other defendants previously convicted			2
‘ thereafter you commissioned the device ’s production in @entity7 , where the cost of an individual piece was just over £ 5			1
‘ you had the device stamped " @entity81 " , which in my view is plainly dishonest			0
‘ the device underwent various name changes over the years , but for all practical purposes it was the same thing			2
‘ the modest production cost is a reflection of the fact that this device was effectively a black plastic box , one similar to what might look like a small radio			1
the ' sensor ' had a label on the front listing the item it was supposed to detect , and the trees claimed the body 's static electricity powered an antenna which would point towards the object being looked for despite the ' @entity52 ' science behind the device , the gang of crooks that the @entity44 were part of managed to sell them to governments in @entity64 , @entity56 , @entity7 , @entity50 , @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity73 , judge @entity74 gave @entity44 a suspended sentence after hearing that she would not have been involved in the scam if it were n't for her husband , but will likely still lose her house ‘ the way in which it worked was that a piece of card or paper would be attached to it , an image reflecting what it was proposed to be looking for			1
‘ the aerial would then point to the vicinity or direction of the person or object being searched for			0
‘ one only has to look at the bare facts to see this as a bizarre and fantastic proposition akin to something out of @entity52			0
‘ this device was completely ineffectual			0
the basis on which it worked was a complete fantasy			0
‘ even if you had not written line by line your own sales literature , the most customary glance at it would had put you on notice that all manner of scientific claims were mad			0
‘ that you decided not to sell the products in this country and not expose it to closer scrutiny , suggests a great deal about your motives			0
’ fellow swindler @entity149 , 58 , from @entity150 in @entity151 was jailed for ten years last may after raking in £ 60million from the scam			1
@entity154 , also 58 , from @entity155 , @entity153 given seven years last august after making £ 45million , while @entity156 , 59 , from @entity157 , @entity158 , was also convicted last may			2
@entity160 , defending @entity5 , said : ’ it is agreed that mr @entity5 played a significant role in this offending , there can be no doubt argument about that			1
while the trees sold the detector under the moniker @entity33 ( far right , top ) it was also sold in variations called @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 ( pictured ) , which were all effectively the same product the @entity33 model , which was sold by the trees , consisted of a plastic box with an aerial attached , which would be filled with shredded paper , and cost just £ 5.10 to manufacture the couple bought the items , which were falsely stamped ' made in @entity61 ' , from @entity7 before selling them on for up to £ 25,000 to foreign governments ‘ mr @entity5 is content for me to say on his behalf that the role played by @entity185 herself is substantially different to his			1
‘ i submit on his behalf that had it not been for him she would not have involved herself in this plot			0
’ judge @entity74 added : ‘ financially this case will be disastrous for you because it will inevitably mean that you will lost all of your assets			0
’ the court heard that the trees will likely lose their £ 180,000 house and £ 10,000 at a confiscation hearing set for 27 february 2015			0
@entity199 was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work			0
judge @entity74 concluded : ‘ @entity199 , you are in a significantly different situation to the one of your husband in my view			0
‘ it is undoubtedly the case that you played a significantly lesser role			0
‘ you were concerned with assisting your husband , not marketing or selling like him or in training			2
‘ you were , i am satisfied , acting under direction from your husband and would not have become involved in this situation had it not been for him			0
‘ i have given anxious consideration as to whether there is scope for suspending your sentence , and i have by the narrowest of margins decided that by this lesser role this is just possible			2
‘ you should consider yourself extremely fortunate as you have come as close to anyone to receiving a custodial sentence			2
’ the devices were even sold to @entity69 authorities while @entity61 troops were serving in the county detective constable @entity226 , who led the investigation for the @entity228 , said : ‘ @entity229 and @entity199 were a couple driven by personal greed			1
they manufactured useless detectors which they knew were being marketed around the world as being able to locate anything from hidden explosives to missing persons			0
‘ the devices cost the couple only a few quid to make but were being sold on by agents for prices ranging from several thousand to half a million pounds , despite the fact they were nothing more than plastic boxes with a handle and antennae			1
‘ the sentencing of the @entity44 is the concluding act in a highly complex investigation into a global criminal network , which over a ten - year period turned - over up to £ 80 million			0
' thousands of false substance detectors were produced and sold putting both the users and the people they were bought to protect in grave danger			1
‘ the demise of these individuals sends a strong warning to anyone else who believes they can make criminal capital abroad while trading off the good name of @entity61 business			2

@entity5 , 68 , jailed for three and a half years after selling fake devices
@entity12 , 62 , given two year suspended sentence for her part in fraud
part of group selling devices they said could find bombs , drugs and people
