@entity0 is in hysterics , patting the knee of his @entity4 and @entity5 team - mate @entity3 when the talk turns to beetroot			1
i did n’t even realise until recently he worked at a beetroot factory , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it shows how far he has come ; i am so proud of what he has achieved			0
’ everything is new to @entity0 , the 18 - year - old left back who has been catapulted into a @entity18			1
it seems crazy to think that his first @entity18 memory is from 2006 when @entity5 were beaten by @entity22 in the quarter - finals			1
video @entity0 : @entity18 call - up was the best feeling in the world @entity29 : @entity5 left back @entity0 's first @entity18 memory is from the tournament in 2006 pals : @entity0 is proud of his @entity4 and @entity5 team - mate @entity3 ( pictured ) to travel to @entity35 ahead of @entity36 , the former @entity34 left back who played 107 times for his country , is something quite extraordinary			1
back in march , when he made his @entity5 debut against @entity42 as a second - half substitute for @entity36 , he was still living in digs in @entity4			1
he does n’t even drive			0
‘ i was in digs for three or four years and they were like a second family to me but i recently moved out and am going to get my own flat , ’ he added			0
‘ when i got my first @entity5 call , i was still in digs in the same place as one of the @entity52			1
‘ it is something i did for three or four years and i loved it			0
i did n’t feel i needed to move out soon because it was like another home for me			0
‘ i do n’t drive but one of the young lads drives to training , @entity60 ( who has just joined @entity61 )			0
after the @entity18 i am going to do that intensive course to learn to drive in one week			1
’ second home : @entity0 was still living in digs when he was first called up to the @entity5 squad this has been an incredible journey , and @entity0 was still taking it all in as he sat alongside his @entity4 team - mate @entity3 this week			1
making way : @entity0 is going to the @entity18 in front of @entity36 he only realised he ’d make the squad when @entity36 confirmed his international retirement on @entity73 on the final day of the @entity75 season on may 11			1
‘ my family were crying , ’ he explained			0
‘ but it was the best feeling in the world			0
i did n’t think i was 100 per cent going			0
i waited until the next day to see the squad announced			2
‘ it was something i had dreamed of , to represent my country at a @entity18			1
a few years ago i was sat watching @entity36 ( for @entity5 ) on tv ; i would n’t say i have taken his place but i have gone to the @entity18 in front of him			1
‘ when i look back , it is unbelievable how far i have come			0
i have had two years playing in the @entity75 , now i am going to represent my country at the @entity18			2
at times he nervously bites on his nails or chomps on some chewing gum as he spoke about his rapid progress at @entity4			2
his move to @entity90 is on hold , but he knows there are some big decisions to make when he returns from the @entity18			1
‘ that does n’t bother me one bit , i am here to play for @entity5 and that is all i am focusing on			2
’ during @entity5 ’s open training session this week , he was one of three players ( with @entity99 and @entity100 ) pulled to one side by head coach @entity102 as they walked off the pitch			1
‘ he just talked about the season , he has been to a lot of @entity4 games			2
it was a very tough decision between me and @entity36 but it was about form and the best players at this point			2
he said i ’ve had a fantastic season ; that is why i am here			0
’ @entity0 thing : @entity116 ; land boss @entity102 gives instructions to the @entity4 defender during training it seems incredible to think he was released by @entity34 when he was eight , the team he supported as a boy after being brought up close to their @entity124 training ground in @entity125			1
‘ i was let go because of my height , ’ he added			0
‘ i think it was only when i was about 14 or 15 i got bigger			0
‘ i ca n’t remember much about being released but after my first day on trial at @entity4 , i got a phone call straight away to tell me they wanted to take me on			2
’ he has graduated through @entity4 ’s academy , rising through the development teams to become the first - choice left back			2
deserved : @entity4 midfielder @entity134 is going to the @entity18 after a fine season for the @entity4 this week @entity4 fired under 18 coaches @entity137 and @entity138 , part of executive director @entity141 ’s battle for more control			1
‘ i sent them a text straight away to thank them for everything , ’ he added			0
‘ they meant a lot to me and helped me a lot with my development			0
i was with them from 15 to 17			0
they helped me massively ; when i saw the news i was very upset			0
’ the talent factory at @entity155 ’s includes @entity0 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , all first - team professionals at @entity4			1
‘ i do n’t know if it is any different to other clubs but the way we get brought up is very good , ’ he added			2
‘ we are all meant to be grounded			0
at other clubs there might be players who receive a professional contract and think they have made it			0
‘ if someone goes over the limit and starts acting big time , i ’m sure they will be brought down a peg			1
they ’ll be straight in a room with the boss and have a meeting to say this is not the @entity4 way			2

@entity0 , @entity134 and @entity3 all called up to @entity5 squad for this *summer* 's @entity18
@entity0 says @entity4 players are grounded and would be ' brought down a peg or two ' if they started acting ' big time '
*youngster* 's earliest @entity18 memory is the tournament in 2006
