by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 , the former @entity2 champion acknowledged as @entity4 ’s greatest swimmer , was furious at missing out on presenting the @entity6 medals for the event which made him famous			1
@entity1 , who triumphed in the 200metres breaststroke at @entity10 , was due to conduct the ceremony after @entity12 was beaten by @entity4 compatriot @entity13 in @entity14			1
but @entity1 , the first swimmer to wear a cap and goggles in competition and now a successful businessman , wanted to change into a suit before handing over the gongs			1
@entity1 made his upset clear but repaired relations enough to hand out the medals after the 100m breaststroke final the following night , with @entity37 ’s @entity36 taking gold			1
@entity14 hotels may have upped their rates out of all proportion with the standing of the @entity6 in the sporting calendar , but at least the event ’s top officials do n’t have the same delusions			1
games chief @entity46 , from @entity47 , is happy to be ferried between the venues in a homely @entity49 it ’s not the kind of vip courtesy car from which you would ever see football ’s @entity54 or cricket ’s @entity56 emerge			2
@entity59 chairman @entity58 made a hard - hitting speech at a supporters ’ forum over the weekend in which he described the @entity64 as ‘ overwhelmingly male , overwhelmingly white and increasingly irrelevant ’			0
@entity58 intends to make wholesale governance reforms , with every councillor undertaking equality training			0
hard - hitting speech : @entity59 chairman @entity58 was brutal about the @entity64 in light of @entity58 ’s comments , it is even more extraordinary that the @entity59 have allowed referees ’ chief @entity72 to escape after making a ghastly racist comment about an @entity75 it ’s not just @entity76 that regards the situation as a scandal			0
so do many of those overwhelmingly white male councillors , who said as much at last week ’s @entity64			0
the @entity6 rugby sevens has attracted more than 40,000 fans to @entity82 on successive days , demonstrating the popularity of an event that makes its @entity2 debut at @entity86			2
but @entity87 do n’t get the sport , judging by the decision to stage it in a temporary arena with a capacity of just 20,000			0
@entity92 flies into trouble there is disappointment within @entity96 that diver @entity97 had @entity99 scriptwriter boyfriend @entity98 with him on the flight from @entity101 that had to make a frightening emergency landing in @entity103			1
the @entity105 divers were returning from a @entity106 in @entity107 and the sport ’s authorities take the view they should have flown as a team rather than having partners or parents in tow			0
there is also concern @entity98 will turn @entity97 ’s head towards @entity117 , with the @entity2 bronze medallist having to deny claims he will quit diving before @entity86			2
disappointment : @entity97 missed out on a medal by 34 points , finishing fourth in @entity101 @entity124 , @entity4 ’s first minister , has promised not to turn @entity14 2014 into a @entity126 circus ahead of the september 18 vote			1
but @entity124 has made it clear in track and field circles that if @entity4 vote yes , he would like them to send an independent team to @entity86 , which would cause considerable problems for @entity135 however , the @entity137 granting @entity4 single - country status might not be as straightforward as @entity124 thinks			2
breakaway group : @entity124 wants to take a @entity4 team to @entity140 if the population vote for independence @entity143 , chief executive of the @entity144 , not only watched godson @entity145 win gold in the 50m butterfly but also ensured the swimmer ’s parents were able to watch the semi-finals			1
they had no tickets for the race until @entity143 intervened			0
the demise of @entity105 cycling since @entity156 suggests @entity158 ’s ambition of winning more medals in more events in @entity87 than they did in @entity161 is highly optimistic			2
it would have been more realistic to target beating the @entity164 haul			0
