a @entity0 supposedly spotted over an @entity2 suburb on sunday night has raised questions about just what the object was			1
with flashing coloured lights in red , green and blue the aircraft hovered over the south - east @entity10 suburb of @entity11 for over an hour , according to residents			1
one local told @entity13 the object was very strange and unlike anything she had ever come across before			2
' someone said it could be a helicopter but it ’s not moving , it ’s been there for an hour now ' , @entity16 said			0
a @entity10 resident captured this ' bizarre ' object hovering above homes in @entity11 she added she may be way off track and the strange aircraft could have simply been a plane but admitted it looked ' bizarre '			1
' holy moly this thing keeps coming back to @entity11 we need to figure out why ' , @entity29 from the @entity30 jokingly told @entity31 when asked about the object			1
' i saw it first about three weeks ago so i followed it because i thought " what is going on here " , ' mr @entity32 said			0
he trailed it close to a nearby park before he realised what it was			0
' if you went into the park i think you would find teenagers with some remotes in their hands he said , before mr @entity29 added he believes it to be no more than a toy drone or gyro - copter fitted out with some impressive led lights			2
' if not , we need to figure out what it is about @entity52 ' , mr @entity29 said			0
the object has been spotted numerous times in the area lately , hovering 100 - 200 metres off the ground , usually around 9pm			1
the aircraft was apparently flashing with blue , red and green lights but the @entity30 said it was nothing more than a drone or gyro - copter @entity0 sightings are reported in @entity10 at least once a week according to local monitors , and instances are apparently on the rise in @entity68 too			1
' in the last couple of years there 's been an increase of reports from the @entity74 area ' , president of @entity77 @entity76 told @entity31			1
she revealed her association gets about 100 reports per year , but they are just one of many groups around @entity2 keeping track of sightings			2
ms @entity76 said she herself had a number of sightings and what she described as a ' close encounter ' while living in @entity88			2
' i was living at @entity90 and it was in the early hours of the morning ... i saw three small beings standing beside my bed ' , she revealed			0
the creatures were apparently two to three feet tall with inverted heads and ' wrap around black eyes '			0
' i was terror - struck ' , ms @entity76 said			0
' people see things and try to put these experiences in context , which does n't always work ... there 's a high strangeness factor to these experiences people have			0
