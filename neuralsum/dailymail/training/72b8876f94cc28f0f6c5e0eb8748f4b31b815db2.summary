if @entity1 are to have any chance in this @entity3 they must play without fear or inhibitions			1
their mindset will be crucial in reaching the scores of 300 that will be paramount against the best sides			2
a score of 250 simply will not be enough in this tournament			0
in test cricket we now give players proper chances and back them , but we just do n’t do that in the one - day game			2
that means chopping and changing , which can lead to an uncertainty that reminds me of when i first became @entity1 captain			1
players think they might be out after one or two bad games and that can affect their performances			2
@entity27 will captain @entity1 at the @entity3 to be jointly hosted in @entity28 and @entity29 @entity30 lost his one - day captaincy for @entity1 on the eve of the @entity3 for instance , if @entity1 had changed their captain and gone with a virtually new top four just a month before the @entity36 they would have been castigated			1
so why is it allowed to happen a month before the @entity3 ? they have just about got the right squad now but it should have been in place a year ago			2
@entity42 is key the impetus for that right mindset must start at the top			0
@entity27 has to have a good @entity3 if @entity1 are to cause an upset			1
he is their gun player			0
we know captaincy has lifted his game but that can only last so long and could change if things start going pear - shaped for the team and the captain ’s mind becomes cluttered			2
@entity27 has been lifted by the captaincy and his form will be key to @entity1 's chances at the @entity3 @entity27 of the @entity60 bats during the @entity62 match in @entity63 ahead of the tournament age caps @entity27 ( capt ) 28 130 @entity67 27 12 @entity68 32 84 @entity69 25 12 @entity70 32 150 @entity71 29 114 @entity72 28 108 @entity73 24 44 @entity74 25 47 @entity75 26 7 @entity76 26 19 @entity77 24 43 @entity78 25 6 @entity79 32 44 @entity80 25 24 if @entity27 can stay uncluttered and start scoring expansive runs again it could have an enormous impact on the team			1
i like his captaincy style			0
he can think outside the box , wo n’t be afraid of doing his own thing and reminds me a little of @entity89 in his leadership			0
@entity27 must get the full support of the coaching staff in setting a positive example and getting the game plan clear in everyone ’s minds			1
keeping the faith you get massive ups and downs with young players and @entity1 have shown a reluctance to back them and give them a proper chance to sink or swim			1
we all know that @entity75 showed a few limitations last summer			2
@entity108 told me that @entity110 soon worked out how to bowl to him because he stayed legside of the ball and tried to play through the off			2
but @entity75 has n’t had a long enough opportunity to work his way through that , so we are going to the @entity3 with question marks against him and seemingly extra batsmen picked to cover for him in @entity70 and @entity69			1
that makes for a squad with one batsman too many and one all - rounder short , in my opinion			0
question marks over @entity75 ' batting has led to the selection of an unbalanced squad @entity75 loses his wicket while playing for the @entity130 in @entity28 's @entity62 @entity1 should have concentrated on what @entity75 can do rather than what he ca n’t , given him a run and seen if he can replicate his @entity135 form over 50 overs			1
as it is , we are still not sure going into the premier one - day tournament			0
then we have @entity140 , who smashed 77 off 37 balls for @entity142 against @entity143 in the @entity62 on wednesday			0
it makes me laugh to hear everybody immediately screaming that he should be in the @entity3 squad			2
just look at his scores and bowling figures over the past year for @entity1 and you can see why the selectors left him out			1
but why has his form been so bad ? and has it got anything to do with how he has been handled by @entity1 ? what has happened to him when he has pulled on the @entity1 shirt ? when he made that fantastic @entity162 century in @entity163 he had nothing to lose and was playing with no fear			1
that ’s the mindset @entity1 have to restore in @entity140 and instil in the players who are going to @entity28			1
omitted @entity140 hit 77 off 37 balls for @entity142 in the @entity62 on wednesday calls for @entity140 to be in @entity1 squad are unwarranted given his dismal record for his country for instance , we all know what ’s going to happen when @entity177 comes running in at @entity67 in @entity178 on february 14			2
he will have seen the footage of how @entity67 plays the short ball and his big back - lift			0
there will be bouncers followed by yorkers and @entity67 has to deal with that			0
but he has to be given licence to go for it and full support for the rest of the tournament if it does n’t come off in that first match			0
@entity1 should sit the young players down , tell them they believe in them and , crucially , consistently play them in their best positions			1
@entity194 made a valid point on @entity196 when he said that if you play @entity140 at eight he will bat like a no 8			0
if he was the right choice at three he should have stayed there long enough to prove it			0
@entity78 showed he can score runs at three in @entity203 but then was immediately pushed down the order			0
it does n’t lead to any sort of continuity or security in the side			0
@entity67 can expect to face bouncers and yorkers when he comes up against @entity28 's @entity177 @entity212 's a worry so there are concerns about the batting but it could be a case of better late than never with what is shaping up to be a decent line - up			1
i have more worries about the bowling			0
to have any chance of winning this @entity3 , @entity1 must take wickets in the middle overs and we did n’t see much evidence of them being able to do that in @entity203			1
yes , @entity72 and @entity68 are back , but they are not necessarily the answer to all @entity1 ’s problems			1
@entity72 can take time to get back up to full speed after injury , while @entity68 will need the white ball to swing if he is going to be a big force in this tournament			1
@entity79 has done well for @entity1 , better than people often give him credit for , but @entity28 and others will get after him as the @entity240 did in the one - day series last year			1
@entity1 will need as many bowling options as possible and the fact that they only have right - arm seam bowlers and off - spinners will limit @entity27 ’s decision - making in the middle			1
@entity72 ( right ) and @entity248 ( left ) return but are not necessarily the answer to @entity1 's bowling death bowling will be a concern at the @entity3 and @entity203 's @entity254 is the world 's best death bowling is the other big concern with the recent change in fielding restrictions			1
@entity1 simply have to get it right and they may be looking at @entity80 and @entity76 to do that			2
we hear old bowlers saying all the time that modern players do n’t bowl enough yorkers but that is only part of the issue			0
there is less margin for error these days as batsmen stay back in their crease and have the ability to clear the ropes with their big bats and innovative techniques if bowlers get it fractionally wrong			0
so yes , the yorker plays a part but it is about variety			0
@entity254 , perhaps the best death bowler in the world today , bowls all sorts of deliveries at the end of an innings			0
crucially , it is about executing all of them perfectly			0
hit the ground running the tri-series against @entity28 and @entity110 will go a long way towards deciding how far @entity1 can go in the @entity3			1
they will be playing the two favourites for the tournament and my hope is that @entity1 decide on their best line - up at the start and stick with it , as they do not have many chances now for the players to get used to their specific roles			1
@entity302 presents his pink cap to @entity304 during the @entity305 against @entity110 - @entity1 's performances against these two nations in the tri-series will gauge their chances cricket legend @entity310 wears a pink outfit for @entity312 in @entity63 a flag is unveiled at the @entity314 to commemorate the death of @entity316 from cancer @entity1 really should reach the @entity3 quarter - finals and , from there , there is enough talent for them to get on a roll and win three matches in a row			1
but they have n’t won three games in a row against top opposition for a long time			0
will @entity1 win the @entity3 ? probably not			1
can they win the @entity3 ? of course , but they will need a serious change in mindset			2
i think the public will accept a gallant failure just as long as it is not stodgy old @entity1			2
if they look to be dynamic , look to give it a real go , then we ca n’t have any complaints			0
it is just that it could have been so different with proper , clear thinking and planning			0
and with one - day cricket being treated the same as the test game .			0

@entity1 are in *disarray* and need to take a positive *approach* at @entity3
new captain @entity27 's form will be crucial to @entity350
@entity1 need to keep faith in young players like @entity75
@entity72 and @entity68 may not answer @entity1 's bowling
tri-series against @entity110 and @entity28 will gauge @entity1 's chances
