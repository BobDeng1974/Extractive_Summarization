by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 30 october 2013 from @entity8 , a one - eared teddy that belongs to @entity5 singer @entity4 to @entity7 's unimaginatively named @entity6 , photographer @entity2 's new book sheds light on a rarely seen side of some of the world 's biggest stars			1
but much loved is n't really about a-list bears			2
instead , it 's about telling the stories of 65 adored toy companions , old and young , from all over the world			2
' it was seeing my son @entity21 with his @entity23 , how he buried his head into it and squeezed it with delight [ that inspired the book ] , ' reveals @entity2			1
much loved : @entity30 's @entity29 ( left ) and photographer @entity2 's faithful friend @entity32 companion : @entity34 , who belongs to @entity35 and his son , has been stitched back together many times ' it reminded me of my own @entity32 when i was a child			1
so i thought it would make a good exhibition for my studio , which has a gallery space			0
' i had a @entity44 and all my clients brought in their teddies , surprisingly much more adults than children			2
' while waiting they would tell my receptionist some funny story or memory about their teddy and so i got her to write them down			0
i had the exhibition , put them on my site , and it went viral , 6.5m hits in a few months , all over the world			0
' among them is the grumpy looking @entity60 , a 24 - year - old toy that once lived in the cot of @entity30 and @entity23 , a ' fifty - something ' bear in a stylish knitted tank top that has been with owner @entity65 since the day she was born			0
adored : @entity67 's @entity66 ( left ) and eight - year - old @entity68 's much - loved @entity6 ( right ) cuddly : @entity70 's rabbit toy @entity71 ( left ) and @entity73 's 45 - year - old @entity72 ( right ) ' it ’s [ been ] very funny to see some people ’s reactions , ' adds @entity2 of the response to his photos			1
' most love [ the photos ] but some are horrified by the state of some of the teddies			2
' i ’ve also met lots of very angry adults whose parents thought they were doing the right thing by getting rid of their child ’s teddy			0
' more youthful bears in the book , include @entity66 , a striped pajama clad bear who belongs to six - year - old @entity97 ' @entity35 turned six in september , ' says his mother @entity98 [ not the singer @entity99 ]			2
' when he was born , he got the teddy as a gift from a friend of mine			0
' @entity35 calls the @entity66 , and he goes everywhere with him			0
i always know when @entity35 is tired - i hear him running upstairs to get @entity66 off his bed for a cuddle			0
' while most of the toys featured in the book were easy to get hold of , according to @entity2 , not everyone was quite so willing to part with their teddies - even for a few moments			1
famous bears : @entity7 's bear , @entity6 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) who belongs to @entity4 and his wife old boys : 32 - year - old @entity119 belongs to @entity120 ( left ) but at 104 , @entity122 's @entity121 is the oldest ' @entity7 ’s [ bear ] was fairly easy [ to get hold of ] and @entity4 ’s was the hardest , but only because it took about a year and a half to finally corner him , ' says @entity2			1
' normally you ’d bump into him here or there in @entity129 but typically when you actually want to , he ’s nowhere to be seen			2
' but once he and @entity131 [ @entity132 ] knew about it , they could n’t have been more helpful			0
it ’s getting to the right person is the key			0
' @entity2 's own bear panda also makes an appearance in the book and , according to the photographer , now lives in his studio			1
much loved by @entity2 , £ 10.99 , is published by @entity142			1
from @entity146 , the childhood companion of @entity148 reader @entity147 to the trio of teddies belonging to @entity151 that have racked up 150 years between them , the bears owned by @entity145 's readers are just as cute as @entity2 's subjects			1
we 've picked some of the cutest , coolest and quirkiest furry specimens for our @entity159 ' gallery below			0
loved : @entity160 , 24 , was given doodles on her sixth birthday but he still has a place in her heart best friends : @entity167 , 24 , with her much - loved soft toy , @entity169 , who amazingly , used to be pink twosome : @entity146 belonged to @entity147 while @entity173 was the companion of her late daughter old friend : @entity32 loved : @entity176 in the pink : @entity178			1
