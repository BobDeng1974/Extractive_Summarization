now the authorities there are considering bringing new war crime charges against him			0
but @entity14 's justice minister @entity29 has asked a court in @entity31 where @entity1 was a police chief to issue an international arrest warrant and make an extradition request			1
he said : ' this is one of the last possibilities for us to punish someone for crimes carried out during the @entity39			0

slow progress by prosecutors has added to worries about the direction of @entity22 under right - wing pm @entity112 ( right ) prior to his arrest : the @entity143 stand with their hands taped together in front of @entity1 's home recent months have seen something of a public rehabilitation of controversial figures , most notably of @entity150 , @entity22 's dictator from 1920 until falling out with his erstwhile ally @entity151 in 1944			2
