by @entity0 last updated at 1:37 pm on 22nd january 2012 under fire again ? @entity3 reforms introduced by health secretary @entity4 are expected to be criticised by an influential cross-party group of mps health secretary @entity4 's controversial @entity3 reforms are set to be heavily criticised by an influential cross-party group of @entity6 , it was reported today			1
the @entity10 are expected to say this week that the proposals were obstructing efforts to make the @entity3 more efficient and failed to address the needs of an ageing population			1
the committee , chaired by conservative former health secretary @entity16 have concluded the plan to restructure the @entity3 in @entity18 and devolve more power to @entity20 has made it more difficult to achieve the target of £ 20 billion in efficiency savings by 2014 - 15			1
according to @entity24 , a " late draft " of the committee 's report as says : ' the reorganisation process continues to complicate the push for efficiency gains			2
' although it may have facilitated savings in some cases we heard that it more often creates disruption and distraction that hinders the ability of organisations to consider truly effective ways of reforming service delivery and releasing savings			0
' shadow health secretary @entity43 said it was now clear mr @entity4 's reform plan had been a " monumental mistake " and called for a government rethink			0
' this report is a damning indictment of the government 's mishandling of the @entity3 , ' he said			1
' it is time for @entity53 to listen to what doctors , nurses and now his own senior mps are saying and call a halt to this reckless reorganisation			0
' health minister @entity61 , however , insisted the government was determined to put the @entity3 on a sustainable footing			1
' we all know the @entity3 is facing pressures from an ageing population and the increasing costs of medicines			1
that 's why we are spending an extra £ 12.5 billion on the @entity3			1
we have also made £ 7 billion in efficiency savings as performance has improved , ' he said			0
' these will all help in the short term , but if we are to put the @entity3 on a sustainable footing for the future reform is essential			1
our modernisation plan will put doctors in charge , slash bureaucracy and give much more power to patients			0
' legitimate question : deputy prime minister @entity84 told @entity85 today that @entity3 reforms had been scaled back but that change was needed deputy prime minister @entity84 said it was a " legitimate question " for committee to look at how the changes affected the ability of the @entity3 to meet spending cut targets set by the last @entity94 government			1
however , he warned reform in the @entity3 was necessary and the government could not ' stick our head in the sand and say ' no change '			1
' we have gone a long way to allay the concerns that people had about the original blueprint of the reforms , ' he told @entity106 's the @entity105			0
' we have said there is going to be no privatisation of the @entity3 by the back door			2
we have put competition back in its box			0
we have made sure there is proper accountability in the @entity3			2
' but people should n't think that the best way to cherish and preserve everything that we love about the @entity3 is somehow to freeze it in time and then it will all be okay			1
' our view is that these reforms , by making people in the front line more responsible for use of @entity3 money , actually help make the savings , not hinder it			1
' @entity129 chief executive @entity128 said : ' i am deeply concerned about the financial pressures facing the healthcare system in this country and the impact this will have on patients			0
' the full implications of this remain poorly understood outside the @entity3 , partly because politicians are reluctant to stand up and explain them			2
' if we are to keep the @entity3 sustainable in the long term , we need to be honest that this will mean fundamentally reorganising they way we deliver care in the best interest of patients			2
' some local hospital services will need to close or move into larger specialist centres			0
we also desperately need to strengthen care provided in the community			0
' this is so we can provide better care to the people who make up the vast majority patients in today 's health service : older people with various long - term conditions			0
' i passionately believe that the overall impact can be positive for patients , but only if we can get ahead of the curve and take the public with us			0
' ' from the outset , we have made clear that the government 's reforms to the administrative structures of the @entity3 are a distraction in terms of addressing these fundamental challenges			2
' we are therefore increasingly worried by the lack of clinical support for the reforms and the fact that clinical opposition to the changes has hardened in recent days			0

you ca n't restructure @entity3 and make cuts at the same time , committee expected to say
