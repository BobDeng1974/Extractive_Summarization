our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with @entity5 this is according to the @entity7 who is objecting to proposals by @entity10 to release a radio wave - guided lawnmower			1
it claims @entity10 's machines will interfere with its sensitive radio telescopes which astronomers are using to pick up signs of alien life			1
our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with @entity20 is according to the @entity7 who is objecting to proposals by @entity10 to release a radio wave - guided lawnmower			1
@entity10 is famous for creating self - guided roomba machines the problem is the frequency band proposed for the lawnbot is 6240 - 6740 @entity29 - the same one several large radio telescopes operate on			1
' we 'll see the whole thing with our electronics , ' @entity30 , spectrum manager for the observatory , told @entity34			0
' it 's a distortion			0
' @entity10 , who has created self - guided @entity38 vacuum cleaners , has filed a request with the @entity40 to use airwaves for its latest design			1
the @entity44 company says its vision is to create lawnmowers that are guided wirelessly from beacons on poles stuck into the lawn			1
existing models use wires hidden in the ground to set boundaries , rather using airwaves			0
astronomers that the frequencies @entity10 wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol – a key sign of star formation			1
there is already a ban on the use of mobile phone close to the @entity63 ( pictured ) in @entity64 , which the @entity7 owns the company claims its device could ' make this necessary chore easier ' and reduce the 38,000 injuries caused by walk - behind mowers each year			2
according to @entity34 , @entity10 claims the astronomers ' concerns are exaggerated and said the chances of its gardening technology will interfere with space exploration are ' infinitesimal '			1
but the @entity7 argues that the frequencies @entity10 wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol – a key sign of star formation			1
@entity10 has offered to place a notice in user manuals that states : ' consumer use only ; use must be limited to residential areas			1
' researchers at the @entity84 claim they have finally found the source of these ' alien ' signals - in their kitchen microwave for years , scientists have been trying to uncover the source of mysterious radio signals being picked up in @entity91			2
theories have ranged from evaporating black holes to extraterrestrial communication and mergers of neutron stars			0
now researchers at the @entity84 claim they have finally found the source of these ' alien ' signals - in their kitchen microwave			2
scientists knew the strange signals , known as perytons , originated somewhere near to the planet , but they had no idea just how close			0
the researchers were able to replicate the emission of perytons by opening the microwave door while the device was still running			0
within a fraction of a second , the microwave activity was picked up by the reader and the source of the perytons revealed			0
' subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be generated at 1.4 ghz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle , ' the authors wrote			0
but this does n't go far enough , say astronomers			2
they want the company to implement ' exclusion zones based on geolocation ' to keep lawnmowers at least 55 miles ( 89km ) from telescopes			0
@entity10 responded by saying : ' the @entity7 observatories for the most part are not closely surrounded by residential areas , at least no residential areas with lawns			1
' a review of the observatory locations on google maps also shows that many are surrounded by desert or forests , not environments where residential lawn equipment is used			0
' @entity7 replied : ' this claim is most charitably characterised as silly			0
' there is already a ban on the use of mobile phone close to the @entity63 in @entity64 , which the @entity7 owns			0
both @entity10 and the @entity7 have yet to respond to @entity143 for comment			2

@entity10 is creating wireless lawnmowers guided by radio waves
*gadget* and observatories will both use the 6240 - 6740 *mhz* band
astronomers say it could prevent them from detecting methanol
@entity10 says chances of interference *occurring* are ' infinitesimal '
