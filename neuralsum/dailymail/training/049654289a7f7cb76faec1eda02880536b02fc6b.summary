a striking black - and - white catalogue of images which document @entity4 's political and counter-culture graffiti scene in the 1970s is being republished for the first time in almost 40 years			1
the images , boasting complex slogans from ' strike a body blow to capitalism ' to ' the tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction ' , were part of the early work of acclaimed photographer @entity16 but were last published in 1976			1
lovers of art and underground culture have now succeeded in their bid to republish the collection , @entity22 , after raising more than £ 10,000 via the crowd - funding website @entity23			1
body blow to capitalism : striking photos of @entity4 's political graffiti which were taken in the 1970s including at @entity28 ( pictured ) are being re-released after almost 40 years			1
they were part of the collection @entity22 by @entity16 do not submit : this image in @entity33 , north @entity4 , sends a statement in an era which saw tension between people and those in power what does it mean ? the new edition of @entity22 , which was last published in 1976 and is now hard to obtain , will include a new foreword and expand on some of the stories and messages behind the often cryptic messages - such as this one in @entity47 while taking the photos mr @entity16 was the chief photographer for @entity49 , which he later left to work for @entity51 and @entity53 colour magazines , where he helped document the emerging punk movement			1
the book is thought to have been the first completely dedicated to @entity4 graffiti , and tells the story of the capital 's counter-culture and underground press through the poetic - and sometimes surreal - statements daubed on houses and iron fences			1
most of the graffiti in the book could be described as ‘ pre-renaissance ’ , according to the fundraising campaign 's founder @entity67 - as it was created before it was considered an art form in the eyes of many			1
while many of the slogans are political , there are also some which are irreverent and hard to decipher - from ' beware the thunderous trowel surgeons ' to ' @entity77 is @entity78 '			1
nowadays there is a wide gulf in styles of graffiti and how much they count as art. scrawled tags cost the @entity85 alone more than £ 3.5million a year to remove , and are a headache for authorities and residents alike			0
fighting the power : this slogan was daubed on a wall in @entity92 , @entity4			0
police complain that much graffiti nowadays is mindless ' tagging ' which costs millions of pounds a year to clean up - though political slogans have certainly not died away meaningless ? the messages raised the deeper questions about life , such as this one in @entity99 , near @entity100 , in around 1975 eat the rich : a woman walks past this slogan on a bridge - where there is also support for @entity4 football club @entity105 but @entity107 's chief constable sir @entity106 recently claimed ' tagging ' has declined - because social media has offered disaffected people a new platform to vent ideas which a decade ago ' would have been sprayed on the side of a building '			1
political graffiti has not gone out of fashion either			0
in protests against the rise in tuition fees in 2010 , students defaced @entity4 monuments including @entity121 and the statue of @entity123 with messages including ' education for the masses ' and ' * * * * the police '			0
but many political slogans have now been worked into visual metaphors			2
the anonymous artist @entity130 's satirical take on @entity133 's rise in @entity134 , @entity135 - which featured pigeons with placards reading ' @entity138 ' - fell foul of council officials who scrubbed it off after a complaint deemed it racist			2
other modern graffiti artists , meanwhile , create complicated murals - often with the permission of a building 's owner			2
a 300 - metre tunnel under @entity4 's @entity149 is nicknamed the ' graffiti tunnel ' and attracts tourists and lovers of urban art , with similar walls in cities across @entity156			1
simple message : this slogan in @entity159 , @entity160 , appealed to a now - unknown cause			2
@entity67 , 21 , who arranged a campaign to bring the book back into print , said : ' i ended up realising the incredible stories and people behind the pieces ' paperwork : this slogan in @entity47 called on the state and fellow dwellers of counter-culture to do away with bureaucracy counter-protest : it seems not everyone was so happy with the array of political daubings adorning the capital 's walls mr @entity67 , 21 , said : ' my friend and artist , @entity183 , posted one of the images from the book on his @entity187			2
' after fruitlessly trying to find a copy for less than £ 60 on the internet , i thought the best course of action would be to republish it			0
' he set out on a mission to have the book republished and managed to track down mr @entity16 ’s widow , @entity196			1
' she seemed so thrilled at the idea , ' said mr @entity67			0
' the more i researched , the more wonderful people i ended up meeting			0
from initially viewing it from the angle of a purely aesthetic graffiti book , i ended up realising the incredible stories and people behind the pieces			0
' some pretty unlikely names turned up along the way too			0
' @entity209 , the late jazz singer , wrote the original introduction for @entity22 and in the new edition it will be supplemented with a piece by artist and writer @entity214 , and an extensive foreword by mr @entity67			1
the book will go further than the original , outlining the stories behind the works and explaining their often cryptic sentiments , using exclusive first hand interviews with the people who painted the ‘ anonymous ’ statements			0
mr @entity16 was based in @entity4 for the majority of his career , studying at @entity226 before joining @entity49			1
irreverent : not all of the works by @entity16 were political			2
this slogan was daubed on corrugated metal in @entity232 , north @entity4 @entity233 : not much graffiti these days refers to radical 1920s art movements			2
this piece in @entity159 , north @entity4 , did just that trowel surgeons : a non-political slogan adorns a wall in @entity92 , west @entity4 , in 1975			0
much political and humorous graffiti has now moved into visual metaphors such as those created by the anonymous @entity130 , while police are left to deal with simpler tags celebrity culture : royal gossip ( none of it true ) infiltrated this piece of graffiti on a wall in @entity47 , west @entity4 , in 1975 not for dogs : a pet stands before another surreal slogan in @entity255 , south west @entity4 , in 1976			0
the collection of black - and - white images is being re-released after almost 40 years after a crowd - funding campaign by a 21 - year - old art - lover raised more than £ 10,000 acclaimed : @entity16 ( pictured ) took the photos while working for @entity49 before he moved to @entity51 and the @entity53 he was responsible for a number of iconic covers as well as music and fringe theatre photography			1
the @entity22 was initially published in 1976 before @entity16 moved on to work for @entity51 and @entity53 colour magazines , where he was instrumental in his documentation of the early punk movement			1
a number of his portraits are now in the permanent collection of the @entity271 , but his photography dwindled after he developing severe rheumatoid arthritis			0
in the mid 1980s , he moved to @entity274 and put his energy into restoring classic @entity277 cars until his death in 1991			0
the book is being released exclusively via @entity23 and has already reached its target			0
more information can be found here .			0

the @entity22 features the early black - and - white work of @entity16 but was last published in 1976
since then it was sought after by lovers of art and counter-culture and is now being re-released via *crowdfunding*
slogans include ' strike a body blow to capitalism ' and ' the tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction '
