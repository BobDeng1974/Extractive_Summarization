@entity1 's injury nightmare at @entity2 continued on thursday night after it emerged that he has torn the ligaments in his left ankle and will be out for at least four months			1
in a huge blow to @entity2 the striker , who cost them £ 15million last summer , will fly to @entity8 on friday morning to undergo surgery with a specialist			1
it is then expected that he will not return to action until december at the earliest , missing the crucial start of @entity2 's campaign			1
' the 25 - year - old flew back to @entity35 from @entity2 's pre-season tour of @entity37 after twisting his ankle badly			1
he was set to have intensive treatment on it and club officials were hopeful that it was only a minor strain			0
they were confident he would be fit for their first game of the season against @entity48 on august 16			0
but after further investigation club doctors discovered that it is far worse than they initially feared and that the ankle required surgery			2
the @entity35 international was unable to play last season until january after injuring his left heel and made only 16 appearances			0
that injury had completely healed and he was gearing up for the start of the new campaign by heading out to @entity37 for the club 's pre-season tour when this fresh injury struck in training			1
it is understood to be completely unrelated to the one he sustained 14 months ago			2
in the last game of the 2012/13 season he ruptured the lateral plantar fascia – the tendons that run through the arch of the foot , connecting the heel to the toes – in his right foot leaping for a ball against @entity30			0
under the knife : @entity15 has tweeted his dismay at having to be out for four months previous : @entity79 's son has a history of tweeting @entity2 's breaking news when he was thought to be on the mend , the medial one went and he was out for almost six months of the last campaign			1
having been on loan at the club from @entity87 for one season , @entity2 pressed ahead to make the transfer permanent last summer in what @entity90 described as a ' calculated risk			2
' the @entity2 manager was initially told that @entity15 , who has won nine caps for @entity35 , would only be out until september but he ended up missing the entire first half of the season			1
this was despite owner @entity79 seeking out a top specialist , @entity98 , and he spent time with the physiotherapist in @entity100 to help his recovery			0
it will be hugely frustrating for @entity90 that he will have to start a second successive season without his star striker			0
@entity15 has scored just two goals since he became their record signing and , on around £ 80,000 per week , their highest - paid player			2
he has so far cost them £ 1million per @entity111 game			0
fans will be hoping that this is the last of his injury problems , with his contract set to run for another five years until 2019			0
missing : @entity15 had to withdrawn from @entity2 's pre-season tour in @entity37 out : @entity15 was originally expected to recover from the injury before the start of next season			1

@entity2 confirm @entity15 out for four months with ankle ligament injury
@entity2 striker was withdrawn from his side 's pre-season tour *squad* as a ' *precautionary* *measure* '
