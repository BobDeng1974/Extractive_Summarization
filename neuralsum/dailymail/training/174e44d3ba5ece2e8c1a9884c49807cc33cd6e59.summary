@entity1 probe ran out of energy yesterday after it rested against a cliff or crater wall with little sunlight to recharge , but only after radioing back results of first and probably last batch of experiments to scientists it is a 10 - year mission hailed as a huge advance in learning about the darkest recesses of the universe , but that did n't stop the @entity1 probe from running out of battery power after just two days			1
the pioneering robotic spacecraft shut down yesterday after radioing results of its first and probably last batch of scientific experiments from the surface of a comet , scientists said			1
batteries aboard the @entity25 's @entity1 comet lander drained , shutting down the washing machine - sized probe after an adventurous and largely unscripted 57 - hour mission			1
carried aboard the orbiting @entity30 mothership , @entity1 floated to the surface of comet @entity32 on thursday , but failed to deploy anchoring harpoons			0
upon contacting the comet 's unexpectedly hard surface , it bounced back up into space twice then came to rest at a still - unknown location about 1 km ( 0.6 mile ) from its original target			2
photos and other data relayed by @entity1 show it finally landed against a cliff or crater wall where there was little sunlight to recharge its batteries			1
racing against the clock , scientists activated a series of automated experiments , the first to be conducted from the surface of a comet			1
@entity1 's last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars towards the sun , its batteries may recharge enough for a follow - on mission to learn about the chemical composition of organic molecules before dying , @entity1 defied the odds and radioed its science results back to @entity62 for analysis			1
its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars towards the sun , @entity1 's batteries may recharge enough for a follow - on mission			2
' perhaps when we are nearer to the sun we might have enough solar illumination to wake up the lander and re-establish communication , ' spacecraft operations manager @entity68 said in a statement			0
scientists are particularly interested in learning about the chemical composition of any organic molecules in samples drilled out from the comet 's body			2
comets are believed to be pristine remnants from the formation of our solar system some 4.6 billion years ago			0
they contain rock and ice that have preserved ancient organic molecules like a time capsule and may provide insight into how the planets and life evolved			0
@entity1 's drill descended more than 25 cm ( 10 inches ) on friday , penetrating the comet 's surface			0
@entity30 in august became the first spacecraft to put itself into orbit around a comet			0
it will accompany the comet as it travels towards the sun for at least another 13 months .			0

before dying , the washing - machine sized probe radioed results to earth
@entity107 landed against a cliff or crater wall with little sunlight to recharge
scientists had to race against the clock to start a series of experiments
@entity117 ran out after adventurous 57 - hour @entity25 mission
