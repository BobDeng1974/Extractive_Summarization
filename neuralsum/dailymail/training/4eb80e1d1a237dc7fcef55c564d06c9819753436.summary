the @entity0 came to a thrilling finale on sunday when @entity3 's extra-time goal earned @entity4 a 1 - 0 victory over @entity6 at the @entity7			1
it was a tournament full of stunning goals , epic entertainment , brilliant performances and many shocks			0
@entity14 's @entity13 reflects on the @entity0 and lists 10 reasons why it was the best ever			1
a total of 171 goals in 64 games , in fact			0
but who would have thought the two real pastings of the tournament would see world champions @entity33 let in five and @entity34 hit for seven ? unbelievable			1
it was as though everyone got together before the tournament and decided to go for it			0
just a shame no - one told @entity41			0
goals galore : @entity4 put seven past hosts @entity34 in the semi-final in @entity45 rout : @entity46 thrashed @entity33 5 - 1 in their group b opener that was a rematch of the 2010 final the goals , oh the goals			1
was the volley from @entity17 better than @entity53 ’s ? was @entity55 ’s long - range effort for the @entity56 better than @entity58 ’s freekick ? how about the execution of @entity61 ’s header again @entity33 , or could you even make a late argument for @entity3 ’s dramatic @entity0 winner considering the circumstances ? who cares , let ’s just celebrate them all			1
technique : @entity17 's wonder strike against @entity71 was one of the best goals of the tournament strike : @entity53 scores a volley for @entity76 against @entity46 in @entity77 the underdogs had their day and did n’t we just love it ? hands up who had @entity83 down to finish top of a group that included three former winners in @entity41 , @entity87 and @entity71			2
@entity4 needed extra-time and all of @entity90 ’s brilliance to see off @entity91 , @entity76 went toe - to - toe with @entity46 , so too @entity93 with just about anyone put in their way , and @entity97 almost beat @entity6 before @entity99 ’s injury - time winner			1
yes , @entity4 won , but it has been the most unpredictable tournament of them all			1
fairytale : @entity83 finished top of @entity104 and made it all the way to the quarter - finals @entity58 - did any player capture the rollercoaster emotions of this @entity0 better than the erratic @entity34 defender ? whether he was belting out the national anthem , belting the ball into the @entity114 ’ net before embarking on the tournament ’s most manic celebration or weeping at his country ’s capitulation , we lived it with him			1
@entity121 or the world ’s most expensive defender ? both turned up in @entity34 and it made for compelling viewing			2
high : @entity58 celebrates scoring from a free - kick against @entity127 in @entity128 low : @entity58 is helped off the pitch in tears by @entity132 after @entity34 's 7 - 1 defeat by @entity4 @entity135 's game of penalty poker			1
we were already looking forward to seeing the ‘ @entity140 ’ in the @entity139 next season before @entity141 took the bizarre gamble to substitute goalkeeper @entity143 with ‘ penalty specialist ’ @entity145 in the 120th minute of @entity46 ’s quarter - final against @entity83			0
the bluff worked as @entity145 ( two saves from 20 penalties faced at @entity150 ) won the shootout for the @entity152			0
madness or sheer genius ? does n’t matter			0
unorthodox : @entity135 brought @entity145 on for @entity143 just for the shootout against @entity83 hero : @entity145 makes a save in the penalty shootout against @entity83 that helped @entity46 into the semi-finals roar : the goalkeeper celebrates in @entity164 all smiles : krul with manager @entity141 when it comes to dirty tricks , we thought we ’d seen it all at the @entity0			2
from the @entity178 between @entity87 and @entity93 in 1962 to @entity180 ’s attempt to decapitate @entity181 in 1982 , the @entity171 ( 1986 ) , the elbow of @entity173 ( 1994 ) , @entity175 ’s headbutt ( 2006 ) and @entity177 ’s kung - fu kick ( 2010 ) , frankly we were running out of misdemeanours			0
@entity183 , take a bow			2
chomp : @entity71 striker @entity183 bites @entity187 defender @entity186 punishment : @entity183 was banned for four months after his bite during the @entity104 match @entity34 1 - 7 @entity4			1
it was sensational , it was jaw - dropping and at times it was almost too painful to watch			0
has there been another result quite like it in the history of the game ? @entity34 , in the semi-finals of their own @entity0 , letting in seven ? sometimes football has the capacity to transcend sport , to bring us a ‘ where were you when ’ moment , and this was one of them			1
@entity34 wo n’t appreciate it , but it has helped make their @entity0 simply unforgettable			1
demolition : @entity4 produced one of the most shocking results in @entity0 history by beating @entity34 7 - 1 @entity33 did n’t win again			1
admit it , we were all getting a bit fed up of tiki - taka and seeing @entity218 , @entity219 taking the proverbial out of a succession of opponents who just could n’t get the ball			0
after one @entity0 success and two more in the @entity225 , enough was enough			2
has @entity34 ’ 14 signalled the end of @entity228 dominance ? who cares , we just needed a break			2
end of the road : @entity33 's recent dominance of international football came to an end in @entity34 the celebrations			1
we know , every @entity0 has them			2
but this was a particularly vintage year			0
some will prefer the choreographed routines of @entity127 and @entity239 to the spontaneous outpouring of joy typified by @entity58 ’s @entity243 charge to the touchline , the stunned disbelief of @entity246 after he headed a late winner for the @entity56 or @entity248 and @entity141 also failing to connect with their high five on the touchline , but we loved them all			0
hero : @entity246 looks on in disbelief after his late winner for @entity56 against @entity239 in @entity257 @entity34 were the hosts			0
would it have been the same if @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and his ‘ gaffer ’ @entity260 had come to us from a studio set up on @entity267 ? would we be cooing at the sight of the @entity270 looming over the @entity0 final ? exactly			0
for those of us who grew up on @entity276 teams infinitely better than this one , the @entity273 nation can lay claim to being football ’s spiritual home and they produced a @entity0 worthy of that honour			0
gripped : @entity276 football fans embraced the @entity0 returning to their country from @entity286 's ' @entity285 ' to @entity17 and the grasshopper , here 's the 10 funniest moments from the @entity0			1
video countdown to @entity290 begins			0

@entity4 won @entity0 2014 after @entity3 's goal beat @entity6 in extra-time
this year 's @entity0 boasts a number of incredible *highlights* and *outstanding* goals
from @entity183 's bite on @entity186 to @entity61 's *diving* header against @entity33 , @entity34 2014 has seen enough to rank as the best ever
