by @entity1 reporter published : 13:44 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 1 november 2012 astronomers have discovered the oldest supernovae ever detected - two massive stars which exploded 12.5billion years ago			1
the cataclysmic events are known as ‘ superluminous ’ supernovae , and are up to 100 times brighter than other types of stellar blasts			1
they happened only 1.5billion years after the @entity11 which occurred 14billion years ago and their detection could eventually lead to finding the first stars that detonated			1
a high - resolution simulation of a galaxy hosting a super-luminous supernova and its chaotic environment in the early @entity19 similar to the one revealed today a supernova begins when a star burns out the last of its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity and blasts its outer layers into space			2
the star ’s core is left behind in the condensed form of a neutron star or black hole			0
the record is reported online in @entity33 and easily beats the previous most distant supernova found that was 11billion years old			1

superluminous supernovae were discovered only a few years ago and are rare in the nearby @entity19			2
some are believed to occur when enormous stars undergo a nuclear explosion caused by light particles converting into electron - positron pairs - beams of matter and anti-matter heading in opposite directions			0
such events probably happened more often in the early universe when massive stars were more common			0
this and their extreme brightness encouraged dr @entity56 and colleagues to search for superluminous supernovae when the @entity59 was less than four billion years old			0
using images from the giant @entity62 ( @entity62 ) the researchers calculated superluminous supernovae were at least ten times more common then than now			0
dr @entity56 , of @entity64 in @entity65 , said : ' here we report the detection of two superluminous supernovae that have slowly evolving light curves			0
' the extreme luminosities of superluminous supernovae provide a way of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the @entity11			1
' the detection presents the possibility of finding the explosions of the first stars to form after the @entity11			1

the cataclysmic death blasts occurred just 1.5bn years after the @entity11
new record beats the previous holder that was 11bn years old
