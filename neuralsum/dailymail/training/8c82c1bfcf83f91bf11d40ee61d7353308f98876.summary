businessman and father - of - four @entity2 has launched his own bin collection business in @entity4 where bins are being collected every three weeks a businessman has stepped in to offer rubbish collections after a council slashed its own bin - emptying service to just once every three weeks			1
it will cost families £ 8.40 a time , but @entity2 says there has been a ‘ tremendous response ’ to his idea			1
the enterprising 54 - year - old said he was prompted to act after realising how furious residents were about the council ’s scaled - back service			2
many were last week still waiting for their @entity21 rubbish to be emptied			0
the @entity23 - run council in @entity4 , @entity24 , began three - weekly collections in october , the first in @entity27 to do so			1
@entity28 in @entity29 , and parts of @entity31 , @entity32 , are also running collections every 21 days			0
town hall bosses say the move will boost recycling rates and save money for other frontline services			1
but so far locals have not been impressed and fear it is the precursor to a monthly collection			0
while some complained about wheelie bins bursting with three - week - old rotting waste and black bins bags scattered all over the streets , others said fewer collections were causing an increase in vermin and fly tipping			1
in some areas the situation was so bad that residents reported their bins had been ‘ secretly ’ filled by their neighbours or even stolen because people were so desperate to dispose of their rubbish			0
so it is perhaps not surprising that after canvassing 5,000 households in @entity4 , mr @entity2 – who is a managing director of a commercial waste company – found there had been a ‘ tremendous response ’ to his idea			1
his new firm , @entity66 , to be launched on march 1 , would charge £ 8.40 per bin and would collect every week – apart from the week of the council collection – and on the same day , so as not to confuse residents			1
it means anyone who signs up will be shelling out £ 327.60 every year , or £ 168 every six months , on top of their council tax to have their bins emptied every week			2
but unlike the council ’s waste , no rubbish collected by @entity66 would go to landfill , instead being all burned for energy			0
@entity80 was the first in the country to announce three - weekly collections and there are fears the new measures will see increased fly tipping and streets strewn with over flowing bins , which could attract pests mr @entity2 ’s plan is to launch @entity66 in a small area with one lorry , before rolling it out across the town , depending on demand			1
‘ the people of @entity4 want a service and i ’m going to provide one for them , ’ he said			2
in order to satisfy the @entity99 that all waste would be disposed of correctly , @entity66 will have a waste carrier ’s licence , and the company also has public liability insurance to protect its staff and customers			0
a @entity4 council spokesman defended the three - weekly collections , pointing out that recycling rates had improved from 47 per cent to 55 per cent since they were introduced , and the move could save £ 800,000 annually			1
he added : ‘ after only the first month , non-recyclable waste had reduced by 600 tons compared with the same month in 2013			0
’ a facebook page ' say no to @entity80 3 weekly bin collection ' has been liked almost 6,000 times @entity115 , of the @entity116 , condemned the switch to one council collection every three weeks			1
she said : ' i dread to imagine the consequences of rubbish remaining in a bin awaiting collection for three weeks especially during hot weather			2
' just think of a situation where those with babies have to dispose of nappies			0
' it will be horrendous and i can not understand why the council 's own health experts are standing by and letting it happen			2
it is a recipe for the spread of disease			0
' ' residents are paying for a service through their council tax and they are not getting it			0
' it is also the thin edge of the wedge towards monthly collections - i feel it is only a matter of time now before that happens which would be a disgraceful			0

@entity2 left angry by @entity80 's three - weekly bin collections
businessman has *decided* to set up private bin collection firm himself
he will charge £ 8.40 to empty a household 's wheelie bins when needed
said he is *concerned* bins will *overflow* and fly tipping will rise otherwise
@entity4 was first council in @entity27 to switch to three weekly bin collections
council claims it will save £ 800,000 a year and boost recycling rates
