now an advert which matches some of his gestures while speaking at demonstrations to archival footage of @entity6 was posted on a @entity12 blog dedicated to mocking @entity5 's opponents			1
mr @entity1 is regarded as the only opposition figure to have emerged in @entity12 in the last five years and gained political prominence when he started blogging four years ago			1

it is yet another attempt to caricature the campaigner who has also featured in cartoons as a fascist while raising his arm in a @entity45 salute for his pro-nationalist politics			0
