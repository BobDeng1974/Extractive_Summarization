the moon is tidally locked to @entity1 , which means its near side always points towards our planet			1
until now , researchers have debated why this near side has an abundance of dark features - most notable by the ' @entity9 ' - whereas the far side is much lighter scientists have revealed how the near side 's proximity to the scorching young earth weakened it and made it more susceptible to asteroid impacts that caused features like this to form			1
the reason the moon has dark patches on the near side ( pictured ) that are not seen on the other side is likely due to its formation			1
the moon was once up to 20 times closer to @entity1 , and side closest is said to have been weakened by the still - hot @entity1 a few billion years ago the dark areas we see on the near side , that resemble a face , appeared when meteoroids struck the @entity1 - facing side of the moon and created large flat seas of basalt that we see as dark areas known as maria			1
many researchers believe the moon formed after @entity1 was hit by a planet the size of @entity41 billions of years ago			1
this is called the giant impact hypothesis			0
the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago			0
the colliding body is sometimes called @entity52 , after the mythical @entity53 who was the mother of @entity55 , the goddess of the @entity56			0
no such ' face ' exists on the farside of the moon , and now @entity61 astrophysicists think they know why			2
' i remember the first time i saw a globe of the moon as a boy , being struck by how different the farside looks , ' said @entity68 , assistant professor of astrophysics at the university			0
' it was all mountains and craters			0
where were the maria ? it turns out it 's been a mystery since the fifties			0
' this mystery is called the @entity80 and dates back to 1959 , when the @entity82 spacecraft @entity83 transmitted the first images of the @entity85			0
neither side of the moon is ' dark ' in terms of light though - both receive sunlight as the moon completes its orbit and rotation around @entity1			1
researchers at the time noticed that fewer ' seas ' or maria existed on the portion of the moon that always faces away from @entity1			2
now the scientists , reporting their results in @entity102 , have realised that the absence of maria , which is due to a difference in crustal thickness between the side of the moon we see and the hidden side , is a consequence of how the moon originally formed			1
the mystery of the moon 's varying colours has puzzled astronomers ever since the moon 's far side ( pictured ) was seen for the first time in 1959			1
this image was taken by the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) in june 2009 the general consensus on the moon 's origin is that it probably formed shortly after @entity1 and was the result of a @entity41 - sized object hitting @entity1 with a glancing but devastating impact			1
this giant impact hypothesis suggests that the outer layers of @entity1 and the object were flung into space and eventually formed the moon			1
' shortly after the giant impact , @entity1 and the moon were very hot , ' said professor of astrophysics @entity138 , one of the contributors to the study			1
@entity1 and the impact object did not just melt ; parts of them vaporised , creating a disk of rock , magma and vapor around @entity1			0
' the moon and @entity1 loomed large in each others skies when they formed , ' continued graduate student and lead author of the study @entity153			2
the geometry was similar to the rocky exoplanets recently discovered very close to their stars , said @entity68			0
the moon was 10 to 20 times closer to @entity1 than it is now , and the researchers found that it quickly assumed a tidally locked position ( where the same side always faces our planet ) with the rotation time of the moon equal to the orbital period of the moon around @entity1			2
the same real estate on the moon has probably always faced @entity1 ever since			2
tidal locking is a product of the gravity of both objects			0
pictured is an artist 's illustration of what @entity1 and the moon might have looked like about four billion years ago			2
note how the moon is much larger in the sky as it is up to 20 times closer than it is now , and it 's near side is also subjected to the full force of the heat of the scorching young @entity1 the moon , being much smaller than @entity1 , cooled more quickly			1
because @entity1 and the moon were tidally locked from the beginning , the still hot @entity1 - more than 2500 ° c ( 4,500 ° f ) - radiated towards the near side of the moon			1
the far side , away from the boiling @entity1 , slowly cooled , while the @entity1 - facing side was kept molten creating a temperature gradient between the two halves			2
this gradient was important for crustal formation on the moon			0
the moon 's crust has high concentrations of aluminum and calcium , elements that are very hard to vaporise			1
' when rock vapor starts to cool , the very first elements that snow out are aluminum and calcium , ' said @entity138			0
aluminum and calcium would have condensed in the atmosphere of the cold side of the moon because the nearside was still too hot			2
thousands to millions of years later , these elements combined with silicates in the moon 's mantle to eventually form the moon 's crust			1
and according to the researchers , the farside crust had more of these minerals and is thicker			0
the moon has now completely cooled and is not molten below the surface			0
but earlier in its history , large meteoroids struck the nearside of the moon and punched through the crust , releasing the vast lakes of basaltic lava that formed the nearside maria that make up the man in the moon			0
when meteoroids struck the farside of the moon , in most cases the crust was too thick and no magmatic basalt welled up , creating the dark side of the moon with valleys , craters and highlands , but almost no maria .			0

@entity61 revealed *evidence* for the moon 's varying colour
near side is darker than the far side , but no - one was sure why - until now
scientists suggest this change is due to the moon and @entity1 's formation
early in its life @entity1 was scorching hot and heated the near side
this weakened it and made it more *vulnerable* to impacts , while the far side formed a thicker crust that was more *resilient* to *meteorites*
