no disciplinary measures were taken and in some cases perpetrators were promoted even after complaints had been upheld against them			1
the review found there was a perception within the organisation that @entity4 stars did not have to adhere to the same rules as normal staff because they could ‘ wield power ’			1
barrister @entity23 ( left ) compiled the report which director general of the @entity4 @entity26 ( right ) said made for ' uncomfortable reading ' it also said some on - air talent ’s behaviour was ‘ often inappropriate ’ and in certain cases should be categorised as ‘ renowned ’			1
barrister @entity23 ’s findings are particularly embarrassing for the corporation which came out on the same day its former presenter @entity34 pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls aged as young as nine			0
while the 80 - page @entity40 linked the ‘ untouchable ’ treatment of stars directly to bullying and inappropriate behaviour , rather than sexual harassment , it none the less added to the impression of a celebrity obsessed culture at the broadcaster			1

the long - awaited report into bullying and harassment at the @entity4 which was commissioned in the wake of the @entity7 scandal the report added that in sexual harassment cases there was a tendency for the victim to be ‘ young and in the early stages of their career ’ and ‘ almost exclusively female ’ while the perpetrators tended to be men and in ‘ positions of influence ’			1
victims had complained that they had ‘ nowhere safe and confidential to go ’ to report the problem and to ‘ see it acted upon ’			2
miss @entity23 ’s research found concerns about bullying and other forms of inappropriate behaviour were ‘ much more prominent ’ than sexual harassment			0
in this types of cases it was said that some bosses and stars were seen as ‘ untouchable ’ because of their ‘ perceived value to the @entity4 ’			1
the report once again created the impression of an organisation that was submissive to the talent it often pays large amounts of money to			2
it said : ‘ there is a perception that “ talent ” are treated differently and do n’t have to adhere to the same rules because they wield power over the organisation and anyone who tries to manage them			1
‘ in many cases , the @entity4 does not directly employ them and so people are quite unsure about what interventions are possible			2
’ the review said it had heard of examples of talent whose behaviour was ‘ often inappropriate ’ and their actions were what it would class as ‘ visible ’ and in some cases ‘ renowned ’			2
people who gave evidence to the review were said to have been ‘ fearful of raising complaints ’ about bullying and harassment , because they feared it would impact on their career			0
the report , which spoke of ‘ known bullies ’ at the corporation , noted : ‘ throughout our conversations we heard a strong undercurrent of fear ; fear of speaking out , fear of reprisal , fear of losing your job , being made redundant , fear of becoming a victim , fear of getting a reputation as a troublemaker and not getting promoted if an employee , or further work if a freelancer , supplier or contractor			1
’ one contributor told the review : ‘ people are afraid to complain , there is a huge fear of reputational loss and shame			0
these are the invisible silencing mechanisms			0
’ of the 37 cases of sexual harassment only 25 resulted in a formal disciplinary process			1
the report said the @entity4 had not been clear enough about the standard of behaviour that was expected from all staff including on - air ‘ talent ’			1

the report , which did not name any individuals , heard from 930 people ranging from presenters , senior bosses through to technicians and engineers			0
the @entity4 ’s management admitted some managers at the @entity4 were ‘ concerned ’ they would become part of a ‘ witch - hunt ’ by disgruntled staff as part of the process			0
while the corporation announced an end to gagging clauses it did admit it would continue to use confidentiality agreements where appropriate			0
@entity227 , general secretary of the @entity228 , welcomed action to tackle bullying , and said : ‘ it is quite clear that bullying has become an institutionalised problem at the @entity4 , one that has taken hold over many years			0
