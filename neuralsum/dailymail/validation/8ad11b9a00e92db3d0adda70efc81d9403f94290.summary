' it felt cold , rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one			0
' i knew @entity13 had once just hung out here and now i stood staring down everything that had been left behind			2
' i loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the @entity52 tub			1
' but the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time			2
' the room was bigger than three of my houses , it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end			0
everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust			0
' as i wandered the halls and rooms i imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls			0
' i looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties , tigers and celebrities			0

in 1995 @entity13 was granted parole and released from prison , returning to rural @entity11 in hope of escaping the media which ended up following him			2
because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $ 1.3m ( Â£ 870k )			1
it has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an @entity236 investigation when he tried to sell it - and is now set to be converted into a church			2
the current owners bought the property in december 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 , allowing @entity59 to explore before the work takes place			0
the property has had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an @entity236 investigation when he tried to sell it - and is now set to be converted into a church the mansion 's descent into disrepair could be said to mirror the former heavyweight champion boxer 's own fall from grace the current owners bought the property in december 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 he added : ' i 've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this			1
' but it 's definitely one of the more well - preserved structures i have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places			0
' it makes a perfect candidate for the church to move into and build their sanctuary			0
structurally the home is wonderful and i ca n't wait to see the restoration completed over time			0
' the group would like for @entity13 to attend the first gathering inside the churches sanctuary			1
' i hope to help by sharing this story far and wide , maybe bringing his attention to this matter			0
it could be quite an experience for him walking through his former home , seeing it brought to a completely different light			0
