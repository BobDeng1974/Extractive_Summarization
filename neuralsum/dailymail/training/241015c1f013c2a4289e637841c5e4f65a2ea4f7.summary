in his book , dr @entity0 points to a number of physiological features to make his case for why humans did not evolve alongside other life on @entity7 a @entity9 ecologist has claimed that humans are not from @entity7 but were put on the planet by aliens tens of thousands of years ago			1
dr @entity0 points to a number of physiological features to make his case for why humans did not evolve alongside other life on @entity7 , in his new book			1
they range from humans suffering from bad backs - which he suggests is because we evolved in a world with lower gravity – to getting too easily sunburned and having difficulty giving birth			2
dr @entity0 says that while the planet meets humans ’ needs for the most part , it does not perhaps serve the species ’ interests as well as the aliens who dropped us off imagined			1
in his book , humans are not from earth : a scientific evaluation of the evidence , the ecologist writes the human race has defects that mark it of being ‘ not of this world ’			0
‘ @entity42 is supposedly the most highly developed species on the planet , yet is surprisingly unsuited and ill - equipped for @entity7 's environment : harmed by sunlight , a strong dislike for naturally occurring foods , ridiculously high rates of chronic disease , and more , ’ he told @entity41			2
dr @entity0 says that humans might suffer from bad backs because they evolved on a world with lower gravity			1
he also says that it is strange that babies ’ heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth , which can result in fatalities of the mother and infant			0
dr @entity0 says that humans might suffer from bad backs ( illustrated ) because they evolved on a world with lower gravity			1
he also says that it is strange that babies ' heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth , which resulted in fatalities in earlier times no other native species on this planet has this problem , he says			0
he also believes humans are not designed to be as exposed to the sun as they are on @entity7 , as they can not sunbathe for more than a week or two – unlike a lizard – and can not be exposed to the sun every day without problems			0
dr @entity0 also claims humans are always ill and this might be because our body clocks have evolved to expects a 25 hour day , as proven by sleep researchers			2
‘ this is not a modern condition ; the same factors can be traced all the way back through mankind 's history on @entity7 , ’ he says			0
he suggests that @entity91 such as homo erectus were crossbred with another species , perhaps from @entity94 , which is the closest star system to our solar system , some 4.37 light years away from the sun. he also believes humans are not designed to be so exposed to the sun as they are on @entity7 , as they can not sunbathe for more than a week or two ¿ unlike a lizard ¿ and can not be exposed to the sun every day dr @entity0 said many people feel that they do n’t belong and feel at home on @entity7			1
‘ this suggests ( to me at least ) that mankind may have evolved on a different planet , and we may have been brought here as a highly developed species			0
’ ‘ one reason for this … is that the @entity7 might be a prison planet , since we seem to be a naturally violent species and we 're here until we learn to behave ourselves , ’ he said			1
dr @entity0 said the book is intended to create debate , instead of being a scientific study and hopes it will lead to people getting in touch with him with further suggestions of ' evidence '			2
while other scientists have said some bacteria arrived on @entity7 from space , @entity124 , an astrobiologist at @entity125 , said that to jump to the conclusion that it is alien life is ‘ a big jump ’			0
was this home ? dr @entity0 suggests @entity91 such as homo erectus were crossbred with another species , perhaps from @entity94			1
star @entity133 is pictured in the star system , which is the closest to our solar system some 4.37 light years away from the sun professor @entity139 from the @entity140 plans to investigate further , and believes that life is constantly arriving from space that did not originate on @entity7			0
dr @entity0 says that while his idea is an extreme evolution of that idea , it is intended to be thought - provoking and he claims to have had a largely positive response to it			0
he is interested in whether humans came to @entity7 separately , perhaps by arriving on meteors and comets , before evolving into the species we know today			0
‘ my thesis proposes that mankind did not evolve from that particular strain of life , but evolved elsewhere and was transported to @entity7 ( as fully evolved @entity157 ) between 60,000 and 200,000 years ago , ’ he says .			1

a @entity9 ecologist says conditions such as bad backs and sunburn suggest humans did not evolve alongside other life on @entity7
in a new book , dr @entity0 says aliens put humans our planet as recently as tens of thousands of years ago
he suggests the @entity7 might be a prison planet , since humans seem to be a naturally violent species and are here until we learn to behave ourselves
