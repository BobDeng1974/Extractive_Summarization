three people have died taking part in the drinking craze			2
‘ the @entity27 videos should be banned to protect the children , ' she said			0
‘ it is not appropriate for @entity6 to have these videos on the site when children can access them , especially if people have died as a result			1
i think it is ridiculous			0
‘ in reality children as young as eight are on @entity6 and they can see these videos which inspire them			1
@entity6 should stop allowing them from being shared			1
as a parent it does worry us that they can see these things so easily			0
‘ while i try and monitor my daughter ’s facebook i can only delete things my daughter writes , not what she sees			1
’ she said she allowed her daughter on @entity6 , where users should be at least 13 , to keep in touch with friends after moving to @entity63 from @entity64			1
mrs @entity31 said she was at work when police called to say a girl had been taken to hospital after drinking			0
@entity14 had to have her stomach pumped as a result			1
her mother , @entity71 , 32 , found her daughter riding home ‘ all over the place ’ with ‘ eyes rolling into the back of her head ’ on her electric scooter and still in her school uniform			1
mrs @entity14 , who then phoned an ambulance , claimed her daughter had been dared to down the drink after the girls had been watching @entity27 videos on @entity6			1
she said the act was filmed on a mobile phone and deleted soon after – but the families of the other two girls involved claimed they had no knowledge of this			0
police confirmed they questioned both @entity14 ’s family and her friends ’ families about the incident but decided no action was required			1
mrs leader , who has three children , two aged 17 and 14 , said : ‘ i had a phone call at work from the police saying my daughter and two friends were drinking and as a result one was sent to hospital			2
‘ they said it could be due to a @entity27 and asked if i knew what one was			0
‘ no one was in at the time , i was at work , and i was told the three girls had come into the house and taken a bottle of vodka from a globe in the house that opens			0
@entity14 's mother , @entity71 , 32 , found her riding home ' all over the place ' on her electric scooter , with ' eyes rolling into the back of her head ' ‘ they had been playing at one of the girls ’ houses down the road and then came to house			1
they took three plastic tumblers into the garden shed and that is apparently when @entity14 drank the mixture			1
‘ the other two did n’t want to drink it , my daughter has never drank in her life			2
’ she said she had been left totally ‘ shocked ’ by the incident as herself and her husband , a coach driver , rarely drank			0
she said : ‘ i ’m not a drinker myself , and as for my daughter , she ’s a normal 11 - year - old girl , she has n’t touched the stuff			1
she ’s a good girl who comes home from school and does her homework or plays round at her friends ’ houses			0
she is a normal 11 - year - old girl			1

’ her grandmother , @entity31 , 60 , called for @entity6 to stop fuelling the @entity13 craze – a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on the site drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol then dare their friends to outdo them			2
she said : ‘ it is absolutely shocking			0
i do n’t agree with the craze or @entity6 allowing them to be posted at all			2
it should be banned , it worries me that children younger than nine can be on there looking at these things			0
‘ they start playing games that mum and dad might play on the internet and then they just have to glance at something on @entity6 and they get these ideas			2
’ chief supt @entity181 , in charge of neighbourhood policing across the entire @entity184 , said : ‘ this case brings into sharp focus the rise of the influence of the @entity189 and the emergence of @entity13 in particular			0
‘ there is no control over the social media and the young people who get access to it even when they should not			0
‘ they see older teenagers doing it , and now even young children are doing it , they just copy their behaviour			0
there is so much risk around it , and i think this is what happened here			0
’ a @entity6 spokesman said : ' @entity6 's rules are clear , you have to be 13 to use our service			2

once underage profiles are reported to us , they are quickly removed			0
