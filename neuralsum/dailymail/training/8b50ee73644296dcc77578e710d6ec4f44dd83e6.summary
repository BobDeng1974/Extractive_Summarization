@entity0 face an increasingly difficult battle to explain @entity3 ’s bizarre behaviour this summer after the @entity5 champions ’ star player claimed he would be open to a move to @entity8			1
@entity3 has cast a cloud over @entity0 ’s post-season title celebrations with some peculiar antics over the past week			1
first , the @entity14 midfielder ’s agent @entity12 claimed that @entity3 had been upset @entity0 did n’t give him a birthday cake when he turned 31 recently			1
then @entity3 - who had actually received two cakes from the club admitted he would consider a transfer back to former club @entity19			1
speculation : @entity3 has fuelled rumours he will leave @entity0 by saying @entity8 move would be ' an honour ' fans favourite : @entity3 scored 24 goals in 49 games for @entity0 last season now @entity0 ’s top earner has given an interview to a @entity31 publication in which he reveals a transfer to the @entity31 champions would also appeal			1
@entity3 told @entity34 : ‘ given the goals of @entity36 , how could you not be interested in a club like that ? @entity8 have become one of the strongest teams in @entity42			1
it would be an honour to one day play for a club like that - if i can be of service			0
‘ given the magnificent season @entity0 have had , everyone talks about me and everything is open			2
my agent is hanging on the telephone and he knows what he has to do , i have complete confidence in him			0
‘ nobody knows what can happen tomorrow , my attention is on the @entity59 and we will see afterwards			0
‘ yes , i have said i would like to finish my career at @entity19			2
you never know because football moves quickly			0
’ @entity12 said last week that he rated @entity3 staying at @entity0 as ‘ 50 - 50 ’ and the player ’s comments about @entity8 will only increase speculation he is looking to move on			1
@entity0 are viewing the whole charade in its true perspective , given that @entity12 is prone to these bizarre tactics whenever he feels his star client is due a new contract			1
no comment : @entity3 failed to respond when asked where he would be playing next season @entity3 - who earns around £ 250,000 - a - week at the @entity75 - got himself a new deal last summer but wo n’t be so lucky this time			0
in all likelihood , he will merely have to explain his comments to manager @entity79 when he joins @entity0 for pre-season training in @entity81 after the @entity59			0
all @entity0 ’s @entity59 players will be given a month off from the day they exit the tournament , so it appears likely @entity3 will catch up with @entity79 in @entity85 unless the @entity14 progress beyond the last eight			1
birthday-gate : @entity0 posted a picture of the cake that was presented to @entity3 on his birthday @entity12 , meanwhile , continues to veer erratically from one standpoint to another			1
yesterday he suggested @entity3 would even accept a backroom role at @entity0 once his career is over			2
this is highly unlikely , especially as @entity3 ’s stock among supporters begins to fall			0
yesterday , for example , the @entity99 expressed the view that this latest episode has tarnished @entity3 ’s standing for good			0
@entity12 said : ‘ a role at @entity0 after his ( playing ) career ? of course			2
like @entity105 have done with @entity106 , for example			0
@entity106 played there and afterwards began working for the club			0
‘ @entity3 will need a club in the future			2
we do not want more money or a longer contract , anything like that , just the right attention			0
more attention on @entity3 and that he feels happy at the club — that is the most important thing			2
we do not need more money			0
’ comments : @entity3 's agent @entity122 has been in the public eye over the last week elephant : toure celebrating after scoring for @entity14 during the last @entity59 in 2010			1
