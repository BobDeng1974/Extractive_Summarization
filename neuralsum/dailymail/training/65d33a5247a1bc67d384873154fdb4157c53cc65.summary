@entity0 was 11 years old when he discovered what racism in football sounds like			1
barely out of primary school , he travelled to a game in the east of his native @entity6 , where a watching father decided to pick on the fact that he was black			1
‘ another kid ’s dad called me ... you know ( the word )			2
’ what he means is the ‘ n ’ word and he has a natural reluctance to speak it out loud			2
‘ i did n’t know how to take it			2
the whole game he was speaking to me and i started crying because i was small , 11 or 12 years old			2
‘ my dad came round			2
he did n’t talk to this guy , he talked to me and said , “ look			2
just show what you can do with the ball and that ’s it ”			2
and other parents came around and told the guy : “ what are you doing ? just be quiet and let the kids play			0
look how young they are ! ”			0
to @entity45 audiences he is the one who got away from @entity39			1
he spent a season there under @entity48 , being played out of position , before being offloaded to @entity34			1
since then he has become a vital part of @entity34 and @entity36 — winning the @entity42 , where for many he was man of the match in the final , the @entity41 , two @entity54 titles and the @entity55 twice			1
on tuesday , @entity34 resume their quest to win the @entity41 under @entity57 , taking on @entity58			1
how @entity39 , who face @entity60 the following week , would love to have him as a regular partner to @entity63 pair were close friends , first at @entity65 and then during their time at @entity39			1
as the son of a black @entity69 father and white @entity71 mother , @entity0 grew up in the multi- cultural district of @entity73 , in west @entity6 , so his @entity71 experience was far removed from the stereotype of the country			1
in such an environment , racism was rare			0
he had only heard the ‘ n ’ word once before that junior football match and , even though the context was different , it still retained its power to shock and belittle			0
@entity0 will return to @entity41 action when @entity34 host @entity58 in the last 16 the @entity71 defender celebrates after scoring a late winner against former club city last season @entity0 covers @entity34 coach @entity57 in beer after winning the @entity54 title last year aged 10 , he featured in a rap music video , playing the part of the black @entity39 as a child			1
afterwards , the rappers , in an attempt to be friendly , used the ‘ n ’ word to him , as young black @entity97 often do as a term of comradeship			2
‘ i was making a music video and there were @entity71 rappers and i played him as a small guy , ’ says @entity0 , ‘ afterwards they called me : “ hey , you little			1
and i just ran away and started crying because i never heard this word used against me			0
and then they came and tried to ( explain )			0
i was 10 years old — and that ’s what i experienced , when i cried two times			0
‘ then i spoke with my mum about it and she explained a lot of stuff to me and that ’s she jealous of my colour and stuff like this			0
she said they do n’t know , they are just jealous and to be proud that i had a colour like this			0
it was really good to know — she gave me a good feeling			0
’ the incidents are footnotes in his bigger story but colour is a part of his story			0
he represents modern @entity36 , just as @entity132 and @entity133 also do with their respective @entity135 and @entity136 roots			1
@entity0 ’s half - brother , the former @entity138 and @entity139 player , @entity137 , opted to play for @entity140			1
for @entity0 , whose father was always involved in his upbringing and lived near him despite the fact that his parents split when he was young , there were no mixed loyalties			1
‘ it was always @entity36 for me , 100 per cent			1
i know these people are just dumb , stupid , ’ he said			0
‘ where i grew up it was multi- cultural from the first day , as i had a lot of friends who are half this and half this			0
i have a lot of @entity71 friends also			0
how i am now , it ’s because i grew up in @entity6 with so many different cultures			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity36 team - mates after being crowned @entity161 champions @entity0 makes a last ditch tackle to deny @entity163 and @entity164 in the final against @entity166 @entity0 is part of @entity36 's new multi-cultural generation that includes @entity169 ( 2nd right ) @entity0 celebrates with the @entity41 after winning the @entity41 in 2013 he appreciates the importance of his story domestically and globally			1
he is currently one of the vice- captains of the @entity71 national team , with @entity175 the main captain			2
should he one day captain the team , it would send an important message — though he is clear he sees that as a future event rather than something imminent , as he feels a recent interview made it look as though he was lobbying for the job			2
‘ i just want to explain again because they took it as though i want to be captain now			2
‘ it ’s not like i want to take something from @entity175			0
@entity190 ( the @entity36 national team manager ) said in an interview that @entity192 or i can be captain also			1
i said that would be a big honour for me one day to be captain of @entity36 with my colour			1
’ he is aware of the roles @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 have played in establishing the leadership credentials of black players in western @entity203 by captaining @entity204			2
‘ they are good role models , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity208 also ; ( @entity207 ) @entity206 was captain			2
so for me it would be a great honour to be captain			2
’ because it would send a message ? ‘ to all @entity36 and the world			1
maybe they look on @entity36 and say it ’s mixed but it ’s not possible they have a black captain			1
’ @entity0 is an impressive figure both in terms of height — he ’s 6ft 4in — and his manner			1
the failure of @entity39 to integrate him at the club remains a puzzle to outsiders			1
my girlfriend was pregnant , we wanted her to stay in @entity36 and have the baby there			1
then i started with a knee injury			0
the coach promised that i ’d play central defence — but i played right , i played left			0
@entity0 struggled to settle at the @entity233 after being played out of position on the right side of defence the 26 - year - old did not have to think twice about leaving @entity238 after @entity34 came in for him @entity0 's half - brother @entity137 chose to represent @entity140 instead of @entity36 at international level ‘ then i had another knee injury , i had an operation also , so i was not happy with the whole situation			1
‘ but i learned so much , even in training , from the players there			0
that ’s why i made the move — @entity206 , @entity248 , ( @entity250 ) @entity249 , ( @entity251 ) @entity252 at this time — they are all great players			0
so i learned a lot about myself also and they gave me good advice and that ’s why i say i ’m not sad that i went to @entity238			0
’ having been at @entity39 , he appreciates the scale of the ambition at the club and their desire to win the @entity41 but he also knows that process is never as quick as winning a domestic league title			1
‘ it takes time because the @entity41 is difficult and it ’s different to the league and cup			1
one small mistake or one detail , it ’s finished			0
@entity39 have the opportunity , for sure , to win it			1
they have great players , there will be great players in the future			0
’ this group of players at @entity34 had to learn their lessons painfully and slowly , losing finals in 2010 and 2012 before finally winning at @entity277 in 2013			1
@entity0 ’s first season at the club included the bitter disappointment of losing the final to @entity282 on penalties in their own stadium			1
‘ even though they did n’t deserve it ! ’ he says , laughing			0
‘ no , ’ he adds , correcting himself			0
if we do n’t take it , they deserve it			0
that was the worst feeling in my life , really			0
i could n’t eat for two days			0
’ a young @entity0 plays for @entity36 against @entity292 in the @entity293 in 2007 the defender makes a tackle on future team - mate @entity175 while playing for @entity65 @entity34 's loss to @entity282 in the 2012 @entity41 final spurred them on to win it the next year at that stage @entity300 , @entity175 , @entity0 and team - mates were caricatured in @entity36 as serial losers with club and country ; always the nearly men			1
‘ i remember the day after the @entity282 final @entity308 sent a message , not only to me but to a couple of players , saying : “ look — this happened			0
but next year we take this cup			2
ok ! ” ‘ when you come to a final you remember that message and that you have to take the chance			0
it ’s not every day you go into a final			0
’ though these days it feels as though @entity0 has made cup final appearances a pretty regular feature of his life			1
and , you suspect his teams , both @entity34 and @entity36 , will have plenty more ahead of them .			1
