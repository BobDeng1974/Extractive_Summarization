the franchises have to want them ! plenty have tried & failed to get a go ! ' but , the encouraging news is that the new boss has the vision to look to open up a window to hopefully give players a better chance ! ' i really do think changes are going to be made & positive things are going to start to happen for the good of @entity86 cricket ... ' @entity1 's @entity47 embarrassment has given ammunition to those who believe it was a mistake to axe @entity2 and while @entity19 ' comments have forced the @entity1 to reinforce their stance on a player who left @entity94 last autumn , @entity0 said it has not caused him any discomfort			1
' what @entity19 said was absolutely right , ' he said			0
' to be picked for @entity1 you have to be scoring an awful amount of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors as a positive influence on the side			0
