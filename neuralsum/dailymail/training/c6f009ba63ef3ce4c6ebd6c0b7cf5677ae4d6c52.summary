however , adviser @entity10 , now @entity12 's policy chief , helped to convince @entity2 to use @entity13 as a ' trailblazer ' for the new tax which replaced the old domestic rates based on property values			1
mrs @entity2 's chancellor @entity1 warned the poll tax would be ' completely unworkable and politically catastrophic ' in a strongly worded memo , mr @entity1 said : ' a flat - rate poll tax would be politically unsustainable ; even with a rebate scheme the package would have an unacceptable impact on certain types of household			1
' he wrote of the ' horrifying ' impact as ' a pensioner couple in @entity28 could find themselves paying 22 per cent of their net income in poll tax , whereas a better off couple in the suburbs pay only 1 per cent			2
' mr @entity1 continued : ' the biggest gainers would be better off households in high rateable value properties ; the losers would be poorer households , particularly larger ones			0
' we should be forced to give so many exemptions and concessions ( inevitably to the benefit of high spending authorities in @entity28 ) that the flat - rate poll tax would rapidly become a surrogate income tax			2
' mrs @entity2 was urged to use @entity13 as a ' trailblazer ' for the new tax in the teeth of the opposition of senior colleagues the introduction of the community charge , as it was officially known , in @entity13 in 1989 and the following year in @entity52 and @entity53 , provoked riots and protests across the country even environment minister @entity59 , the scheme 's architect , was beginning to have doubts , proposing a watered - down alternative combining the flat - tax levy with elements of a property charge			1

the community charge , as it was officially known , was introduced in @entity13 in 1989 and the following year in @entity52 and @entity53			0
it proved to be a disaster for the @entity74 , provoking riots and protests across the country and helping to precipitate mrs @entity2 's final downfall			0
however , papers released by the @entity79 in @entity80 , west @entity28 , show that mr @entity10 helped to convince @entity2 to use @entity13 as a ' trailblazer ' for the new tax in the teeth of the opposition of senior colleagues			1
the introduction of the community charge , as it was officially known , in @entity13 in 1989 and the following year in @entity52 and @entity53 , provoked riots and protests across the country and eventually led to mrs @entity2 's final downfall			2
@entity10 , who is now @entity12 's policy chief , worked as an adviser in @entity92 in the 1980s and urged @entity2 to press ahead with the introduction of the poll tax in @entity13 the seeds of the debacle were sown four years earlier in 1985 , when she was persuaded by environment ministers @entity59 and @entity98 that she could realise her long - held ambition to abolish the old domestic rates - based on property values - through a new , flat - rate tax payable by all adults			1
in 1985 mr @entity10 told the prime minister : ' no one can say that you are being insufficiently radical , since you will be ... trying out an extremely radical system in a significant part of the country			0
' by the same token , no one can accuse you of being rash , since you will be reserving your options on domestic rates in @entity52 and @entity53			0
' if you are not willing to move to a pure residence charge in @entity52 and @entity53 immediately , you should not introduce a mixture of taxes , but should rather use the @entity13 as a trailblazer for the real thing			0
