by @entity1 reporter published : 06:13 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 31 august 2012 a photographer found out it is seldom wise to cross a pelican			2
this huge great white pelican at @entity6 took exception to being photographed and lunged forward to peck @entity9 's camera			1
fortunately @entity9 was able to step back and prevent his lens disappearing into the vast abyss formed by the pelican 's beak and the mouth opening - which is normally the last thing seen by fish , the bird 's usual diet , as they are swallowed whole			1
cross pelican : the huge great white pelican lunged for the photographer 's camera at @entity6 the pelican lives at an area of @entity6 called ' swamp ' , accompanied by more pelicans and also cormorants			1
the great white pelican is know as the @entity13 in @entity30 due to the rosy hue of its feathers @entity9 said : ' it was really fun to make these shots as this pelican seemed to decide my camera was some kind of food suitable for pelicans and tried to peck it			1
' it was even a bit scary because this is actually a big bird and weighs pretty much			0
' but despite my fear i coped to make a couple of shots and i am satisfied with the result as these photos look funny			0
' the great white pelican is a huge bird , with only the dalmatian pelican averaging larger amongst pelicans			1
the bird 's wingspan can measure from 226 to 360 cm ( 7.41 to 11.8 ft ) , with the latter measurement the largest recorded among extant flying animals outside of great albatrosses			0
its enormous bill comprises 28.9 to 47.1 cm ( 11.4 to 18.5 in ) of that length			0
adult males , weigh from 9 to 15 kg ( 20 to 33 lb ) , though large races from the @entity66 are usually around 11 kg ( 24 lb ) with few exceeding 13 kg ( 29 lb )			0
camera shy : the pelican took exception to being snapped by a photographer at @entity6 in @entity30 open wide : the pelican demonstrated the full scale of its enormous beak for photographer @entity9 no pictures please : the great white pelican opened its beak as though to swallow the camera whole jaw - dropping : photographer @entity9 said he just managed to avoid losing his camera down the throat of the irate bird the great white pelican is well adapted for aquatic life			1
the short strong legs and webbed feet propel it in water and aid the bird 's rather awkward takeoff from the water surface			0
once aloft , the long - winged pelicans are powerful fliers , and often travel in spectacular v - formation groups			0
great white pelicans are usually found in and around shallow , warm , fresh water			2
in @entity97 , great white pelicans occur mainly around freshwater and alkaline lakes and may also be found in coastal , estuarine areas .			2

great white pelican did not take kindly to being photographed at @entity6
