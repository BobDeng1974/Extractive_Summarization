@entity7 in general do prefer cheaper wines , according to taste tests			1
eight out of ten people in the blind test preferred a bottle of wine costing £ 4.99 to a £ 19.99 option made from the same grapes			1
and six in ten thought the £ 4.99 version was the more expensive of the two			2
battle of the bottles : eight out of 10 people preferred the £ 4.99 bottle of @entity22 , left , compared to the £ 19.99 bottle of @entity24 , right , in the blind taste tests carried out by the @entity26 the figures , from the @entity26 , are sure to challenge conventions about what makes a really good bottle of wine			1
the academy insists the £ 19.99 bottle is superior and that it takes some knowledge , tasting and experience to understand why			1
however , the ordinary consumer might well argue that personal taste is a better judge , while the cheaper option is also more gentle on the pocket			2
@entity41 was gathered from 20,000 enthusiasts attending courses at the academy over 20 years			1
each workshop opened with a blind tasting of two wines from the same grape variety at different prices			1
without any instructions on how to taste or what to look for the drinkers were asked to rate the wine on taste and guess the price			0

cheaper wines from warm climates have lower acidity , higher alcohol content , and have a more simple flavour			0
experts , however , look for complex flavours , the balance between them and how long flavours linger , said academy founder @entity85			0
she added : ‘ the better , and usually more expensive the wine , the longer this finish will be			0
the flavours of a £ 4.99 wine may last for less than 10 seconds whilst a £ 19.99 wine should linger for nearly a minute			1
’ miss @entity85 said that more expensive wines were not necessarily ‘ better ’ than cheaper ones , they were just ‘ different ’ and often needed food to fully bring out the flavour			2
‘ initially our students prefer the simplicity of less expensive wines , ’ she said			2
‘ but as their understanding and sense of taste grow they tend to gravitate to pricier wines that display more complexity			0
’ she said that , contrary to popular belief , no one is born with a good or bad palate and like any discipline tasting is about teaching your body to do new and unfamiliar things			0
‘ wine tasting is about developing the lines of communication between your nose , tongue and brain and in novice tasters these lines are relatively underdeveloped , ’ she said .			0
