ms @entity2 , who is likely to have been the first girl from the area to attend university , embarked on the study of her village in 1905 after returning from the @entity5			1
but her no - holds - barred report - in which local children are described as ' rascals ' , ' slow ' , or ' lazy ' - caused outrage in @entity16			2
villagers , fearing their identity would be revealed and their secrets laid bare , lobbied the parish council in a bid to have ms @entity2 ' paper withdrawn before it was sent to be published			1
now , exactly 100 years after the sociologist 's death , local historian @entity49 has printed her forgotten paper for all to read			2
he said : ' the trouble was that , although she did not name them individually , they found it easy to identify who she was describing			2
' her frank comments about their drinking habits and moral lapses did not go down well			0
the parish council tried to suppress and have it withdrawn			2
' ms @entity2 returned to @entity16 in 1905 to embark on an in - depth investigation into the daily lives of ordinary villagers , and was allowed into homes to record every detail of their day - to - day survival			1

the resulting book , ' life in an @entity141 ' , took @entity2 more than five years to complete and even includes an hourly census of the numbers and types of people in the village 's six pubs over a period mr @entity49 , from @entity148 , stumbled across the book in the 1970s while running a library in @entity17			1
