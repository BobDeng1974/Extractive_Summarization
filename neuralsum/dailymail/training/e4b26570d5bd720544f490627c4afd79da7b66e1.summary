@entity0 published : 19:39 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 23 september 2013 health anxiety : like many women worried about their health , @entity0 turned to alternative medicine several months ago , i started feeling unusually tired			1
walking to the shops felt like wading through treacle , and i would wake every morning with splitting headaches and stomach pains			1
i got every cough and cold going and the glands in my throat were like golf balls			2
i could n't seem to shake off anything and the symptoms went on for more than six weeks			2
like many women worried about their health , i turned to alternative medicine - something i had never done before			2
a few years ago , i would have dismissed alternative remedies as useless , but i was swayed by friends who swore by their nutritionists ( and , i admit , celebrity endorsements )			2
i typed my symptoms into @entity23 and many websites sprung up suggesting i had leaky gut syndrome and candida			2
' leaky gut ' , i read , is caused by a build - up of toxins - including environmental pollutants , chemicals and harmful effects from things such as coffee , alcohol and sugar - as a result of my liver not working at its optimum			1
apparently the small intestines become inflamed and irritated , which allows these toxins to enter the bloodstream			2
the immune system reacts to this , and becomes overloaded , leading to symptoms including infections , tiredness and headaches			1
@entity49 is a yeast that can destroy gut flora ( good bacteria ) and allow bad bacteria and viruses to exist in the gut			2
good bacteria is destroyed by a diet high in sugar , alcohol and antibiotics			2
what the websites suggested was a liver cleanse for the leaky gut ( detoxing the liver to enable it to work properly ) and taking a host of supplements and herbal remedies to improve my health and immune system and tackle the candida			1
liver cleanses have become increasingly popular as more celebrities embark on weird and wonderful diets and cleanses to detox their system			1
i did half question if this could work , but felt so ill i was willing to try anything			1
and the sites seemed so convincing and dressed it all up in medical language , so i did n't think of going to a doctor			2
i 'd become slightly disillusioned by the @entity81 as it always took so long to get an appointment , but this seemed quick and easy			2
getting healthy this way is certainly not cheap			2
as i loaded my basket with nutritional supplements and liquids , i was shocked how expensive they were , ranging from £ 8 to £ 35 for a bottle of pills			0
there was l - glutamine , an amino acid designed to repair the intestinal wall ; acidophilus pills ( probiotics ) to keep the gut flora healthy ; liver ' support ' tablets such as l - orinthine - a non-essential amino acid said to help regenerate the liver and aid the immune system ; and milk thistle , a flowering @entity107 herb used to treat liver problems			1
disgusting : @entity0 's @entity110 liver detox mixture tasted so horrible , she nearly threw up @entity49 tablets and oregano oil capsules to get rid of fungus in the gut were also among my purchases			1
for the liver cleanse the choice ranged from pre-packaged versions with herbal pills , to more extreme ones using @entity122 salts			1
i opted for the extreme version as it was cheaper , which consisted of @entity122 ' cocktails ' and concoctions of olive oil and grapefruit juice			0
the @entity122 salts apparently detoxify and act as a laxative , while the olive oil and grapefruit juice help detox			0
i bought these in a diy kit , costing £ 10 in total			0
i started on a saturday at 5pm , after fasting all day and drinking only apple juice the day before , as recommended			0
i also swore off coffee and sugar , and refined carbohydrates , cheese and red meat , as recommended by the websites			0
i took the first dose of @entity122 salts and the olive oil and grapefruit juice			0
the mixture tasted so disgusting i nearly threw up , but i still continued with the second dose two hours later			0
that night , my stomach was gripped with pain			0
by 3am i could not move from the bathroom , and woke feeling wretched and my head was spinning			0
liver cleanses vary , but with mine i could introduce juices and fruit after a day and a half			1
by the third day , although the liver cleanse was over and i 'd started my supplements , i still felt unwell			1
i drank gallons of dandelion tea as recommended , which did me no good			0
the worst thing was the headaches and crashing fatigue that had taken over			1
by day four , i was also shivering and my muscles ached			0
i was convinced i had flu			0
i could n't get up without feeling dizzy , and although i was managing a few smoothies , anything i ate made me more nauseous			0
i stayed in bed , drinking water			0
after six days the worst was over , and although i gradually upped my food intake to include vegetables , chicken and brown rice as suggested , the headaches , fatigue and sore throat continued			1
finally , two weeks after starting the cleanse i threw my supplements away and went to see a doctor			1
he sent me for blood tests and prescribed medication to help calm the stomach			0
' i took the first dose of @entity122 salts and the olive oil and grapefruit juice			0
the mixture tasted so disgusting i nearly threw up , but i still continued with the second dose two hours later			0
' the test results showed i had low lymphocytes			0
these make up about 38 per cent of white blood cells , and are responsible for immune function - making my low count likely to be behind my initial fatigue and ill health			1
my extreme and sudden symptoms , however , were the result of the liver cleanse - giving up coffee , sugar and going on a near - starvation diet did n't help			1
and not eating properly was completely the wrong thing for someone with a compromised immune system			0
my doctor said having low lymphocytes is not serious and is likely to have been caused by a viral infection			0
he advised me to rest , eat a balanced diet and take gentle exercise to help my immune system , and prescribed antibiotics as he said i had a chest infection			0
i will soon have more tests to see if it improves naturally , but if my count has dropped further , other treatments will be considered			0
but these wo n't include supplements , as @entity219 , a senior biochemical scientist at @entity220 , @entity221 , specialising in immunology , explains : ' no dietary condition causes low lymphocytes			0
these mean the immune system is not working and a specialist would be the next logical step			0
' bedridden : the liver cleanse gave @entity0 headaches , crashing fatigue and nausea it 's a salutary reminder about the pitfalls of self - diagnosis online			1
and as for a liver cleanse , the idea is a nonsense , says @entity239 , a nutritional scientist and a spokesperson for @entity241 , a charity that campaigns for science - backed treatment			1
' there is no evidence that demonstrates that the treatments and remedies available have any effect of decreasing toxins , ' she says			1
' the liver has specific enzymes that break down harmful toxins into harmless substances that are then secreted by the kidneys			1
' you can not influence the rate at which the liver produces enzymes or make them more efficient			1
the only way to optimise the liver is sensible lifestyle and eating habits			1
' limiting harmful substances such as alcohol and tobacco means the liver is n't overworked			1
i wish i had seen my doctor at first instead of spending £ 150 on useless supplements and detoxes			2
it 's been an expensive lesson .			2

@entity0 's liver cleanse gave her headaches , fatigue , aches , and nausea
after seeing her *gp* , she learned there is no evidence detoxes work
