auction : the best - selling author is to put her jewellery up for sale at @entity4 in december @entity5 is selling her jewellery collection to provide a nest egg for two distant relatives			1
the 80 - year - old author of @entity10 , who has no children , is auctioning diamond rings , ornate brooches , necklaces and bracelets – most of which were presents from her husband @entity18			1
she initially thought of giving the 40 - item collection , which is expected to raise almost £ 1.5million , to the two women , who are described as ‘ wider family members ’			1
but she came to the conclusion that the gems are not something they would want or wear ‘ as they do n’t lead the same lifestyle as me ’			2
a 14 - carat diamond ring has been valued at almost £ 500,000 and a pair of @entity31 diamond and pearl earrings is expected to fetch up to £ 75,000 in the sale at @entity4 in @entity34 on december 5			1
she explained that much of her jewellery remains in a drawer at her penthouse home in @entity37			1
she said : ‘ my father told me when i was a child , after he gave me a string of pearls : “ you must always let them breath			2
they should be out on your neck , not buried in a drawer			2
” ' why was all this buried in a drawer ? , well , i did n’t know			0
‘ then i realised i was going to leave that jewellery to two of our female heirs			1
they did n’t really want it , i do n’t think , because they do n’t really lead the kind of life that i lead as a well - known writer , and i ’m out and about			1
‘ @entity18 and i decided it might be nice to auction it and the money will be a little nest egg for them			1
let somebody else enjoy those beautiful things			0
’ miss @entity5 has said she does not want to disclose the identities of the two women , although it is possible they are descendants of her aunt @entity70 and uncle @entity71			1
a recent @entity75 programme , secrets from the @entity73 , showed the author extensively researching her family history , while she was also shocked to learn in 2004 that her mother , along with aunt and uncle , may have been the illegitimate children of the @entity82			1
a girl 's best friend : a cushion - shape diamond ring ( left ) could fetch up to £ 460,000 at auction , while a pair of old cut fancy yellow diamond single - stone earrings ( right ) could go for up to £ 66,000 @entity89 - born miss @entity5 , who has sold over 88 million books in more than 90 countries , said that most of the items were presents from her husband , a television producer with whom she celebrates her 50th wedding anniversary on christmas eve this year			1
‘ i happen to have a very generous husband , and he ’s really bought everything that is going on auction , ’ she added			2
‘ i did say : “ is that alright ? are you agreeing to this ? ” and he said “ yes , of course			0
i bought it , but i gave it to you and it ’s yours and you can do what you like with it ”			0
‘ when i look at those things and when i was going back in time , because we are coving the 80s and the 90s , a lot of the memories of how he gave the piece to me sprang in to my mind			0
' i was very amused and very happy because i remember once for instance we were in vacation in @entity120 and i was reading on the terrace after breakfast and he said : “ i ’m just going for a walk to buy a newspaper ”			0
antique : a cushion - shape sapphire ring ( left ) is expected to fetch up to £ 131,000			1

and then he suddenly reached in to the shopping bag and said : “ i ’ve bought you some flowers ”			0
flowers indeed ! @entity137 , multi-coloured flowers in a necklace			0
he does things like that all the time			0
‘ it ’s a wrench , but at the same time i ’ve enjoyed those pieces and i ’d had them for years and a lot of times they had remained in the safe			0
so , when you ’ve owned beautiful things , and i still have quite a few beautiful things left , they should be in a safe			0
they should be being worn by another person , another woman			0
‘ the husband should be buying it for her			0
i do n’t believe in buying your own jewellery if you ’re a woman			2
’ miss @entity5 and her husband have never had children			1

i would have liked a child ; i did n’t have one			0
what am i going to do ? i ’ve got @entity18			0
