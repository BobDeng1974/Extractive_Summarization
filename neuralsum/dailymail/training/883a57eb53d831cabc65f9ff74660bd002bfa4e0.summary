when @entity1 led @entity2 to a @entity4 semi-final playing three at the back and declared he would use the same system at @entity8 it appeared we could be on the cusp of a tactical revolution in this country			1
shortly after though @entity13 , like @entity14 at @entity15 and a few other managers at clubs in the @entity18 , had quickly abandoned the back three and returned to systems traditionally more tried and trusted on these shores			0
one place the back three is still going strong though is not in the aforementioned footballing heartlands of @entity25 and @entity26 , but down in @entity27			0
at @entity28 , to be precise			0
@entity29 issues instructions to @entity31 during saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity33 @entity1 used three at the back with plenty of success at the @entity4 with @entity2 the opening day of the season saw @entity41 welcome @entity39 to @entity42			1
it was supposed to be the confirmation of pre-season predictions that @entity47 's blades would canter to the @entity49 title , but @entity29 had n't read the script			1
@entity29 surprised his opposite number with a 3 - 4 - 3 system , silencing the home crowd early on by flooding players forward and eventually running out 2 - 1 winners			2
@entity39 have not looked back since			2
three months on , still employing a system similar to those abandoned by @entity13 and @entity14 , and @entity29 's side remain unbeaten in @entity49			1
saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity33 at @entity28 was their 10th victory in @entity49 season			1
if he is being picky , six draws is probably more than @entity29 will have liked , but his side do not lack adventure - they are the top scorers in the division with 33 goals already			2
@entity68 goes head over heels after scoring the @entity71 ' winner at @entity28 on saturday that 's quite some feat when you consider they lost @entity49 's top scorer last season , @entity77 , to @entity78 in august			2
the 23 goals lost with @entity77 's departure look like they will be more than compensated for by the attacking trio of @entity68 , @entity82 and @entity83 - all signed in the summer			0
in @entity29 's system , @entity82 is the target man with the pace of @entity68 and the guile of @entity83 providing further goal threats coming from wide and deep			2
between the three of them they have scored 17 in the league already this season			0
@entity39 have been lucky with injuries so far			0
@entity29 has had to make very few changes to his starting line - up and with a small squad to choose from he 'll need that luck to remain if they are to keep up this relentless form			0
@entity29 's side are still unbeaten in @entity49 three months and 16 games in to the season excluding @entity77 , @entity29 has only used 17 players in the league but he does have some nous in reserve to call upon			1
defender @entity107 , winger @entity108 and forward @entity109 have not been regular starters but all have @entity113 experience			0
the key will be if those players can slot quickly in to @entity29 's system and one suspects , given how well prepared @entity39 were on that opening day to play three at the back , they might just do so			1
it is refreshing to see genuine innovation in the lower leagues , and with it a real gamble paying off			0
the tactical success of @entity2 and @entity126 at the @entity4 may not have had the impact expected by some on the top flight , but it 's influencing things in the third tier			1
good week for ... @entity132			2
after failing to win any of his first three games at the club , @entity133 has masterminded a seven - match unbeaten run			0
saturday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity141 leaves the @entity142 just six points off the @entity113 play - off places and , more importantly , eight points clear of the relegation zone			2
@entity145 ( second left ) celebrates after scoring in @entity132 's 3 - 0 win over @entity141 bad week for ... @entity147			1
having won eight on the spin in @entity49 , @entity150 's side headed into saturday 's trip to @entity152 full of confidence			1
it came as a huge surprise to all , then , when they were seen off rather easily in a 3 - 0 defeat to dent their automatic promotion hopes			0
talent scout : @entity161 ( @entity162 ) a recent @entity18 column highlighted the number of young talents coming through at @entity166 and @entity161 is another one , albeit it he is out on loan at @entity162			1
the 20 - year - old striker , given his debut by @entity172 in the 2011 - 12 season , netted in a 3 - 0 win over @entity175 on saturday			0
he is still highly thought of at the @entity176 despite being sent out on loan			0
@entity161 scores @entity162 's second goal in their 3 - 0 victory over @entity175 on saturday			1

@entity39 top of @entity49 and unbeaten after 16 games
@entity29 playing three at the back as @entity2 did at the @entity4
good week for @entity187 , beating @entity141
bad week for @entity189 , losing at @entity152
talent scout *focuses* on @entity162 's on - loan @entity166 striker @entity161
