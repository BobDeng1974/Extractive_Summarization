@entity54 , creator of ' @entity55 , ' ' scandal , ' and ' how to @entity57 , ' was one of the many in @entity26 to lash out about the article on @entity60 ' @entity10 and i apologize deeply and sincerely to those who ’ve been hurt by this			1

' our writers , and editors , can be so focused on the trees they sometimes forget to look at the forest , or in this case , the readers who are much more than statistics			0
' a perfect storm of events left us vulnerable , including me choosing the worst time to be zonked from a 22 - hour return flight from @entity144 , and normally smart editors on duty failing to respond decisively even after a torrent of hostile comments rolled in , ' @entity40 said			2

her actions felt like panicked damage control to me ; we decided to face the consequences and take our lumps			0
