@entity0 has embraced @entity2 ’s return to @entity3 and made it his aim to ensure this is the start of prolonged spell on the big stage			1
it is five years since @entity2 last played in the @entity10 - they were knocked out by @entity11 in february 2010 - but , unlike some managers , @entity0 is relishing the prospects of having a thursday - sunday schedule for the first half of the campaign			1
@entity0 sees @entity18 football as being crucial to the development of his squad and while he believes they face a ‘ phenomenal challenge ’ against @entity23 at @entity24 on thursday evening , he is confident they can handle the demands			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 wants the club to be playing in @entity3 for many seasons to come reaching the knockout stages is a prime objective for @entity0 but he is also looking at the bigger picture			1
@entity2 had a spell of qualifying for @entity3 four times in five seasons under @entity36 but , prior to that , there had only been one campaign since the 1980s			1
that is why @entity0 believes it is essential @entity2 maintain their place in the @entity47 ’s top six so that nights like the one that beckons against @entity23 are not something out of the ordinary			1
‘ our fans know we are not going to stand still , ’ said @entity0			1
’ we are trying to be successful today but having a clear target of where we want to get to			0
we want to be a football club that replicates the glories in the past			2
@entity2 have been training ahead of their @entity10 group opener at home to @entity23 on thursday ‘ that does n’t just happen on the pitch there are a lot of aspects which need to come together			1
on the pitch and the mentality you develop we want to put the demand on being in @entity3 every season that is a goal			1
‘ it is not easy because there are another eight or nine teams in the @entity47 who have the same mentality and are spending money to achieve that			0
the competition is there for that , but we want to get back to how it was in the 60s and 80s here in the years ahead			0
‘ i get satisfaction from how good we can be as a team and part of that process is how good we can be in @entity3			2
we need @entity3 for us to be as good as we can be			2
the potential in the squad is incredible			0
the next step is to be facing @entity18 sides and that is what we need to progress			0
’ @entity2 captain @entity91 admits he would like to three cups with the club before he retires @entity91 , @entity2 ’s captain , has bittersweet memories of @entity2 ’s last @entity18 campaign , as he made his return from a cruciate ligament problem in their final game against @entity11			1
he has experienced highs and lows in the @entity10 but he has missed being out of it			2
‘ i ’ve just turned 32 , so the number of times i ’m going to get into cup competitions is drastically coming down , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m desperate to finish as high up as we can in the @entity47 and also win a cup , two cups or three cups			0
these are the competitions you go into			0
‘ you tune into the latter stages of the @entity10 and you see the teams involved , why would you not want to be one of those teams ? we ’re desperate to do as well as we can			2
we put a lot of faith in the manager picking the right team			0
we have full confidence in him .			0
