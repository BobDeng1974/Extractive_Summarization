i could n’t tell you who we were playing or what the score was			0
i do n’t think anyone was interested after that			0
‘ i do remember she was very tall and beautiful and wearing tight trousers and all the lads were all looking , thinking : “ how the hell did she get into those ? ” ‘ she walked out with @entity21 and she was waving and shouting to @entity60 and he ’s going : “ do me a favour , leave it out , i ’m playing here ”			2

if i had been @entity83 i would have slipped her my number but then again if i was @entity83 she would have slipped me hers			0
‘ i do n’t think she really understood football because when she left , the game had kicked off and she walked down the touchline next to the dog track to a cacophony of wolf - whistles and cries of “ get ‘ em off ! ” then the crowd joined in			2
‘ she saw me , waved and shouted to get my attention , “ @entity95 , @entity60 , bye - bye @entity60 ”			0
’ @entity44 is sure she did n’t visit the dressing room and she did n’t attend the ‘ tea - room ’ where many of the a-list celebrities would go for post-match refreshment and where , according to legend , @entity105 secretary of state @entity103 was once spotted among the likes of @entity108 and @entity109			2

‘ we were shooting in the middle of the desert but i managed to convince @entity12 to put on a @entity0 strip for a kickabout on the wild west set , ’ says @entity122			1

‘ wow ! this was better than i expected - sensational stuff			0

even compared with today when @entity192 and @entity193 turn up , this will go down as @entity0 ’s real @entity73 period			1
there were impromptu visits from film stars @entity197 and @entity199 , usually accompanied by lifelong @entity0 fan and future club president @entity201 , and time spent hanging out in cafes after training with @entity204 and @entity205 , or ‘ @entity206 from @entity207 ’ , as he was known to the players at the time			2
