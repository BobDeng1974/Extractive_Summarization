an effective moratorium on new onshore wind farms will be in place within six months of a @entity5 election victory next year , the party will pledge today			1
energy minister @entity6 will say that there is ‘ no requirement for any more ’ of the turbines erected across the country with little or no regard for the views of local communities			1
the conservative manifesto will also pledge to scrap the subsidies paid by bill - payers for onshore wind power and change the planning system to allow local councils to block any which do not already have planning consent			2

the @entity5 will pledge today that an effective moratorium on new onshore wind farms will be in place within six months of a @entity5 election victory next year pledge : energy minister @entity6 will say that there is ' no requirement for any more ' of the turbines erected across the country with little or no regard for the views of local communities the key reforms would be implemented six months after a majority @entity5 government is elected , mr @entity6 is expected to say			1
the move represents a major concession by @entity39 – who once urged voters to ‘ vote blue , go green ’ and erected a turbine on the roof of his house – to sceptical @entity5 mps			1
the @entity47 have gradually lost their enthusiasm for green policies since 2006			2
‘ vote blue , go green			1
we have to think global , act local ’ @entity5 manifesto , april 2006 ‘ we are not going to drop the environmental agenda			1
we will take forward our green agenda in a way that strengthens the economy – not “ green ” or “ growth ” , but both ’ @entity39 , june 2008 ‘ i want us to be the greenest government ever – a very simple ambition and one that i ’m absolutely committed to achieving ’ mr @entity39 , may 2010 ‘ onshore wind plays a role in a balanced @entity61 electricity mix , alongside gas , nuclear , cleaner coal and other forms of renewable energy			1
i am also determined that we seize the economic opportunities in renewable energy supply chains ’ mr @entity39 , feb 2012 ‘ we can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities			2
i ca n’t single - handedly build a new @entity72 but i can protect our green and pleasant land ’ former @entity5 energy minister @entity74 , oct 2012 ‘ there ’s a limited potential for onshore wind			1
frankly , we ’ve got some in the @entity61 – i do n’t think we ’re going to have a huge amount more ’ mr @entity39 , aug 2013 ‘ get rid of all the green c * * p ’ mr @entity39 , reportedly , to aides , nov 2013 ‘ @entity84 climate change worship has damaged @entity61 industry and put up bills ’ @entity5 energy minister @entity6 , feb 2014 ‘ wind farms have a place – and it is offshore by and large			1
they work better in the sea because it ’s windier , so they do n’t have to blight the landscape ’ @entity5 chairman @entity93 , april 2014 the prime minister has been persuaded that @entity61 can meet targets for increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind farms through those that have already been built and those with planning consent			1
the 4,000 existing onshore wind turbines , which have enjoyed generous subsidies for 20 years , deliver power to four million homes			0
a further 3,000 , for which planning permission has been given , will deliver power to three million more by 2020			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ making sure we have a good mixture of reliable energy is an important part of our long - term economic plan			0
‘ we remain committed to cutting our carbon emissions – and renewable energy , including onshore wind , has a key role in our future energy supply			0
' but we now have enough billpayer - funded onshore wind in the pipeline to meet our renewable energy commitments			0
‘ that ’s why the next @entity5 government will end any additional billpayer subsidy for onshore wind , and give local councils the decisive say on any new wind farms			1
’ a government source said that a majority @entity5 government would ‘ effectively curtail further large - scale onshore wind developments ’ , adding : ‘ if elected , we would make these changes within the first six months			1
’ as well as ending subsidies , which mean wind farm owners are paid nearly double the going rate for every unit of energy they generate for the @entity141 , legislation would be introduced to reform applications for new developments			0
applications for new wind farms have to be made to local authorities , and around a half are refused			0
but under the existing system , energy firms often win on appeal to the government ’s planning inspectorate			2
the @entity47 say the entire process would be handled by councils through a locally - led planning system , not a national regime which prioritises ‘ significant infrastructure ’ projects as at present			0
the party will also pledge to ensure that concerns about the impact of projects on landscapes and heritage sites can not be overturned except in exceptional circumstances			0
the party ’s shift in policy appears timed with next month ’s local elections in mind , given the controversy generated by wind turbines in many areas			0
it opens up a significant dividing line for the conservatives with @entity176 and the @entity177 , who enthusiastically support more wind power			0
@entity180 told the @entity181 that @entity61 would have to ‘ embrace ’ onshore wind if @entity176 wins next year			2
prime minister : the move represents a major concession by @entity39 - who once urged voters to ' vote blue , go green ' and erected a turbine on the roof of his house - to sceptical @entity5 mps last night @entity177 , the @entity177 energy secretary , said : ‘ i know what our @entity192 policy is : it is to invest in renewables , to invest in low carbon , and onshore wind is a major part of that investment			1
‘ onshore wind is the cheapest form of renewable electricity , and if you were to not go ahead with that investment you would see people ’s bills go up			0
’ @entity61 must invest £ 33billion in infrastructure if the country is to make the most of its shale gas reserves , says a study today			0
commissioned by the @entity61 @entity213 which represents fracking firms , it estimates that 4,000 wells will be drilled over 18 years			2
@entity216 claimed the report was ‘ rose - tinted industry guess - timates ’ and ‘ a veiled plea for government and taxpayer support ’ .			2
