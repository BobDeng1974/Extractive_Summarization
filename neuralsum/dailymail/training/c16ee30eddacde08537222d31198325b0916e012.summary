scientists have created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe			2
this new virtual cosmos , designed by @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 researchers , comes complete with twisting galaxies , exploding gas clouds and mysterious black holes			0
called @entity12 , the numerical - based model covers the 13 billion - year evolution of the universe beginning just 12 million years after the @entity16			1
. pictured is the cosmic web from 1 to 4 billion years after the @entity16 the simulation , which accurately depicts the distribution and composition of various types of galaxies , was developed by a team led by astrophysicist @entity28 of @entity29			1
it covers cosmic evolution in a cube with a side length 350 million light - years with unprecedented resolution			1
‘ until now , no single simulation was able to reproduce the universe on both large and small scales simultaneously , ’ said professor @entity28			1
previous attempts to simulate the universe were hampered by lack of computing power and the complexities of the underlying physics			0
the model recreates structures like galaxy clusters and the bubbles and voids of the cosmic web			1

the new computer simulation has reproduced features such as galaxy distribution and composition more accurately than previous models the simulation covers cosmic evolution in a cube with a side length 350 million light - years with unprecedented resolution			1

the numerical model covers the 13 - billion - year evolution of the universe beginning just 12 - million years after the @entity16			1
the @entity12 creators say it represents ' a significant step forward in modelling galaxy formation			2
' they attribute its success to advanced computer power			0
the team dedicated five years to developing the @entity12 program			2
the actual calculations took 3 months of ‘ run time , ’ using a total of 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel			1
as a result those programs either were limited in resolution , or forced to focus on a small portion of the universe			0
earlier simulations also had trouble modelling complex feedback from star formation , supernova explosions , and supermassive black holes			0

the actual calculations took 3 months of ‘ run time , ’ using a total of 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel			1
if they had used an average desktop computer , the calculations would have taken more than 2,000 years to complete			0
the computer simulation began a mere 12 million years after the @entity16			1
when it reached the present day , astronomers counted more than 41,000 galaxies in the cube of simulated space			0
importantly , @entity113 yielded a realistic mix of spiral galaxies like the @entity116 and football - shaped elliptical galaxies			0
it also recreated large - scale structures like galaxy clusters and the bubbles and voids of the cosmic web			1
on the small scale , it accurately recreated the chemistries of individual galaxies			2
since light travels at a fixed speed , the farther away astronomers look , the farther back in time they can see			0
a galaxy one billion light - years away is seen as it was a billion years ago			0
telescopes like @entity134 can give us views of the early universe by looking to greater distances			0
however , astronomers ca n't use @entity134 to follow the evolution of a single galaxy over time			0
‘ @entity12 is like a time machine			2
we can go forward and backward in time , ’ said co-author @entity142			0
‘ we can pause the simulation and zoom into a single galaxy or galaxy cluster to see what 's really going on			0

this image shows light distribution of a massive cluster of galaxies pictured are a cluster of galaxies			0
previous attempts have broadly reproduced the web of galaxies , but failed to create mixed populations of galaxies or predict gas and metal content			0

@entity12 was developed over 5 years by a team led by @entity28 of @entity29

it recreates galaxy clusters , bubbles and voids of the cosmic web . on the small scale , it can recreate galaxies
