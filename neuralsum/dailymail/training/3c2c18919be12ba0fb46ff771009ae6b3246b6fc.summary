the leader of the @entity1 has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven			1
speaking at his weekly address in the @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity6 confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends , along with ' all of @entity16 's creatures			1
' the head of the @entity1 had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog , according to @entity21			1
pope @entity6 confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and ' all of @entity16 's creatures ' during his weekly address in the @entity9 's @entity8 the statement is at odds with conservative @entity1 theology which states that animals can not go to heaven because they have no souls			1
@entity6 was quoted by @entity32 news media as saying : ' one day , we will see our animals again in the eternity of @entity36			0
@entity37 is open to all of @entity16 's creatures			1
' the remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as @entity40 and the @entity41			1
the issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries			0
pet owners will welcome the @entity6 's remarks that their beloved dogs , cats , horses and other furry friends have a place in heaven pope @entity6 has refused to meet the @entity55 over fears it could impact on the @entity1 's relationship with @entity59			2
the exiled @entity61 leader requested the meeting during a visit to @entity64 but it was declined ' for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation ' with @entity59			2
the @entity1 in @entity59 is divided in two ; the official church overseen by the @entity69 , and an underground community that swears allegiance to the @entity6			2
but the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops			0
a @entity9 official said the @entity6 's decision was ' not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered '			0
the longest serving @entity6 - @entity83 - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife			0
pope @entity6 's predecessor , pope @entity88 , had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on @entity97 but it is perhaps unsurprising that @entity6 , aged 77 , supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from @entity103 , the patron saint of animals			2
it 's not the first time @entity6 , an @entity107 who took over from @entity6 @entity88 last year , has courted controversy			0
