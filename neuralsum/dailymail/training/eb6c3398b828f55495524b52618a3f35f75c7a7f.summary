by @entity0 last updated at 5:53 pm on 21st october 2011 the @entity1 was forced to defend its ' ludicrous ' staffing levels at @entity3 after it was accused of outnumbering travellers and activists on the site towards the end of the protest			1
as the resistance at the travellers site , near @entity12 in @entity13 , ended with a mass exodus yesterday , the @entity9 was criticised for having more journalists and technical crews on site than there were remaining protesters			1
travellers escorted their extremist supporters to the exit gates before themselves leaving the illegal site in a convoy of vans and caravans			2
the @entity1 was accused of having about 30 staff on site - including television crews , local correspondents and documentary makers - despite the numbers of travellers and demonstrators dwindling , it was reported			1
a caravan being rented by the @entity1 at the @entity3 site			1
after first denying the @entity9 had hired the vehicle , a spokesman confirmed it was being used as a toilet part of the letter posted in the window of the caravan			1
a @entity1 spokesman said it was there because there were no toilet facilities on site there were also comments from the @entity1 's rivals on @entity53 , with @entity56 reporter @entity55 tweeting : ' we have a tent , the @entity1 has a caravan at @entity3			1
' earlier today a spokesman for the @entity1 denied the @entity9 rented a caravan for the eviction coverage , stating the only vehicles used were two satellite trucks and two radio trucks for broadcasts and a power supply			1
however , photographs have since emerged of a caravan with a sign in the window reading : ' this was rented by @entity74 for coverage of the @entity3 eviction			1
it should not be removed from the site			0
' it was signed by the news producer			0
when told about the picture , the @entity1 spokesman then said there had been a ' misunderstanding ' and admitted the caravan had been rented for toilet facilities because ' there were n't any on site '			1
he added : ' or it could have been there for power supply			0
' @entity9 said the actual number of staff on site - 24 - had been justified and added its news gathering team included technical crews and security			1
@entity1 look @entity98 's @entity97 reporting live from the scene			2
he was part of a 21 - strong news gathering team from the corporation based on site during the eviction another report live from the eviction scene - footage which also appeared in the same news bulletin for @entity108 broadcast : @entity1 's @entity111 's @entity110 also reported from the scene a spokesman also said another three @entity1 employees were part of non-news documentary team which had been on site for weeks making a programme about the @entity3 eviction			1
the @entity1 has refused to specify exactly which of their news gathering teams were reporting from the scene			2
however , broadcasts of the eviction have appeared on regional bulletin @entity108 , current affairs programme @entity126 and @entity111 , as well as other reports on localised bulletins			0
@entity130 spokesman @entity130 said the staffing levels were ' ludicrous ' and could affect public sympathy for the @entity1 's proposed 20 per cent budget cuts , the @entity129 reported			1
a spokesman said : ' the eviction at @entity3 has been a major rolling news story and we had 21 people there including reporters , producers , technical staff and security , covering the story locally and nationally for numerous outlets for tv , radio and online			1
' a small non-news documentary team has separately been on - site for some weeks			0
' today , @entity149 officers - escorted by police and bailiffs - toured the site serving 48 - hour eviction notices to those travellers who stayed at the camp overnight and pinning them to plots			2
the notices inform residents what will be removed and includes demolishing fences and walls to allow access , although these will be reinstated			0
the @entity1 said the staff included television and radio news gathering teams along with their technical crews and security			2
it also said two satellite trucks and two radio cars were on site were for the power supply and to enable reports to be broadcast			0
on the scene : @entity126 's @entity175 had also reported from the site of the @entity3 eviction the spokesman added : ' there were 21 people there as part of the news gathering team			0
this included television camera and radio crews and all their technical staff , sound engineers and security			0
' ( local correspondents ) would have been part of the overall news gathering team			0
' there were also people from a documentary team there , but this would have been no more than three members of staff , bringing the total number of @entity1 staff up to 24			2
' we also had two trucks on site which was n't for accommodation but for the power supply to put the tv reports out			0
we did not have any accommodation on site			0
' and so it begins : a council official staples a notice to a fence on a plot			0
the notices inform residents what will be removed the last remaining few : a little girl peers out of a window which now has an eviction notice stuck to it			0
between 20 and 30 residents remained inside the site overnight - despite a mass walk - out dismantle : bailiffs and council officials enter the @entity3 travellers ' site to serve 48 - hour eviction notices on plots and to a few families that have remained eviction completed : travellers and their supporters walk out of @entity3 near @entity12 after being driven off the land by police and bailiffs at the end of a two - day stand off final exit : a group of female travellers follow a caravan as it is driven from @entity3 yesterday an @entity242 traveller walks past the remains of a burnt out barricade in front of riot police			2

criticism after staff ' outnumber ' travellers and activists
@entity9 first denies it hired a caravan for eviction coverage *...* then admits it rented vehicle for ' toilet facilities '
