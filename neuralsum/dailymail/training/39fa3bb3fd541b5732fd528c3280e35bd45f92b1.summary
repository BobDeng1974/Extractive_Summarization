@entity0 claims he is not certain he 'd swap his managerial career for sir @entity2 's , and also admits it was once unthinkable for an @entity5 boss to pick players who were not representing their clubs every week			1
the current @entity5 boss has not won a trophy since 2001 with @entity9 , but said he would not necessarily want to swap his achievements for the former @entity12 boss ' , having managed 16 teams in eight countries			1
' but if you ask me , would it have been better to have been like @entity2 , to have spent life at one club , if i ’d been lucky enough to do that ? i ’m not certain i ’d say “ yes , i would have preferred that ”			0
' @entity0 , who performed the great escape with @entity29 in 2008 , and also helped @entity30 become an established mid-table side , also claimed it is sometimes harder to achieve survival than win titles			2
' you do n’t win prizes for [ keeping teams up ] or get a trophy on your cv ... but when ( for example ) you ’re winning the @entity41 with the current @entity43 team , is that as great an achievement as – say – keeping @entity45 in the @entity46 ? it ’s very difficult to assess these things			0
' success : @entity2 won the @entity50 twice and the @entity46 13 times @entity0 , whose @entity5 side failed to get out of the group stage at the @entity54 in @entity55 this summer , said he 'd rather some players moved abroad for more game time than sit on the bench in the @entity46			1
the 67 - year - old also concedes that times have changed with the national team , and that he has to pick players who are not regularly playing with their clubs , something that was unthinkable even five years ago			1
@entity0 added : ' if you ’re asking , would it be better for some of our players to play regularly for a good team abroad , rather than warm the bench here , then of course			1
as a national team manager , i ’d like to see that			0
relative : @entity0 says survival , like keeping @entity29 up in 2008 , can be sweeter than any trophy ' even as recently as five years ago – certainly ten years ago – it would be unthinkable for any @entity5 national team manager to pick a player who was n’t the first name on his club ’s teamsheet			1
' now we pick players – more than half probably – who start with us , and are certainly not the first name on their club ’s teamsheet			0
' they might not even get a regular game			0
but that ’s where we are , because the clubs have a predominance of foreign players , and because they can afford it			2
' they can get the best players outside of @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity43			0
and basically speaking , there are n’t many clubs who can tempt away @entity102 players			0
' @entity0 's @entity5 take on @entity103 in a friendly at @entity105 on september 3 , before facing @entity106 in their first @entity108 qualifier on september 8			2
in an ideal world : @entity0 wants his @entity5 players playing regularly for their club the @entity112 shares the experiences of coaches in some of the most difficult places in the world , with members including @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
