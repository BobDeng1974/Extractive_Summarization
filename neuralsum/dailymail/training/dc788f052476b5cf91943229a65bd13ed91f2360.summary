by @entity0 published : 17:37 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 09:18 est , 15 august 2012 a 10 - year - old girl was lost in @entity3 's second - biggest airport because an airline worker forgot to pick her up at the gate and flight attendants repeatedly refused to help because they were busy			1
@entity8 was flying from her hometown of @entity10 to @entity11 where she was scheduled to make a connection and fly to @entity13 , @entity14 for summer camp			1
like a scene out of @entity18 , the young girl was lost in @entity11 's o'hare airport and missed her connecting flight			1
familiar story : like in @entity18 where the main character is lost in @entity11 's @entity24 airport , @entity8 missed her flight to summer camp multiple mistakes : a friend of the girl 's parents told how @entity31 did not contact the family until the case gained media attention @entity8 's parents only found out that their daughter had trouble with the airline once a camp counselor called to say that the girl never showed up			1
the incident became public after a friend of the couple wrote about their trouble with @entity31 on his blog , bringing the plight of @entity48 and @entity49 who tried to understand how their daughter was left to fend for herself in the airport			0
after an estimated 18 hours of phone calls with @entity31 as they searched for answers , the @entity53 found out that the escorts that the company uses to collect and drop off unaccompanied minors during solo flights are actually managed by a third - party service			2
in their daughter 's case , the representative did n't show up at the gate in @entity11 because they forgot about her			1
on top of that failure , the @entity31 attendants who were on the plane were ' busy and could not help ' the confused girl as she waited for the escort			2
' she asked three times to use a phone to call us and they told her to wait			0
when she missed the flight she asked if someone had called camp to make sure they knew and they told her " yes — we will take care of it "			2
no one did , ' the parents wrote in a letter of complaint to the airline that was reposted on their friend @entity88 's blog			0
concerned parent : @entity49 , a professor at @entity91 , wrote a letter of complaint that went unanswered and estimates that he and his wife have spent 18 hours on the phone over the issue maze : @entity8 flew from @entity10 ( left ) to @entity11 ( right ) where she was supposed to have an employee escort her to her connecting flight , but the person never showed up ' she was sad and scared and no one helped			1
' the @entity101 reports that eventually , @entity8 was put on a flight to @entity14 four hours later , and because of the confusion her bags were lost and they took three more days to be reconnected with her at camp			1
previous career : before becoming a professor , @entity49 apparently modeled for gap on his blog , mr @entity88 tells of how his friend and colleague @entity110 , who is a professor at @entity91 , has been continually frustrated by @entity31 's treatment and dismissal of the gravity of the situation			0
when on the phone with one customer service representative while @entity8 was still wandering around the @entity11 airport unaccompanied , the representative almost hung up saying that she could be of no more help because her shift was about to end			1
a maternal plea from mrs @entity123 eventually prompted the worker to spend 15 minutes tracking the young girl down herself			0
mr @entity88 says that @entity31 was ' completely unresponsive ' until the couple told a local reporter about the incident and she started asking questions			0
after that pressure , an airline representative contacted them directly and released a statement apologizing for their alleged actions			0
' we reached out directly to the @entity53 to apologize and we are reviewing this matter , ' @entity31 said in a statement to @entity101			0
' what the @entity53 describe is not the service we aim to deliver to our customers			0
we are redepositing the miles used to purchase the ticket back into mr. @entity49 ’s account in addition to refunding the unaccompanied minor charge			2
' @entity8 told her parents that she never wants to fly @entity31 again .			2

@entity8 , 10 , was traveling from @entity10 to summer camp in @entity14 with a *layover* in @entity11 , and an unaccompanied minor escort was supposed to meet her at the gate
the third - party representative ' forgot ' to show up , and flight attendants were ' too busy ' to help
she got lost in @entity24 like in @entity18 and missed her flight
