gathered in their hundreds , spectators crowd round to watch as two dogs are forced to fight to the death in barbaric cages			2
these shocking scenes from northern @entity6 drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country , who have called for a change in the law to protect the canines			1
but the local villagers who organised the event have defended the dogfights as necessary ' entertainment ' in an isolated part of the country			1
the competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along , and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug			0
one of the organisers , @entity56 , 45 , protested that because the village was in a poor rural area , the locals had to resort to creating their own entertainment			1
he said : ' people in the city criticise our dogfights but they have all sorts of money to pay for entertainments which we do n't have access to			2
we have to organise things to entertain ourselves			0
' while banned in some countries , dogfights are a common attraction in northern @entity6 which hosts more than 100 festivals each year attracting visitors from neighboring provinces and tourists alike			1
police have said the event did not breach any laws and that there have been no official complaints			2
they added that some of the people who who turned up had allegedly grabbed stray dogs off the street , and claimed they were their pets			0
attraction : while banned in some countries , dog fights are a common attraction in northern @entity6 violent : despite the vicious scenes sparking outrage , organisers have insisted that the dogfights are part of the traditional ' entertainment ' in the area brutal : the dogs are forced to fight to the death in cages , leading to calls from animal rights activists for new cruelty laws rural : organiser @entity56 declared the dogfights as a ' great success ' and added : ' we plan to do the same thing next year ' @entity6 has no animal cruelty laws , and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody			1
dogfighting is illegal , but only if it involves bets			0
simply allowing the animals to fight purely for entertainment comes into a grey area where it is difficult to prosecute anyone involved			0
@entity127 , an animal rights activist in the country said , said : ' events like these are exactly why we need a functioning animal cruelty law in @entity6 , because people do that they want and get away with it unless they know the law can stop them			1
