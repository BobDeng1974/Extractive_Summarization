i 'm not going to comment on either the economics or the politics of it			0
i do n't know what 's in @entity2 's heart , so i 'm not going to comment on the sincerity of his apology			2
' but he said that he was compelled to offer his support to @entity12 after considering his own children , daughters @entity44 , 13 , and @entity45 , 10			1
@entity21 said : ' the reason i called ms @entity12 is because i thought about @entity44 and @entity45 , and one of the things i want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about , even ones i may not agree with them on '			1
reaction : @entity13 law student and activist @entity12 speaks during an appearance on the daytime talk show , ' @entity56 ' about the comments he made on his programme he added : ' i want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way			1
and i do n't want them attacked or called horrible names because they 're being good citizens '			2
and i wanted @entity12 to know that i thought her parents should be proud of her , and that we want to send a message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves argument and disagreements and debate , and we want you to be engaged , and there 's a way to do it that does n't involve you being demeaned and insulted , particularly when you ’re a private citizen '			1

' the statements he ’s made about me over the air are personal enough , so i ’d rather not have a personal phone call with him , ' @entity12 said on @entity142 ’s ' @entity56			1
' anger : many advertisers reacted to @entity2 's controversial ' slut ' comments by suspending adverts on the programme decision : @entity150 has also decided to boycott the show @entity2 admitted that his ' choice of words was not the best ' and could n’t resist taking a swipe at his opponents			2

' it ’s what we ’ve come to expect from them , but it ’s way beneath me			0
' the comments have amplified an election - year clash over @entity21 ’s plan to require health insurers to cover contraception			1
@entity172 presidential candidates have cast the plan as an attack on religion as they court socially conservative voters before tonight ’s 10 - state ' @entity178 tuesday ' primary contest			1
but they have distanced themselves from @entity2 ’s incendiary rhetoric as polls show that nearly two - thirds of voters support @entity21 ’s plan			1
@entity2 apologised again yesterday , but continued to criticize @entity12 ’s efforts to force the @entity185 university to include contraception in its health insurance coverage			1

that did not satisfy catholic bishops , who reject artificial contraceptives			0
@entity172 in @entity133 have unsuccessfully tried to repeal the new birth control rule , an effort that @entity232 , in turn , have cast as a @entity172 ' war on women '			0
the @entity235 says it has raised $ 1.6million since @entity12 testified on @entity236 two weeks ago , tying the flurry of donations to outrage over the @entity172 ’ action			1
