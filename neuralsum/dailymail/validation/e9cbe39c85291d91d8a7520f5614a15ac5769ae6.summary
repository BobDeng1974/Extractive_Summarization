@entity0 hopes to banish the password from mobile phones and computer with the next version of @entity5			1
instead of remembering a complex password , users will simply need to look at their phone or use a fingerprint reader			1
called @entity11 , it will be part of @entity5 10 when it launches later this year			1
the cameras use infrared technology to identify your face or iris and can recognize you in a variety of lighting conditions			0
these security features are opt - in , meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and @entity33 to unlock devices and features if they so desire			1
' when we started building @entity5 10 , the team spent a lot of time and energy thinking about how to make computing more personal , ' said @entity42 of @entity0			1
' we want your devices to recognize you , to understand what you 're saying … we want the experience to go wherever you do and we want you to feel a great sense of @entity47 as you go			0
called @entity49 , the new system introduces support for biometric authentication – using your face , iris , or fingerprint to unlock your devices – with technology that is much safer than traditional passwords			1
' you - uniquely you - plus your device are the keys to your @entity5 experience , apps , data and even websites and services – not a random assortment of letters and numbers that are easily forgotten , hacked , or written down and pinned to a bulletin board , ' @entity42 said			1
the firm is also confident the system can not be fooled - and has even tested users holding up pictures of others			2
' a combination of special hardware and software will be used to accurately verify it is you , not a picture of you or someone trying to impersonate you , ' @entity0 said			0

' not only is @entity11 more convenient than typing a password — it 's more secure ! ' our system enables you to authenticate applications , enterprise content , and even certain online experiences without a password being stored on your device or in a network server at all			1
' the firm also hit out at current password systems			0
' today , passwords are the primary method most of us use to protect our personal information , but they are inconvenient and insecure			0
individual documents can also be locked using the technology ' they are easily hackable and even when complex they are not effective , but most of us want something easy to remember , so we either choose a simple password or end up noting it down somewhere making it less secure			0
' you may have seen recent press coverage about a single group collecting 1.2 billion user names and passwords from websites they hacked			0
' this creates lousy odds in the hacker roulette for all of us – there are only about 2 billion people online today ! ' @entity5 10 will include a new @entity144 app to allow users to easily share with friends , and is extremely similar to the firm 's @entity144 console system			1
the company also revealed that @entity5 10 devices shipping this autumn will have built - in @entity11 features , and devices that already have fingerprint readers will also support the technology			1
' oem systems incorporating @entity158 's @entity157 ( @entity159 ) will support the facial and iris unlock features of @entity11 , including automatic sign - in to @entity5 , and support to unlock passport without the need for a pin , ' the company said			1
these security features are opt - in , meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and @entity33 to unlock devices and features if they so desire .			2
