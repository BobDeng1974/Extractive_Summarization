a leading high street chemist is offering a diy kit called @entity9 that copies a form of fertility treatment called intrauterine insemination ( @entity14 )			1
it will be available for just £ 100 – a fraction of the £ 1,000 cost of going to a private clinic for a course of similar treatment			1
high - street baby - making : the new @entity22 fertility treatment kit @entity9 copies a form of intrauterine insemination ( @entity14 ) and is designed to be used at home its makers say the device ‘ helps bridge the gap between natural intercourse and in - clinic assisted treatments such as @entity14 and @entity33 ’			1
they claim a success rate of about 20 per cent , comparable to the same treatment carried out by a doctor			2
however , studies on the method found that pregnancy rates between those in the programme and couples who dropped out and conceived without therapy were about the same			0
the @entity9 , pictured above , which is now available online from @entity47 , is supposedly designed to help couples with ‘ common fertility difficulties such as low sperm count , low sperm motility , ovulation timing and unexplained infertility ’			1
it works by first collecting semen into a cervical cap , which is located at the bottom of a condom - like sheath			0
happy news : the makers of @entity9 claim a success rate of about 20 per cent an applicator then delivers the cervical cap containing the semen to the entrance of the cervix			1
the cap is left next the cervix for between four and six hours , then removed using a tampon - like pull cord			0
the cap keeps the semen as close to the cervix as possible to allow sperm to swim up to the egg			0
the makers maintain that normal daily activities can be carried out while the cap is in place			2
it is recommended that @entity9 be used just before and / or during ovulation			2
gynaecologist @entity79 , of the @entity80 in @entity81 , felt the device had a place for some couples but pointed out that @entity9 was not exactly the same as @entity14			1
under @entity14 , sperm is collected and ‘ cleaned up ’ before being placed into the woman ’s womb close to the time of ovulation			0
‘ this would be an ideal option if a couple can no longer have treatment on the @entity96 or can not afford to self - fund at a private clinic , ’ he said			0

the @entity9 copies a form of intrauterine insemination treatment
it opens up for fertility treatment to take place outside clinics
the kit costs £ 100 in high street chemists and is meant for home use
