by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd former @entity2 ' keeper @entity1 has warned young @entity4 full back @entity3 that a move to @entity6 probably is n't right for him			1
while former players usually speak highly of their old clubs , @entity1 has gone off the beaten track by suggesting a move to what he calls ' a tough place to go ' could prove harmful to his career			2
@entity3 was a star of the @entity4 national side that reached the @entity16 quarter finals in @entity17 and his performances there and for his club @entity19 have peaked interest from @entity2			1
@entity21 : spurs have shown interest in @entity3 but @entity1 has warned against a move stop right there : @entity1 does n't seem to think a move to @entity2 is right for his countryman but @entity1 says a move to @entity30 's side might not be a good idea for the 21 - year - old - or even a possibility due to paperwork issues			1
' @entity2 is a tricky place to play , ' @entity1 said			1
' they 're a team that has a lot of turnover in players			0
spurs are a team that has the money , and they are always looking for a bargain , but it 's a tough place to go			0
' and @entity1 told goal that he only wants the best for young @entity4 footballers - hence his wariness of a move to @entity2			1
top class : @entity3 has shown his quality on the international stage and in the @entity53 with the @entity19 ' i just want to see young @entity4 players play regularly , week in and week out			1
if that 's at @entity2 , great			0
but if it 's not , then it 's not the right move			0
it 's hard to develop if you do n't play			0
' i 'm not sure @entity3 would even qualify for a work permit			2
he 's never started a game for the national team , [ @entity64 ] is a tough place to get a work permit			2
' my guess would be that if @entity2 is in the race , it would be to sign @entity3 and loan him out somewhere			0
' strengthening : @entity30 has been looking to improve a defence that shipped goals last season			0

@entity19 full back @entity3 has *attracted* interest from @entity2
he performed well for the @entity78 side at the @entity16
but @entity1 says a move for @entity2 could prove difficult for the @entity4
he *describes* the @entity83 club as ' a tricky place to play '
and the former @entity4 keeper says he may not even get a work permit
