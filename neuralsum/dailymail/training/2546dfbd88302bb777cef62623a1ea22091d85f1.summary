the planet 's last major cold spell 13,000 years ago was caused by a catastrophic deluge of frigid fresh water from north - west @entity5 into the @entity6 , a new study suggests			1
detailed computer simulations show meltwater from the enormous @entity9 halted the sinking of very dense , saltier , colder water in the @entity12			1
that stopped the large scale ocean circulation - the so - called thermohaline circulation - that transports heat to @entity17 and @entity18 , causing the continents to dramatically freeze			2
detailed : a new model of flood waters from the melting @entity9 shows how water first flowed north - west into the @entity6 , weakening deep ocean circulation and leading to the @entity24 's last major cold period the findings offer a new explanation for the cause of this last big chill , which scientists had thought was caused by freshwater flowing into the @entity12 through @entity5 's @entity31			1
it led to a cold spell lasting more than 1,000 years known as the @entity34 or ' @entity35 ' , during which temperatures in parts of the northern hemisphere fell to about 10 degrees c colder than they are today			0
' this episode was the last time the @entity24 underwent a major cooling , so understanding exactly what caused it is very important for understanding how our modern - day climate might change in the future , ' said @entity47 , of the @entity48			1
ice around the @entity51 has expanded to cover a record area , scientists have revealed – after saying that the @entity53 had lost an unprecedented amount of its ice			0
researchers say – rather confusingly – that both occurrences are down to the ‘ complex and surprising ’ effects of global warming			0
the record @entity61 sea ice cover was revealed in satellite images from the @entity63 in @entity64			0
at the end of the southern winter in september , ice covered 7.51million square miles of sea – more than at any time since records began in 1979			0
for the last 30 years the amount of @entity61 sea ice has been increasing by 1 per cent each decade			0
while the rest of the world has been getting warmer over the last 50 years , large parts of the @entity61 have been getting cooler			0
scientists say a cooler @entity61 fits in with the unpredictable nature of climate change			1
the cooling began after @entity81 , at the southern edge of the @entity9 ice sheet covering much of the @entity5 @entity6 , broke through an ice dam and dumped thousands of cubic kilometers of cold water into the ocean			1
using a high resolution , global , ocean - ice circulation model 10 to 20 times more powerful than previous ones , the researchers compared how meltwater from the two different drainage outlets affected ocean circulation			2
the original hypothesis , proposed 1989 by @entity95 of @entity96 , suggested that @entity97 drained into the @entity12 down the @entity98			0
but using the new model , dr @entity47 , working with @entity100 of the @entity101 , found that this proposed route would have weakened the oceans ' thermohaline circulation by less than 15 per cent			0
that level of weakening , they say , is unlikely to have accounted for the 1,000 - year cold climate event that followed the flood			1
@entity110 from the @entity98 actually ends up almost 1,900 miles south of the deep water formation regions , too far south to have any significant impact on the sinking of surface waters			0
by contrast , dr @entity47 and dr @entity100 's model shows that if the meltwater first drains into the @entity6 , narrow coastal boundary currents efficiently deliver it to the deep water formation regions of the sub-polar north @entity12 , weakening the thermohaline circulation by more than 30 per cent			1
they conclude that this scenario , showing meltwater discharged first into the @entity6 rather than down the @entity98 valley , is ' more likely to have triggered the @entity34 cooling			1
' dr @entity47 and dr @entity100 ran their simulations on one of the world 's top supercomputers at the @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity133			0
@entity136 's @entity135 ice - sheet : much of @entity17 and @entity18 would have looked like this after the meltwater from the @entity9 brought about a dramatic global cooling reporting their findings in the journal @entity143 , they wrote : ' with this higher resolution modelling , our ability to capture narrow ocean currents dramatically improves our understanding of where the fresh water may be going			1
' dr @entity47 added : ' the results we obtain are only possible by using a much higher computational power available with faster computers			0
' older models were n't powerful enough to model the different pathways because they contained too few data points to capture smaller - scale , faster - moving coastal currents			2
' ' our results are particularly relevant for how we model the melting of the @entity162 and @entity61 ice sheets now and in the future			2
' it is apparent from our results that climate scientists are artificially introducing fresh water into their models over large parts of the ocean that freshwater would never have reached			2
' in addition , our work points to the @entity6 as a primary trigger for climate change			1
this is especially relevant considering the rapid changes that have been occurring in this region in the last 10 years			2

findings show how the *conditions* in the @entity6 can act as a ' primary trigger ' for climate change - relevant given the changes happening now
