by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 14 november 2013 a college student who was left with a paralyzed face after being diagnosed with @entity4 ’s @entity3 found an inspiring way to deal with the condition , using it for a @entity8 costume mimicking ' not - impressed ' gymnast @entity9			1
@entity10 had been struggling to cope with the condition , which causes temporary paralysis in one side of the face , after being struck down in august while a student at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
after she posted a picture of herself on @entity21 , someone pointed out that the @entity4 's @entity3 had left her looking like @entity9 after she took a tumble and only won the silver medal in the vault finals at the @entity25			1
@entity4 's @entity3 sufferer @entity10 , left , turned her condition , which causes paralysis on one side of the face , into a brilliant @entity8 costume based on ' not impressed ' @entity31 gymnast @entity9 , right it quickly became a popular internet meme with even president @entity34 getting involved and pulling his own ' not - impressed ' look in the @entity36			1
the condition was named after @entity38 ( 1774 - 1842 ) , a @entity39 anatomist and surgeon known for a number of neurological finds , including the discovery that the inflammation of the facial nerve that travels through the skull in a narrow bony canal can cause temporary paralysis of the facial muscles on one side			2
@entity4 ’s @entity3 is a rare condition , affecting one person in 5,000 , and has no known specific causes , though it ’s thought that viruses might play a part			1
when a nerve is not functioning or missing muscles in the face do not receive essential signals to work properly			0
this results in paralysis of areas of the face each side of the face has its own facial nerve , so damaging the left facial nerve will only affect the left side of the face , and vice versa			0
the condition can also be triggered by surgery , @entity73 , neurological conditions , traumatic injuries to the brain , skull or face , birth trauma and congenital conditions			2
after dressing up as @entity9 for @entity8 , miss @entity10 posted a picture to the gymnast 's facebook page			1
she wrote : ' two months ago i was diagnosed with @entity3 , which means the right side of my face is temporarily paralyzed and i can only express emotion on my left			1
' last week at a party someone pointed out that i normally look like your " not impressed " face			0
i decided to incorporate my disability into my @entity8 costume and dress up as you			0
' this has hands down been the best costume i 've ever had			0
it was the first time in months i got to look like i was intentionally making a face and it has helped me deal with the slow recovery a little better			0
' miss @entity10 also went on a first date at what she described as ' the apex ' of the palsy , which caused her to constantly blink out of one eye while attempting to make small talk			2
@entity3 is a condition with affects around one in 5,000 people with most making a full recovery			1
although the exact cause is unknown , it 's thought to be because the facial nerve becomes inflamed , possibly due to a viral infection			0
@entity115 had @entity3 when he was at middle school and got called ‘ @entity117 ’ as s a result			2
fellow actor @entity119 also suffered from the condition - both made a full recocvery			0
