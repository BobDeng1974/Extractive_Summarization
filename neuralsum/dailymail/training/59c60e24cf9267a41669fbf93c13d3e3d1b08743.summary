@entity1 – who has been at the corporation for more than 50 years – called on the director - general to hand out the licence fee to its commercial rivals to create ‘ more variety ’ in tv and radio output			1
he said the @entity2 should ‘ cut out some of the gardening and the cookery ’ on tv , merge @entity16 with @entity17 , and reduce its online presence to prevent it ‘ crushing ’ local newspapers			1
the 75 - year - old , who has anchored every general election since 1979 , also criticised the @entity2 ’s ‘ terrible ’ coverage of last year ’s @entity23 , saying he was ‘ rueful ’ he had n’t been asked to front it			1
mr @entity1 ’s intervention will add to mounting pressure on director - general @entity27 to accept dramatic cuts to his budget when the licence fee is renegotiated			1
earlier this month , former head of tv news @entity31 admitted the @entity2 was too big and too left wing , and also suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of tv channels reduced			0
speaking to @entity38 on @entity39 today , mr @entity1 said : ‘ the public pay for the @entity2 is £ 3.5billion , more or less			1
it ’s a very , very powerful , big organisation , so it ’s right that it should be held to book , and of course when it gets something wrong ... it ’s a spectacular fall , as with the @entity23			2
’ the @entity46 host said the @entity2 needed to redefine its role when the @entity48 is renewed in 2016			2
in the past month , senior government figures have warned the @entity2 may face severe cuts unless it improves its coverage and addresses accusations of bias			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ [ the management need ] to answer questions about whether the @entity2 has got too big			2
whether it is too powerful for its own good			0
whether it ’s crushing newspapers , local newspapers particularly			0
i think there is some truth in that			0
i ’m not sure how you address it but i do think the @entity2 needs to pull back a bit from some of the things it does , maybe cut back a bit on some of its television channels			2
‘ i think that @entity16 for instance which has some very good high quality programming done on a shoe string , really on a shoe string ... merge that with @entity17 , cut out some of the gardening and the cookery and all that on @entity17 and focus on the quality stuff that it was meant to be			0
then you have two big channels , one and two			0
’ ' terrible ' : the broadcaster criticised @entity2 coverage of last year 's @entity82 pageant mr @entity1 admitted he may be ‘ taken to the cleaners ’ by his bosses for criticising the @entity2 so openly			1
but he added : ‘ if you have one organisation that controls so much of the airwaves , is that in the end democratic ? ’ he continued : ‘ i would use some of the licence fee to set up or to subsidise other independent radio and broadcast stations , so that you ’ve got variety			0
’ last week , home secretary @entity93 accused the @entity2 of undermining democracy by encroaching unfairly on local newspapers with its news websites			0
mr @entity1 – who sold his family ’s local newspaper business for £ 12million in 2001 – agreed with her assessment and suggested @entity2 websites should be slimmed down			1
he said : ‘ i think the question has to be addressed about the scale of the @entity2 , and people need to ask themselves , however well run it is , however careful it is , however much it attempts to be objective , in the end , is democracy well served by that ? last week , home secretary @entity93 accused the @entity2 of undermining democracy by encroaching unfairly on local newspapers with its news websites ‘ should we have more voices on the air , both on television and on radio , and should we pull back a bit on the thing [ former director - general ] @entity117 set up so brilliantly at its time , which is the internet , to allow space for local papers and indeed the national press which at the moment are being steamrollered by what we do with public money that comes in from the licence fee , for which you go to prison if you fail to pay up			1
’ asked for his opinion of the @entity2 ’s much - criticised coverage of the @entity23 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i thought it was terrible			1
i do n’t know what they thought they were doing frankly , but they thought that the pageant itself , the boats on the river , would n’t really work and it would be technically difficult			0
‘ so they thought they ’d have lots of side shows and the presenters would n’t have to know about the boats , and they ’d have some expert who knew about the boats			0
then everything collapsed and the expert could n’t be got on air			0

@entity1 called on @entity2 to ' cut out some of the gardening and cookery '
@entity46 presenter also criticised ' terrible ' coverage of @entity23
intervention adds to pressure of director - general @entity27 to accept cuts
