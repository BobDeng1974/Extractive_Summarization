@entity1 's big idea to launch a £ 15billion raid on pensions to fund a cut in the tuition fees of students was described as ‘ financially illiterate ’ yesterday			1
@entity7 confirmed he would slash fees from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 , despite warnings it would benefit the better - off and could damage universities			1
the @entity1 leader said the measure would help relieve the ‘ scourge of debt ’ which he said was holding back young people and the economy			1
@entity7 : @entity19 vice-chancellors have warned that his fees pledge could cause ' colossal ' damage by slashing funding for higher education but his announcement that @entity1 will raid middle - class pension pots to pay for it sparked a furious backlash			1
among the critics was the respected consumer champion @entity31 of @entity32 , who condemned them as ‘ financially illiterate ’			1
the tuition fee cut would apply from september 2016 , including students mid-way through courses			2
@entity1 plans to raise the money through two pension changes			2
the first is cutting tax relief from pensioners earning more than £ 150,000 from 45p to 20p			2
this saving had been earmarked to fund a ‘ jobs guarantee ’ for the young unemployed , but @entity1 sources admit the falling number of jobless young people means this would cost less than expected			2
secondly , the party would cut the ‘ lifetime allowance ’ for pensions from £ 1.25million to £ 1million and cap the amount which can be put away per year from £ 40,000 to £ 30,000			2
newly indebted : graduates must pay back fees of £ 9,000 , on top of other costs of getting educated under this threshold , pension savings would be taxed at the rate of income , with the first 25 per cent tax - free			2
but above this level , a punitive rate of 55 per cent would apply			2
the independent @entity60 described the pensions raid as ‘ misguided ’			2
@entity62 , director of the influential think - tank , said the policy entailed a ‘ significant tax increase ’			2
@entity60 analysis found the biggest winners from the change would be ‘ mid-to - high - income graduates … with the very highest earners benefiting the most ’			2
it said the plan would have little impact on the number of young people from poorer backgrounds entering higher education as they have not been put off by the hike to £ 9,000			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ this is the worst type of politics … that may appeal to people on the surface , but it ’s financially illiterate			1
’ he added that the policy ‘ effectively meant poorer students would be subsidising @entity90 investment banking graduates ’ – and said if any other party had launched it , @entity1 would be leading protests in the streets			2
mr @entity7 claimed the £ 2.9billion - a - year pensions raid , for at least five years , would only hit the very wealthy			1
but @entity94 analysis suggested the move would hit thousands of ordinary public sector workers , such as teachers , nurses and fire crews			1
the @entity1 leader also revealed high - earning graduates would face higher interest charges on student loans , to fund bigger bursaries for the poor – a policy critics called a ‘ tax on aspiration ’			2
@entity109 said @entity1 ’s ‘ ill - thought - out ’ plan would ‘ damage our universities and our economy , and hardworking taxpayers would pay the price ’			1
chancellor @entity115 added : ‘ [ @entity7 ’s ] new tax on pensions will hit many people on middle incomes … a tuition fees policy that only benefits better - off students is being paid for by hard - working taxpayers on middle incomes			1
’ speaking at @entity124 yesterday , mr @entity7 said his pledge to cut tuition fees was ‘ cast - iron ’ , adding : ‘ the scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people , it is a burden on our country			1
we ’re going to change it			2
’ but @entity94 analysis found the proposed £ 30,000 cap on annual pension contributions would hit those on final salary schemes who receive a promotion late in their careers			1
for example , a senior nurse earning £ 35,500 and promoted to matron on £ 53,500 after 25 years would face a potential £ 5,000 tax charge			2
a teacher on £ 27,000 promoted to head on £ 43,000 would face a tax bill of £ 900			2
consumer champion @entity31 of @entity32 said @entity1 's policy was ' financially illiterate ' @entity147 warned funding a tuition fees cut by curbing tax relief on pensions was ‘ playing @entity152 roulette with people ’s futures ’			1
spokesman @entity155 said : ‘ of course education is crucial … but so too is ensuring we foster a savings culture where people ensure they put enough by for their futures			0
’ @entity161 , of @entity162 , said @entity1 ’s plan was ‘ reckless ’ and would ‘ penalise responsible middle - income workers who want to provide for their retirement and make sure they are n’t a burden on the state ’			1
he added retirement savings were being viewed as a ‘ piggy bank which can be raided to pay for pre-election promises ’			0
mr @entity7 guaranteed to plug the university funding gap caused by the fees cut , for at least five years			1
but @entity173 , of the @entity174 of top universities , said members ‘ remain cautious ’ as the plan would make them ‘ vulnerable to future cuts ’			1
a shadow cabinet source said it was clear the money could be better spent elsewhere – but said mr @entity7 feared his credibility would be hit if he backed down			1
' there are lots of people who do n't think it 's worth the candle , ' the source said			1
' reducing fees from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 does not look like a game - changer , particularly this late in the day			0
it 's a lot of money to spend to leave fees at double the level they were when we left office			1
' but @entity7 sees this as a policy that he is personally associated with and thinks he ca n't abandon it			1
he wo n't be talked out of it , so that 's that			1
' @entity203 , head of the @entity205 policy unit under @entity206 , said the plan to cut tuition fees ' may not be a good policy '			1
he added : if i had upwards of £ 2 billion ( a year ) to spend on any policy , i would direct it into early - years education and childcare , not a reduction in tuition fees			0
' mr @entity203 , now director of mr @entity7 's favourite think tank the @entity221 , said the @entity223 's controversial reforms to tuition fees would lead to long - term problems for the public finances , but had not damaged young people 's enthusiasm for university			1
' the @entity223 's reforms have been very successful at increasing funding for universities , protecting fair access and upholding student numbers ( with the significant exception of part - time students , whose numbers have fallen dramatically ) , while at the same time cutting public spending , ' he said			1
how do tuition fees work now ? a degree can cost up to £ 9,000 year in tuition fees			0
medicine and law degrees can cost more			0
rent , living expenses and books are covered by a separate loan			0
unless students have wealthy parents , they need to apply for a loan from the @entity251			0
it is paid directly from the @entity251 to the university			0
but it ’s each student ’s responsibility to pay it back once they graduate			0
the interest rate is charged at different rates according to income , up to 5.5 per cent			0
in @entity262 , tuition fees have just been scrapped , while in the @entity265 the vast majority of students benefit from grants , scholarships or work - study schemes to keep the cost down			0
do the loans get repaid ? students repay 9 per cent of everything they earn above a £ 21,000 - a - year threshold			0
this is set to rise with average earnings from 2017			0
a graduate then continues to repay until they have cleared what they borrowed plus interest , or until 30 years have elapsed since the april after they graduated – whichever comes first			0
in practice , all but the highest - paid graduates end up repaying debt for all of the three decades			0
after 30 years , the debt is cleared , by which time the average earner will have repaid £ 46,300			0
the rising numbers of overseas students has led to fears thousands are deliberately avoiding loan repayments			1
this is because it is difficult to get the cash back through the @entity295 tax system when foreign students return home			0
would @entity1 ’s plan help ? critics warn @entity1 ’s plan to cut tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year by cutting tax relief on pensions would actually benefit the better - off			1
they say cutting fees helps those with a high starting salary as they can get rid of the debt more quickly			0
calculations by @entity31 of @entity32 show only those earning £ 35,000 a year , with inflation - linked pay rises , would benefit – including trainee lawyers and bankers			1
estimates by the @entity315 also suggest the plans would help top earners			0
most lower - earning graduates would be unaffected , it said			0
how would this affect pensions ? capping pension pots at £ 1million means a 65 - year - old who swaps this pot for an inflation - linked annuity – an insurance policy which pays out until you die – for themselves and their spouse would get no more than £ 27,000 a year			0
for savers desperate to retire on a comfortable income , this is hardly aspirational – and would not encourage saving			0
for those in generous final salary schemes funded by their employer – public sector workers and civil servants – the limit would mean they could take up to £ 50,000			0
others say cuts are likely only to hurt those whom the policy is supposed to help			0
it will do nothing to redistribute wealth from those who have already accumulated large pension pots , and instead simply restrict opportunities to build up a big pension for those just starting work			0
has n’t @entity1 already pledged to cut the rate of relief ? yes			0
it previously said it would use the money , an estimated £ 500million , to fund its compulsory jobs guarantee and apprenticeships			0
but this will now be covered instead by a planned surplus from corporation tax receipts in the wake of a cut and freeze of business rates .			0
