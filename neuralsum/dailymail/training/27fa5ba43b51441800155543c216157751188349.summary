totally accurate : statistician @entity0 correctly called all 50 states in the @entity3 presidential election using a unique mathematical formula to every politico , pundit and punter from @entity9 to @entity10 , this was a presidential election contest between two candidates separated only by a hair ’s breadth			1
‘ it is a toss - up , ’ the pundits said			2
‘ too close to call			0
’ @entity16 against @entity17 was so tightly - fought that sitting on the fence was the only way of avoiding being openly pilloried			1
but one analyst has won nationwide acclaim in @entity3 after trusting in his highly complex power of prediction to call @entity16 ’s resounding victory with stunning accuracy			1
@entity0 , a 34 - year - old statistician who at one time made a living from playing poker , correctly predicted all the states declared so far in what was billed as the tightest election race in decades			1
@entity0 ’s @entity33 blog on the @entity35 website became essential reading in the last few days before tuesday ’s election as his reputation grew as a pundit prepared to stick his neck out			2
his highly mathematical approach - which has echoes of the book and @entity45 film about baseball statistics ‘ @entity47 ’ - involves running hundreds of calculations for each state based on myriad factors , including election results from the past and polling data			1
@entity0 , an avowed @entity16 supporter , used his ‘ magic formula ’ to predict the president ’s re-election well before the first results came through			1
he calculated there was a 90.9 per cent likelihood of an @entity16 win and that the president would win 332 @entity63 seats compared to 206 for @entity17 – correct if the @entity64 wins @entity65 , which has yet to declare			1
his accuracy has drawn widespread praise in the @entity3			0
@entity69 television host @entity68 said during election coverage : ‘ you know who win the election tonight ? @entity0			2
’ @entity74 , writing a blog on the @entity77 site , said : ‘ here is the absolute , undoubted winner of this election : @entity0 and big data			2
’ one comedian took to @entity82 to call him ‘ @entity83 ’ four more years : president @entity16 was re-elected for a second term with a resounding win over @entity86 challenger @entity17 count on me : @entity0 accurately predicted the outcome in all 50 states and also in the @entity90 while the value of statistical analysis has long been appreciated in sport – @entity0 himself started out studying baseball data – it has long been rejected in politics , where pundits rely on ‘ gut feeling ’ to call the results			1
but after this week , @entity0 suddenly finds himself as the poster boy for a new ‘ @entity47 ’ approach to election punditry			1
@entity74 went on to proclaim : ‘ what does this victory mean ? that mathematical model can no longer be derided by ‘ gut - feeling ’ pundits			2
‘ that ’s @entity0 ’s contention – tv pundits are generally no more accurate than a coin toss – must now be given wider credence			1
’ @entity113 , a political scientist at @entity114 , went further : ‘ it shows that we can use systematic data – economic data , polling data – to separate momentum from no - mentum , to dispense with the gaseous emanations of pundits ’ ‘ guts ’ , and ultimately to forecast the winner			1
’ but @entity0 beating the traditional pollsters should n’t have come as a surprise – in the 2008 election , he was right on 49 out of the 50 states and all 35 @entity130 contests			1
the following year , @entity131 named him one of the world ’s most influential people			0
power of stats : @entity0 's methods have drawn comparison with the 2011 baseball film @entity47 , which starred @entity45 as coach @entity139 ( left ) and @entity140 as statistician @entity141 ( right ) his stock is now higher than ever			0
the @entity35 public editor @entity143 called him their ‘ most high - profile writer at this particular moment			0
’ twenty per cent of visits to the @entity35 website in the build - up to the election included a look at his blog			0
@entity0 , born in @entity152 , @entity153 , graduated from the @entity154 with a degree in economics after spending his third year of study at the @entity158			0
he briefly worked as a @entity160 - based consultant for @entity161 , though later described it as ‘ a job i did n’t like ’			1
in his spare time , he developed a program for projecting baseball player performance called @entity167			0
@entity0 resigned from @entity161 in april 2004 , having become a writer for the website @entity170 , to whom he sold his @entity167 system in return for a partnership interest			0
prior to the 2008 election , he switched to politics , saying : ‘ in politics , there ’s a lot of partisan screaming and conventional wisdom that ’s conventional but not very wise			0
’ no chance : silver was widely ridiculed when his calculations gave @entity86 challenger @entity17 just a 10 per cent chance of victory in 2010 , his existing blog at @entity33 was bought by the @entity35 and @entity0 revealed his models for predicting election results , based on a combination of electoral history , demographics and polling			1
in the early part of 2012 , it became more and more clear that @entity0 was backing @entity16 to win a second term , drawing criticism of his methods from @entity17 supporters and right - wing pundits			1
even others within the @entity35 expressed doubts – the highly - respected columnist @entity203 wrote : ‘ if there ’s one thing we know , it ’s that experts with fancy computer models are terrible at predicting human behaviour			2
’ @entity215 host @entity214 called him ‘ a joke ’ , and summed up the views of most pundits by adding : ‘ anyone that thinks that this race is anything but a toss - up right not is such an ideologue , they should be kept away from typewriters , computers , laptops and microphones for the next ten days			2
’ silver challenged @entity226 to a bet on @entity82 , saying : ‘ if you think it ’s a toss - up , let ’s bet			0
if @entity16 wins , you donate $ 1,000 to the @entity231			0
if @entity17 wins , i do			0
deal ? ’ his predictions prevailed and won a new respect for statistical methods			0
but there was no election night triumphalism from @entity0			0
in his final blog post , he simply wrote : ‘ there ’s a lot more to unpack in the coming days , but first , we ’re going to get some sleep and grab a beer			0

@entity0 , 34 , used an *elaborate* *series* of calculations to correctly call the outcome in all 50 states
he ran thousands of computer calculations based on innumerable factors such as polling results and *voting* outcomes in previous elections
gave @entity16 a 90.9 per cent chance of success , attracting widespread ridicule from traditional pundits in what was regarded as the closest race in years
his *achievement* opens the door for a more statistics - based approach to polling , say experts
