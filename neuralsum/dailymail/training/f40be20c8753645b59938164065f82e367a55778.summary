raunchy music videos similar to @entity2 's famous @entity1 and @entity3 ' b * * * * could be censored as officials clamp down on sexual content			1
addressing fears of the public , the @entity6 could now call for some music videos to be shown only after the watershed because of ' special worries ' about the material being shown			1
only yesterday @entity6 announced plans to change film classification so that children as young as 15 could watch feature films filled with obscenities			1
raunchy music videos , such as @entity2 's @entity1 , are set to be clamped down on in the @entity19 another artist whose videos are likely to be affected by the crack down is @entity23 , seen here in @entity25 the vow to crack down on the videos came as the @entity6 released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch			1
citing the increasing use of tablets , phones and computers , the body warned that children are able to watch violence and pornography without their parents knowing			1
as the @entity43 highlights today , the body noted that swear words are now so ‘ commonplace ’ among teenagers that it made the decision to relax age ratings			0
the @entity6 claims parents accept it is ‘ game over ’ when protecting their children from bad language			1
separately , it noted : ‘ a specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content , where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls , and pornography			0
‘ the content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries			0
’ it also said the ‘ sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern ’			0
‘ music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery , which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls ’ emotional wellbeing and social development , ’ the report said			2
‘ the overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity			0
’ @entity3 's @entity82 * * * * has been restricted in @entity83 on the grounds that it shows ' a sadomachistic universe representing women in a way that risks shocking many viewers ' @entity23 came in for criticism from her own fans for this music video , which she released in october last week , music videos featuring @entity2 and @entity3 were banned by @entity83 's broadcasting watchdog before 10pm			1
the @entity94 said that @entity2 's @entity1 and @entity3 's @entity82 * * * * must be shown when more ' adult ' programming is on			2

it currently has more than 475 million views			0
despite its popularity the clip drew concern from fellow songstress @entity106 after @entity2 said she was inspired by her 1990 @entity108 video			2
veteran performer @entity106 penned an open letter to the younger singer , urging her ' do n't let the music industry make a prostitute of you '			0
she wrote : ‘ i am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe , or encouraged you in your own belief , that it is in any way " cool " to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos			0
' it is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped , whether it ’s the music business or yourself doing the pimping			0
‘ nothing but harm will come in the long run , from allowing yourself to be exploited , and it is absolutely not in any way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women , for you to send across the message that you are to be valued ( even by you ) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent			0
’ last week , @entity2 's @entity1 video was banned in @entity83 before 10pm on television @entity138 , seen here in her video for @entity141 , could also be affected by the proposed crack down @entity3 's raunchy offering , which was released in october , has drawn more than 70 million viewers online			1
her video was also reportedly banned from @entity19 music channels before 10pm at the time of release , with broadcasters asking for a clean edit to go along with the much - censored work version of the song			2
meanwhile , in october @entity23 faced an extraordinary backlash after her own fans branded one of her videos ‘ obscene ’ , ‘ vile ’ and ‘ pornographic ’			1
