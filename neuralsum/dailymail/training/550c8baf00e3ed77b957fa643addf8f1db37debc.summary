by @entity0 last updated at 12:53 pm on 20th december 2011 floating robots are everywhere in science fiction			1
but the difficulty of keeping a heavy object ' floating ' on earth has ensured they remain thoroughly ficitonal on our planet			1
but in the low - gravity environment of the @entity11 , 240 miles up , it 's a different matter			2
@entity12 has just completed trials of a real , floating robot - a free - flying @entity16 which is controlled by a @entity18 phone			1
a @entity12 astronaut controls one of the @entity21 in testing on the @entity22 last month : the robots can fly , navigate and record information all by themselves the space agency freely admits that the inspiration for @entity21 - which completed testing successfully last month - came from science fiction			2
' i looked a little bit at the lightsaber training remote in @entity32			2
that was part of the inspiration , ' says @entity36 , who originated the concept			0
the compact , free - flying satellites -- known as @entity39 , engage , @entity40 , or spheres - have a ' brain ' formed of a @entity44 phone with the ' phone ' chip removed so it did n't interfere with electronics , and aa batteries instead of the lithium ion ones in @entity18 's phones			0
@entity32 provided the inspiration for @entity12 's floating droids - from a scene where @entity57 ' trains ' his lightsaber fighting skills by battling a floating orb the spheres move around by releasing carbon dioxide , which offers propulsion in the low - gravity environment of the @entity11 the robots will be able to inspect areas of the station for the @entity11 astronauts - and @entity12 also plans to test whether the robots could endure flights outside the station			1
in time , the space agencies , will test whether the robots can handle other , more challenging tasks			0
' the tests that we are conducting with @entity21 will help @entity12 make better use of robots as assistants to and versatile support for human explorers -- in @entity80 orbit or on long missions to other worlds and new destinations , ' said @entity84 , project manager of the @entity86 project			0
spheres in testing on board the @entity11 - the new version is ' piloted ' by an @entity92 smartphone			1
@entity12 is to test whether the devices could even fly outside the @entity11 each smartphone is connected to a @entity96 free - flyer via a cable			1
a wireless network connection ( @entity99 ) to the space station 's computers provides a connection to the ground			0
@entity12 anticipates using other types of smartphones on the station in the future .			0
