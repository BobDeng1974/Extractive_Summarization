@entity1 's @entity0 will take a two - shot lead into the third round of the @entity4 after threatening to record the first ever 59 on the @entity5 on friday			1
nine birdies in the first 16 holes at @entity8 , including five in a row from the eighth , left @entity11 needing two more to break the magical 60 barrier			2
however , the 22 - year - old former @entity14 champion narrowly failed to chip in from the edge of the green on the 17th and then dropped his only shot of the day on the last after finding a bunker off the tee			1
@entity0 made an impressive nine birdies in his round of 62 , and came close to going under 60 the resulting 62 gave the world number 403 a halfway total of 11 under par , two shots ahead of @entity28 's @entity27 , who birdied four of his last six holes to add a 66 to his opening 65			1
@entity27 's compatriots @entity33 and @entity34 , who won the @entity35 on sunday , were a shot further back on eight under alongside @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity40 's @entity39			1
@entity0 , who is mentored by former @entity42 captain @entity41 having played most of his junior golf at the latter 's home club in @entity46 , said : ' i was focused and did n't know that i had made five birdies in a row			2
it was an excellent round from the @entity51 , who leads in @entity53 after two rounds ' i was playing well and made a few putts , that 's all i was thinking about			0
the best golf is when you think as little as possible , and this was one of those days			0
' we were first to tee off this morning , conditions were perfect , the greens were perfect			0
i like playing this early so i really played well , made many birdies and am happy with my round			0
' @entity37 added a second round of 69 to his flawless opening 63 , but joint overnight leader @entity69 - who had finished his opening round with a hole - in - one on the eighth and eagle on the ninth - took five more shots to play those holes on friday as he struggled to a 72 to lie five under			2
@entity37 , who made a brilliant 63 on the first day , is four shots behind after a second round 69 ' i gave a few silly ones away and missed it on the wrong side occasionally as well , ' @entity37 said			2
' it 's a little bit disappointing i suppose but i still managed to make my fair share of birdies to keep it under par. ' i am three behind but there is a long way to go and this golf course can yield a lot of birdies as well as bogeys			0
i am in a nice position ; i would have taken that if you had given me it on wednesday			0
' home favourite and club member @entity95 is four off the lead after a 66 , with defending champion @entity98 three shots further back following a 67			1
@entity101 @entity42 captain @entity100 chipped in on the ninth for an eagle and repeated the trick on the 10th for a birdie , but also had two double bogeys in a 67 which left him on two under			0
defending champion @entity98 is some way off the pace after a second round of 67 in @entity53			1

@entity1 22 - year - old made nine birdies in first 16 , but could n't finish it off
@entity27 in second , with @entity38 's @entity37 four shots back
defending champion @entity98 seven shots off the lead following a 67
