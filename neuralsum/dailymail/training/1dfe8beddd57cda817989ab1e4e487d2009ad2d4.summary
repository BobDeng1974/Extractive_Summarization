by @entity0 published : 07:06 est , 23 april 2012 updated : 10:36 est , 23 april 2012 the @entity1 concluded in march that they should be made public – and this recommendation has now been formally accepted			1
the @entity1 took a stand over the papers last year out of concerns that details of the studies - which induced mutations in the virus that made it transmissible among mammals by air rather than by close physical contact - could be used for bioterrorism			1
green light : papers on the @entity18 avian flu virus will be published in @entity19 and @entity20 this year however , in a statement issued on friday , the director of the @entity23 , @entity24 , said : ‘ this information has clear value to national and international public health preparedness efforts and must be shared with those who are poised to realize the benefits of this research			1
’ when the @entity1 initially recommended the two papers should not be published in full by the journals where they were under consideration , @entity19 and @entity20 , critics raised fears that important science was being censored			1
the ensuing debate raised questions about whether the research should have been done at all , as well as whether current national and international rules on biosafety and biosecurity are sufficient to protect the public from dangerous microbes			2
the biosecurity panel spent two days earlier this year considering the papers			2
deadly : the natural form of @entity18 has infected tens of millions of birds both papers describe how scientists altered several genes of natural , or wild - type , @entity18 in a way that allowed it to spread from the airways of infected ferrets to other ferrets caged nearby			2
so far , the natural form of @entity18 has infected tens of millions of ducks , geese , chickens , and other birds			0
but the only people to be infected - 598 , of whom 353 have died - were those who came into close contact with the flocks			0
the board was persuaded by an additional benefit of publishing the research - by informing countries where @entity18 is endemic , it would allow scientists there to be on the lookout for the mutations that make the virus more transmissible			0
‘ we had new information , confidential information , about benefits of this research , and we also had confidential information about the risks involved , ’ said @entity73 of @entity74 , who is the acting chairman of the panel			0
‘ and the balance began to change			0
’ @entity83 , who led one of the experiments , said the @entity1 decision was ‘ very much to our pleasure			1
’ @entity24 added : ‘ the @entity89 government aims to preserve the benefits of vitally important life sciences research that holds the promise of enhancing quality of life for all of us , while minimizing the possibility that the knowledge , information , products , or technologies provided by such research could be misused for harm			0
