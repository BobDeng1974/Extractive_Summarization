the @entity0 said billions of euros were handed out without proper checks , and errors are on the rise the @entity6 is still wasting billions every year , spending watchdogs said today as they refused to sign off official accounts - again			1
it is the 18th successive year that the @entity0 has said the @entity6 ’s finances were in such a mess that they could not be given a clean bill of health			1
in fact errors are still on the rise			2
it included a ‘ special premium ’ paid to a farmer for 150 sheep which did not exist and 200,000 euros paid for a two - storey " laboratory " for producing fruit in @entity22 , @entity23 which inspectors found had ‘ predominantly the charters of a private residence ’			1
the revelations will heap pressure on @entity29 who suffered a humiliating @entity31 defeat last week as @entity32 and @entity34 rebels united to demand he insist on a cut on the vast budget at talks next month			2
the 27 member states and the executive commission stand accused of failing to do enough to track billions of pounds in spending at a time when countries are imposing deep spending cuts at homes			2
the @entity0 said that errors in @entity6 payments had risen to 3.9 per cent from the 2011 budget of almost 130billion euros ( £ 104billion )			1
it added that there were ‘ too many cases of @entity6 money not hitting the target or being used sub-optimally ’			2
acknowledging the clamour for cuts in spending , @entity0 president @entity53 said it was essential for the @entity6 to disburse its current budget ‘ more efficiently ’			1
he added : ‘ member states must agree on better rules for how @entity6 money is spent , and member states and the @entity62 must enforce them properly			0
’ @entity64 , a @entity66 @entity65 mep , said : ‘ if this report , outlining as it does the continued gross mismanagement of @entity6 funds , does n't set alarm bells ringing in @entity73 then nothing will			0
’ the former @entity62 chief accountant added : ‘ there is a new generation who will be voting later this month who have never known an @entity6 with clean accounts			1
’ @entity80 mep @entity64 , a former accounting officer for the @entity62 , said today 's report should set alarm bells ringing in @entity73 next month @entity6 leaders will clash at a summit clash over calls from @entity86 and @entity87 for inflation - busting rises in @entity6 spending , with mr @entity29 threatening to veto anything but a spending freeze			0
tonight mr @entity29 faces the threat of another @entity94 rebellion in the @entity31 , amid concerns that closer banking ties in the eurozone could sideline the @entity98			0
veteran eurosceptic conservative @entity99 will lead the revolt , demanding that the prime minister vetoes proposals to create a single eurozone banking supervisor unless there are changes to the @entity6 's treaties			0
mr @entity99 said : ‘ the eurozone would be given the opportunity to outvote the non-eurozone countries , which would effectively mean @entity110 and @entity111 versus the @entity98			0
that would be singularly bad news for the @entity98			0
’ today 's vote is unlikely to see the government defeated again , but will add to the pressure on mr @entity29 to take a tougher line with @entity118			0
the @entity0 report said the @entity62 and @entity6 governments ‘ must manage spending better ’			1
but the @entity62 responded that it was up to national and local authorities , who are responsible for disbursing about 80 per cent of the entire @entity6 budget in regional , social and agriculture grants every year , to get their books straight .			1
