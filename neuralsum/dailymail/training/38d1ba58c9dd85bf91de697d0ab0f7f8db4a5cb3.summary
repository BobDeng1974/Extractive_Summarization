by @entity0 in this modern image - conscious world , when we all want to portray ourselves in the best possible light , a man might want to smell of many things			0
he certainly wants to smell of diligently washed skin and newly cleaned clothes			0
he probably wants to smell of expensive hair products			0
he might even want to smell of whatever fragrance @entity10 is flogging this week , or some other fine aftershave			1
kicking up a stink : @entity14 attempts to bottle the smell of a ninth century @entity17 warrior but one thing he probably does n’t want to smell like is a stinking bearded warrior from 13 centuries ago			1
a stinking bearded warrior , who , to be precise , has a penchant for smashing up villages , wearing blood - stained battle gear and sporting awful helmet hair			2
nonetheless , this has n’t stopped tourist officials in @entity28 from launching ‘ @entity14 ’ , a – shall we say – niche - appeal perfume which will help a man to reek like a @entity17			1
visit @entity28 has created this bottled attack on our nostrils in tribute to the city ’s norse past			2
it has been concocted using assorted pungent ingredients : deep - soaked sweat ( worked up during a raid on a @entity43 settlement ) ; seawater ( from a long voyage across the @entity46 from the @entity17 heartland of @entity48 ) ; mud and damp ( from travels on foot over sodden terrain ) ; dried blood ( not necessarily model ’s own – from a day ’s fighting and pillaging )			1
fighting fit : the ' deodorant ' , launched by @entity57 , combines the aromas of blood , sweat , seawater and meat the eye - watering package is completed by the ‘ aromas ’ of cooked meat from @entity17 feasts , hard liquor ( @entity68 had a noted appetite for mead ) and – as a token pleasant inclusion – notes of fresh pine from all those lengthy hikes though deep - rooted forests			1
‘ with @entity14 , we wanted to try and capture the sort of smells that would have been part of the lives of @entity17 warriors around the time that @entity28 was the @entity14 capital of @entity83 , ’ says @entity76 , the marketing manager at @entity57			1
‘ but more than that , with all the bath products , deodorants , perfumes and aftershaves available today , we wanted to give male visitors to @entity28 the chance to cast aside their allegiance to modern aromas and instead embrace the smells from an era of warriors			1
’ the launch of @entity14 is , of course , just a bit of fun – although those who really want to smell like the inside of an animal - skin cloak can try the fragrance this weekend			1
it will be available to wear at @entity57 ’s main visitor centre this saturday and sunday ( 17 - 18 may ) – with men encouraged to swap their usual body spray for @entity17 stench			2
i 'll have what he 's having : the ' fragrance ' also contains the scent of roasted animal meat @entity28 was effectively the heart of @entity17 culture in @entity43 after it was attacked and quelled by @entity17 invaders in @entity117			2
the @entity17 era ran roughly between the end of the eighth century and the middle of the 11th			0
in @entity43 , it came to a bloody conclusion in 1066 , when an invading force from @entity48 was defeated at the @entity124 ( in modern @entity125 ) – just days before the @entity126 saw @entity127 and his cohorts complete the @entity129			0
notorious for their ferocity , @entity68 hailed from the @entity132 landmass ( especially @entity48 , @entity133 and @entity134 ) , although they also settled in @entity135			0
itinerant and aggressive , their attacks on @entity137 made them the scourge of the continent for almost 300 years – and even took them as far south as @entity142 and @entity143			0
however , for all their reputation as vicious killers , @entity68 were also great sailors and explorers – and there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that they crossed the @entity152 and ‘ discovered ’ the @entity153 ( not least @entity154 ) long before @entity155 .			0

*unholy* ' aftershave ' combines the smells of blood , sweat and smoking fires
fragrance is *design* to capture the essence of the notorious norse warriors
men are being asked to try ' @entity14 ' when it ' launches ' this weekend
