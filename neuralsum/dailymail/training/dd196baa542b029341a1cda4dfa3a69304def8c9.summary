@entity0 , @entity1 ’s programme director , has been flying 250 miles between @entity2 and @entity3 at the charity ’s expense since 2012			1
each trip costs @entity1 £ 200 and would generate 142kg of carbon dioxide emissions , according to airline @entity9			1
but mr @entity0 defended the arrangement and said he would rather not take the journey but it was necessary because the alternative is a twelve hour round trip by train			1
he told the @entity24 : ‘ i spend half my life on @entity26 and video conference calls			0
‘ but as a senior manager , the people who work in my team sometimes need to meet me in the flesh , that ’s why i ’ve been going to @entity3 twice a month while my team was being restructured			0
’ he said that from september he would switch to making the trip once a month by train due to ‘ the work of restructuring my team coming to an end , and with my kids a little older ’			2
mr @entity0 ’s travel arrangements were revealed just days after @entity1 was forced to apologise for losing £ 3million of public donations in an unauthorised currency dealing			1
the head of @entity1 in the @entity43 yesterday denied that funding mr @entity0 ’s commute showed a lack of integrity			1
@entity48 , head of @entity1 in the @entity43 , yesterday denied that funding mr @entity0 's commute showed a lack of integrity in a statement online @entity50 , executive director of @entity1 , said : ‘ as for @entity0 ’s air travel			1
well it ’s a really tough one			0
was it the right decision to allow him to use air travel to try to balance his job with the needs of his family for a while ? ‘ what kind of compromises do you make in your efforts to try to make the world a better place ? ‘ i think there is a line there			0
@entity70 and integrity to the values that are at the heart of the good you ’re trying to do in the world can not be allowed to slip away			0
for what it ’s worth , i do n’t think we ’ve crossed that line here at @entity1			0
’ but @entity1 members were outraged by the senior executive ’s commuting habits and called mr @entity0 a ‘ hypocrite ’			2
@entity1 volunteer of 30 years , @entity85 , said : ‘ i have to say i ’m deeply troubled by these revelations - i had hoped and assumed @entity1 was better than this			0
‘ i volunteer with @entity1 but work in the commercial world and if i took a job in another country i ’d expect to move to where the job is and if i could n’t for family reasons i would n’t take the job - so i find @entity0 ’s travel arrangements almost unbelievable			2
’ according to @entity1 flying is ten times worse for climate change than taking the train and is responsible for 13 per cent of the @entity43 ’s impact on the climate .			2
