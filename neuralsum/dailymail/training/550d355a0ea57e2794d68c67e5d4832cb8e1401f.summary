what a difference a year makes			0
as he claps and toddles happily , few would suspect that little @entity2 almost lost a finger when he was attacked in his home by a fox just a year ago			1
@entity2 was just five weeks old , when the urban fox sneaked inside , dragged him off a sofa and tried to pull him out of the house			1
he was saved when his mother @entity9 heard his screams and frantically followed a trail of blood to find the animal trying to drag him out through the front door			2
@entity9 kicked out repeatedly until the fox released her son and ran away , never to be found			2
healing process : @entity2 's hand now after a plastic surgeon reattached his finger in a five - hour operation after he was attacked by a fox at just five - weeks - old amazingly , @entity2 – then just 10lb – has grown into an active and mischievous toddler , blissfully unaware of how close he came to death			1
nor does he know he owes the use of his tiny hand to the skill of surgeons who performed an emergency five - hour operation to save his finger			1
today , the only clue to his ordeal are two tiny scars on his hand			2
@entity9 , 29 , said : ‘ @entity2 is my little miracle boy			1
i ca n’t count the number of times each day i think about how blessed we ’ve been			0
‘ he ’s lively and charming with sparkling blue eyes			0
but his birthday brought up a lot of emotions			0
it was hard not to be reminded of how close we came to losing him			0
’ @entity9 shivered as she recalled the day in february when she put her infant son on the settee and went upstairs			0
moments later , she heard him cry out and dashed down to soothe him – only to find he was no longer on the sofa			2
operation : @entity2 in hospital after the fox pulled him off a sofa and tried to drag him outside ' hero ' : @entity2 with mum @entity9 , dad @entity53 and siblings @entity55 , 10 , and @entity56 , six in a panic , @entity9 spotted her baby ’s blood and then the fox – with @entity2 ’s arm in its mouth – moving towards the front porch of their home in @entity66 , @entity67			1
@entity2 had gashes , weals and bruises on his head and was bleeding heavily from his hand			1
‘ @entity2 ’s finger was literally dangling backwards on to the back of his hand , ’ she added			1
‘ the fox had not cut through the bone but there seemed to be very little skin – or anything else – left keeping the finger attached to his hand			1
i could n’t look at it so i covered his hand up with his jumper until paramedics came			2
the @entity85 's report of the attack ‘ it was the most horrible experience of my life			0
‘ i still have nightmares about it and to this day i ca n’t let @entity2 out my sight			1
he even sleeps in my bedroom in a cot so i can be nearby at all times			0
‘ if that fox had been able to get him through the door , we might not have seen him again			2
people would have suspected that i ’d killed him			0
’ @entity2 was rushed to the @entity99 in @entity67 , where plastic surgeon @entity100 and his team operated to re-attach the third finger on his left hand			1
@entity9 said : ‘ for several days afterwards the finger was black			2
‘ we spent a week in hospital and were delighted when we started to see the colour coming back into @entity2 ’s finger			1
when the bandages came off in may , his finger was working perfectly			0
‘ for @entity2 , it was like nothing had happened			1
he was waving his hands around and not long after that he was using them to crawl			0
‘ he ’s regained all feeling			0
the only reminder we have is the scar at the base of his finger and some scarring above his wrist from a fox bite			1
an urban fox pictured on a nearby road to @entity124 home shortly after @entity2 was attacked ‘ all the marks on his head have healed , but @entity2 has a lot of trouble sleeping on his own			1
he screams if i leave him in his bedroom and will cry even if leave him in his pushchair			0
i do wonder if the attack has left him scared of being alone			0
’ @entity9 believes the fox got into their home after her fiance @entity135 , 28 , went out to collect their other children , @entity55 , ten , and @entity56 , six , without checking whether the door was closed correctly			1
‘ we felt so responsible for what had happened as parents , ’ she said			0
‘ i do n’t think that will ever go away , but we realise now that it was a freak accident			0
‘ we do n’t even blame the fox – it was an animal doing what animals do			1
as for @entity2 , he ’s my little hero			2
he ’s 23lb and is very strong			0
he keeps me on my toes all day – but i would n’t have it any other way			0
