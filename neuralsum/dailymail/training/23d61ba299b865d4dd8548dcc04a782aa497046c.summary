playing favorites : the @entity1 is flying mayor @entity3 's colors to curry favor with the @entity5 in advance of a decision about where its 2016 convention will take place @entity10 's famed @entity1 was lit up in blue on monday night – and will be again on tuesday – to honor the @entity11 in the hope of luring the party 's quadrennial convention and its hundreds of millions of revenue dollars to the @entity16			1
the partisan political stunt has passed with little controversy in the heavily @entity5 city , although the rules on the building 's website declare that the building ' does not light for political figures and campaigns			1
' the 1931 skyscraper is owned by a private real estate trust that floods its top spire with colored lights about every three days to celebrate holidays , honor sports victories and observe milestone anniversaries for @entity34 institutions			0
forty such lightings punctuated the @entity36 between may and july , including the national colors of @entity39 finalists @entity49 and @entity50 ; red , white and blue to acknowledge the 100th anniversary of @entity43 baseball ; bright green to mark the @entity47 holiday @entity45 ; and blue and yellow to honor ' @entity40			2
' but last week the building 's website added two last - minute observances as the @entity5 tasked with choosing a 2016 convention city prepared to visit @entity10 and hear mayor @entity3 's pitch			1
republicans are not amused , but also not surprised			0
' welcome to @entity3 ’s @entity10 , where being a liberal @entity58 is the top priority , ' @entity57 press secretary @entity56 told @entity60			0
communist @entity62 's 60th anniversary ( pictured ) ? check			1
@entity64 ? not so much monday and tuesday night 's skyscraper - lighting is part of a push to bring the @entity11 's 2016 convention to the @entity16 , despite rules prohibiting the use of the spire for political gain the @entity57 chose @entity73 as its host city in july , likely in a bid to curry favor with voters in the must - win presidential swing state of @entity79			1
the @entity5 have included @entity80 , @entity79 's capital , among their final three contender cities , along with @entity82 and @entity10			1
@entity83 reportedly pressured the @entity1 's controlling trust to bend its rules against political flattery with a display of ' blue and light blue for the @entity90 visit , ' as the building 's website describes it			1
while @entity5 had an easy path to seeing their colors 1,453 feet in the air , @entity93 reported that a father whose five - year - old son died of brain cancer was denied the chance to honor @entity64 month with a gold light - up in september			2
shortly before he died , tiny @entity102 told his father , ' i 'm not going to grow up to do anything			0
' now his father @entity106 is facing a stone wall in the form of building managers who refuse to honor his request			0
they cite a policy against agreeing to requests based on ' petitions and / or social media campaigns , ' according to the @entity118 blog			0
in june the building went rainbow for the @entity121 observance in @entity10 bending the rules : mayor @entity3 aims to outgun @entity82 and @entity80 , @entity79 and is pulling out all the stops , including the politicization of a timeless landmark the building 's owners are silent on the effectiveness of requests from the mayor 's office , but insist that ' we are unable to light for all who apply			1
' they famously refused to honor @entity135 , the sainted nun , after her death in 2010 , but participated in a pr campaign for the 25th anniversary of the @entity141 franchise a year earlier			0
the building also glowed in special hues to launch pop music albums by @entity145 in 2012 and @entity146 in 2008			0
its lighted spire went dark in 2005 when @entity149 died			0
it also turned bright red to mark the 60th anniversary of @entity62 in 2009			2
neither mayor de @entity3 's office nor the @entity11 responded to requests for comment .			2

@entity11 's 2016 convention site *selection* *committee* is in @entity10 and the light - up stunt is meant to curry favor
other cities on the @entity11 's short list are @entity82 and @entity80 , @entity79
the building 's spire lit up red and yellow for communist @entity62 's 60th anniversary in 2009
skyscraper 's website says it does *n't* award honorary lightings for political causes
parents of *children* who died of cancer are seeing their request for a one - night cancer - *research* acknowledgement fall on deaf ears
