@entity0 insists the @entity2 rainy season can not blow @entity5 's @entity4 preparations off course			1
@entity0 is one of the two specialists , alongside four all - rounders for this seven - match one - day international series , in a seam attack which is relatively inexperienced in the injury - enforced absence of @entity12 and @entity13			1
but the 28 - year - old , speaking after @entity5 's second practice session of the tour , is confident both he and his team - mates will rise to the challenge and will have ample opportunity to do so - despite the threat of curtailment from daily storms here			1
@entity0 ( above ) does not believe that the @entity2 rainy season will cause a huge problem for @entity5 @entity5 captain @entity24 ( above ) goes through his paces in the nets as @entity5 prepare to play @entity2 wicketkeeper and batsman @entity27 ( above ) takes a catch in the @entity5 training session the established weather pattern puts day - night matches - of which there are four - in particular peril , because rain clouds routinely build up by teatime			1
five reserve days are available , but if current conditions persists - as many expect - even they may not be enough to allow for 100 overs			2
before then , @entity5 have to dodge the storms too in practice and then two warm - up matches on friday and sunday			1
sawdust for the bowlers was much in evidence to help the bowlers at the @entity48 nets on wednesday			0
but @entity0 said : ' being @entity50 , we 're all used to a bit of rain			2
so that does n't bother anyone really			0
' turning up and having slightly damp footholds is not something any of us are fazed by			0
' @entity58 ( right ) hands out advice to team - mates @entity61 ( centre ) and @entity63 ( left ) @entity5 cricket coach @entity64 ( right ) talks to bowler @entity65 ( left ) in training extreme humidity is another occupational hazard with which he can happily cope			1
' it is quite warm , ' said @entity0			2
' but most of the guys have been over here in march - april time , when it is really stinking hot			0
' this feels relatively pleasant compared to that , so we 're okay with it			0
' as for the further outlook , @entity0 has no doubt he and his fellow @entity4 hopefuls will beat the weather to state their case for inclusion in the squad down under early next year			2
@entity63 ( centre ) bats in the nets as team - mate @entity27 looks on during @entity5 training @entity88 was also pictured in the nets as @entity5 prepare for a seven - match odi series in @entity2 ' most of the @entity91 have reserve days , so i think we 'll probably get a conclusion in most of if not all the games , ' he said			1
' if there are shorter games , it gives us the opportunity to go out there and maybe approach it with a different tactic			0
' you 're going to get presented with circumstances like that in @entity105			0
so why not be prepared for it ? '			0

@entity5 are in @entity2 on tour ahead of the @entity4 in *february*
