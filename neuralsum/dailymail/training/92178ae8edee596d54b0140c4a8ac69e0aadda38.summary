by @entity0 published : 08:46 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 09:53 est , 22 november 2012 the biggest penguins alive today : an @entity2 stands on sea ice near @entity4 , @entity5			1
they can reach heights of 3ft 11in tall a penguin that stood taller than most men waddled across the @entity12 millions of years ago , scientists say			2
@entity14 experts have discovered the fossils of a 6ft 6in ( 2m ) tall penguin that lived in prehistoric @entity5 34million years ago			1
paleontologists with the @entity20 of @entity22 province , near the capital @entity18 , said the remains were found on the icy southern continent			0
' this is the largest penguin known to date in terms of height and body mass , ' said researcher @entity29			0
the modern day record is held by emperor penguins , which reach heights of about 3ft 11in			1
lead researcher @entity33 added that the find will ' allow for a more intensive and complex study of the ancestors of modern penguins			2
' the previous record for the tallest prehistoric penguins had been held by a five foot tall bird discovered in @entity41 two years ago and nicknamed the water king			1
the water king , which lived more than 36million years ago , was found by a @entity41 student in the @entity46 on @entity41 's eastern coastline			0
like the latest find , it lived at a time half way between the end of the dinosaurs and the modern day when the @entity54 was much warmer than now and when when gigantic prehistoric birds and mammals roamed the world			2
as the @entity60 divorce rate continues to soar , a new study has today shown how marital harmony is thriving in the penguin world			0

the couple have remained loyal to each other over a 16 - year period , in spite of spending thousands of miles apart during their winter trips			0
the findings come after a 30 - year study of the breed where researchers placed metal identity bands on the flippers of 50,000 birds on the southern coast of @entity14			0
but unlike the @entity5 bird , and their modern day descendants , the flightless bird lived in the tropics - where it dived into warm seas using a seven - inch long spear - like beak to hunt for fish			1
in its next expedition to @entity5 , during the region â€™s summer , the @entity14 team will hunt for more fossils of the newly discovered species			1
they hope to gather more information about its anatomy and how the giant penguin might have moved			0
all the giant penguins that once roamed the prehistoric earth died out , leaving behind the smaller varieties which are today found only on the @entity5			1
previous finds from prehistoric penguins indicated they did not sport the iconic black and white feathers the birds are known for today , but had reddish - brown and grey plumage .			2

palaeontologists discovered fossils of the flightless bird in @entity5
new find beats previous record for biggest penguin by a foot and a half
the biggest penguins today are emperor penguins , which reach four foot
