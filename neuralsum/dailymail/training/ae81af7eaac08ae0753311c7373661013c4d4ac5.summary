' @entity6 , 73 , ordered a brightly coloured , cardboard coffin painted with flowers for her ' favourite ' aunt who died of brain cancer aged 90			1
but she was left stunned after bureaucrats at @entity13 , @entity14 , told her that the eco-friendly coffins were banned from the crematorium			1
@entity6 , pictured right , had planned to have her aunt @entity18 , pictured left , cremated in a cardboard coffin painted with flowers the grandmother - of - three has been left feeling that she has failed her beloved aunt , @entity18 , who cared greatly about the environment			1
@entity6 , who is arranging the february 5 funeral from her home in @entity25 as she is fighting her own battle with breast cancer , reluctantly is having her auntie cremated in a wooden box			1
' i ordered a beautiful floral cardboard coffin only to be told that the council wo n't allow it , ' she said			1
penpushers at @entity35 have banned cardboard coffins from their crematorium over safety concerns ' how appalling that a wooden coffin has to be used for a cremation whereas a cardboard one is more ecologically sound			1
' i just ca n't understand why they would think that cardboard is dangerous			0
' i thought a lovely , floral cardboard coffin would be super for my aunt , who loved colour and flowers , but sadly i am having to order a plain ordinary wooden one			1
i am very upset about it			0
@entity51 conscious @entity18 , 90 , died after a battle with brain cancer ' this was the last act i was going to do for my aunt and i fell i have failed her			1
' the floral cardboard coffin is thought to be similar to the one @entity57 character @entity56 was buried in on the beloved @entity59 soap			2
a spokesman for the council explained that the borough outlawed the eco-friendly boxes after carrying out a ' risk assessment '			2
he said : ' the differences in structure and cremating properties of paper product coffins led to a risk assessment being carried out			1
' during the cremation process , paper - based materials handle and combust differently to other products			0
' fly ash and residue can also interfere with out emission treatment and monitoring systems , which are in place to ensure we meet stringent emission limit laid down by the @entity81			0
' as a result , and to ensure continued safe operation of the facility , the council took the decision not to accept paper product coffins for cremation			0
' but if a relative is looking for an eco-friendly alternative , then bamboo boxes can be used , he added			0
cardboard coffins were once seen as a flimsy , cheap option that lacked dignity			2
but in the last few years , as environmental awareness has grown , more and more people are turning to the relatively inexpensive casket as eco-friendly and modern alternative			0
a quarter of people , who took part in a @entity105 survey , said they would go for a more eco friendly cardboard coffin			2
they can be bought for as little as Â£ 60 and can come in a huge range of colours and designs			0
they can also be personalised and can be turned into anything from planes			0
most standard cardboard coffins can hold a person of around 23 stone in weight , but many companies can supply stronger ones if necessary			2
cardboard coffins are also bio-degradable and are said to be suitable for burials and cremations .			0
