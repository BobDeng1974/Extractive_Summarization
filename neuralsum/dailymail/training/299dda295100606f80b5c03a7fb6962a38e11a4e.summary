gp @entity0 told an un-named patient that she should stop taking medication as @entity4 was her surgeon according to a fitness to practice hearing a @entity8 gp performed an exorcism on a seriously ill patient after promising he could ' heal ' her without medication , a medical tribunal heard			1
dr @entity0 , 56 , persuaded the mother - of - one to undergo the spiritual procedure at his local pentecostal church after telling her : ' @entity4 is your surgeon , ' it was claimed			1
during a four month period leading to the ceremony , dr @entity0 subjected the patient who was in great pain after stomach surgery to ' religious grooming ' in which he said the ' devil was having a real go at her ' and that she had ' devil items ' in her house , it was alleged			1
the doctor further exploited her vulnerability by quoting the @entity35 at her , taking her to religious meetings , praying with her at home and even programming her television remote to satellite tv 's @entity39 , it was said			2
dr @entity0 and his wife @entity41 , 62 , also gave the woman a copy of a book he had written with his wife called the @entity46 and got her to meet the local pastor over lunch at a restaurant			1
the couple later pressurised the woman into a signing a document called the @entity54 , the @entity52 was told			0
the patient who was also severely depressed became convinced she had been possessed by demons and all her troubles were because of the devil			0
she was told to stop taking anti depressants and blood pressure medication and allegedly warned not to tell her psychiatrist as dr @entity0 claimed they were ' very dangerous			1
' she later told her psychiatrist who subsequently reported him to the @entity64			2
at a fitness to practise hearing in @entity67 dr @entity0 , from @entity68 , @entity69 , faced misconduct charges which include using his professional position to influence the patient 's religious beliefs			1
it is also claimed his actions caused ' distress ' to the woman and was ' detrimental ' to her health			0
the woman - known as @entity82 - had been prescribed anti depressants , anti hypertensive and analgesic medication and was said to be suicidal and in great pain after colostomy surgery			0
she met the @entity1 in august 2012 when he was a locum at @entity90 in the @entity91 in @entity68			0
@entity92 , counsel for the @entity64 , said : ' she first consulted dr @entity0 by telephone when she was in great pain , depressed and suicidal			1
in the course of that telephone consultation dr @entity0 asked her if she had a faith and she said she did n't he told her his wife knew of a different way that could heal her that did not involve medication			1
dr @entity0 was working as a locum gp at the @entity101 at the @entity91 , pictured ' later that same day dr @entity0 telephoned @entity82 and his wife @entity41 spoke to her			1
the following day dr @entity0 went to her home and started to talk to her about @entity4			1
' on that occasion he also programmed the television to the @entity39			0
' dr @entity0 and his wife also invited patient a for lunch with them and their friends at a local restaurant			1
' one of the friends present was a pastor at the church			0
dr @entity0 and his wife befriended and attempted to evangelise patient a. they often prayed with her and took her to meetings where she took part in religious practices			1
' mr @entity92 said that @entity82 - and other members of her family - were also given numerous religious gifts , including the @entity46 and was offered the use of a log cabin			0
' it was compiled and written by @entity127 and @entity128 , ' he said			0
' together with that document they included a document called @entity54 , which they pressurised her , particularly the doctor 's wife , to sign			2
' she has said the doctor advised her that for religious reasons she should stop taking her medication and not go to see the psychiatrist			1
when he saw him he advised her that there is a better way			0
he is linked to the pentecostal church			0
' he and his wife took her to a meeting and at that meeting she was advised against seeing a psychiatrist , that god was her surgeon and she should stop her medication			2
they also offered her an exorcism and performed it			0
she was made to feel as if all things going wrong were due to the devil			0
' ' from documents provided by @entity158 it appears he and his wife 's relationship with @entity82 was based solely on @entity8 principles whereas @entity82 believes the gifts and acts of kindness amounted to a form of religious grooming designed to cause division within her family - particularly herself and her partner , and caused her great distress			2
' the woman rang dr @entity0 at the surgery in @entity68 , pictured , and he asked whether she had any faith she later told her psychiatrist of the doctor 's conduct , who in turn wrote a letter to the @entity64 and an investigation commenced			1
when dr @entity0 , who qualified as a doctor from the @entity184 in 1982 , heard about the allegations , he filed a complaint to the @entity64 about the psychiatrist 's conduct in reporting the matter but the case was quickly dismissed			1
an initial report claimed the patient was subjected to a four - hour ' testimony ' in january 2013 where an exorcism was performed and she claimed dr @entity0 specifically told her not to tell her psychiatrist about the meetings - because they ' do the devil 's work '			1
the gp is said to have further told her that if she told the @entity64 ' she would be cursed '			2
the patient ignored this advice and complained to both - after she broke down about her treatment and first told her psychiatrist who then rang a confidential helpline to report her allegations			2
dr @entity0 later denied all of the accusations , calling them ' attacks ' on his ' private @entity8 faith and life ' and insisting he was a lay bible teacher he accepts visiting @entity82 's home shortly after their first consultation , but refutes the allegations against him over the alleged exorcism			1
he did not attend the hearing but in a letter said that he has already resigned from medicine			2
he said : ' i know what went on and what my wife and i did or did not do			0
even if they [ @entity64 ] did side with me , i know true justice will be done one day and no - one can escape from that			2
' the allegations have been severe enough to break anyone down emotionally and i 'm grateful for my faith which sustained me throughout the ordeal			0
' i forgive the patient and her husband and also the psychiatrist for the horrendous allegations against my wife and me			1
we are enjoying living a quiet private life and we are able to help many more people than i would have done by staying in the @entity239			0
@entity4 knows everything and will judge fairly			0
' the case continues .			0
