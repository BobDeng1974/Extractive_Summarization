after serving eight years of a 14 - year prison sentence for attempting to blow up @entity8 police officers with pipe bombs in the 1970s , a former member of the @entity1 - the group of domestic , left - wing ' terrorists ' best known for kidnapping newspaper heiress @entity4 - is talking to reporters , and has revealed that , at age 66 , she is now a grandmother			1
until now , @entity11 - better known as bank - robbing pipe - bomber @entity11 - has done her best to stay out of the public eye			2
following her release from a @entity16 prison in 2009 , @entity11 has been living with her husband in @entity18 , @entity19 , where she lived as a fugitive with her family for nearly 25 years until her arrest in 1999			1
@entity11 is n't saying much about her past , or her new role as a grandmother - she 's more interested in spreading the word about her new cause : reducing disparities in prison sentences for crack and powder cocaine			1
grandmother : @entity11 , left , works with her daughter @entity33 , right , the former radical was part of the @entity1 who kidnapped @entity4 ' i do n't really like to talk about my personal experience in terms of my family and all that , ' @entity11 said in an interview on friday			1
' but when i was [ in prison ] , at some point i did adjust to it and i said , ' i have to learn something from this			0
' @entity11 joined the @entity1 in the mid- 1970s after graduating from the @entity47			2
in 1974 , she was a member of the group when it kidnapped @entity50 to use as a bargaining chip with authorities in an attempt to get jailed @entity1 members released from custody			2
in april 1975 , @entity11 was one of several @entity1 members who robbed @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity16			1
during the robbery , @entity59 - a 42 - year - old mother of four who was dropping off money for her church - was murdered			0
additionally , @entity50 later told police that @entity11 had kicked a pregnant woman in the stomach during the robbery , causing her to have a miscarriage			2
different times : once a fugitive for attempting to blow up @entity8 police officers , @entity11 - now known as @entity11 - is a grandmother @entity11 pictured as a student radical in the @entity74 four months after the bank robbery , in august of 1975 , @entity11 placed a pipe - bomb under an @entity78 cruiser as it sat parked in front of an @entity81 restaurant			1
another pipe - bomb was found under an @entity78 cruiser parked in front of a police precinct			2
neither bomb detonated , and both were linked back to @entity11 , who police believe planted the bombs in an effort to avenge the death of @entity1 members who 'd been killed about a year earlier during a shootout with police			1
as an @entity78 officer noted during @entity11 's 2002 sentencing hearing , a little girl was playing near the patrol car when the bomb was left underneath it , and she could have been killed if @entity11 and her co-conspirators had ' successfully carried out their terrorist acts			1
' after being indicted for the failed bombings , @entity11 relocated to @entity19 and changed her name to @entity11			2
she married a doctor and had three children - and was active in the ' progressive ' community			0
in 1999 , after appearing on @entity108 multiple times , @entity11 was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder , possession of explosives , explosion , and attempt to ignite an explosive with intent to murder			0
she pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder			0
the other charges were dropped			0
justice delayed : @entity11 was arrested in 1999 on a 23 - year - old warrant charging her with planting pipe bombs under police cars in @entity8 in 1975 while a member of the @entity1 now , @entity11 has returned to activism and - along with friend and next - door neighbor , @entity127 - filed a @entity129 petition thursday asking the president to exercise executive clemency for prisoners serving time under now - discarded sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine			1
in 2010 , @entity135 cut those sentences to align more closely with those for powder cocaine , but that only applied to new sentences going forward			1
the women 's petition says that left more than 5,000 prisoners still serving time longer than the new rules would require			0
' @entity147 ' : this infamous photo shows newspaper heiress @entity4 wielding a gun during a bank robbery in @entity16 in 1975 ' there 's just no good argument for that continuing to be the case , so we said let 's see what we can do , ' said @entity127 , a retired attorney who moved into the house next door while @entity11 was in prison			1
the petition was @entity127 's idea , and one of @entity11 's adult daughters is helping.the interview occurred in @entity127 's living room ; @entity11 , now 66 , looks fit , with long white hair and a deeply lined face			0
she is quick with statistics and opinions about the cause			0
' @entity171 is a politically convenient peg on which to hang a lot of things , and that has been done by a lot of politicians , ' @entity11 said			0
she and @entity127 , as many critics have done , said the differences in crack and powder cocaine sentences stem from stereotypes of crack as a drug for poor black people while powder cocaine is for rich white people			1
bargaining chip : @entity4 was kidnapped by members of the @entity1			1
she ultimately helped the ' terrorist ' group commit multiple crimes in the petition , the women ask the @entity129 to establish a panel to review individual cases of the prisoners in question , and then make recommendations to president @entity198 about which of them deserve to be released			0
that would mimic the 1974 process by which president @entity202 commuted sentences of large numbers of @entity206 draft @entity207 can file a petition to the @entity129 , but it requires 100,000 signatures in 30 days to trigger an actual @entity129 review			2
and that 's no guarantee of action , either			0
@entity11 and @entity127 are trying to circulate it widely in activist circles , and have posted it on @entity216 , an online petition platform			0
two days after its posting , the petition â€” one of more than 100 on the @entity129 site @entity221 / was nearing 100 signatures			0
soldier : ' @entity11 , ' former member of the @entity1 , seen here in her mugshot just prior to her release from prison comrades : the @entity1 wreaked havoc on @entity16 in the mid- 1970s			1

@entity11 and members of the @entity1 are best known for kidnapping newspaper heiress @entity4
