a new analysis shows that only 1 in 8 families could afford the cost of living what 's commonly known as the @entity4 in 2014			1
inspired by the new book ' chasing the @entity4 , ' about the cost of the financial crisis , housing bubble , and @entity9 , reporters at @entity11 calculated the cost of all those elements that make up the @entity4			1
for the project they included the costs of home ownership , moderate - cost groceries , a car , health insurance , taxes , educational expenses for your children , and retirement planning			1
a new study shows only one family in eight can afford home ownership , children , retirement savings , and all the other things typically promised in the @entity4 they reached an average total of $ 130,357 per year in household income			1
here 's how @entity11 broke down the average expenses to live comfortably and raise children : home ownership - $ 17,062 per year groceries - $ 12,659 for a family of four transportation - $ 11,039 a year for a four - wheel - drive suv health care - an average of $ 9,144 for out - of - pocket costs and premiums total taxes - roughly 30 per cent of all income education - $ 4,000 per year for two children plus approximately $ 2,500 per child for college savings retirement - the maximum pretax contribution to a retirement plan for people under 50 in this income level is approximately $ 17,500 in a country where the median household income is roughly $ 51,000 , that 's a dream well out of reach for most people			1
in fact only 16 million households in @entity64 earned that much last year			2
@entity66 , a professor at @entity67 who co-authored the book , noted that most people surveyed did not desire to become one of the 1 per cent of earners , only to have a decent life			2
' it 's not about getting rich and making a lot of money			2
it 's about security , ' he said			0
he added that they also wanted to see their children succeed			0
' they want to feel that their children are going to have a better life than they do , ' @entity66 added			0
there are however massive variables depending on where one lives , with cities like @entity89 and @entity90 being far more affordable than @entity91 or @entity92 when you take taxes and housing costs into account			0
they also noted that some groups - immigrants for instance - often lived with extended families that helped share the load			0
some business owners are even beginning to publicly speak out			0
recently , @entity105 ceo @entity104 announced a policy to help provide a college education for his employees			0
' in the last few years , we have seen the fracturing of the @entity4 , ' he told reporters			1
and studies show more @entity64 understand their situations			0
a 2008 @entity115 poll showed roughly three - quarters of @entity64 said that the @entity4 was harder to attain .			1

@entity11 calculated the cost by adding expenses including home ownership , children , groceries , retirement planning , and health care
it 's estimated only 1 in 8 households can afford the @entity4
fewer families believe the dream is in their reach , according to recent survey
