horrific : @entity17 has captured shocking images of seals being clubbed to death on @entity4 's ice floes ( pictured ) as this year 's ' commercial hunt ' gets underway cruel : images show the animals - who are eventually skinned for their fur - being shot and wounded on the thin ice before being dragged ( pictured ) onto vessels chilling : the seals who do not die from the gunshot wounds are dragged onto ships ( pictured ) where they are clubbed to death gruesome : the baby animals ( pictured ) are suffering a violent death ' for fur products nobody wants ' according to @entity17 inhumane : some seals die from the gunshot wounds ( top ) while others escape into the water where they slowly die from their injuries ( bottom ) blood - stained : once the animals are shot , sealers retrieve the bodies by impaling them with a sharpened hook ( pictured ) which forces the seals that are still alive to violently thrash out cruel : the images @entity18 took from a helicopter above @entity16 's ice floes show sealers ( pictured ) pulling the seal 's blood - stained carcasses onto their ship the disturbing images show the animals thrashing in pain as they are pulled across the blood - stained snow while others are seen impaled on the boat 's deck			1
@entity18 's executive director @entity69 said : ' this is the 17th year that i have witnessed the seal slaughter			0
the suffering i have seen is impossible to forget			0
if the killing happened in view of the public , it would have been shut down decades ago			0
but it occurs far offshore			0
' we saw one baby seal clearly raise her head from the massive pool of blood she lay in			0
another was shot and thrashed on the ice only to slip into the blood - slicked water			0
' it is reprehensible that these baby seals are being killed with government financing , even as the largest seal processor in @entity4 admits to warehousing a stockpile of seal fur			2
' the @entity16 government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 harp , hooded and grey seals , according to @entity18			1
they claim the seals - many of which are just a few weeks old - are shot , clubbed and skinned for their fur despite a decreasing global demand for them			1
killing : even sir @entity106 who visited a seal nursery with @entity18 in 2006 has made an emotional plea for @entity4 to stop the seal hunt ( pictured ) @entity110 : the animals are slaughtered in a remote region off the coast of @entity16 ( pictured ) - @entity18 says if the killing happened in view of the public ' it would have been shut down decades ago ' brutal : veterinary experts claim the seals are killed inhumanely in the commercial hunt ( pictured ) because of the harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which they are killed barbaric : @entity18 's executive director says ' it is reprehensible that these baby seals ( pictured ) are being killed with government financing ' demand : the country 's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase the fur from seals who are killed and skinned ( pictured ) during commercial hunts innocent : government reports found 98 percent of the seals ( pictured ) killed in the @entity4 commercial seal slaughter are less than three months of age , according to @entity18 the demand for seal products diminished greatly after the @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and the @entity147 of @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 banned the trade of some or all products of commercial seal hunts			1
with @entity157 also blocking attempts to import seal meat into the country , the price of seal products from @entity4 declined rapidly and convinced many ' sealers ' to abandon the act			1
sir @entity106 who visited a seal nursery with @entity18 in 2006 has made an emotional plea for @entity4 to stop the seal hunt			1
the former @entity166 said : ' @entity4 's brutal commercial seal hunt has begun , and once again thousands of baby seals will be shot and bludgeoned to make fur products that nobody wants or needs			1
' videos of the bloody seal slaughter provide the only vital evidence to demonstrate year after year that these seals are dying a horrible death for their fur			2
' in recent years , @entity16 's government has reportedly dished out £ 6million in subsidies to seal processing plants to ' prop up the dying industry ' - and announced a further £ 1.3million earlier this month			1
' it is a double tragedy , ' according to @entity18 spokesperson @entity183 who told @entity184 : ' they [ seals ] are suffering for frivolous fur products and @entity4 ca n't even sell the fur because more and more countries around the world are boycotting sales because of the horrendous cruelty			2
' ' we want the @entity4 government to offer a buy - out to the sealers and put and end to this senseless slaughter			0
' the hunt is legal but that does n't mean that the killing is always done according to what few guidelines govern the industry and @entity18 has frequently documented breaches			0
' even if they did always kill the seals according to the rules , it 's still a dreadfully brutal process ... this hunt is taking place many hundreds of miles out with absolutely no - one there to monitor what they 're doing			0
' immoral : even though the hunt ( pictured ) is legal in @entity4 , animal rights campaigners say it 's still a dreadfully brutal process shocking : the @entity16 government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 seals ( pictured ) this year , despite declining global demand for their fur hunted : the boss of a company who accepted government funds to continue purchasing sealskin said ' it 's probably not a really good time to get in this industry ' death : as many as half - a - million seals ( pictured ) will be hunted and killed in this year 's cull only this week the country 's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase seal fur , citing a lack of demand and a warehouse full of it			1
@entity241 also refused over £ 600,000 in financing from the @entity16 government			2
but a new company @entity243 is accepting government funds and has stated it will purchase around 30,000 seal furs , according to @entity246			2
the firm 's chief executive told the news channel ' the markets are n't really great around the world ... it 's probably not a really good time to get in this industry			0
' government reports confirmed that 98 percent of the seals killed in the @entity4 commercial seal slaughter are pups less than three months of age , according to @entity18			0
veterinary experts have stated that @entity4 's commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane because of the remote , harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which the killing is conducted for commercial and safety reasons .			0
