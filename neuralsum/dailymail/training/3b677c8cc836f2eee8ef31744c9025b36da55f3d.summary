the man in charge of the six - month inquiry , former @entity18 chief justice @entity17 , says mr @entity8 did not receive a fair trial and was denied a fair chance of acquittal			1
and so , in an extraordinary twist , it has been recommended that mr @entity8 be freed			0
' the verdict was reached in circumstances where significant material was not disclosed by the prosecution , critical evidence was seriously flawed , evidence of a threat to kill was not properly tested , ' justice @entity17 says in a 477 - page report released on friday			2
the @entity39 tried to stop the report being released on friday but failed			0
overturned : his conviction was quashed because there was a substantial miscarriage of justice at his trial mr @entity10 ( left ) was shot dead in the driveway of his @entity16 home in january 1989 and @entity8 's lawyer @entity49 ( right ) leaves the @entity50 in @entity16 , friday , may 30 ' for these reasons i recommend that the conviction of the applicant on november 3 , 1995 , for the murder of the deceased be quashed , ' justice @entity17 concluded			1
despite finding many problems with the trial , justice @entity17 believes mr @entity8 , an angry sacked public servant , committed the crime			1
' i am fairly certain that the applicant is guilty of the murder of the deceased , but a nagging doubt remains , ' he says			0
however , the substantial miscarriage of justice should not be allowed to stand uncorrected , he says			0
mr @entity10 was shot dead on a summer 's evening by his @entity16 home in january 1989 , a hit initially blamed on @entity65 organised crime figures he had been investigating			1
