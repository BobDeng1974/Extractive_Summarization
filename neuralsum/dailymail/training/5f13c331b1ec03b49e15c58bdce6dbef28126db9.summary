savagely beaten , stabbed and forced to participate in dog fights , the first four years of @entity1 the @entity4 mongrel 's life were nothing short of hellish			1
but after being picked up by a convoy of @entity8 soldiers on the streets of @entity10 , @entity4 , @entity1 was given the veterinary care he needed before being flown to the @entity8			1
now , two years after his arrival , he has found a loving new home , triumphed in the mongrel category at @entity15 - and is the ' author ' of his very own autobiography			2
' his whole life has been about survival so he never really had a chance to play and be a puppy when he was one , ' she explains			0
' now the puppy in him has come out			0
' born in @entity10 , @entity1 , five , was just two years old when he first came to the attention of @entity8 servicemen patrolling the streets			1
rescued from a crowd intent on beating him with chunks of wood , he was taken back to base where he was patched up by an @entity48 medic			2
but days after being sent back onto the streets , he was back after dog - fighters hacked off his ears , before cutting his muzzle open			1
brutalised : @entity1 was so badly hurt when he was first picked up , vets did n't expect him to survive in pain : @entity1 , pictured immediately after his rescue , had been stabbed and had his ears lopped off founded by @entity57 in 2006 , @entity55 , named after the first dog he ever rescued , specialises in rescuing and rehoming street dogs and cats in @entity4			1
their kennel in @entity61 is the country 's only dog shelter and the animals who are taken in are chipped and have blood samples taken as soon as they arrive			2
if a home with a caring local family can not be found , these samples are then passed on to the @entity8 and @entity71 authorities before the animals are flown out to begin a four month quarantine period ( 30 days in the @entity71 )			1
most go on to live with the soldiers who first found them with more than 650 servicemen reunited with their @entity4 pets since the charity opened			1
along with the @entity8 and @entity71 , pets have been rehomed in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , the @entity83 and @entity84			1
recent travellers include @entity86 , a ginger cat sent to the @entity71 in february for a new life with the @entity71 soldier who found her , and @entity91 who was flown to the @entity8 for adoption in january			1
for more information , see @entity94 he was again patched up only to return with new injuries that included a stab wound to the chest and a severed tail			0
finally , after thugs threw him under a car , the @entity48 female soldier started planning to take him home , only to be denied a permit by the @entity105 government			0
luckily , @entity57 , 44 , the founder of @entity55 , a charity that has so far sent more than 550 @entity4 street dogs to loving new homes in the @entity8 and @entity71 , was able to step in			2
months after being found beaten and bleeding in the streets of @entity10 , @entity1 was flown to the @entity8 and put into quarantine in a @entity20 kennel			1
and it was there that @entity1 was first introduced to the woman who would later give him a home , @entity55 volunteer , ms @entity19			1
' i wanted to see him mainly just because of his background , ' she explains			0
' but he was just so trusting and so lovely - it made me almost want to go and apologise for what had happened to him			2
' by the time @entity1 came home , he had been in quarantine for seven months and had fully recovered from his injuries - leaving him free to enjoy his new life of walks , cuddles and play with ms @entity19 's two other dogs			1
' he loves sleeping and he likes jumping on tables , sitting in windows and watching the world go by - he loves being up high , ' she smiles			0
' he goes out for his walks and he even went to the @entity136 mayor 's garden party the other day			2
he 's a bit of a local celebrity and a lot of people come up in the street and say , " oh , is that @entity1 ? " ' but with new book @entity1 : the @entity143 who would n't @entity144 launched next week , @entity1 's life is about to get busy - something ms @entity19 says she 's happy to accept if it means more money for @entity55 and more brutalised canines helped			1
trusting : despite his horrendous experiences , @entity19 says @entity1 still adores people , in particular , men winning : @entity1 also triumphed in in the mongrel category at @entity15 and is the subject of a new book proud : @entity19 says she is enormously proud of @entity1 , seen here with his winner 's rosette she also wants to see more support for the work done on the ground in @entity4 where , she says , @entity55 are working to change local attitudes towards dogs			1
' it 's whole different culture , ' she explains			0
' it 's completely different from here where we 're brought up to care for animals			0
' we find it shocking but to them it is normal			0
they 're scared of rabies , the @entity174 outlawed dogs and made it an offence to be nice to them and the dogs are also feral : they spread disease and stuff like that			0
' @entity55 are working hard to change that attitude and people are starting to pick up injured dogs and puppies and are bringing them into @entity55 which never happened before			0
' as for @entity1 himself , ms @entity19 says he seems none the worse for his experiences , with the only hint of his past life being an unusually high tolerance for loud noises			1
' there must be a lot going on in his head at times but outwardly , he 's so trusting and you would never know what had happened , ' she says			0
' he 's completely unfazed wherever he goes , bangs and fireworks do n't bother him at all even though most other dog are terrified of them			0
' he loves everyone and he loves men especially even though it was men who hurt him			0
he 's really affectionate with everyone			0
' @entity1 also has a loving home for life			2
' he 's never going anywhere , ' insists ms @entity19			2
' it was never meant to be permanent - i was supposed to foster him and give him a taste of normal life for three months - but i could n't bear to be parted from him now			0
' @entity1 : the @entity218 is published by @entity219 on the 11th september , priced at Â£ 14.99 new lease of life : a happy @entity1 at home in the @entity20 town of @entity136 ( left ) and his new biography ( right )			1
