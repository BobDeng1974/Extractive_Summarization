@entity2 's biggest firms owe the taxman up to £ 25.5billion , but are regularly let off the hook , mps say today			1
the sum is equivalent to £ 1,000 for every @entity2 family - or the equivalent of 6p being cut from the basic rate of income tax			1
while families , shopkeepers and small businesses are forced to pay their bills in full , big businesses are striking favourable deals and have an ' far too cosy ' relationship with @entity17			1
the £ 25.5bn is @entity17 's own ' ballpark estimate ' of the maximum tax liabilities of big businesses they are having their tax bills cut or managing to avoid paying interest			1
@entity24 , the out - going @entity17 chief executive , was wined and dined 107 times by big firms ' tax lawyers and advisors between 2007 and 2009 , the report revealed			1
@entity29 , @entity30 chairman of the @entity31 , accused the tax office of hiding behind a ' veil of secrecy ' to keep deals private			1
she said the panel of mps had to rely on a whistleblower and a private eye to find out about the questionable deals			0
a controversial deal struck by @entity42 which allowed them to avoid paying up to £ 20million would never have come to light if it had not been for the insider			1
unlike millions of hard - up taxpayers , @entity24 ( pictured ) will never struggle to find money to pay his bills , or face the choice between heating and eating			2
the 60 - year - old permanent secretary at @entity17 , pictured , is due to retire next summer on between £ 75,000 and £ 80,000 a year , and will also get a lump sum of between £ 160,000 and £ 165,000			1
when he retires , he may miss the programme of corporate hospitality that he has enjoyed during his time at @entity17			2
between 2007 and 2009 , he was entertained 107 times , mostly at breakfasts , lunches and dinners , by banks and law and accountancy firms			1
in total , the report says , @entity17 is seeking to resolve more than 2,700 issues with the biggest companies , including disputes over outstanding tax , with potential tax at stake of £ 25.5billion			1
it said : ‘ we have serious concerns that large companies are treated more favourably by @entity17 than other taxpayers			2
’ it criticises the department ’s ‘ specific and systemic failures ’			0
campaign group @entity77 have vowed to pursue firms for unpaid tax through the courts			2
mrs @entity29 , speaking on @entity82 's today programme , said this morning that they discovered a lack of accountability			2
‘ this is a bit like @entity88 , ' she said			0
' the big companies have very expensive lawyers and advisors			1
@entity17 have very few people who have in - depth knowledge of tax affairs			1
‘ there is no dissociation between those who negotiate and authorise them ( the deals )			0
' they hide behind a veil of secrecy claiming taxpayer confidentiality so there is no accountability as to whether these deals provide good value for money			0
’ she accused @entity17 of striking ‘ sweetheart ’ deals with big businesses which would be denied to hard - working families , shopkeepers and small businesses			1
mrs @entity29 said the panel had to rely on the testimony of a whistleblower as well as a private eye in a situation she described as ‘ very unconscionable '			1
banking giant @entity42 was allowed to skip a multi-million pound interest bill on unpaid tax on bonuses after outgoing chief executive @entity24 was wrongly advised there was a ' legal impediment ' to collecting it			1
the potential cost to the taxpayer is officially put at £ 8million but the committee was given evidence from a whistleblower that the sum could be as high as £ 20million			2
in its report the @entity134 expressed astonishment that @entity17 ' chose to depart from normal governance procedures ' by allowing the same senior officials to both negotiate and approve such deals			2
worse , it said , the @entity42 deal was done ' without legal advice ' or an official note being taken of the meeting , with officials relying on the firm 's records			1
@entity29 , @entity30 chairman of the committee , says the report , published today , is ‘ a damning indictment of @entity17 ’			1
scathing : @entity29 , @entity30 chairman of the @entity31 , said the report is a ' damning indictment of @entity17 ' she is particularly critical of the refusal by the department ’s executives to answer questions from @entity134 about details of its dealings with big business			1
they insisted that there were issues of confidentiality , but mrs @entity29 dismissed these claims , saying they are using ‘ a cloak to protect the department from scrutiny ’			2
the report says executives , such as the mr @entity24 , gave ‘ imprecise , inconsistent and potentially misleading answers ’ , and states : ‘ this situation is entirely unacceptable			0
’ it warns : ‘ the department has left itself open to suspicion that its relationship with large companies is too cosy			0
’ the £ 25.5billion is @entity17 ’s own ‘ ballpark estimate ’ of the maximum potential tax liabilities of big businesses , calculated before any proper investigation has taken place			1
the figure can be dramatically cut by a business legitimately applying for a relief , or being able to offset a tax liability against a loss made in the previous financial year			0
the report is published days after mr @entity24 , 60 , announced his plans to retire next year following a barrage of criticism surrounding his running of the department			0
he will not be leaving empty - handed			0
he stands to scoop a pension which is currently worth between £ 75,000 and £ 80,000 a year			0
this gold - plated sum will be paid after mr @entity24 has taken a lump sum of between £ 160,000 and £ 165,000 from his £ 1.7million pension pot. the report is critical of his attendance at a ‘ significant ’ number of lunches and dinners ‘ with large companies with whom @entity17 was settling complex tax disputes ’			1
@entity210 said : ‘ ordinary taxpayers often feel that they are treated harshly when they make genuine mistakes because of our complicated tax system			0
‘ this report will increase suspicions that big businesses are treated differently			0
’ some of the big business settlements are currently the subject of a separate investigation by the government ’s spending watchdog , the @entity223			0
@entity17 has been responsible for a catalogue of errors recently			0
around 6million taxpayers are currently getting letters saying they have over-paid , and can expect to get back £ 400 each , equal to £ 2.5billion			0
around 1.2million others are being told they need to pay an average of £ 600 more			0
yesterday an @entity17 spokesman rejected the @entity134 ’ report , saying it was based on ‘ partial information , inaccurate opinion and some misunderstanding of facts ’			0
he said the £ 25.5billion figure was ‘ a ballpark estimate of maximum potential tax liabilities ’			0
it is not ‘ actual tax ’ that is owed or unpaid			0
he added : ‘ in many cases , when @entity17 has looked at the full facts , it becomes clear that there is no further liability at all			2
’ @entity246 , exchequer secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ the government has full confidence in @entity17 and its current leadership			2

6p could be cut from basic rate of tax if £ 25.5bn bill was paid in full
@entity17 has ' very few people ' with deep knowledge of tax affairs , says @entity29
@entity42 deal ' would never have come to light without whistleblower '
chief executive @entity24 had 107 lunches with big firms ' tax lawyers and advisors between 2007 and 2009
