by @entity0 @entity2 could have the highest levels of cocaine use of any city in @entity6 , a new report suggests			1
researchers tested the amount of a number of illegal substances in the waste water of cities across the continent in a bid to assess @entity6 's drug habits			1
they found @entity2 had the highest levels of cocaine of any of the 42 cities tested , well above that of other capitals including @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity2 's sewage water contained 711mg of benzoylecgonine , the main chemical in cocaine , per 1,000 people , compared to 393 in @entity21 , 243 in @entity22 and 233 in @entity28			1
levels in @entity2 's water were nearly double those recorded in a similar study two years ago , results show			2
the study , by the @entity34 - based @entity33 for @entity35 , also highlighted an apparent @entity38 divide in drugs used			0
while the populations of cities in @entity6 were more likely to cocaine , ecstasy and cannabis , @entity41 citizens are more likely to be developing a crystal meth habit			1
the research shows how levels of drugs in waste water rise and fall over the week			1
in @entity2 , the amount of cocaine in the water increases to 904mg on saturday , compared to a 799mg average on weekdays			0
the amount of crystal meth in the capital 's water trebles on a saturday and levels of ecstasy jump from 27mg per 1,000 people on a weekday to 69mg on a saturday			1
@entity63 had the highest levels of crystal meth in its water , at 327mg per 1,000 people , the @entity67 city of @entity68 the second highest and @entity69 in @entity70 the third highest			1
cannabis appears to be the drug of choice in @entity74 and southern @entity6 , with the highest levels recorded in @entity22 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
@entity79 government statistics state that around one in 12 adults used illegal drugs in 2012 , but only one in 50 took @entity85 drugs like cocaine			0

mr @entity87 said : ' while government data shows that powder cocaine use been falling since 2008/09 , it remains the second most commonly used illicit substance in the @entity79			2

cocaine is a powerful stimulant which may place strain on the heart			0
' when taken in large doses , people can experience extreme anxiety , paranoia and hallucinations and regular use can lead to dependence			0

' studies in the @entity79 , including figures from the independent @entity129 , show that drug usage remains at its lowest level since records began in 1996			0
' we will however continue to review new ideas and techniques as they are developed to ensure the @entity79 has robust systems in place to measure and track drug prevalence			0
' the report 's authors have defended the research , stating : ' waste water analysis provides the possibility to collect and report measurements more quickly and regularly than is the current norm for national surveys			2
' if used more routinely as a complement to other @entity41 drug surveillance methods , it has the clear potential to shed extra light on drug use trends in @entity6 , including the use of new psychoactive substances			0
' some experts have suggested the methods can actually be more accurate than studies based on questionnaires because those answering surveys are not always honest .			0
