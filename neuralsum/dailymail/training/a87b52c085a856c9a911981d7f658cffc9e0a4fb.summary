these @entity11 macaques , or snow monkeys , have taken to plunging into hot springs to protect themselves from the fierce , freezing conditions of the snowy highlands where they live			1
they learned of the benefits of the springs just 50 years ago , copying humans who bathed in the boiling water that bubbles out of crevices in the frozen ground in an area known as @entity27			1
@entity11 @entity29 baby enjoying a relaxing moment in a hot spring , in @entity32 , @entity11 in order to avoid clashes over the hot water , a special pool for the monkeys was built higher up in the valley , away from people			0
boasting its own waterfalls , soaking pool and resting ledges , the @entity40 in central @entity11 is now home to about 200 macaques			1
living in the icy @entity11 highlands , these monkeys have adopted a rather unusual pastime to keep warm - heading to the hot tub with their double layer of thick fur they are able to withstand temperatures as low as of minus 15 degrees centigrade			2
but when it is at its coldest the clever primates have a second line of defence - spending much of their days bathing in hot springs the warm - water dips are a useful second line of defence for the primates , who have a double layer of thick fur that enables them to withstand temperatures as low as -15c			0
the intelligent monkeys also make snowballs just for fun , and have been seen indulging in playful fights .			0
