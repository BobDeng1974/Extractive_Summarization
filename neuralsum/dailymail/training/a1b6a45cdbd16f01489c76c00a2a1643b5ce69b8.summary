by @entity0 last updated at 2:55 pm on 26th january 2012 the queen , pictured earlier this month in @entity2 , takes most of her flights from @entity4 defence chiefs could be forced to sell off the @entity1 's airfield as the @entity7 looks to slash budgets			1
the department is considering plans to sell @entity4 , which occupies hundreds of acres of prime real estate in @entity13 on the outskirts of north @entity15 , it has emerged			1
the site could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds to property developers			1
the plan is part of a wider review of @entity7 property and comes as the department is under severe pressure to cut its budgets			1
the @entity1 currently takes most of her flights from @entity4 , which is also home to the @entity25			1
and since june 1998 , @entity4 station commanders have served as aides - de - camp to her majesty			1
it is also understood there have been recent high - level discussions within @entity32 to discuss a plan which would see the base – where princess @entity36 ’s body was repatriated from @entity37 - used as a satellite airfield for @entity39 , rather than being developed			1
former defence chief air commodore @entity40 said it would be a great shame if the airfield was lost			0
he said defence cuts had already forced the @entity44 to lose historic bases , and questioned whether it was necessary to add @entity4 to the list			1
he told the @entity47 : ' i am sure that the site would make lots of money because it is a prime bit of real estate			0
but i 'd want to know if the @entity7 has done its sums properly			1
‘ the @entity7 is in a position where it is saying , " we are running out of money , so let 's sell something off to raise money "			1
repatriation : princess @entity36 's body was flown back to @entity4 after she died in @entity63 ready for action : newly delivered @entity66 fighters are lined up at @entity4 in 1938 @entity4 opened in 1915 - three years before the formation of the @entity44 ' we might be in a position where it does n't make sense over the long term			1
it would have quite a big impact because @entity4 is where all the very senior people and the royals fly from			1
' @entity4 is one of the most famous @entity80 airfields , housing spitfire and @entity66 squadrons which protected the capital during the @entity84			2
in 1943 it became the first airfield flying @entity86 into @entity88 airspace to support bomber operations			0
an industry source told the @entity47 that the @entity39 satellite idea ' has its advocates because of its location close to the capital and to @entity39 , and there are some people who would welcome it '			1
they added : ‘ but it shares some of the drawbacks of extending @entity39 , including the increase in noise for communities in west @entity15			2
’ a @entity105 spokesman said : ‘ as the chancellor made clear in his autumn statement , we will explore all the options for maintaining the @entity111 's aviation hub status with the exception of a third runway at @entity39			1
' the government will consult on an overarching sustainable framework for @entity111 aviation this spring			0
’ it is not the first time such a proposal has been made			0
in the 1990s the @entity120 considered converting @entity4 into an offshoot of @entity39			1
while the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using @entity39 , new parallel runways were suggested			2
these suggestions were opposed by then mp for @entity130 , @entity131 , and eventually the scheme progressed no further			0
@entity4 is currently where @entity133 lands during visits by the @entity136 president , but @entity39 is just four miles away and could be used for visiting dignitaries			1
@entity138 steps onto the tarmac at @entity4 after being released from @entity140 property developers would be keen to get their hands on the prime real estate west of @entity15 there are some in the military who will argue to retain an @entity7 ‘ core ’ at @entity4 , even if it becomes a commercial hub in the future			1
a @entity7 spokesman told @entity151 : ' we continue to scrutinise all defence expenditure to secure the best value for money			2
' @entity4 is no exception			2
it already generates revenue through landing fees from private flights and sources of income generation are of course kept under review			0
' an @entity7 source suggested a sale was ' unlikely '			2
in recent years the base , which is the @entity44 ’s oldest operational airfield , has been placed in the spotlight due to the @entity111 's apparent support of @entity171 rendition flights			1
three years ago the former @entity140 prisoner @entity138 was flown back to @entity4 after his release			2
in 2001 seriously ill @entity175 @entity174 was flown from @entity176 to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers			0
it has also been used as a location for films made at @entity182			0
the @entity183 lands at @entity4 following the death of his grandmother , the @entity185 in march 2002 in 1912 a proposal was made for the area around what is now @entity4 to be developed as ‘ @entity189 ’			2
the outbreak of the @entity191 necessitated a new airbase for the @entity193			0
major @entity194 of the @entity196 settled on a site near @entity199 railway station but it was not until january 1915 that the @entity111 government officially requisitioned the land			0
construction of the aerodrome , to be named @entity205 , @entity206 , began in january 1915			0
it opened on 3 may 1915 , and became known as ‘ @entity4 ’ despite actually being situated in @entity208 , because the nearest station was @entity199			2
in the same year the airfield was extended westwards and aircraft began flying sorties in defence of @entity15 against @entity215 raids			0
in 1918 the @entity44 was founded , replacing the @entity193			0
the @entity216 was built around 1920 , and is still operational today as is one hangar and several barrack blocks dating from the mid- 1920s to the 1930s			0
in the 1930s , @entity4 was the first station to operate the @entity66 and during the @entity80 was again one of the key airfields in the defence of @entity15			2
during the @entity84 , @entity4 was ' home ' to a series of allied and @entity111 @entity66 and @entity86 squadrons , including a complete @entity227 wing			2
in 1943 , @entity4 's @entity228 became the first @entity226 as a unit to operate over @entity88			1
one notable flight took place in 1944 when liberator ' @entity232 ' flew non-stop from @entity233 to @entity4 , taking a mere 19 hours and 46 minutes			2
in 1946 the airfield was loaned for civil use while @entity39 was under construction and by 1952 , @entity4 was the busiest airfield in @entity238			1
in december 1946 , after taking off during a heavy snowstorm , a @entity239 operated by @entity240 , flying from @entity4 to @entity241 , crashed onto the roof of a house in @entity208			0
a @entity245 crashed on the roof of a house in @entity208 shortly after taking off from @entity4 in december 1946			0
everyone escaped and left the house by the front door all the crew and passengers escaped unharmed by climbing through the loft of the house and leaving via the front door			0
civil flights ceased when the central area at @entity39 opened in 1954 with @entity4 reverting to sole military use in may that year			1
by the 1980s movements of privately - owned aircraft , mainly corporate jets , outnumbered military aircraft			0
civil flights were limited to 28 per day , with a maximum of 7,000 a year			0
this limit remains to this day			0
much media attention focused on the airfield when the body of @entity36 , arrived there from @entity268 , in @entity63 after her death on 31 august 1997			1
the @entity270 , then based at neighbouring @entity271 , acted as the bearer party			0
four years later attention again focused on @entity4 when the seriously ill fugitive @entity175 @entity174 was flown from @entity176 to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers			1
@entity174 was taken straight to @entity277 to complete the remainder of his sentence			0
over the past 60 years it has been used to welcome foreign dignitaries to the country .			0

@entity4 could be worth ' hundreds of millions ' to developers
airfield where princess @entity36 's body was repatriated from @entity63
@entity7 also considering plans to use base as a @entity39 satellite
