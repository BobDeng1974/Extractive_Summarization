by @entity0 it is an incredible view of how the world looked during the ice age			1
an online mapmaker has revealed a unique map showing the world as it would have looked 14,000 years ago , when the last ice age was at its harshest			1
designers worked with geologists to accurately map the massive landbridges and ice sheets that made the world a very different place			2
the unique map shows the world as it would have looked 14,000 years ago , when the ice age was at its harshest			1

the world as it looks today : this modern map shows the incredible differences since the ice age the map was created by @entity21 , an amateur graphic designer from @entity22			1
' it is the first map of its kind on such a scale and level of complexity , and depicts our planet as it looked during the late glacial maximum of the last ice age , 14,000 years @entity33 , ' he told @entity34			1
' if i include time devoted to proper research , the map took about a month and a half to be fully finished , '			0
' i contacted several university geologists and climatologists who provided me the needed scientific data about the various prehistoric lakes , extent of sea levels , actual size of ice sheets , late pleistocene hydrology , climate and even sea currents in year 14.000 @entity51 ( at the end of the @entity53 , about 2 - 3 thousand years before the late glacial maximum and massive meltdown )			1
the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) refers to that period in earth 's history when the glaciers were at their thickest and the sea levels at their lowest			1
@entity21 , an amateur graphic designer from @entity22 spent six weeks making the map			0
he worked with university geologists and climatologists , and included data about prehistoric lakes , extent of sea levels , actual size of ice sheets , late pleistocene hydrology , climate and even sea currents in year 14.000 @entity51 the maps also show how the climate has changed , using the most accurate records available			1
the image , which can also be bought as a poster , includes one full large detailed map of the world , 2 major maps showcasing northern and southern polar regions and 2 detailed minimaps comparing present day climate to that during the late glacial maximum			0
' i included present day - countries and cities on the map , to help people understand the geography of the @entity89 world and compare it to present more accurately			0
' because of the massive decline of sea levels ( caused by the accumulation of water in massive ice sheets ) , boundaries were extended according to exclusive economic zones and official maritime boundaries			1
' i was genuinely surprised about how the climate and geography of the world has changed in only about 16 thousand years ( only a fraction of time when compared to @entity103 's history )			2
' i plan to make some similarly - themed maps in future , showing the world 65 million and 150 million years ago			0
at the time of the @entity108 , the continents had moved to their current positions			0
at one point during the @entity89 , sheets of ice covered all of @entity114 , large parts of @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118 , and small areas in @entity120			2
in @entity117 they stretched over @entity121 and @entity122 and parts of the northern @entity124			0
the remains of glaciers of the @entity89 can still be seen in parts of the world , including @entity121 and @entity114			0
there was a lot of movement over time , and there were about 20 cycles when the glaciers would advance and retreat as they thawed and refroze			0
the major effects of the ice age are erosion and deposition of material over large parts of the continents , modification of river systems , creation of millions of lakes , changes in sea level , development of pluvial lakes far from the ice margins , isostatic adjustment of the crust , and abnormal winds			1
it affects oceans , flooding , and biological communities scientists identified the @entity108 ’s four key stages , or ages — @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
the name @entity108 is the combination of two @entity169 words : pleistos ( meaning “ most ” ) and kainos ( meaning “ new ” or “ recent ” )			0
it was first used in 1839 by sir @entity172 , a @entity173 geologist and lawyer			0
the world 16,000 years ago was in many ways radically different to the present ; because large amounts of water were concentrated in the massive ice sheets covering the majority of @entity117 and western @entity183 , sea levels were about 110 meters lower when compared to today			1
this exposed massive land bridges , most notably @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
northern hemisphere was covered by two main ice sheets ; the @entity191 , covering the much of northern @entity116 and western @entity193 , reaching as far south as @entity194 , and the @entity196 complex , which covered almost entire @entity122 and portions of northern @entity124			2
major ice sheets were also present in mountainous areas , most notably in the @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			2
the @entity204 hemisphere was covered by two main ice sheets ; the @entity191 , covering the much of northern @entity116 and western @entity193 , reaching as far south as @entity194 , and the @entity196 complex , which covered almost entire @entity122 and portions of northern @entity124 .			0

@entity206 shows globe as it would have looked during the the last ice age
sea levels were about 110 meters lower when compared to today
massive land bridges were exposed , most notably @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188
