a huge step towards recreating the woolly mammoth has been taken by scientists who inserted more than a dozen of its genes into the live dna of an elephant			1
researchers studied the structure of @entity6 from mammoths preserved in the @entity11 to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal ’s genes			1
these were then integrated by experts at @entity16 in @entity17 into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal dna			1
he said : ‘ we prioritised genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness , ear size , subcutaneous fat and , especially , haemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen around the body )			2
’ ‘ de-extinction ’ enthusiast mr @entity29 , who was speaking to the @entity44 science editor @entity43 , added : ‘ we now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth @entity6 in them			2
’ mammoths co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food			0
comparison : the mammoth was roughly the size as a modern @entity55 elephant , standing up to 11ft tall they are the best studied of all prehistoric animals thanks to the discovery of frozen carcasses , as well as dung and skeletons			0
the mammoth was roughly the size as a modern @entity55 elephant , standing up to 11ft tall and weighing about seven tonnes , and its fur and long hair protected it from severe winters			0
there are at least three teams trying to rebuild the whole mammoth genome - which could one day become a template to recreate actual mammoths , reported @entity44			1
but ancient @entity6 expert professor @entity71 said : ‘ money would be better spent focusing on conserving what we do have - than spending it on an animal that has been extinct for thousands of years			0
’ last week , @entity77 reported how scientists had begun extracting dna from the remains of a mammoth found in @entity82 , taking bone marrow samples from its front left leg			2
the samples will be examined at a laboratory in @entity87 , @entity88 , and by scientists in @entity90 - with the hope of one day being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals .			0

scientists study structure of dna from mammoths preserved in @entity11
