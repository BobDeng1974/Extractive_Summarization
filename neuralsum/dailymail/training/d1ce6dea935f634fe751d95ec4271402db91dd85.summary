by @entity0 a space professor from @entity2 is battling ' to save @entity3 ' from a solar storm that experts fear will wreak worldwide chaos next year			1
professor @entity7 , who chairs the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) and advises the government on space weather , says solar storms , generated by an outburst from the sun , are set to knock out national power grids and @entity16			1
he believes magnetic rays from the storm will result in widespread blackouts which will plunge homes and businesses into darkness			1
early next year , the sun will reach the peak of its 11 - year activity cycle , which puts the planet at greater risk of such storms			1
and experts say with the planet now relying on the @entity48 and hi - tech gadgetry , the chaos caused by the 2013 solar storm will have a far greater impact than any in the past			1
prof @entity7 , who studied at @entity51 , warned : ' a big magnetic storm can permeate the @entity3 's crust , which can drive electric currents through aluminium or copper wires in the @entity28 , which could cause a national blackout			1
' interactions with @entity3 's atmosphere can also affect any radio signals			1
if you had a big storm , @entity16 might be unavailable for a couple of days			1
' on july 21 this year there was a very large event on the far side of the sun , if it had intercepted @entity3 we would have had a very large magnetic storm			1
' all manner of transport relies on gps including aircraft and if the systems suddenly collapse , there could be lethal consequences			1
he said ' my main interest is to study the likely extremes in these scenarios			0
these are enormous events that could have a very significant effect on gdp			0
' the @entity28 now relies on warnings from space craft carrying equipment built at @entity88 and they are developing plans on how to evolve			2
' detecting : @entity90 - the @entity90 - observes particles of solar , interplanetary , interstellar , and galactic origins magnetic storms on @entity3 are caused by @entity94 ( @entity95 ) on the sun , where large clouds of gas held in place by the sun 's magnetic field are suddenly released			1
when magnetic storms permeate the @entity3 's crust , the direct current can meet with the alternating current in the @entity28 and over power transformers , causing them to malfunction			1
prof @entity7 explained there is currently one possible defence			0
' it sounds counter-intuitive , but actually the @entity28 could switch on the whole grid , to block the effect of extra currents			2
unlike many recent natural disasters , a huge solar flare would cause the greatest suffering in developed countries			0
plasma balls blasting out from the surface of the sun could wipe out our modern electricity grids , which would draw the energy to them like antennas and quickly overload			2
this would have a knock on effect on many of the systems that support our lives , including water and sewage treatment , medicine cooling , supermarket delivery , power station controls and financial markets			2
to rebuild the grid , the melted transformer hubs would need to be replaced but new ones take up to a year to make to order			0
at present @entity143 's @entity90 ( @entity90 ) is the most important indicator of incoming space weather			0
it can give 15 to 45 minutes warning of geomagnetic storms and power companies need 15 minutes to prepare systems for a critical event			2
however , @entity90 is 14 years old and already operating beyond its planned lifespan with no planned replacement			0
prof @entity7 said ' we will largely lose the early warning capability			0
' ' at the moment we rely on one @entity157 aircraft called @entity90 which measures the speed of solar flares , plasma coming towards @entity3 , and its speed and density , but even that can only give a 20 minute warning			1
' prof @entity7 warned that even though next year would bring a peak of solar activity , the @entity3 is always under threat			1
' next year is a peak in activity			2
however , we ca n't find a link between these peaks and the major events like @entity174			0
you should n't breath a sigh of relief and think you are safe , this is a constant risk			0
' experts are warning that the government must make contingency plans for the solar storm which could create severe water and food shortages			1
in 1859 the so - called ' @entity186 ' was a magnetic storm that struck @entity3 - long before the @entity48 and gps - and caused the failure of telegraph systems all over @entity190 and @entity191			1
the @entity192 were reportedly seen as far south as @entity193			0
in 2009 a report funded by @entity143 claimed similar storms today would lead to ' planetary disaster			0
' the study outlined the devastating impact it would have			0
for instance it could leave half of the @entity157 without power within 90 seconds , without coal after 30 days and would take the country a decade to recover			0
such a scenario would also cost an estimated Â£ 1.5trillion - and that would just be in the first year			2
prof @entity7 told the @entity208 magazine in 2009 that ' i do n't think the report is scaremongering			0
this is a fair and balanced report			0
' the flare emitted during the @entity186 event in 1859 travelled so fast it took less than 15 minutes to reach @entity3 anyway			1
the report 's chief author @entity215 from the @entity217 said he hoped it would push decision - makers into action			2
' it takes a lot of effort to educate policy - makers , and that is especially true with these low - frequency events			0
but we are moving closer and closer to the edge of a possible disaster ' , he said			0

@entity28 and gps expected to go down if burst from sun hits our planet
@entity240 will reach peak of 11 - year solar storm cycle next year , and magnetic storms could knock out most of @entity3 's electrical items
a big storm in 1859 knocked out early telegraph systems - but world is much more *dependent* on electricity now
