traditional missions to @entity1 involve large rockets for both blasting off and slowing down			0
however , researchers believe there may be a simpler , cheaper way			0
rather than blasting to the red planet and using rockets to slow themselves down , future craft could simply use planetary gravity fields to ' drift ' into the @entity1 atmosphere			1
called ballistic capture , the new method could help open the @entity1 frontier for more robotic missions , future manned expeditions and even colonization efforts , researchers say - and even @entity18 is interested			1
traditional missions use rockets to shoot for the location @entity1 will be in its orbit where the spacecraft will meet it - known as a @entity24 transfer			1
the new method puts the spacecraft into a @entity1 - like orbit so that it flies ahead of the planet , slowing down until it is pulled to the surface by the gravitational force			1
while launch and cruise costs remain the same , the large , complex burn to slow down and hit the planet at the perfect speed is not needed			0
once at the red planet , @entity1 ' own gravitational field could catch hold and pull them down			0
called ballistic capture , it could help open the @entity1 frontier for more robotic missions , future manned expeditions and even colonization efforts , researchers say - and even @entity18 is interested			1
' it 's an eye - opener , ' @entity47 , director of @entity18 's @entity48 , told @entity50			2
' it could be a pretty big step for us and really save us resources and capability , which is always what we 're looking for			0

' that 's the magic of ballistic capture â€” it 's like flying in formation , ' says @entity87 , a longtime @entity18 employee and expert , and co-author , with @entity90 of the @entity91 of the new paper , posted on @entity93 , and submitted to the journal @entity95			0
' we construct a new type of transfer from the @entity100 to @entity1 , which ends in ballistic capture , ' the pair wrote			0
in 1990 @entity87 applied his ideas for low energy transfer orbits to the @entity105 lunar probe @entity106 , which had been designed only for lunar swing - by and had suffered a failure of the @entity106 lunar orbiter			1
the main @entity106 probe lacked the fuel to enter lunar orbit using a conventional @entity24 transfer trajectory , but @entity87 was able to devise a ballistic capture trajectory that would put it in lunar orbit using only a negligible amount of fuel			1
the probe entered lunar orbit in 1991 , the first time that @entity87 's ideas had been put to the test			1
' this results in a substantial savings in capture from that of a classical @entity24 transfer under certain conditions			0
' this transfer type may be of interest for @entity1 missions because of lower capture costs , moderate flight time , and flexibility of launch period from the @entity100			0
' ' this new class of transfers to @entity1 offers new mission possibilities for @entity1 missions			2
' the method could one day be used for manned missions to @entity1 - although it would add several months to mission times			1
@entity87 worked out how to let the competing gravities of @entity100 , the sun and moon gently pull a spacecraft into a desired lunar orbit			2
all three bodies can be thought of as creating bowl - like depressions in spacetime			0
by lining up the trajectory of a spacecraft through those bowls , such that momentum slackens along the route , a spacecraft can just ' roll ' down at the end into the moon 's small bowl , easing into orbit fuel - free			1
' it 's a delicate dance , ' @entity87 said .			0

*current* missions use rocket to slow themselves as they *approach* planets
new , slower mission would be *gradually* ' grabbed ' by *martian* gravity
would add several months to mission - but make it cheaper
theory used in 1990 to put *stricken* @entity105 probe into moon 's orbit
