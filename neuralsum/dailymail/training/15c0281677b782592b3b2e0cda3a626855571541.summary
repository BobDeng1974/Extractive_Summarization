@entity10 striker @entity9 may not have settled into life in the @entity23 but @entity13 are willing to give him a chance to revive his career in the @entity26			0
the 22 - year - old has shown flashes of what he is capable of in the @entity30 including the winner against @entity17 on @entity32 2012 but it has been all too fleeting and not helped by an atmosphere of turmoil and change around teh @entity36			1
@entity38 drift : @entity10 striker @entity9 could make a shock move to the @entity26 with @entity13 a loan spell with @entity42 strugglers @entity43 earlier this year raised his profile again and @entity13 have seen enough in the @entity45 to make @entity10 an offer			2
a deal is expected to be agreed over the coming weeks with @entity9 having the benefit of not being cup - tied for the @entity49			0
@entity13 coach sees him as a player who can help soften the blow of @entity55 's pending departure			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , are contemplating a move for @entity57 left - back @entity58			0
manager @entity60 brought the best out of @entity62 while at @entity63 and is keen to solve a problem left - back position			0
the 33 - year - old had a spell at @entity10 on loan from @entity17 in 2012 and may see it as a last shot at the @entity30 even though @entity57 are in the play - off positions			1
@entity60 has also considered options in @entity72 including @entity74 's @entity73 , 29			0
@entity75 needed ? @entity15 reacts after a missed chance during the dour 0 - 0 draw with @entity10 @entity14 want @entity16 striker @entity15 but need a quick answer from him before they move to other targets			1
the @entity80 are keen to bring high profile players to their league and will offer in the region of £ 2million a season			0
@entity15 , 30 , flirted with the prospect of moving to @entity86 in the summer before he fought to get a contract back at @entity16			1
however , he has struggled to cement a regular place			0
@entity89 is due to return and @entity16 are continuing to look for new strikers			2
@entity91 do n't want transfer sagas of the past and are willing to move for @entity95 's @entity94 should @entity15 not fancy the move			2
alternative : @entity16 are willing to move for @entity95 's @entity94 should @entity15 not fancy the move @entity17 have beaten @entity18 to the signing of @entity21 junior goalkeeper @entity20			1
the 15 - year - old had trials at @entity17 and @entity18 earlier this season			1
the @entity104 keeper has been likened to @entity18 legend and his idol @entity106			0
his father , @entity107 , told @entity108 : ' i can confirm that @entity20 will move to @entity17 this summer			2
' blue : young @entity21 goalkeeper @entity20 has chosen @entity17 over @entity18 after his trials big move : the 15 - year - old was playing his football for @entity104 in his native country @entity16 manager @entity116 was in @entity117 on sunday night to watch @entity118 against @entity119			1
@entity116 is in the market for two strikers and a centre - back but @entity16 are trying to do all three as loans as they consider the future			1
@entity125 has already expressed concerns over the return on their £ 17million outlay for @entity89 and has to be realistic about their @entity30 prospects			0
search is on : @entity132 is still on @entity16 's radar , but @entity116 was in @entity117 looking at several others rather than risk further financial damages should they go down he wants to safeguard the situation by allowing short term deals with the potential to change in the summer			1
@entity116 left the stands at @entity141 after 45 minutes with the latest player brought to his attention being @entity119 's @entity144			2
full name @entity144 , the @entity146 is an important figure in @entity119 's squad but they are willing to sell players as they continue to redress their own financial troubles - compounded by failure to qualify for the @entity49			2
@entity119 want £ 5.3million for the 29 - year - old so unless they relent on that stance a deal seems unlikely with @entity16 's current policy			1
value : @entity119 want £ 5.3million for the 29 - year - old as they continue to redress financial problems the same applies for @entity160 's @entity159 and @entity161 of @entity162 with both commanding fees			1
@entity164 's @entity132 remains at the forefront of their thinking , while @entity168 ' @entity167 and @entity170 's giant @entity169 are other names that have been discussed			0
@entity116 has also asked for checks on defenders with @entity175 's @entity174 , currently on loan with @entity177 and @entity179 's @entity178 among the candidates			1
@entity178 , 24 , has also been watched by @entity10 and @entity181			0
@entity181 's hopes of signing @entity184 striker @entity183 have improved after he was asked to take a pay cut by the @entity187 club			1
the 29 - year - old is out of contract in the summer and free to talk to foreign clubs from january			1
it is understood that @entity184 have made him an offer but it would mean his basic pay being cut from £ 16,000 per week to £ 14,000			2
@entity181 can certainly better that and @entity195 will be weighing up an offer over the coming days as he mulls over different targets for his attack			0
here and there : @entity183 could be on his way back to the @entity30 with @entity181 @entity202 winger @entity201 is catching the eye of a few @entity30 clubs			1
the @entity206 flyer was voted player of the tournament at the @entity209 and has already attracted @entity160 , @entity210 and @entity211 this season			0
which @entity30 secretary was sitting very uncomfortably when he found out the club 's new x-ray and medical scanning room would be situated directly under his office ? voicing his fear that radiation would seep through , the company fitting the equipment duly obliged by applying lead lining to the ceiling of the newly - fitted room at the club 's training ground			2
newcastle are due to watch @entity202 on wednesday against @entity228 and the 27 - year - old will be keen to impress			1
however , another player @entity227 will watch closely is developing defensive midfielder @entity231 who has drawn scouts from @entity164 , @entity233 and @entity18			0
the 19 - year - old @entity235 - born player is in his debut season for the first team but looks a star in the making			1
@entity233 and @entity18 watched him on saturday but also took the opportunity to run the rule over @entity242 ahead of the @entity49 draw and to weigh up any players who may become available from their squad			2
@entity245 : @entity242 are trying to sign @entity247 ' @entity246 , which could lead to a merry go round @entity242 are trying to sign former @entity18 midfielder @entity246 from @entity247 and that could lead to others leaving @entity235			1
@entity250 , @entity251 and the small , but very effective , @entity252 are all considering their futures and would fit the @entity30 well			1
@entity227 , who remain keen on @entity164 target , @entity258 's @entity257 , will tie up wednesday 's scouting mission on @entity202 by watching @entity260 also over the coming days			0
@entity261 have given an contract extension to teenager @entity263 amid ongoing speculation he could yet leave @entity265			2
@entity18 sent three scouts to watch the 17 - year - old last week to compile reports while @entity268 , @entity247 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity10 and @entity271 have also been among the visiting scouts monitoring his progress and that of teammates @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 who signed a new three year deal last week			1
@entity280 : @entity261 have given @entity263 a contract extension to warn off those interested in the young star @entity284 is considering retirement from a persistent knee injury which is accentuating @entity288 's need for a centre - back			1
@entity290 of @entity233 remains a name in the frame but @entity288 have also sent scouts to @entity294 to weigh up cheaper targets			0
@entity296 are showing interest in @entity227 's @entity298			0
the 23 - year - old has been on loan at @entity301 and was expecting to continue there for the rest of the season			1
@entity304 have taken @entity306 's @entity305 on trial			0
limited opportunities : @entity298 ( right ) is being looked at by @entity309 side @entity296 @entity211 are considering reviving interest in @entity296 forward @entity311			2
the 20 - year - old @entity315 international shot to prominence while at @entity313 where @entity233 and @entity269 sent scouts to check his progress			1
however , he moved to @entity296 under controversial circumstances , with @entity313 claiming he had broken his contract , but has failed to make any real impression and is looking for a fresh start			0
@entity325 has a limited budget but is looking for a striker and a centre - back			2
@entity311 was a target for @entity330 last summer and could go out on loan but @entity325 may want a greater physical presence			0
return ? @entity211 continue to attempt to bring former forward @entity333 back to the club for the @entity335 off - season @entity211 are continuing to work on a loan for former striker @entity333 at @entity337 but @entity162 , @entity164 and @entity16 have also asked			1
we mentioned @entity340 's interest in @entity341 last week and meetings are ongoing over that deal but there still remains a difference on valuation with the @entity347 coming up short so far			0
a request to take @entity341 on loan for £ 1million is not what @entity211 were looking for			2
@entity351 were the only club that had made an enquiry to take @entity353 on loan from @entity270 this season			1
@entity3 understands though that in the week before @entity358 's injury , @entity356 asked if they could take him			0
manager @entity359 said he could n't afford to let him go and @entity353 , 20 , took his first team chance at @entity270 instead			0
no interest : @entity351 were the only side to make a loan offer for @entity353 the departures of @entity365 and @entity366 could have bearings on @entity18 transfer exits this january			1
@entity365 was keen on @entity18 winger @entity369 and @entity210 was understood to be @entity18 's preference as long as they got someone else in to replace the @entity373 international			2
@entity227 , @entity271 , @entity162 and @entity164 have also expressed interest			0
@entity377 's change in manager may affect the future of @entity18 's @entity380 and @entity381 who were both on the list of @entity366			0
@entity381 , who was injured in training on saturday , has failed to kick on this season when @entity18 needed him to and , if they can find another striker , they may well listen to offers .			0

@entity14 want @entity16 striker @entity15 but need a quick answer
@entity16 boss @entity116 visits @entity117 in search of strikers and defender
@entity181 's hopes of signing @entity183 improve after he was asked to take a pay cut by @entity184
@entity261 extend @entity18 target @entity263 's contract
@entity242 eye up @entity246 , which could open up @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity403 to the @entity30
@entity351 the only club to enquire to take @entity353 on loan this term
@entity211 continue attempts to bring back forward @entity333
