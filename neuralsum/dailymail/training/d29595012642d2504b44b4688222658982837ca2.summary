by @entity0 my friends have always called me a magpie			1
i 'm drawn to all that glitters and working as a tv , film , and stage actress since the age of five , i 've been lucky enough to come across my fair share of bling , some real , some very fake			1
over the years though i 've gradually learnt that less is often more and tried to temper my tastes , and budget , to match			1
so it was with great excitement that i heard about @entity16 's new jewellery range			1
as a lover of costume jewellery , i know that dramatic and wildly glamorous necklaces can cost from almost nothing to thousands of pounds , but £ 1 ? surely that does n't even stretch to a decent clasp to see how convincing cheap jewellery is - and whether it 's ever worth forking out a fortune for - i put eight necklaces priced between £ 1 to £ 1,000 to the test			1
feels expensive fooled : @entity0 thought this necklace was expensive this must cost hundreds			1
the stones are beautifully iridescent with shimmering blues , purples and greens and , in places , layered upon one another			1
it looks as if it 's been carefully put together			1
the distressed gold chain is glitzy but not too shiny and it feels weighty and substantial			2
a carefully considered neckline is essential as it 's so wide it almost touches my shoulders			2
this would work will with a strapless gown or boat - neck top			2
@entity47 : £ 500 real price : £ 29.99 @entity49 simply charming sweet but cheap : but costs more than a £ 1 sweet but uninspiring , the chain looks breakable and i worry this would n't last more than a couple of outings			1
the woven gold design is nothing terribly special and little thought has gone into its length which comes up an inch too short			2
it ’s probably the cheapest of the lot and could cost £ 1 but it 's perfectly acceptable to fill in a neckline and worn with the right thing could pass for gold if you did n’t look too closely			2
@entity47 : £ 1 real price : £ 14 @entity70 striking and elegant thumbs up : @entity0 did n't guess this was the cheapest clearly this comes from the lower end of the @entity74			1
it looks simply put together and is so dainty it could blow away in a strong wind			2
having said that , the asymmetric leaf design is striking and elegant and the gold metal reflects the light and sits beautifully			2
i 'd happily buy and wear this during the day layered over a simple white t - shirt or with a plunge - neck evening gown			2
@entity47 : £ 20 real price : £ 1 @entity85 pricey but garish too much : does n't look expensive you have to be in the right mood for this			1
it 's brash , over-the - top and luminous with an @entity92 's cave of colours and sparkling jewels			2
it looks the most expensive as a lot of work seems to have gone into crafting it , with so many intricate settings			0
the clasp is gold - plated and robust			0
there 's no chance of this slipping off into the soup during supper but it 's far too overwhelming for me to wear			0
though probably expensive , oddly enough it makes me feel cheap			0
@entity47 : £ 1,000 real price : £ 580 @entity111 jewel and neon stone necklace , benna.co.uk gaudy glitter plastic looking : but it costs £ 70 on stage this would be great as you 'd assume it was real diamonds but up close it looks like cheap glitter , probably from @entity123 or somewhere similar			1
the design is pretty enough , but i shy away from silver and plain crystal as it washes out my fair complexion			0
i 'd rather save up for a real diamond than buy this plastic looking piece of frippery			0
@entity47 : £ 30 real price : £ 70 @entity135 necklace , stelladot.co.uk lovely but flimsy favourite : @entity0 loved the colours from afar this looks like tacky fairground jewellery but once on , it 's one of my favourites			1
sitting comfortably around my neck , it does n't twist or pucker			0
the deep greens , blues and turquoises are almost ethereal but the clasp is depressingly bulky yet flimsy			0
it looks like it might break easily			0
i would wear this , but reckon it 's on the cheaper side ... @entity47 : £ 50 real price : £ 279 @entity154 , @entity155 , 020 7629 9161 style over substance @entity158 : but this one costs £ 1,000 this looks like a pretender			1
it 's matte gold with sparkly jewels trying to look like diamonds and rubies			0
some of the spiky edges dig into my neck and no matter how i adjust it it wo n't lie flat			0
i wrestled with the clasp , too			0
the design is faintly art deco and i can imagine @entity174 gadding about in something similar , but there is no finesse to the finish			0
i would n't spend too much on it			0
@entity47 : £ 100 real price : £ 1,000 @entity182 18ct gold plated necklace , wolfandbadger.co.uk @entity185 chic wearable : looks expensive what a classy necklace			1
rows of carefully set stones , shiny gold and threaded ribbon gives this a slightly @entity185 feel			0
i ’m often intimidated by oversized , overly gaudy items - i find they look too young on an older person - but this is wearable and dramatic without being try - hard			0
i ’d happily wear it with simple evening dresses			0
@entity47 : £ 250 real price : £ 55 @entity202 black and gold necklace , grayandosbourn.co.uk interview by : @entity207 @entity206 : @entity208 : l + @entity209 & make - up : @entity211 using @entity212 and @entity213 : @entity214			1

@entity0 was *skeptical* about bargain necklaces
she tried on eight and we asked her to guess their price
