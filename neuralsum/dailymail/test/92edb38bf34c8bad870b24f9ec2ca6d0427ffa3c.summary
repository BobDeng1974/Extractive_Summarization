a woman who successfully set up her brother with one of her best friends ended up becoming so jealous of their relationship she tried to wreck their marriage			0
husband and wife @entity8 and @entity9 , 53 and 52 , from @entity10 , have told their shocking story of harassment , which culminated in @entity8 's sister @entity16 cancelling the couple 's wedding using a fake email address just weeks before the big day			1
the couple have spoken about their family feud on @entity24 documentary , @entity23 , which airs tonight			0
i did not think someone was capable of doing that , ' says @entity9 of the horrifying moment @entity16 informed them she 'd managed to cancel their nuptials behind their back			1
' everything was paid for so it was a lot of worry , ' she added			0
luckily , the couple managed to piece their plans back together in time for their winter wedding though			2
and they subsequently took @entity16 to court for harassment			1
@entity9 first met @entity8 after his 20 - year marriage fell apart and her friend @entity16 , @entity8 's sister , suggested they meet			1
' i met @entity16 for coffee and @entity8 came out and i 've never let his side since , ' she says			1
' when i first met him i did n’t realise how important he would become			0
' before long the couple were inseparable			0
but although @entity16 's matchmaking had worked , she was not happy about their relationship and started sending @entity9 threatening text messages telling her to stop seeing her brother			1
' they were hurtful at the time but i could n’t understand why			0
maybe it was jealousy , ' says @entity9			2
‘ my mum had lung cancer and was going through chemo at the time			0
@entity16 was sending messages saying , " your mum ’s dying and you better get back to her "			1
' @entity70 , pretended to be her now sister - in - law and cancelled her brother 's wedding but the relationship continued and @entity9 and @entity8 became even closer			1
then one day @entity9 proposed			2
' i was joking around - but not , ' says @entity9			2
then @entity8 took the hint and gave @entity9 a romantic proposal			1
for a while the angry texts from @entity16 tailed off			2
' we went to the registry office , put the deposit down and made special invites - i could n't believe it was really happening , ' @entity9 says of the wedding			1
' my mum got involved in the beginning and helped me pick my dress			0
' but in 2012 , @entity9 ’s mother lost her battle with cancer and a year later @entity8 ’s mother @entity89 also became ill and moved in with @entity9 and @entity8			1
but @entity9 would n’t let @entity16 in their house , which reignited the rift			1
‘ i would n’t let her come to my house and see her mum because of all the hurtful thing she ’s said to me			0
' she could come to take her out but not in the house			0
' she made a big deal about that and said that i was trying to replace my mum with her mum and that i was taking her away from her			0
' then 20 days before the wedding , the couple received a distressing phone call			2
@entity8 remembers : ' i was lying in bed when the phone rang and @entity16 said : " i 've got to tell you - you might want to pot the phone on loudspeaker			1
" ' then she said : " i ’ve saved you from divorce			0
i 've cancelled your wedding			2
" ' @entity8 and @entity9 at their wedding @entity9 says : ' i was in tears and angry			1
i wanted to go nuts at her			0
everything was paid for so it was a lot of worry			0
we were up all night			0
' i did not think someone was capable of doing that			0
' how low can you get ? this is your brother getting married			0
we had paid for everything and i thought she ’d ruined it			0
' in the morning we rang the registry office and they confirmed that our wedding had been cancelled			2
' they said we should come in so they could print everything off for us to give to the police			0
' @entity16 had created an email address in @entity9 's name to set about jeopardising the couple 's plans			1
luckily the registry office juggled things around and were able to fit @entity8 and @entity9 back in on their planned date			1
@entity70 called @entity138 20 days before her brother 's wedding and canceled it @entity16 was jailed for eight weeks at @entity142			1
when @entity9 reported @entity16 to the police , @entity16 admitted it straight away and was given a date to appear in court			1
but the angry text messages still continued and when the big day arrived , the couple still feared @entity16 might ruin it			1
@entity9 and @entity8 at their wedding ' we did n’t see her until we got out side , ' remembers @entity9 of their wedding day			1
' we were going to get photos taken when she started shouting commiserations , filming me and putting two fingers up			2
' i wish i did n’t have to go through that , but i still had the best day i could have wished for			0
' at court , @entity16 pleaded guilty to harassment and was sent to prison			2
she was jailed for eight weeks at @entity142 and was also given a restraining order against @entity9 for an indefinite period			2
@entity8 said : ' it was quite upsetting			2
she got eight weeks but i believe she only did four			0
' and of @entity16 's injunction against coming near @entity9 , @entity8 says : ' it 's the best way – the less we see of her the better			1
' @entity9 says : ' it 's jealousy bitterness and anger			1
to this day if she could split us up she would			0
' but we ’ve been through so much , i do n’t think there ’s anything out there that could hurt us			0
' @entity16 did not want to appear on the programme but said she had her reasons for cancelling the wedding and loved her brother			1
@entity182 is on @entity24 tonight at 10pm			0
