by @entity1 reporter @entity4 staff are illegally accepting cash from health tourists to give them access to free hospital treatment , an investigation has found			1
it has uncovered a thriving black market in which foreign patients are buying their way on to @entity14 surgery lists for up to £ 1,000 a time			1
once registered with a practice , patients are being seen by gps and then referred for hospital treatment worth tens of thousands of pounds			1
' black market ' : undercover reporters found foreign patients could buy their way onto gp surgery lists ( file photo ) the investigation by the @entity27 ’s @entity26 programme found one manager at a surgery in the @entity30 was offering to register an entire family from @entity32 for £ 5,000			1
he also took £ 800 from a female undercover reporter posing as a health tourist to put her on the practice ’s list			2
the reporter claimed to be an @entity32 patient suffering from the back condition sciatica , which would n’t merit free treatment as it is n’t deemed urgent			2
but she was subsequently referred to hospital for an mri scan that would have cost the @entity4 £ 800 – the same as the cost of her place on the list			1
the unidentified manager told her it was ‘ good business ’ as she had already got her money back with the cost of the scan – and would be likely to benefit from more expensive treatment			1
the manager said : ‘ just with the scan you ’ve made your money			0
’ the investigation also discovered that ‘ fixers ’ – who are n’t employed by the @entity4 – are putting overseas patients on gp lists in exchange for cash			1
these individuals are likely to have close ties with managers or doctors within the surgery who agree to register the patients			2
an undercover reporter posing as a @entity74 illegal immigrant bought a place for £ 200 through a fixer in @entity77 , @entity78 , and was later given free x-rays at hospital			0
and another unidentified fixer selling places on practice lists in @entity78 said : ‘ once you have a gp in this country , there is nothing you want to do that you ca n’t do			1
’ @entity89 mp @entity88 , who is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism , said : ‘ this is nothing short of abuse of precious @entity4 resources			0
it ’s highly irresponsible of somebody to be making money out of patients who are vulnerable			0
‘ the law is clear : if you ’re not eligible for free treatment then you should be paying for it			0
’ earlier this year an investigation by @entity104 magazine estimated that over the last three years health tourists had been given free hospital treatment worth £ 40million			1
by law , only patients who have lived in the @entity108 for the past year are entitled to free hospital treatment on the @entity4			1
health minister : ' we 've got to tighten up the system ' , @entity111 has said treatment at hospital @entity117 units and walk in clinics is also free			2
@entity120 have discretion about whether or not to charge patients who are not on their lists depending on how urgent the patient ’s case is considered			2
hospital staff are meant to check patients have been living in the @entity108 for the past 12 months before treating them , but many do not do so			2
so it is probable that once a patient has been registered with a gp – even at a price – he or she will have access to free hospital care worth thousands of pounds without having to pay			1
the @entity26 investigation found that a third of 133 hospital trusts who replied to @entity142 requests did not check whether patients were entitled to treatment			1
health minister @entity111 admitted she was ‘ surprised it ’s not more than that ’			0
speaking on the programme , she said : ‘ we know there are abuses but we know that some gp practices put quite strict rules and regulations in place before they will accept somebody on their books			0
‘ and we know that we ’ve got to tighten up the system , that ’s why we ’re having a review			0
’ dr @entity159 , head of ethics and science at the @entity162 , said : ‘ nobody likes people gaming the system – coming to the @entity108 and thinking they can just get access to things they would n’t be able to access in other countries			0
’ in june it emerged that one unnamed foreign patient who was being cared for by @entity172 in @entity78 had fled owing around £ 500,000 in medical bills			0
in another case @entity175 - born @entity174 flew to the @entity108 to give birth to quintuplets and received around £ 200,000 in @entity4 care			0
she is married to a wealthy businessman and is thought still to be living in the @entity108 , fighting deportation .			0

@entity26 investigation uncovered a black market serving foreign patients eager to buy their way onto gp surgery lists
once registered with a practice patients can be seen by gps and *potentially* referred for expensive hospital treatment
