having a tea break can significantly boost mood and increase workers ' productivity , scientists found bosses worried that staff are wasting time on tea breaks could not be more wrong , for a new study suggests drinking a cuppa could unlock their hidden potential			1
the research found the process of making and drinking a cup of tea boosts mood and tended to enhance creative problem solving			1
the work was carried out by researchers for the @entity19 food giant , which makes the @entity21 tea brand and is opening a string of tea shops under the @entity25 brand , however it has been independently reviewed and accepted by a scientific journal			1
lead scientist @entity27 said : ‘ these findings appear to confirm what many of us suspect ; that the close to sacred ritual of the tea break can effectively boost your mood , which in turn can lead to other benefits such as improved problem solving			1
‘ we suspect this effect is down to a combination of elements including aspects of tea preparation and the taste and aroma during consumption as well as simply taking a break from other activities			2
’ the presence of caffeine and theanine , which is an amino acid that has been linked to relaxation , may be factors in the positive results			2
the experiments were carried out by the company in @entity57 and involved a group of 150 people , including 116 women , who described themselves as regular tea drinkers			0
one group were asked to make and drink a cup of tea , using hot water , milk and sugar , as they normally would , a second was given some sweets and the third was given a glass of water			2
participants were then tested to assess their mood , creativity and motivation to assess the impact			0
the tests asked people to recount a recent happy event , take part in word games , draw an alien creature , and solve anagram puzzles			0
the study found people who drank the tea had a greater desire for success in the tests than those given water , while they also had a faster response time when faced with difficult problems the team ’s scientific paper said : ‘ there was a significant effect of the condition on valence – pleasure - and arousal			1
water consumption provoked lower pleasantness than tea consumption			0
’ it said the simple process of getting up from a desk to take a break and have a cup of tea may lead to a longer improvement in mood and well - being			0
the paper stated : ‘ with the ever - growing evidence on the role of positive emotions in short and long term well - being and success , it is viable that simple everyday activities generate small improvements in mood which may accumulate to greater benefits over time			0
’ however , significantly , the study found that giving a control group some sweets before they carried out the tests was just as effective in boosting mood , if not even more beneficial			2
the results are due to be published in the journal @entity131 and may well encourage a return of the tea break , which has come under pressure with staff reluctant to be seen as slackers			0
tea contains caffeine and theanine , which are linked to relaxation , and could be making tea drinkers happier a host of other studies have found physical benefits from drinking tea to add to the improvements in mood			1
people who drink tea four times a day for six weeks were found to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol , which may play some part in the results seen by the @entity19 team			1
recent research in @entity157 found people who drink two or three cups of tea a day were 37 per cent less likely to suffer a hip fracture			1
another by a team in @entity164 suggested it is particular good for heart health because of the presence of beneficial flavonoids , which are a type of antioxidant			0
other studies have claimed that drinking three to four cups of tea a day can cut the chance of a heart attack and help prevent certain types of diabetes .			0

researchers found making and drinking tea enhances problem solving
this is because people enjoy making tea and the taste and aroma of drink
scientists say tea contains caffeine and theanine , linked to relaxation
@entity19 test found people were happier after drinking tea rather than water
eating sweets has the same , or an even greater , effect on drinker *'s* mood
