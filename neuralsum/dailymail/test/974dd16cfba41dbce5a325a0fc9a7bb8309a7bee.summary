@entity1 defender @entity0 has enjoyed a promising start to his career in @entity4 , with his versatility proving a key asset in the @entity8 backline and is adamant he will play a central part in their future success			1
during a fine debut season @entity12 , who signed from @entity13 last july for £ 16million , has established himself as a first team regular having already made 36 appearances for @entity1			1

the manager told me , “ you ’re going to be training as a centre - half here because you may have an opportunity to play there at the start of the season ” , ’ @entity12 told the @entity35 ‘ so i trained at centre - half a few times and it went from there			2
i made my debut in the @entity52 at @entity53 and started a lot of games , @entity56 and @entity57 in that position			0
’ @entity12 ( centre ) celebrates as @entity1 continue a recent run of form to go second in the @entity56 @entity1 's defender has gone from strength to strength following £ 16million move from @entity13 in 2014 @entity12 caught the eye during his start to life at the @entity69 and was also deployed at right back and in a central holding midfield role			1
however @entity12 is determined to see his future in central defence for club and country			2
‘ i do n’t want to be known as a utility player who just slots in here , there and everywhere as i want my own secured position			0

‘ long - term , i think i ’ll end up as a central defender			0
it ’s my favourite position			0
