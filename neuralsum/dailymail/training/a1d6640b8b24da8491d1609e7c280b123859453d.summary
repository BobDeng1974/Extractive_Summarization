by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:54 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 14 february 2013 @entity2 unveiled plans for a ‘ @entity8 ’ raid on wealthy homeowners to fund a restoration of the 10p income tax rate yesterday			1
in his most significant economic policy announcement , the @entity10 leader said @entity13 ’s decision to abolish the starting rate of tax in 2008 had been a ‘ mistake ’			1
mr @entity2 said he wanted to re-introduce a version of it			0
tax rate : labour leader @entity2 ( pictured left , and right with shadow chancellor @entity20 , speaking to apprentices at the @entity22 ) wants to reintroduce the 10p tax rate speech : mr @entity2 today said the 10p tax rate could be paid for with a mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2m plans : shadow chancellor @entity20 ( left ) has offered to sit down with the @entity28 to work out how the mansion tax could be brought in however , his proposals came under broad attack last night amid doubts over how much his proposed ‘ mansion tax ’ would raise			1
the @entity34 , the @entity36 ’s leading economic forecaster , said mr @entity2 ’s proposal had ‘ no plausible economic justification ’ , while @entity39 said it had clearly been ‘ cobbled together overnight ’			0
treasury sources said that everyone who had paid the old 10p rate of tax already paid no tax at all , thanks to the @entity47 ’s decision to increase the threshold for income tax to £ 9,440			1
in a speech in @entity51 , mr @entity2 endorsed @entity28 proposals – blocked by the @entity53 – for an annual levy on properties worth £ 2million or more			2
rebuild : mr @entity2 and mr @entity20 speak to apprentices at the @entity22 , following the speech on @entity10 's plans for rebuilding the economy if they were to regain power unexpected : the announcement on the 10p tax rate was a surprise inclusion in the address today , which had been billed as featuring no significant policy workers : mr @entity2 said the move would put @entity10 ' where it should always have been - on the side of working people ' on wednesday , @entity39 strongly hinted that he was thinking of reinstating the 10p tax band so disastrously scrapped by @entity13			1
so how did that cynical opportunist @entity2 respond ? he stole the idea and inserted it , at the 11th hour , into yesterday ’s otherwise utterly lacklustre speech on the economy			0
to pay for it , he then went rummaging through the @entity28 policy book , disinterring @entity79 ’s unworkable plan for a ‘ mansion tax ’			1
as we have long argued , it would be impossible to introduce such a levy without punishing widows or pensioners who live in larger homes , but have only a modest income			0
what is most depressing however , is mr @entity2 ’s refusal to acknowledge that , if @entity36 is to emerge from recession , it must encourage entrepreneurs – not clobber them with punitive taxes			0
he said it would be used to create a new 10p tax band , the size of which would be determined by how much revenue was raised			2
however , aides said that mr @entity2 envisaged a 10p tax band on up to the first £ 1,000 of income above the tax - free threshold – worth £ 100 a year to 23.5million basic rate taxpayers			1
the threshold for the 40p band would be reduced to ensure that higher rate taxpayers do not benefit – sucking more families into that tax band			2
‘ we would tax houses worth over £ 2million , ’ mr @entity2 said			2
‘ and we would use the money to cut taxes for working people			0
‘ we would put right a mistake made by @entity13 and the last @entity114			2
’ the @entity34 said that to raise sufficient sums to pay for a 10p band covering the first £ 1,000 of income , an annual levy of £ 30,000 would have to be raised from every homeowner with a property worth £ 2million or more			0
there would also need to be a nationwide revaluation of property values , at least at the top end			0
critics said this would mean the return of council ‘ snoopers ’ logging every detail of people ’s homes that might increase their worth			0
mr @entity2 ’s move came a day after mr @entity39 mocked him in the @entity135 , reading out an invitation to his speech which warned that it would contain no new policy announcements			0
the prime minister also hinted that the @entity53 might reintroduce a 10p starting rate of tax , an idea which has been considered in the @entity143 for some time			1
budget : @entity53 backbenchers want the 10p rate to be brought back in next month 's budget			1
taking questions in the @entity149 mr @entity39 appeared to hint he was open to the idea campaigning in the @entity153 byelection , the prime minister said he was not worried about mr @entity2 ’s pledge			0
@entity10 denied @entity53 claims that mr @entity2 ’s tax plan had been hastily assembled , saying they had been working on it for months			1
in 2008 , mr @entity2 defended @entity10 ’s abolition of the 10p tax band , saying : ‘ some people do lose out ... but overall these changes make the tax system fairer			1
’ where is the brotherly love ? : @entity2 's plans would mean that his house , left , would just miss out on having to pay the tax at a value of £ 1.9 million , whereas his brother @entity39 's house , right , would be taxed at £ 2.3 million the @entity34 said that the proposal would ‘ complicate the income tax system and achieve nothing that could not be better achieved in other ways ’ , pointing out that governments of both complexions had introduced and then abolished lower starting rates of tax			2
‘ to propose the same thing again suggests a remarkable failure to learn from history , ’ the institute added			0
' mistake ' : @entity2 ( left ) today said the former prime minister @entity13 ( right ) got it ' wrong ' when he scrapped the 10p tax rate in 2007			1

@entity10 leader claims 10p rate could be funded through mansion tax
he *accused* @entity13 of getting it ' wrong ' when he scrapped rate
@entity53 backbenchers have been campaigning for 10p rate to be brought back in next month 's budget
