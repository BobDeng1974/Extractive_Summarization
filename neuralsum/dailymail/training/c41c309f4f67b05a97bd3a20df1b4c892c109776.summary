the iconic @entity1 train service between @entity2 in the @entity3 and @entity4 has been named as one of the best six railway adventures in the world			1
the service , which is known as @entity1 , has been placed in the same group of great train rides as the @entity11 , the @entity12 through the heart of @entity14 , the @entity15 between @entity16 and @entity17 , the @entity18 in @entity20 's stunning @entity19 and the @entity21 between @entity22 and @entity23			1
top travel guide @entity24 said the @entity1 was one of the world 's ' most unforgettable train adventures			1
pictured : a train crossing the @entity36 in @entity37 the train journey takes visitors to the picturesque @entity40 and @entity41 ( seen here ) the sleeper service also travels across @entity44 ( pictured ) to the west of @entity46 ' there are only two sleeper services left in the @entity49 , one of them wending its way slowly from @entity4 to @entity52			1
this 13 - hour route is the more stunning ... hurtling through the night and hitting @entity54 in the early hours so you can peek at a city waking up , ' it says			1
' from here it 's non-stop on the sensational photo opps : misty @entity40 cradled by mountains ; the wildly beautiful expanse of wind - blown @entity44			1
the @entity21 , @entity22 to @entity23 2			0
the @entity11 , @entity64 6			0
the @entity1 , @entity37 ' at old @entity67 station platforms , lonely tearooms survey the tracks			1
beyond , velvety green hills are washed with weak sun. ' go in spring , when the light and flowers lend the surroundings extra special beauty - and be prepared for a tight squeeze , as the cabins are n't very spacious			2
' the guide recommends that passengers watch out for @entity79 - gateway to the wild moor , which is ' so remote that rail is pretty much the only way to get there			2
' ' your nose will be superglued to the window as you take in the faded purple heathland and the chiffon - like silhouettes of foggy hills beyond , ' it says and the guide adds : ' if you opt for a bargain first class ticket , you 'll get your own cabin and wake to breakfast delivered by your own on - board steward , so there 's no need to fear stale teacakes and over-brewed tea			2
' the journey from @entity2 to @entity103 is also widely considered one of @entity49 's most scenic areas other top train journey options include the @entity107 in @entity11 , @entity64 the @entity108 , which runs through the heart of @entity14 , also topped @entity24 's list of the best railways the @entity1 connects @entity112 nightly - except saturday - to @entity113 , @entity54 , @entity2 , @entity114 and @entity115 , as well as intermediate stations			1
but it was the route to @entity2 that won over @entity24 's train lovers			1
as of may 2014 , @entity119 have taken over the franchise from the @entity113 - based @entity121			0
the company already offers luxury sleeper services in @entity124			0
the new 15 - year franchise will start in april 2015			2
@entity119 will be responsible for operating all aspects of the @entity1 including marketing , sales , passenger services , station facilities and fleet maintenance			2
more than £ 100m will be invested into building 72 state of the art carriages , which will make up four new trains , at a cost of £ 100m by the summer of 2018			0
it will be part - funded by a £ 60m grant from the @entity3 government			0
the @entity18 is likewise not to be missed			0
this train runs along @entity20 's @entity19 in @entity63 , climb aboard the @entity15 between @entity16 and @entity17 , says the travel guide travel between @entity22 and @entity23 on the iconic @entity21 - the last of the world 's top six train trips @entity119 is promising improvements including en - suite berths , ' pod flatbeds ' and a brasserie - style club car			1
and a partnership with luxury hospitality firm @entity148 and @entity150 - starred chef @entity149 will introduce what is described as ' hotel - style service and an improved all - round travelling experience			0
' announcing the new contract earlier this year , @entity37 transport minister @entity154 said the aim was to ' transform this iconic rail service			0
' he added : ' the contract secures the future of the @entity1 , ensuring it delivers a service fit for the 21st century and that it provides - as it has done for over 100 years - a unique , valued and high profile overnight service between @entity37 and @entity4			1
' around 270,000 journeys were made on the sleeper service in the last year alone			1
just sold to @entity119 , the @entity1 is set to undergo improvements to the tune of a £ 100m investment but rail workers union the @entity167 has said it is ' deeply concerned ' that the contract had been given to @entity119			2
acting general secretary @entity171 said : ' this is a company with a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services			0
' quite frankly , with their appalling list of failures in the @entity49 and globally , they should never have even been considered as contenders for the @entity3 sleeper service			0
' the logical option of public ownership was not even looked at			0
' @entity119 is a company that has a reputation for promising the earth and delivering quite the opposite as they seek to maximise profits and sweat their assets for every single penny piece			0
