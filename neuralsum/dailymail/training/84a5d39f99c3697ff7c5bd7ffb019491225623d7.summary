@entity0 loves it , @entity2 's a fan and even @entity3 likes a game			0
now @entity5 , the online game played by 200 million people worldwide , has been given the royal seal of approval too			2
the @entity10 has teamed up with makers @entity11 in a bid to raise awareness of the plight of the pangolin			1
pangolins - or scaly anteaters - will appear in an @entity5 tournament over the next seven days , with @entity19 calling for more to be done to save the animals			1
' the humble pangolin , a scaly anteater , is one of the most endangered animals on the planet because of poaching , ' he said			1
' the pangolin runs the risk of becoming extinct before most people have even heard of them			0
' pangolins are the world 's only fully scaly mammal but numbers have gone into freefall in recent years , thanks in no small part to poaching			2
the animals , which live mostly in @entity52 and south - east @entity53 , are considered a delicacy and are also in high demand for use in traditional medicine , as well as for use in home decoration			1
as a result , the animals now boast the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most trafficked species in the world , with an estimated one million individuals taken from the wild in the last decade according to the @entity68 ( @entity68 )			2
endangered : the pangolin is considered a delicious delicacy in its native @entity52 and @entity72 animal lover : @entity19 , seen here inspecting a bilby at @entity75 , has long supported conservation efforts giving it a go : prince @entity19 tries his hand at the new @entity5 pangolin game so marked has the decline in their numbers become , all eight species of pangolin were added to the @entity68 's ' @entity86 ' during the summer , which means they are at imminent risk of extinction			1
' all eight pangolin species are now listed as threatened with extinction , largely because they are being illegally traded to @entity52 and @entity72 , ' said professor @entity91 , co-chair of the @entity92 , following the announcement in july			1
' in the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction â€“ there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue			0
' the @entity10 is president of an umbrella charity called @entity102 , which aims to tackle poaching , whether of pangolins or of larger animals such as rhinos and elephants			2
' as president of @entity111 , i am working with some of the world 's largest conservation organisations to fight the illegal wildlife trade , ' he added			0
important work : the pangolin is critically endangered thanks to near constant poaching lucky : this pangolin was rescued but many more are killed to be used in traditional @entity52 medicine awareness : @entity19 , @entity122 and the @entity123 are all supporters of @entity111 for wildlife ' this criminal trade is responsible for the illegal slaughter of tens of thousands of animals a year , famously elephant and rhino			1
' these species are being pushed to the brink of extinction due to poaching			0
these magnificent creatures will die out in the wild during my lifetime if we do not take notice now			0
' the @entity10 hopes that this week 's @entity5 tournament , which follows a similar effort with the game @entity141 earlier this year on behalf of rhinos , will encourage more people to get involved and spread the word about pangolins			1
' i would love your help to spread the message about this crisis			0
it may sound trivial set against other world problems , but it is an important part of the jigsaw - and it is one that you can do something about			0
' there is evidence that poaching funds criminal gangs , even terrorist organisations , and it deprives ancient communities of their heritage and livelihoods			0
' by spreading the message about poaching , i hope you can be part of a movement that says no to poached ivory and rhino horn , and many other animal parts			2
