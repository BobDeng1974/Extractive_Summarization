@entity0 has rubbished @entity2 â€™s claim of a bullying culture in the @entity5 dressing room - and suggested that the sacked batsman has been guilty of bullying @entity7			1
in his autobiography , @entity2 claimed that @entity5 's bowlers ruled with fear and demanded apologies for fielding mistakes			2
@entity0 on monday called the suggestions ' codswallop ' before learning on tuesday that an @entity5 document on @entity2 's behaviour alleges that the @entity17 had referred to him as a ' c * * t '			1
@entity0 ( background ) has rubbished @entity2 's claims of bullying in the @entity5 camp @entity2 , pictured during the last @entity24 series , told his side of the story in his new autobiography @entity0 was given light treatment compared to wicket - keeper @entity7 , though , with @entity2 reserving most of his personal criticism for the @entity33 man			1
but , according to @entity0 , bowlers knew where the line was and , in his opinion , @entity2 's assassination of @entity7 can be considered as bullying			1
' there was absolutely no bullying			0
sure , bowlers shout at fielders if they are out of position or not concentrating , ' he wrote in @entity45 ' a bowler or wicketkeeper delivers a bit of a kick up the backside - just like a goalkeeper shouts at his centre - half			0
this is international sport , not the under - 11s			0
@entity2 , pictured celebrating @entity5 's ashes win in 2011 with @entity7 , reserving personal criticism for the @entity33 man in his new book @entity57 blasts former @entity5 ' regime ' ' if @entity2 or other players ca n't take a b * * * * * king for being unprofessional , for being out of position or seemingly not trying , they are in the wrong business			1
i must stress bowlers never had a go at fielders for dropping catches or a genuine mistake			0
it was when somebody was out of position or too busy waving to the crowd			0
' @entity0 did concede that @entity2 's claims that @entity76 ' cracked ' during a game in @entity78 after such an incident carried some truth , but insisted that @entity2 had ' misinterpreted ' things			1
it is @entity2 's words about prior which anger @entity0 the most , though			1
known as ' @entity85 ' in the @entity5 squad , @entity2 accuses prior of being a back - stabber , ' horrendous ' and ' embarrassing ' amongst other things			2
@entity0 feels his criticism is unfair , considering it was prior who actively sought @entity2 's reintergration into the @entity5 team after the text-gate scandal of 2012			1
' it is @entity2 's attacks on @entity97 and ( @entity98 ) flower that really annoy me			2
@entity7 is the most passionate bloke about protecting the team environment			0
he was the voice of the dressing room , ' he added			0
' @entity2 obviously does n't realise @entity7 was the guy who really fought to get him back in the team after the @entity105 messages business in 2012			2
' @entity7 was the one guy telling everyone we must work with @entity2 , that he 's a brilliant batsman and we need his talent			2
cheese was the one bloke who picked up the phone to @entity2			0
@entity0 , pictured celebrating with @entity2 in 2008 , feels his former @entity5 team - mate has been unfair ' now @entity2 has written a whole chapter assassinating him , even having a pop at him for taking his bike to @entity116			1
@entity2 's attack on @entity7 is , dare i say it , a bit like bullying			1
' speaking at a question and answer session in @entity124 on tuesday , @entity2 accused @entity0 of letting @entity5 down when he left last winter 's @entity125 to retire through injury			1
upon getting back from @entity127 , @entity0 praised @entity2 's attitude on tour , and stands by that viewpoint			1
@entity2 attack on former @entity5 head coach @entity132 ( right ) has also angered @entity0 ' i 've said all along that @entity2 was fine in @entity127 until the point i left the tour before the @entity136 , ' he added			2
' so what changed ? it must have something to do with @entity7 and flower because he seems to have a vendetta			0
and , of course , he has a book to sell			0
' well , there is one ever - present feature in all this			0
@entity2 should n't be called @entity2 , he should be called cd - common denominator			0
