by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 : 06:59 est , 1 february 2014 assault : @entity4 , pictured , tried to rape the unnamed 24 - year - old			1
she was left with scars the victim of a brutal sex attack has been refused @entity10 funding for ‘ cosmetic ’ treatment of her injuries			1
the decision comes less than a year after an aspiring glamour model revealed her cosmetic breast enlargement had been paid for by the @entity10			1
a 24 - year - old graphic designer was walking home from a nightclub in @entity19 when she was followed by a stranger , dragged under a bridge and assaulted			1
she managed to make a brief 999 call and police sent to the location found the man attempting to rape her			0
the terrified woman , who can not be identified , suffered bruising and grazes to her legs , knees and back in the attack last march , which left her needing hospital treatment			0
she still has painful purple scars on her knees and marks on her ankles			2
she remains traumatised by her ordeal but was told that treatment to remove the scars – a permanent reminder of the assault – can not be funded by the @entity10 because they are ‘ cosmetic ’			1
there were no such qualms about paying the £ 4,800 bill for @entity44 , 23 , from @entity45 , to have a breast enlargement operation			1
@entity47 was recommended by her gp after she complained she had been bullied since her teenage years for having a flat chest			0
miss @entity44 , an unmarried mother - of - two , was condemned when she showed off her figure in downmarket newspapers in the hope of launching a modelling career			1
she later said she wanted the @entity10 to pay for a reduction and even threatened to sue the @entity10 for making her breasts too big			2
the funding decision caused outrage , particularly as @entity10 guidelines state that cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘ to protect a person ’s health ’			1
a sex assault victim 's injuries were n't treated on the @entity10 because they are ' cosmetic '			1
but @entity44 , pictured , won funding for breast implants last year			1
she has since said she regretted billing the @entity10 similarly , there are a range of methods to reduce or remove scars – including laser treatment – which are not widely available on the @entity10 as they are regarded as purely ‘ cosmetic ’			1
the sex assault victim has been given steroid cream for the scarring on her legs , back and hands , but said yesterday she would like to have laser treatment to remove them			0
however , her gp told her there was little chance of approval			0
priorities ? @entity44 , pictured , had the operation last year			2
she now wants to pay for a reduction months have passed , nothing has been done and no @entity10 laser treatment offered , but she is yet to be told her application has been formally rejected			2
she asked : ‘ why can people have boob jobs on the @entity10 ? ‘ fair enough if i had fallen over , but i had no control over what happened to me			2
it frustrates me when i see people getting surgery through the @entity10 when they do n’t really need it			0
’ to make matters worse for the 24 - year - old , her @entity96 attacker is costing taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds while he awaits sentence , receiving the best psychiatric care in a £ 500 - a - day private hospital			2
@entity4 , 25 , pleaded guilty last april to attempted rape			1
he is currently being assessed by psychiatrists and has appeared in court 11 times			0
when he is next up before the judge , the bill for his treatment , legal and prison costs will have reached an estimated £ 90,000			0
speaking after the latest hearing at @entity114 , his victim said : ‘ there is all this fuss about his care and how much it is costing , but what about my care ? i have to see my injuries every day , yet my surgery is considered cosmetic			0
it is appalling that i get left behind			0
’ her attacker is spending 12 weeks in @entity128 , a secure psychiatric hospital in @entity129 owned by the @entity130			0
it is reported to cost around £ 500 a day , though the company will not discuss fees charged to local authorities			0
the victim said she never goes out any more , adding : ‘ i am not the same as i used to be			0

graphic designer , 24 , still has painful scars after an attempted rape in @entity19
but the scars will not be treated on the @entity10 because they are ' cosmetic '
yet funding for similarly ' cosmetic ' treatment - 36dd breast implants - was approved last year for @entity44 from @entity45 to ' boost *confidence* '
