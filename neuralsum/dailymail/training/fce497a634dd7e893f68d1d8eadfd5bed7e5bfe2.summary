@entity0 will have to put his hopes of a money - spinning unification clash on hold , even if he beats world champion @entity5 on saturday night			1
@entity0 faces the @entity6 for the second time in front of 16,000 fans at a specially built arena in @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
but even if he delivers a repeat of his knockout early last year , the @entity12 must face mandatory challenger @entity15 , rather than the likes of @entity17 or @entity18			1
centre stage : the @entity21 super-bantamweight world champion @entity5 ( second left ) and the number one contender @entity0 ( second right ) pose with @entity23 during a press conference in @entity11 overlooking : @entity0 will fight @entity5 at the @entity10 ( background ) in @entity11 anticipation : @entity0 and @entity5 were at the @entity27 for their pre-fight press conference @entity29 has teamed up with @entity32 ’s @entity31 company and must get his shot at the winner within 90 days			1
ironically , @entity32 promoted @entity0 until they split last year			2
but the 27 - year - old is firmly focused on winning a world title after two decades in the sport			1
‘ it ’s going to be a dream come true to win the world title			1
i started this long journey at seven years old and had my ups and downs , so to become a world champion in my 20th year of doing this sport , in a stadium built for myself - it ’s what dreams are made of , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t think you ’ve seen the best of me			0
i ’m 27 , in the prime of my life but there ’s still plenty more to come			0
i can see and feel the improvements everyday in training and after sparring			0
the best is definitely yet to come			0
’ getting in the swing : @entity0 entertains the crowd at an event in @entity61 before the fight stare down : crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of @entity0 before his @entity11 fight thumbs up from me : @entity0 poses with fans at a public workout in @entity61 in the other corner : @entity5 will be looking to defend his world title when he faces @entity0 sign here please : @entity5 signs an autograph for a fan in @entity61 as he prepares to defend his title @entity5 bounced back from his loss to @entity0 in stunning style by stopping the undefeated @entity78 @entity77 , stripping him of his @entity21 belt			1
@entity0 , though , is n’t expecting anything different this time around from the 28 - year - old @entity6			2
‘ i think this is his 35th or 36th fight and every single one of his fights he has boxed the same way			0
he comes - forward , he ’s aggressive and has an exciting style that the crowds like , ’ he added , ‘ i think our styles clash well and make for a good fight but i do n’t see him doing anything different and expect him to come head first , trying to knock me out			0
‘ but it ’s up to me to remain smart and switched on for the twelve rounds and as long as i stay focused there ’s only going to be one winner			2
‘ i ’m preparing for a hard , gruelling fight , that may take 12 rounds but no matter what happens i ’m going to win			2
i also know i have the power to knock any super-bantamweight in the world out			0
‘ so it could be a 12 - round points decision or it could be over in the first round			0
nevertheless , i ’m preparing for a very hard and brutal fight then we can talk about future fights			0
’ @entity0 vs @entity5 is live on @entity109 this saturday at 7pm			1
