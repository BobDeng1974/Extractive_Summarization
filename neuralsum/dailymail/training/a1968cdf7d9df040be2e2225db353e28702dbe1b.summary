by @entity1 reporter published : 10:14 est , 11 february 2014 @entity3 : 13:50 est , 11 february 2014 a gold medalist @entity5 freestyle skier had only one person that he wanted to celebrate with after completing his near - perfect run in @entity9 : his disabled brother			1
@entity10 has spoken countless times about how he is so close with his brother @entity12 , who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at a young age and told he would not be able to walk beyond the age of 12 , yet more than 15 years later he is still able to do so			1
when 26 - year - old @entity10 made the final stop at the end of the mountain on monday night , he immediately ran over to his brother and pulled him over the barrier so that they could celebrate together			1
new record : @entity10 ( left ) became the first moguls skier to win two @entity25 golds in freestyle skiing inspiration : @entity10 ( left ) says that his brother @entity12 ( right ) is his everyday inspiration because of the challenges that he has moving together : as soon as he finished the run , @entity10 ran over to his brother and lifted him from behind the security barrier so that they could celebrate together shot to fame : @entity10 's first gold came in 2010 and his brother @entity12 has become something of a celebrity in the disabled community in @entity5 because of the awareness he has raised ' just like you or i , he has dreams and most of them are not realisable to him but he does dream about it , he talks about it and he never complains that it 's not realistic to him , ’ @entity10 said of his brother			1
' every day i feel very lucky to be a normal person that has the chance to go after his dreams , and he does n't have that chance			0
so out of respect to him , i need to go after that and with his motivation he would be four - time @entity25 champion			0
' it 's crazy the motivation that he takes and every step is very hard for him			0
in life , i have an easy path and i need to go out there and do the best i can just out of respect to him			0
' he lives his dreams through me			0
( two gold medals ) is the least i can do , he 's my every day inspiration			0
' big deal : monday night ¿ s gold means that @entity10 has become the first moguls skier with multiple @entity25 medals as well as three world championship golds in dual moguls going for it : @entity10 is seen here during his last jump in the run on monday night strong showing : @entity10 won and his close competitor and fellow @entity5 @entity78 came in second while @entity81 's @entity80 came in third although @entity12 briefly slipped over , his brother lifted him back onto his feet			1
the freestyle skiing was a clean sweep for @entity10 ’s homeland , with two of the three top spots going to @entity5 with his frequent competitor @entity78 who came in second			1
' when i 'm on the hill ( @entity95 ) is in my mind and he 's pushing me to be a better skier , but outside of the hill , whether i 'm in university or training or whatever i do in life , my brother is my every day inspiration , ' @entity10 said			2
monday night ’s gold means that @entity10 has become the first moguls skier with multiple @entity25 medals as well as three world championship golds in dual moguls - though he was never able to become individual champion , settling twice for silver			2
he previously announced that he would retire at the @entity111 season and predicted @entity95 would take over his mantle once he 's gone			0
so happy : his girlfriend @entity113 also greeted him at the finish line heartwarming : the brotherly love between @entity10 and @entity12 has added an emotional element to his story			2
