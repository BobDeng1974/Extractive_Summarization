by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 16:44 est , 23 january 2013 likening sexual assault in the @entity6 's ranks to a cancer , the service 's top officer resolved wednesday to tackle the problem by screening personnel more carefully and putting an end to bad behaviors like binge drinking that can lead to misconduct			1
but gen. @entity14 , the @entity6 chief of staff , underscored the challenge by telling a @entity17 oversight committee that the service recorded a disturbing number of reports of sexual assault last year even as it worked to curb misconduct in the wake of a sex scandal at its training headquarters in @entity25			1
dozens of young female recruits and airmen at @entity29 near @entity30 were victimized by their instructors who sexually harassed , improperly touched or raped them			1
' why , on what was undoubtedly the worst day of a victim 's life , did they not turn to us for help ? ' @entity14 said during testimony before the @entity51			0
' we are missing something fundamental in the human - to - human interaction that will allow them to feel safe enough to come to us and report			0
' an @entity6 veteran who was sexually assaulted while serving — but not at @entity29 — described how intimidating it is for young enlisted personnel to speak up			1
' you 're stuck , ' @entity59 told the committee			0
' if you want a career , you do n't want to say anything because you get retaliated against			0
' @entity64 , who said she medically retired in 2010 with post-traumatic stress disorder , said the @entity6 and the other military branches have a sexual assault epidemic and a broken system of justice			1
the scandal at @entity29 , now known as @entity72 - @entity29 , continues to unfold nearly two years after the first victim came forward			1
all @entity75 airmen report to @entity29 for basic training			1
the base has about 500 military training instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year			2
about 1 in 5 recruits is a woman ; most instructors are men			1
retired air force technical sgt. @entity59 , left , grew emotional as she testified about being repeatedly sexually assaulted during her first two years of active duty the initial results of @entity6 investigation released in november described abuses of power by instructors who took advantage of a weak oversight system to prey on young recruits			1
the inquiry has found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at @entity29 , according to the @entity6			1

two more received nonjudicial punishments			0

@entity118 , who testified along with @entity38 , said more women are being placed in supervisory roles within the training command			0
the @entity29 scandal has not affected recruiting , @entity118 said			2

the preliminary figures for 2012 show there were nearly 800 reports of cases , ranging from inappropriate touching to rape , according to @entity38 's testimony			1
that would be a nearly 30 percent increase from 2011 , when 614 cases were reported			2
the number could be much greater , @entity14 said , because many cases are never reported			2
' it 's astonishing , really , ' @entity14 said			0
' eight hundred is not acceptable , 600 is not acceptable			0
zero is the only answer			0
' the 2012 figures are being audited and reviewed before being included in a report the @entity146 will submit to @entity37 in april , according to @entity38			2
@entity38 said he has stressed to the @entity6 's officer corps and senior enlisted ranks the importance of eliminating sexual misconduct			0
as part of that effort , @entity38 issued a ' letter to @entity155 ' this month that said images , songs and stories that are obscene or vulgar are not part of the @entity6 heritage			0
not everyone who commits sexual assault is a predator , but there are predators in the ranks and they have to be found before they act , @entity38 said			1
the @entity6 also has to identify and stop the activities that can lead to inappropriate actions			0
' a young man who routinely binge drinks and loses control of himself is going to conduct bad behavior , ' @entity14 said			0
' that bad behavior could result in sexual assault			1
let 's stop the binge drinking			0
