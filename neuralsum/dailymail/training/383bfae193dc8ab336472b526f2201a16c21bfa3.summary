the @entity1 government today resigned , brought down by a spying and corruption scandal that shook the tiny country better known for wealthy bankers than political intrigue			0
@entity7 , prime minister since 1995 and the @entity9 's longest serving government chief , tendered his resignation to @entity11 , the royal head of state who himself has been implicated in media reports of espionage			1
the government was forced to resign after junior coalition partners withdrew their support in protest at @entity7 's apparent failure to rein in a secret service spiralling out of control			1
@entity7 has proposed holding a general election in october , seven months ahead of schedule			2
accused : @entity11 ( left ) was implicated in espionage reports that led to the downfall of @entity7 ( right ) the catalyst for the resignation was a parliamentary inquiry published last week that said @entity1 's security agency illegally bugged politicians and members of the public , purchased cars for private use and took payments and favours in exchange for access to influential officials			1
in a scene reminiscent of a spy novel , former security chief @entity38 recorded a conversation with @entity7 in 2008 using a microphone in his watch			1
@entity38 told @entity7 he had reliable reports that @entity11 was in constant contact with @entity47 's secret services , according to one newspaper			1
the @entity50 's office has denied the allegation			0
the government was already under pressure due to renewed interest in a mysterious series of sabotage bomb attacks in the 1980s , known as the @entity58 affair , whose targets included electricity pylons and an airport radar system as well as a newspaper office			0
two former members of a special police force went on trial for the attacks at the start of this year			0
last month , the government and finance minister @entity69 survived twin votes of no - confidence in parliament over accusations that the minister had put pressure on investigators to close their inquiry into the bombings			2
@entity7 , for almost two decades the personification of @entity1 on the international stage , chairing " @entity82 " meetings of euro zone finance ministers from 2005 to 2013 , may well return to lead the @entity83 after the snap election			2
he remains a popular figure and has no obvious successor in his centre - right @entity88 party , particularly as the former finance minister has been tarnished , according to @entity90 , politics lecturer at the @entity91			0
@entity69 , once touted as a possible future prime minister , has also come under fire over the re-purchase of a stake in @entity96 from @entity97 in january and @entity9 pressure to end @entity1 's system of bank secrecy			1
" the @entity88 crown price for many years , @entity69 , is himself involved in the telephone tapping and @entity104 affairs , " @entity90 said			0
" @entity7 is the electoral locomotive of his party			0
it 's not the @entity88 , it 's the @entity7 party			2
