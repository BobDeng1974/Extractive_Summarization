by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 10:43 est , 1 november 2012 a taekwondo black belt used her martial arts training to fight off a deadly tiger shark while taking a leisurely swim off the coast of @entity7			1
@entity8 had been swimming with turtles and was just 25 feet from shore with her husband , @entity11 , when she came face - to - face with the 12 - foot shark			1
her reflex reaction was to throw some punches at the predator , and she managed to catch it flush on the nose – forcing it to turn and swim in the opposite direction			0
right on the nose : @entity8 ( left ) demonstrated how she threw punches at the tiger shark to scare it away as she returned from a swim with her husband , @entity11 ( right ) leisurely : @entity8 and @entity11 had been swimming with turtles of the coast of @entity28 island @entity7 ‘ all of a sudden , it was like @entity30			1
you see the big jaws coming at you , ’ @entity8 said			1
‘ i ca n't say how terrifying that is			0
’ but @entity8 , who was holidaying on the @entity28 island , did not escape the scuffle unscathed			2
she needed 60 to 70 stitches in her hand after a punch slipped off the side of the tiger shark ’s snout and into its jaws			1
@entity8 was not bitten by the shark , but its razor - sharp teeth left a sizeable gash on her hand			1
ouch : @entity8 needed between 60 and 70 stitches after she landed a punch before her hand slipped into the shark 's mouth brave : @entity8 , a black belt in taekwondo , credits her martial arts training for teaching her how to throw a punch a @entity58 surfer who survived a shark attack says he punched the beast in the head until it finally released him			1
@entity62 says the great white pulled him underwater on tuesday at a popular surf spot and let him go only after receiving the blows to its head			2
doctors say @entity62 suffered at least seven deep lacerations , but none of his vital organs were damaged and was recovering well on wednesday			2
the 25 - year - old thanked the doctors who operated on him and strangers who came to his aid			0
@entity62 says the attack will not discourage him from getting back in the water and surfing again			1
‘ i punched it twice with this hand , ’ she told @entity80 as she held up her bandaged wrist			2
she added : ‘ i punched it this way , and that one contacted			0
but this ( punch ) kind of hit the side and slid into the mouth			0
‘ i credit my training in martial arts , my taekwondo , to prepare me to learn how to punch			1
’ after the shark had retreated , the couple , from @entity93 , @entity58 , were able to swim safely to shore			1
although @entity8 thanks her quick reflexes and taekwondo training , @entity11 believes the couple were fortunate to escape alive			2
he said : ‘ i think we were really lucky			0
’ tiger sharks , named because of the dark stripes found on the side of their bodies , have been known to attack humans before			0
these sharks have gained a reputation for eating anything , and will target smaller fish , turtles and even types of dolphin as food			0
but @entity11 is refusing to let the terrifying experience he and @entity8 endured keep them out of the sea for long			0
he said : ‘ i 've always told my kids there 's zero reasons to fear sharks because what is scary is breast cancer			0
that is one in eight			0
‘ getting bitten by a shark is one in 4 million to visitors to @entity127 , so we should not have to worry at all			0
’ the one - two : @entity8 hit the shark a couple of times before it decided to turn and swim away from the couple colossal : the shark that strayed too close to @entity8 ( not pictured ) is similar to the one above video : @entity8 recounts her terrifying tale			1

@entity8 says she punched shark in snout to scare it away as she swam off coast of @entity7
