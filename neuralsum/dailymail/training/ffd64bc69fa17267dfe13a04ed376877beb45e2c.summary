by @entity0 the water level in a key @entity3 aquifer has hit a historic low as drought continues to ravage the state - leaving local leaders scrambling for ways to convince @entity9 to cut back on their water use			2
the @entity11 is down by more than 163billion gallons - about 500,000 acre - feet , from its maximum level , @entity14 , the manager for the @entity15 , told the @entity16			0
it 's the lowest level ever recorded - lower than the previous record set in 1964 , which came after 20 years of drought			0
@entity20 , the giant regional reservoir in @entity22 , has been dramatically drained by the massive drought that is afflicting nearly all of @entity3 the aquifer is a key source of water for much of the @entity28 , a sprawling metropolitan region with 4.2million people			1
' this is nâ€™t just an issue for @entity15 , but many other cities depend on this basin for much of their water supply , including @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity22 , ' water resource manager @entity30 told the @entity16			1
exacerbating the problem is that communities that normally sell the @entity28 excess water are cutting back deliveries as they are squeezed by drought , as well			2
despite the crisis - more than 80percent of @entity3 is in extreme drought and more than a third of the state is experiencing expectational drought ' ( the worst classification ) - many @entity9 do n't seem to be terribly conscious of where their water comes from			1
more than 80percent of @entity3 is in extreme drought and more than a third is suffering ' exceptional drought ' - the worst classification a new survey shows that less than five percent of residents of the @entity28 know that nearly a third of the water they consume is imported from other areas			1
earlier this month , officials were shocked to find that after announcing water conservation measures , many @entity3 areas reported an increase in water usage			0
in the nearby @entity68 in @entity22 , officials announced they could begin to limit the amount of water being pumped out of the aquifer there over concern that it could be sucked so dry that it would never recover when the rains finally return .			0

the @entity11 supplies water to much of the @entity28 of @entity3 and its 4.2million residents
cities like @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity22 are feeling the squeeze
80percent of @entity3 is under ' extreme ' drought *conditions*
