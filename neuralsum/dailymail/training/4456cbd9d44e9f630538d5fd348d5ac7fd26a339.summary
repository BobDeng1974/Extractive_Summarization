by @entity0 blasted : @entity1 admits it has had to stock cheap drinks to lure customers to the store @entity1 has been accused of fuelling @entity7 ’s binge drinking culture by selling cheap alcohol in its stores alongside cosmetics			1
the retailer , better known for beauty products and in - store pharmacies , admitted it has resorted to stocking cheap wine , beer and alcopops to entice customers into struggling outlets			1
but a @entity19 mp last night branded its decision irresponsible and called on @entity1 to take the booze off the shelves – accusing the firm of targeting younger customers with its alcohol promotions			1
in a branch in @entity29 , @entity30 , customers can buy bottles of wine for just £ 2.49 , while a brand of peach schnapps is on sale for just £ 4.49 – almost £ 2.50 cheaper than the same drink in @entity37			1
the town ’s mp @entity38 , chairwoman of the @entity40 on @entity41 , said : ‘ i ’m very disappointed because this is n’t what their core selling is about			1
they ’re about health and beauty products			2
‘ they are clearly marketing at young , female consumers and i do n’t think it ’s a responsible thing to do			2
i share the concerns about cheap booze in supermarkets and @entity1 is contributing to the issue of people pre-loading before they go out in an evening			2
‘ they should remove alcohol from their stores			2
‘ other shops might follow @entity1 ’s lead , which will be damaging for our @entity61 and wo n’t help us , as a nation , deal with young people binge drinking on cheap booze			2
’ her call was backed last night by crime prevention minister @entity67 , who said : ‘ it is not impressive to see a national chain specialising in medicines and health care now dealing in alcohol sales			0
' industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking – and retailers have to recognise they have a significant part to play			0
’ mp @entity38 has attacked the move as ' irresponsible ' and a fuel for dangerous binge - drinking culture the attack comes after supermarkets were criticised for using cheap drink promotions to attract customers			1
prime minister @entity85 has pledged to crack down on promotional deals , which he blamed for increasing anti-social behaviour turning town centres into the ‘ @entity89 ’			1
another @entity1 outlet in @entity91 , @entity92 , is selling @entity95 red , white and rose wine for £ 4.19			1
meanwhile 70cl bottles of the alcopop @entity97 , which sell for £ 2.50 in most supermarkets , are promoted as ‘ great value ’ at £ 1.79			1
a store assistant said : ‘ @entity101 was under £ 4 recently and the shelves were soon empty			1
we had to order more			0
we had @entity104 in december and that went quickly			0
’ but @entity1 managing director @entity106 defended the alcohol sales , saying it was the only way to stop some branches closing down			0
crime prevention minister @entity67 and @entity110 have also blasted the prices for encouraging ' pre-loading ' , when teenagers drink before going out in a letter responding to concerns raised by ms @entity38 about the @entity29 branch , he wrote : ‘ we sell alcoholic drinks in a very small number of our stores – only six out of 870			1
' there is one reason for the sale of alcohol in these stores – to drive footfall and sales as the six are significant loss - making stores and at serious risk of closure			0
‘ it is the last resort to save the jobs of our people			0
’ @entity1 insisted the branches in question do not have pharmacies			0
but responsible drinking campaigners said @entity1 should not be treating alcoholic beverages like another product to increase profits			0
@entity110 ’s @entity141 said : ‘ should shops be selling alcopops and wine beside shampoos and mascaras ? this sends out the wrong message about alcohol – it ’s not just any product , it can be harmful , addictive and dangerous			1
' with alcohol now sold in @entity1 , @entity153 and a pub on the @entity155 , we would ask the government whether their licensing rules need to be reconsidered			0
’ today @entity1 backtracked over its decision to sell alcohol			0
a spokesman said : ' we have decided to cease selling alcohol in the five @entity1 stores which currently offer this range			2
' the introduction of this category into a very small number of stores was a trial to see if this was a product area our customers wanted us to stock , to ensure the continued viability of these stores and to safeguard jobs on the high street			0
