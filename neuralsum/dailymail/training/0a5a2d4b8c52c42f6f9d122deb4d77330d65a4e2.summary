by @entity1 reporter when @entity2 fell ill on his honeymoon , he chalked it up to a wedding - based hangover			1
but nine months , three hospitals and six cardiac arrests later , he is now awaiting a heart transplant after his body was ravaged by a virus			1
mr @entity2 , 33 , collapsed hours after arriving in the @entity12 with his wife @entity13 , also 33 , last november			1
@entity2 ( right ) developed myocarditis shortly after marrying his wife @entity13 ( left )			1
he was on his honeymoon in the @entity12 when his condition rapidly deteriorated			1
he is now waiting for a heart transplant after spending nine months in three different hospitals the keen triathlete and squash player initally blamed it on a hangover , or some dodgy plane food – but his condition swiftly deteriorated			2
within days , he had lost two stone and was transferred to a hospital in @entity27 , @entity28 , where he was put on life - support			1
‘ i finally came round and was so confused , ’ he said			0
‘ i pointed for a pen and paper and wrote : “ did i die ? ” i later learned i had five cardiac failures in the @entity12 , and a sixth a few days later			2
’ when he first fell ill , mr @entity2 ’s wife called for the local doctor , and her husband was eventually put on a drip in his hut			1
island doctors told @entity2 they had 24 hours to get him to a specialist heart hospital in @entity27 ( pictured there during his recovery ) or he would die			1
he was flown there on an emergency medical jet and remained on life support for two weeks and in the hospital for a total of six weeks			1
the next day the couple took a boat to the nearest hospital , where mr @entity2 was found to have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute			1
he was then sedated and given defibrillation shocks			1
‘ it all happened completely out of the blue and was absolutely terrifying , ’ mrs @entity54 recalled			0
myocarditis is a viral infection that leads to inflammation and damage to the heart			0
the majority of cases clear up within a week , but sometimes the inflammation in the heart lasts longer			0
symptoms include chest pain , fever , an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath			0
there ’s no reason why someone with an infection may develop myocarditis - it is often a case of bad luck			0
many people do n’t realise it , but common bacterial and viral infections such as flu , ear and chest infections , and even the common cold can get into the bloodstream and affect the heart , explains consultant cardiologist dr @entity90 of @entity91			0
‘ it ’s more widespread than we ’d thought - a quarter of patients we see aged 30 to 35 have evidence of myocarditis , and it is the most common cause of sudden adult death			0
myocarditis can be mild and sometimes resolves itself - if the condition is spotted quickly , anti-inflammatory drugs can treat it			2
but once the heart muscle becomes enlarged , causing it to stretch , there is little that can be done and it can lead to heart failure			0
‘ i was on the phone to family and friends back at home most of the time , who really kept me going			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ at one point our medical insurance had n’t kicked in and our credit cards were maxed - out			2
‘ @entity13 had been given a security escort from the hotel , and he saw the situation was so serious that he gave the hospital the deeds to his house as security against my treatment			0
’ doctors warned mr @entity2 , a director of @entity129 , that he would die unless they got him to a specialist heart hospital in @entity27 within 24 hours			1
thankfully , he was flown there on an emergency medical jet , and was placed on life - support for two weeks			1
his other organs began to fail as doctors worked out which drugs would combat the virus ; when his kidneys stopped working , hospital staff drained 11 litres of fluid from his body			1
however , after several weeks he became stable enough to fly home , and was taken to @entity143 in north - west @entity144			2
‘ i was told i had picked up a virus which attacked my heart and caused it to inflame , which is incredibly rare , ’ he said			0
staff fitted him with a cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillator ( @entity150 ) to moderate the pace of his heart			2
‘ i was eventually able to leave the hospital and was at home for seven weeks , but i collapsed at @entity156 and was taken back , ’ he said			1
mr @entity2 then had eight hours of open heart surgery , and was fitted with a left ventricular assist device , which sucks in blood and sends it through the heart			1
he is now stable , and in hospital awaiting a heart transplant			2
before being struck down by the viral infection , @entity2 had always had a passion for fitness - playing squash from a young age			2
shortly before his wedding he had even attended a triathlon training camp in the @entity172			0
he is pictured in the hospital garden while he waits for a transplant when @entity2 was stable enough to get another medical flight home , he was taken to @entity143 in @entity144			1
there they fitted a @entity180 device ( pictured in his x-ray ) to help pace his heart and within 48 hours he felt much better @entity2 ( pictured shortly after his operation to fit a defibrillator ) is now waiting for a heart transplant			1
he will have to live in hospital until he receives a new heart			2
@entity13 visits him every day after work and the couple have dinner together his wife , a recruitment consultant , visits him every day after work with dinner , which they eat together			0
the couple are now urging people to register as organ donors to help people like them			0
‘ despite all that has happened , i count myself lucky , ’ mr @entity2 said			0
‘ i have an amazing family , and met people who show the world is full of people that care for strangers			0
’ when he regains full health , he hopes to become squash champion at the @entity209 – the @entity210 for transplant recipients .			0

@entity2 developed myocarditis while on honeymoon in @entity12
his heart rate rose to 200 beats - a - minute so was sedated and given defibrillation shocks to force his heart back to a normal rhythm
he was transferred to a larger hospital in @entity27 , @entity28 , where he was put on a life support machine for two weeks
his other organs quickly started to fail and doctors had to drain 11 litres of fluid from his body when his kidneys stopped working
now home , with a defibrillator device fitted , he needs a transplant to survive in the long - term and must live in hospital until her finds a donor
