@entity0 today accused tv presenter @entity1 of ‘ belittling ’ people with mental health problems			1
the @entity5 leader used a speech in central @entity7 to criticise the @entity9 host , who he claimed was responsible for promoting a culture of ‘ intolerance ’			1
mr @entity12 said stars were wrong to make light of mental illness , as he unveiled plans to tackle what he called ‘ the biggest unaddressed health challenge of our age ’			1
but he said ‘ far too often ’ there was ‘ scepticism and abuse ’ that reinforced the taboo about mental health meaning many people who struggle with it do not feel able to discuss it or seek help			1
‘ it 's not just casual name calling in the streets or the school playground			2
there are still people who abuse the privilege of their celebrity to insult , demean and belittle others , ’ he said in a speech at the @entity25			1
he added : ‘ @entity1 , who may have at least have acknowledged the tragedy of people who end their own lives , goes on to call them " @entity60 " whose bodies should be left on train tracks rather than delay journeys			2
‘ it is attitudes like these that reinforce the stigma that blights millions of people 's lives , and holds our country back			2
' the fight against racism , against sexism and against homophobia , made the acceptable unacceptable			2
so we should join the fight against this intolerance			2
it is wrong , it costs @entity82 dear , and it has to change			0
’ mr @entity0 criticised celebrities like @entity9 presenter @entity1 who made fun of people with a mental illness @entity1 caused controversy last december after criticising people who kill themselves on train lines			1
the notorious presenter said that anyone who committed suicide in this way was ' very selfish ' for traumatising train drivers and inconveniencing commuters			0
the outburst came just days after a joke about executing public sector workers for going on strike cause outcry			0
in a newspaper column he wrote that killing oneself by jumping in front of a train ' is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense			0
' he went on to label those who killed themselves ' @entity110 '			0
@entity1 claimed that train drivers involved in these cases are ' traumatised for life ' , and complained that passengers would ' have to sit around for hours '			0
and he added that trains should not wait until all the remains of the body had been removed from tracks , saying - grotesquely - that drivers should instead ' get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller , gooey parts that are far away and hard to find			0
' however , in his article for @entity125 mr @entity1 stressed that he had ' the deepest sympathy for anyone whose life is so mangled and messed up that they believe death 's icy embrace will be better			0
he accepted that politicians had also largely failed to take a lead on the issue			0
‘ for far too long leading politicians from all parties , including my own , have maintained an almost complete silence about mental health , ’ he said			1
mental illness creates additional costs for the @entity141 of £ 10 billion in the provision of extra physical care , while the wider economy loses £ 26 billion a year to sickness absence , replacing staff and reduced productivity caused , he said			1
' now there will be some people who say that mental health is the kind of subject we can talk about in the good times , but not when the economy is such a priority			1
' in my view , that is the opposite of the truth			0
because mental health is an economic challenge holding back prosperity			1
' because however hard the economic challenges , we can not forget about people 's quality of life			0
and , finally , if we want a politics that talks directly to the challenges that @entity82 people face in their everyday lives , we can not allow the silence to continue			0
' mr @entity0 announced the creation of a taskforce headed by the chair of @entity176 , @entity177 , to draw up a strategic plan for mental health in society			1
