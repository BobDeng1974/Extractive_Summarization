for most of us , starting a family comes after marriage and meeting a man but as a new study has revealed , that is no longer always the case			2
the number of single women opting to make their dreams of motherhood a reality using @entity12 has doubled , with 632 women choosing to go it alone in 2012 compared to just 259 in 2007			1
donor insemination has also become a popular option , with 468 women choosing that route to motherhood in 2012 according to the @entity19 [ @entity19 ]			1
increase : between 2007 and 2012 , the number of single women undergoing @entity12 treatment doubled going it alone : more women are choosing to take control of their fertility and opt for single motherhood in total , 47,800 women had @entity12 treatment in 2012 ; 2.3 per cent of whom were singletons , while three per cent involved women in same sex relationships			1
experts have put the rise in singletons going it alone down to women becoming more willing to take responsibility for their own fertility			1
speaking to the @entity39 , professor @entity40 , medical director at @entity41 , a private fertility clinic , said : ' women are taking control of their own reproduction as much as they took control when the oral contraceptive pill was introduced			1
' we are seeing [ everyone from ] affluent career women to women who have no money and their parents or grandparents are paying for them			1
' but it seems not everyone is pleased by the development , with dr @entity58 , head of the @entity59 , an anti-abortion evangelist organisation , admitting to having some concern about the impact growing up in a single parent family has on children			2
' many solo parents do a sterling job against tremendous odds but for the optimal environment for the emotional and spiritual development of children is to be with two married parents of the opposite sex to whom they are biologically related			0
' others said that the importance to a child of having a father is frequently underestimated and should be taken into account			0
' around a quarter of families do n't fit the traditional mum , dad and children , all living in the same house model , ' said @entity83 , joint chief executive at the @entity84			0

' where fathers are truly absent , children are likely to need extra support			0
' despite the warnings , singletons , among them neonatal nurse @entity105 , 35 , from @entity106 look set to continue going alone in pursuit motherhood			0
@entity105 , now the mother of 14 - month - old twin boys @entity110 and @entity111 , says life as a single mother is tough but rewarding			2
' i 'd never met the right man , ' she explains			0
' i went to the clinic to check my fertility and it was low so i decided if i had n't met a man within a year , i would do it on my own			2
' ' my boys can find out who their dad is when they are 18 and i would n't have done it if i did n't have that option , ' she adds			0
