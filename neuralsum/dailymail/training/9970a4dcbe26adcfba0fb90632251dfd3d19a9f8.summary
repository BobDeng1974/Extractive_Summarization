by @entity0 published : 16:57 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 11 july 2013 last saturday evening she started terrorising us again			1
i was in the sitting room with my three sons , @entity6 16 , @entity7 , ten , and @entity8 , eight , when the all - too - familiar wailing started			1
we 'd just settled down with a @entity11 takeaway to watch @entity12 , excited about a lovely evening together after seeing off the smallest member of our family , six - year - old @entity15 , on a sleepover			1
' see you tomorrow , ' we trilled at her , waving her off			1
then , out of earshot , the boys let out a whoop of delight			1
my little madam : lucy with her six - year - old daughter @entity25 @entity26 would undoubtedly have started screaming before we 'd even sat down			1
she would probably have refused the meal before announcing she would n't watch a ' boys ' movie - demanding something like @entity32 instead			1
because although @entity15 may look angelic , she acts like a little demon			1
she shouts and wails , caterwauling for hours if she does n't get what she wants			1
and she never wants to go to bed			1
after hours spent coaxing and cajoling her , i inevitably lose my temper , possibly even pushing her up the stairs , from where her screams can last up to an hour			1
so , most saturday nights , we run out of time to do anything together at all			1
but this time i had managed to persuade a friend to take @entity26 for the night - promising endless babysitting ( in fact , almost having to pay her )			1
she has a daughter the same age ( a lovely , well - behaved one ) and , weirdly , our two girls seem to get on			1
what could go wrong ? i was so looking forward to spending time with my sons			1
the boys and i are a harmonious unit when left alone , but we had only just settled down for some crispy duck when we heard it outside : the unmistakeable sound of my daughter shouting her head off			1
' what 's that ? ' asked @entity8 , nervously			1
' is it @entity26 ? ' said a panicky @entity7			1
@entity6 calmly reached for the remote control and turned the volume up			1
' just ignore it , ' he said			1
' it 's our ears playing tricks on us			1
' a little demon : she scratches , she shouts , and wails			1
and she never wants to go to bed			2
two minutes later there was a frantic banging on the front door			2
and there , on the doorstep , was my little girl , red - eyed and screaming			2
' i want @entity84 ! ' she wailed , inconsolably			2
my friend , standing beside her , shrugged , looking desperate			2
' sorry , ' she said			2
' she just would n't settle			2
' in one fell swoop our lovely evening was destroyed - just like every other evening and almost every other day			2
i could n't help reminding myself , i had wanted this - i did everything i could to ensure i got a girl after three boys			2
although every expectant mother insists she does n't care what sex her child is , when surveyed last year , 45 per cent of women admitted they longed for a girl			2
i even bought a @entity97 gender selection ' kit ' off the internet , containing a thermometer so i could plot my ovulation days and strict advice on my diet and even the position in which i had sex			2
did it work ? who can tell			2
all i know is that @entity15 , my longed - for little girl , arrived nine months later			1
this all came to mind when i was listening last week to a debate on whether gender selection , for social reasons , should be made legal in the @entity113			2
a leading medical ethicist feels it should			2
' be careful what you wish for ! ' i shouted at the radio			2
my @entity26 seemed to hit the terrible twos and never leave them behind			2
whereas my sons are sweetness and light , @entity15 is loud , noisy , screechy and demanding			1
we live in a state of shock - a six - year - old girl 's version of martial law			2
everything with her is a trial : from washing her hair ( she hates that ) to cutting her nails ( she hates that even more ) to getting her dressed ( this invokes hours of screaming )			0
and so we all creep around her - it 's like treading on eggshells stuffed with @entity137			0
i 've tried to put my foot down , but @entity15 has defied everything			1
one day i yelled ( in extreme frustration ) : ' right that 's it ! i am going to smack you ! ' ' oh are you ? ' she said , cool as a cucumber			0
' go on then - and see if i care			0
' she then proffered up her bottom in such an insouciant way that the fire in my belly was quenched			0
but we still all love her to death			0
she is the apple of my eye , and her brothers could not be kinder			1
but how does she repay them ? with routine physical and verbal abuse			0
@entity8 , she attacks - biting and scratching			0
@entity7 is so kind to her it makes me want to weep when she turns on him and screams : ' go away , @entity164 ! ' even @entity6 , who is possessed of almost super-human levels of sangfroid , has given up on her			0
this is not how it was supposed to be			0
for years , all i ever wanted was a baby girl			0
i had visions of us shopping together , reading @entity173 , pressing blossom , maybe riding ponies and horses			0
so i was in shock when i had @entity6			0
i was even more in shock when i had two more boys			0
my life turned into one long paean to @entity182 and pulling legs off spiders			0
oh brother : @entity26 's brothers are well - behaved , in contrast to their out - of - control sister i 'd almost given up on having a girl until i stumbled on a website filled with old wives ' tales that promised to guarantee one			1
soon , i was cutting down on protein and bulking up on carbs and dairy to decrease the acidity of my womb , before insisting my then - husband and i ( we separated 18 months ago ) made love in the missionary position - afterwards lying prone for an hour to give the ' female ' swimmers the best chance of success			0
when i found i was pregnant with a daughter , i was so happy i cried for days			1
and after i gave birth in april 2007 , i spent days on end marvelling at her			1
a girl ! a girl ! yes , @entity15 has completed our family , but not quite in the way i expected			1
i love her so much my bones hurt , but i have never experienced anything as exhausting as her			0
i thought i knew how to do this mothering lark , but @entity26 's behaviour drives me to tears			0
i am sure she has been sent here to teach us all a lesson			0
i 'm just not sure what that is			0
now , i have been through all the reasons why she might be such a handful			0
is it because she is the only girl ? she complains she has ' no one to play with ' and wishes she has a sister			0
this is not going to happen			0
it 's not as if she wants for attention			0
her brothers think she is spoiled because i spend so much time and money satiating her desire for pink plastic tat			1
her room is full of dolls and dressing - up clothes			0
@entity245 : there 's no doubt @entity15 is a handful - but why ? she has a constant stream of friends round for playdates and sleepovers - although she often screams at them so badly that they ask , tearfully , if they can go home			1
i wonder if it 's all because she 's the baby of the family			0
but i am the youngest of four and not at all like that			0
my mother says i was a bit bossy , but not in @entity15 's league			1
then i feel the terrible guilt at the fact that her father and i have separated			0
she is very much a @entity267 's girl , and the past 18 months must have been terrible for her			0
but @entity15 sees her father a lot and her behaviour is no worse than before we split			1
i have done a straw poll of other mums and the simple answer seems to be that it is an age thing			0
three friends of mine have told me how bossy their daughters are compared with their sons - so much so , that one of them is even sending her girl off to boarding school as soon as she turns seven			0
when i tell my male friends about her behaviour , they snigger : ' do you know yourself at all ? ' one said to me , raising an eyebrow			0
perhaps i was a little horror and my mother just does n't want to tell me			0
or maybe i was so dreadful , she 's simply blocked it all out			0
we 'll always love @entity15 to bits			1
but i wish she would carry on being herself - only less so			0
we all need some peace .			0

@entity292 pined for a daughter and was *overjoyed* when she gave birth to one
but now all @entity15 , 6 , ever does is scream , wail and scratch her brothers
her siblings are angelic , so why is @entity15 such a terror ?
