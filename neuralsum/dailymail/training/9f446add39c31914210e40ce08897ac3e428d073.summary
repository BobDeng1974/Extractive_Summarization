by @entity0 @entity1 is the first of @entity5 's hard - won @entity4 cheerleaders to start bailing water , in a 180 - degree shift from comments just 24 hours age @entity1 today said he will not back a use - of - force resolution to be voted on by lawmakers – less than 24 hours after warning of a ' catastrophic ' end to president @entity5 's @entity14 saga if @entity15 refused to back the proposal			1
the @entity4 senator for @entity18 said it was a mistake for the president to approach legislators in the first place , and said he believes the resolution is too weak in its current form			1
but @entity5 shot back from across the @entity26 ocean during a trip to @entity28 that @entity15 should do more than ' sit on the sidelines [ and ] snipe			1
' a resolution crafted by @entity34 @entity33 sen. @entity32 and @entity36 @entity35 sen. @entity35 would limit military action to 90 days , and would make no provision for @entity40 ground troops entering @entity14			1
a @entity1 aide told mailonline wednesday that the senator ' does not support ' that resolution			1
@entity1 would vote ' no , ' he said on @entity45 's today show , if his only other option was ' to do something that really does n’t change anything – in other words , some token strikes , and then some time later , [ @entity51 ] uses those chemical weapons again			1
' ' what then ? go through the same routine ? ' speaking during a press conference with prime minister @entity55 of @entity28 , @entity5 insisted he ultimately does not need @entity15 ' permission to strike @entity14 , even though he has asked for it			1
some of those weapons were used against @entity14 civilians in late august @entity5 and @entity28 prime minister @entity55 are meeting in @entity71 ahead of the upcoming @entity73 summit ' as commander in chief , i always preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of @entity40 ’s national security , ' @entity5 said			1
' i do not believe that i was required to take this to @entity15 ... i did not take this to @entity15 just because it ’s an empty exercise ; i think it ’s important to have @entity15 ’s support on it			1
' in @entity83 , @entity1 said that @entity15 should only support measures that can ' reverse the situation on the battlefield			1
' ' it 's an unfair fight			0
@entity89 weapons are pouring in , @entity91 weapons are pouring in			0
have no doubt , this is a proxy war , and the @entity91 are the ones who will gain or lose by this			0
' ' i have to see the concrete action ' from the @entity5 administration , he said on the @entity102 program			2
' and it 's not that i do n't trust the word of the president			0
' it 's just that i need to see the concrete measures that are going to be taken			0
' ' and if we do n't take those concrete measures and if the resolution does n't allow it , then obviously i ca n’t support it			2
it ’s almost as bad as not passing a resolution , is passing a resolution that does n’t allow us to take action that reverses the situation on the battlefield so that @entity51 will sooner or later leave			2
the only way he ’s going to leave is if he thinks he ’s losing			0
' @entity5 announced saturday that he would take the unusual step of asking for congressional approval before engaging in a limited bombing campaign in @entity14			1
@entity1 said wednesday morning that this was a mistake			2
hundreds of children were among the more than 1,400 killed by what @entity40 officials have called a sarin nerve gas attack in the @entity130 neighborhood of @entity131 on august 21 protesters in northern @entity14 carried banners on aug. 30 during a demonstration calling for international action against the @entity51 regime ' once he announced that we were going to have strikes , i think he should have acted , as other presidents have , both @entity4 or @entity141 , ' @entity1 said			1
' but it is what it is			0
the word of the @entity146 is out there in the world that we will not stand him crossing a red line			0
and not only did he say that , he said that there would be strikes against those persecutors			0
' sens. @entity32 and @entity35 have floated a proposal that would outline the conditions for @entity40 bombing campaigns in @entity14			2
' the president is authorized ... to use the @entity161 as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in a limited and tailored manner against legitimate military targets in @entity14 , ' it reads			0
action could be taken ' only to : ( 1 ) respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction by the @entity14 government in the conflict in @entity14 ; ( 2 ) deter @entity14 ’s use of such weapons in order to protect the national security interests of the @entity40 and to protect our allies and partners against the use of such weapons ; and ( 3 ) degrade @entity14 ’s capacity to use such weapons in the future			2
' most critically , @entity15 would ' not authorize the use of the @entity161 on the ground in @entity14 for the purpose of combat operations			2
' the authorization would expire in 60 days , but president @entity5 would have the option to extend it a single time for another 30 days			0
' so then for the @entity40 to do nothing will have a ripple effect all over the world			0
' @entity5 said wednesday that bringing the matter to @entity15 had been ' brewing in my mind for some time , ' suggesting that it was part of his broader @entity197 plan long before he made the surprising public announcement			1
in @entity28 , the president claimed that his 2012 ' red line ' speech , in which he warned @entity51 that the use of chemical weapons would have dire consequences , was also a conscious tactic			0
' that was n't something i just kind of made up , ' @entity5 said			2
' i did n't just pluck it out of thin air			0
' he insisted that ' my credibility 's not on the line			0
' ' the international community 's credibility is on the line , ' @entity5 said , ' and @entity40 's and @entity15 's credibility 's on the line			1
' ' i did n't set a red line , ' @entity5 said			2
' the world set a red line			0
' and @entity15 , he claimed , ' set a red line when it ratified that treaty			0
' @entity5 added that he ' believe [ s ] that @entity15 will approve it ' a resolution , but maintained that ' i do not believe that i was required to take this to @entity15			1
' the president , who received the @entity229 , declined to answer a question about whether he would bomb @entity14 on his own if @entity15 declines to approve military action			1
what a difference a day makes : @entity1 ( @entity234 ) and sen. @entity235 ( r ) said yesterday that president @entity5 made them comfortable with his plan to attack the @entity14 regime ' they call him the @entity240 ... ' -- @entity1 was calling a $ 100 bet ( in fake money ) as secretary of state @entity243 made the case for bombing @entity14 cruise missiles ' arrival on targets there , however , might happen far more quickly than other @entity40 shipments of @entity14 - related war materiel			1
the @entity251 reported tuesday night that three months after the @entity252 authorized the @entity253 to arm some of the resistance fighters opposing the @entity51 regime , they are still waiting			0
the delay was attributed to an abundance of caution in ensuring the weapons do n't fall into the hands of other resistance elements who identify with extremist jihadi causes			0
@entity1 has made news three times in the past 24 hours , including his initial declaration tuesday that it would be ' catastrophic ' if @entity15 withheld its support from the @entity252 , and an @entity270 photographer 's snapshot of him playing poker on his @entity272 during a marathon @entity274 hearing on the matter .			1

in @entity28 , @entity5 warns @entity15 not to ' sit on the sidelines [ and ] snipe '
a current draft resolution in the @entity274 does n't include any ground troops , and would limit military action to a 90 - day window
a day after @entity1 said congressional *inaction* would be ' catastrophic ' for @entity40 , his office *concedes* that he ' does not support ' the proposal
@entity5 insists that he does n't need @entity15 ' approval , but @entity1 fires back that going to @entity291 instead of taking action was a mistake
