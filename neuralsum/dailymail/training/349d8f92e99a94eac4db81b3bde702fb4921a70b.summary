you no longer need to be a spy like @entity2 to get your hands on an amphibious car			1
@entity5 has designed the world 's fastest jeep - style vehicle that can be driven straight from the land into the water and goes from a car to a boat in just 15 seconds			1
called the @entity13 , the vehicle can reach water speeds of up to 45mph - almost as fast as an average speedboat - and is fitted with a custom - made 3.7 litre v6 engine , fibreglass hull and lightweight chromoly steel chassis			1
it is capable of reaching water speeds of up to 45mph - almost as fast as an average speedboat - plus can be driven up to 80mph on land the panther can be driven straight from the land into the water and goes from a car to a boat in just 15 seconds			1
the wheels are lifted into the chassis using hydraulics and the car switches to a boat using a ' jet drive ' lever weight : 2950 lbs height : 69 " windshield up , 51 " windshield down , 44 " windshield down , wheels retracted length : 180 " width : 72 " water speed : 44 mph land speed : 80 + mph passengers : 4 engine : @entity52 3.7 liter @entity53 transmission : 4 speed manual @entity56 : @entity57 brakes : four wheel disc wheel retraction : @entity61 fuel : 91 @entity63 cooling system : closed with marine heat exchanger it is also capable of reaching speeds of 80mph on land			1
@entity2 , played by sir @entity69 , famously drove an amphibious @entity70 from the land into the sea during the 1976 film @entity73			2
@entity75 partner @entity74 , 66 , from @entity76 , @entity21 spent 11 years fine - turning the machine before he felt ready to put it on the market			0
the panther 's design is based on a @entity82 , however , because the chassis of the @entity82 was too heavy for the water , the @entity13 's lightweight chassis is made of chromoly steel			1
once in the water , the panther is remarkably stable for a boat that is only 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) in length			1
' we 've been working for years and years to be able to get these to perform like a boat on the water and like a car on the street , ' march told @entity96			1
march has done his best to test out the vehicle and made his first trip to the @entity100 last saturday			0
' going on the road for 15 miles and then being able to hit the water and go 30 miles across with nothing breaking and just cruising across … made it in an hour and 10 minutes on 10 gallons of gas , ' said march			2
the panther 's chromoly steel chassis was designed to slip into a fibreglass hull			0
the hull is also filled with closed - cell styrofoam to help the car stay afloat			2
the engine for the panther is the latest - generation @entity114 3.7 - liter vtec v - 6 engine , custom - fitted with aluminium parts , a overhead camshaft cylinder head and 24 valves the panther was designed by @entity75 partner @entity74 , from @entity21			2
@entity74 spent 11 years fine - turning the machine			0
the panther 's design is based on a @entity82 , however , because the chassis of the @entity82 is heavy , the @entity13 's lightweight chassis is made of chromoly steel the panther 's chassis was designed to slip into a fibreglass hull - similar to those used on @entity131 cars			1
the hull is also filled with closed - cell styrofoam to help the car stay afloat			2
the engine for the panther is the latest - generation @entity114 3.7 - liter vtec v - 6 engine , custom - fitted with aluminium parts , a overhead camshaft cylinder head and 24 valves			2
both intake and exhaust valves are controlled by @entity114 's @entity141 and lift @entity142 ( @entity53 ) system			0
this engine produces 305 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and on land the @entity13 can reach speeds of around 80mph			2
the panther weighs 2950lbs and is 15ft long			0
as a boat , the amphibious vehicle is powered by a panther marine propulsion jet			1
it needs to be travelling at around 15mph to get enough momentum to enter the water @entity75 's @entity13 car can carry up to four passengers in both land and water mode			1
the vehicle can be fitted with fishing rod holders , pictured			0
it can be sailed in both salt and fresh water and the chassis is protected from water damage it needs to be travelling at around 15mph to enter the water and can then reach top speeds of almost 45mph			1
to drive the panther in water , the driver must put the four - speed gear changer in neutral , pull a knob to switch the transfer case to ' jet drive ' , hydraulically lift the wheels and tyres out of the water , and start boating			1
this entire process takes less than 15 seconds			1
@entity13 sells for anywhere in between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 and @entity5 told @entity96 that they 've already pre-sold cars to princes in @entity185 and many @entity187 workers			1
the @entity189 chassis is a kit and additional components can be bought off the shelf			0
the turn - key minus version does n't come with an engine			0
@entity13 starts at £ 49,800 for a ' @entity195 ' , £ 70,000 for a ' turn - key minus ' version , and £ 89,000 for a complete panther			0

' @entity214 in its design and engineering , a @entity210 takes you anywhere you want to go			0
' the thrilling acceleration is provided by a @entity219			0
' you can leave the highway behind thanks to its long travel off road suspension and travel in the water courtesy of the panther jet			0
' and do all this with the security of knowing you are surrounded by a state of the art revolutionary designed composite body			0
@entity2 , played by sir @entity69 , famously drove an amphibious @entity70 , pictured , from the land into the sea during the 1976 film @entity73 ' nothing compares to driving a panther			1
' the design looks like a four - wheel drive and the bodywork is made from a fibreglass chassis that is capable of withstanding salt - water			2
the outboard motor which powers the car is capable of travelling 2000,000 miles before needing serious maintenance			0
' you will be absolutely blown away by the panther , ' said @entity74			0
' our @entity75 team did a fabulous job of creating an extraordinary vehicle that is exciting , raw fun , yet incredibly practical			0

the panther reaches water speeds of 45mph - as fast as a speedboat
it can be driven straight from the land into water
the amphibious design goes from a car to a boat in just 15 seconds
the @entity82 - style vehicle costs $ 100,000 to $ 200,000
the car has been per - ordered for @entity185 princes and @entity187 workers
