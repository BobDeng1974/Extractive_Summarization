baffled motorists in @entity12 were surprised to see the bird perched on eggs in between the red and amber signals			0
even more aptly it appeared this early bird had used some @entity19 wrapping ribbon to help it make its nest			1
photographer @entity21 , 40 , from @entity12 , said the bird had chosen a set of traffic lights in @entity6			1
he said : ' there were a lot of people standing around looking at this bird , i suppose it thought it had the green light to start nesting so early			1
' if you look closely you can see ribbon from what might be @entity19 wrapping in with the twigs in the nest ' i was there for about half an hour and the bird seemed pretty happy and oblivious to all the commotion around it			2
' @entity38 , from the @entity39 , said the bird was likely to be either a mistle or song thrush			1
she said : ' birds make their nests in all sorts of unusual places , and this is n't the first traffic light nest we 've seen - in the past we 've had birds nesting in , bins , hanging baskets and even an ash tray outside a pub. ' it may seem odd to us , but it 's actually quite common			2
they see a safe , secure and cosy spot to lay eggs and raise chicks and do n't care what it looks like or what the neighbours might think			0
' this nest might not seem like an obvious choice , but perhaps the warmth from the lights makes it a sensible one			0
' it 's hard to tell if this bird is a song or mistle thrush without seeing its chest			0
both are early breeders and have two to three broods a year			0
' they normally start late february so this is pretty early			0
the mild weather towards the end of last year and beginning of this one may have prompted them to nest , but the current cold snap will have given them a bit of a shock			1
' the @entity39 recommends putting out high energy foods in gardens to help your birds get through the winter			0
a supply of unfrozen , fresh water is also really important			0
' @entity38 said with the @entity39 's @entity89 coming up on the weekend of january 26 and 27 , keeping your feeders , tables and bird baths topped - up will not only make sure your garden visitors are well fed and looked after , it will also encourage them into your garden just in time for you to take part in the world 's biggest wildlife survey			2
photographer @entity21 captured the images of the bird , as it appeared to be blissfully unaware of the interest it had caused by choosing its unusual nesting place			1
