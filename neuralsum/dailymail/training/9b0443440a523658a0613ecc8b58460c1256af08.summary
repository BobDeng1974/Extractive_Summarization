@entity0 would love to compete against @entity1 in this week 's @entity2 , but hinted that the 14 - time major winner would be better off taking a lengthy break from the game			1
woods withdrew from the @entity7 during sunday 's final round , the former world number one looking in severe pain from his back after hitting his tee shot on the ninth hole			1
the 38 - year - old was playing only his third tournament since undergoing back surgery on march 31 and has yet to announce if he will able to play at @entity17 , the venue where he won the @entity20 @entity2 in 2000 in a play - off with @entity22			1
' obviously everybody wants him to be back at golf tournaments , ' said @entity0 , whose eight - shot win at @entity37 in june came without @entity1 in the field			1
' if you win a big tournament without @entity1 in the field you still feel very happy about it , but you want to play against him and it 's nice if he 's part of every tournament			2
' he brings a lot of people into it			0
it has a different flair			0
when @entity1 's playing in a golf tournament there 's more entertainment and more people			2
' it 's such a shame that he had to pull out last week and i hope , and everybody hopes , that he will come back and play this week			0
on the other hand , i do n't know how bad his injury is			0
wish : @entity0 would love to compete against @entity1 in this week 's @entity2 @entity60 ready for @entity2 touch and go : @entity6 could still play in the tournament but has yet to decide whether he will or not hand off the club : @entity1 withdrew from the @entity7 during sunday 's final round ' it 's tough to say			1
if i had injuries like this , i would probably make really , really sure that i 'm healthy , because he 's 38 years old , so hopefully he will have another 10 , 15 years of competing against the guys on the @entity70 and that he reaches his goal of 18 majors or maybe 19			0
' @entity1 has up until just before his tee time of 8:35am local time on thursday to decide whether to play or miss three of the year 's four majors for the first time in his career			2
knee surgery in 2008 to replace his anterior cruciate ligament - just after his last major victory in the @entity30 at @entity81 - forced him to miss the @entity30 and @entity2			0
in 2011 he failed to tee it up at the @entity30 and the @entity83 because of an @entity85 complaint			0
@entity20 @entity86 is the first reserve at @entity17 and would play alongside @entity88 and @entity89 if @entity1 withdraws .			1

@entity0 wants the former world no 1 to compete
@entity1 withdrew from the @entity7 on sunday
the @entity20 is *struggling* with a *persistent* back injury
