@entity31 , 34 , from @entity36 , came up with the idea for after before after attending an event in aid the charity surf ( supporting survivors of the @entity34 )			1
she met @entity11 and was struck by her tragic and courageous story			1
the genocide started after a plane carrying then president @entity45 - was shot down , killing everyone on board , on april 6 1994			1
@entity2 was then thrown into political unrest			1
@entity17 extremists blamed the @entity51 rebel group , the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , and waged war on the @entity51 people			1
@entity11 , who now lives in @entity12 , @entity13 was 15 at the time			1
she tells @entity54 how she climbed a tree for safety in the back garden of her uncle ’s house in @entity60 when it was ambushed by @entity17 extremists			1
inspirational : @entity32 writer and journalist @entity31 , right , was so struck by the story of @entity2 genocide survivor @entity11 , left , that she loosely based the protagonist of her new novel on @entity11 's story as @entity51 , @entity11 ’s family were all at risk , so she had been sent to live with her uncle for safety			1
but soon enough the entire family – @entity11 and her father , four brothers , 16 cousins , grandmother and two uncles and aunts – were hiding out in same house			1
@entity11 will forever be haunted by the day @entity17 militants found them			1
" they came to attack us with machetes			2
i thought at least if i ran they might shot me and i 'd die quickly rather than bleeding to death " ‘ they had to search every house to take passports , they did n’t want anyone crossing the border , ’ @entity11 tells @entity54			1
‘ they came to attack us with machetes			2
i thought at least if i ran they might shoot me and i 'd die quickly			2
‘ i was scared of the agony of the machete and bleeding slowly to death			2
’ ‘ i saw them come through the house and so ran out of the window to the backyard , hoping my family would follow me			2
i was shaking so much because i was so terrified , so could n’t run that fast or bear to look back			2
’ seeing solace in her uncle ’s avocado tree , @entity11 hid and watched , praying her family would escape as well			1
‘ from the tree i could see everything that was going on in the house , ’ she says quietly			2
i saw them all killed			0
every single one of my family in front of my eyes			0
' they pulled the bodies out and left them in the garden			0
i stayed in the tree for hours , not knowing what to do			0
i had nowhere to go and nowhere to go back to			0
’ eventually , @entity11 crawled down and ran to the nearest houses			1
‘ i started knocking on doors			0
some people closed the door in my face , others screamed			0
one woman let me stay one night in her house			0
’ the following morning @entity11 left again and was found by @entity17 militants , who chased her			1
running on instinct , she came to a pit in the ground and jumped in			0
‘ they surrounded it , screaming at me to get out , ’ she says			0
‘ i told them , “ no , if you want to kill me the best place is here , do your business			2
” one jumped inside the pit , lifted me up			0
they did n’t kill me , though			0
i think they took pity on me but i do n't know why			0
’ " i always wanted my story to be heard			0
it has given me courage			0
this is a way to learn from the past " @entity11 found another family friend , a woman who took her in and looked after her until the war was over and for years afterwards			1
the @entity50 , a trained @entity51 military group largely based in @entity150 after , were able to enter @entity2 and slowly began take - over of the country			1
only when the @entity50 had full control , did the genocide stop , in mid-july 1994			1
@entity11 grew up without a family or knowing a word of @entity157 , living in a country ravished by war and left in poverty and disarray			1
in 2000 , the family friend arranged for 20 - year - old @entity11 to be taken to @entity163 for a new and prosperous life , but arriving in @entity36 before connecting to @entity163 , @entity11 was abandoned at @entity165 , with no idea where she was supposed to go and what she was supposed to do			1
‘ authorities at the airport took me to a hotel nearby @entity165 where a translator talked to me as i could not speak a word of @entity157 , ' she says			0
‘ a social worker put us in a house for six months whilst i claimed asylum			0
i went to school for two years , learnt @entity157 , made friends and started to rebuild my life			0
’ she applied to study at @entity181 in 2004			0
after before by @entity31 is out now , published by @entity182 , £ 7.99 ‘ i made friends with a woman from @entity185 because we could both speak @entity186 and she was going to @entity187 and i told the people at the asylum hostel i was staying at that i wanted to go with her , ’ she explains			1
her asylum came through in 2005 and she began her undergraduate @entity192 and @entity194 degree in 2010 , graduating in 2013			0

@entity11 also became heavily involved with @entity203 , of which she is now a trustee			1
it was here she met writer and journalist @entity31			1
‘ i was looking for ideas for a novel and happened to go to a surf event that my husband helped to organise , ’ @entity31 tells @entity54			1
‘ i was struck by the enduring sense of betrayal in @entity2			2
it was a tight - knit community where everyone shared the same culture and language and for friend to turn on friend and neighbour to turn on neighbour seemed so shocking			0
' that really stuck with me			0
‘ i thought about other forms of betrayal and that ’s how the stories in the book came together			0
i got in touch with @entity11 who was so amazing and gave me such insight			2
’ such was the impact of @entity11 ’s story that she inspired the character of @entity33			1
@entity31 continues : ‘ @entity11 ’s voice kept coming back to me			1
the character @entity33 keeps having flashbacks to the genocide			2
i would imagine for someone who has been through that it ’s something they have to try to live with and face every day			0
‘ it ’s so important to keep talking about these things			0
by speaking and not letting the world forget , that ’s our only chance to stop these things continuing to happen			0
’ @entity11 adds : ‘ i always wanted my story to be heard			2
this is a way to learn from the past			0
i was so happy when @entity31 approached me			2
telling my story has given me courage			0
