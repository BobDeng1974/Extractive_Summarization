cascading down a nearly 200 metre drop in @entity1 , @entity2 is a breathtaking scene			1
but occasionally , when conditions permit , the magnificent waterfall is transformed into and even more spectacular sight			1
with just the right mix of water vapour and light , it becomes an ethereal rainbow haze that permeates the lush vegetation and dramatic rock faces around it			1
this spectacular phenomenon only last a few minutes , as the falling sunlight passes across the mountainous backdrop and catches the vaporised water			2
stunning rare moment : this spectacular shot was captured as the late afternoon autumn light caught the mist from @entity2 , in @entity1 , @entity23			1
this picture is just one section of the full - frame picture snapped by photographer @entity27 but for patient photographer @entity27 , it was certainly worth the wait			1
the fall , which stands at 189 metres , is famous for the mist that wafts off it when the breezes blow and which is said to resemble , as its name dictates , a bride 's flowing veil			0
@entity38 named the fall @entity39 , meaning ' spirit of the puffing wind '			0
guarding the entrance to the valley , the @entity43 tribe believed the fall was home to a vengeful spirit , and those leaving the valley would be cursed if they looked at it			0
but also , they said inhaling the mist from the fall would bring good luck to anyone looking to marry			0
photographer @entity27 was in the right place at the right time to capture this rare and magnificent moment , in @entity1 , @entity23 it 's clear to see from ms @entity27 's incredible picture why native americans believed there was more to the fall than meets the eye			1
at times , when the wind is strong , the water appears to fall sideways , and during lesser water flows , the narrow spurt completely vaporises before it reaches the bottom			0
there are a number of vantage and viewpoints set up around the park for onlookers to watch the incredible spectacle			0
but only few lucky - and patient - observers will witness quite such a breathtaking scene as this			0
the magnificent natural phenomena was also captured last year by photographer @entity82 , who was overjoyed to find himself in exactly the right place at the right time			1
natural phenomenon : a waterfall in @entity1 , @entity23 turns into a beautiful fountain of colour as sunlight reflects off its wet spray mr @entity82 , from @entity90 , @entity91 , was standing close to a cliff at the @entity94 lookout when he spotted the colourful scene			1
he said at the time : ' the sun has to be in position to get the rainbow , and this photo was not planned by me beforehand			2
i just happened to be in the right place at the right time			2
' i could n't believe how lucky i was to see such a sight , and just had to start taking pictures straight away			0
' national park : the wonder was captured by photographer @entity82 , who was overjoyed to find himself in exactly the right place at the right time mr @entity82 took hundreds of photos of the magical event			1
he said : ' i was there for about 30 minutes , snapping probably a couple of hundred photos at this particular location			0
the ideal conditions for a rainbow are the combination of sunlight and water droplets			2
this usually comes in the form of rain , but fine spray from a waterfall is often just as effective .			0

it 's a breathtaking phenomenon that only happens when water and light conditions are exactly right
@entity2 , in @entity1 , @entity23 , was transformed into an incredible ethereal rainbow
