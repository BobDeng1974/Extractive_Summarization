you wait half a lifetime to see the @entity2 , and then two come along at once			0
standing on the top step of the podium was the indestructible human - looking phenomenon of legend , and next to him stood @entity7			2
@entity9 , of course , was the second terminator , the crushing victor of the @entity13 @entity12 that gave him the perfect start in his attempt to become the first @entity17 driver to successfully defend the formula one world championship			1
he has hung about with stars of the screen , fashion and music through a winter of a paparazzo ’s dream , but here he was after 58 laps he had rendered as interesting as counting sheep , the supreme driver of the moment			0
@entity9 celebrates his @entity13 gp win in front of second - placed @entity32 and @entity33 who completed the podium @entity35 stormed to victory at the season - opening @entity13 @entity12 following a dominant performance @entity9 flew off the start - line and never looked back as he cruised to victory in the first race of the 2015 campaign @entity32 , who finished runner - up last year , kept @entity9 honest , but in truth he was no match for his @entity46 team - mate 1			1

@entity85 ( @entity74 ) @entity51 - @entity46 ( rank : r = retired , nc = not classified , ns = not started ) fastest lap : @entity9 , 01:30.945 , lap 50			1
although his @entity46 team - mate @entity32 put in some fastest laps , @entity9 seemed to be holding back , doing all he needed with measure and control			1
but for his one and only pit stop , he led throughout after effectively winning the race with a dominant pole position on saturday			0
@entity32 was second , with @entity33 third on his @entity48 debut			1
‘ @entity9 made no mistakes , ’ said @entity32			1
‘ i was n’t able to get close to him , let alone try to overtake			0
’ if there was any downside to @entity9 ’s victory it was the possibility it raised of a one - sided season , or at least , if @entity32 can find form , an internal duel			1
for these @entity46 are so invulnerable they could take you to all four corners of the @entity109 and back without so much as a splutter			2
@entity33 was 34 seconds behind @entity9 , who , on this track , put @entity113 on the map with a breathtaking first few corners of daring and precision in his debut @entity119 race eight years ago			1
the tv cameras barely focused on the @entity46 because routine genius can be boring to behold			2
pastor @entity79 crashed into the wall on the first lap of the race after he was clipped by the @entity53 of @entity52 @entity33 and @entity73 bang wheels on the run down to turn 1			2
it causes a concertina effect which ends in @entity79 crashing out @entity71 finished last , but it was a sterling effort to get his @entity72 to the finish line following the @entity17 team 's miserable winter @entity9 was clearly delighted with his win in @entity133			1
he shared a joke with @entity7 who conducted the interviews re-live every lap of the @entity133 race not only that but damaging to the sport , according to @entity56 team principal @entity139			1
he is one of the most intelligent and garlanded figures in the sport but he might be considered something of a hostile witness for @entity119 given his vested interest in the revival of his struggling team			0
but he deserves a hearing			0
‘ when we were winning — and we were never winning with an advantage that @entity46 have — double diffusers were banned , exhausts were moved , flexible bodywork was banned , engine mapping was changed mid-season , ’ said @entity139			2
‘ anything was done to pull us back			0
that was not just us ; it was done to @entity72 and @entity51 in other years			1
@entity9 and @entity32 ( right ) shake hands after the race			1
the @entity158 out - classed his team - mate at the season - opening race @entity9 holds alfot the winners ' trophy after seeing off the challenge from @entity32 to claim his sixth victory in the last seven races @entity7 conducted the podium interview , which caught @entity9 off guard as he said : ' hey man ! wow ... i thought you were taller '			1
‘ is it healthy to have a situation like this ? take nothing from @entity46 , they have done a super job			2
the problem is that the gap is so big that you end up with three - tier racing and that is not healthy for @entity119			0
‘ the @entity182 can see the power output that every engine is producing			0
they have the facts and they could quite easily come up with a way of a form of equalisation			0
’ yes , but is the pursuit of , and reward for , perfection not @entity119 ’s raison d’etre ? any late risers among the insomniac petrol - heads watching the race live early in sunday ’s @entity17 morning would have missed the greatest excitements of the day : the pre-race rate of withdrawal			2
the 30 - year - old @entity158 crosses the line to claim his first win of the season and start the season where he left off in @entity203 @entity9 sprays champagne from the rostrum as he celebrates the 34th grand prix victory of his career @entity83 , driving for the tardy @entity72 team , did not even manage to make it on to the grid			1
his @entity212 - powered engine gave up on him soon after he left the garage , sending smoke into the warm air			0
within seconds of that , @entity81 ’s @entity56 gearbox packed in			0
this was a another blow for a team already angered by engine supplier @entity55 ’s failure to improve on last year ’s power unit			0
with @entity225 not even having taken part in qualifying , and @entity51 ’ @entity85 having pulled out with a bad back , only 15 cars started the grand prix			1
although @entity9 safely negotiated the opening lap , @entity73 ’s @entity48 caught @entity52 ’s @entity53 , which then clipped pastor @entity79 ’s @entity46			1
it clunked into the wall , ending the @entity80 ’s participation			0
we were down to 14 cars			0
@entity79 ’s team - mate @entity77 was then wheeled into the garage after suffering power failure			1
@entity75 , the history - making @entity66 man , was next to go			0
‘ smoke in the car , ’ said the 17 - year - old , anxiously			0
we were down to 12			0
@entity73 ’s afternoon ended when a second shoddy pit stop left him with a barely fitted left rear wheel			0
now there were merely 11			0
@entity245 and behold , this meant @entity71 was in contention for points having started at the very back of the grid			2
but he could do no more than finish 11th and last in a @entity212 that remains in a lamentably early stage of development			0
but he believes , to borrow a phrase , they will be back .			0

@entity9 dominated the first race of the campaign to open up his championship defence with a win
@entity32 completed a @entity46 one - two , but the @entity47 was no match for his team - mate
@entity33 secured the final podium spot on his @entity48 debut with @entity49 4th for @entity51
@entity71 finished 11th and last after nursing his @entity72 home ... only 15 cars started in @entity133
