she was 19 , a brand - new mother with a developmental disability			1
two days after giving birth to her daughter , the state took the infant away and placed her in foster care			1
@entity9 child welfare officials contend the young woman could n't properly care for a newborn and insist they acted in the child 's best interests			1
but the federal government disagrees : it says the state violated her civil rights by discriminating against her because of her disability			1
in a new report , the @entity21 and the @entity23 @entity22 say the state @entity25 — which has moved to terminate the mother 's parental rights — needs to compensate her and give her a chance to prove she can care for her daughter , or it could face a federal lawsuit			1
the @entity31 , an independent federal agency advising the @entity32 and @entity33 , says the case points up a growing problem : states needlessly taking custody of the children of disabled parents			2
the @entity9 @entity25 violated the law when it took away a 19 - year - old 's two - day - old infant just because the mother was mentally disabled ' parents with disabilities are suffering significant discrimination , ' said @entity48 , an attorney for the council			1
' what happened to this mother is very common ... states are removing these children for the sole reason of their parents having a disability			2
' now 21 , and identified in the federal report only by the pseudonym ' @entity61 , ' the young woman 's ordeal began as she was still recovering from childbirth in november 2012			2
federal authorities describe her as having a ' mild intellectual disability ' that makes it difficult for her to read and follow verbal instructions			2
they say she requires ' repetition , hands - on instruction and frequency ' to learn new things such as how to feed a baby and change diapers			2
' @entity25 staff assumed that ms. @entity61 was unable to learn how to safely care for her daughter because of her disability , and , therefore , denied her the opportunity to receive meaningful assistance , ' said the two federal agencies , which conducted a joint civil rights investigation			1
their 26 - page report , dated jan. 29 , says @entity9 should provide the mother with services and support so she can have a shot at regaining custody of her daughter ; pay damages to the family ; and withdraw a petition to terminate the mother 's parental rights that 's currently in state court			1
they also called for broader changes , saying the case highlights ' systemic failures by @entity25 to ensure social workers follow appropriate policies and procedures and have necessary training to perform their duties without discriminating on the basis of disability			0
' the @entity31 has documented similar cases across the country , including a @entity111 , @entity112 , couple who had their daughter taken into state custody because they were both blind , and a quadriplegic mother in @entity118 who waged a lengthy legal battle to keep custody of her son			1
in the past , state child welfare officials have defended placing such children in foster care out of grave concerns for their adequate care and well - being			1
@entity128 , a @entity25 spokeswoman , said the agency will be responding to the federal government 's report			0
' @entity25 believes it acted in the best interest of the child , ' she said , without elaborating			0
through their lawyers , the young mother and her family declined requests by @entity139 to be interviewed			0
their lawyers said community service providers support the family 's plan to care for the little girl , who is now 2			0
the grandparents want to be designated as the child 's legal guardians and have promised to continue helping their daughter , who lives with them , learn to care for the toddler			1
' this mother has good supports			0
there are no issues of substance abuse or domestic violence , ' said @entity156 , a lawyer for the mother			0
' i have complete confidence in the ability of this family to parent this child safely			0
' @entity156 said the mother , who is working to finish her high school degree , has n't given up on her daughter — visiting her regularly and taking courses to improve her parenting skills			2
' she has been resilient			0
she 's been disappointed at nearly every turn by the court and the department , ' @entity156 said			0
' but she has never stopped trying			0
a lesser person would have given up by now			0

@entity9 child welfare services took a two - day - old infant away from her disabled mother and placed her in foster care
the state holds that the woman , who has a developmental disability , is unfit to properly care for the child
now , federal officials say the woman must be compensated and given a chance to prove she can raise her daughter
