by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 28 march 2014 updated : 17:30 est , 28 march 2014 exotic yet easy to care for , it 's no wonder @entity2 are the country 's most popular houseplant , accounting for a whopping 50 per cent of the market			1
you might imagine that these elegant plants - also known as moth orchids - are bred in steamily tropical climes before being imported to @entity9 , but actually , many of the orchids we buy are grown here			1
even more surprisingly , they all start their life in a decidedly unglamorous test tube			1
a decade ago , orchids were an expensive treat : the only way to propagate them was by seed and it took years to bring an orchid to maturity			1
phalaenopsis orchids at @entity25 in @entity26 all that changed with the invention of micropropagation , a cloning technique which allows a small section of flowering stem to be replicated in a laboratory			0
suddenly orchids could be produced in just two years and , as prices plummeted , demand soared			0
although there are thousands of different varieties of orchids , it 's the @entity2 , with their upright stems and open flowers , that we 've fallen in love with			1
one of the big orchid growers in the @entity9 is @entity25 in @entity26 , which recently celebrated more than 50 years in business			1
it supplies plants to @entity50 and @entity51 , and as well as begonias , chrysanthemums and poinsettias , the company produces 1.5 million orchids a year			0
the @entity2 , with their upright stems and open flowers , are the most popular breed of orchid			1
a giant glasshouse full of orchids in flower is a truly dazzling sight ; wave after wave of white , pink , yellow , lime green and magenta , as far as the eye can see			0
these massed blooms have no scent , but that may change soon			0
' there 'll probably be a scented orchid on the market within ten years , ' predicts @entity76 's commercial manager , @entity75			1
' the holy grail is a true red - that 's probably five years away			2
' what about a blue orchid , i ask hopefully			0
' not within my lifetime , ' @entity75 says , adding with a grimace , ' those blue ones you see in shops are dyed			0
' the company sources its young orchids from a laboratory in @entity91			0
for the next year and a half the plants are grown on in the nursery : first in steamily hot temperatures where they get up to 20 hours of light ; then , to encourage them into bloom , in a cooler glasshouse			0
twenty - four hours after leaving the nursery , the orchids will be on sale in the shops			2
you can get orchids for under a tenner , but most of them sell for between £ 10 and £ 20			0
@entity2 are popular all year round , but for @entity110 sales go up five-fold			1
new and interesting orchids can sell for thousands of pounds at auction to commercial growers , and in the next few years we can expect to see lots of ' vintage - style ' varieties - flowers in dusky pinks , or speckled with brown , or with frilled edges			2
as @entity75 says , ' @entity2 need hardly any care and they 'll flower for up to three months , with new flowers opening every week			2
they 're amazing - they really are the perfect indoor plant			2

orchids are @entity9 's most popular house plant
surprisingly many orchids are grown in @entity9 - starting life in a test tube
the most popular breed is the @entity2 orchid
