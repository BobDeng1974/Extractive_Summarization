horseless carriage : the electric car , designed to look like a classic motor , is being offered as an alternative to horses in @entity3 ' the one yesterday was not the first one -- it was one in a long line of accidents , " @entity10 said			1
' and it 's for a very simple reason -- horses do n't belong on the streets of @entity7			0
