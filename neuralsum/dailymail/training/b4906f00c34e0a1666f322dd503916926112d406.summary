the devastating bushfires which swept across parts of @entity2 and @entity3 in recent weeks have left many native animals burnt , orphaned and homeless			1
after an appeal last week the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) were inundated with mittens for koalas who had their paws scorched in the fires , but now it 's the little joeys who need help			1
many joeys , some very young , have been left injured and without their mothers and so wildlife carers need pouches they can keep the native animals warm and safe in			1
she said kangaroos , wallabies , possums and many other species had also been severely affected by the out - of - control infernos and so @entity37 was launched			0
' vets and wildlife carers use very simple cotton pouches to keep these animals warms , ' ms @entity27 said			0
@entity37 asks supporters to sew simple cotton pouches so wildlife carers can carry the native animals in them ' the good thing about the pouches is that wildlife carers use these pouches all year around			1
' those caring for the injured or orphaned native animals can go through up to six pouches a day she added , and so it is important for there to be a stockpile of them			0
many of the joeys also had their feet and paws scorched in the blaze and so they 've been wrapped up in bandages to help their injuries heal			0
many kangaroos have been left with bad burns on their paws and legs leaving them in bandages to heal a vet tends to a kangaroo 's injuries sustained in the @entity26 fire , and the joey is expected to make a full recovery the pattern for people wishing to sew pouches is available on the @entity5 website , and there are five different sizes the organisation is appealing for			2
@entity5 has asked the members of the @entity84 public send the pouches to their @entity86 office , but despite receiving mittens from @entity88 , the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and many other parts of the world have suggested international donors sit this one out			2
anyone outside of @entity2 who still wishes to support these little joeys can donate on the organisation 's website , or support one of the local initiatives @entity5 is conducting closer to home			2
the cotton pouches are also used to care for other native wildlife such as possums and wombats			0
