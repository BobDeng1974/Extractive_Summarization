but she told the @entity22 she thought @entity15 's chances of succeeding their father are ' slim '			1
it may be that @entity1 is publicly distancing herself from her sister because @entity15 has been linked to a wide - ranging international fraud investigations			1
critics claim she runs a huge business empire in @entity17			0
@entity15 has denied all wrongdoing			2

she said : ' and i am confident they can not be solved by using force			0
' @entity11 is accused of sanctioning his henchmen to slaughter hundreds of his own citizens at a massacre in the city of @entity164 in 2005 , though western leaders have courted him due to his country 's proximity to @entity168			2

@entity201 : after 9/11 @entity112 president @entity202 met president @entity11 , viewing @entity17 as useful because it borders @entity168 curiously , despite @entity1 's claim that she and her sister have not spoken for 12 years , another leaked @entity112 cable suggests that only nine years ago the two partied together in the capital , @entity208 , where @entity1 reportedly owned a nightclub			1
