a @entity2 @entity1 ship was cutting ice on frozen - over @entity4 thursday morning when they came across a bizarre sight : a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures			1
when crew members brought the curious 25 - year - old man on board , he said he was trying to walk from @entity13 to @entity14			1
@entity13 lies on the southwestern shore of @entity4 , and the unidentified ice - walker was found just half a mile from @entity17 on the opposite shore			1
from there it 's a 201 - mile journey on land to reach the @entity23 capital			1
@entity13 is on the southwestern shore of @entity4 , and the unidentified man was found just a half - mile from an island on the opposite shore all alone : @entity1 say the man stood out since he was n't wearing the type of clothes used for snowmobiling or ice - fishing on the lake @entity2 coast guard petty officer second class @entity39 first spotted the @entity42 man walking on the lake around 9:30am on thursday			1
the sight was especially odd considering how the man was dressed : in regular pedestrian clothes - not the heavy gear used for snowmobiling or ice fishing			1
he also was n't carrying a flotation device , and @entity39 says he could have easily broken through the ice and drowned			2
' that raised flags right off the bat , ' @entity39 told @entity55			0
@entity39 and another @entity56 then put on gear to walk on the ice towards the man who , though able to stand and walk , was clearly suffering from hypothermia			2
' when we got to him , you could tell the cold was getting to him , ' said @entity39			0
' he was very lethargic ... he was shivering very bad			0
' he also would n't speak at first and had a ' 1,000 - yard stare '			0
when they got him back to the ship and started treating him for the cold , the man started talking and revealed his travel plans			0
it 's believed he had been walking for two to three days when the @entity1 found him			1
the @entity1 then brought the man back to port just after noon where he received further treatment			2
it was the first rescue by a @entity79 ice cutter boat in four years			0
the boats break up ice on the lakes to clear travel for commercial shipping			0
' most of us joined the @entity1 to protect life , ' lt. @entity85 , commanding officer of the @entity86 , said in a prepared statement			2
' our primary mission during the winter months is breaking ice to keep commercial traffic moving , but preserving life will always come first			0

the unidentified 25 - year - old man was spotted walking about a half mile from @entity23 's @entity17 on @entity4 thursday morning
the @entity1 rescued the man , who said he was trying to walk from @entity13 to @entity14 and was two to three days into the journey
