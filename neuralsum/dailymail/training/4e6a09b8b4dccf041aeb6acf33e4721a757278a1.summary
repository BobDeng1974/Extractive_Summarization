visitors looking to explore the dark side of @entity3 's northern industrial city of @entity5 board a striking blue bus , painted with the faces of local politicians alongside pigs and rats clutching bags of money			1
the bus stops at 10 city landmarks while a recording plays , detailing how public money has been allegedly misspent and siphoned off at these places - the government palace , state congress and other public buildings			1
this is the ' @entity22 ' , set up by the @entity3 anti-graft organisation @entity23 in one of @entity26 's most affluent cities to expose the abuse of power and misuse of public funds that is rife in @entity3 and goes largely unpunished			1
' the bus tour aims to fight indifference and wake people up and show them ... with clear examples the impact corruption has , ' said @entity49 , a @entity23 leader and @entity22 organiser			1
the tallest in @entity5 , that was constructed using public money ' when you ask people what their top concerns are , they 'll answer violence , unemployment and the state of the economy , instead of corruption			2
but we believe corruption is a national problem , the root cause of our problems and one that is linked to violence			0
' the free one - hour - long tour , which kicked off just weeks ago , is already a sellout , attracting mostly @entity3 living in and around @entity5 , as well as tourists and local media from across the country , he said			2
the tour stops at rows of box - like miniscule homes built for poor families without proper urban planning and services , which have since been abandoned			0
it also swings by the infamous @entity80 , where 52 people died in a 2011 arson attack that police blamed on drug traffickers			1
@entity49 described the casino as a ' monument to corruption ' , where people died because exit doors were not working			2
he called the subsequent investigation flawed			0
@entity3 ranks 106 out of 177 countries in @entity93 's 2013 index based on perceived levels of public corruption , with number one being the least corrupt			0
since taking power in 2012 , @entity3 's president @entity97 has sent a raft of legislation to combat graft to @entity102 , including a bill that would create an authority to investigate political corruption			0
@entity23 backs constitutional reforms that would allow independent candidates to run for office as a way to clean up traditional politics			0
the group hopes the tour will mobilise @entity3 to hold elected to account and take action against graft here you can see how the group have likened the politicians in @entity3 to animals , pillaging money ahead of midterm elections in 2015 - when @entity3 is due to vote in its lower house , nine state governors and hundreds of local mayors - the group also hopes to spur voter disenchantment with dishonest politicians			1
during the @entity22 , dirty local politicians are named and shamed , cited by their full names			2
' the punishment a citizen can give them in political terms is not to vote for them again , ' @entity49 said .			0
