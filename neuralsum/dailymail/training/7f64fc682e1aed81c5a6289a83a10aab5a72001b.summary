by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 14 june 2013 reputation : gangster @entity2 , who had a £ 50,000 reward on his head , claimed that he lost his eye in a fight , but police believe it was cut out @entity2 ’s false black onyx eye became a badge of pride and a mark of his hardman image on the streets of @entity15			1
he knew the false eye and the empty socket behind it – which had to be searched every time he came into court – looked menacing			1
criminal associates say he would use it to intimidate other drug dealers			0
but mystery surrounds how he lost his left eye			1
some say it was badly damaged by a knuckleduster in a drunken bar - room brawl while others say it was knocked out in a fight with gangsters in @entity34			1
but a police source said officers were suspicious of the stories because there is no marking or scar tissue around his eye socket			1
they suspect his eye may have been ‘ plucked out ’ by a knife - wielding crime rival			2
the source added : ‘ he thought it made him look like a baddie out of a @entity47 film			0
he was definitely looking for a dramatic image and this fulfilled it			1
’ @entity2 was subjected to twice - daily checks behind his false eye as part of the security operation surrounding his trial			1
during the trial , a source at @entity57 , better known as @entity57 , said : ‘ every time he comes in and every time he goes out of the building he must be searched and checked – including behind his eye			2
‘ because he is a category a prisoner , each time he leaves these walls he is strip - searched and he must take his eye out so we can look behind it for drugs or some sort of weapon or anything he should n’t have			2
‘ and every time he comes back from court he gets strip - searched again and he has to take his eye out again – and it p * * * * s him off			0
he said : ‘ it was military - style weaponry – grenades from a former war zone			0
the worry is that there are huge numbers of these weapons out there from other parts of the world and it is relatively easy for certain individuals to import them into this country			0
’ sources revealed that hand grenades , machine guns , bullets and even rockets were among a shocking array of firepower available on the black market			0
attack : @entity2 emptied the magazine of this @entity108 handgun and then dumped it by the bodies of the officers he had just fatally injured extraordinary : @entity83 discovered this stash of grenades inside a storm drain during @entity2 's 17 - week trial the ‘ shopping list ’ available to criminals means they can buy grenades for as little as £ 150 each , while semi-automatic handguns with bullets cost £ 250			2
military - issue assault rifles cost £ 500 to £ 1,000 while a magazine of bullets for the weapons costs anything from £ 5 to £ 50			0
grenades are the latest addition to the arsenal of criminals as they ramp up the ‘ terror quotient ’			0
@entity2 had an arsenal of @entity134 hand grenades and used four during his murderous spree which claimed the lives of four people last year			2
only last week police found a cache of ten grenades believed to be linked to @entity2 at an address in @entity15			1
police say the grenades used by @entity2 came from the former @entity143			1
the @entity134 is a fragmentation grenade which has 3,000 tiny steel balls packed into its shell which explode over a 50m radius			0
police sources say the @entity151 grenades are available on @entity153 ’s streets and are becoming a status symbol among criminals			0
tribute : @entity157 , father of pc @entity75 , reads a statement outside @entity159 after @entity2 was told he will die in prison deceit : police forensics at the scene of the officers 's death , where @entity2 fired 32 times , threw a hand grenade then sped off in a car bereft : police officers , who were almost all in tears , pause for thought after laying flowers near to the scene of the shooting paying their respects : colleagues of the fallen pcs came in huge numbers to say their goodbyes and leave messages and flowers property : windows were smashed and the wall scorched at this house in @entity187 , @entity15 , caused by a grenade thrown by @entity2 stash : this is the drain in @entity191 , @entity192 where a bag of explosives was hidden by @entity2 images : police took pictures of these walls where @entity2 's grenades pitted them with shrapnel and smashed nearby window throwing glass everywhere			1

one theory is left eyeball was crushed during @entity207 street brawl
but police say socket is not damaged , so probably *sliced* out
@entity2 *revelled* in the ' dramatic image ' his missing eye gave him
