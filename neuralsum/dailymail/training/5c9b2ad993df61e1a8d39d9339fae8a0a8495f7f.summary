a jobcentre adviser who smashed her car into a lamp - post after finishing a bottle of wine has been cleared of drink - driving after a judge accepted she had been sleepwalking			2
@entity7 , 28 , was arrested and failed a breath test after staggering from the wreck of her @entity10 in her pyjamas			1
it later emerged that minutes earlier she had driven to work – even though it was saturday night – where an incredulous security guard told her the office was shut for the weekend			0
relieved : @entity7 was cleared of the charges against her after it was proved that she had been fast asleep when she got in the car drunk now , after an extraordinary legal battle , miss @entity7 has been acquitted after a court found she had been asleep the whole time and therefore could n’t be held responsible for her actions			1
unbeknown to her , it turned out she had been suffering from sleepwalking episodes for years			0
her defence was backed by a leading sleep expert who has previously gone to court to debunk claims by murderers and rapists that they were asleep at the time of their crimes			1
on the day of the crash , miss @entity7 had awoken early , because she was worrying about an appointment she had concerning voluntary work			1
‘ i struggle to sleep anyway , and on the day of the crash i ’d been awake since 6am , ’ she said			2
‘ later on i had a friend round to my home and we both had a few glasses of wine and did karaoke together.then the next thing i knew i was getting out of my car after crashing into a lamp - post			0
’ witnesses described the psychology graduate as appearing ‘ confused ’ after the crash , which she escaped with only a graze to her hand , thanks to her car ’s airbags			0
breath tests found 96mg of alcohol per 100ml – nearly three times the legal limit of 35mg – and she told officers she had obviously been drink - driving			1
but after telling solicitor @entity61 she had no memory of getting into the car and ‘ it felt like committing a crime in my sleep ’ , he set about investigating further			1
in law , sleepwalking – or automatism – is a defence against committing a criminal act as there is no conscious act of will involved			0
shortly before the crash , at about 10pm on saturday , february 11 this year , miss @entity7 had arrived at the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , where she is a customer service adviser – a five - mile journey from her @entity81 home			1
the security guard – whose evidence was to prove crucial in the case – pointed out to the pyjama - clad miss @entity7 that she was n’t due in for another 36 hours , and she left again			1
miss @entity7 now believes that after falling asleep on the sofa , she had been disturbed by the noise of her housemates shutting the front door as they went out , and got into her car without waking up			1
an expert examining the case concluded she crashed because she was actually moving into a phase of deeper sleep			2
he said evidence that both @entity94 and – she has now learnt – other family members had previously sleepwalked supported the theory			0
trigger : it is believed the noise of her housemate shutting the door disturbed her sleep and make her get up and get in her car this week at @entity81 magistrates court , district judge @entity103 said she was ‘ satisfied that the defendant did drive while in a state of parasomnia ’ , or disordered sleep			2
yesterday miss @entity7 – originally from @entity109 – told the @entity110 : ‘ it really has n’t sunk in yet – it ’s been the worst year of my life and i ’m so relieved it ’s all over			1
‘ i would never in a million years drink and drive ; in fact i ’ve always been strongly against it			0
‘ i had no idea i might have been sleepwalking , but the more we pieced things together , the more it made sense			0
a few weeks later i was due to go to @entity120 , and i woke up at 3am and realised i ’d been putting my make - up on in my sleep			0
’ miss @entity7 – who could not get legal aid and had to fund her defence through a family inheritance – now gives a friend ‘ custody ’ of her car keys when she ’s asleep to prevent a repeat			2
@entity131 dr @entity130 said it was the first time in 26 years specialising in sleep disorders that he had gone to court to support an account of sleepwalking			2
‘ her experience is at the extreme end of parasomnia , but the evidence strongly showed that she had indeed been asleep right up until the crash , ’ he told the @entity110			0
mr @entity61 , of @entity143 solicitors , said he too had no doubt @entity94 had been asleep , saying : ‘ the message is not you can get away with drink - driving if you advance sleepwalking as a defence , but that the justice system does work in the event of genuine circumstances			0
