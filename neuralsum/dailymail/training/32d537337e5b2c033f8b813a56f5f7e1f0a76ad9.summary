scientists have developed breakthrough drugs that cure skin cancer			1
the treatment is already having ‘ spectacular ’ effects in seriously ill melanoma patients – and could soon be used to defeat other types of cancer			1
one scientist said it was ‘ amazing ’ that researchers could talk of ‘ using the c - word – cure ’ for the first time , while another said trials among kidney and lung cancer patients are ‘ very exciting ’			1
each year almost 13,000 people in @entity18 are diagnosed with melanoma , including two people aged 15 to 34 every day one in six patients ravaged by deadly skin cancer are already being cured by the drugs , the @entity21 was told yesterday , with the possibility of more than half being saved with an new combination			1
the astonishing development will save the lives of thousands of patients with advanced melanoma , who usually die within months of being diagnosed			1
the new treatment , which will bring hope to hundreds of thousands of people in @entity18 with terminal conditions , involves the combination of two different types of drug that ‘ reboot ’ the immune system			1
the first is ipilimumab – or ‘ ipi ’			0
according to research presented to the @entity47 congress in @entity48 yesterday , 17 per cent of patients are cured by this drug alone			1
but many more – perhaps more than half – could be ‘ clinically cured ’ by combining them with even newer drugs called anti-pd1s which break down cancer cells ’ defences			1
professor @entity56 of the @entity57 in @entity58 said : ‘ [ @entity59 ] melanoma could become a curable disease for perhaps more than 50 per cent of patients within five to 10 years			1
’ he told @entity62 : ‘ if i ’d made this bizarre prediction five years ago , people would have said i was mad			1
but it now looks like we are going to have control of advanced melanoma for years , in a substantial proportion of patients			2
’ each year almost 13,000 people in @entity18 are diagnosed with melanoma , including two people aged 15 to 34 every day			1
it kills 2,200 a year , accounting for four in five skin cancer deaths			1
the number of cases has quadrupled in 30 years , due in part to our fondness for foreign holidays to sunny destinations			0
if caught early enough , malignant moles can be cut out before the cancer spreads , but if it is missed and the cancer turns ‘ metastatic ’ – spreading to other organs – chances of long term survival plummet			2
at that stage patients are usually told they have just months to live			0
currently , less than a quarter survive a year or more			2
prof @entity56 believed these new immunotherapy drugs would be adopted ‘ across the board ’ to successfully treat a wide range of other advanced ‘ solid tumour ’ cancers			2
he said : ‘ these drugs are going to help a large number of people			1
it ’s a massive deal			0
reports from trials with patients who have advanced kidney and lung cancer are very exciting			2
’ in one lung cancer trial using @entity106 drugs , tumours markedly shrank in a quarter of very ill patients who had failed to respond to chemotherapy , he said			1
trials had also been started in patients with prostate , bowel and breast cancer			2
prof @entity114 , of the @entity115 in @entity116 , found encouraging results in the survival chances of almost 5,000 melanoma patients put on ipi			2
‘ this is a really amazing time , ’ he said			0
‘ a few years ago we could never have imagined using the c - word – cure – in melanoma			2
but we are headed that way			0
’ cancer scientists have tried for decades to create drugs which help the immune system fight cancer , but until very recently immunotherapy appeared to be a dead - end			1
prof @entity56 said 24 of his 27 years in the field had been ‘ very difficult			0
i could n’t see the light at the end of the tunnel			0
’ most attempts had failed because they had concentrated on the wrong thing : activating cancer - fighting t - cells , rather than breaking down the tumours ’ defences			2
he said : ‘ all these attempts ended when they came up against the wall of defence			0
we needed to break down that wall and open up the tumour to attack , which ipi and the @entity148 do in different ways			0
now it ’s a totally different ball game			0
’ @entity18 experts yesterday said there was ‘ enormous excitement ’ at the new drugs – although they stressed it was still early days			1
professor @entity155 , chief clinician at @entity156 , said : ‘ we have always thought that if you can get the immune system to respond to a tumour , then it ’s likely to be a long - lasting effect , because the immune system is designed to last for life			1
so it ’s very exciting that we are starting to see it working			0
’ dr @entity166 , of the @entity167 in @entity168 , said ipi alone was ‘ a vast improvement ’ on previous treatment			2
‘ traditionally , when melanoma has spread to other organs , it is regarded as incurable			0
so this is big news			0
‘ it ’s difficult to know that we have actually ‘ cured ’ people , because we have to wait to see if they die from something else			1
but all this new ipi data points to the fact that if you respond to the drug and are still alive three years after treatment , then it ’s very likely that you are clinically cured			1
it ’s a very big story			0
’ the breakthrough comes after @entity186 announced the extension of a £ 200 million - a - year budget to pay for cancer treatments denied to @entity191 patients because rationing body @entity192 believes they are poor value for money			1
@entity197 is already available on the @entity191 , under the brand name @entity199 , although its course of four treatments is very expensive			0
dr @entity166 is now working on a trial to combine ipi with @entity205 and said early results have shown ‘ spectacular levels of tumour shrinkage ’			0
initial trial results presented earlier this year showed that tumours shrank by more than half in 11 per cent of patients put on ipi , in 41 per cent put on @entity214 – but in 53 per cent of those given both			0
professor @entity217 of the @entity218 described the immune - boosters as ‘ a real breakthrough ’ , adding : ‘ i think we will have the expertise to take more patients to five , ten years [ of life ] and eventually cure them			0
’ @entity225 of the @entity226 said : ‘ it is really encouraging to see positive data			0
we hope that this is just the beginning			0

new treatment combine two different drugs that ' reboot ' immune system
one in six ravaged by skin cancer are already being cured by the drugs
each year almost 13,000 people in @entity18 are diagnosed with melanoma
