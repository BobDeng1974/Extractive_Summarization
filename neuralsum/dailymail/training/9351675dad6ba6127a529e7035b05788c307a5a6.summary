by @entity0 @entity2 staff complained after a religious guru who follows a highly controversial @entity5 mystic gave them a talk about meditation			1
@entity8 was invited to the @entity11 's @entity10 headquarters @entity12 last wednesday to give a talk on ' mindfulness in an era of the 24 - hour news cycle '			1
mr @entity8 is a swami for a religious order called @entity19 , based on the teachings of @entity19 - a mystic with divisive views on @entity23 and homosexuality , and two of whose followers carried out an infamous bioterrorist attack in 1984			1
@entity8 was invited to the @entity11 's @entity10 headquarters @entity12 last wednesday to give a talk on ' mindfulness in an era of the 24 - hour news cycle ' photos from the talk on the swami 's facebook page show him in a room full of staff with their eyes closed and wearing a @entity2 identity card			1
@entity41 works from an @entity19 meditation camp in the forests of @entity44 , whose website states : ' @entity46 is a true devout and lover of @entity19			1
' his undying love for the master , his simplicity in life and his compassion for everyone are his true gifts that have given birth to beautiful @entity57 around the world			0
' the website adds that he met @entity19 , who also went by the name @entity62 , in 1969 and ‘ took initiation ’ from him in 1974 before being ‘ instructed ’ to return to @entity44 to ‘ pioneer the @entity62 movement ’			1
@entity65 , a senior producer on @entity67 ’s @entity66 , complained in a letter to the @entity2 's in - house magazine @entity69 , which is published online			1
he wrote : ' i ’m a bit concerned that something called the @entity2 @entity73 has invited a man who claims to have been inspired by @entity19 , aka @entity75 , to give a " discourse " to @entity2 staff			1
' @entity75 was a discredited " godman " hounded out of several countries , who ran ashrams best known for attempted murder , sexual licentiousness and amassing vast quantities of money ( and scores of @entity87 cars )			0
' as i said in my email to the organisers : what next for the faith forum - a devoted follower of @entity92 ? mr @entity8 is a swami for a religious order called @entity19 , based on the teachings of @entity19 - a mystic with divisive views on @entity23 and homosexuality , and two of whose followers carried out an infamous bioterrorist attack in 1984 photos from the talk on the swami 's facebook page show him addressing a room full of staff wearing a @entity2 identity card ' as an organisation populated by a large number of journalists and ( hopefully ) critical thinking intellectuals , i ’m not sure we should be promoting people who legitimise cults and criminals			1
' another @entity2 worker , who asked not to be named , said : ' how they let this guy in is incredible - if he believes the teachings of @entity19 then he ’s not someone the @entity2 should be inviting to talk to our staff			1
' two followers of @entity19 , who died in 1990 , were convicted of carrying out an infamous bioterrorist attack using salmonella in 1984			2
some 751 people were given food poisoning in the attack in @entity128 , where @entity19 's followers had begun a new commune and wanted control of the area			2
@entity19 was never himself convicted of any offence over the attack			2
in a 1985 talk quoted in a book of his speeches , from death to @entity136 , @entity19 claimed the @entity140 was more peaceful than the way in which @entity5 died under colonial rule			1
' @entity144 ’s violence with the @entity23 was far more peaceful , because he killed people in the most up - to - date gas chambers , where you do n’t take much time , ' he said			0
' thousands of people can be put in a gas chamber , and just a switch is pressed			0
within a second you will not know when you were alive and when you died			0
within a second , you evaporate			0
' the chimneys of the factory start taking you , the smoke – you can call it the holy smoke – and this seems to be a direct way towards @entity161			0
the smoke simply goes upwards			0
' in another lecture in the same collection , he claimed a previous @entity166 had been gay and said : ' if the pope is homosexual – and popes are infallible – it creates great suspicion , because @entity170 was also hanging out with twelve boys			1
it may be something coming down from @entity170 himself			2
' the chair of the @entity2 's @entity73 , @entity176 , said the aim of the @entity73 was to ' promote greater understanding ' among @entity2 staff and would never lend its support to @entity19 and he said : ' @entity181 is a religious disease			1
it started in the monasteries where monks were put together and no woman was allowed			0
it is the ultimate result of homosexuality , it is a by - product of homosexuality			0
' the chair of the @entity2 ’s @entity73 , @entity176 , said the aim of the @entity73 was to ‘ promote greater understanding ’ among @entity2 staff and would never lend its support to @entity19			1
in a reply to @entity69 today , she wrote : ' the @entity2 @entity73 is a forum governed by its own constitution and supported by @entity192			0
' the main objective of the forum is to promote a greater understanding and awareness to @entity2 staff , in general , of the faiths and related faith groups that make up the audience and source of @entity2 output and in order to do this we have begun to organise various events to be held from time to time			2
' for the first of these events , the @entity2 @entity73 decided to invite @entity46 , a meditation guru from @entity44			0
' his presentation was well received by the 50 strong audience which was testimony to the interest it generated			0
' she added : ' the @entity2 @entity73 has no position regarding @entity19 or any other religious or spiritual gurus and we would like to clarify that the @entity73 will not be used in any way to promote any cult , sect or groups so as to hurt deep personal sentiments of @entity2 staff			2
' we welcome suggestions and constructive comments from all @entity2 colleagues			0
' the @entity2 said that events organised by the @entity227 were entirely independent			0
a @entity2 spokesperson said : ' @entity229 is one of a number of independently - run staff forums which organise their own events and choose the speakers invited to participate			2

@entity8 gave a talk on ' mindfulness in an era of the 24 - hour news cycle '
around 50 staff attended talk in @entity2 's @entity243
but on @entity8 's website he says he is a ' true devout and lover of @entity19 '
@entity19 , known as @entity62 , was a divisive @entity5 mystic
he said @entity140 victims died more peacefully than @entity5 in colonial rule
@entity170 may have been gay as he was ' hanging out with 12 boys , ' he said
