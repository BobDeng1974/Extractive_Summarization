by @entity0 published : 23:44 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 29 april 2013 a massive search was going on last night after a @entity3 sailor fell from his yacht in the @entity5 , leaving his terrified fiancée on board alone			1
the woman , also from the @entity3 , had little sailing experience and was unable to keep track of the man as he was carried out of sight in the shark - infested waters			1
she was later plucked to safety by a @entity17 helicopter after calling rescue services in @entity3			1
remote : a woman was recovered from the boat in the middle of the @entity5 , the @entity22 said , but the captain is still missing resources : the @entity17 diverted the @entity25 , an amphibious assault ship that was headed homeward , to assist in the search for the captain her 35 - year - old partner had still not been found yesterday , more than two days after falling overboard 500 miles from land			1
he was reportedly conscious and wearing a life jacket when he fell overboard			1
she used the satellite phone on the 38ft yacht to call the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37			0
officials immediately contacted the @entity22 in @entity39 to launch a rescue operation			1
the couple , who have not been named , were sailing towards @entity39 when they hit trouble 2,000 miles short of their destination			1
they were about 500 miles west of the @entity46 , a volcanic island best known as the scene of the @entity48 in the @entity49			2
the area was too remote to be reached quickly by boat and winds were reported at 25mph with 6ft swells			2
@entity22 spokesman @entity54 said four @entity17 helicopters were combing the region around the clock , along with two @entity59 planes and a @entity17 warship which had been diverted to help			1
air and sea : the @entity22 sent an @entity59 airplane from an @entity65 air station to the remote part of the @entity5 he said : ‘ i do n’t know what made the sailor fall overboard			1
the female with him said he was conscious at the time and he was wearing a yellow life jacket			2
‘ it ’s real challenging out there			0
we ca n’t get our cutters out there			0
’ the man fell overboard at about 11.30pm on saturday			1

‘ we are aware of reports of a @entity86 missing in the @entity5			0
we stand ready to provide consular assistance , ’ a spokesman said			0
mr @entity54 said the rescue crews were using a computer programme that checks wind and currents from the area the @entity3 sailor went missing , to estimate the direction and distance he was swept away from the boat			2
he acknowledged there were sharks in the area , but said there was still hope of finding the man alive			0
‘ the water is warmer there than in some other areas we cover and the techniques we are using have been previously effective , ’ he said			0
the man had a light beacon on his life jacket , making it more likely he could be spotted .			0
