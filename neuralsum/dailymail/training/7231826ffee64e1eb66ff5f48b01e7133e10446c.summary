by @entity0 published : 13:41 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 13:42 est , 20 march 2013 a church - going 83 - year - old widow has been handed a suspended jail sentence for ' waging psychological warfare ' on her soldier neighbour and his young family after a football landed in her garden			1
in a shocking campaign of harassment , ' vile ' pensioner @entity9 – known as @entity10 on her middle - class estate because of her smart dress and aloofness – ' visited mental torture ' on the sergeant major , his wife , and their two sons after they moved in next door			1
@entity9 branded them ' scum ' and ' hooligans ' , deprived the youngsters of sleep by repeatedly banging on the walls , and made up foul - mouthed songs about the family			1
' @entity31 ' : 83 year - old @entity9 leaves @entity32 today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail the great - grandmother , a member of the @entity37 's women 's section for 66 years before she was kicked out for the offences , even set off her own burglar alarm to disturb the peace			1
she also taunted the young mother about the loss of a six - month - old baby and said she hoped her husband ' would n't come back from @entity45 ' following a tour of duty			0
in a bid to stop the abuse , @entity9 was given a five - year restraining order in july last year preventing her from contacting the family , who can not be named for legal reasons , or any visitors to their home in @entity55 , @entity56			1
she was handed the ban , and a fine , after admitting a charge of harassment at @entity61 , and was told she had only just escaped jail because of her age			0
but incredibly , @entity9 ignored the warning , and was arrested again within 24 hours of her court appearance for resuming her reign of terror on the quiet residential street			2
harassment : @entity9 , 83 , launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child 's football landed in her garden @entity9 pleaded not guilty to breaching the restraining order on four separate occasions - even claiming that she was singing hymns instead of being abusive			1
but jps at the same court rejected her denials and convicted her of the offences last december			0
chairman of the bench @entity83 adjourned sentence so psychiatric reports into @entity86 's mental state could be prepared			0
@entity87 , defending , said medical reports showed @entity9 was suffering from the early stages of dementia and alzheimer 's disease , and claimed this explained much of her erratic behaviour			1
but mr @entity83 said it was clear @entity9 ' retained the capacity to know right from wrong '			2
he added : ' your actions had a significant impact on the children living next door to you			0
the family were victimised by you to such an extent they had to leave home			0
' mr @entity83 told @entity9 that if the family had remained at home , she would have been sent to prison because it would have been the court 's duty to protect them from further harm			1
instead , she was given a 26 - week jail term , suspended for two years , and ordered to pay the family £ 2,000 in compensation , as well as prosecution costs of £ 620			0
she was also reminded by magistrates that the existing five - year restraining order remained in place			1
at an earlier hearing , the court heard the family , who now live in @entity122 where the @entity123 is based , moved in next to @entity9 in 2011 wanting to make a ' fresh start ' after the loss of their baby , and initially got on well with their new neighbour			2
the mother even confided in @entity9 , who lives alone , about the death of the child - but the relationship turned sour after a ball the children were playing with landed in @entity9 ' garden			1
@entity136 , prosecuting , said the trouble then escalated rapidly , with @entity9 setting off her own burglar alarm to prevent the children from sleeping			2
abusive : the pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house , as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action the hearing was told @entity9 , who had lived in her semi-detached home since 1991 , would regularly insult the mother with songs she had made up			1
mrs @entity136 added : ' she would repeat over and over things like " you are poison , you are evil , you wo n't win , go back to where you came from , you are nothing but a tramp "			0
' mrs @entity136 said that on occasions , the taunts referred to the dead child			0
she said : ' @entity9 would shout words similar to , " what kind of life would the child have had if it lived ? " ' the family were asked by police to log every incident to build up a dossier of evidence against @entity9			2
pictures the family took included the widow , who lives alone , flashing a v sign as she passed their home			0
she was eventually arrested and appeared in court on july 25 last year , where she admitted harassment and was given the restraining order			1
however , just a day later @entity9 committed her first breach			1
@entity9 went on to commit three further breaches of the restraining order in early september			1
she made retching noises at the family , called the mother ' scum ' , and insulted the children			2
after @entity9 was found guilty of the breaches , victim impact statements from the family were read out			2
one female magistrate wept as the court heard how @entity9 ' behaviour had left the mother ' depressed , exhausted , and on the verge of a breakdown '			0
in her statement , she said @entity9 had waged ' psychological warfare against her and her family ' , adding she was ' barely able to function without the support of her wider family '			0
in a new statement read before @entity9 was sentenced , her husband asked the court what steps would be taken to protect his family from her when they return to the @entity203 in two years ' time			0
he added it would be very difficult to sell their home , as he would feel ' honour bound ' to tell potential buyers about @entity9 .			0

pensioner @entity9 branded neighbours ' scum ' and ' hooligans '
it all started when couple 's children kicked a football into her garden
the 83 - year - old repeatedly swore at the house as she passed
she was handed a restraining order last year only to breach it a day later
