grandmother @entity1 was inconsolable when her beloved at @entity3 went missing in august 2002			1
she searched high and low for him , but simply could not find him anywhere but more than ten years later mrs @entity1 , 56 , has finally welcomed her beloved pet back into her home in @entity11 , near @entity12 , @entity13 a member of the public found him and took him to a vet where he was identified thanks to his microchip			1
and although nobody knows where @entity3 has spent the last decade - it seems he may not have gone too far - as he was discovered just six miles from his owner 's home			1
mother - of - one @entity29 , who had moved to a new house shortly before @entity3 vanished , said : ' seeing him again was an absolutely fantastic feeling			1
i am walking around with a permanent grin on my face			0
' i look at him even now and just ca n't believe that i have got him back - it still feels quite surreal really			2
' it is so amazing			0
what 's happened to me , let 's face it , it 's a miracle			0
' it would be nice to know where he has been all this time - if only cats could talk			2
' @entity47 who works as @entity12 's insurance officer , scoured the area around her home for @entity3 when he disappeared , putting up missing cat posters and pushing similar leaflets through letterboxes of 200 homes			1
she said : ' i was devastated when he went missing - i cried my eyes out and everything			1
it was horrible - it felt like i had lost a child			2
' after 18 months i thought that the chance of ever getting him back was slim but i never stopped thinking of him			0
' i used to do a lot of running in the local area and i used to wonder then if i would ever see him			0
' you just do n't know do you ? cats can travel for miles			2
' she said she was stunned to pick up an answer phone message earlier this month from a veterinary practice in @entity70 - six miles from her home - telling her a woman had found @entity3 and brought him in			1
she said : ' when i heard the message i could n't believe it			0
' as soon as i saw him i knew it was him and so did my son @entity77			0
he went straight up to my son and nuzzled his head onto his arm			0
although it is not known where intrepid @entity3 - now 17 - has spent the last decade , he was discovered just six miles away from his home thanks to his electronic microchip ' i could n't believe it , i was just bouncing up and down			1
i even texted my ex-husband and said " you are not going to believe this , i have got @entity3 back "			1
' she said @entity3 's coat was in fantastic condition and she was sure somebody had been looking after him			1
she said : ' he is underweight at the moment and he was very weak on his back legs when i got him home - he could barely walk around the house			2
' the first time he tried to get up the stairs he really had to drag his back legs but now he is eating he is a changed cat			0
' he is jumping up on the bed and he is obviously feeling a lot better in himself			0
' i can tell that his sight is going , plus he 's got renal failure , although that 's now under control with tablets			0
' my first @entity5 , @entity108 , only made it to 11 because he had renal failure quite early on , so in many ways i am surprised to see him alive			0
' he always was a loving cat and that has n't changed despite him being away for ten years			1
' student veterinary nurse @entity114 , 22 , was on duty at @entity117 and @entity118 veterinary practice in @entity70 when a member of the public bought @entity3 in			2
she said : ' we have had cats that have gone missing for a few days or months and one that had gone for a year but we 've never had anything as long as this before			0
' @entity126 , the @entity127 's chief inspector for @entity13 , said : ' this just goes to show just how important microchips are as one of the only ways of permanently identifying a pet			0

@entity1 looked everywhere for her beloved cat @entity3 when he went missing in august 2002
ten years later she had resigned herself to the fact she would never see him again when he was found - just six miles away
