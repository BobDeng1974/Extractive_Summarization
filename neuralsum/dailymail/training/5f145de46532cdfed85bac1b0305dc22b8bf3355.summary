by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:00 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 16:31 est , 10 october 2012 @entity2 today prepared to hand over powers which will give 16 - year - olds the vote in the @entity6 independence referendum			1
however , despite the concession to the @entity8 , he vowed to fight to preserve the @entity9 ‘ with everything we ’ve got ’			1
at a meeting on monday the prime minister will agree to @entity6 first minister @entity15 ’s demands that 16 and 17 - year - old @entity6 should be given a vote on independence			1
future : @entity2 ( left ) will meet @entity6 first minister @entity15 ( right ) in @entity18 on monday to finalise arrangements for the historic referendum on @entity6 independence this will be viewed as a victory for the @entity24 , which says a higher proportion of younger voters back its aims			1
however , this claim was thrown into doubt by a poll for the @entity31 which showed that only 26 per cent of youngsters supported independence , with 59 per cent opposed			0
the @entity8 have lost the fight to have a second , fall - back question which would give them more powers even if they fail to get support for independence			2
instead , @entity6 voters will face a simple question asking whether they want their country to become independent			1
in his speech to the @entity42 conference , mr @entity2 asked : ‘ what could matter more than saving our @entity9 ? ’ mr @entity2 told activists in @entity46 that the @entity47 had highlighted the depth of feeling for the @entity9			1
‘ whether our athletes were @entity51 , @entity6 , @entity52 or from @entity53 , they draped themselves in one flag			1
‘ now , there ’s one person who did n’t like that and he ’s called @entity15			1
i ’m going to see him on monday to sort out that referendum on independence by the end of 2014			2
’ decision : under - 18s are close to securing a vote in the historic referendum on the @entity9 's constitution in 2014 he added : ‘ let ’s say it : we ’re better together and we ’ll rise together – and let us fight that referendum with everything we ’ve got			1
’ as part of the deal with the @entity8 , the @entity73 will hold the power over how the referendum is run and who gets a say in it			1
a @entity82 source said : ‘ it is usually for the administration which is running the vote to decide on the franchise			2
we can not stop them from extending voting rights but the @entity6 government will have to explain how it will ensure all 16 and 17 - year - olds get on the electoral roll in time			2
‘ this is definitely not setting a precedent for general or other elections , this is very specific to the independence referendum			2
’ polls have shown that most young people oppose the break - up of @entity9			1
government sources said this was because they were ‘ more internationalist ’			2
' personal issue ' : education secretary @entity103 , who is @entity6 , said lots of @entity9 ministers will be taking part in the campaign mr @entity15 said : ‘ i ’m certainly hoping and optimistic that a deal can be done next week			1
there are a number of issues that are still to be resolved			0
’ education secretary @entity103 , who is @entity6 , said : ‘ there will be lots of @entity9 ministers taking part in the campaign			1
for myself , because my family live in @entity6 , i do n’t want to be in a situation where i ’m part of a government that sees that my mum and dad become foreigners			0
for me , it ’s an emotional and personal issue			0
’ the elderly could have to wait years before the introduction of a system to prevent them having to sell their homes to pay for care , @entity124 admitted			0
currently at least 20,000 pensioners are forced to sell their home every year – denying their children an inheritance			0
older people were promised two years ago that a new system would be in place by 2015			0
however , the health secretary ’s comments appear to contradict mr @entity2 ’s pledge in the summer to find the money to cap the lifetime costs of long - term care for the elderly at £ 35,000			0
at a fringe event at the @entity42 conference , mr @entity124 said , although he wanted to impose a cap , it may have to be set at a higher level to make it more affordable			0
money could also be saved by restricting pensioners ’ eligibility for assistance , he said			0
last year , economist @entity155 recommended a cap on total lifetime costs , with the government stepping in to pay the rest			0
the economist put the cost of this at £ 1.7billion a year			0
the health secretary said : ‘ it may be that the right solution takes us a period of years to get to			0
this is something that is potentially very expensive			0

under - 18s are close to securing a vote in the historic referendum on the @entity9 ’s constitution in 2014
the deal was struck in *exchange* for @entity6 first minister @entity15 agreeing to a single , ‘ in or out ’ question on the ballot paper
polls show that two thirds of @entity6 want to remain @entity9
