asked to appraise the influence @entity2 has had on his career , @entity0 finds it difficult to express sufficient gratitude			1
from being handed a @entity7 debut at @entity8 aged just 18 to the later chance of @entity11 football with @entity12 , @entity2 has provided so much impetus for the @entity15 midfielder			1
that genuinely - felt debt will not , however , prevent @entity0 from trying to give his former manager a very unhappy return to @entity19 next month			1
@entity0 celebrates his equaliser for @entity15 against @entity21 in @entity22 on tuesday night @entity2 ’s @entity24 side will travel to @entity25 in buoyant mood after securing a last - gasp 1 - 1 draw with world champions @entity29 on tuesday night			1
this next encounter now promises to be a vital staging post for the @entity33 hopes of both nations , with @entity0 eagerly anticipating his reunion with @entity2			1
the @entity37 man continued his fine form for @entity15 by netting the opening goal for @entity41 ’s side in their 2 - 2 draw with @entity21 in @entity22			1
like @entity2 , @entity41 has been hugely significant in @entity0 ’s career , drawing arguably his most consistent form during their time together at @entity7			1
‘ i think i just understand what a good manager @entity2 is , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it is no surprise to me that he has got @entity52 playing the way they are			0
he is a superb man - manager , he really is			0
‘ listen , a lot better players than me have spoken highly of @entity2 so that underlines what he is about			1
‘ i think i am indebted to him for giving me an opportunity in the professional game , when he really did n’t have to			0
particularly at that stage in my career			0
i was only 18 and was n’t really a regular in the reserve side at @entity7 or anything like that			1
@entity0 ( left ) battles for possession of the ball with @entity21 's @entity72 during the @entity74 qualifier ‘ to be honest , it ’s probably similar to the view i have of the @entity15 manager just now			1
i do n’t think i can put into words how thankful i am			0
but , obviously , i am hopeful that @entity2 does n’t have a positive result next month			2
‘ that is the game			0
he will be trying to win and his assistant manager @entity81 was a superb player who i was fortunate enough to play 12 or 13 games alongside at @entity7			2
they will be trying to win every bit as much as we will			0
‘ it is a really mouth - watering game coming up but you could also say the same about the matches against @entity90 and @entity21 that we have just had			1
‘ every player has tough times in their career , whether it is long - term injuries or whatever			0
but nights like these – and hopefully more to come – make everything worthwhile			0
’ @entity101 ’s decommissioning from use in the @entity103 has taken @entity15 on the road at the end of 2014			2
having seen off the @entity106 at @entity8 , @entity0 has his sights on maintaining a 100 per cent home record in @entity25 ’s east end			2
‘ playing @entity24 at @entity19 is going to be an amazing occasion for everyone involved , ’ he admitted			1
@entity24 head coach @entity2 gives instructions during his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity29 ‘ the atmosphere in the stadium in @entity22 was fantastic , too			1
when they got their equaliser , the place was really rocking for the last 10 minutes			0
‘ i ’m looking forward to a similar atmosphere for the team at @entity19			2
‘ i ’m not sure if @entity24 ’s result against @entity29 changes anything in my eyes			2
i always knew they were a good side			0
‘ what it probably does is strengthen the idea of just how important this next match will be			0
‘ at the @entity90 game , i spoke about how i believe the home games will be really important			0
but then after the way we played in @entity21 , i now think we can get more points away from home than maybe i first thought			1
’ @entity0 placed a low shot into the net for a first - half equaliser against the @entity141			1
it was a goal of superb construction , with @entity144 and @entity145 both heavily involved			0
‘ the only thing i remember about it was @entity148 ’s cutback but i think that was the kind of goal we have been trying to aim for in the team , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ we had some similar moves against @entity90 without managing to finish them so it was good to get a team goal like that at an important moment in the match			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) is challenged by @entity160 's @entity159 in 2003 during his time at @entity7 @entity0 is not the only @entity15 player with experience of playing under @entity2			1
goalkeeper @entity164 famously performed heroics for @entity7 when pitched into action against @entity167 as a 19 - year - old			1
a decade on , he now hopes to throw up the shutters once again to frustrate his old boss			0
‘ it ’s going to be a huge game , ’ admitted @entity164			0
‘ we were expected to beat @entity90 but it was a hard game			0
now this @entity24 match will be a big one in terms of the group			2
‘ @entity24 got a late point against @entity29 but there ’s nothing we can do about that			1
we can only control our own destiny			0
‘ we ’ve been happy with the performances but we are a bit disappointed in the points return			0
hopefully we can now get back to @entity15 and have a couple of home games where we can get maximum points			2
‘ i ’m sure both @entity41 and @entity2 are looking forward to this next game			2
‘ it will get everyone excited , with both of them going back to @entity19			0
i ’m sure it will be a great atmosphere and i just hope it turns out all right for us			0
‘ @entity24 have had a good start and @entity21 have had a great result against @entity29 , so it makes the home games that much more important for us			1
