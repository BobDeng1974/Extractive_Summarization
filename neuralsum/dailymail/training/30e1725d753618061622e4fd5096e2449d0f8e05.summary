the evidence for ' @entity1 ' - the mysterious hypothesised planet on the edge of our solar system - has taken a new turn thanks to the mathematics of a noted astronomer			1
@entity9 , an astronomer at the @entity10 of @entity11 in @entity12 , says the irregular orbits of small icy bodies beyond @entity15 imply that a planet four times the size of @entity18 is swirling around our sun in the fringes of the solar system			1
@entity1 - perhaps mis - named now that @entity23 has been demoted to a dwarf planet - has been widely hypothesised for decade , but has never been proven			1
@entity9 measured the orbits of 92 @entity26 - small bodies and dwarf planets - and said that six objects appeared to be tugged off - course compared to their expected orbits			2
the hypothetical planet - four times the size of @entity18 - will float beyond @entity15 and @entity23 and cause disturbances in the @entity26 of asteroids he told astronomers at the @entity37 on tuesday that the most likely reason for the irregular orbits was a ' planetary - mass solar companion ' - a distant body of planet size that is powerful enough to move the kuiper belt objects			1
he suggested the planet would be four times bigger than @entity18 - around the size of @entity46 and would be 140 billion miles from the sun , or about 1,500 times further than the @entity18			2
alternatively an object the size of @entity50 on an irregular orbit that bought it to within five billion miles of the sun - close to @entity15 's orbit - could be the solution			0
however , due to the distances involved , it will be tough to for @entity59 astronomers to catch a glimpse of the hypothetical newest member of our solar system			0
even non-planet @entity23 is hard to spot thanks to the distances involved			1
the @entity26 belt lies on the outskirts of our solar system , and calculations imply a planet also lurks out there the solar system as we know it , showing ( l - r ) , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity18 , @entity50 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity15 while other astronomers are on the astronomical fence , they have applauded his methods			2
@entity82 , from the @entity83 told @entity84 that @entity9 ' has laid out a way to determine how such a planet could sculpt parts of our solar system			2
' so while , yes , the evidence does n't exist yet , i thought the bigger point was that he showed us that there are ways to find that evidence			0
' i do n't think he really has any evidence that suggests it is out there			0
' @entity98 , from the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , said : ' it seems surprising to me that a [ solar ] companion as small as @entity15 could have the effect he sees			0
' [ but ] i know @entity9 , and i 'm sure he did the calculations right			0
' the previous ninth planet , @entity23 , is one of the largest of the @entity26 dwarf planets , at some 1,400 miles wide			1
it got downgraded by the @entity110 in 2006 for failing to meet all the criteria of a ' planet ' , namely that its mass is not sufficient enough to clear its orbit of surrounding objects .			0

*distortion* to orbits of asteroids beyond @entity23 imply mystery planet is tugging at them , claims astronomer
