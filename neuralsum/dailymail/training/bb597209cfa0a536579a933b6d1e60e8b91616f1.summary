by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:49 am on 4th october 2011 @entity2 made sure to draw attention last week to its lack of fees for using debit cards after news broke that its biggest competitor would start charging them			1
but at the same time , the bank was letting its customers know they 'll soon have to meet stricter requirements to avoid monthly checking account charges			0
the main changes will be seen by customers with mid-tier checking accounts , which offer the potential for earning interest and a few other perks			1
starting in december , @entity20 will charge $ 20 a month on these accounts , unless the customer has combined balances of $ 15,000 or more in checking , savings and investment accounts or loan balances			1
new fees : starting in december , @entity20 will charge $ 20 a month on mid-tier checking accounts the fee was previously waived for combined balances of $ 6,000 for that level of account , which offers perks such as interest - bearing checking			1
customers also pay $ 2 fees for using @entity38 if they do n't meet the balance requirement			2
for @entity20 customers who used a product called ' @entity43 , ' which is being phased out , the change is more dramatic			2
for the past year @entity43 accountholders were able to avoid fees if they had combined balances of $ 1,500			1
if they did n't have that much , the fee was $ 7.50 or $ 9.50 a month , depending on their state			0
before that , those customers were able to avoid fees with a combination of direct deposit and online bill paying			0
customers who ca n't meet the requirements may find it necessary to switch to @entity20 's basic checking account			1
the bank last month raised the monthly fee on that account to $ 10 from $ 8 , unless customers maintain $ 1,500 in combined balances , or use both direct deposit and online bill payment at least once per month			1
customers have two months to decide how to respond to the changes			0
the fees will start being charged in december and will appear on january statements			0
in some cases , avoiding fees may be as simple as linking accounts together			0
way out : customers can avoid the fees by having combined balances of $ 15,000 or more in checking , savings and investment accounts or loan balances that 's because the combined balance requirement includes not just deposit accounts , such as savings , certificates of deposit and @entity84 , but also credit cards and loans - where the amount owed is counted as the balance			1
' if you just have your mortgage with @entity2 you 're pretty much there , ' said @entity92 , @entity20 's head of @entity95 consumer banking products			0
that reflects a broader effort in the banking industry to try to get more customers to open multiple accounts at one bank			0
@entity20 's move comes a few days after @entity103 said it will be charging $ 5 per month for using debit cards starting next year			1
other banks have also been testing such fees			0
@entity20 is highlighting the fact that it 's not charging monthly debit fees or fees for using online bill pay			2
however , it did cut back on its debit rewards program			0
last month @entity20 said it will no longer give rewards points for debit card transactions			2
that stemmed , in part , from changes in federal regulations that cut roughly in half the amount banks could charge retailers for processing purchases made on debit cards , a rule that 's cutting sharply into bank revenue			1
@entity20 's latest changes to its program include tweaks for how many points customers are awarded for direct deposits and other banking activity .			2

mid-tier checking accounts will see main changes
@entity20 will charge $ 20 a month on these accounts starting in december
customers with combined balances of $ 15,000 or more *exempt* from new fees
*announcement* comes after @entity103 said it will charge $ 5 per month for using debit cards starting next year
