the park is about 10 miles away from the famous @entity32 attraction in @entity33 , although staff there have not reported any lost primates			1
@entity5 , 17 , took a quick snap of the ' primate ' shortly before it scampered up a tree and out of sight she said she is certain the mysterious animal was not a dog or cat and believes it was a monkey that may be an escaped pet			1

it was ambling like one as well , on its arms and feet ' ' it looked about the size of a small gorilla			0

' i managed to get a photo but it quickly went out of sight			0
i could n't see it very clearly			0
