i would definitely say that and they are completely entitled to their own opinion			0
they pay good money to follow us around and support their club			0
' i am sure they have supported us for a number of years so they are definitely entitled to their opinion and i can understand their frustration			0
but i would n't put that on the manager			0
we have to stand up ourselves as players			0
' on that day [ at @entity15 ] , it was n't the manager 's fault we went 3 - 0 down like we did in the first half			1
