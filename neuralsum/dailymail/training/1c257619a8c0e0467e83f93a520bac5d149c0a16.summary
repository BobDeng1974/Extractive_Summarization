@entity0 claimed his young @entity2 team came of age after @entity4 ’s stunning double against @entity6 took the pressure off the head coach			1
@entity2 opened their @entity10 qualification campaign with a 2 - 0 victory in @entity12 to give @entity0 a major lift after last summer ’s disastrous @entity14			1
he said : ‘ we had an unfortunate time in @entity17 which was a kick in the teeth			2
now we can pick up our teeth , put them in and we go again			2
we ’ve been pushing that for a while now , about ownership and them making certain it ’s not just listening and following instructions , but understanding them and believing and knowing they can do it			0
‘ we did that from the first minute			0
this was always going to be a difficult game because @entity6 do n’t lose at home			1
the last time was when @entity2 beat them			1
' we missed some chances early on but , when @entity43 eventually scored , it was going to open up on the counter-attack			0
we can do that with the youth and energy of the team , and that showed to good effect			0
‘ these are our talented players			0
this is the way forward			0
we ’ve got to back them			0
‘ i ’m pleased we adopted a bold approach , asked a lot of these players , but only because if it ’s going to work in the future , if this group of players is to become any good , we ’ve got to do it from the start			0
three - sy does it : @entity2 's forwards combined for @entity4 's opener hotshot : @entity4 scored twice for the @entity2 in the @entity10 qualifier ‘ we had to go from the start as we mean to continue , and luckily we got the start which will help us			1
’ @entity4 scored opened the scoring after 58 minutes with a well - taken finished and close the game out with a second in injury time at @entity76			1
@entity0 added : ‘ i speak to him often and often i ’ve heard him say – i ’ve asked him what his best position is – centre - forward , but he understands fully that position was n’t available to him in the past in an @entity2 shirt			1
‘ others have got in the team before him			0
he ’s understood the need to do the job elsewhere			0
we changed the formation towards the end of the game and he was pushed wide and @entity90 on the other side			2
big threat : @entity93 ran the @entity95 defence ragged talking point : former @entity2 boss @entity97 ( right ) was an @entity98 pundit for the game in @entity12 alongside former @entity2 internationals @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 ' he ’s never complained			1
he ’s always said he ’d play where i wanted him to play , but i ’ve never been left in doubt that he wanted to play centrally			0
’ @entity0 changed his formation following the poor performance at @entity107 against @entity108 at last wednesday			1
@entity93 was outstanding playing just off @entity2 ’s two main strikers			2
@entity110 was also exceptional in goal			0
@entity0 added : ‘ we thought about the formation at the start of the week but decided against @entity108 to start in another way			2
‘ the performance against @entity108 , especially the latter part – we had a period of flux where we did n’t play too well for 15 - 20 minutes – and we were pleased when @entity90 moved into the middle and @entity4 went up front			1
’ tussle : @entity4 battles for possession with @entity124 @entity126 @entity2 players stepped up - @entity0			1

@entity0 happy with @entity2 side following 2 - 0 win in @entity6
three @entity2 boss *concedes* that young squad is still naive but will *improve*
two @entity4 goals sealed victory at @entity76 , @entity12
