by @entity0 and @entity1 a federal judge has lifted a temporary restraining order that had stopped the @entity5 military from force feeding a hunger - striking prisoner at @entity8 , saying the man 's life hangs in the balance			1
@entity5 district judge @entity12 said the military must be allowed to carry out force feeding in the case of @entity15 because of the ' very real probability that mr. @entity15 will die			1

@entity15 's lawyers have argued that the practice of forcibly extracting him and other prisoners from their cells , restraining them and feeding them through a tube inserted into their noses , was also illegal			1
the @entity40 has said the military only feeds prisoners against their will to keep them alive , and follows all laws when it does so			0
