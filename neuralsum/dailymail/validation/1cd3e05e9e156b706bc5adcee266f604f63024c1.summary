she 's suddenly been thrust into the limelight after accusing a talent show contestant of stealing someone else 's style - but according to users on @entity7 , @entity1 's own look is far from original			1
the @entity10 - born singer , 28 , was fired from the judging panel of @entity13 's @entity12 , along with her husband @entity14 , after accusing hopeful @entity15 of copying her spouse on sunday 's show			1
however , viewers have taken to social media to point out that @entity1 appears to have turned to a range of different artists including @entity22 , @entity23 and even @entity24 for fashion tips of her own			1
' as an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property , i am disgusted at how much you 've copied my husband			1
' @entity1 's comments seemed to be based around the fact that @entity15 had his hair slicked back and was wearing a suit , a look favoured by her fellow judge - and husband of ten months - @entity52			1
yet users on @entity7 soon posted pictures that showed how @entity1 's own hair and make - up bears a striking resemblance to styles worn by @entity59 and @entity60			1
some of the the funnier comparisons include @entity24 in @entity62 and @entity63 from @entity64			0
she 's even been compared to astrologer @entity66 and @entity23			2
@entity7 users were quick to comment on the fact that many of @entity1 's looks seem to have been influenced by other people , this hilarious example compares her to @entity24 in @entity62 @entity1 has also been accused of stealing looks from @entity23 , these two images show the two women rocking remarkably similar styles in one picture comparison on @entity7 , @entity1 's bun , blunt fringe and cat eye make - up looks similar to a look worn by @entity23			1
while other shots showed pictures of @entity1 posing with her hand over one eye which echoed one of @entity23 's own photo poses			1
another black and white shot of @entity1 sees her posing with fingers pointing at her temples , miming having a gun pointing to her head			1
@entity94 also posed the same way in a black and white photograph			0

@entity1 has always had her own style and many leading international designers are always sending her outfits			1
' this montage of pictures shows @entity1 looking strikingly similar to @entity23 ( right ) , @entity60 as @entity109 ( center ) and the singer @entity94 ( left ) another funny example compared @entity1 to @entity63 , an animated character from the hit movie @entity64 but in her x factor attack last night , @entity1 , who was born @entity1 , lambasted @entity15 further , saying : ' from the hair to the suit , do you not have any value for respect for originality ? ' she added : ‘ you 're a laughing stock			1
it 's cheesy , it 's disgusting , i personally found it artistically atrocious			0
' i am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion			0
' @entity15 , who was appearing on the first live episode looked visibly upset by her comments and at one point seemed to be fighting back the tears			1
her husband @entity14 , from @entity136 , who she married last may , added : ' to me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd			0
' it 's like @entity142 dressing up in his mother 's clothing , it feels a little creepy and i feel like you are going to stitch someone 's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience			0
' this user joked that the cartoon character @entity153 would be mad that @entity1 had stolen her hairstyle there has been several posts which compare @entity1 to @entity23 , here the pair shares a similar hair style and sunglasses to the singer and @entity1 's outburst was n't the first time she had raised eyebrows while filming the @entity12			1
when she first joined the show she was criticised after one round of auditions in @entity167 where she apparently swore and screamed at audience members , which included children			0
at the time a representative for the show confirmed the incident saying : ' during a long day of filming , @entity174 judge @entity1 expressed frustration at the behaviour of some sections of the audience			2
' her words were not well chosen , and both @entity1 and @entity181 apologise for any offence caused			2
' since being dropped from the talent show , @entity1 tweeted saying : ' i love you guys , thanks for your support & understanding my passionate opinions ! you know what they say about me ... ' she added a link to her video for her song problem which includes the chorus , ' that girl is a problem			2
' @entity1 's hair has been compared to @entity22 ( centre ) and even @entity66 ( left ) this @entity7 user joked that @entity202 had called and wanted her hair back but who is this controversial singer and songwriter who , despite working with @entity202 and the @entity208 @entity207 , until last night was barely known in her home country ? born in @entity211 , the grammar school girl travelled extensively with her parents between @entity213 , the @entity214 and @entity215			1

' i was just completely out of control of my erratic feelings of love and passionate desperation			0
' yet @entity1 has admitted in the past that she feels remorse over her actions , telling @entity269 that her album @entity270 was inspired by her rocky life : ' you know what ? i do have regrets			2

there was a point where i left home and was trying to be a grown - up			2
i had an awful boyfriend who treated me badly			0
