by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 18:46 est , 8 november 2012 middle - aged women who had taken the @entity2 for just five years still performed better on cognitive tests than those who had never taken it the contraceptive pill could prevent women getting dementia years after they have stopped taking it , according to research			1
women in their 50s who had been on the drug when they were younger performed far better in memory tests than those who had never taken it			1
experts think that the key hormone in the @entity2 , oestrogen , prevents the arteries hardening , which increases the blood supply to the brain , helping stave off the illness			1
for some years scientists have known that @entity26 , which also contains oestrogen , seems to protect against dementia			0
but little was known about the potential benefits of the @entity2			1
@entity31 scientists looked at 261 women aged 40 to 65 who were surveyed on their health			2
they underwent a series of tests on their memory , including naming certain objects and listing as many words as they could on a given subject			0
researchers from the @entity41 found that women who had taken the @entity2 performed significantly better in some of the tests			1
they also found that the longer the women had been on the @entity2 , the higher their scores			1
although the study did not directly look at the risks of dementia , adults whose brains are sharper in middle age are thought to be far less at risk of the illness			0
experts think that oestrogen , the main hormone in the @entity2 , helps maintain the function of the brain in two ways			2
firstly , they believe it prevents the arteries from becoming blocked , which keeps a steady flow of blood to the brain			0
they also suspect it may encourage the growth of certain cells in the brain and spinal cord			0
lead researcher @entity70 , whose study is published in the @entity72 , said : ‘ our analysis indicated that hormonal contraceptive use may have a protective cognitive [ memory ] effect , even years after use is discontinued			2
this is especially true in subjects with a longer duration of use			0
’ while the contraceptive pill has been shown to protect against some cancers such as ovarian and bowel , it is thought to raise the risk of breast tumours .			0

middle - aged women who had taken the @entity2 for five years still performed better on cognitive tests *compared* to those who had *n't*
beneficial effects increased the longer the women had taken the hormones
