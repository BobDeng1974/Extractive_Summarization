ordeal : @entity1 appeared at two sensational trials over the past few weeks it has been an extraordinarily painful and harrowing week for @entity4			1
she had the satisfaction of seeing @entity8 ’s partner in crime @entity9 – who raped her when she was an innocent 15 - year - old – convicted for numerous offences for which he is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail			1
then , in a bizarre coincidence , days after giving evidence against @entity9 she flew to @entity18 to face the ‘ nightmare ’ of appearing as a witness in the high - profile trial of businessman @entity22 for the murder of his wealthy @entity25 girlfriend @entity24			1
bizarrely , the two sensational trials both reached a verdict on friday with @entity22 , like @entity9 , found guilty			1
waiving her right to anonymity and speaking about her ordeal for the first time , @entity1 , 61 , said : ‘ friday was a simply incredible because both the trials finished on the same day			1
it was an amazing coincidence			2
‘ i had got back from @entity32 the day before and to be watching the news with both these trials involving myself leading the broadcasts was unreal			2
‘ obviously i was delighted that @entity9 was convicted and that included his offences against me			1
‘ i just wish my evidence had made a difference to @entity22			1
’ the verdict in @entity18 disappointed her as she was there as a witness for the defence , and gave a damning character reference against @entity24 , who had once been part of her social set in the @entity47 nightclub scene			1
@entity1 added : ‘ it has been the most stressful time of my life and i have found it very difficult to sleep with the knowledge of what i had to do			1
‘ now i feel exhausted but very proud for having helped to put @entity9 behind bars			1
‘ i just hope that now other women will feel confident enough to come forward and report the abuse they suffered at his hands			2
’ @entity1 said it is the @entity9 trial that will haunt her			1
she revealed she was left particularly distraught because she had to face up to the memory of introducing a 12 - year - old friend to @entity9 , who was then raped by him while she was in the same room			1
‘ i saw that particular victim in the lead up to his trial and i apologised for what had happened all those years ago			2
she just said that it had stolen her childhood from her and that she had tried to forget it			2
‘ she did n’t want to dig up the past and there must be hundreds of young girls in the same position			2
‘ @entity9 was a very cunning paedophile			1
he would do what he wanted to do and just act like nothing had happened			2
he even befriended my parents and would drop me off in his @entity81 when it was time for me to go home			2
‘ we were so naive			0
i would n’t have known how to tell my parents			0
because i did not have the experience of screaming and pushing him off me , i did not realise i had been raped			2
’ partners in crime : disgraced @entity88 and tv presenter @entity8 and his chauffeur @entity9 ( right ) soak up the sun in the 1970s charity event : @entity24 ( second from the left ) and @entity1 ( second right ) pictured together at a party such was @entity1 ’s level of naivety that when @entity9 latched on to her mention of a 12 - year - old friend she thought nothing of introducing them			1
‘ i had mentioned her to him and he had encouraged me to bring her round , ’ she said			0
‘ we were all lying down on his bed with @entity9 in the middle			1
then he said to my friend , “ this is not going to hurt ” , and got on top of her			0
‘ i just lay there frozen to the spot while they had sex			0
when he finished he just started chatting away about his @entity88 - ing. it was as though nothing had happened			2
’ @entity1 was a pupil at @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 , in the summer of 1968 when she first encountered @entity9 , then 27 , who had made his name as a dj on the pirate station @entity120			1
she said : ‘ he lived with three other young djs on the ground floor of a three - storey townhouse in @entity124			2
my older sister happened to be renting the top floor and i would often go round to see her after school			0
if my sister was n’t in , @entity9 would invite me into his flat to wait for her			1
he had the largest room in the house – on the ground floor with a big bay window			0
there were pictures of him with the @entity137 on the wall and in the middle of the room was a kingsize bed			0
‘ i suppose i was flattered by the attention and it was n’t until the third occasion that anything happened			0
‘ he told me to lie down on the bed and said he was not going to hurt me			0
he came and lay on top of me			0
before i really knew what was happening he was having sex with me			0
‘ there was no tenderness			0
over the seven years he abused me , he never kissed me			0
he would just have sex , pass me a tissue and then start talking like nothing had happened			0
‘ had i ended up running out of his house i might have thought of myself as a victim but he was very clever			0
he would always keep me there for an extra hour			0
he told me how lucky i was that i had lost my virginity to him rather than to another man who might have hurt me			0
’ @entity9 ( left ) and businessman @entity22 ( right ) arriving art court in @entity117 and @entity18 respectively last week @entity9 , 73 , who used to be known by the nickname ‘ @entity162 ’ , was convicted of 18 offences against 11 separate victims aged 13 to 15			1
the offences were committed between 1962 to 1978 and the court heard that while some victims had been able to get on with their lives , others were ‘ very significantly damaged ’			0
a few years after the abuse had begun , @entity1 began dating @entity172 ’s housemate and fellow dj @entity173			1
@entity9 was n’t bothered about me seeing @entity173 because he had so many schoolgirls visiting him at that time , ’ she said			1
‘ but if @entity173 and i fell out or he was in the house with me alone then he would force himself on to me again			0
’ at the time , @entity9 provided djs for some of the @entity47 ’s most popular night spots			1
he was also very close to @entity180 , acting as his chauffeur on occasions			0
@entity1 said : ‘ i met @entity8 once			1
@entity9 and @entity173 had moved to a big detached house that we called @entity185			1
i was lying on the floor reading a book when @entity8 came in			1
‘ he saw me and began to flirt			0
i remember he put his foot on my back and said he was going to walk on me			0
@entity9 gave him a glare and @entity173 took me out of there			1
‘ the strain of what was happening at @entity195 put paid to my relationship with @entity173			0
i could n’t understand why he and the other djs could not stop @entity198 from seducing so many schoolgirls			0
’ living in the @entity47 meant that throughout her life she would occasionally bump into @entity172 in a bar , a club or at the shops			0
@entity1 , who has five children from two different relationships , said : ‘ we would usually say hello and nothing more			2
‘ on one occasion i saw him when i was shopping with my ten - year - old daughter who was a particularly pretty little girl			1
‘ @entity9 immediately started asking who she was and looking for an introduction			2
i rushed her away from him			0
it made me feel sick			0
’ @entity1 went on to be a successful businesswoman running bars and nightclubs in the @entity47 , and was delighted when the death of @entity8 triggered a re-examination of historical sex abuse			1
the @entity220 in @entity18 where the @entity25 millionairess was found murdered by her boyfriend to help secure @entity9 ’s conviction she gave three video - recorded interviews to detectives but then also went to @entity226 to give evidence			1
‘ i had no screen , ’ she said , ‘ and @entity9 was intimidating me throughout my evidence but i was determined that justice should be done			1
‘ @entity9 was just a few feet away from me and he spent the entire time making eye contact with me , nodding and shaking his head			2
‘ i held it together really well			0
i stood for the whole time clinging on to a rail and the only time i cried was when i had to recall going to see a counsellor when i was 50 years old			0
‘ that brought it home to me just how this man had ruined my life			0
’ it was just days after giving evidence against @entity9 that @entity1 was called to be a witness in the case of @entity22			1
@entity1 said she had become involved after pictures of her and @entity24 emerged and she was contacted by @entity22 ’s distraught mother , @entity249			1
‘ she asked me what i knew of @entity252 and how i could help , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ well , i knew @entity24 from 2002 when she was dating a friend of mine called @entity255			0
@entity24 admitted to me that she had a problem with drink which made her violent			0
on one occasion i saw her slap @entity261 across the face at a party and on another occasion she left him badly scarred			0
‘ no one deserves what she went through but i thought it was important that the @entity32 court knew what she could be like			0
’ @entity22 was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment			1
@entity1 said : ‘ i was very surprised that he received such a long sentence			2
’ she described the @entity18 trial as ‘ a complete nightmare ’			1
‘ i was shown to a waiting room which was full of @entity24 ’s friends and family and i felt awful knowing that my testimony was going to upset them all			2
‘ it was very uncomfortable but having been contacted by @entity22 ’s mother i felt duty - bound to say what i knew about @entity24 ’s behaviour in relationships and her problem controlling her temper when drunk			1

@entity1 gave evidence at two sensational trials in the past week
