@entity1 fans are no strangers to watching their team 's young talents get farmed out on loan to various corners of the world , but the curious case of @entity8 is one that has left the @entity9 faithful with a few raised eyebrows			1
once labelled the next @entity13 , @entity8 was so sought after in 2007 that @entity1 risked a @entity15 transfer ban to acquire the @entity17 's signature			2
the west @entity19 club were close to being banned from signing new players for two transfer windows in 2009 after @entity22 claimed @entity1 illegally induced the @entity17 - youth team player to join @entity1			1
journeyman : @entity8 has been loaned out to six different clubs in during his time at @entity1 bright start : @entity8 celebrates scoring against @entity27 during the @entity29 final first leg in 2008 luckily for the @entity9 , @entity22 agreed to drop the complaint after being paid a fee of around £ 1million for @entity8			2
it 's now been three years and eight months since @entity8 has made a senior appearance for @entity1 to add to his just six @entity35 showings in a blue shirt , which is a figure that looks less and less likely to increase as the former @entity22 youngster embarks on his sixth loan move			0
the 23 - year - old has now been shipped out to @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 but not one club has been impressed enough to enquire about a long - term deal for @entity8			1
rare : the @entity17 youngster celebrates with @entity50 during a @entity52 match in 2009 risk : @entity8 signed for @entity1 in 2007 from @entity22 in a move that was shrouded in controversy former @entity57 prodigies @entity58 and @entity59 are further example of @entity1 's youth development system going awry			1
the pair moved to the @entity9 in 2006 in another highly controversial transfer after former @entity1 chairman @entity64 accused his old side of ' tapping up ' the talented duo			0
@entity1 were eventually ordered to pay £ 5million in compensation to the @entity69 outfit for two players that failed to make the grade having been given little chance to impress			0
@entity58 did n't make a single appearance for the @entity1 first team while @entity59 made a handful of substitute appearances before moving on			0
although @entity1 's managerial merry - go - round over the last six years wo n't have helped @entity8 's cause , there is clearly underlying issues whether its his attitude or lack of attitude at the top level			0
@entity8 is n't the first and is unlikely to be the last promising youngster to fall foul of @entity1 's loan system , with 26 players currently plying their trade away from @entity91			2
21 - year - old midfielder @entity92 looks to be another @entity9 youngster that has failed to fit in after a bright start in the @entity1 first team set - up			1
shipped out : the 23 - year - old has n't played a competitive game for @entity1 in five years out : the 23 - year - old has now been shipped out to @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 @entity92 blossomed under @entity100 in 2010 , but failed to gain similar trust from other @entity1 managers since the @entity104 's sacking in 2011			1
if he could have his time again , @entity8 may wish that he could start again with @entity105 at a time in which the @entity1 boss looks keen to give opportunities to the current crop of @entity91 youngsters			0
the @entity17 may have been over land and sea in an attempt to prove himself in different colours , but his time at @entity1 looks all but over			0
blue : @entity8 is consoled by @entity116 after his penalty was saved against @entity118 in 2009 off again : the @entity17 winger signed a season - long loan deal with @entity45 this summer			2

@entity8 has n't played for @entity1 since *january* 2011
23 - year - old has been loaned out to six different clubs *including* @entity40 and @entity41
@entity17 winger joins 26 other @entity9 players currently out on loan
@entity8 signed for @entity1 from @entity22 as a @entity17 youth team player in 2007
