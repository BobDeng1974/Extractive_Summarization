a court heard he set up the @entity14 trust to help ex-armed forces personnel suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to return to civilian life			2
@entity7 , ( right ) pictured here with @entity18 ( left ) , spent the money intended for former service personnel on speedboats and gambling but the 51 - year - old splashed out on speedboats , gambling debts , high living and trying to romance three women at the same time			1
@entity28 convinced the @entity30 government he was legitimate through lying about his own very brief army career and giving ' expert ' evidence to parliamentary and @entity30 government committees about post-traumatic stress disorder and the impact on soldiers leaving the forces			2
he won over politicians , probation workers , senior police officers and even convinced war veterans like former welsh guardsman @entity18 that he wanted to help struggling servicemen and women			1
it operated a hotel in @entity48 , @entity49 , a nine - house supported housing project on @entity52 and a caravan site			2
but instead of ploughing the £ 125,000 government grant into helping ex-servicemen he stole from his own organisation to lead a luxury lifestyle until the money ran out			1
@entity7 conned £ 125,000 out of the @entity30 government to set up a scheme to help injured soldiers the court heard @entity7 transferred £ 74,800 from the @entity14 bank account into his own			1
he lost £ 20,00 in an account with @entity67 bookmakers and ripped off a dying woman by persuading her to invest £ 30,000 in his hotel renovation and continued to cash cheques from her account after she died			1
the truth caught up with him after @entity14 co-director @entity74 became suspicious about his lifestyle and asked him to show her the accounts			2
when he refused , ms @entity74 and fellow co-director @entity80 suspended him and discovered there was only £ 500 left instead of £ 90,000			2

he may well have enjoyed more than £ 100,000 but no - one will trust him ever again			2

' i would n't want to be in his shoes			0
we have millions of veterans in this country and families with serving members			2

' he is a congenital liar incapable of managing his financial affairs			1
' judge @entity138 branded his crime ' wicked ' and said he was stunned by a lack of basic checks into his background : ' this was nothing other than a sophisticated high value scam			1
' it was a wicked deception on the public purse			1
any right - minded person would be sickened			0
' your wicked lies involve deceiving vulnerable former soldiers who had truly served their country and meant something , who had seen horrors and had their lives blighted			2
' the best assessment of you was from 30 years in an army report which said you were a congenital liar			1
' it is astounding that the @entity92 did n't make the basic checks into the company and you were given the money without proper checks			0
' @entity166 mp @entity165 , a prominent campaigner for veterans , was taken in by @entity7			1
after his conviction , mr @entity165 said : ' he could talk the birds down off the trees to be honest			0
' he was perfectly plausible			0
he 'd been in several meetings with some very high powered ex-service people and the whole group of people we deal with in committees in @entity178			0
' i do n't think anybody suspected anything			0
' @entity7 had a previous conviction for dishonesty after stealing jewellery from his employers in 1985			1
mr @entity165 is now calling for an inquiry into how his background was n't checked in more detail before being handed such large sums of public money			0
after the sentencing , mr @entity18 called for tighter controls on keeping checks grants to veterans ' organisations			2
