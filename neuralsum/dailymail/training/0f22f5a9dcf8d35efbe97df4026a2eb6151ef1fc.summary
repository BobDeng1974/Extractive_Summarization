a man died 72 hours after suffering crippling headaches when doctors failed to diagnose a deadly infection			1
@entity4 was taken to hospital in @entity6 after being struck by the extreme pain as well as numbness , with medics fearing he was suffering a stroke			1
but after ordering an mri scan , to check for anything untoward in the brain , doctors failed to check the results of the test			1
the failure to read the results , attributed to a breakdown in communication , led to the 42 - year - old 's death just hours later			1
mr @entity4 was found to have suffered a brain abscess - a pus - filled swelling caused by an infection			1
@entity4 , pictured on his wedding day with wife @entity26 , died 72 hours after suffering crippling headaches and numbness the scan , carried out on february 8 , 2013 , revealed he required urgent treatment			1
but it was n't until february 12 - a day after mr @entity4 ' death - that doctors realised their error			1
his wife , @entity26 , said she has been left devastated by the sudden loss of her husband			0
she has questioned whether his life could have been saved , had the infection which led to the abscess been picked up straight away			2
a serious incident report , carried out by the @entity42 , which runs @entity43 , highlighted a lack of communication between medical teams as being the reason for the mri scan being left unchecked			1
mrs @entity49 , 50 , said : ' it 's heartbreaking that i have lost the love of my life in just 72 hours			0
' there is n't a second that goes by that i do n't think about @entity4			2
' our doctor first suggested we go to @entity59 when @entity4 started suffering from numbness and headaches - they thought he was having a stroke			1
' but when we got to hospital he was given an mri but no - one checked the scan			2
' @entity4 died just hours later while in hospital , it 's shocking			1
' we were told a brain abscess is nearly always fatal without treatment but you can survive if they are treated quickly			2
' the 42 - year - old was admitted to @entity43 near @entity6 and doctors ordered an @entity77 scan the couple fell in love online in 2010 , with mr @entity4 travelling down to @entity80 from his home in @entity82 to meet his wife - to - be for the first time			1
she said they immediately fell for one another and married the following year			0
she added : ' he agreed to come and see me in @entity80 and he never went back			0
' we 'd already agreed to get married before he came to see me as we just clicked , and we had a big wedding with all of our family and friends there			0
' mrs @entity49 suffers from severe arthritis and her husband was acting as her full - time career at the time of his death			0
she said : ' @entity4 was healthy and active , there were no warning signs that he was severely ill from a brain infection			2
' he had been suffering from some headaches and feeling weak and so went to the doctors			2
i could never imagine he 'd go into hospital and not come out			0
what good is an apology from the hospital when i have lost the man i loved , and the man who loved me ? ' we had so much in common , it really felt we were meant to be together , soulmates			0
' i thought we 'd be together forever			0
i ca n't move on with my life now			0
it stopped the day he died			0
i 'll never look to be in another relationship as @entity4 was my one true love			2
' following legal action , the health board has offered an ' unreserved apology ' and has agreed to pay mrs @entity49 bereavement damages to compensate for her loss			0
a spokesperson for the @entity42 said : ' we offer our sincere condolences to mr @entity4 ' family for their sad loss , and apologise for the shortcomings in his care			1
' a thorough review was carried out and action has been taken to minimise the risk of it happening again			0
' the health board has introduced new procedures for reporting urgent or unexpected radiological findings to avoid unnecessary delay			2
but due to a breakdown in communication , the scan results were not read by doctors			1
mr @entity4 was found to have had a brain abscess , caused by an infection			1
his widow @entity26 , 50 , said she is devastated by the sudden loss of her husband ' @entity148 also contributed to the development of new all - @entity80 guidance by the @entity151			2
' other action includes improving inpatient medical cover provision and the supervision of junior trainees out of hours			0
' the health board will introduce additional measures during the course of this year			0
' solicitor @entity159 , of @entity160 , added : ' the errors made in this case are completely unacceptable			0
there can be no excuse at all for their failings at this hospital , and these failings have come at the ultimate cost			0
' for a hospital to carry out an mri scan on a patient , and then simply fail to follow - up on the results , is beyond shocking			1
' mr @entity4 was left with his condition deteriorating over the weekend and without the treatment he needed because medical teams simply failed to communicate with one another about the seriousness of his situation			1
