the president of a @entity2 university won the ire of much his student body on sunday with an email that suggested sexual assaults can be blamed on booze and promiscuity			1
@entity10 president dr. @entity9 , 69 , told the @entity12 's 1,800 students to avoid rape by abstaining from casual sex and avoiding alcohol			1
outrage : president of @entity17 's @entity10 , dr. @entity9 , has infuriated students with an ' open letter ' that blames booze and casual sex on rape ' @entity23 in the area of sexuality is its own reward , and has been held in high esteem in @entity29 for millennia because those who are virtuous are happier as well as healthier , ' @entity9 wrote			1
the email appeared to be in response to a growing national conversation about rape -- and more specifically , the sexual assault problems on many college campuses -- but not everyone found the president 's words helpful			1
some think just the opposite			0
' i 'm pretty p * * * * * off , ' sophomore @entity44 , 19 , told the @entity45			2
' that 's a pretty insensitive thing to say			2
' @entity47 has generated comes from what appears to be his blaming student culture for sexual violence			0
' you know that these incidents are almost always preceded by consumption , often heavy consumption , of alcohol , often by everyone involved in them , ' he wrote			1
not everyone knows , however			0
' i do n't think casual sex is in any way related to sexual assault ; the problem is people breaking boundaries and not learning respect from a young age , ' said 18 - year - old @entity68			1
alumnus @entity69 , who started a @entity71 petition urging president @entity9 to address the controversy , agreed			1
' i believe that laying the blame solely at the feet of the two issues you mentioned is an injustice to those affected by sexual assault , and will not solve the problem , ' wrote @entity82 , whose petition had over 70 signers by thursday morning			0
few , if any , students , have come out to support the president 's letter			1
however , some appear to believe he meant well , at least			0
@entity9 told the @entity91 school 's 1,800 undergrads that ' virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward , and has been held in high esteem in @entity29 for millennia ' ' i do n't think he meant any harm , but he did n't put it very well , ' student @entity98 told @entity101			1
' he used the words " casual sex " but that does n't necessarily have anything to do with sexual assault			0
he just used the wrong words			0
' specific to casual sex , the president wrote : ' no one 's culture or character or understanding is improved by casual sex , and the physical and psychological risks to both genders are profound			2
' in an interview with the @entity45 , @entity9 largely just restated what he 'd already said in the letter			1
in response to the backlash , he only challenged his critics : if its not booze and floosiness , what does cause rape ? ' but so far , ' @entity9 said , ' they have n't told me what you really ought to blame it on			1
' dear @entity10 students , as you know , the college has launched an educational and awareness campaign to attempt to minimize sexual harassment and assault in our community			2
the goal is to raise the awareness of all community members with respect to sexual harassment and assault and to help prevent those incidents by that increased awareness			2
you also know that our college is not alone in its concern about such behavior , principally among its students			0
and you know that these incidents are almost always preceded by consumption , often heavy consumption , of alcohol , often by everyone involved in them			1
you can do your part in helping this college and this culture address this nexus of problems by doing two relatively simple things : 1			0
by limiting your own consumption of alcohol , and encouraging your friends to do the same			2
@entity174 included wine at his symposium , but he did not get drunk			0
you can be thoughtful about the dramatic and often negative psychological effects that sexual activity without commitment can have			0
virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward , and has been held in high esteem in @entity29 for millennia because those who are virtuous are happier as well as healthier			1
no one ’s culture or character or understanding is improved by casual sex , and the physical and psychological risks to both genders are profound			0
every year at the end of the @entity198 , i say to the graduating class , “ i hope you feel not only well taught , but well loved			2
” i mean every word of that			0
this open letter is written in that spirit – not as preachment , but with great affection and true , deep and lasting concern			1
as always , i am available for your responses or a visit to my office			0
i wish each of you good luck in your final weeks of the semester , and a happy , healthy , virtuous 2015			0
sincerely , @entity9 president source : @entity45			2
