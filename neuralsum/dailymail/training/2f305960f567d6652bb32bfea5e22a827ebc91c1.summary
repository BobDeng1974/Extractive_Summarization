by @entity0 published : 03:18 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 6 august 2013 row : celebrated chef @entity1 is at the centre of a row after two @entity5 restaurants claimed they produced the best fish and chips he had ever tasted when top tv chef @entity1 told @entity9 her fish and chips were the best he ’d ever tasted , she could n’t wait to tell the world			1
she put up signs at the @entity13 , as well as an advertising board on the pavement outside her business in the bustling @entity18 port , quoting the comment by her @entity21 fan			1
but now a war of words has broken out after the neighbouring @entity25 establishment , on a shiny new advertising board , attributed similar words of praise about their fish and chips to a surname-less ‘ @entity1 ’			1
@entity25 , just along from mrs @entity9 ’s shop in @entity32 , is run by the @entity34 family , who have served fish and chips to the people of @entity13 for three generations			1
the board outside @entity39 quotes ‘ @entity1 ’ saying : ‘ best fish and chips i ’ve ever had ’ – while the one at the @entity13 quotes @entity1 saying : ‘ the best fish and chips i ’ve ever tasted			1
’ mrs @entity9 , who has been running the @entity13 for eight years , said the sign went up outside her shop to try and encourage business			1
she said : ‘ @entity1 said our fish and chips were the best he had ever tasted			1
we were in his programme @entity50 and he was seen coming out of our shop with fish and chips			1
bruised and battered : @entity9 said she could n't wait just could n't wait to tell the world how much @entity1 loved her food the sign : this is the one that is linked to the @entity13 but a rival has apparently tried to claim the same ‘ we thought we would promote it , so we put signs up a couple of years ago and people are always commenting on it			1
‘ the reason i put the signs up was because i did n’t want people getting confused with the other place , it was just a bit of marketing			0
‘ but then one of my staff came in with a photo of their new sign			2
i think it is misleading the public , saying “ @entity1 ”			2
it might not say @entity1 , but it says @entity1 and it is blatantly obvious they are trying to confuse people			2
‘ i feel that they are trying to undermine me in my business			0
there is plenty in the town for everyone , but they want the biggest piece of the pie			0
‘ how would they like it if i put a sign outside saying : “ three generations of fish - frying excellence ? ” ’ @entity93 said @entity25 did not wish to comment			1
war : neighbouring shop @entity25 in @entity96 attributed similar words of praise about their fish and chips notice : their sign attributes the message to a mysterious ' @entity1 ' , but critics say this clearly links to mr @entity1 it is the second time that tv chef @entity1 has been at the centre of a local culinary storm			1
in 2000 , he left a bad taste in the mouths of staff at a sea life museum as he filmed for the new television series			0
staff at the @entity116 in @entity96 claimed @entity1 borrowed five of their lovingly nurtured colony of rare horse mussels , known as ‘ clabby doos ’ , but only returned four of them			1
and they believe the tv chef ate one raw after a fisherman showed him the best way to eat it			0
programme : @entity1 's @entity128 is currently being shown on the @entity129 , another of the chef 's culinary adventures which previously included a trip to @entity13 on his ' @entity50 ' show museum curator @entity135 said : ‘ we ’d had our horse mussels for seven years and we had n’t nurtured them for so long just to provide a tasty treat for @entity1			1
’ but @entity1 ’s production staff laughed off the claims			2
programme producer @entity140 said : ‘ i can assure you that if @entity1 had eaten a raw mussel after it had been in a tank for seven years then he might not be with us now			1
‘ i do n’t think they would have been very edible			0
he did open one up so that we could see what it looked like inside , but i have to say it was n’t very appetising and he certainly did n’t eat it			0
‘ @entity1 may have thought about eating one on camera – but he would not have dreamed of actually doing so			2
’ nevertheless , @entity1 has helped to make the traditional fish and chip supper a staple across the country			1
experts have credited him with helping to boost tourism both locally and nationally			0
his second fish and chip shop opened in @entity160 almost three years ago			0
the @entity162 town centre shop has a sister outlet in @entity164			0
@entity165 , a specialist in the sociology of tourism , said the shops would generate wealth for the region through increasing visitors			0
mr @entity165 , from the @entity172 , said : ‘ restaurants are normally secondary attractions – you think about where you are going to eat once you have arrived			0
‘ but a celebrity chef turns a restaurant into a primary tourist attraction because it becomes part of the reason to visit			0
‘ tourist attractions like these generate wealth for the region by increasing the volume of incoming visitors and , more controversially , for second - home ownership			0
’ figures show around £ 1 out of every £ 100 consumers spend on food is handed over to the local chip shop			0
according to recent surveys , the @entity190 are most likely to prefer to fry their chips in the traditional fashion , rather than opt for the oven - cooked varieties			0
during @entity199 , fish and chips – once described by @entity197 as ‘ the good companions ’ – escaped rationing			2
@entity1 ’s new programme , @entity1 ’s @entity128 : the search for the @entity203 , started on @entity204 this week .			2
