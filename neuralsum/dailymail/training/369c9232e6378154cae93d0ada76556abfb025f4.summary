city are restricted to only 16 ‘ foreign ’ players in their @entity13 squad as punishment for breaching @entity16 regulations			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it is always difficult to take a player out of the list but we have restrictions this year			1
we brought @entity9 because i think that we need another striker , a box player , and in the position of @entity1 maybe we have some other options			1
it is a difficult decision but i think it was the best for the squad			2
’ @entity1 has been dropped from @entity3 's @entity7 squad the @entity3 players trained ahead of saturday 's fixture at the @entity32 against @entity33 @entity0 ( centre ) has said that @entity1 is still part of his future plans at the @entity37 however @entity3 had to make way for £ 28million signing @entity9 , here in action for the @entity41 @entity9 , signed from @entity42 , has leaped ahead of @entity1 in the @entity3 pecking order @entity1 has struggled to hold down a first - team place at the @entity37 since joining from @entity45 for £ 22m in the summer of 2013			1
@entity3 turned down a loan offer from @entity47 during the january transfer window but it is understood that the @entity50 champions would have considered selling the 25 - year - old if they could have recouped their money			1
@entity0 confirmed that the player ’s situation would be assessed in the summer but does not think that his exclusion from the @entity7 squad means that he will definitely leave the @entity37			1
‘ no , i do n’t think that one thing has a link with the other thing , ’ said the @entity3 boss			1
‘ it is very important for @entity1 to try to play now until the end of the season to play as much games as he can and not be injured and try to have a high performance every time he plays			1
after the end of the season , we analyse not only for @entity1 , for all the squad which will continue the next year			1
‘ he will be a positive player			2
he continues being very important player			2
if we did n’t have the restrictions we ’d have another place			0
he ’s a good professional and i ’m sure we ’ll see him playing in the @entity50			0
the @entity74 players were taken for a warm up during a light training session on friday morning @entity77 is put through his paces by @entity79 ( left ) @entity80 and @entity81 ( both centre ) @entity83 stretches his muscles in a warm up ( left ) whilst @entity81 lunges for a loose pass ( right ) @entity1 , controlling the ball in training with @entity89 ( left ) and @entity83 , is wanted by @entity47 the @entity3 players were in a jubilant mood before heading out to the pitches at @entity3 's luxury training complex ‘ he will be a positive player			1

’ city trail leaders @entity97 by five points following their draw at @entity100 last weekend ahead of saturday ’s game at home to @entity33			2
@entity0 , who confirmed that both @entity103 and @entity104 are fit after injury , acknowledged that his team did not play well in january but believes they remain within striking distance of the title			2
he added : ‘ when you have to play 45 points more , you can close the gap , of course you can do it			0
but is important for our team to try and be near the top of the table as soon as you can , and the only thing you can do is to improve your performance , to repeat what we did in december and wait until @entity97 drop points			0
@entity79 concentrates as he selects his footwear before the chilly training session in @entity124 @entity80 was wrapped up warm as he picked up his boots from the plentiful boot room ‘ the last two times this team won the title was coming from behind so i suppose we can do it for a third time			0
‘ january was not a good month			0
we changed again our style of play			0
we had to arrange our team without strikers			0
after that the strikers came back and they have to have to have minutes again			0
the @entity97 game will be a switch of performance because we played a very good game playing away against the best team of the @entity50			0
i am sure we will see the team again we are normally used to seeing			0
‘ i am sure that playing as we did against @entity97 and recovering the goals we score at home , we are going to be an important team from now until the end			0
