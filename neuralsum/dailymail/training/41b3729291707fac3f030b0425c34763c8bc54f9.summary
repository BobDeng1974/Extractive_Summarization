but while most of us can shrug them off with little thought , @entity5 fears the worst			1
the 25 - year - old is battling a rare and progressive condition that is turning her into a human statue			2
' i try not to think about the future ' : @entity5 is battling a rare and progressive condition which is turning her muscle into bone , slowly transforming her into a human statue it causes her muscles to turn to bone and even the slightest knock can accelerate this extra growth and freeze her into place			1
her neck is already locked into position and she ca n't move her head			1
she has restricted movement in her jaw and is unable to raise her arms above her head			1
large , painful ribbons of bone have also formed across her back			2
now , she faces a race against time to find a cure before she becomes locked in her own skeleton			1
@entity5 , who is originally from @entity38 , @entity39 , but now lives in @entity40 , said : ' it 's a progressive condition so it 's only going to get worse			1
' i try not to think about the future			2
there 's no point in thinking like that			2
my biggest fear though is it going into my legs			1
i do n't want to be in a wheelchair			1
i really like having my independence			2
' came on suddenly : @entity5 aged three			1
most sufferers with her condition are diagnosed when toddlers , but she did not show any symptoms until her teens the condition , fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ( @entity58 ) , makes even the simplest of everyday tasks difficult			2
@entity5 is unable to drive , struggles to get dressed and even brush her hair			1
it is so rare , only about 45 people in the @entity64 have been diagnosed with it			0
sufferers are usually diagnosed as toddlers , but amazingly , @entity5 did n't show any symptoms until she was 15			1
she said : ' i had been absolutely fine but one day i fell over			0
a huge lump appeared on my back			0
it was right across my shoulder blade			0
' the swelling was the size of my palm and very red			0
it was hot and extremely painful			0
i could n't lie on it or put any pressure on it			2
' extremely rare : @entity5 aged 14 , a year before she first noticed symptoms when she fell over one day and a huge lump appeared on her back when it did n't go down after a few days , her worried mum took her to the hospital			1
doctors feared she had cancer and took a biopsy but it came back clear			0
they put her on a course of steroids to help reduce the swelling and she was kept in hospital			0
however , lumps developed at the back of @entity5 's neck and the other side of her back			1
she was then diagnosed with necrotising proliferative myositis , a rare disease where muscle fibers and skin become inflamed and damaged			0
medics were just about to give her treatment when a consultant stopped them			0
@entity5 said : ' he asked me to take off my socks			1
i thought it was a really strange question			0
' he looked at my toes and said i had fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva			0
' the consultant noticed @entity5 's big toe was shorter than her second toe , which is a classic sign of @entity58			1
x-rays and further tests confirmed the diagnosis			0
@entity5 said : ' it 's so rare , hardly any of the doctors had heard of it			1
i was just lucky he had come across it before			0
' he told me the one thing i should never do is look it up on the internet but when someone tells you not to do something , you do it			0
' i was terrified when i read what might happen to me , but then i thought i had to get on with it			0
' i could feel the lumps growing			0
we did n't know what to do			2
i would nearly pass out because the pain was so bad			0
' her parents @entity140 and @entity141 sought out a specialist who warned them @entity5 should avoid most things children her age enjoy , like sports			1
but brave @entity5 was determined her condition was not going to hold her back and she sat her gcses in hospital , achieving six a * s and two as			1
she went on to complete her a levels before securing a place at @entity152 to study @entity153			0
' incredibly determined ' : lucy with her mother , @entity155 , who is the chairman of the charity @entity156 @entity64			0
she says she is proud of her daughter 's positive attitude to the condition despite facing a daily struggle , @entity5 has a full - time job with a bio-medical science publishing company			1
she said : ' there are a lot of things i ca n't do but i do n't like to see it like that			1
' i 'd like children in the future but doctors have said there 's a 50/50 chance the child will have @entity58			2
i hope by the time i have children there might a be a cure			1
' @entity5 's mum , @entity155 , 54 , who is the chairman of the charity @entity156 @entity64 , says she is proud of her daughter 's positive attitude			1
' she looks at what she can do and what she 's achieved			2
she is just incredibly determined			0
she 's always been that way			2
' six years ago , researchers discovered the gene that causes fop and the compound that halts bone growth			2
at present , there is no government funding available so @entity156 @entity64 needs to raise Â£ 120,000 by the end of the year to allow this research to continue			0
professor @entity194 , an expert in @entity58 from @entity152 , said : ' fop is one of the most debilitating conditions i have to deal with			0
' essentially , sufferers become covered in an external shell of bone			1
they can become like statues			0
' isolating the gene was a fantastic breakthrough and we are now at the stage where we are looking to hold clinical trials			0
' if we can find something that works and switches the bone formation off then it is possible that we have a drug that could stop the disease spreading any further for @entity5 and other patients			1

@entity5 's neck has already *seized* up and she ca n't move arms over head
race against time for cure before she is covered in an ' external shell of bone '
' my biggest fear is it going into my legs . i do n't want to be in a wheelchair '
