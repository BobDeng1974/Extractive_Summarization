since then the @entity11 coach has had two short and troubled spells as a manager at @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity16 in the @entity17			0

partnership : @entity1 assisted sir @entity5 during a period of great success at @entity3 ' i spent 12 years at what is a fantastic club and never left @entity3 because i fell out with anyone there			1
