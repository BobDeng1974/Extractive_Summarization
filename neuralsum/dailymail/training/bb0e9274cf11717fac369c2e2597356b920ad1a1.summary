@entity1 captain @entity0 is hoping @entity3 's quest for multiple trophies trips them up when the sides meet on saturday			1
the @entity7 champions visit the @entity8 just three days before an important @entity10 assignment against @entity11 and three after thrashing @entity12 wednesday 7 - 0 in the @entity13			1
while many of the champions ' top - flight rivals used the midweek cup fixtures to rotate their squad , @entity14 used nine of the players who had drawn with @entity22 last sunday			1
@entity0 is hoping @entity1 can spring a surprise on @entity3 due to their tight schedule and @entity0 , whose side go in as heavy underdogs despite home advantage , hopes @entity3 's divided focus counts against them on this occasion			1
' @entity3 have got such strength in depth so to see some of the players they used in the cup surprised me , they must really want to win that competition , ' said @entity0 , who is a club ambassador for the @entity38			1
' when i saw they had won 7 - 0 that was pretty shocking but i 'm hoping that come the weekend they 've burnt their legs out a little bit			0
@entity0 tussles with @entity46 's @entity45 during the @entity7 encounter which ended in a draw ' they 're also looking forward to a @entity10 game next week that they will feel they have to win and hopefully they might just take their eyes off the ball a little bit and if so we might be able to take advantage			1
' despite the mitigating factor of the fixture list , @entity0 knows he will be coming up against opponents who are highly likely to be fighting for the title at the end of the season and will arrive in @entity65 with a confidence to match			2
but it is a challenge he has no intention of shirking			0
@entity1 's @entity0 tries to keep @entity69 at bay during their monday night clash with @entity72 ' we 're @entity1 , they 're @entity3 ... you have to be honest , the onus is on them to do well , ' he said			1
' the onus will be on them to win every game and anything we can do to upset the apple cart is good for us			0
' anyone who wants to play in the @entity7 should want to play against these players			2
if not you may as well stay in the @entity86 or @entity87 , wherever			0
' you come to the top level to test yourself against the best and there 's not many better than @entity3 , with the ( @entity91 ) @entity90 and ( @entity92 ) @entity93 of this world			2
' it 's going to be difficult , you can never get away from that , but you have to thrive on that fact			2
' @entity1 could have hoped for easier opponents as they attempt to solve defensive problems that have seen them throw away winning positions four times this season , including each of the last three three matches			0
it may be too much to ask for a shutout this time around , but @entity0 is still expecting a significant improvement			2
' i ca n't put my finger on what it is but for me as a centre - half it 's very frustrating , ' he said			0
' last year we worked on solid bases , keeping clean sheets and nicked a few 1 - 0s , but this year we 're getting the required goals but we ca n't keep the clean sheets			0
' we need to work on it as a back four and as a team because it 's not good enough really			0
' : : @entity1 's charity partners for the 2014/15 season are the @entity38			0
@entity1 players will wear the organisation 's t - shirts in the pre-match warm - up against @entity3 .			1
