@entity90 of @entity91 is currently constructing the replica as a patriotic educational tool that will also get students doing more exercise , according to the @entity16			0
the ' @entity96 ' will act as a walkway that connects the university 's two sites , covering a distance of 1.6 kilometres – more than 13,000 times shorter than the original			0
