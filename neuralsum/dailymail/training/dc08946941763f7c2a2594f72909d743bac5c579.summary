@entity0 avoids all eye contact			1
her gaze alternates between boring into the ground and scouring the horizon out the window			2
her right foot taps nervously on the wooden floor			2
she is one of the 55 female trafficking victims helped each year at the crisis intervention centre run by the @entity11 and the @entity12 in the @entity14 capital , @entity15			1
' a childhood friend told me she worked in a boutique in @entity20 and could help me get a similar job , ' she explains			2
' she put me in touch with a guy who arranged my trip to @entity25 [ in @entity26 ] and onward from @entity27 to @entity20			2
haunted : one of the women currently being helped by in the @entity30 's @entity15 anti-trafficking centre ' in @entity20 i was met by a @entity32 speaking woman , @entity31 , who took me to a flat with six other girls from @entity34			1
' @entity31 told me i ’d been sold and took my passport away			2
i refused to see clients and as a result , was denied food			2
my cries and pleas were met with blows and kicks			1
' appalling though it is , @entity0 is by no means alone			2
she 's just one of an estimated 800,000 women and children tricked and trafficked into a life of beatings , rape and torture every year			1
in @entity14 , the country that she - and i - once called home , human trafficking is a huge problem , with an estimated 25,000 @entity14 trafficked abroad in 2008 according to @entity14 ’s national @entity56			1
men are taken to work on building sites and farms , while women like @entity0 are mostly sold into the sex trade in @entity62 , @entity32 , @entity63 , the @entity64 , and elsewhere			2
tragic : @entity0 is just one of an estimated 800,000 women sold into sex slavery abroad each year hell : many of those taken abroad suffer extreme violence and are beaten and raped by their ' owners ' speaking out : @entity75 's new novel @entity73 focuses on trafficking victims can be as young as 12 - years - old , with the @entity11 estimating that 10 per cent of the @entity14 taken are children			1
i met @entity0 while researching my novel , @entity73 , which follows two friends as they attempt to save a third from the trafficking gangs still common in @entity34			1
shockingly , many of the women i spoke to had been sold into prostitution by people they knew and told me that many of recruiters were women			2
some of the girls did n't even think of themselves as victims : having previously been abused by family members , they considered violence to be normal			1
one girl who certainly thought that way was @entity96 , a girl brutalised and left pregnant by her violent father before being trafficked to @entity62			1
‘ there is nothing extraordinary or unusual about my story			2
or i do n’t think so , ' she told me			2
' like many other families in @entity14 , ours was very poor – so poor we fed our dog dried corn			1
' after my mother died of breast cancer and father went to prison for raping me , i was left alone and pregnant			0
' my godmother offered to help with the abortion and arranged for me to go to @entity62			0
" the conditions are much better there and they ’ll look after you , " she told me			0
' at the airport in @entity118 i was met by two men who drove me to a property where there were three other girls , @entity14 and @entity26 , and told me i was to serve their clients			1
' i told them i was pregnant but the men raped me in the next room that same day			0
' frightening : most of the women and children trafficked endure months if not years of torture before rescue for rural girls like @entity96 , high unemployment , widespread domestic violence and rife alcoholism further exacerbate the problem and make them more vulnerable to human trafficking than their city dwelling counterparts			1
over half the victims i met were from the @entity14 countryside , where a patriarchal mentality and religious traditions still uphold discrimination against women			1
the recruiters exploit the fact that these people are less knowledgeable about the process and risks of moving abroad for work , and as in @entity96 's case , tell them they 'll be well treated when , in fact , the reality is quite different			0
although many do eventually escape their captors , the impact of being forced into slavery can have severe emotional consequences as @entity0 makes plain			0
' locked up and under constant security , i saw no way out , ' she continues			0
' weak from starvation and abuse , i agreed to seeing clients			0
' there was no choice but work the streets and nightclubs every day , sometimes serving up to a dozen men or even more			0
risk : those who live in rural areas are more at risk because of economic problems and poverty @entity75 's new novel , @entity73 , is out now and available from @entity178 ' my captors took all the money on the pretext i owed them for flights and accommodation			1
the security guy who drove me everywhere raped me every time i refused his advances , which was almost daily			0
' my bruises and cuts were habitually covered with cheap make - up			0
after a few weeks i managed to use the phone of one of my clients and called a friend i knew in @entity20			0
' she helped me run away and report my circumstances to a charity organisation there			0
i was promptly returned to @entity14			1
' others , such as @entity96 , find ways to adapt - even if that means overcoming repeatedly being raped when dealing with the aftermath of an abortion			0
' i cried and pleaded them to spare me the ordeal [ of being prostituted ] but was told they had paid good money for me , which i had to return , ' continues @entity96			0
' i was driven to various hotels and houses to see men for two weeks before i had the abortion			0
days after , i was taken to see clients again			0
' it was dreadful at the beginning and i was frightened			0
but the living conditions there were a lot better than at home and they gave us plenty of food too			0
' i worked in @entity62 for a year before we were arrested following a police raid and sent back to @entity14 and @entity26 , penniless			1
' although for @entity96 and @entity0 the nightmare is , for now at least , over , while poverty and unemployment in @entity14 remain rampant , the problem is likely to continue			1
warning girls of the risks abroad is not enough			0
viable alternatives such as skills training , employment opportunities and investment in human potential , needs to be more widely available			0
otherwise , regardless of the potential risks , men , women and children will continue to be trafficked out of @entity14			1
@entity237 , as much as desperation , is what sends them abroad			0
@entity75 is the author of @entity73 ( £ 8.99 , @entity240 ) , available now at @entity178			1
