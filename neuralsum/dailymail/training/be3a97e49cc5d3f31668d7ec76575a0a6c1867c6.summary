by @entity0 for the @entity1 defiant : @entity2 continued to back his ' fantasy ' scheme and attacked the civil servants who dismissed it from an official shortlist @entity2 caused dismay in @entity10 ranks yesterday by pressing on with his island airport plan			1
vowing to fight any expansion of @entity15 , the mayor of @entity13 said his @entity17 estuary vision was not dead despite it being ditched from an official shortlist			1
sir @entity19 , the airports commissioner , said the £ 100billion scheme was not a credible option because of the cost and risks involved			0
three options remain on the table – two rival plans for a third runway at @entity15 , and one for a second runway at @entity29			1
mr @entity2 said sir @entity19 ’s ‘ myopic ’ decision was ‘ a giant smokescreen ’ for a u-turn by civil servants who favour @entity15 expansion			1
and he demanded that @entity36 and @entity37 stick to a conservative manifesto pledge to block a third runway in west @entity13			0
he said : ‘ we should n’t be contracting out this decision to distinguished former civil servants , no matter how eminent they are			0
this is a political decision			0
‘ @entity29 is not a long - term solution , ’ he said , adding that @entity15 would ‘ create unbelievable levels of noise , blight and pollution ’			1
the prime minister will be spared an immediate row because sir @entity19 ’s final recommendation will not be announced until just after the general election in may 2015			0
it will now be at least 2025 before a third runway at @entity15 could be operational – allowing rival airports in @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 to steal a march			2
a further complication is that mr @entity2 , who is said to harbour prime ministerial ambitions , is seeking the safe @entity10 seat of @entity62 and @entity63			2
opinion in the constituency , which borders @entity15 , is divided between those who depend on the airport for their livelihood and those worried about more noise			1
responding to the mayor ’s attack , sir @entity19 said : ‘ i wish i had his speechwriter			0
i am not sure that this kind of colourful prose takes us very much further forward			0
‘ we are not persuaded that a very large airport in the @entity17 is the right answer to @entity13 ’s and the @entity80 ’s connectivity needs			1
the economic disruption would be huge and there are environmental hurdles which it may prove impossible or very time consuming to surmount			0
plans : one of the options is to build a second runway at @entity29 , pictured ‘ even the least ambitious version of the scheme would cost £ 70billion to £ 90billion with much greater public expenditure involved than in other options – probably some £ 30billion to £ 60billion in total			2
’ the remaining @entity15 and @entity29 options were shortlisted by his commission last december			2
but sir @entity19 , who is the former head of the @entity96 , had wanted more time to decide whether the estuary plan should join them			0
@entity99 , @entity100 ’s transport spokesman , said the decision ended the mayor ’s ‘ back - of - a - fag - packet ’ scheme : ‘ @entity2 ’s fantasy island airport plan , which would have closed @entity15 and caused longer passenger journeys , has finally been dashed			1

@entity2 stood by his plan to build new airport in @entity17
said he would oppose expansion of @entity15 because of noise and pollution
*sensitive* issue as @entity2 *standing* as mp in constituency by @entity15
however his plan was described as an ill - thought - out ' fantasy ' by @entity100
