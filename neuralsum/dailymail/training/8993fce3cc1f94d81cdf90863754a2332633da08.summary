by @entity1 reporter published : 04:39 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 22 august 2013 a star 's twinkling could help uncover the sizes and gravity of the hundreds of exoplanets			2
a team of astronomers at the @entity9 in @entity10 have said the flickering can give up a host of secrets of its orbiting planets			1
hundreds of ‘ exoplanets ’ outside our solar system have been identified in the last 20 years but estimates of their size could be 200 per cent out			2
sky at night : scientists have revealed studying a star 's flickering can give up a host of secrets including the strength of gravity at its surface and the sizes of its orbiting planets the team at @entity9 however has now developed a new technique of studying the star 's flickering to calculate its surface gravity which could cut the previous uncertainties in half - and show if they could be rocky like @entity38 or gaseous and uninhabitable like @entity39			1
professor @entity40 , who led the team of astronomers , said : ' once you know a star ’s surface gravity then you only need one other measurement , its temperature , which is pretty easy to obtain , to determine its mass , size and other important physical properties			1
' researchers showed variations on a timescale of hours in a star ’s brightness are associated with its surface gravity			1
the findings published in @entity59 are based on observations by the @entity61 and offer a simple new way of determining a basic stellar property that has previously been difficult to measure accurately			0
optical brightness variations allow a calculation of the surface gravity of @entity68 - like stars with a precision of better than 25 per cent - a dramatic improvement on other techniques			1
brightness variations of @entity68 - like stars are driven by many factors including granulation - the network of small cells that cover the surface of a star that are caused by columns of gas rising from the interior			2
the @entity68 : brightness variations of @entity68 - like stars are driven by many factors including granulation on stars with high surface gravity , the granulation is finer and flickers at a higher frequency			1
on stars with low surface gravity , the granulation is coarser and they flicker at a lower frequency			1
rising hot gases and descending cool gas create hot and cold patches that flicker - twinkling light that is detected by @entity61			0
scientists can turn the light into ‘ sound ’ , with almost no ‘ hiss ’ denoting a small ‘ dwarf ’ @entity97 of hiss meanwhile would indicate a huge ' red giant '			0
' once you know a star ’s surface gravity then you only need one other measurement , its temperature , which is pretty easy to obtain , to determine its mass , size and other important physical properties ' - professor @entity40 professor @entity110 , of @entity111 in @entity111 , said : ' measuring stellar surface gravities well has always been a difficult business			1
' so it ’s is a very pleasant surprise to find the subtle flickering of a star ’s light provides a relatively easy way to do it			2
' @entity120 , the program director at the @entity121 in the @entity122 which funded the research , said : ' this actually could be the breakthrough we ’ve needed to pin down the sizes of hundreds more stars and exoplanets			0
' getting accurate sizes is critical to measuring exoplanet density which has been a missing puzzle piece for so many planets			0
' so - in addition to having implications for stellar evolution - this innovative work will be invaluable for identifying hundreds of exoplanets as either rocky or gaseous			0
' prof @entity137 , of @entity138 in @entity139 , reviewed the study for the journal and described it as ' highly satisfying ' given the wording of the old nursery rhyme			0
he said : ' studying the twinkling of stars does indeed help us to understand what they are			0

astronomers at @entity9 say flickering gives up host of secrets
they claim it can reveal strength of gravity at its surface
also reveals size of orbiting planets and therefore chances of life
