@entity1 scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos for the first time			1

some scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren			1
@entity1 scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos , like the one above , for the first time in history			1
the announcement confirms rumors that some researchers have been conducting ethically questionable experiments the team tried to tweak the gene responsible for β - thalassaemia , a potentially deadly blood disorder , using a germ line editing technique known as @entity30 / @entity29			1
@entity30 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code			1
unlike other gene - silencing tools , the @entity30 system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level			1
the dna cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally , for instance after chronic sun exposure			0
but unlike uv rays that can result in genetic alterations , the @entity30 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome			0
when cellular machinery repairs the dna break , it removes a small snip of @entity40			0
in this way , researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome			1
the team studied the ability of the @entity30 / @entity29 system to edit the gene called @entity63 responsible for β - thalassaemia however , others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers			1
researchers at @entity72 in @entity73 have today published their research in the journal @entity76 , according to a report in @entity78			1
in the paper , researchers led by @entity80 , attempted to downplay concerns by using ' non-viable ' embryos , which ca n't develop into babies			2
the team tried to tweak the gene responsible for β - thalassaemia , a potentially deadly blood disorder , using a germ line editing technique known as @entity30 / @entity29			1
but the researchers involved said that their results revealed ' serious obstacles ' in using the technique on human embryos			1

@entity80 's group studied the ability of the @entity30 / @entity29 system to edit the gene called @entity63			1
the team injected 86 embryos and then waited two days for the @entity30 technique to work			2
nature reports that of the 71 embryos that survived , 54 were genetically tested			0
the tests found that 28 were successfully spliced , but only a few contained the replacement genetic material			0
' if you want to do it in normal embryos , you need to be close to 100 per cent , ' @entity80 told nature			0
' that 's why we stopped			0
we still think it 's too immature			0
' @entity143 genetic editing alters the dna in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin , muscle , nerves , bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases			2
modifying the dna of human embryos so that @entity40 changes are preserved in the germ line - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations			1
improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near ' 100 per cent efficiency ' in trials using mice , a leading scientist has warned			1
dr @entity173 , a geneticist at the @entity176 , said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children			0
the warning follows a breakthrough last april in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living , adult mice using the @entity30 - @entity29 gene editing technique			1
the @entity30 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies			1
' we used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut , ' dr @entity192 told @entity198 at the @entity199			0
' it 's a case of ' you shoot you score ' ... on the human side , one has to be very cautious			0
' unlike other gene - silencing tools , the @entity30 system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level			2
such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the @entity212 , but is permitted in the @entity213 and @entity1			1
a number of other groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos			0
@entity219 , from @entity220 in @entity1 has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals			1
professor @entity227 , a geneticist at @entity228 is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos			0
dr @entity231 , a scientist with @entity233 's group , recently outlined proposals to edit the human germline in an interview with @entity237			0
she proposed using immature egg cells from the ovaries taken from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer			0
the immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a gene - editing technique known as @entity30 would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer			1
however , the project is not thought to be underway yet and it is not known if it has been approved			0
dr @entity248 , however , has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in @entity1			1
@entity212 and @entity213 scientists have already expressed concerns over the ethics of the latest experiment , with one doctor calling for the research to be banned			1
dr @entity256 , from watchdog @entity257 , said : ‘ this news emphasises the need for an immediate global ban on the creation of genetically modified designer babies			2
‘ it is critical that we avoid a eugenic future			0
if @entity1 does not want to get the reputation of being the wild west of the new eugenics it must join the many countries – including the @entity212 – which would ban such research			1
' dr @entity272 , a stem cell biologist at @entity228 , said the experiment poses a ‘ cautionary tale ’			0
he said : ‘ their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing			2
’ professor @entity282 , an expert in cancer genetics at @entity284 , said : ‘ this is a significant departure from currently accepted research practice			2
can we be certain that the embryos were indeed non-viable ? ‘ the fact that there were a number of “ off - target ” mutations is clearly a worry			0
’ many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren while genetic modification of human embryos is illegal in the @entity212 , the historic decision was taken in february to allow ‘ three - parent babies ’			1
this legalised the donor replacement of mitochondrial dna – the so - called batteries which power the body ’s cells			2
although the procedure has its critics , it would not alter the genetic characteristics of a child , unlike the @entity1 experiment			1
@entity319 , from @entity320 which supports families with genetic conditions , said patients would be interested to hear about the @entity1 experiment – but undoubtedly would be aware that ‘ ethical challenges will need to be resolved ’			1
a dna technique which allows scientists to tell the difference between identical twins has been discovered			1
with dna profiling , police can identify a suspect with a strand of hair or a drop of blood – but it falls apart with twins , who share 100 per cent of their genes			2
but researchers at the @entity339 claim they can now distinguish between the two			2
as twins grow their different life experiences create a variation in the hydrogen bonds within their dna			2
this could be caused by such things as smoking , sunshine , exposure to chemicals or diet			0
dr @entity352 , who leads the @entity353 at @entity354 , has created a method of heating dna until the hydrogen bonds break – identifying minute differences between twins			0
he said : ‘ we have demonstrated substantial progress towards a test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work			0
’ last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in @entity1			1
@entity371 , chairman of the @entity372 in @entity373 , and four colleagues , wrote in the journal nature that such research could harm other areas of science by provoking a public outcry			2
they wrote : ' it is thought that studies involving the use of genome - editing tools to modify the dna of human embryos will be published shortly			0
' in our view , genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations			0
' this makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable			1
' such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications			0
' we are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development , namely making genetic changes that can not be inherited			0
' at this early stage , scientists should agree not to modify the dna of human reproductive cells			0
' their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create ' designer families ' where certain traits are selected for			1
in reality such selection can be difficult as often there is no single gene that provides a single trait and many genes have multiple functions .			0

@entity1 scientists tried to tweak gene responsible for a blood disorder
leading researchers have called for a halt on such research until the *implications* and *safety* of the technology can be properly explored
they warn germ line modification is ' dangerous and ethically unacceptable '
some fear the technique could be misused to create ' designer families '
