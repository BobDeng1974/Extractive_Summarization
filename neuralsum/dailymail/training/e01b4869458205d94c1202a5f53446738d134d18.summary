by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will not name @entity3 as their new manager until next week			1
the @entity6 club have agreed most of the details of the 62 - year - old ’s new contract at @entity10 and had hoped to officially announce the appointment on thursday			1
it is understood , however , that @entity2 have not yet managed to agree upon all the specifics with their incoming manager			0
however , with @entity25 currently preparing the @entity18 squad for a friendly on saturday , there is only so much time he can spend in conversation with his future employers at the moment			1
once @entity18 ’s friendly with @entity47 is out of the way on saturday , @entity2 hope to sit down with @entity25 again the next day			1
@entity23 meanwhile , has been offered the job as @entity25 ’s no 2 after holding talks at the @entity53 ’s penthouse apartment			1
@entity23 was seen coming out of a hotel in the seaside town of @entity32 , 20 miles southwest of @entity56 , and it is understood that the discussions took place at @entity25 ’s luxury home a few hundred yards away			2
keeping an eye on things : @entity23 made it back to @entity10 to watch the @entity65 final against @entity66 waiting game : @entity23 ( right ) was back in @entity68 to watch the @entity69 lose to @entity66 @entity25 , 62 , is said to have offered @entity23 the job as his assistant although it is unclear if the @entity2 icon has accepted yet			1
the @entity18 coach made the most of a day off from his @entity16 camp in @entity77 to return to @entity32 and meet @entity23 , having arranged the talks last week			1
@entity53 training will resume on thursday when more foreign - based players , including @entity2 striker @entity81 , join up with the squad ahead of saturday ’s warm - up game against @entity47			0
@entity25 honoured a commitment to attend a book launch in @entity56 on wednesday night but refused to answer questions about @entity2			2
@entity23 , meanwhile , flew in by private jet and was driven to the exclusive @entity88 and then to @entity25 ’s home nearby where an underground garage enabled him to arrive unseen			0
he returned to @entity68 to attend wednesday night ’s @entity6 under - 21 final between @entity2 and @entity66 at @entity10 which the @entity92 won 2 - 1			2
during their meeting , @entity25 is understood to have emphasised his commitment to playing attacking football , as well as outlining the role @entity23 would have in the new set - up			2
the 40 - year - old grew disillusioned with @entity2 ’s cautious style under @entity101 as well as his own peripheral role in the backroom team before taking charge as interim boss for the final four games of the season following the @entity109 ’s sacking			0
switch : @entity25 announced his @entity18 team will play a 5 - 3 - 2 at the @entity16 in @entity112 if he accepts the job , @entity23 will be one of two assistants to @entity25 , who prefers to have a @entity53 coach and one with close links to the club by his side , as was the case during his time in charge at @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
@entity25 is keen to draw heavily on @entity23 ’s knowledge and insight of @entity2			2
he is particularly interested in the youth academy and has already picked the former @entity130 international ’s brains over the top young players coming through at the club , as well as the senior stars who could be coming and going this summer			0
in his last home game in charge , it was notable that @entity23 gave senior debuts to @entity138 , 18 , and 20 - year - old @entity139			0
the identity of his other , @entity53 , assistant remains unclear however			0
@entity25 has not offered @entity142 the job and @entity144 , @entity2 ’s first - team coach under sir @entity145 , remains a possibility			0
@entity147 is almost certain to join @entity25 at @entity2 as goalkeeper coach along with video analyst @entity149			0
the new management will have a major rebuilding job on their hands after a dismal season at @entity10 descended into bickering and acrimony among the players			0
different directions : @entity159 ( left ) will be cut from the coaching staff , though he has n't been told formally , while @entity161 will have a meeting on thursday to discuss his future role at the club bearer : @entity2 chief @entity166 broke the news to @entity159 in the dressing room after sunday 's game			1

@entity2 have yet to agree upon all terms with @entity3
the @entity10 club hoped to announce the appointment on thursday
@entity2 hope to sit down with @entity25 on sunday after @entity18 's friendly
@entity25 will offer @entity23 the no 2 role at the @entity10 club
the pair have held *crunch* talks about the @entity2 legend 's future
