it was n’t a good day for @entity2 ’s @entity1 if he wanted to prove his new club manger @entity3 wrong			1
or @entity4 if he wanted bragging rights at @entity8 ’s training ground next season over @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			2
there were 10 @entity14 players on show in @entity17 's 1 - 0 win against @entity18 in this @entity20 quarter - final in @entity21 – eight for the losers			1
and it was n’t their finest hour			0
mercilessly criticised for his performances at @entity37 and already seemingly written off by @entity3 , @entity1 was led a merry dance by @entity39 as he started in a holding midfield role			0
the lame attempts to stop the little maestro in the build - up to @entity29 ’s eight - minute goal were as lethargic as @entity45 would recall from last season			0
in fact , his brightest moment came when he did n’t need to use his feet – stretching his 6ft4ins frame after an hour to head @entity52 ’s cross over the bar			0
and predictably , he was also accused of leaving his elbow where he should n’t when pushed further forward , this time into the back of the head of @entity17 defender @entity57			2
on other occasions , he was penalised for handball and offside			0
but it would be unfair to single out @entity1 as the sole scapegoat as @entity18 saved the biggest stage for their worst performance of the tournament			2
all alone : @entity18 's @entity67 controls the ball on his chest but he struggled and was substituted out of place : @entity71 's @entity52 ( left ) struggled at left back for @entity18 @entity2 : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity8 's @entity9 ( right ) struggled to get going low point : @entity74 goalkeeper @entity73 lost his first match in 21 for @entity18 the normally - dependable @entity4 was unreliable			1
he was wrongfooted by @entity29 as the striker shot @entity17 in front			2
even more embarrassingly , @entity4 was nutmegged by the same player in the second half as if in the school playground			0
@entity52 looked largely what he was – a centre - back filling in on the left			1
@entity74 ’s @entity67 did n’t live up to his billing and was replaced by @entity71 ’s @entity85			1
@entity86 was hooked and replacement @entity87 could n’t force an equaliser			0
in goal , @entity74 ’s @entity92 tasted defeat for the first time in 21 matches for his @entity97 the flipside , @entity17 ’s @entity91 - based players enjoyed the day much better ; @entity8 duo @entity9 and @entity10 and team - mate @entity11 , who watched from the bench			1
of course the @entity14 @entity33 will feel deflated today but at least they appeared in a @entity20 quarter - final – unlike @entity101			0
miss : @entity74 striker @entity87 came on as a substitute for @entity18 but squandered a great chance ineffective : @entity71 midfielder @entity85 came on as a substitute but was largely anonymous off : @entity106 's @entity86 ( left ) was substituted after failing to impress for @entity18			1

@entity29 opened the scoring after just eight minutes for @entity17
@entity1 continued the *dreadful* form he showed for @entity2
@entity74 keeper @entity73 lost for first time in 21 games for @entity18
team - mate @entity67 substituted as he struggled to find form
@entity8 's @entity4 could not deal with @entity29
@entity71 's @entity52 looked out of position at full back
