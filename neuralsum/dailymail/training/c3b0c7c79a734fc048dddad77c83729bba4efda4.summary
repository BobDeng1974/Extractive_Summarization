@entity3 @entity2 clerics are willing to carry out sharia marriages involving child brides as young as 12 , an investigation has found			1
two imams said they would be prepared to officiate at the wedding of an underage girl to a man in his twenties , despite fears the pair would later have sex			1
the revelations have led the @entity15 to confirm that such ceremonies will be examined in the government ’s forthcoming @entity17 to outlaw forced marriages			1
secret marriages : some muslim religious leaders consent to marry a girl of 12 if she consents - and her parents keep it a secret ( stock image ) child bride : an imam at the @entity29 in @entity30 agreed to the marriage of a 12 - year - old girl - but only if she consented to the nuptials more than 1,000 of the 8,000 forced marriages of @entity3 each year are believed to involve girls of 15 or under , with one case last year allegedly involving a girl of five			1
the clerics were approached by man posing as the father of a 12 - year - old who wanted her to marry to prevent her being tempted into a decadent @entity43 lifestyle			2
@entity44 , of the @entity29 in @entity30 , stressed the need for secrecy with such a ceremony			0
he allegedly said : ‘ if it ( the marriage ) was not possible , i would have told you straight away ... i would love the girl to go to her husband ’s houses ( sic ) as soon as possible , the younger the better			2
‘ under sharia ( @entity2 law ) there is no problem			0
it is said she should see her first sign of puberty at the house of her husband			0
‘ the problem is that we can not explain such things ( the marriage ) if the girl went tomorrow ( to the authorities )			2
‘ the other thing is the underage thing and if tomorrow the girl is , let ’s say coerced or forced into this , and she goes and reports it to the police then she will put all of us into the problems			1
’ campaigners argue that children ca n't decide whether they want to be married ( posed by model ) he also urged the father to encourage the newlyweds to ‘ delay the togetherness ’ , meaning postpone having sex			0
@entity86 , a retired imam who still officiates at weddings at @entity89 mosque , @entity90 , reportedly agreed to carry out the ceremony after evening prayers on wednesday			0
‘ tell people it is an engagement but it will be a marriage , ’ he told an undercover @entity94 reporter			0
‘ in @entity2 , once the girl reaches puberty the father has the right , the parents have the right , but under the laws of this country if the girl complains and says her marriage has been arranged and she was n’t of marriageable age , then the person who performed the marriage will be jailed as well as the mother and father			2
’ he explained how the @entity111 had married a seven - year - old girl before adding : ‘ we are his followers , and that is what you have to explain ( to your daughter )			1
’ it is not illegal for clerics to perform @entity2 marriages , even when one or both of those marrying are under 16			2
such marriages are not recognised in @entity3 law , so civil formalities can take place only if both are over 16			1
islamic law allows a couple to have sex after marriage but , as the legal age of consent is 16 , a husband can be prosecuted for rape if he has sex with an underage girl			1
secret : another retired @entity139 - who worships at the @entity140 in east @entity90 - was happy to marry a 12 - year - old girl but only if her parents told no - one about it the @entity144 , set up in 2005 , dealt with 1,468 cases last year with 205 involving children under the age of 15			1
@entity148 , of the @entity149 , said : ‘ we are strongly opposed to it on the basis that it is illegal under the law of the land where we are living and even under sharia it is highly debatable			0
’ after being confronted , @entity44 said he would not have performed the marriage without the girl ’s consent and would have sought legal advice			0
the @entity15 said : ‘ child marriage is totally unacceptable and illegal			0
perceived cultural sensitivities and political correctness can not and will not get in the way of preventing and uncovering such abuse			0
