by @entity0 tucked away under a grassy hill , at first glance this incredible subterranean house could have stepped off the pages of @entity5 , but look a little closer and rather than @entity7 's quaint cosy cottage it in fact bears more resemblance to a @entity13 villain 's underground lair			0
dubbed @entity14 - a name which somewhat betrays its state of the art design - the £ 2.5million home in @entity18 , @entity19 , took 18 months to build with developers having to excavate 5,000 tons of soil before work could get underway			1
the one - of - a - kind dwelling has four bedrooms , all of which are en - suite , a huge living room , dining room and kitchen , a cinema and a central courtyard			2
and all of this is hidden hidden below ground level - with the developers behind the brand - new home given the strict task of building a property out of sight of the neighbours			0
underground : tucked away under a grassy hill , at first glance this incredible subterranean house in @entity18 , @entity19 , could have stepped off the pages of @entity5 modern : look a little closer and rather than @entity7 's quaint cosy cottage it in fact bears more resemblance to a @entity13 villain 's state - of - the art underground lair all mod cons : the one - of - a - kind dwelling has four bedrooms , all of which are en - suite , a huge living room , dining room and kitchen , a cinema and a central courtyard secret : most of the home is hidden hidden below ground level - with the developers behind the brand - new home given the strict task of building a property out of sight of the neighbours lighten up : to keep natural daylight , the house has a 45 - foot long south facing expanse of glass which serves the kitchen , dining and living areas , opening onto a sunken courtyard unique : the home , which was recently finished , has been put up for sale for £ 2.5 million with estate agents @entity79 describing it as ' stylish and unique underground home ' amazing : ' it is the most amazing and unique house which i have had the pleasure of selling , ' said @entity86 , from @entity79 view from below : ' even though it is underground , the amount of light it unbelievable , ' said ms @entity86			1
' there is a lovely courtyard which acts as a suntrap ' out to impress : ms trybus said the house would be ideal for a professional footballer , or a celebrity who is looking for something architecturally impressive night in : homeowners would not need to pop to the nearest multiplex to catch a movie as the house has its own cinema , complete with a nine - foot screen cooking up a storm : the home has programmable lighting , solar panels and a state - of - the - art heat recovery and ventilation system , while amateur chefs would love the bespoke @entity114 kitchen entrance : an oak front door opens into the hall with contemporary cloakroom			1
the main reception room and kitchen have sliding doors to a lit courtyard floor plan : the rooms of the luxury home are positioned around the central courtyard and there is a large open plan kitchen and living area in process : @entity14 was built using a waterproof reinforced concrete box set into the hill			0
the roof was then turfed over , to create the garden wasteland : the site in @entity18 before work began on the incredible property , which took a year and a half to complete			0

developers had to excavate 5,000 tons of soil to build the state - of - the art property in @entity143 , @entity19
