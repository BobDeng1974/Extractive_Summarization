@entity0 are considering stumping up the staggering £ 60million @entity1 want for @entity2			1
@entity3 , who had @entity2 as a scholar , want to re-sign him – but not at that price			2
however , @entity0 see the 21 - year - old @entity8 international as a good investment , not least because his @entity11 academy status , just like @entity12 , helps the club conform to @entity14 ’s @entity15 rules			1
@entity17 : @entity2 's impressive performances for @entity8 and @entity1 have caught @entity0 's attention expensive : @entity1 are asking for £ 60m for the talented young midfielder but @entity0 are willing to pay @entity2 has been impressive during @entity8 ’s run to the last 16 of the @entity22 in @entity23 where they take on @entity24 in @entity25 on monday			1
the midfielder left @entity26 for @entity27 under a cloud two years ago , firing a parting shot at sir @entity30			0
speaking to @entity31 last year , he said : ‘ it was all down to @entity30			0
i did n’t want to sign a contract as @entity30 did n’t play me , even though there were no midfielders there			0
' he obviously thought i did n’t deserve the contract i asked for and did n’t put me in the team even though he had no midfield players , it was his choice			0
’ @entity2 scored five goals in his first campaign with the @entity46 giants and followed that up with nine last season as @entity1 won the @entity50 title			2
value : @entity0 consider @entity2 to be a strong investment because he trained in @entity53 with @entity3 prediction : @entity2 bought himself for @entity0 on computer game @entity55 @entity57 a great prospect - @entity58 he would add further depth to an already extensive @entity0 midfield after @entity12 ’ arrival from @entity63 for £ 30m earlier this month			1
the @entity65 international fell out with coach @entity66 in @entity23 as the world champions were embarassingly eliminated at the group stage			0
@entity12 joins the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 in the @entity76 engine room .			2

21 - year - old has impressed since joining @entity1 in 2012
@entity0 want midfielder to play *alongside* @entity12
@entity2 counts as home - grown having trained at @entity3
