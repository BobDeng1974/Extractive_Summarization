hailed a hero : @entity1 , agreed to guide @entity2 to safety over the @entity5 border , but instead directed him to an ambush in the desert colonel @entity2 ’s captured son @entity8 predicted @entity9 would slide back into conflict within weeks			1
the 39 - year - old former playboy spoke out as the country unveiled its new government last night			1
the key job of defence minister went to an obscure army commander from @entity17 – the remote mountain town where @entity8 was captured on saturday			1
leaders in the area had refused to hand over their trophy prisoner for trial unless they received a top post in the new cabinet			0
none of the cabinet positions announced last night went to prominent @entity27 , which will come as a relief to @entity30 and his @entity32 allies who helped oust @entity34			0
but the defence appointment of @entity36 from @entity17 , a town with 16,000 inhabitants , was a major surprise			0
his appointment means @entity41 , the former @entity42 inmate who plans to sue @entity43 over torture claims , has been cut out of the secularist government			0
mr @entity36 denied he won the job as a reward for catching @entity8			1
he said : ‘ it is an insult to suggest a deal was done			0
’ @entity8 remains at a secret location in custody in a private house in the town			1
in a ranting video message , he said that ‘ in a couple of months or maximum one year ’ regions that banded together to oust his family would turn on one another			0
he is wanted for war crimes by the @entity61 in @entity62 , but the @entity61 conceded he would be tried in @entity9			1
it means he will almost certainly face the death penalty if convicted			0
tribesman @entity1 yesterday claimed he forsook a million euros to betray @entity8			1
he says he was offered the cash to guide a ‘ vip ’ across the remote border into @entity5			0
guessing who his secret client was , and fearing he would be shot rather than paid , he led @entity8 straight to the @entity70			2
secret location : @entity2 , seated , shown in a released video with his @entity9 captors			2
the son of former leader @entity34 has been reportedly arguing with fighters loyal to the @entity76 injuries : the footage shows the bandages still on the thumb and two fingers of @entity8 's right hand - injuries that @entity8 claims were sustained during an allied attack in pain : the footage shows @entity8 grimacing while sitting in his chair			1
it is unclear whether he is reactive from his injuries or his general predicament mr @entity1 said he had been offered the money - the equivalent of more than 1.6million @entity94 dinar - so @entity8 and four companions could escape capture and possible execution at the hands of troops loyal to the @entity76			1
but he said : ' i was offered millions but all the money they had would not buy a pebble of our sand or one drop of our martyrs ' blood			0
' it might have also been because mr @entity1 had feared he would be killed after holding up his end of the bargain			0
mr @entity1 was speaking to reporters in @entity17 , where @entity8 is being held at a secret location before the details of his prosecution are finalised			2
the news conference came on the same day video footage was released showing @entity8 surrounded by @entity9 revolutionary fighters shortly after his capture on saturday			1
the video , allegedly taken at the @entity17 safe house , shows @entity8 arguing with his captors and admonishing them , saying the regions now united in revolution would soon turn against each other rip the country apart			1
mr @entity1 said he was hired as a guide to help @entity8 escape @entity9 but had instead contacted revolutionary fighters in the country 's south - informing them that a two - car convoy carrying the wanted man would be passing near them on the night of november 18			1
he said : ' i made @entity8 believe that i trusted him			2
' ' they were ready to execute me ' : mr @entity1 , speaking at a news conference in @entity17 , @entity9 , revealed he was offered one million euros to spirit @entity8 to safety on the night of @entity8 's , mr @entity1 said he was travelling with guards in the first car of their convoy			1
ten fighters from @entity17 , in the @entity32 mountains , and five from @entity1 's own tribe , @entity143 , were waiting at a pre-arranged section of the desert			0
the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) has appointed the local commander whose troops captured @entity2 as the nation 's new defence minister			1
@entity150 , head of the military council in @entity17 , was given the defence job as part of a cabinet line - up which has the tricky task of balancing rival regional factions and ideological camps who are jockeying for influence			2
the new government line - up - which will run the country until elections are held - was agreed at an @entity76 meeting yesterday , a council source claims			2
but , in an indication of the tensions around the cabinet composition , the source later said some @entity76 members were not happy with the final decision			0
the anonymous source said : ' there are some people who do not accept some of the names			0
' in other appointments , @entity9 's deputy envoy to the @entity176 was named as foreign minister , an oil company executive was made oil minister , and the finance minister in the outgoing government was re-appointed , the source said			1
mr @entity150 is a former officer in the @entity9 military whose forces from @entity17 also played a crucial role in the offensive on @entity187 that ended @entity2 's rule in august			1
he had not previously been seen as a contender for the defence job			0
mr @entity1 said : ' i had agreed with the fighters that the best place for the ambush would be in a part of desert that was surrounded by high ground			0
' when we arrived at the dark , deep hollow the gunfire was very precise , it only took about half a minute to capture the first car			0
' he intentionally told @entity8 's convoy to have the vehicles spaced two miles apart to give the captors time to regroup			1
he said : ' when the second car arrived , we started to shoot very precisely , to damage the vehicle so he could not escape			0
' @entity8 , dressed in a long robe and a brown head scarf wrapped around his face , jumped out of the car and tried to run into the desert , but his fate was sealed			2
it is unclear whether mr @entity1 had planned to ensnare @entity8 from the beginning , or whether he defected when he had doubts about his payment and feared that he might be @entity219 did admit : ' i 'm sure were planning to execute me when we reached the border			2
they had two handguns , two grenades , a knife and handcuffs			0
they were ready to execute me if they had any doubt			0
' i did n't ask for an advance payment or anything			0
there was no money in the car			0
this proves that he wanted to execute me at the border			0
' @entity76 fighters found about £ 3,000 in the two - car convoy			0
nevertheless fighters allied to the @entity76 who caught @entity8 refer to mr @entity1 as a ' hero '			2
mr @entity1 said he believed @entity8 hired him as a guide because he thought he was well disguised - and that perhaps because he was delusional			2
mr @entity1 said : ' @entity8 did n't think i knew it was him			2
nobody told me it was him			0
@entity8 was dreaming of leaving @entity9 and then to eventually return			1
' the commander of the fighters that conducted the ambush , @entity255 , said that on the plane after his capture , @entity8 had asked if it was mr @entity1 who tipped them off			1
the prosecutor of the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) said today that @entity9 could put @entity2 on trial at home , but that the @entity62 court 's judges must be involved in the @entity266 was in @entity187 for talks with @entity9 's new leaders about their plans for @entity8 , who is charged with crimes against humanity by the @entity61			1
@entity9 's new leaders want to see justice done in their own country , even though they have yet to set up a court system			1
mr @entity276 said : ' @entity8 is captured so we are here to ensure cooperation			1
if they [ @entity9 ] prosecute the case , we will discuss with them how to inform the judges , and they can do it ... but our judges have to be involved			1

former playboy , 39 , speaks out as country unveils new government
military commander whose troops captured @entity8 is rewarded with role as nation 's new defence minister
@entity9 can try ousted leader 's son at home , but @entity61 *insists* its judges must be involved
