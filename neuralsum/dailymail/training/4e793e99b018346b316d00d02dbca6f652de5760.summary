by @entity1 reporter published : 15:17 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 12 september 2013 @entity3 ’s richest family – the @entity4 – is using a tax loophole related to charitable giving to ensure that large chunks of their enormous wealth can be passed on tax free to their heirs			1
the dynasty behind the @entity15 retail chain has a combined wealth estimated at more than $ 150 billion and retains a 48 percent stake in the world ’s second largest publicly listed company			1
since 2003 , charitable trusts setup in the names of two deceased family members have donated more than $ 9 billion to their charitable arm - the @entity23			1
keeping it in the family : @entity26 , left , @entity27 , and @entity28 have given considerable amounts to charity but those same trusts are also helping to keep their fortune tax free for future generations however according to tax experts these massive donations will also benefit future generations of the family by ensuring that they inherit a tax free fortune			1
the world ’s largest retailer was started by @entity41 in 1950 when he opened ‘ @entity26 's 5 & 10 ’ store in @entity43 , @entity44			1
in 1953 the business was still very much in its infancy , the @entity15 brand did n’t launch til the early 1960s , but @entity41 decided to divide the business in order to avoid a potential estate tax bill			0
he have each of his four children - @entity28 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity26 - received 20 percent , while he and his wife @entity55 kept the remaining 20 percent			0
family portrait : this photograph of @entity41 , wife @entity55 and their four children @entity28 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity26 is displayed at the @entity15 museum , in @entity43 , @entity44 the world 's largest retailer : the @entity4 retain a 48 percent stake in @entity15 which is the world 's second largest publicly listed company his oldest child , @entity64 , was only nine - years - old at the time , but the unusual decision was a calculated move he revealed in his autobiography , ‘ @entity69			1
’ ‘ the best way to reduce paying estate taxes is to give your assets away before they appreciate , ’ he wrote			1
although he liked to cultivate an image as an ‘ ordinary fella , ’ @entity26 had shown great foresight about estate planning , which his family members are continuing to show today			0
the @entity23 is the richest family in the world			1
@entity41 ’s children have consistently been in the top ten of the @entity83 400 since 2001 , although @entity84 took her husband @entity53 's place after his death in 2005			0
the current @entity88 has @entity84 with a fortune of $ 36.5 billion , making her the 9th richest person in the world , @entity26 has a fortune of $ 35.2 billion and is 10th , @entity28 has $ 34.3 billion and is 11th , while @entity54 has $ 33.6 billion and is the 12th richest person in the world			2
according to court records and @entity98 filings obtained by @entity88 , the family is using a number of complex tax avoidance practices to maintain their wealth and avoid paying large inheritance taxes			1
one practice in particular relates to placing large sums of money in charitable trusts so they bypass estate tax laws			1
@entity84 , left , inherited husband @entity53 's fortune when he died in 2005 , while @entity54 , right , is an avid art collector and has established the @entity111 in their home town of @entity43 , @entity44 the @entity15 dynasty : @entity64 and @entity114 had four children , three of whom are still alive and amongst the richest people in the @entity3 the family of co-founder @entity117 has n't been included the trusts are often referred to ‘ @entity125 ’ trusts after @entity121 , the former first lady who died in 1994 and whose will requested the creation of one in her name			1
according to @entity98 data seen by @entity88 , the @entity4 are by far the biggest users of these ‘ @entity125 ’ trusts , which are increasingly being used by the very wealthy to safeguard their money			1
wealthy families held a record $ 20.9 billion in @entity125 trusts in 2011 , almost twice the amount they held in 2000			1
although it can be claimed that the money put into ‘ @entity125 ’ trusts is ostensibly for charity , they have another desirable feature and if the assets appreciate substantially over the years , then they can pass money tax free to heirs			1
because assets must be locked up for several decades , such trusts are attractive only to the wealthiest families			0
‘ you have to be someone who ’s willing to say , “ i do n’t need this extra money , ’ ” @entity143 , a principal at @entity144 told @entity88			0
“ ‘ at the same time , we hope to shift it down a generation , without tax			0
’ ” three cheers : @entity26 ( left ) , @entity27 and @entity153 @entity28 recite the @entity15 cheer at the annual shareholders meeting in @entity156 , @entity44 on june 7 , 2013 the @entity23 ’s main charitable arm - the @entity23 - is funded mostly through 21 of these trusts			1
@entity114 established 16 such trusts before her death in 2007 , while the other five trusts are in the name of her son @entity53 , who died in an ultra-light plane crash in 2005			0
the 21 trusts hold more than $ 9 billion , some of which has been used to help pay for @entity23 projects such as the @entity111 in @entity43			1
it was opened by @entity27 , 63 , in 2011 and houses her art collection in a wooded ravine next to her childhood home			0
she is a former money manager who founded and ran her own financial firm , @entity173 , and now lives on a ranch in @entity175 known as the @entity176 , where she raises award - winning cutting horses and collects art. @entity54 has spent as much as $ 35 million on some of the art work in the gallery			0
@entity15 heiress @entity27 founded @entity111 in 2011 in a wooded ravine next to her childhood home , it has been bankrolled by more than $ 1 billion in donations from her family @entity15 workers protesting for better jobs and higher wages marching in @entity189 last thursday bankrolled by more than $ 1 billion in donations from her family , the gallery has attracted tourists to the local area and provided jobs , but is also help to preserve the family ’s fortune for generations to come			1
the @entity4 ’ example highlights how billionaires – and their accountants – can deftly bypass estate laws intended to ensure that the nation ’s wealthiest contribute their fair share to government as well as provide for their heirs			1
last year only $ 14 billion was raised through estate and gift taxes			2
that equates to just one percent of the $ 1.2 trillion passed down in @entity3 each year			2
‘ i hate to say it , but the very rich pay very little in gift and estate tax , ’ said @entity208 , a lawyer at @entity209 who reviewed some of the @entity23 ’s trust filings for @entity88			2
‘ at the @entity4 ’ numbers , the savings are unbelievable			0
’ a family spokesman , @entity217 , said in a statement that ‘ any charitable or estate planning practices employed by the @entity26 family are broadly available and commonly used			0
’ the trusts are often referred to ' @entity125 ' trusts after @entity121 , the former first lady who died in 1994 a donor locks up their assets in a @entity226 ( @entity227 ) for a lengthy period of time such as 20 or 30 years			2
a set amount is then given away each year to charity			0
at the end of the time period whatever is left goes to a beneficiary - the donor ’s heirs - without any tax bill			0
the trusts are often referred to ' @entity125 ' trusts after @entity121 , the former first lady who died in 1994 and whose will requested the creation of one in her name			2
the type of @entity125 trust used by the @entity4 does n’t generate a break on income taxes , instead the potential big saving is on gift and estate taxes			1
when a donor sets one up , the @entity98 assesses how much gift or estate tax is due , based on how much of the trust ’s assets will end up benefiting charity and how much will go to heirs			2
the @entity98 makes an estimate using a formula tied to the level of @entity261 bond yields during the time when the trust is set up			0
if the trust ’s investments outperform that benchmark rate , then the extra earnings are passed on to the designated heirs free of any estate tax			2
that rate has been hovering near an all - time low since 2009 and is currently 1.4 percent			0
with a big enough spread between the actual performance and the @entity98 rate , a @entity125 trust has the potential to save so much tax that it leaves the family richer than if they had n’t given to charity			2
a trust can only save taxes if they beat that 3.6 percent rate , which they would have done at any stage over the past five years			0
the trusts returned about 14 percent a year before taxes during that period , according to a @entity88 analysis of @entity98 filings			0
that growth means the four @entity114 trusts have been accumulating assets faster than they give them away			0
as of 2011 , they held a combined $ 2 billion , up from $ 1.4 billion in 2007			2
barring a stark reversal of fortune , at least that much money will probably pass to @entity114 ’s heirs .			0

@entity3 's richest family is using a tax loophole to ensure that large chunks of their wealth can be passed on tax free to their heirs
the @entity4 have a combined wealth in excess of $ 150 billion
they use ' @entity125 ' trusts to give to charity but also to pass money on to future generations without paying estate taxes
the @entity23 benefits from 21 of these trusts to which the family has donated $ 9 billion
the foundation has given more than $ 1 billion to setup the @entity111 in @entity43 , @entity44
