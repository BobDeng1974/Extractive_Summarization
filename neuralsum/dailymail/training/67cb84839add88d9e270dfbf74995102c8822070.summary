what starts out as a serene video of the peaceful @entity3 terrain quickly takes a nose - dive in this hilarious clip			1
after taking a brand new @entity8 4 camera out to film some of the stunning canyons near @entity10 , @entity3 , the videographer got more than he bargained for			1
that helicopter attempted to zoom in on the stunning @entity13 - only to crash into the side of the rock and plummet to the ground			1
' on friday , october 10 , i received the @entity25 4 in the mail and decided to try it out in my helicopter - a @entity37 with a zenmuse @entity40 - @entity39 gimbal			1
' i drove out to @entity13 , the spire in the shot , and started flying			2
' soon after , however , the videographer lost sight of - and contact with - the helicopter			2
the @entity8 camera picks up speed as it heads towards the cliff face before disaster happens and the camera collides with the rock unfortunately , the controller lost contact with the helicopter when it flew behind a rock ' the helicopter tries to fly back to you if it loses contact - it 's a safety feature			1
' i flew it behind the rock and lost contact , and when the helicopter tried to fly back to me , it flew directly into the rock			2
' i tried to find it that night but it got too dark			0
i went the next day and could n't see it at the base of the rock , so i gave up			0
' i went up again on monday and finally found it - clear down the mountain			0
it rolled quite a way			0
' when that happened , the helicopter attempted to circle back to reestablish a connection - and crashed directly into @entity13 several days later , the camera 's owner did manage to salvage the footage , though the @entity8 was beyond repair while the @entity8 obviously still records - even after colliding with a massive rock and tumbling down the mountain - the lens was scratched , the camera cracked , and the usb charging port bent , making it impossible to ever recharge			1
the moral of the story , you may ask ? ' when you fly these @entity88 with a gimbal , you ca n't use the protective case , ' says the amateur controller			0
' and then the camera is n't protected in any way			0
' proceed with caution .			0
