and now in newly released clips from this week 's episode of @entity12 his family have once again expressed their concern for the once gregarious but now reclusive 28 - year - old			1
a former fixture on red carpets and social media , he now rarely tweets , his @entity21 contains just one post and he is rarely pictured outside his house			1
it 's a far cry from the fun loving @entity5 we were once used to seeing on our screens , when in the early series of @entity12 he would spend his days partying and larking about with his sisters			1
confident and good looking @entity5 was even filmed trying out to be a model having been encouraged to do so by @entity6			1

to see if you 're mentally stable			0
' she also said that she had never thought of their relationship as a serious boyfriend / girlfriend commitment			0
@entity5 cut a slim figure in 2012 but has since piled on the pounds , something he is said to have struggled with then last year @entity5 shocked onlookers when he decided to pull out of his own sister 's wedding			1

she added , ' i just thought , " you know what , this is my day			0
i 'm not even going to worry about it "			0
' it has been widely speculated that @entity5 's current lack of confidence comes from his weight and that he did n't attend the nuptials because he was worried about being photographed			1
over the last few years the star has piled on the pounds and in episodes of @entity12 filmed before he departed from the show he was often heard talking about his weight			1
@entity5 shocked his @entity21 followers when he posted this picture of @entity128 character from @entity129 saying that it was his sister @entity6 on several occasions he went on diets and his sisters tried to help him lose the pounds and stay away from his beloved fast food , but nothing seemed to work			1
and whilst the man himself is yet to comment on his disappearance , his family have been quite vocal about his issues			2
his elder sister @entity8 has previously revealed that she believes that @entity5 suffers from social anxiety			1
she said : ' i just feel , especially over the last year , @entity5 has become very introverted and has a kind of social anxiety			1
' he 's definitely not at his happiest place that he once was , and i know he can get to that happy place and he will			0
' we all kind of get to a place where you do n't know where to go in life or whatever , so i think it 's important for him to know that he always has people to lean on and it 's not unnatural for people to not know where to begin			0
it 's a growing process			0
' i will always be his number one supporter			0
' in a new episode of @entity162 's @entity161 ( left ) and his sister @entity6 ( right ) are seen arguing about how best to handle him @entity5 was a popular member of the @entity12 cast but he is now rarely seen on the show in clips from this week 's show the family are once again seen discussing how best to help him			1

however , @entity6 is less kind , butting into the conversation and telling her mum and @entity8 : ' now what we have to do is everyone back off			2
' she continues : ' everyone licks @entity5 's ass and does everything he says and it 's just at some point you have to give it up			2
' we all make his life so easy : " okay we 'll drive you around with a chauffeur so no one has to look at you			0
" we had a chef on standby , a trainer , we 'll send people to run out and buy you socks and underwear			0
' like this is pathetic			0
we 're not going to cater to him any more but it has to be all of us			0

' however the youngest @entity5 sibling still lives with @entity8 , who expressed her reservations			1
she said : ' so now you guys want to now have an outsider come in and ambush @entity5 and basically ambush me			2
