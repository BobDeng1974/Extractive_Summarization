the case of the ' @entity2 ' physiotherapist and her boyfriend who were accused of staging her kidnapping has taken another strange twist – a group who are claiming to be the kidnappers have demanded an apology from the police			1
@entity11 , 29 , was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on march 23 , then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents ' home			0
after her ‘ release ’ police accused them of staging the kidnapping – a claim they both strongly denied			0
now the @entity22 has received a string of anonymous emails from the apparent kidnappers in which they compare themselves to the cast of @entity28 and claim they will strike again			1
but it will be made crystal clear that the @entity41 , and you , mr. [ @entity57 , had every opportunity to stop it			0
' last week @entity61 , the spokesman for the @entity41 , said that the kidnapping of @entity33 , which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers , 40 detectives and numerous @entity67 agents , was an ' orchestrated event			0
' the letter to the @entity22 says authorities have until noon on tuesday to apologize			1
it also demands that the police make clear that neither @entity33 or her boyfriend @entity47 - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges			1
as for the main reason behind the kidnapping , they write ; ' the @entity82 kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets			0
' they then compare themselves to the cast of @entity28 , the famous caper film that starred members of the @entity91 when it premiered in 1960 and @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 in the 2001 remake			1
it is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either , also reaching out to them on march 24 with an audio file of @entity33 to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in @entity82			1
she eventually turned up in @entity105 , where both of her parents live , just a few hours later			0
this latest email , sent on saturday from a dummy account , was 9,000 words long , and detailed why the group kidnapped @entity11 , and how they went about taking her from her home			2
the group consists of three members , two with college educations , and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area			0
they claim they drilled holes in the window of @entity33 and @entity47 's home to gain entry , and then used squirt guns with ' strobe flashlights and laser pointers ' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms			1
they say they played ' calming music ' as they went about the abduction , and put monitors on @entity47 , 30 , so they could make sure he did not go to police			2
they then say they put @entity33 in the trunk of @entity47 's car and drove off with her			2
the group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of @entity33 and @entity47 's home ( above ) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take @entity33 the kidnapping , which has been called an ' orchestrated event ' by authorities , has drawn comparisons to the film @entity2 ( above ) in the end however , they claim it was a case of mistaken identity , and they did not mean to take @entity33 , thinking that someone else would be in the house			1
they say that is why they decided to drop her off in @entity105 and that they were ' horrified at what we had done			0
' as for the ransom they requested , what police believe to be a rather paltry $ 8,500 , the group said ; ' we chose $ 8,500 because it was below the $ 10,000 reporting threshold , and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law			0
' attorneys for both @entity47 and @entity33 claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email , and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth			1
@entity186 ' attorney , @entity185 , said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used ' sophisticated computer skills ' that neither they or the @entity67 could ' comprehend			2
' @entity193 , the @entity41 and the @entity67 all have yet to comment on the emails .			0

self - proclaimed kidnappers behind ' @entity198 abduction ' of @entity33 are demanding police apologize for calling the incident a hoax
in an email to the @entity22 , the group threatens that they will ' cause harm ' if @entity33 or boyfriend @entity47 face criminal charges
say police have until noon on tuesday to apologize , and also use the email to *outline* how and why they kidnapped @entity33
group of three people claim they drilled a hole in her window and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take @entity33
claim they monitored @entity47 so he would not go to police , which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours
the kidnappers also compare themselves to the cast of the film @entity28 and say taking @entity33 was just a *dry* run for *bigger* kidnappings
