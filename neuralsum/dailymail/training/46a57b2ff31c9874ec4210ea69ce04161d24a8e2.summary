@entity1 the chimpanzee may soon become a human , at least in the eyes of the law			1
a rights group sued @entity1 's owners today , in an attempt to free the 26 - year - old primate so that he can live at a sanctuary			1
the lawsuit filed by the @entity12 , is petitioning a @entity14 court to grant @entity1 ' legal personhood ' based on scientific evidence that chimpanzees have the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves			1
against his will : a nonhuman rights group sued a couple in @entity14 for illegally detaining their chimpanzee named @entity1 ( who is not pictured above ) in a cage on their trailer park and lost the case the group will also bring up precedents which granted freedom to slaves before they were emancipated and considered real people			1
' not long ago , people generally agreed that human slaves could not be legal persons , but were simple the property of their owners , ' the non-profit 's president @entity35 told @entity41			2
' we will assert , based on clear scientific evidence , that it 's time to take the next step and recognize that these non-human animals can not continue to be exploited as the property of their human owners			0
' the lawsuit also argues that @entity14 ' does not limit legal personhood to homo sapiens '			1
the group plans on bringing up two similar lawsuits to free three other @entity14 chimps			1
@entity35 and his group say that @entity1 is being held against his will in a ' small , dank , cement cage ' at his owner 's reindeer farm in @entity61 , @entity14 and if given the choice , this is not how he would chose to live			1
but his owners say that 's just not the case			0
@entity1 is one of 11 chimps that @entity68 and his wife @entity69 have taken in from abusive or neglectful homes			1
they keep the chimps at their farm temporarily so that they can find a suitable sanctuary			1
remaining with their owners : three lawsuits in @entity14 have kept chimpanzees ( similar to those above ) in the care of their owners even though an animal rights group wanted to have them placed in a sanctuary the @entity68 's have had @entity1 for a decade and are still looking for a sanctuary close enough to their other home in @entity85 , @entity86 so that they can visit him			1
' he 's actually my favorite			0
he 's so attached ot us when we get home , he 'll be so excited to see us , ' mr @entity68 said from @entity86			2
he says that @entity1 is kept in a cage that exceeds state and federal standards and is inspected yearly			2
its ' not ' small ' or ' dank ; but a large area that has a door to an outside play area			0
during the winter , @entity1 stays inside in a building heated to 70 degrees , with the walls of his quarters painted to look like a jungle			2
' the chimp has a color tv and cable , ' mr @entity68 said. , ' he watches cartoons			2
' and mr @entity68 is no rookie when it comes to chimp - keeping			0
' @entity110 got 20 years experience with chimpanzees			0
we 're not just some @entity114 on the street who just happens to have a chimpanzee			0
i 've had animals all my life			0
horses , dogs , reindeer			0
it 's not a fly - by - night operations			0

the @entity12 says that @entity1 the chimpanzee is being detained against his will in @entity61 , @entity14
@entity1 is one of 11 chimps that @entity68 and @entity132 have taken in from abusive homes over the years to be placed *permanently* at a sanctuary
the group will argue in court that chimpanzees have the mental capabilities to make their own decisions
by granting ' legal personhood ' for @entity1 , they hope to free him from the @entity68 's farm so that he can live at a sanctuary
