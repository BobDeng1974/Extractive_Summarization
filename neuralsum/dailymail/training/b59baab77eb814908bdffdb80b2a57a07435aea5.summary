@entity1 's curiosity rover has discovered a mysterious metal object emerging from rock on the surface of @entity5			1
these images were captured by a camera on @entity8 , and reveal the bizarre finger - like structure protruding from the @entity5 surface and casting a shadow on to the rock below			1
science buffs have suggested the small , shiny - looking object , which makes for an incongruous sight amid the rocks , could be composed of material less susceptible to erosion than its surroundings			2
robotic finger ? an image captured by @entity1 's @entity8 rover shows the strange metallic object protruding from the surface of the rock incongruous : the unidentified object is seen nestled on the rocky surface a report on @entity30 said the structure was likely to measure just 0.5cm or less			1
it was spotted in the picture beamed back from @entity5 , which was taken on january 30			1
pictures of the mysterious object emerged after @entity8 drilled its first hole in the surface of @entity5 , to generate dust it can analyse to detect any traces of life which may once have existed on the planet			1
pictures beamed back from the @entity5 surface showed a small hole surrounded by a pile of pulverised rock dust , which @entity1 hopes to use in sample - collection tests			1
in a statement the space agency said @entity8 used both percussion and rotation to bore about 0.8in into the @entity5 rock as a test in advance of a later full drilling to collect samples			0
searching : curiosity rover has discovered what looks like a door handle on @entity5 pulverised : @entity1 's curiosity rover drilled this 0.8in deep hole on the surface of @entity5 as a test in advance of more drilling to collect samples for analysis to see if it could ever have harboured life completion of this ' mini drill ' test was confirmed in data from @entity5 received late wednesday at @entity1 's @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73			1
mission scientists will now assess the drill cuttings around the fresh half - inch diameter hole to determine whether they are suitable for processing by the rover 's on - board lab. if they pass muster , the rover team plans to proceed with commanding the first full drilling in the coming days , @entity1 said			1
the test was performed on a patch of flat , vein - bearing rock called ' @entity86 ' , which observations suggested had once been weathered by water erosion			0
' @entity90 observations of this rock yielded indications of one or more episodes of wet environmental conditions , ' @entity1 said			0
' the team plans to use @entity8 's laboratory instruments to analyse sample powder from inside the rock to learn more about the site 's environmental history			0
' drilling for life : completion of the ' mini drill ' test was confirmed in data from @entity5 received late wednesday at @entity1 's @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 the drill is just one of 10 scientific instruments on - board @entity8 which @entity1 scientists hope to use to analyse the surface of @entity5 more closely than they have ever been able to before			1
the one - ton rover has been studying the area around the @entity113 on @entity5 to see whether it could have ever been habitable by microbial life			2
the drilling comes after scientists last month said they believe the discovery of minerals below the @entity5 's surface is the ' strongest evidence yet ' it may have supported life			1
a new study led by the @entity122 , with the @entity123 , found that all the ingredients for life were present just below the planet 's surface for much of its history			2
when meteorites strike the surface of @entity5 , they act like natural probes , bringing up rocks from far beneath the crust			0
it 's continuing mission ...			0
the one - ton curiosity rover has been studying the area around the @entity113 on @entity5 to see whether it could have ever been habitable by microbial life			0
looking at data from @entity1 's @entity140 and @entity143 's @entity142 spacecrafts , they analysed rocks and found they contain clays and minerals whose chemical make - up has been altered by water			0
with up to half of life on @entity152 consisting of simple microorganisms that live in below the surface , scientists have suggested that the same may have been true for @entity5			2
dr @entity155 , lead author and planetary geologist at the @entity122 said : ' all the ingredients were there for life , but only small single - cell organisms could have survived in those conditions			0
' but i would now be more surprised if there was never any life on @entity5 , than i would be if we did one day discover that simple life lived in that environment			0
' and if life existed then , there is a chance it could still exist now			2

images show bizarre shiny object protruding from the surface
metallic object likely to measure just 0.5cm or less
pictures beamed back from @entity5 show small hole surrounded by dust
mission scientists to assess dust to see whether it can be analysed
analysis should show whether life has ever existed on the planet
