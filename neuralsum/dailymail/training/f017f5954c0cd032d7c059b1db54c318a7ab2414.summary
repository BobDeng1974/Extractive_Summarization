it is expected that the @entity53 will be priced around the same			0
other mid-range phones on the market , including the @entity56 and @entity57 , similarly only offer @entity15 rear - facing cameras			1
while the front - facing cameras on these devices are @entity62 for the @entity56 and just vga on the @entity64 , which works out at @entity65			2

previous desire handsets , notably the most recent @entity32 , had a 4 - inch screen and @entity15 camera			1
the improved cameras on the @entity10 follow a growing trend for high resolution photography capabilities			0
the new handset runs on @entity19 @entity18 4.4 with a @entity20 6.0			1
it ¿ s powered by a @entity23 processor with @entity90 of @entity25 and has @entity26 of storage reports last week claimed @entity4 was additionally working on a smartwatch to rival @entity95 ’s @entity94 and latest @entity96 and @entity98 devices			0

@entity67 launched its @entity132 this morning with the same camera combination @entity66 , @entity67 ’s head of handsets strategy told @entity69 , this trend for an improved front - facing camera in particular is being driven in @entity29 by people who want to be able to take better selfies			1
this focus from leading smartphone firms on camera quality is a direct challenge to @entity147 ’s range of @entity64 phones , a number of which use advanced photo features as the unique selling point			0
for example , the @entity153 phablet features a @entity156 camera , while the @entity64 still leads the market with a @entity159 shooter			0
however , with the launch of @entity163 earlier this morning , the @entity161 firm is already looking at alternative markets and customers			0

it lets smartphone owners share their phone ’s processors to power research , communities and more through a dedicated app. despite the @entity4 's impressive number of meagpixels , @entity147 's @entity64 ( pictured ) still leads the market in phone photography with its @entity159 camera build-wise the desire 816 feels much more expensive than other mid-range phones			2
it has a mixture of soft and smooth textures on the sides and back , and although this may sound odd , it gives the handset quite a unique quality - and adds to the feeling of holding a premium device			0
the screen does looks unmanageable at first glance and stretching from one corner to another to open a menu feels alien			0
the display itself is sharp , noticeably so			0
even more noticeable on a device priced so low and the extra size , coupled with this sharpness does @entity4 's blinkfeed a lot of justice			0
