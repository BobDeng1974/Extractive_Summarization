let me be perfectly clear ... i did n't mean it ! @entity2 changed his rhetoric monday night , backing off from his oft - repeated promise that no @entity5 would be forced to abandon his or her health insurance under @entity8 president @entity2 told cheering throngs in @entity10 monday night that he never truly promised @entity5 could keep their health insurance plans once his @entity8 became law			1
' if you have or had one of these plans before the @entity8 came into law and you really liked that plan , what we said was you can keep it – if it has n’t changed since the law passed , ' he claimed			1
' so we wrote into the @entity8 , you 're grandfathered in on that plan			2
but if the insurance company changes it , then what we 're saying is they 've got to change it to a higher standard			0
' he remarks came at the posh @entity30 during a meeting of @entity32 , the nonprofit pressure group that grew out of his presidential campaign organization @entity35			0
but at least 29 videotaped examples available online show @entity2 promising between 2008 and this year , in only slightly varied language , that ' if you like your health care plan , you will be able to keep your health care plan , period			1
' it was n't until after the @entity8 program 's central website had its disastrous launch , and millions of @entity5 began receiving insurance cancellation letters , that the @entity49 took a new tack			1
' you keep your plan ' more recently , the president and his press flacks have begun to insert into that promise the caveat that @entity2 uttered monday : that @entity8 will only let @entity5 keep their existing insurance plans if nothing about them changes from year to year			1
' if the insurance company changes it , then what we 're saying is they 've got to change it to a higher standard , ' @entity2 told his fans at the @entity30			2
' they 've got to make it better			0
they 've got to improve the quality of the plan they are selling			0
' the @entity8 itself , however , requires all medical insurance plans sold in the @entity5 to include a raft of minimum coverage benefits , a one - size - fits - all approach that does n't appeal to many buyers			1
pediatric coverage , maternity care and dental insurance , for instance , are options that the elderly , the single and the frugal have chosen not to pay for in previous years			1
requiring those additions , and seven others , have put millions of @entity5 with ' grandfathered ' policies in the position of being forbidden to keep plans they have happily purchased and renewed for years			2
one estimate has 2.5 million such cancellation letters already sent in the @entity5 , with a peak of 12 million or more expected by year 's end			1
in a january 2010 speech , @entity2 promised taxpayers that ' if you want to keep the health insurance you 've got , you can keep it ' game change : @entity111 secretary @entity110 was left holding the bag as @entity8 's online launch fell apart , and may keep catching spears for @entity2 as @entity5 become more frustrated with insurance cancellations some of the videotaped examples of @entity2 's campaign - style rhetoric are striking for their unqualified language			1
during a june 15 , 2009 speech at the @entity121 's annual meeting , he pledged that ' no matter how we reform health care , we will keep this promise to the @entity5 people : if you like your doctor , you will be able to keep your doctor , period			1
( if you like your health care plan , you 'll be able to keep your health care plan , period			2
' on september 12 of that year , he told an @entity8 rally in @entity134 that ' nothing in this plan requires you to change what you have if you 're happy with it			1
' @entity2 's january 27 , 2010 @entity139 to @entity140 included the reassurance that ' our approach would preserve the right of @entity5 who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan			1
' speaking at @entity149 in suburban @entity150 on march 27 , 2010 , he doubled down on that claim			0
' if you like your doctor , you ’re going to be able to keep your doctor , ' @entity2 said , to strong applause			2
' if you like your plan , keep your plan			0
' ' i do n’t believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in @entity5			1
i think it ’s time to give you , the @entity5 people , more control over your health			0
' his rhetoric got progressively more definitive as 2010 wore on			0
' if you 're happy with what you 've got , ' nobody 's changing it , ' the president said in september 2010 , just weeks before that year 's congressional midterm election this man 's @entity178 policy was cancelled , and he was offered new insurance at nearly triple the price			2
he send this photo to @entity183 the president abruptly changed his promise on monday , telling a friendly crown that ' if you have or had one of these plans before the @entity8 came into law and you really liked that plan , what we said was you can keep it ¿ if it hasn ¿ t changed since the law passed ' on april 1 in @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity2 promised that ' if @entity5 like their doctor , they will keep their doctor			1
and if you like your insurance plan , you will keep it			0
' ' no one will be able to take that away from you			0
it has n’t happened yet			0
t wo n’t happen in the future			0
' later , during his october 12 , 2012 presidential debate with @entity212 @entity211 , the president assured @entity5 that ' if you 've got health insurance , [ @entity8 ] does n't mean a government takeover			1
you keep your own insurance			0
you keep your own doctor			0
' @entity218 ( look it up ) : rep. @entity219 floated his own health care bill in 2009 while insisting that @entity2 could n't possibly keep his promises taken together , the @entity224 's fact - checker wrote last week , ' his repeated pledge ... is one of the most famous statements of his presidency			1
' the @entity224 gave it a dreaded ' four @entity230 ' rating for dishonesty , its worst grade			0
the paper says four - @entity235 lies qualify as ' whoppers			0
' ' the president 's statements were sweeping and unequivocal – and made both before and after the bill became law , ' the @entity224 ruled			2
' the @entity49 now cites technicalities to avoid admitting that he went too far			0
' the @entity224 noted , too , that @entity212 were calling shenanigans on @entity2 's pledge as early as the first year of his presidency			1
@entity246 @entity212 rep. @entity219 , a medical doctor himself , proposed an alternative health care bill in 2009			0
during the @entity212 's weekly address on aug. 24 of that year , @entity219 claimed @entity2 was n't playing it straight			1
' on the stump , the president regularly tells @entity5 that " if you like your plan , you can keep your plan , " ' @entity219 said			0
' but if you read the bill , that just is n’t so			0
' ' for starters , within five years , every health care plan will have to meet a new federal definition for coverage – one that your current plan might not match , even if you like it			2
' @entity2 is now calling those plans ' substandard , ' and playing up his insurance law 's aspiration to upgrade every policy , even at a sometimes significant cash price			1
the website @entity183 has collected dozens of insurance cancellations letters from @entity5 who have lost their policies			2
most are being told to choose between renewing at more than twice the price , or casting their lot with the @entity8 federal health insurance exchange .			2

@entity2 suddenly *pivoted* monday night , adding conditions to his pledge that no one would lose insurance plans that they liked
the @entity8 requires policies to include a set of coverage items including maternity and pediatric care , whether or not people want it
as costs rise , insurance companies are *issuing* cancellation letters by the millions
the @entity49 is n't offering *apologies* for the about - face , even though the left - of - center @entity224 found that @entity2 's ' if you like your plan , you can keep your plan ' promise was a ' whopper ' of a lie
