regional police spokesman @entity30 told reporters @entity23 teams discovered the body after extinguishing a fire in the small cellar that was accessible only through a hidden door			1

police ' had to push against the wall to enter the room , ' he said			2
and because ' the perpetrator could have been hiding behind each corner , ' the search took more than four hours as police cautiously combed through the two story building , said @entity51			2
