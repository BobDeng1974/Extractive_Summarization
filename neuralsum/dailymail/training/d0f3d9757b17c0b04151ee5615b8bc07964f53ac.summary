caffeine is causing ' untimely deaths ' and its ' lethality ' is being underestimated , a leading expert has warned caffeine is so dangerous and is being consumed in such high quantities that it should now be regulated , a leading expert claims			1
dr @entity9 says that the stimulant is causing ‘ untimely deaths ’ and that its ' lethality ' is being underestimated			1
dr @entity9 , editor in chief of the @entity14 , and head of the department of psychology at @entity18 , @entity19 , says he is concerned that the substance is increasingly being added to products such as energy drinks , alcoholic drinks and medicines			1
as a result , many of us are unwittingly consuming way more than we think - with worrying implications for our health and society as a whole			1
dr @entity9 believes the risks caffeine poses to our health are so great that products that contain it should be taxed and restricted like cigarettes and alcohol			1
sales to children in particular should be restricted			0
he says that as well as tea and coffee , caffeine is found in fizzy drinks , energy drinks , bottled water , alcoholic drinks ( such as @entity47 ) , cookies , chewing gum , yogurt and flavoured milk			1
it is also commonly found in cold and flu remedies , weight loss pills , mints , cosmetics , soaps and even tights to aid slimming			0
even more worrying , he says that caffeine is also frequently used as a diluent ( cutting agent ) in illicit drugs			2
he notes that while some countries in @entity69 and @entity70 have begun to take regulatory action , including sales restrictions and product labelling , most countries including the @entity66 and the @entity67 have a ‘ regulatory vacuum ’			1
in his provocative editorial ' death by @entity5 : how many caffeine - related fatalities and near - misses @entity77 before we regulate ? ' , he argues that the trend of children downing energy drinks is exacerbating the problem			1
he says that in order to highlight the risks of caffeine , products should be labelled with the amount they contain and sales to children in particular should be restricted			2
caffeine : table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances the @entity100 announced last year that it is investigating reports of five deaths being linked to @entity104 drinks			1
the company has denied any link			0
and in 2009 , a father from @entity108 said his 11 - year - old son hanged himself after energy drinks changed his behaviour			2
@entity112 said his son @entity113 was a happy - go - lucky child until he started downing the drinks to make himself feel grown up			2
@entity113 went from thriving at school and impressing neighbours with his good behaviour to becoming ' hyper and disruptive ' in the months leading to his death last year			0
a one - litre caffeine drink was lying near @entity113 's body when his mother found him hanging in his bedroom			1
dr @entity9 is also concerned that sporty teenagers who drink lots of caffeine are putting their hearts under a great deal of strain			1
he adds that although caffeine has been widely considered to be harmless , ' awareness is increasing that its consumption is associated with substantial harm , including fatalities and near - fatalities '			1
he says that caffeine was named as a contributing factor in 6,309 cases that the @entity140 was notified of in 2011			2
lethal : dr @entity9 ( left ) says caffeine is causing ‘ untimely deaths ’			1
in 2009 , 11 - year old @entity143 ( right ) was found hanged after downing energy drinks and the annual number of emergency room visits in the @entity67 associated with energy drinks jumped 36 per cent to 20,000 in 2011 compared to the previous year , according to a report released by the @entity148			2
in just one year , the substance killed four people in @entity151 , adds dr @entity9			1
he says that caffeine - in the form of energy drinks - also offsets the sedating effects of alcohol and encourages people to drink more			1
furthermore , there is a ' growing body of evidence ' which indicates that compared to alcohol alone , adding caffeine increases the risk of having unprotected sex , experiencing or committing sexual assault , drink driving and being violent			2
there is also evidence that children who drink caffeine are more likely to use alcohol , drugs and smoke in the future there is also evidence that caffeine consumption by children may also make them more likely to use alcohol , drugs and smoke in the future			2
according to the @entity179 , there is no recommended daily limit on caffeine because the amount people can tolerate varies hugely depending on a number of factors , such as age , weight and average caffeine consumption			0
a study by the government regulatory agency @entity190 concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect , such as anxiety or heart problems			0
indeed , we can become used to caffeine over time			0
the only exception is for pregnant women , who are advised to consume no more than 200mg of caffeine a day , as it can have adverse effects on birth weight and pregnancy outcome			0
children should have no more than 75mg			0
an 8oz can of @entity104 has 92mg , while an 8oz @entity206 can has 83mg			0
a bottle of @entity208 contains 58mg of caffeine , while a an 8oz cup of decaf coffee has 5mg and hot chocolate has 9mg			0
caffeine intoxication is recognised by the @entity215 as a medical condition			0
symptoms include nervousness , anxiety , restlessness , insomnia , stomach upset , tremors and rapid heartbeat			0
two known triggers of the heart rhythm disorder supraventricular tachycardia ( @entity227 ) are caffeine and alcohol , so the risk increases if they are taken at the same time			0
@entity231 can make your heart beat very quickly - up to 160 beats per minute			0
the result can be terrifying palpitations , chest pain , dizziness and feeling out of breath .			0

dr @entity9 claims that the stimulant is causing ‘ untimely deaths ’
says its ' lethality ' is being underestimated as it 's widely considered harmless
but caffeine is now in many everyday foods , drinks , medicines and *toiletries* , meaning we are unwittingly consuming or *exposed* to more than we think
