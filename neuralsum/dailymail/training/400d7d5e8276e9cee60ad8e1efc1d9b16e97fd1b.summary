for one father , trying to make the best of his daughter 's eye problem is as simple as being creative with a marker pen			0
@entity6 , 11 months , was born with a cataract in her right eye so she must wear a patch on her left eye for two hours a day to strengthen it			1
so her father @entity12 , 31 , from the @entity13 , @entity14 , simply draws a new design on her patch every day ' to make it fun ' and takes a picture			1
@entity19 , 11 months , must wear a patch for two hours a day to help strengthen her right eye creative father @entity12 draws fun designs such as a flower , left , or a bug , on @entity6 's eye patches @entity6 gets half a pair of spectacles just like her father @entity12 , who took the enchanting snaps the adorable baby was born with a small cataract that affects the sight in her right eye so in order to help the injured eye develop properly , she has worn a patch over her stronger eye for two months			1
she wo n't need surgery and the family hope patching will be enough but she will continue to have to wear one until she 's four or five years old			0
stay - at - home father @entity12 said he quickly came up with the idea to decorate them			2
' we bought some patches for her and they were a little weird to look at , so i started drawing on them the next day to make it more fun for both of us , ' he said			2
' she 's too young to really know what 's going on but i always show her the pictures before i put it on			0
she likes the pictures but she 's much happier when it 's time to take it off			0
' the adorable baby was born with a cataract in her right eye , so the patch helps her vision develop correctly when it 's cold , @entity6 gets a patch decorated with a snowman complete with top hat and carrot nose seeing out of one eye does n't slow @entity6 down			1
she looks playful with cartoon characters on her patch in the pictures , @entity6 certainly seems a very sunny baby and always has a big smile			1
@entity12 takes pictures of @entity6 every day and sends them to his family			1
he has drawn a range of designs on her skin - coloured patches including eyes inspired by @entity76 , @entity77 from @entity78 , @entity79 , as well as a heart and a floating balloon			0
and so far he has come up with original drawing every day			0
he said : ' the designs are mostly pop culture things that i think will be funny or cute			0
i have n't repeated any yet and i snap a picture with my @entity88 every day			0
it even doubles as a name badge ! @entity12 writes his daughter 's name in block capitals and colours them red @entity6 channels @entity96 with this traditional black patch drawn on the skin - coloured medical one @entity77 from @entity78 provides inspiration for this design - which is n't interfering in @entity6 's story time one bit babies and toddlers wear patches to help the eye send correct messages to the brain to prevent a lazy eye from developing			1
this occurs when the vision in one eye does n't fully develop during childhood and ca n't necessarily be corrected with glasses in later life			2
@entity12 posted the pictures and @entity6 's predicament on the social media website @entity119 , noting that she often rubs her patch and gets irritable			1
his fellow users offered messages of support about their own experiences of wearing eye patches and some invaluable advice			0
@entity12 said : ' the best advice i received was to put a little @entity129 on her eyebrow so the patch does n't rip her hair out when i take it off			2
i thought that was genius			0
' a trip round the supermarket is given some comic book cool with a @entity6 's @entity79 eye patch @entity6 's clearly a little star , so naturally dad @entity12 drew a yellow five point star with a face on her patch			1

@entity6 , 11 months , must wear a patch every day to help her vision

@entity12 , from the @entity14 , draws comic book pictures on the patches
