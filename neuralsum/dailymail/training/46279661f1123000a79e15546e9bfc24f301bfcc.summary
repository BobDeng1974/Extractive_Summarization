by @entity0 published : 16:43 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 18:22 est , 6 june 2012 parents who force their children to marry face jail sentences under tough laws to be unveiled tomorrow by @entity5			2
the home secretary will promise a sweeping crackdown after warnings that up to 8,000 young women a year are pushed into wedlock without their consent			1
@entity12 says forced marriage , which involves families from @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and east @entity19 , is ' little more than slavery ' and ' completely wrong '			1
the home secretary has warned that up to 8,000 young women a year are pushed into wedlock without their consent the new laws will see the government tackling an issue which has proved highly sensitive in the past			1
in 2004 , @entity26 considered making forced marriage a criminal offence , but dropped the plans before the 2005 general election amid fears it would be resented by ethnic voters as an ' intrusion ' into minority cultures			1
forced marriage prevention orders were introduced in 2008 , but these put the onus on a victim to apply to a civil court for protection , rather than criminalising those who tried to force them into marrying			1
for a criminal conviction , the authorities must currently try to prove that those responsible have broken other laws , such as kidnapping , false imprisonment , harassment , or assault			2
breaching a prevention order is also punishable by up to two years in jail , but for contempt of court			0
tomorrow mrs may will announce that a specific criminal offence of forced marriage will be created , meaning anyone who tries to compel someone to wed against their will could be jailed			1
legislation is expected to be introduced next year			2
it is part of the government 's attempt to smash @entity26 's doctrine of multiculturalism , which ministers argue meant unacceptable practices such as forced marriage were not tackled effectively			1
@entity12 has said while most weddings involving families from @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and east @entity19 are happy celebrations , the government will crack down on forced marriages home secretary @entity5 ( left ) and @entity12 are spearheading the tough new laws that will be announced tomorrow mr @entity12 believes a blind eye has been turned to extremism for too long for fear of offending minorities			1
some schools have even refused to put up posters advising pupils about forced marriage for fear of causing offence or being branded racist			1
last year , 1,468 forced marriages were investigated by the authorities but experts believe the true total is as high as 8,000 a year			2
cases often involve a girl or young woman being taken abroad , usually on the pretext of a holiday , then forced to marry a man they have never met in accordance with an arrangement reached by the two families			2
one young girl from @entity98 was married off by her parents when she had just turned five , while two teenage sisters were forced to wed strangers on the same day during a trip to @entity17			0
a government source said : ' some of those who oppose the criminalisation of forced marriage argue that it could disempower victims , as they might want a non-criminal resolution of their case and reconciliation with their family			1
@entity114 said in the worst cases children were drugged and taken overseas , where they were married off ' however , to avoid deterring victims from coming forward , the civil remedy will continue to exist alongside a new criminal offence			1
this means that a victim could choose to take the civil route , or to go to the police			0
' even when criminal proceedings are under way , the victim will have the right to stop those proceedings			0
' the new law will be accompanied by a range of measures to increase protection and support for victims , as well as maintaining a focus on prevention			0
' mrs may will announce a Â£ 500,000 fund to ensure schools and other agencies know how to spot early signs of a forced marriage			1
every local authority will have one official in charge of training for police , judiciary , health agencies and social services			0
the government also plans an advertising campaign over the summer to highlight ' the right to choose ' who you marry			0
and ministers will sign up to the @entity158 's convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence , which requires the criminalisation of various forms of violence against women , including forced marriage			1
conservative chairman @entity114 , who has pushed for a change in the law , said in the worst cases children were drugged and taken overseas , where they were married off			0
' it 's now time to say no. the tragedy of these stories is long term			0
people are trapped in loveless marriages for a long , long , long time , ' she said			0
' there is often no relationship and they live as strangers in the same home			0
forced marriage is akin to slavery and it is going on in @entity186 today			1
but it is time to draw a line in the sand and say enough			0
' the new law will seek to draw a clear distinction between arranged and forced marriage			2
' a forced marriage is where there is no consent			2
the time has come to call a halt , ' @entity114 added			0
the cross-party @entity200 had called for forced marriage to be criminalised , but ministers have spent some months considering how to proceed without discouraging victims from coming forward			2
one further measure being considered is for all those marrying abroad to be legally required to declare their intent first with their local registrar in @entity186			0
religious ceremonies would be void unless they were also entered in the civil register .			0
