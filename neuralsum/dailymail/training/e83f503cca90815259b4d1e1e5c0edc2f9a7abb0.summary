‘ everything in a collaboration is supposed to be mutually approved			0
but @entity1 did the most disgusting photo shoot ever and never even told me about it , ’ the 24 - year - old fumed			1
' however a few hours after her angry tweets , she released three images on her @entity39 account from the campaign that she said she ' absolutely loved ' alongside a statement			1
‘ for the record : i absolutely love these images they are from the shoot i directed for my @entity1 campaign			2
im incredibly proud of the shoes we 've made together , as well as these images that i 've been anxiously waiting to share with you all , ’ @entity0 wrote next to a montage from the vibrant shoot			1
angry : the 24 - year - old did n't hold back when it came to calling out the popular @entity57 shoe brand in shock : @entity0 claims she had no idea about the photos until she saw them on a ' random tumblr ' page adding : ‘ what i had a " rant " about on @entity9 is n't in regards to these pictures , it was about another , different set of images i was n't a part of creating that i felt were n't reflective of my vision and direction for the collection			1
’ ‘ i 'm an artist and i 'm extremely passionate and emotional and crazy sometimes because i care @entity79 about this s * * * ! i love @entity1 and he gets it ! artists clash sometimes , it does n't mean i dislike the brand			0
’ with her debut shoe line dropping imminently the star insisted she is looking forward to collaborating with @entity1 for three more seasons but was simply fighting for her artistic integrity : ‘ i love @entity1 as an individual and as a company , ' @entity0 defended			1
she finished off her long post by saying she truly believed in the collection and that she put her ‘ heart and soul ’ into making it			0
‘ i did n't mean for it to turn into some big blog situation ( as usual ) but i 'm not gon na sit back and totally let @entity1 get dragged under the bus because as a whole they 're awesome ppl			0
i just do n't support neoprene @entity101 sandals with socks			0
that all , ' she concluded			0
in the approved photos posted to her @entity39 account , the @entity105 rapper wears a red crop - top and matching shorts as she shows off her endless legs in a pair of royal blue platform shoes from her collection , while a woman holding a goldfish nuzzles up to her			1
damage control ? the website @entity16 has since been taken down , however the campaign images which earned @entity0 's ire are circulating online later @entity0 leans up against a railing in a green sports bra , waisted white shorts , a flowing kimono and strappy platforms			1
however the ' gross ' images in question , which have circulated online , show a woman posing provocatively in socks and sandals			1
earlier in the day , the outspoken star took to @entity9 to let off some steam about a @entity132 that was believed to be set up by the company			0
‘ i ’m just now seeing it as its uploaded on some random tumblr page and iam [ sic ] livid , ’ she tweeted			2
before adding : ‘ i worked really hard on the creative direction of both the shoes and the shoot i was involved with and in			0
’ putting her foot in it ? hours after her @entity9 tirade , the star took to her @entity39 account to clear up some things mad about shoe : @entity0 has been giving fans a sneak peek of her creations over the last few months			1
in october the star posted this image saying ' these are just my personal favorites ' ‘ i really feel it ’s been tainted with these @entity160 awful images that @entity1 took appon [ sic ] themselves to create and share without my knowledge			1
gross gross gross , ’ the blonde beauty raged			2
‘ @entity166 [ sic ] been bamboozled with a tumblr page where everyone wears sock and taken unintentional crotch shots on pool toys			2
i ’m in shock , ’ she capped off the rant			0
@entity0 has since deleted the tweets			1
@entity175 have reached out to both @entity0 and @entity1 for comment			1
her boss @entity177 , who signed her in 2012 , told @entity179 that instead of going on @entity9 rants , the rapper should be putting her energy into her music			1
bad timing : the rapper 's debut shoe line with @entity1 is set to drop next month ' @entity160 awful ' : images from the unauthorised shoot show a woman provocatively posing in socks and sandals devastated : the @entity105 superstar has since deleted her tweets and the @entity132 page has been blocked fans react : ' can see why @ @entity197 is p * * * * * off with the images @ @entity199 put up to promote the new range with her ! # tacky , ’ one user wrote on @entity9 @entity202 at @entity201 embroidered jumper shop the look for less below visit site winter has finally showed up			1
