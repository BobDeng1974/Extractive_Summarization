when you ’re in a rush , it might feel like it takes forever to get a pan of water to boil			0
but according to an @entity8 engineering professor , the key to speedy cooking is a bit of rocket science			1
dr @entity11 is an expert on jet and rocket engines , particularly the techniques used to manage and transfer engine heat in the most effective way			0
now he has brought the benefits of his knowledge to the nation ’s kitchens , dreaming up a new saucepan design which knocks a minute off a boiled egg ’s cooking time			0
from start to finish , it would normally take around six minutes to boil an egg – three minutes for the water to boil plus another three minutes of cooking time			0
but dr @entity11 ’s patented new design could reduce this by roughly a minute , which might prove useful for people who need to cook a quick meal in the morning			0
called the @entity37 , the saucepan works best with gas hobs			0
it has a series of fins which direct flames quickly and evenly up the side of the pan , holding the heat far more effectively than traditional versions			2
the main body is aluminium but the handles are made of stainless steel , so will not reach the same searing temperatures as the base			0
flare pans , which can also be used with electric , ceramic and halogen hobs , reach the right cooking temperature around 34 per cent faster – and use 28 per cent less energy than conventional pans			1
the @entity8 professor of engineering has now formed a partnership with @entity62 homewares to turn his prototype into a finished product			1
the new range will be available in the @entity67 exclusively through the firm ’s stores and website			0
but the cost of joining the kitchen space age comes with some pretty galactic prices – the designs range from £ 49.99 for a milk pan to £ 59.99 for a ten - inch frying pan , £ 64.99 for a saucepan and £ 84.99 for a top - of - the - range stockpot			1
dr @entity11 said : ‘ a lot of tests have been done comparing @entity37 pans to conventional saucepans and they have proved to be at least 30 per cent faster in coming to the boil			2
’ the pans go on sale next month starting at £ 49.99			1
the finned design channels heat from a gas flame across the bottom and up both sides , to capture energy that would otherwise be wasted			1
this results in the pan heating up significantly more quickly and cooking food faster			1
it claims to be 40 per cent more efficient and consequently , faster .			2

the energy efficient flare design , which has fins , was dreamed up by a professor of engineering at @entity8
the shape of the pan channels heat from a gas flame across the bottom and up both sides , to capture energy that would otherwise be wasted
this means it can heat food faster using 40 per cent less energy
the pans , which are made from cast aluminium , will go on sale at @entity62 next month , with prices starting at £ 49.99
