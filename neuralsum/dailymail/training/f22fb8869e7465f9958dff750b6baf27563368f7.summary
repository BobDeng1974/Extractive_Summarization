mother 's love : seven - year - old polar bear mother @entity7 snuggles up with her twin cubs after they were born at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , on monday , the first time such a birth has been filmed in colour rare moment : the tiny twins are the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in @entity17 this year and , incredibly , their mother positioned herself in the direct view of @entity21 cameras set up to record the moment by yesterday both twins were said to be developing well , with their mother taking excellent care of them			1
' they are both regularly drinking her milk			0
in between they are tumbling around on mum , ' the zoo said in a statement			2
@entity7 gave birth to the first of the pair at 8.39am on monday following a short labour			0
minutes earlier she had been biting her front paw to counteract the pain of contractions , before the eight - inch - long cub slid out			0
the infant cub was hairless , smeared in blood , blind and deaf			0
less than a quarter of an hour later , following another contraction that spurred @entity7 to shake and push her back legs forcefully against the wall , a thin arm , small head and then another arm of another cub came into view			0
however , @entity7 was so busy with her first born that she did n't immediately realise that she 'd even given birth to a second baby for another 20 minutes			2
after finally noticing the tiny second cub she turned her head and picks it up carefully in her mouth before laying it on her leg next to its older sibling to suckle			0
colour footage from surveillance cameras captured both births at close range - the first time anywhere in the world that a polar bear birth has been filmed in colour			1
the zoo ’s director , dr. @entity74 , said : ' it is as if we were there live watching the labour and birth of a polar bear and , as if that were n’t enough , @entity7 showed us not one , but two very different births ! ' @entity12 is now bracing itself for a surge in visitors			1
when @entity90 the polar bear was born in @entity91 at the end of 2006 the capital 's animal park was flooded by visitors keen to catch a glimpse of the cub			1
in the meantime , @entity7 has her work cut out merely keeping her youngsters alive			0

but @entity106 's curator , @entity105 , said she was impressed with the polar bear mother 's behaviour so far			2
' our female polar bear , @entity7 , is caring for her twins very capably as if she were an experienced mother , ' said ms @entity105			1
' but at seven years old she is actually a first - time mum ! ' out it comes : @entity7 gave birth to the first of the pair at 8.39am on monday following a short labour			0
minutes earlier she had been biting her front paw to counteract the pain of contractions @entity7 licks clean her tiny baby : the infant cub was hairless , smeared in blood , blind and deaf spectacle : journalists gathered at the zoo to watch as the cubs were born live on @entity21 on monday morning just like in the wild , @entity7 must take care of her young on her own during their risky early period			2
even their father , 14 - year - old @entity130 , is being kept in a separate enclosure until they are fit and healthy			2
@entity134 , @entity13 's mayor and a member of the zoo ’s board of directors , said she was also delighted			0
' the birth of polar bear cubs is definitely a highlight for any zoo and i am overjoyed that we are able to welcome two cubs at once , ' she said .			1
