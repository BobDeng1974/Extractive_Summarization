age shall not weary @entity0 nor the years condemn , but still the veteran @entity3 master could not summon up enough to break the spirit of @entity5			1
turning 33 next month and now the father of four , the extraordinary @entity0 somehow managed to turn sunday ’s @entity8 final into a marathon and gave himself a fleeting sight of victory that may have become a reality against anyone else			2
saving a match point in the fourth set and spurning a break point in the decider , he made a nonsense of the 2013 final — won by @entity20 , of course — being the most difficult act to follow			1
@entity0 came so close to providing something equally poignant but the difference this time was that the @entity25 , replete with a full quorum of a-listers , did not get the winner it wanted as @entity5 finally prevailed 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 in just under four hours			1
it might be unfair to cast the 27 - year - old @entity30 as some @entity32 figure , but again he will have felt almost friendless , faced this time with the ageing hero rather than his @entity36 contemporary trying to make history			0
scroll down to watch @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity40 give their verdict sealed with a kiss : @entity5 kisses the @entity8 trophy after defeating @entity0 in five sets the best : the emotion gets to @entity5 as he lifts his @entity8 trophy on @entity25 centre of attention : @entity5 poses for the cameras with his newest prized possession emotional : @entity5 holds up the @entity8 trophy on the balcony in front of the crowds high and mighty : @entity5 holds the @entity8 trophy aloft to the crowds at @entity57 he 's done it ! @entity5 raises his arms in victory after winning his second title @entity8 title in dramatic style disbelief : @entity5 reacts after finally seeing off veteran @entity0 6 - 4 in the final set emotional reunion : @entity5 hugs his coach and three - time @entity8 champion @entity67 mutual respect : @entity0 and @entity5 shake hands after another epic battle between the pair so close : @entity0 poses with his runner - up trophy alongside @entity5 after just losing out to his younger rival taking it all in : @entity0 looks towards the crowd after suffering another heartbreaking @entity77 final defeat @entity78 wins second @entity8 title @entity0 - @entity80 - 3,773m @entity0 was forced to run some 400m more than @entity5 during the match			1
stats courtesy of @entity83 the one - sided nature of the crowd was a disadvantage but his most potent opponent other than the man across the net was the demon left inside him from so many recent @entity77 final defeats			0
five times in his last six championship matches he had been beaten , usually from promising positions , and that gnawed away as he desperately tried to close out a rampaging @entity0 in the fourth			2
@entity0 was playing a different game , and not just how he sought to attack the net in a way that will have had many of the watching champions such as @entity101 purring			0
for @entity0 this was about adding to his 17 major titles and achieving a historic eighth at @entity8			2
he was playing for his legacy and the chance to put distance between his personal tally and that of the chasing @entity110 , who is on 14			0
achievements already banked can mean less pressure , yet he also aware that time is running short			0
who knows , we may look back on this as when time ran out , for he will be close to 34 when he returns next year			0
power : @entity5 plays a two - handed backhand during a tight first set against @entity0 fully focused : @entity0 keeps his eyes firmly on the ball as he prepares to play a backhand passionate : top seed @entity5 reacts after winning the second set 6 - 4 on the stretch : @entity0 is forced into a desperate lunge to return a strong serve from @entity5 if so , his last appearance in a final at @entity57 will leave the hazy memory of someone who matched effortless style with a competitive spirit so evident in a fourth set of mesmeric theatre			1
the third - set tiebreak had been an exemplar of why @entity137 is the only @entity77 that @entity0 has won in the last four and a half years			2
faced with the warrior spirits of @entity110 , @entity5 and ( sometimes ) @entity20 , he had again flinched when it most matters			0
this is what happens with the onset of age and perhaps , the statistics suggest , the burden of parental responsibility			0
it was there in his hesitant approach to the net at 2 - 3 , or the edgy forehand error at 3 - 5 , the marginal lack of conviction that does not afflict his younger rivals as much			0
and it was there at the start of the fourth set when @entity5 took advantage of his heavy - legged positioning to break for 3 - 1 , as the crowd resigned itself to consoling their idol and being back in the bar for @entity168 ’s o’clock			1
royalty : @entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172 ( centre ) , congratulates @entity5 highness : @entity5 bows his head to the @entity172 ( centre ) after his win frustrated figure : @entity5 reacts after a missed opportunity during the second set flying high : @entity0 propels himself into the air to execute a powerful smash shot no way through : @entity30 star djokovic leans to his right to ensure @entity0 does n't add another ace to his tally staying grounded : @entity5 looks bemused after losing his racket in a fall 7 - the number of @entity77 singles titles @entity5 has won , the same as @entity191 29 - @entity0 hit 29 aces during the match , 16 more than @entity5 3 - @entity0 ’s run to the final means he will overtake @entity196 as the world no 3 67 - @entity0 went to the net 67 times in the final , 32 more than @entity5 9 - @entity0 ’s loss means it is more than nine years since the no 4 seed won a men ’s @entity77 title 75 - @entity0 hit 75 winners , nine more than @entity5 ’s 66 31 - @entity207 is still the oldest man to win @entity8 in the open era — at 31 years and 360 days 102 - @entity5 overtakes @entity110 as the world no 1			1
it will be his 102nd week on top of the rankings @entity0 ’s comeback for 2 - 3 was a false start as he was broken again , but from 2 - 5 down he extracted one throaty roar after another from the @entity25 crowd as he reeled off five games with a combination of groundstroke winners and finely judged forays to the net			0
@entity5 loves a target at the net and passed him repeatedly , but @entity0 would not be daunted as he preyed on the doubts that he knew would float to the surface for an increasingly agitated opponent , who was demanding more respect from a reluctant assembly			2
at 4 - 5 down @entity0 saw off @entity5 ’s first match point with one of the 29 aces he sent down during the course of the afternoon			1
the line judge ’s naked eye disallowed it and ironically it was @entity237 , an innovation the @entity3 has so often sniffed at , that was needed to confirm its authenticity			0
when @entity5 sent a forehand long to concede the set , what would have been arguably the greatest @entity0 victory of all , given his creeping years , looked on			2
taking a breather : @entity0 wipes his face with a towel after taking the first set via a tie - break take that ! @entity5 unleashes a forehand return on @entity25 experienced : @entity0 was appearing in his ninth @entity8 final after winning his seven of his previous eight interested onlooker : former @entity8 champion and coach of @entity5 , @entity67 , watches the action victory : @entity5 throws tennis balls to the crowd from the bridge near @entity25 highs and lows : @entity5 plays a forehand ( left ) and shows his frustration after a missed shot ( right ) in the last of their three @entity8 finals , respective coaches @entity67 and @entity267 played a five - setter and here was another , with @entity0 starting it looking much the fresher			1
@entity5 needed to summon the physio to rub a sore calf muscle after the third game and at 3 - 3 , 30 - 40 came @entity0 ’s chance when he got the serve back but was forced deep and wide on to his backhand and could only float the ball into the net			1
@entity5 ’s return of serve , a shot he has improved to the point of being the all - time master , so nearly brought him the next game but the seven - times champion three - times saved himself			0
only at 5 - 4 did the pressure tell sufficiently for @entity5 to gain the winning break of serve , with anti-climactic ease			1
the vanquished had put on a fabulous show but it was @entity5 , now restored to the world no 1 spot , on his way to the @entity293 ’ dinner last night at the @entity295			0
one day people might come to love him like they do @entity0 — but they both know love does not win you titles			0
no sweat : @entity0 wipes his brow with his wristband as he returns to the baseline to serve going down : @entity5 loses his footing and hits the turf after returning a shot in @entity0 's direction still got it : @entity0 celebrates winning a point ( left ) after a typically precise forehand ( right ) first set : 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) @entity0 – both players produce their best tennis throughout , with no break points on offer			1
a trademark ace helps the seven - time champion to the tie - break win			1
second set : 6 - 4 @entity5 – the @entity30 breaks @entity0 early on and never looks back , with only two unforced errors in the whole set			1
@entity322 : 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) @entity5 – again neck and neck with no breaks , but this time @entity5 dominates the tie - break			1
fourth set : 7 - 5 @entity0 – the most thrilling set in the match by far , with five breaks of serve			2
@entity331 leads 5 - 2 but throws it all away , missing championship point in the process			0
@entity0 wins five games in a row to send it into a decider			0
fifth set : 6 - 4 @entity5 – both men on their last legs but the 27 - year - old finds some of his best tennis when it matters most			1
a few unforced errors from @entity0 help @entity5 break him for the championship			2

@entity5 wins the final set 6 - 4 to earn his second @entity8 title
@entity0 won the first set on a tie - break but @entity5 battled back to lead by two sets to one
the @entity3 star fought back in the fourth to level the match
djokovic last won at @entity8 in 2011
