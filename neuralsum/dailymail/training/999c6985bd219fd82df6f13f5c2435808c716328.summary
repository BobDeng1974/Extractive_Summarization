yet @entity9 , the founder of global juggernaut @entity10 , lives in an unassuming bungalow , favours the meatballs sold by his stores and only ever flies economy class , even though he could own a private jet without it even denting his personal fortune			1
mr @entity9 , who turns 87 tomorrow , even shops in the local market towards the end of the day in order to scoop up bargains , reports the @entity23			1

the billionaire is notoriously careful with money it is a remarkable existence for the man behind a company that recorded an annual net profit of £ 3.2billion and achieved sales of £ 27.6billion throughout 44 countries			0
@entity10 ’s domination of the home - furnishing market is phenomenal			2
it is the planet ’s third largest consumer of wood and there are more @entity10 catalogues printed per year ( 208 million at the last count ) than there are bibles			2

modest : the home of @entity10 founder , @entity9 , in @entity66 success : @entity9 's company is estimated to be the source of a tenth of all beds in @entity72 such is its success , it is said that one in 10 @entity72 is now conceived on an @entity10 bed			1
but this frugality , while genuine , is argued by some to be a facet of his intensely canny ability to manage his own image and that of the company , as evidenced by his expert handling of revelations that he was a member of the pro-fascist @entity85 in 1942			0
