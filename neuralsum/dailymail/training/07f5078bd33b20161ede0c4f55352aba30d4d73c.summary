by @entity0 brought together : @entity1 and his girlfriend @entity2 were brought together when @entity1 was transplanted with the donor heart of @entity2 's brother @entity4 @entity1 fell in love at first sight with the sister of the man whose heart was now beating inside his chest			1
lucky to get the donor heart of @entity12 after his health collapsed because of a genetic heart condition , @entity1 was bowled over when he met @entity2 - just over a year after his transplant			1
although he was only 17 - years - old at the time and she was 26 when they first met in 2004 , the electric chemistry between the pair persisted until they got together in 2010 - with both feeling that deceased @entity4 helped them to become lovers			1
' we had an instant connection – we both feel that @entity4 bought us together , ' @entity1 said to the @entity27 's @entity26			1
@entity1 was a fit teenager when he began to suffer flu - like symptoms in november of 2004			2
one morning he woke in cold sweats to actually see his enlarged heart beating up through his chest and was rushed to hospital			0
doctors told the @entity34 teen that he would need a heart transplant or he would die and so he began the terrifying wait to see if a donor organ would become available			2
sadly for the @entity2 family , but luckily for @entity1 , @entity4 passed away after he suffered head injuries during a drunken fight in his home state of @entity42			1
instant connection : the two first met when @entity1 was 18 and she was 26 - but waited six - years before they started their relationship the heart was moved to be transplanted to @entity1 , who had mixed feelings about his predicament			1
' it was the best day of my life but i knew someone had died for me , ' he said to the @entity26			0
' i felt undeserving , that i had something to do with this person ’s death			0
i struggled with that for a while			0
' tragic : @entity12 died after a drunken fracas at a party in 2004 - and his heart now beats inside @entity1 - who is dating his sister @entity2 during his recovery , @entity1 decided that he wanted to write a letter to the family of the donor - who were protected by anonymity			1
' @entity4 ’s mother @entity70 got in touch immediately and a few months later my mum flew to meet her			2
six months after that i was well enough to visit too			0
' it was an emotional meeting and as @entity70 put her hand on my chest to feel @entity4 ’s heart beating inside me , i saw @entity2 for the first time			1
' we locked eyes – and i was smitten			0
@entity2 felt the connection too but she tried to dismiss it , thinking i was too young			2
' she took me sightseeing for the weekend and we felt so comfortable together , like we ’d known each other our entire lives			0
i visited twice more and felt the same , but we were both dating other people			0
' while school assistant @entity2 thought that @entity1 was too young and had a teenage crush on her , the two lost contact for five - years - but got back in touch using @entity88 in 2010			1
' we were both single for the first time and everything just fell into place , ' said @entity1			2
now 34 , @entity2 said that the shared connection that the two felt was undeniable			2
' he was still very young and i thought he might have a teenage crush , ' she said to the @entity26			0
' i tried to dismiss my confused feelings			0
but i could n’t stop thinking about @entity1 – he made me feel happy			2
happy : the couple were brought together when @entity1 began to suffer heart failure as he suffered a genetic condition ' after we reconnected via @entity88 in 2010 everything changed			1
he came to visit and for the first time i felt really nervous around him			0
' when he left , i could n’t stop thinking about him , my heart was just racing			0
' while @entity1 was training to be a cardiovascular ultrasound technician in @entity106 , @entity2 was living in @entity107 - so the two began a long - distance relationship			1
for @entity2 's family , the beginning of her relationship was difficult - especially for her mother and her 14 - year - old son , @entity114			1
however , once they all witnessed @entity2 and @entity1 together , they all came to realize that maybe it was @entity4 who had played some part in their relationship			1
' i know he brought us together and i know he is watching over us , ' said @entity1 , who moved to be with @entity2 and is now a medical technician at a @entity107 hospital			1
thankful : the happy couple believe that is is @entity4 who has helped them to find happiness with each other - almost ten years on from his death ' all of the family tell me stories about @entity4			1
he is always in my thoughts – and obviously in my heart			0
he was a great guy – he always looked out for people			0
through him , i hope i can do the same			0
if i was to meet him today , it would be like meeting my other half			0
' ' i was now forever connected with this young man who sacrificed his life and chose to save mine , ' @entity1 told the @entity139			2
' he is my hero , my guardian angel and i will be forever grateful for his decision to donate his organs			0
' @entity4 died after becoming involved in an argument at a party with 20 - year - old @entity145			1
while @entity145 was charged with second degree manslaughter after @entity4 fell and hit his head on the concrete driveway - the judge in his case decided that @entity145 was not directly responsible for his death			1
@entity12 tragically died iafter a freak accident in 2005 , aged just 22 the lockets made after the transplant were inscribed with ' @entity1 ' , ' @entity4 ' and the number 552 , referring to the 552nd heart transplant made at the @entity157 he was sentenced to 10 - days in prison after pleading guilty to assault - a verdict which @entity4 's mother , @entity70 and his family , including @entity2 agreed with			1
' that ’s the verdict we wanted			0
it became clear to us that @entity145 was telling the truth – as clear as you could be with alcohol and all the chaos , ' said @entity70			0
according to the @entity171 , whenever @entity2 really misses her brother , she rests her head on @entity1 ’s chest			1
' it ’s a strong beat , ' @entity2 said			2

we ’re aware of the sacrifice that had to be made , ' @entity2 told the @entity171			0
