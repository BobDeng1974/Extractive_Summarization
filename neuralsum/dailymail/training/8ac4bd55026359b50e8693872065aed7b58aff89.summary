by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 when @entity4 swept his penalty kick past @entity6 to win the @entity7 for @entity8 in 2012 , @entity3 fans were sure it would be his last kick of a ball for the west @entity13 club			1
now , just two years later , the @entity15 striker looks set for a return to @entity17 and the place he called home for eight years			1
@entity4 may have looked like his younger self during games against weaker opposition while playing for @entity51 last season , but his poor performances against @entity8 in the @entity7 prove that he may no longer be able to affect the big games			2
by coming back to west @entity13 , @entity4 does run the risk of tarnishing one of football 's greatest fairy - tales in almost single - handedly inspiring a team to their first ever @entity7 , but even at 36 , surely @entity8 fans would look to @entity4 rather than their forlorn striker @entity61 should the pair warm the bench together			1
last season 's star of @entity66 , @entity67 , will be the man trying to fill the void left by @entity4 in 2012 and the former @entity70 man will be @entity8 's main striker with a Â£ 32million price - tag and string of failed @entity8 strikers looming in his subconscious			1
hero : @entity8 fans displayed this banner upon @entity4 's first return to @entity17 blue : the @entity15 seemed to be overwhelmed with emotion as @entity51 lost to @entity8 if there 's one team that will be hoping @entity4 does n't return to @entity8 , it will be @entity83			1
the @entity15 powerhouse scored 13 goals in 14 games against the @entity87 during his eight year spell in the @entity33			0
@entity4 's role for the new @entity33 season , should he finalise the move to @entity8 , would be one of support , personality and power			2
you can see it now , @entity67 bullies opponent 's into submission for 70 minutes before being replaced by the man mountian that is @entity4 just when they thought it was safe			0
and that kind of impact , putting that fear into rivals may be all @entity26 wants from his trusted lieutenant			0
the likes of @entity109 and @entity110 speak glowlingly about the @entity8 legend and recall his influence in the dressing room as one of the driving forces behind their team 's success since 2004			2
friends : @entity8 captain @entity110 will be pleased with the idea of a @entity4 reunion silverware : @entity4 won 10 trophies during his time with the west @entity13 club @entity124 weighs up @entity8 return in eight years at @entity8 , @entity4 helped the @entity3 to 10 trophies , including three @entity33 titles and his experience in a young @entity8 squad will be huge			1
@entity8 have lost @entity130 and @entity109 in recent weeks , two @entity8 stalwarts that will leave a hole in the club 's dressing room			0
@entity26 is clearly keen to regain some of the winning mentality and experience that the club have lost this summer			0
leader : @entity8 boss @entity26 ( right ) could benefit from @entity4 's experience legend : the 36 - year - old has a brilliant relationship with the @entity3 fans in his pomp , @entity4 was the epitome of a ' big game ' player , scoring a total of nine goals in nine cup final appearances for the @entity3			1
there 's no doubt that the forward will add to his 157 goal tally for @entity8 , but just how much chance he will get to relive his glory days is yet to be seen			0
he may not be the star of @entity17 next season , but @entity4 still has a part to play			0
support : @entity8 fans may witness the ' @entity162 ' this summer			0
