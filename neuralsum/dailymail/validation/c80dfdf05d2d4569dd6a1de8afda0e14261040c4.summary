at last , @entity0 has made it into @entity3 ’s @entity2			1
it only took 11 years and 41 others - including @entity6 and @entity7 - to come before the club ’s greatest ever goalscorer , with 266 goals in 379 appearances , was rewarded			1
depending who you speak to , the long wait is down to @entity0 declining the offers , or the club not forthcoming with them			1
@entity0 ( left ) is the highest ever scorer for @entity3 with 266 goals in 379 appearances @entity18 ( centre ) joined @entity3 in 1961 and won the @entity20 twice and the @entity21 @entity0 ( second right ) holds the @entity21 aloft after @entity3 's 1963 triumph @entity0 was signed for @entity3 from @entity24 by @entity25 for £ 99,999 the truth lies somewhere in between , with @entity0 understood to have turned down informal invitations in the past but accepting , according to sources close to the former striker , their first formal request last week			1
ultimately , it does n’t matter how he got there			2
he is there now ; number 42			2
despite claims to the contrary , @entity0 has been back to @entity37 on many occasions since he left the club in 1970			1
he went back for the funerals of @entity25 and @entity41 and launched his autobiography ‘ greavsie ’ at a dinner there			2
he just has n’t been back for football matches			2
but he ’s only been to one football match - a @entity48 game with his @entity48 - mad grandson - since he quit playing 35 years ago			0
wherever he goes , he is constantly asked by @entity3 fans why he is not recognised as one of their greatest by the club			1
‘ for all the fans who have asked me when i will be in the @entity56 , i am delighted that we now have a date , ’ @entity0 said upon the announcement on monday			1
‘ i am looking forward to returning to @entity37 for this very special occasion			0
’ @entity0 , now 75 , joined @entity3 in 1961 , signed by @entity25 for £ 99,999 from @entity24 to alleviate the burden of being the first £ 100,000 @entity62 player			1
in the preceding nine years , he would go on to win the @entity20 twice , @entity63 twice , the @entity21 and finish runner - up in the old @entity66 , scoring 220 goals in 321 league matches			0
he was gutted and angry when he was eventually sold to @entity69 , but that ’s not why he does n’t go back to @entity37 for matches			0
@entity0 just likes watching games on the telly			1
in response to accusations that he turned down an invite to the @entity78 final when his two former clubs @entity48 and @entity3 met on march 1 , he replied : ‘ at no point did @entity3 invite me to the game			2
i would n't have gone if they did , but i was not invited			0
‘ i 've got a lovely giant screen hd tv , a lovely dog and a warm fire			0
that 's where i watch sport including football and it 's very nice			2
i 'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold			0
i love it on tv			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) played for @entity3 for nine years and is to be inducted into the @entity2 on may 13 @entity0 is also @entity93 's fourth - highest scorer , netting 44 goals in 57 games for his country now 75 , @entity0 chooses not to attend football matches , preferring instead to enjoy them at home @entity0 also loved playing , and is still @entity93 ’s fourth - highest scorer with 44 in 57 appearances , but he has not shunned @entity3 matches , or those of any other club , with any malicious intent			1
‘ i do n't go to games , i never ever have , ’ he added			0
‘ when i was young i played all the time			0
i 've never supported one team over another and i do n't apologise for that			0
i enjoy watching at home on tv			0
’ regardless of the rows or the disagreements or how he got there , when @entity0 is inducted on may 13 , he will finally be in @entity3 ’s @entity2			1

@entity0 joined @entity3 in 1961 and became their greatest scorer
@entity0 is to become the 42nd *member* of @entity3 's @entity2
@entity18 will be officially inducted by the club on may 13
