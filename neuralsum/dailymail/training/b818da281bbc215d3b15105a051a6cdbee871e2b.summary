by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 18:39 est , 24 january 2014 spy : 8,000 hidden cameras like this one photograph the cars on @entity7 's roads 26 million times every day police are recording 26million images of motorists every day – an increase of 61 per cent since 2012 , it emerged yesterday			1
senior officers say the system is invaluable in preventing and solving serious crime and terror attacks			0
but civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight			0
the images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic numberplate recognition ( @entity24 ) cameras across the @entity7			1
in 2012 , 16million images were recorded every day by cameras – many of them unmarked – which are positioned on motorways and a and b roads			1
each time a vehicle passes , a camera takes a picture of the vehicle ’s numberplate and another of the front of the car , including the driver ’s face			0
the cameras are operated by individual police forces but the records are stored on a national database of 17 billion images , used by police and intelligence services to track criminals			1
however , it also contains the records of innocent motorists , showing a detailed map of their daily journeys			0
police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras , saying to do so would undermine the effectiveness of the system			0
it is thought that by 2018 , between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day			1
the network of cameras is already so extensive that it allows police forces to track where vehicles have gone every single day			1
pictures can be checked against the @entity67 and used by the @entity68 in the battle against crime			2
the first cameras were installed in @entity7 on the @entity72 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles			1
by 2005 , the number of cameras had increased to 2,000 and there are now more than 8,000			2
as well as fixed cameras , police forces use mobile units - with more than 100 in @entity80 alone			2
@entity81 , director of @entity82 , said the technology is being secretly rolled out without the public 's knowledge			0
' @entity24 is a classic example of a very intrusive technology being rolled out with zero public debate			2
tracked : the @entity90 archive of 17 billion images works out as nearly 500 pictures of every one of the 36 million cars on @entity7 's roads ' the public has n't been given even the most basic information about what information is being recorded , how long it is kept or who is able to access it			1
' when you consider the system allows every journey to be tracked , down to the second , and for someone to search through the entire log of when your car was scanned and where , it is without doubt an extremely intrusive system			0
' how many people would have said yes if they had been asked to install a device on their car so the police could monitor their journeys ? yet this is exactly what @entity24 technology allows			2
secret camera : more @entity24 cameras are expected to be rolled out over the next five years ' it is a total failure of law and oversight if this massive yet secretive expansion of @entity24 systems is legal			1
' @entity126 , from the @entity127 , said : ' given the nature of @entity24 it is understandable that some will be concerned about how this data is used			2
' @entity24 has only ever been for the prevention and detection of crime as well as locating vulnerable people with the intent of preserving life			1
' it has saved lives , brought serious , violent offenders to justice and is used in the detection of would - be terrorists			0
it ’s not about tracking every vehicle ’s journey – which is an exaggeration of @entity24 ’s capabilities			0
' currently we have an average of 7,750 active cameras within any seven day period and an average daily read of 26 million			1
' however an increase to 50 or 75 million is not anticipated at this time and there are no current plans for a mass roll out of @entity24 cameras			1
' the database consists of approximately 17 billion records			1
this data is owned by the chief officers of law enforcement agencies who act as data controllers			0
' police forces want to share the information harvested by the cameras with countries across @entity167			0
a spokesman for the @entity169 said : ' anpr is a vital tool and we support its use where it is legitimate and proportionate			0
' we have created a new , independent post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee this			0
' these cameras may only be located where there is an identified need to detect , deter , and disrupt criminality			0
any new @entity24 camera deployment will also require a privacy impact assessment			2

a network of 8,000 cameras photograph cars on @entity7 's roads every day
*government* has a database of 17 billion images stored for up to two years
pictures taken by @entity24 cameras used to fight crime - but privacy campaigners have *voiced* concerns
by 2018 , up to 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day
