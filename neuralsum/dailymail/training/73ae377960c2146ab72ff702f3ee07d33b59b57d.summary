by @entity0 they have long been regarded as a nuisance in the garden but it seems that snails could be more friend than foe when it comes to anti-ageing			0
a revolutionary new facial that involves allowing live snails to slither across the complexion has been hailed the next big thing in beauty thanks to the glow - boosting properties of snail mucus			1
the mucus , which contains a mix of powerful proteins , antioxidants and hyularonic acid , is said to help skin retain moisture , soothe inflammation and remove dead skin			1
the facial , named the @entity50 , costs £ 161 and also includes a series of facial massages , masks and the use of an electrical pulse machine			1
' @entity58 can help the recovery of skin cells on the face , so we expect the snail facial to help heal damaged skin , ' @entity56 , sales manager at @entity43 's @entity42 which offers the treatment , told the @entity65			1
the substance is also believed to help tackle sun damage , according to ms @entity56 , who said : ' we are interested in the fact that snails have a function that can help heal skin damaged by ultraviolet rays			0
' according to ms @entity56 , the salon also uses creams infused with snail slime provided by the salon 's five resident snails which are fed on organic vegetables , including carrots , spinach , @entity83 chard and @entity31 komatsuna greens			2
disgusting though it might sound , snail slime is n't a recent addition to the anti-ageing arsenal and was first used more than 2000 years ago			0
according to records left by early doctor hippocrates , crushed snails mixed with sour milk were used to treat skin inflammation , while more recently , products infused with mollusc slime have proved popular in @entity31 and @entity95			0
despite the long history of snail slime as a beauty treatment , the @entity42 's effort was apparently inspired by @entity101 's recent elevation to @entity103 status			2
climbers are likely to suffer skin damage as they climb the peak , thanks to the thinner air and intense sunshine , and it is this the treatment is intended to fix .			0
