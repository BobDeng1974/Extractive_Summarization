he might not have had the best of seasons by his standards , but @entity5 's two goals for @entity6 at @entity7 's on monday night demonstrated his enduring quality as one of the finest finishers in @entity12 football			1
they are a rare breed ; not always the highest scorers or the most fearsome opponents , but the ones who find the back of the net with aplomb			2
here are @entity22 's top 10 most accomplished finishers in @entity24 history			1
@entity5 is congratulated by team - mates @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 after scoring 10			1
@entity28 another marksman whose sheer quantity of goals should not take away from their quality			0
when @entity28 was in on goal , there was usually only one outcome and he did it 183 times for his boyhood club @entity38			2
@entity43 , as they called him at @entity42 , was clinical and deadly , but he also did it in style			0
@entity38 favourite @entity28 curls home his second goal against @entity47 during a 4 - 0 win at @entity42 a young - looking @entity28 raises his arm in celebration after netting a goal against @entity52 9			0
@entity53 @entity55 fans would vote him onto the list for one goal alone , but @entity53 ’s legend will extend well beyond an unforgettable day in may			1
a prolific striker who had already scored 20 times for the champions this season before being cruelly sidelined by injury , the @entity60 striker is also a stylish finisher who on current form deserves those comparisons with @entity70 and @entity71			1
@entity53 lashes the ball into the top corner during @entity55 's 4 - 1 against @entity74 the @entity60 striker celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity76 in the @entity77 8			1
@entity78 another former @entity6 and @entity80 star			1
ask fans of either of those clubs , and they would tell you that he could frustrate the hell out of them for 89 minutes and then produce a moment of brilliance to light up the match			0
if explosive or hard - working is what you want , then @entity78 ’s not the man			0
but when it comes to finishing , and finishing in style , there were few better than the @entity95			0
@entity78 scores for @entity80 against @entity96 at @entity97 back in december 2006 7			0
@entity98 another one who falls firmly into the category of @entity101 rather than @entity102			1
he was n’t a battering - ram or a net - buster , but @entity98 possessed that flourish and demonstrated it on numerous occasions by scoring more than 360 goals in a career spent at @entity80 , @entity6 and , yes , @entity109			1
@entity98 lifts the ball over @entity112 goalkeeper @entity111 to score for @entity6 6			1
@entity5 the @entity113 has n't been himself since sir @entity114 vacated the manager 's chair at @entity117 , but he came to @entity6 's rescue in style against @entity120			1
the second , in particular , touching @entity123 's deep free - kick past @entity124 with the outside of his left foot , was typical of the panache @entity128 has shown in front of goal over the years for @entity52 and @entity6			1
@entity128 latches on to a poor back - pass from @entity120 's @entity132 and prepares to shoot the former @entity52 striker opens the scoring for @entity6 against @entity120 on monday night the @entity113 popped up again in the second half to prod home @entity123 's deep free - kick @entity128 's second strike went through the legs of @entity120 goalkeeper @entity124 in the second half 5			1
@entity139 @entity139 would feature in a lot of top 10s , and not always for the right reasons			2
he left @entity12 football last summer with a rap sheet as long as his list of achievements			0
but at times during his eventful stay at @entity38 , the @entity147 was simply unstoppable and his ability to score wonderful , spectacular and often audacious goals will live long in the memory			0
@entity139 nods home his second goal for @entity38 against @entity154 during a @entity156 derby in 2012 4			1
@entity157 by the time he had left @entity12 football in 2006 after 11 years at @entity52 , the @entity113 had earned his place in the pantheon of greats			2
every gooner will have his favourite @entity157 goal , but none will forget his poise , panache and even the odd pirouette			0
no wonder there ’s a statue of him at the @entity170			0
@entity157 lifts the ball over @entity173 goalkeeper @entity172 to score at @entity174 's in 2003 3			0
@entity175 at his imperious best , @entity175 could fill up a @entity177 competition all on his own			2
different to the others in the sense that he was an attacking midfielder rather than a striker , the @entity120 legend was equally brilliant			1
he had an ability to dribble past players like they were training - ground dummies and an eye for the outrageous that few could match			0
@entity175 ( left ) scores @entity120 's third goal against @entity6 at the @entity188 in april 1996 2			1
@entity189 he started out life as a winger but at @entity52 developed into one of the most accomplished and stylish strikers in world football			0
@entity189 ’s electrifying pace is what got him into goalscoring positions and , once there , the coolness of thought and precision of finish did the rest			0
@entity189 leaps into the air to score for @entity52 against @entity74 after returning to the @entity205 in 2012 @entity189 is delighted at the final whistle after helping @entity52 win the 2003 fa cup final against @entity120 1			2
@entity208 when it comes down to style , no - one did it quite like @entity208			0
maybe it was the upturned collar , the puffed - out chest or the sheer arrogance of the man , but he seemed to view the football pitch as a stage , his stage , and performed accordingly			0
the @entity220 scored goals with the air of an artist applying the final brushstroke to a masterpiece			0
@entity6 hero @entity208 slots home against rivals @entity55 at @entity228 in 1993 1			2
@entity96 1 - 2 @entity52 , 30 september 2006 a sublime left - footed volley from @entity231 's cross gave the @entity205 all three points at the @entity233			0
@entity6 3 - 0 @entity112 , 22 april 2013 @entity123 was the provider as his lifted through ball dropped onto @entity128 's left boot for him to crash home from the edge of the box			1
it was his second goal of a hat - trick as @entity6 sealed the @entity24 title			1
@entity52 3 - 0 @entity243 , 26 november 2006 a fine individual run from the @entity113 ended with a brilliant curling effort beyond @entity246 late in the game			2
@entity52 1 - 0 @entity154 , 10 december 2011 latching on to a perfect ball over the top from @entity250 , @entity5 smashed a first - time volley past @entity252 to give the @entity205 a hard - fought win			1
@entity254 3 - 5 @entity52 , 29 october 2011 @entity128 sealed his hat - trick and an emphatic win a @entity257 with an unstoppable strike beyond @entity259 and into the top corner			2
