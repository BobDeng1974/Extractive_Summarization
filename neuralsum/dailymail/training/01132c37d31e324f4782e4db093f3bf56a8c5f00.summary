attempts were made on wednesday to dismiss @entity3 ’s astonishing @entity2 row with @entity5 ’s second best distance runner as a juvenile exchange between two athletes who really should know better			1
others , however , saw it as the moment @entity11 allowed his mask to slip ; when we were suddenly given a view of the double @entity17 champion that those around him have long tried to conceal			1
@entity18 does need to take some responsibility for provoking the runner he finished second to in last summer ’s @entity23 10,000m final			1
he has a bit of form for being outspoken on social media and he questioned the quality of the field assembled for @entity11 ’s attempt at the world indoor two mile record in @entity32 this weekend , suggesting it was not a proper race and branding it a ‘ joke ’			1
@entity3 ( right ) and @entity18 , who finished one - two at the @entity37 , have clashed in a @entity2 stoush that has seen many in athletics offended by @entity11 's comments @entity11 celebrates his victory over @entity43 for the men 's 10,000m @entity45 titles in @entity47 in august 2014 but the response shocked even @entity43 , who suddenly found himself being publicly branded an ‘ embarrassment ’ and someone @entity51 would beat			1
‘ @entity55 , ’ @entity11 added , which was probably the remark that offended the wider athletics community most			1
on wednesday @entity18 summed up the feelings of all those athletes who strive to be successful in the absence of the incredible talent @entity11 possesses			1
‘ if he thinks i am an embarrassment , then what does he think about the rest of us ? ’ said @entity18			1
‘ it came across very arrogant from him			2
’ others were just as offended			0
one @entity67 told me @entity11 had ‘ crossed a line ’			1
another said @entity11 had been ‘ hugely disrespectful to fellow athletes ’			1
@entity43 is a major championship medallist after all ; a national cross-country champion too			0
decent ? ‘ i feel it ’s harsh on everyone else , ’ added @entity18			1
it ’s certainly harsh on @entity43 , when he trains every bit as hard as @entity11 but just lacks that bit of quality that separates the very best from the very good			1
over the past five years he has earned between £ 15,000 and £ 20,000 a year in pursuit of the two @entity45 medals he won in @entity47 last summer			0
he has had to do other jobs to make ends meet and now has a stake in a refurbishment company			0
his earnings amount to a fraction of the money @entity11 commands			1
@entity11 will make more on saturday than @entity43 earns in a year			1
finding anyone brave enough to discuss a situation that embarrassed the sport proved difficult			0
@entity11 ’s representatives did not respond to messages while his sponsors at @entity98 said they did not comment on the ‘ personal accounts ’ of their athletes			1
they might pay @entity11 a fortune to inspire people to buy their running shoes but the moment he rubbished the efforts of all runners out there pounding the streets they essentially ran for cover			2
@entity111 declined to comment too			0
so credit to @entity113 , one time 5,000m world record holder and former @entity111 chief executive , for giving his view and recognising that this needs to be addressed when it can be damaging , not just to a @entity120 sporting icon but to @entity120 sport			0
these days @entity113 is a central figure in trying to inspire people to participate in sport			0
he is the director of sport for the @entity17 legacy project , @entity125			0
he was dismayed by the row between two athletes he has known since they were competing as youngsters			2
@entity18 tweeted that the field running with @entity11 in his bid for an indoor world record in @entity32 was a joke the response ‘ @entity135 ’ from @entity11 offended many in athletics ‘ for me it highlights the danger of @entity2 and social media , ’ said @entity113			1
‘ neither of them should be disrespecting the other			0
they should concentrate on running			0
’ @entity113 said he winced at @entity11 ’s comments			1
‘ yes , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve watched them grow up and i ’m proud of how well they ’ve done			0
@entity3 ’s got nothing to prove			2
i would n’t care if my granny was against him			0
he ’s still a joy to watch			0
’ as @entity18 said , it is no secret that races are sometimes organised to give the paying punters what they want			2
in this case a @entity11 victory and the @entity160 celebration they all like to mimic			2
saturday ’s race is one @entity11 should win , given the field will be populated by a 40 - year - old @entity164 and runners only strong enough to either act as pacemakers or also - rans			1
but it will not be easy when his objective is to set his first world record			0
@entity18 might have overlooked that point but @entity11 also ignored the fact that his rival had only just returned to running after serious injury when he teased him for failing to secure a place in the race			1
curiously there does not appear to be any history of spats between them			0
@entity43 has a picture of him with @entity11 after their @entity45 triumph on his @entity185 and @entity2 pages , and in @entity47 last summer they would dine together			1
there is no history of spats between @entity5 's two best male long distance runners @entity11 will earn more than @entity43 does in a year when he runs in @entity32 this weekend but some observers have noted a change in @entity11 in recent years			1
if he was delighted to celebrate with team - mate @entity194 after a @entity45 one - two at 10,000m in 2010 , there seemed a reluctance on @entity11 ’s part to pose for photographs with @entity43 in @entity47			2
after such extraordinary levels of success since that breakthrough season five years ago , it certainly looked like @entity11 was no longer prepared to share the limelight			2
if true , it will not necessarily be because he is being badly advised			0
his representatives look after @entity204 and he is a media dream			0
but some who know @entity11 would say he has not coped so well with life in the spotlight , responding with arrogance and aggression when he needs to recognise that with fame comes responsibility as well as the kind of attention he often seems to resent			2
he can be difficult to handle , sometimes even throwing the occasional tantrum			0
it has been noted that it may not help that his wife , @entity218 , takes care of some of his pr when the emotional attachment she obviously has can cloud her judgment			0
on wednesday it was suggested she sometimes tweets for her husband			0
in fact , journalists once asked @entity11 about something he had tweeted after a race			2
‘ did i say that ? ’ he asked , completely oblivious to what was on his @entity2 page			2
on friday , in @entity32 , he will be asked about the comments made this week			1
the important thing now is how he responds .			0

@entity18 and @entity3 engaged in a spat on @entity2 this week
@entity18 labelled the field against @entity11 this weeked in @entity32 a joke
@entity11 called the runner who finished second to him in the @entity37 ' an embarrassment '
many in the wider athletics community found @entity11 's comments arrogant
somehow pop star @entity51 got roped into the argument with both athletes *quoting* *lyrics* from the @entity252 's hit song ' @entity253 '
