by @entity1 correspondent published : 14:45 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 24 september 2013 lord @entity3 's @entity2 say the @entity5 's predictions are biased the @entity5 ’s global warming predictions are flawed and could result in millions of pounds being squandered , it is claimed			1
a report for a think tank led by former @entity10 chancellor @entity3 says a computer programme behind figures that shape climate change policy is biased in favour of higher temperatures			1
large sums of public and private sector money could be ‘ malinvested ’ in everything from wind farms to heat - proof road surfaces as a result , it claims			1
@entity3 , chairman of the @entity2 , said : ‘ the government ’s policy of abandoning cheap conventional energy and moving to expensive ( and unreliable ) renewable energy has always been of dubious merit			2
' the fact that it now emerges this policy has been based on projections by a computer model which has been found to be fatally flawed means that an independent expert review of the model and its projections is both essential and urgent			2
’ the claim , hotly disputed by the @entity5 , comes as scientists and officials meet in @entity38 to finalise a major report by the @entity40 ’ @entity41			1
experts claim the think tank timed its report to undermine the @entity41 , which is expected to say the case for man - made global warming is stronger than ever			0
the report attacks @entity48 , a programme used to predict the effect of carbon dioxide levels			1
squandered : millions of pounds of public money could be wrongly invested into wind farms and other renewable energy sources , the report claims it says there is a glitch in the way it factors in the impact of low - lying cloud , with estimates of small temperature rises adjusted upwards			0
report author @entity64 said : ‘ the @entity66 ’s official climate predictions are therefore unreliable and excessively alarmist			0
‘ the problem is highly technical but its implications are that the model , as currently used , will always provide high estimates of future warming			0
’ however , the @entity5 said it is confident in @entity48			2
it said it uses data from many models , and the figures are independently reviewed			0
@entity76 , a climate change expert at the @entity78 , said : ‘ this is a political stunt by @entity3 ’s @entity2 to try to distract attention from the @entity41 report			1
rejected : the @entity5 strongly dispute the report and add that they have confidence in the computer programme behind their predictions - @entity48 ‘ the @entity5 climate model is based on the best available scientific evidence and expert judgment			1
’ drafts of the @entity41 report – the first in six years – say it is at least 95 per cent certain human activity is the main cause of temperature rises since the 1950s			0
that is up from 90 per cent in 2007 , and 66 per cent in 2001			0
the assessment will be used by governments worldwide to set policy .			0
