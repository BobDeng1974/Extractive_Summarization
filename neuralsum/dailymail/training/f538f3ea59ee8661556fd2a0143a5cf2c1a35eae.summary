it is not the obscene prospect of the £ 500,000 - a - week player which most blatantly exposes the moral bankruptcy of big - time football in this country			1
it is the reluctance of all but one of the @entity10 clubs to pay all the rest of their staff a living wage			1
even as he was announcing the sale of three seasons of @entity19 television rights for @entity10 matches for more than £ 5billion , chief executive @entity15 brazenly defended the right of his clubs to pay lesser workers £ 6.50 an hour			1
@entity23 is on an eye - watering £ 285,000 a week during his loan spell at @entity26 with the new tv deal , players at the level of @entity29 could be on £ 500,000 a week by 2020 no he is ‘ not uncomfortable ’ with the clubs he is enriching beyond @entity33 keeping some employees on that bare legal minimum rather than the @entity19 living wage of £ 7.85 an hour , rising to £ 9.15 in @entity31			1
nor , by inference , does @entity15 regard it as a ‘ disgrace ’ that so many cleaners of dressing rooms , sweepers of terraces and pourers of tea earn £ 284,772.50 less for a 35 - hour week than the £ 285,000 which is the reported salary of @entity23 for making intermittent appearances with @entity26			1
once this new tv deal is boosted above £ 8bn by the placement of overseas broadcasting rights , @entity49 ’s wage packet is expected to be eclipsed by the first half - a - million - pounds - a - week ball - kickers			1
even though that may appear grotesque in relation to the ordinary ability and average achievements of the @entity10 ’s over-rated celebrities , good luck to them			2
@entity10 chief executive @entity15 at the announcement of the bumper package this week but not at the impoverishing expense of those who clear up after them			1
@entity65 take a great deal of flak these days – not least their manager @entity68 – but in this issue they are setting an example which should embarrass their 19 @entity10 rivals			1
@entity65 alone have contracted to meet , at least , the basic demand of the @entity73			1
while @entity79 have agreed to pay the living wage to staff they employ directly , though not contract workers , others like @entity75 , who charge the most in the land for season tickets , simply ignore the outrage			1
nor can @entity15 guarantee that the rise in television revenues – now up to an astonishing £ 10m per match – will bring about the reduction in admission prices for which supporters are campaigning			1
‘ not all the clubs make a profit , ’ he bleats			2
well , if they do n’t they have only themselves to blame for paying their players – and worse still their agents – way too much			0
and when @entity15 protests that ‘ the fans want the best talent to come and play in the @entity10 ’ he conveniently forgets that @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and others of the world ’s creme - de - la - creme prefer to ply their trade abroad			1
actually , that makes his negotiation of the new tv deal all the more remarkable , especially in the eyes of ‘ my 20 employers			2
’ hence his own salary and bonus package amounts to around £ 2m a year			2
and now they are considering promoting to executive chairman this man who , less than a year ago , was facing widespread demands that he be sacked for ‘ sexually inappropriate ’ texting			0
quite how the toilet cleaners at the @entity118 feel about that they have yet to tell us but @entity15 says : ‘ like in the film and pop industry the absolute talent get paid a disproportionately high amount			2
’ of course he is right when he says : ‘ we ’re in the entertainment business			0
’ @entity99 , the world 's best player , left the @entity10 for @entity126 six years ago the @entity10 is not so much a sporting competition as a circus with , yes , we the media as one of its three rings generating much of the manically excessive hype			1
hence this mega-bucks deal which will feed its own greed and never mind that it will further weaken our feeble @entity138 team by financing the import of yet more foreign footballers			0
but what about this industry ’s more lowly workers ? says @entity15 : ‘ there is a thing called the living wage			1
then there is a minimum wage which the politicians have the power to raise , which is not for us to do			0
’ one of those politicians , shadow @entity31 minister @entity153 , calls his remarks ‘ disgraceful			0
’ he exhorts the @entity10 clubs to lift their most lowly - paid staff onto the living wage ‘ so they can put food on the table and pay the rent			1
’ food for thought , also ? only the morally bankrupt would think not			0
because whether it be mr @entity15 or the majority of his 20 paymasters , somebody should be feeling ashamed about that			2
@entity68 is in his element in the spotlight			0
@entity171 was like a rabbit caught in the headlights			0
two more examples of why , in the lead article to this column , i refer to the @entity10 as a circus			2
@entity68 , as one of the ringmasters , not only survives but prospers at @entity65 because he meets controversy – like the @entity182 non-biting incident at wednesday ’s evening performance – with outraged indignation			2
@entity68 plays his role to perfection - performing for the gallery and preparing to be champion @entity171 is out of a job after his reign as @entity191 manager was brought to an end on wednesday night @entity171 suffers pain , torment and humiliation at @entity191 , which is invariably the miserable lot of circus animals			0
one plays to a captivated gallery and prepares to be anointed , once again , as a champion			0
the other shrivels in the glare and is hounded out			0
it is the way of the beast some accuse @entity207 of long - ball tactics			0
others criticise @entity26 ’s manager for playing @entity211 too deep , in midfield			0
if both are true , no wonder his expensive ensemble are struggling , by - passing your best player – which is the @entity218 , not the @entity219 – is not a very good idea			0
hold on a minute , is that @entity211 playing as a defensive midfielder for @entity26 ? @entity26 boss @entity207 has been under the spotlight for using @entity211 in a deeper role than he 's used to			0

only @entity65 contracted to meet demand of the @entity73
@entity79 agree to it for staff they employ directly
@entity10 @entity19 tv rights sold for £ *5bn* for three seasons
@entity15 defended right of clubs to pay workers £ 6.50 an hour
we could see a player on £ 500,000 a week by 2020
