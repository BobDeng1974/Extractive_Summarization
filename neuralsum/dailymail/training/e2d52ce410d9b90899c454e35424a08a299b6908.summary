@entity1 players set off for the @entity2 in @entity3 on sunday night but doubts still linger over the @entity7 side 's participation because of a pay dispute			1
wanderers players from their weekend loss to @entity11 left @entity1 bound for northern @entity12 after initial suggestions the group may not travel			1
the issue stems from the club 's offer to pay players just 10 per cent share of the minimum $ us1million ( $ a1.2m ) they made for qualifying for the tournament			1
@entity23 players react after their team lost to @entity25 on saturday			2
now the players are of to @entity3 for the @entity2 but there 's doubt over whether they 'll play because of a pay dispute there 's doubt over whether @entity1 players ( pictured in white ) will participate in the @entity2 due to a pay dispute a spokesperson for the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) said the players left for @entity3 as a ' sign of good faith ' and were essentially allowing the club some more time to come to the table			1
the footballers are seeking 50 per cent of any money made from the tournament , in line with what had been negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement ( @entity48 )			1
the sticking point with the club is that the wording of the agreement only extends to the @entity53 - a point the @entity36 steadfastly argued against in a statement on sunday night			1
' in the course of these negotiations , the club made it clear to the players that its interpretation of the @entity48 was that the obligation to share 50 per cent of prize money did not apply to the @entity2 , ' @entity36 chief executive @entity56 wrote			1
' the club has insisted on sharing only 10 per cent of its guaranteed payment of us $ 1,000,000 with the players , a percentage which is without precedent			2
' this technical interpretation by the club defeats the letter as well as the spirit and intent of the @entity48			0
' @entity23 players ( pictured in white ) are disputing their pay at the @entity2			2
the club is offering them 10 % of the share they made for qualifying for the tournament while the players want 50 % while the @entity36 is hopeful of bringing wanderers officials to the bargaining table in the coming days - the side 's first match of the @entity88 is against @entity90 champions @entity89 on december 13 - the @entity1 sign is expected to struggle in @entity3 regardless			1

shots : 26 - 1			0
possession : 80 per cent to 20 per cent			0
passes : 786 to 210			0
the wanderers were joined on the losers ' list by the other @entity112 clubs - each losing on home soil			0
@entity114 fell victims to a late @entity117 comeback to lose 2 - 1			0
@entity118 scored three goals in 11 minutes to defeat @entity120 , before the @entity121 put @entity122 to the sword with three goals in six minutes			0
capping the round , @entity125 earned their first home win as a re-branded side , in a lacklustre 1 - 0 result over @entity130 .			0

there 's doubt over whether *western* @entity1 players will participate in the @entity2 due to a pay dispute
wanderers players took a *flight* to @entity3 sunday night as a ' sign of good faith '
it stems from the club 's offer to pay players just 10 % share of the minimum $ 1.2 million for qualifying
the footballers want 50 % of any money made from the tournament
