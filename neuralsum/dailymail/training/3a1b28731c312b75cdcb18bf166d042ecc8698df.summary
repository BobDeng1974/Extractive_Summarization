by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:51 est , 28 february 2014 @entity4 ’s toxic smog finally lifted this week with dramatic before and after pictures taken on wednesday and thursday showing just how dense it had been			1
a strong cold front brought blue sky and sunshine to a city that had been masked by dense pollution for over a week			1
earlier this week @entity13 scientists said that pollution in @entity4 was so dense that its effects were comparable to that of a nuclear winter			1
remarkable : the above photograph was taken near the @entity19 in @entity4 on wednesday and the lower one at the same place on thursday relief : blue sky and sunshine reappeared in @entity4 on thursday thanks to a strong cold front which dispersed the week - long smoggy weather it has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated , so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply			1
this process was under way in @entity13 ’s capital city and six northern provinces , according to @entity36 from @entity38 ’s @entity37 and @entity39			2
she warned that the toxic smog was hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer , it could affect food production , according to @entity45			2
clear skies : the photo on the left shows the sharp contrast of air quality at the @entity51 while on the right , software on a mobile phone indicates the sharp contrast in pollution levels the sun is finally revealed : the corner tower of the @entity19 on wednesday and thursday ( left ) and before and after shots of the @entity60 that show the beneficial effect of the cold weather front @entity36 demonstrated recently that seedlings in @entity4 were taking over twice as long to grow as those in a lab. ‘ every farm is caught in a smog panic , ’ she told the @entity67			1
pollution had been so severe that aircraft were grounded , roads closed and tourists numbers hit , while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the @entity76 , whose readings in @entity4 on tuesday had alarming results			1
it was reported that the level of @entity83 particles , a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream , reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre , far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe , which is 25			2
authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased			0
@entity4 had been draped in stinking smog for more than a week and in an effort to cut pollution , 147 industrial companies in the capital had cut or suspended production as of tuesday , according to @entity102			1
city residents are growing angry and alarmed			0
‘ of course , on days where pollution levels reach or even exceed the scale , we are very concerned and we have to see this as a crisis , ’ @entity104 , the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) representative in @entity13 , told @entity106			0
road to nowhere : vehicles clog a highway in @entity4 on wednesday as a hazardous smog enveloped the city ‘ there 's now clear evidence that , in the long term , high levels of air pollution can actually also cause lung cancer , ’ he said			1
@entity123 , a major industrial region surrounding @entity4 , has some of the most polluted cities in the world 's most populous country			1
@entity127 routinely recorded ‘ beyond index ’ measurements of polluting ‘ particulate matter ’ in early 2013			0
the @entity131 identified the province as a major source of noxious smog that hung over @entity4 a year ago			1
the government said in an action plan for @entity123 in september that it would ban new projects in certain industries , close outdated steel and cement facilities and slash coal use			0
the province has promised to cut total steel capacity by 86 million tonnes , about 40 percent of last year 's production , by 2020			0
official data suggests that is starting to happen			0
meanwhile , a man in a smog - ridden northern city has become the first person in @entity13 to sue the government for failing to curb air pollution			1
@entity153 , a resident of @entity127 , capital of the northern province of @entity123 , submitted his complaint to a district court asking the city 's @entity158 to ‘ perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law ’ , the @entity152 said			2
the @entity163 recently ranked @entity4 second worst in terms of living environment among 40 major cities around the world and said it was ' barely suitable ' for living			2
however , @entity13 's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country 's awful @entity173 smog , he says , provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry			0
rear admiral @entity178 , a military expert at the @entity179 , spoke days after it was reported that the @entity181 planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the @entity186			0
he said lasers were ' most afraid of smog ' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired			0
' under conditions where there is no smog , a laser weapon can fire ( at a range of ) 10 kilometres , ' he told @entity198 ’s @entity197 ( cross-straits ) current affairs program , according to @entity201 there ’s smog , it ’s only one kilometre			0
what 's the point of making this kind of weapon ? '			0
