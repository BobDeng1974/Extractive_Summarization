by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 10 april 2013 @entity2 : 05:56 est , 10 april 2013 these stunning images show natural waterfall landscapes transformed into vibrant rainbows of colour			0
the other - worldy pictures are created by clever use of long exposure photography and glow sticks floating through water			1
the @entity13 series is the brainchild of @entity15 , 19 , and @entity16 , 20 , a photography duo based in @entity17			0
photographers @entity15 and @entity16 used glow sticks to illuminate the natural scenery of waterfalls in northern @entity17 to give them an eerie glow @entity23 : long exposure photography was used to capture the results of glow sticks floating through waterfalls in the @entity28 northern lights : the @entity13 series was created by young photographers @entity15 and @entity16 , aged just 19 and 20 in the north of @entity17 mr @entity16 , originally from @entity32 , explains : ‘ this project came from months of refining a simple idea that finally turned into a concept worthy of using for an entire series			1
’ we were both fascinated by artificial light such as glow sticks , lasers , flares , and being big on landscape photography we tied them together in hopes of creating something that we had never seen before			0
the photographers would not fully disclose how they achieved the haunting images such as this ripple effect in the @entity13 collection @entity15 and @entity16 used exposures varying from 30 seconds to seven minutes to create the effects ’ although we are not giving out the details as to how we did everything in the images we will disclose that they are long exposures taken between 30s and 7m of different landscapes where one person is standing at the drop point , strategically placing glow sticks in the right areas to flow into the frame of the image , while the other person is manning the camera and catching the glow sticks as they leave the frame			1
the duo say they are so pleased with the results they wish to expand the idea of bringing artificial colour to natural landscapes			0
’ although this series was meant to focus mostly on glow sticks in waterfalls , we are exploring the idea of creating artificially lit landscapes in general as well , such as mountains , lakes , tree lines , grass fields and caves , ’ mr @entity16 added			2
seeing red : @entity16 said he and his colleague @entity15 were both fascinated by artificial light such as glow sticks , lasers , and flares @entity16 said he and @entity15 were considering photographing other artificially lit landscapes such as mountains , lakes , tree lines , grass fields and caves			2
