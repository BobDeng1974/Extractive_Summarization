sore : @entity8 's hooves will need special treatment for the rest of his life , after they curled up at the ends happy : the eight - year - old , pictured with volunteer @entity27 , 14 , was nursed back to health at @entity29 his hooves had grown to six inches long and curled upwards , which would have hurt as much as trapping a hand in a car door , a vet said			1
it took a year to get @entity8 back down to a normal weight , and his hooves will need specialist treatment for the rest of his life			1
on a scale of one to five , where five is morbidly obese , @entity8 ’s weight was ranked a four by the charity , who helped to rehabilitate him			1
@entity42 , equine training manager for @entity16 , said : ' bingo was in a sorry state when he was rescued by @entity16			2
cruel : horses ' hooves should be regularly trimmed - but @entity8 's were left to grow to six inches long ' it took months of remedial trimming and painkillers to bring his hooves back to a relatively normal and pain - free state			1
' @entity53 from @entity16 , who owns two @entity19 ponies of her own , said : ' the vet said that his hooves would have been causing him as much pain as trapping a hand in a car door			1
he was still making his way around on them but he would have been in excruciating pain			0
' @entity19 ponies are easy to look after			1
they are adapted to live in @entity19 where grass is sparse			1
if they are left in a healthy field here , they will literally eat themselves to death			0
' i have an electric fence that i move a little bit each day to stop mine over-eating , but @entity8 was just left , which is how he got so fat			1
' malformed : the @entity19 pony 's hooves would have hurt as much as a hand trapped in a car door @entity8 ’s hooves were so bad when he was found in july 2011 that the tissue had broken down and the bone had moved			1
he has his hooves trimmed every four weeks to try and get the bone back to a normal position			1
a regular horse would need their hooves trimming every six to eight weeks			2
@entity8 ’s owners were successfully prosecuted in january 2012 and were banned from keeping any animal for two years , except dogs , fish and chicken			1
@entity16 volunteer @entity27 , 14 , has struck up a friendship with @entity8			1
she said : ' when i met bingo i thought he was quite cute - he ’s a cuddly little thing , but he ’s got a cheeky side too			2
i often catch him sticking his nose in my pockets to see if i ’ve got any treats			0
' his favourite is hay - i sometimes sneak him big handfuls when i know that no - one ’s looking			2
' i used to work with a horse called @entity112 and we got on really well , but she had to be put down a few months ago			0
it ’s nice that i now have @entity8 to keep me company instead			2
' bingo is now fully rehabilitated and helping with @entity118 at @entity16			0
the courses provide first - hand experiences of working with horses for children and young people			2
@entity27 was encouraged by her mother to start a six - week discovery course at the charity , and was then asked to stay on as a volunteer			2
' i was a bit shy when i started going to @entity16 , but after a few weeks i got really into it , ' she said			0
' it was like the horses read my mind			0
they take all the negativity out of you			0
' @entity137 help kids that are having problems because they have been through hard times as well , so it sort of cheers them up and you can repay them			0
' i already liked animals so this helped it along			0
i would like to carry on as a volunteer at @entity16 and help support others			0
i would love to have my own farm one day			0

ms @entity150 said : ' many of the young people that have taken part in the @entity118 have been able to return to mainstream schooling , or have gone on to college courses , something which would previously have been out of the question for them			0
' our future hopes are to secure enough funding to be able to help everybody who applies for the courses			0
