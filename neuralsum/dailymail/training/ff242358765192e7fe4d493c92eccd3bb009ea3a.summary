by @entity0 cancer - fighting cells harvested from a mother - of - six have been used to fight the tumours invading her body - a treatment hailed by doctors as a ' blueprint for treating the disease '			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was diagnosed with a rare bile duct cancer on her son 's 14th birthday in december 2009			1
doctors warned the 45 - year - old she had just months to live			1
but experts at the @entity18 in the @entity19 have developed a new treatment , hailed as a ' blueprint for fighting cancer ' , successfully shrinking mrs @entity9 's tumours by a quarter			1
@entity9 , from @entity11 in the @entity19 was diagnosed with a rare form of bile duct cancer in december 2009 the mother - of - six was given just months to live			1
when a course of powerful chemotherapy failed to shrink her tumours , mrs @entity9 researched her options on the internet , stumbling across a trial that was taking place at the @entity33 in @entity34 the case , reported in the journal @entity37 , involved experts harvesting mrs @entity40 's own immune cells - those which were identified as having the right tools to attack the tumours			1
the cells were then replicated in the laboratory , and implanted back into mrs @entity9 's body			1
they have now been attacking and shrinking her tumour for the last six months			0
' it 's the first time we have been able to actually target a specific mutation in the immune system , ' dr @entity48 told @entity53			2
' it represents a blueprint for how to do this			0
it is a new method for potentially attacking any kind of cancer			0
' while her hair is now growing back and she is once again chasing around after her three youngest children , mrs @entity9 is realistic - she still has cancer			1
when her disease came to light , cancer was not on mrs @entity9 's radar , she said			1
doctors were carrying out tests to detect gallstones and found a mass in her liver			0
after breaking the news , medics started the 45 - year - old on a course of chemotherapy , which damaged the nerves in her ears , hands and feet			1
but the treatment failed to shrink her tumours			2
researching the options available to her , mrs @entity9 found details of a trial taking place at the @entity33			1
the 45 - year - old , pictured with her husband and six children , became the first patient to have her own immune cells harvested from her body , grown in a lab and implanted back into her body to fight the disease mrs @entity9 's tumours have now shrunk by around 25 per cent , since undergoing the pioneering new treatment , hailed by the team behind it as a ' blueprint for treating cancer ' she signed up and started treatment in march 2012			1
the study centres on immune cells known as @entity104 t - cells , which can detect cancer cells and in some cases destroy the disease			1
the process of cancer immunotherapy , has for years , tried to pinpoint those t - cells and replicate them for patients			2
dr @entity48 said it has been difficult to perform the process in epithelial cancers - solid tumours which account for around 80 per cent of all cancers			2
but he said recent advances in genetic sequencing have meant it is now more likely to be successful			0
his team removed a tumour from mrs @entity9 's left lung , and managed to extract the t - cells found attacking the disease			1
over the course of a month , the experts nurtured the cells , growing them in a lab. a powerful bout of chemotherapy was then prescribed to kill off any other immune cells , working within mrs @entity9 's body			1
once the chemotherapy was complete , the t - cells were implanted			1
bile duct cancer affects around 2,500 people in the @entity19 and another 1,000 people in the @entity138 each year there are only around 2,500 new cases of cholangiocarinoma diagnosed each year in the @entity19 and a further 1,000 in the @entity138			1
the five - year relative survival rate for early stage cases of the disease is only about 30 per cent			2
bile ducts are tubes that carry bile			0
the main function of bile is to break down fats in food to help our digestion			0
@entity154 is made by the liver and stored in the gall bladder			0
the bile ducts connect the liver to the gall bladder			0
the cause of most bile duct cancers is unknown			2
a number of conditions , including the chronic inflammatory bowel condition ulcerative colitis can increase a person 's risk of developing cancer			2
those born with congenital abnormalities of the bile ducts , such as choledochal cysts , also have a higher risk of developing the rare cancer			2
in @entity176 and @entity177 bile duct cancers are thought to be caused by an infection caused by a parasite known as the liver fluke			2
the disease can strike at any age , but more than two in three cases occur in those aged over 65 years old			0
cancer in the bile ducts causes the tubes to block , prohibiting the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines			0
it causes the bile to seep back into the blood causing a person to become jaundice - their skin and whites of their eyes become yellow			0
other symptoms include abdominal discomfort , a loss of appetite , high temperatures and weight loss			0
source : @entity210 for six months the tumours shrank , and for the next six months they stablised			0
but as the cancer mutated , the disease started to grow again			0
by this time dr @entity48 and his team had managed to develop a technique to map the tumour and find the mutations			0
after stringing together all the mutated dna , the scientists tested it against a sample of their patient 's t - cells - a feat that would not have been possible were it not for the new high - throughput genome sequencing technique			2
the team found the precise t - cells that could attack the tumours and once again cultivated them in the lab before implanting them back into mrs @entity9 's body			1
for the last six months her tumours have once again been shrinking in size			0
she added : ' when i went into this trial i felt like i had nothing to lose but everything to gain			0
' ' life definitely does nâ€™t stop because you have cancer , ' she said .			0

@entity9 was diagnosed with bile duct cancer in december 2009
mother - of - six 's first round of chemotherapy failed to shrink her tumours
she researched her options and signed up to a new trial in @entity34
45 - year - old 's own immune cells were harvested from her body
the @entity104 t - cells , fight the disease but are often *overwhelmed*
scientists replicated mrs @entity9 's t - cells and implanted them in her body
her tumours have since shrunk by around 25 per cent
expert hails the treatment a ' blueprint for treating the disease '
