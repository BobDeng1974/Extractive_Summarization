this time a year ago he was a welcome ray of sunlight in a dark winter of discontent for @entity3			1
with pressure growing on @entity5 the form of @entity7 was one of few reasons to be cheerful for the sing - as - they - suffered @entity10 faithful			1
as the under - fire @entity13 searched for a winning formula ( sound familiar ? ) the youngster signed from @entity16 in 2011 for £ 300,0000 , was one of only two players to play every game last january			2
@entity7 ( right ) has fallen down the pecking order at @entity3 under @entity21 @entity7 ( left , with @entity22 last week ) is expected to be sent out on loan this transfer window @entity7 has gone from being a central player at @entity3 to a peripheral figure in less than a year			1
2013 - 2014 appearances : 35 goals : 4 2014 - 2015 appearances : 11 goals : 0 the 2013 reserve team player of the year had earlier announced himself with a winning brace in a 2 - 1 win at @entity33			1
born in @entity36 to @entity39 - @entity38 parents , almost immediately a tug - of - war over his international allegiance was underway			2
@entity40 declared an interest and @entity3 , wary of similar competition among rival clubs , quickly jumped in with a five - year contract			1
officials at @entity46 had serious concerns he may go the same way as @entity49 , who jumped ship to @entity51 to much dismay			0
@entity7 signed on the dotted line , pledged his allegiance to @entity36 and seemed to get better and better			2
at the end of the season he could look back with pride on making 35 appearances , despite @entity3 's annus horribilis , and look forward to a place in the @entity62 ' much - fancied squad at the @entity63			1
@entity7 ( left ) scores his second goal of the game for @entity3 in the 2 - 1 win over @entity33 last season @entity7 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring the winning goal against @entity33 @entity5 ( left ) and @entity70 ( right ) congratulate the manager after his performance against @entity33 then @entity21 arrived at @entity46 and it all changed			1
this season he has started and finished just two games			0
at the last count he has 27 minutes under his belt since the first week in november			1
some have even claimed that he only stood out last term because he was in such a poor team and reckon his new teacher is not impressed			0
they are wrong and there is mitigation			0
@entity84 , armed with an open chequebook , paid a @entity87 record £ 59.7million for @entity88			0
the seemingly - immovable @entity89 is now being deployed in midfield			0
@entity91 is shining behind the strikers			0
it is a tough line to get to the front of			0
@entity84 's preference for a three - man defence , with the added creativity deploying two wing backs brings , has also damaged the young playmaker 's chances			0
and nobody would rule against further big - money arrivals in the summer – chief executive @entity103 has hinted at it more than once			0
as reported by @entity105 , @entity7 is now expected to depart on loan during this transfer window			1
@entity7 ( left ) has only played 27 minutes of football this season under @entity21 @entity7 , pictured here playing for the @entity110 , has only made two top - flight starts this season so where next ? @entity5 remains a keen admirer			1
in a recent interview with four four two magazine the former @entity3 boss , rebuilding his career with @entity118 , compared @entity7 with @entity119 , no less			1
the teenager may well be tempted to rid himself of that sinking feeling on the @entity123 coast and @entity5 has already revealed he will attempt to borrow reinforcements this month			1
a less physical competition such as @entity126 , along with the increased time on the ball it allows , may well suit a player not noted for his physical presence			0
@entity84 has always been keen on promoting from within and nurturing youth from his early days as a coach			0
@entity21 has told @entity3 chief executive @entity103 that @entity7 is not in his current plans but he has also shown he is not afraid of getting rid of homegrown talent to @entity137 rivals – just ask @entity138			1
and in @entity140 there are likely to be other suitors			0
@entity142 are known to be admirers and the chance to link up with @entity36 team - mates @entity145 and @entity147 may well turn the youngsters head			2
a switch to @entity150 may also get the thumbs up from @entity3 pal @entity152			2
the pair are inseparable and @entity22 will no doubt relay fondly tales of his time on @entity156 although he too will sing @entity5 ' praises			2
@entity158 ( left , in action against @entity160 on tuesday ) is a target for @entity3 for @entity3 , thought to be monitoring @entity158 , lending @entity7 to @entity162 may well go a long way to opening doors at @entity142 in their pursuit of the @entity166 right back further down the line			1
wherever he goes , if he does at all ( and knowing @entity3 's luck with injuries this season that is always subject to change ) , he will need to impress			2
what a difference a year makes .			0

@entity7 is expected to leave @entity3 on loan this month
the 19 - year - old has played 27 minutes of first - team football this season
under @entity5 last season he shone and made 35 appearances
