at first glace , the ' @entity0 ' looks like an abstract work of art. but a closer look at this @entity5 printed vase reveals hidden faces in its outline , or ' negative space '			1
the vase was the brainchild of @entity12 , a designer from @entity13 , who was asked to create an unusual gift for his wife on @entity16			1
' i know , i also could have just gotten a card			0
but i 've continued to play around with the program over the last few months and eventually we kind of wanted to take it out for a test drive			0
' when his wife , @entity20 , received the gift , she noticed that by gazing into the negative space she could see the faces of her children herself , and her husband			1
the profiles of mrs @entity39 ' children appear on opposite sides of the negative space as the vase - or ' @entity0 ' - rotates , and these slowly transform into the profiles of @entity44 and mrs @entity39			1
the ‘ @entity0 ’ vases were created using photos of mr @entity48 's family			0
the concept came about when @entity12 , a designer from @entity13 , was asked to create an unusual gift for his wife on @entity16			1
pictured is the outline of @entity12 ( right ) and his wife , @entity20 ( left ) he then isolated their outlines and used software to find out something known as ‘ vector geometry ’ which brought the profiles to life in negative space			1
in art , negative space is the area around and between the subject of an image			2
it becomes evident when the space around a subject , rather than the subject itself , reveals a hidden shape			2
artists , such as @entity75 , use negative space to draw attention to make conceptual and surreal paintings			2
perhaps the most famous example is a vase , but other notable example include the key that shows the image of a skyline and the lady that appears in the shadow of a saxophone player			0
‘ most images taken from the side will work , although higher contrast images produce more predictable results , ’ said mr @entity12 in his @entity89 site			2
‘ the outlines from the photos become the scaffolding for a 3d model that merges the distinct profiles into a seamless sculptural form			0
’ under the banner @entity102 , the inventor now wants to use the funds from his @entity89 campaign to buy a 3d printer to produce more @entity106 ’			1
' the first step is to get our hands on that 3d printer , ' he said			0
' then the real fun can begin			0
' @entity20 and my background designing high quality bespoke spaces for real people makes us extremely curious about the potential of new technologies to create a new type of bespoke design			0
' the idea can start with a vase , but the potential is much greater			0
' the profiles of mrs @entity39 ' children appear on opposite sides of the negative space as the vase - or ' @entity0 ' - rotates , and these slowly transform into the profiles of @entity44 and mrs @entity39			1

@entity106 is the creation of @entity12 , a designer from @entity13
the faces can be seen in the outline of the vase - or ' negative space '
the inventor is now *hoping* to raise *$* *10,000* ( *£* *6,600* ) on @entity89
