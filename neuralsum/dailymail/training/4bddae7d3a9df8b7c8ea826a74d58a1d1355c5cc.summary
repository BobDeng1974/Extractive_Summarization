by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 10 april 2013 hundreds of thousands of people could struggle to watch @entity3 television programmes next week because of tests to assess the impact of new @entity7 mobile phone networks			1
at least 170,000 households and businesses in southeast @entity10 are being warned their digital tv signal could be disrupted on monday because of the trial			1
they could lose some or all @entity3 channels and experience loss of sound or blurred images			0
hundreds of thousands of people could struggle to watch @entity3 television programmes next week because of tests to assess the impact of new @entity7 mobile phone networks with the switch - over of tv services to digital , a band of frequencies previously used by tv is being made available for phone firms to offer high speed 4g services			1
in certain circumstances , it is possible that new 4g services at 800 @entity31 could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital tv signals , meaning viewers will need to fit a filter or , in around 40,000 cases , use cable or satellite providers			0
people in parts of @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 are being alerted to the test			0
hospitals , care homes , schools and businesses have been issued with advice on how to avoid any problems , while further arrangements are being made to support vulnerable people during the trial			0
the test follows a smaller pilot in the @entity56 where people living in 22,000 homes were warned they could experience interference last month			0
on that occasion , only 15 households reported problems with television reception caused by @entity7 , as opposed to the predicted 120			1
the trials are being conducted by at800 , a firm tasked with ensuring viewers continue to receive free - to - air television when @entity7 broadband is switched on at 800 mhz this summer			2
@entity69 , chief executive of at800 , said : ‘ these larger tests are essential to help improve our forecast model and the way we 'll tackle potential issues caused by @entity7 at 800 @entity31 ‘ we are extremely grateful to viewers in south - east @entity10 for their help with these important tests			1
’ at least 170,000 households and businesses in southeast @entity10 are being warned their digital tv signal could be disrupted on monday because of the trial viewers in the area have been asked to report problems with television reception from monday			1
teams will be placed on stand - by to respond to calls and restore @entity3 services if they break down			0
viewing issues could arise because the high - speed mobile phone service at 800 @entity31 , and digital television , operate in adjacent parts of the radio spectrum			2
therefore , equipment that receives television signals - such as aerials , amplifiers , and digital tuners - can fail to block @entity7 at this frequency			2
satellite and cable tv services are unlikely to be affected by @entity7 at 800 @entity31 anyone in the south - east @entity10 area with @entity3 disruption on monday is asked to call at800 on 0333 31 31 800			1
those at risk of interference from @entity7 services will be contacted directly by post			2
