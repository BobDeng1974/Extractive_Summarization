two men in @entity8 , @entity9 , got the shock of their lives while driving down a three - lane road at about 70km/h ( about 43 mph )			1
despite their speed , all of a sudden an inquisitive red - bellied black snake - a venomous creature native to the country 's east coast , which can grow up to 2 meters long - pops up out of nowhere on their windscreen			1
the driver and passenger , not knowing what to do , slow down and start filming the experience			2
the incident occurred on @entity47 in @entity33 , a semi-urban area just east of the state 's capital city , @entity50			2
initially the pair use their windscreen wipers to try and flick the dangerous animal off			0
however this only entangles it further			0
it also seems to enrage the snake			0
@entity59 with anger : in this scary moment of the video , the red - bellied snake , seeming quite enraged , attempts to find a way into the car			1
luckily for the two men inside , all the windows were done up eeek ! the snake makes its move from the windscreen to the passenger window in the sunlight , the red scales the snake that define the snake become apparent ' i do n't know what to do - he 's got too much grip , ' the driver says at one point			1
in the second part of the video , which is much more intense , the now - angry snake can be seen nudging the window of the passenger window , appearing to try and get inside the car			1
the driver then decides to speed up the car hoping the snake will fall off in the process			0
finally , after about five minutes recording two videos , the snake finally falls from the car			0
i can see you : the snake looks straight into the camera while wrapping itself around the side mirror @entity100 : the snake continues to try and get inside the car , much to the horror of the men inside it hits the ground and slithers off the road , hiding underneath a shipment of bricks outside the @entity110			1
not that this would have helped the men at the time , but bites from a red - bellied black snake are rarely life - threatening			2
while their venemon is highly toxic , the snakes usually choose to inject very little when biting			0
humans who are bit , however , require immediate medical attention			0
finally ! : after about five minutes , the snake finally falls from the vehicle and slithers off into the distance			0

two men driving down a three - lane road in @entity33 , a town in @entity8 , @entity9 , were not *anticipating* a snake to climb aboard their utility
*frantically* the men try different methods to shake off the snake , but it just hangs on
at one scary point , the creature can be seen trying to get inside the car , nipping at the passenger window
the pair filmed the experience and the video has *quickly* become a @entity40 hit
