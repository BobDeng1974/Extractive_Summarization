they are among 25 schools under investigation by @entity8 over claims that @entity52 hard - liners are seizing control of governing bodies , segregating male and female pupils and banning sex education			1
@entity12 published today a list of 18 schools which are under investigation by @entity8 over the alleged ' @entity10 ' plot			1
the institutions are : @entity39 , @entity46 @entity62 , @entity46 @entity18 , @entity19 @entity63 , @entity17 @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity46 @entity64 , @entity17 @entity65 , @entity66 @entity67 , @entity17 @entity42 , @entity46 @entity68 , @entity69 @entity70 , @entity66 @entity14 , @entity15 @entity71 , @entity66 @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity46 @entity72 , @entity66 @entity73 , @entity74 @entity75 , @entity76 @entity77 , @entity78 one school is even being investigated over allegations that the @entity34 - linked @entity52 preacher @entity33 , who died in a @entity83 drone strike in @entity84 in 2011 , was praised in assembly			1
sir @entity36 , council leader , said @entity8 was not intending to publish its final inspection reports until ' the first or second week of may '			1
he added that he has not yet seen the draft version of the inspection reports , which have been carried out at the request of education secretary @entity90			0
in an investigation progress briefing today , sir @entity36 also criticised the apparent leaking of an @entity94 ( @entity94 ) report into three city academies to a national newspaper			2
he said the @entity98 is currently investigating how the document was obtained by the media			0
the ' @entity10 ' allegations first came to light earlier this year , contained in an anonymous and unsigned letter			2
they have prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) and @entity8			0
on saturday , @entity107 reported that six of the schools at the centre of the iinquiry faced being placed in special measures			0
sir @entity36 described the leaking of the @entity94 report as ' wholly reprehensible ' - adding that one school had been inaccurately included in press articles when it was unconnected with the current inquiries			0
although 25 schools are involved in three separate investigations into the plot , the city council 's chief executive , @entity118 , said he was in ' no position ' to identify the remaining seven schools because inquiries were still ' in the early stages '			1
the council ’s investigation is being headed by former headteacher @entity129 , who is sifting through about 200 concerns raised since the alleged ' @entity10 ' plot emerged			1
meanwhile , while the @entity106 has appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the @entity134 ’s counter-terrorism unit @entity135			0
inquiry : the institutions are among 25 schools under investigation by @entity8 over allegations that @entity141 are seizing control of governing bodies			1
above , one of the schools , @entity146 in @entity17 claims : the ' @entity10 ' allegations came to light earlier this year			1
above , @entity39 in @entity46 officials : the city council 's chief executive , @entity118 ( left ) , said today he was in ' no position ' to identify the remaining seven schools			2
right , @entity135 has been appointed as the @entity106 's education commissioner the @entity106 announced mr @entity135 ’s appointment on april 15 - prompting dismay from teachers ’ leaders , @entity52 community members and the chief constable of @entity162 @entity161			0
they described it as ' desperately unfortunate ' , and a decision which would be misinterpreted by some people , given his anti-terror background			0
but the @entity106 said his experience of high - level investigations meant he was the right man to carry out his role effectively , while acting in a ' professional and dispassionate manner ' request : the inspections are being carried out at the direct request of education secretary @entity90 mr @entity118 said it was the council understanding that sir @entity176 , the head of @entity8 , had been over-seeing its inquiry for some time			2
he added that sir @entity90 would likely publish an ' overview report ' at the same time as the individual school reports were released			0
both mr @entity135 and sir @entity90 have separately spoken with the council in recent weeks - and mr @entity118 said he was still working ' to persuade ' the latter to give the local authority ' early sight ' of the @entity8 reports			2
it comes as the council has announced the make - up of its @entity10 review group , which mr @entity129 will report to			2
it includes @entity189 , the headteacher of @entity190 - one of the schools which has been inspected by @entity8 - @entity192 , the @entity194 mp for @entity195 , and @entity196 , the @entity197 , as well as an unnamed senior muslim community member			0
sir @entity36 said he had asked for a single joint investigation by the council , @entity106 and @entity8 - but ' for whatever reason , the @entity202 ( @entity90 ) decided he wanted to go it alone and appoint @entity135 '			2
he said : @entity8 and the secretary of state will operate in whatever manner they so wish			0
' mr @entity118 added : ' we do n’t condone the secretary of state ’s appointment , but one small part of explanation is we do expect @entity135 to have a wider brief than just @entity22			0
so in one sense we can understand he might want separation			0
' but the value of collaborating is clear			0
nobody wants to have to go through the evidence three times or have multiple reports			0
