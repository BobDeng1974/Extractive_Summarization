by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:46 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 21:36 est , 31 october 2013 a @entity5 boy who shot dead his neo-nazi father at age 10 has been sentenced to seven years in juvenile prison			1
in sending the boy to a detention center instead of a mental hospital , @entity10 judge @entity9 ruled that @entity14 - now age 12 - is a threat to society and must be kept behind bars			1
defense lawyers had argued he needed intensive treatment , not a prison cell , in order to rehabilitate him			0
under the sentence , @entity14 is expected to be eligible for parole when he is 20 - though he could get paroled at age 18 with good behavior			1
he can not be held past age 23			2
he will likely be sent to the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity5 - a juvenile prison that houses inmates in bunk - style housing and includes school classes and strict discipline			2
troubled : @entity14 was just 10 when he admitted to shooting his father in the head at point blank range while he slept @entity14 will likely be sent to the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity5 ( stock photo ) in may 2011 , @entity14 shot his father @entity36 in the head at point blank range as the 32 - year - old slept on the couch			1
he was just 10 at the time - one of the youngest boys charged with murder in recent years			2
@entity14 was a leader of the local chapter of the neo-nazi group the @entity43			1
in january , a judge convicted him of second degree murder			0
since then prosecutors and defense attorney 's have been locked in battle over where @entity14 should serve out his sentence			1
for an adult , the charge usually carries a sentence of 40 years to life			0
@entity10 prosecutors say the boy has a history of violent behavior - choking his teacher , stabbing his sister and clubbing his uncle - and that he planned the killing because he did n't like his father			1
the defense questioned whether it is right to punish a 13 - year - old boy for a killing he committed two and a half years ago and how best to rehabilitate someone who grew up in an abusive home , attacked his elementary school teachers and was indoctrinated in the beliefs of white supremacy			2
he has been living in the county 's juvenile hall since the killing but spent about three months at a state youth detention center where he was evaluated to see whether a placement there could serve his needs			2
several people from the state are expected to testify at the hearing			0
in the meantime , the small child who scribbled on a notepad and looked bored during his trial as prosecutors displayed photos of his father 's blood - splattered body grew into a gangly teenager who is more focused than ever before			2
he attends class , gets regular therapy and has made progress in controlling the violent outbursts that got him kicked out of almost every school he attended			0
he has even , with time , won the affection of the prosecutor who got him convicted			0
neo-nazi : @entity36 , 32 , was a regional leader of the white supremacist group the @entity43 - though prosecutors argue that had nothing to do with his murder ' i have grown attached to him in an odd way			1
i enjoy watching him grow and change but i am convinced he has done better in a quasi-military penal environment , ' said @entity10 chief deputy district attorney @entity110			0
' he seems to like it , he knows what the rules are and what is expected and he is treated with dignity			0
' that 's why @entity110 argued the boy , now 13 , would do best in the state 's juvenile justice system , where he would go to school and live in a dorm - like setting at a high - security facility for young offenders , possibly until age 23			1
defense attorneys , however , said the teen has serious emotional disabilities that the state is n't equipped to handle			0
they want to see him placed in a residential treatment center , where security would be lighter and the therapy would be more intense			0
@entity133 , the boy 's defense attorney , said he would also be at risk in a state facility because of his father 's neo-nazi beliefs			1
' it is a very dangerous place for him			0
he 's got a lot of vulnerability here , ' she said			0
' when he comes out at 23 , we 've got a huge problem			0

' with the current situation , it looks really dim , ' @entity154 said			0
@entity157 said her son has been struggling with emotional issues and learning challenges as a result of his upbringing			0

' if the end goal is rehabilitation , then that youth 's mental health concerns are going to have to be front and center , ' she said			0
' i think the judge has to ask the question , when this kid walks out — and this kid will walk out eventually — how is this kid going to be better ? ' @entity14 's killing attracted national attention when it happened on may 1 , 2011 — and not just because of the defendant 's age			1
@entity14 , an out - of - work plumber , was also a regional leader of the @entity43 who organized neo-nazi rallies at synagogues and day labor sites and had hosted a meeting for the group at his house the day before he died			1
@entity14 , 32 , ran unsuccessfully for a water board in 2010 and alarmed voters with his white supremacist rhetoric			2
prosecutors say @entity14 waited until @entity36 passed out drunk on the couch after an argument with his wife and then retrieved his father 's @entity210 magnum revolver and shot him in the head at point - blank range			1
