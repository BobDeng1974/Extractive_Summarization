@entity1 manager @entity0 admitted he liked the way @entity3 played in defeat to his side at @entity6 on saturday			1
however , mistakenly calling @entity8 's side ' @entity7 ' in a post-match interview with @entity10 slightly tarnished the @entity12 's sentiments			0
the @entity3 ’ ‘ currant ’ run of form sees them without a win in their previous five @entity19 games			0
goals from @entity21 and @entity22 were enough to earn @entity24 ’s side all three points and condemn @entity3 to yet another defeat			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 accidentally called @entity3 ' @entity7 ' post-match @entity8 's side may have earned the plaudits from @entity0 but they lot yet again but the @entity12 manager was clearly impressed with what he saw from @entity8 ’s side and was quick to compliment the west @entity34 club following their display at @entity6			1
although those connected with the club in any way would probably have taken the praise slightly more seriously if he had managed to get their name right			0
instead , football fans took to @entity44 to poke fun at the former @entity47 manager for his unfortunate mistake in front of the rolling cameras as his gaffe went viral			2
@entity21 reels away in celebration as he gives @entity0 's side the lead against @entity3 @entity22 scores after coming on as a sub in the 2 - 0 win over @entity3 at @entity6 on saturday			1

@entity0 accidentally calls @entity3 ' @entity7 '
