by @entity0 published : 02:58 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 03:02 est , 20 july 2012 @entity1 has developed a ' perfect ' amplifier which uses hi - tech superconducting technologies to amplify the faint signals we hear from space			1
the device will be an ' ear to the universe ' which will allow us to study stars , galaxies and black holes - as well as exploring the ' quantum ' world inside the atom			0
‘ this amplifier will redefine what it is possible to measure , ’ said @entity16 , at @entity1 's @entity17			1
all the way up to 11 : @entity1 has developed a nearly perfect amplifiier , which will be used for everything from studying stars , galaxies and black holes to exploring the quantum world and developing quantum computers researchers at @entity1 's @entity17 and the @entity29 , both in @entity30 , have developed a new type of amplifier for boosting electrical signals			1
an amplifier is a device that increases the strength of a weak signal			1
‘ amplifiers play a basic role in a wide range of scientific measurements and in electronics in general , ’ said @entity38 , a principal scientist at @entity17 and a visiting associate in physics at @entity29			0
‘ for many tasks , current amplifiers are good enough			0
but for the most demanding applications , the shortcomings of the available technologies limit us			0
’ one of the key features of the new amplifier is that it incorporates superconductors — materials that allow an electric current to flow with zero resistance when lowered to certain temperatures			0
for their amplifier , the researchers are using titanium nitride and niobium titanium nitride , which have just the right properties to allow the pump signal to amplify the weak signal			2
although the amplifier has a host of potential applications , the reason the researchers built the device was to help them study the universe			1
the team built the instrument to boost microwave signals , but the new design can be used to build amplifiers that help astronomers observe in a wide range of wavelengths , from radio waves to x-rays			2
‘ it 's hard to predict what all of the applications are going to end up being , but a nearly perfect amplifier is a pretty handy thing to have in your bag of tricks , ’ @entity16 said			2
and by creating their new device , the researchers have shown that it is indeed possible to build an essentially perfect amplifier			1
‘ our instrument still has a few rough edges that need polishing before we would call it perfect , but we think our results so far show that we can get there			0
’ the team recently described the new instrument in the journal @entity102			0

device built of superconducting coil of wire
can amplify *incredibly* faint signals from space
amplifier is ' nearly perfect ' say @entity1 scientists
