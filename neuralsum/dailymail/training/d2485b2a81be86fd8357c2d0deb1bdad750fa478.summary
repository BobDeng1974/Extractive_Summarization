far from being detrimental to health , enjoying s&m may make people less neurotic and more outgoing some may think it is perverse , but enjoying the snap of the whip or the clink of chains on skin could make you more psychologically healthy than those who enjoy a more mundane sex life			1
a study found that bdsm - bondage , discipline , sadism and masochism - enthusiasts scored better on a variety of personality and psychological tests compared to those who did not have sexual fetishes			1
experts say this is because those who enjoyed kinky sex were more extroverted , more open to new experiences and less neurotic			2
dr @entity26 , a psychologist from @entity27 , found that @entity31 practitioners ‘ either did not differ from the general population and if they differed , they always differed in the more favourable direction ’			1
dr @entity26 and his fellow researchers asked bdsm fans to undergo a variety of psychological questionnaires online			2
they also sought participants who did not do @entity31 via a women 's magazine website , a personal secret website and a university website			0
participants did not know what the surveys were about , other that they concerned ‘ human behaviour ’			0
in total 902 bdsm practitioners and 434 non-bdsm participants filled out questionnaires on personality , sensitivity to rejection , style of attachment in relationships and happiness			0
the @entity57 study also found that those who dominated in sex games were the most psychologically balanced			1
those who were submissive were no less mentally balanced than the rest of the general population , however the results revealed that on a basic level , @entity31 practitioners are no more troubled than the general population			1
in fact they were more outgoing , more open to new experiences and more conscientious than less adventurous participants			0
they were also less neurotic , a personality trait marked by anxiety			0
enjoying the clink of chains in skin can be a sign that you are mentally balanced @entity31 aficionados also scored lower than the general public on rejection sensitivity , a measure of how paranoid people are about others disliking them			1
people in the bdsm scene reported higher levels of happiness in the past two weeks than people outside it , and they said they felt more secure in their relationships			0
interestingly , the role a person played when engaging in @entity31 behaviour seemed to be linked to a person ’s psychological profile			2
dominants tended to be the most balanced , submissives the least and switches ( those who enjoy dominating and being dominated ) were in the middle			2
but submissives never scored lower than the general population on mental health , and frequently scored higher			1
‘ within the bdsm community , [ submissives ] were always perceived as the most vulnerable , but still , there was not one finding in which the submissives scored less favourably than the controls , ’ @entity26 told @entity100			0
the findings were published in the @entity108 .			0

those who enjoy *indulging* in fetishes are psychologically healthier and happier than the general population , say @entity57 researchers
experts believe this is because they are more outgoing and less neurotic
those who played the dominating role in sex games were *deemed* as the most mentally healthy and submissives the least
but none of the @entity124 participants scored lower than the general population in psychological tests
