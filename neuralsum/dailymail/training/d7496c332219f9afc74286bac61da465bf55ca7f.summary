before the @entity1 began , @entity0 predicted confidently that @entity1 would become known as the ' girlie games '			0
what incredible foresight the @entity4 track cyclist showed			2
her prophecy has come true in spectacular fashion , with @entity9 's girls delivering many of the historic moments for which these @entity12 will be forever remembered			2
from @entity14 powering to gold in the heptathlon and @entity18 's incredible elegance in the dressage , to the hurricane force of boxer @entity21 and the immense strength of character shown by our rowers , @entity13 2012 has definitely been about our female athletes			1
scroll down for interviews with the winners @entity21 beat @entity30 's @entity29 to claim gold in the 51kg boxing category yesterday , at the time @entity4 's 24th gold of the @entity12 @entity18 won her second gold of @entity1 yesterday afternoon in the @entity35 there was late - night glory for @entity38 in the taekwondo yesterday , @entity4 's 25th gold @entity41 ( @entity42 ) @entity43 ( flyweight 51kg ) track @entity44 ( @entity46 ) @entity47 ( @entity48 ) @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 ) @entity52 ( @entity35 ) @entity18 , @entity53 and @entity54 ( @entity55 ) @entity56 and @entity57 ( women 's pair ) @entity59 and @entity60 ( double sculls ) @entity62 and @entity63 ( lightweight double sculls ) @entity65 ( under 57kg ) in fact , if @entity9 's women were to compete independently of the men , they would be seventh in the medal table			1
their ten gold medals would put them level with @entity75 's overall tally and ahead of @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
@entity9 's women have five times as many golds as @entity83 and @entity84 , and more than those two nations combined with @entity79			1
and this does n't take into consideration two of @entity4 's equestrian golds - the team dressage winners were two - thirds female and the team eventing gold medallists four - fifths			1
from orchestrating the beat - perfect movement of the horses in the dressage to executing brutal kicks to the head in taekwondo , @entity4 's women have delivered right across the spectrum of @entity101 sports			1
it was the brilliant row of @entity103 and @entity57 in the women 's pair that broke @entity4 's gold medal duck on the fifth day of the @entity12 , prompting an avalanche of precious metal and glorious moments			1
@entity14 won the heptathlon in superb style on saturday night @entity0 took gold in the @entity46 , just one of seven gold medallists won by @entity4 's track cyclists at these games and the woman tipped to succeed @entity0 , @entity47 , won gold in the omnium event @entity120 ( centre ) also collected a second gold with @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 in the team pursuit trott with @entity13 mayor @entity124 at the launch of the @entity127 event today their success at @entity130 was followed up by two more rowing golds , including an emotional moment of fulfillment for @entity59 , who won gold at last in the double sculls after three consecutive silver			1
female success then moved indoors , to the electric atmosphere of the @entity139			2
' @entity140 ' @entity0 may have jumped the gun in the team sprint but she showed her familiar strength of character to return 24 hours later and blitz the field in the keirin			0
and @entity0 's heir apparent @entity47 , just 20 , exploded onto the biggest stage with twin golds in the omnium , the most arduous of cycling events , and the team pursuit alongside @entity49 and @entity50			2
the golden dynasty of @entity4 track cycling appears to be set to continue for some time yet			2
boxer @entity21 ( in blue ) knocks down @entity30 's @entity29 in the final of the @entity156 category yesterday @entity21 and @entity157 both won gold medals yesterday @entity18 pats her horse @entity160 after a flawless six - minute dressage routine delivered her second gold medal of the @entity12 yesterday @entity18 had already won gold in the @entity55 event two days earlier , alongside @entity54 ( centre ) and @entity53 ( right ) perhaps the defining moment of @entity4 success at these @entity12 arrived a few moments before 9pm on saturday night , when @entity14 , the poster girl of the @entity4 team , completed her heptathlon triumph before an adoring crowd in the @entity172			1
the sight of @entity4 athletes parading around a venue , smiling broadly and with the @entity176 fluttering behind them , before wiping away the mandatory tear on the medal podium , has become a delightfully common one			1
the glory has continued this week in three contrasting sports			0
@entity18 and @entity53 won gold in the dressage , an event of grace and elegance , while @entity21 and @entity38 did likewise in boxing and taekwondo , sports of unbridled power and brute force			1
we have become so accustomed to hearing ' @entity192 ' during these games that it would be easy to forget the silver and bronze medals , but the female roll of honour goes on and on			2
@entity197 has never finished out of the medals in an @entity101 event , though she would n't perhaps of envisaged two bronze medals from her home games			2
@entity202 won our first medal , a silver , in the women 's road race - a few seconds of early drama as three cyclists sprinted down @entity209 which truly set the tone for countless moments of @entity101 theatre to come			1
the judoka @entity214 took silver and devoted it to her late mum in a heart - wrenching moment			0
@entity38 ( right ) delivers a kick to the head of opponent @entity221 of @entity30 on her way to gold in the under - 57kg taekwondo competition last night @entity103 ( left ) and @entity57 ended @entity4 's gold drought in the women 's pair final on @entity228 of the @entity12 and further female success in the rowing came when @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 won the double sculls their performances drew gushing praise from @entity235 , who also pointed out that the @entity1 are the first ever in which both men and women have been included in every squad and participated in every sport			1
he added that the @entity12 had continued the progress for women 's sport made in the last @entity244 in 1948			1
' i think that having 1948 with @entity246 here really moved that argument for the presence of women in the @entity12			0
' we 've had more women competing in these @entity12 ( and ) some of the big high - profile moments			0
' if you look at this morning 's media they are focusing on women			2
' he also praised the participation of @entity258 who became one of the first women to represent @entity262 at the @entity1 when she ran in the 800 metres			0
her appearance followed months of talks , with @entity262 @entity101 chiefs at one point insisting no women would be allowed to take part			0
lord @entity235 said she had ' really moved this agenda on in @entity13 ' @entity272 spokesman @entity271 said : ' if you take , for example , 1984 , only 24 % of athletes were women			1
' @entity277 , our provisional figure is that this is just over 44 %			0
so we are nearly at gender equality , which is really good going			0
' but he added : ' just getting all the @entity282 ( @entity283 ) to send athletes is great , symbolic and an important symbol , but that is not enough			0
' we continue to push the @entity282 and work with the @entity282 to provide sporting facilities for women , which is challenging in some countries			0
so we will continue to work on that too			0
' @entity59 and @entity60 were congratulated by prime minister @entity292 at the @entity293 this morning @entity62 and @entity294 picked up more precious metal in the lightweight double sculls final and all this , just eight months after a @entity298 shortlist that did n't contain a single woman			0
there have been so many brilliant successes that some pundits have wildly speculated there should be separate awards for men and women			0
this is ridiculous - at least half of this year 's shortlist will be female			2
but there is a prize far greater than this - a generation of girls inspired by this roster of @entity101 role models to get involved in all manner of sports			0
they want to run , jump and throw like @entity320 , pedal like @entity0 and even punch like @entity43			0
sports clubs the length and breadth of the country are already being overwhelmed with new recruits			0
the @entity1 has certainly captured the imagination - witness the record 80,203 crowd at @entity330 last night for the women 's football final - and the challenge now is to convert this feel - good factor into @entity4 's olympians of the future			1
@entity9 is punching way above its weight in the @entity1 , as shown by an interactive atlas which distorts the size of countries to reflect the number of medals won			1
a researcher at the @entity343 has created a map which displays the distribution of medals at @entity1			0
the online atlas continually updates to show how the medals are spread across the globe as well as the number of medals by population			1
when countries are reconfigured by population size , @entity4 swells considerably			1
this map , created by the @entity343 , shows the number of medals won in the @entity1 so far for each country the map shows how well nations are doing by their population size the @entity343 , predicted to win the most medals , appears smaller than usual and second - place favourites @entity30 shrinks to a fraction of its actual size because of its massive population			1
@entity364 is doing poorly considering its population size , while @entity366 and @entity367 are leading countries			2
the map is updated every hour and can be viewed at www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geoinformatics .			0

@entity4 's female olympians have won ten gold medals , the same number as @entity75
they *outrank* @entity76 , @entity83 and @entity78 in the medal table after wins in events from rowing to taekwondo
*scientific* study shows @entity4 punching way above its weight for size of population
lord @entity235 praises contribution of female athletes at @entity244
