we came back and made lots of chances			0
it was an excellent performance with a lot of pressure on the game today			0
’ the visitors led after only four minutes , through a classy finish from @entity47 , but succumbed to pressure and trailed at half - time thanks to @entity69 ’s calamitous own goal and @entity71 ’s opportunism			1

it was his fifth in six appearances here this season , all of great value			0
it may only be late november , but with @entity20 18th and @entity6 20th at the start of play , the term ‘ six - pointer ’ could just about be justified			1

but that agonising wait ended at 504			0
on their first assault , @entity76 fed the ball in from the left and @entity82 nudged it right to the incoming @entity47			1

@entity6 had enjoyed most of the ball but it took them an age to start creating meaningful chances			2
@entity60 waltzed his way into a shooting position but failed to release the ball , much to the crowd ’s consternation			0

straight from the re-start , @entity20 caught their opponents napping and @entity81 ’s powerful strike hit @entity51 on the chest			2

all their own work this time as @entity59 swung in an inviting cross from the right , @entity12 launched into a header that @entity72 beat out			2
but there was @entity71 , following up , to smash home the rebound , his first goal since joining from @entity218			1

@entity79 forced @entity51 into a block before his right - wing delivery was flicked onto the crossbar by @entity81			0
a third goal would have been handy for @entity6 and @entity36 looked the most likely to provide it			1

the game swung in the balance and @entity47 ’s quick free - kick caught the @entity6 defence asleep			1

@entity72 saved brilliantly from @entity71 ’s header but the resulting corner caused panic in the @entity20 defence			1
@entity53 ’s close - range effort after a mad scramble was blocked on the line by @entity83 but there was @entity12 with a stooping header to send @entity4 into raptures			2
