her newborn son had suffered severe blood and fluid loss and contracted suspected sepsis during the delivery			1
the 22 - year - old from @entity21 , @entity22 , claims midwives at @entity24 , where @entity1 was delivered , should have realised he was in a life - threatening condition and ordered an emergency caesarean earlier			1
after being transferred to @entity27 and @entity28 after the birth , she said nurses told her that a member of staff from @entity33 had called to see if her baby ' was dead yet '			1
the allegation was refuted by a hospital spokesperson , who said there was ' no evidence ' the ' wholly unacceptable ' comment was made by its staff			1
she said : ' what happened to us was absolutely appalling			0
we are both so lucky to be here			0
' ms @entity0 was rushed to the hospital in @entity33 on may 13 by her partner , @entity45 , 23 , as her contractions fell to just two minutes apart and she received gas and air , pethidine and an epidural			2
when her waters broke at 3.30am , they were thick with meconium , a sign that @entity1 could be in distress			0
despite a monitor showing her son ’s heart rate was dipping , she claims a doctor who attended to her said the baby was fine			1
she had to have her epidural topped up twice , but by 7.30am her contractions had stopped completely			0
' i thought he had just given up - it was heart - breaking			0
' @entity1 - @entity66 in hospital after the complicated birth process			1
