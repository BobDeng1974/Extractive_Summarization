by @entity0 a labourer has dubbed himself the @entity2 after he broke his back bouncing off a trampoline - but carried on playing football and breakdancing for eight days			1
@entity7 , 26 , was drunk at his cousin 's barbecue when he jumped 20ft from an oak branch onto the outdoor toy , which catapulted him sideways into a fence			1
but mr @entity7 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , continued his everyday life with a sore back for more than a week before doctors discovered a compression fracture in his spine			1
mr @entity7 said : ' i was eyeing up the jump at the barbecue and the more i drank the more i wanted to do it			1
' @entity45 ' : mr @entity7 said he was unlikely to try the same trick again ' lots of the kids were doing front flips and i wanted to better them , so i decided to climb up the tree to jump off			1
' i was tipsy but it was quite painful			0
i was on the ground for two or three minutes - i nearly cried which i have n’t done for years			0
' when i hit the floor everyone went quiet and stopped laughing			0
' they wanted to make sure i was all right , but i managed to get up and continue drinking and enjoying the barbecue			2
' i did n’t think it was broken as i was able to get up and move around			0
' i even did some breakdancing later on			2
' the stunt was filmed by his girlfriend @entity62 , 25 , last sunday and captured guests cheering and screaming as mr @entity7 made the jump			1
the labourer , who expects to be unable to work or play sport for 10 weeks , said : ' i did n’t think nothing of it at first as i thought if i had broken anything i would n’t be able to walk			2
' but after eight days i decided to go to the hospital as i was still in pain			2
' they did n’t pick anything up on the x-ray at first but i got a call the next morning saying that i had a compression fracture of my back			1
' he added : ' it was a stupid thing to do - but you live and learn			0
you ’d have to pay me a lot of money to do it again			0
' pain : despite saying he almost wanted to cry from the pain , mr @entity7 did not visit the hospital for eight days back where it all began : the labourer with the trampoline which starred with him in the video			1
he said : ' it was a stupid thing to do - but you live and learn			0
