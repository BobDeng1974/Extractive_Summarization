@entity86 's first taste of @entity18 action will come away to lower league opposition , live on @entity2 @entity9 's tie with @entity10 is sure to evoke memories of the famous 1988 @entity18 final @entity0 's reward for a win over @entity94 is to be shown live against @entity1 on @entity2 @entity96 's goal in the second round has earned his side £ 144,000 in tv money @entity100 were one of the stories of the second round , but their tie against @entity104 will not be shown @entity0 are the only non-league club who will feature on live tv over the long weekend of football , with @entity100 ' home tie against @entity110 side @entity104 overlooked , despite a five - division gap between the two sides			1

for the second time in a row , seven of the 10 clubs shown will be from the @entity60 , including two all top - flight ties			0
