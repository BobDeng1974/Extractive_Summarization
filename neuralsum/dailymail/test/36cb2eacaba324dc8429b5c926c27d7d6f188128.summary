the @entity1 ’s staff will take industrial action for the first time in history over their ‘ ridiculously low ’ wages			1
wardens at @entity7 say they are expected to carry out extra duties , including giving guided tours to visitors , for no extra money			1
union chiefs claim workers earn as little as £ 14,700 despite working the ‘ country ’s richest family ’			0
wardens at @entity7 ( pictured here collecting flowers laid by well - wishers following the death of @entity19 ) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors , conducting security searches , telling people about the history of the @entity7 , and handing out free audio guides			1
but @entity29 ( @entity30 ) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free , such as leading paid - for tours , carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors			1
now , staff have voted ‘ overwhelmingly ’ in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered ‘ years of pay restraint ’			1
the @entity30 said 76 wardens out of 180 at the @entity7 will now refuse to host tours of the @entity43 and will instead ‘ work to rule – meaning they rigidly stick to their contractual obligations			2
the @entity30 said the @entity1 and @entity48 ( pictured at the @entity7 ) should not ' abuse the ( workers ' ) goodwill by not properly rewarding them ' wardens are also considering causing ‘ disruption ’ and ‘ long queues ’ by conducting more thorough security searches than usual and ‘ observing every single check they are supposed to do ’ – slowing down visitors ’ entry to the @entity7			0
the wardens work for the @entity60 , a charity which presides over one of the world ’s largest and most important works of art , jewels and artefacts			1
it is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation , so they are technically employees of the @entity72			0
a spokesman for the @entity30 said : ‘ the dispute here is not with the @entity1 and the @entity48 but the managers who run the @entity77 on their behalf			0
‘ the wardens who work at @entity7 are very loyal and want to work for the @entity48			2
‘ we believe our requests are modest and reasonable and , by not resolving this dispute , the @entity60 is dragging the @entity1 ’s name into this			2
that is not what staff want			0
’ staff claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties such as guiding visitors around @entity7 for no additional money the union has proposed that wardens receive an extra £ 150 a year for speaking a foreign language to visitors and an allowance for every day they conduct tours			1
they claimed that at nearby @entity102 , owned by a separate charity , wardens received an extra £ 10 to £ 15 a day for leading guided tours and that @entity7 staff should also receive ‘ fair recompense ’			0
the union said they narrowly accepted a poor pay offer last year on the understanding that additional allowances for tours and other skills would be considered this year			0
but following failed negotiations , non-strike industrial action could now start from the end of april			1
a @entity60 spokesman said : ‘ following the union ballot , we have been informed that some @entity30 - affiliated wardens at @entity7 will no longer participate in various activities undertaken during their working day , including using their language and first - aid skills , and conducting tours of specific areas of the castle during august and september			2
a spokesman for the @entity60 , which employee the wardens at one of the official residences of the @entity1 said they were ' disappointed ' with the result of the ballot ‘ these activities have never been compulsory			2
it has always been the choice of the individual as to whether they take part			0
‘ while the outcome of the ballot is disappointing , it will have no effect on services to visitors to the castle			0
’ the @entity60 said that only nine wardens were required to conduct tours every day out of an average of 85 wardens in work , and that the industrial action should have ‘ no impact ’ on visitors			1
asked about the threat of slower security searches , a spokeswoman said : ‘ security searches at @entity7 are rigorous and we would expect staff to carry out their usual duties			0
’ staff ’s wages were raised to the new ‘ living wage ’ , which is above the national minimum wage , earlier this month			2
this increased wardens ’ pay from £ 7.70 an hour ( £ 14,400 a year ) to £ 7.85 an hour ( £ 14,700 )			0
but the @entity30 complained that the living wage officially rose last november and that this wage hike should therefore be back - dated – a condition the @entity60 has now agreed to .			1
