team spirit at @entity1 was once so bad that @entity2 wished that he could skip training and fast forward to match day			1
@entity2 , who joined the club in january 2012 and was plunged straight into a relegation dog fight , says that the rifts in the squad then were so deep that he would have gladly missed the weekdays because of the animosity in the team			1
‘ for myself , it was more a case of just wishing at times that you did n’t have to go training for a week and could just turn up for a saturday , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ because when game time comes everyone is fighting for the same cause			2
two seasons ago , during the week sometimes tempers could flare			2
’ team spirit at @entity1 was once so bad that @entity2 wished that he could skip training sessions recalling the negativity of 2012 and 2013 , when @entity1 were a team characterised by their lack of fight , serves a purpose			1
for , though bottom of the table now with four points , with @entity30 coming to @entity31 today and with manager @entity32 under pressure , @entity2 has some perspective			1
bad though it may seem , things were infinitely worse then			0
ironically , in 2011 - 12 , despite the rancour @entity1 stayed up			1
however , the following season , with an equally bad atmosphere in the dressing room , they were relegated , with @entity32 overseeing only the latter half of the season before guiding the club back to the @entity44 last may			1
‘ two and half seasons ago we stayed up with all that , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ and this season we ’re in a better position all round : the club , the players , the squad			0
and there are 31 games to go there is plenty of time to get out of this			2
‘ the club has come on in terms of the squad , the management , the facilities , the training pitches			2
all aspects of the club are a lot better than two and half years ago			1
there are only four or five lads left from that time and there has been a big turnaround			1
there is a good togetherness			0
the lads all get on now			0
@entity72 has come and he has been impressed at how the lads are together			0
he was at @entity74 a long time and he ca n’t believe the togetherness of the lads and the spirit			2
’ that said , @entity72 and the new signings such as @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 will have to start delivering victories soon			0
@entity1 spent significantly again in the summer despite the financial issues at the club			1
the latest financial results show a loss of £ 65.7million for the last season in the @entity44 , on a turnover of £ 60m — figures that are unlikely to improve after a season spent in the @entity94			1
striker @entity2 has played six of @entity1 's opening games back in the @entity44 this season the fine for breaching the @entity99 ’s @entity97 rules could be as much as £ 40m when the new figures are revealed — and the @entity99 are threatening to relegate the club to @entity103 if they are relegated and fail to pay it			1
with the planned new 40,000 - stadium in @entity107 being opposed by the current landowner , these are unsettling times at @entity31			2
having @entity109 seated alongside owner @entity110 today as the newly - installed @entity111 does not help calm matters			2
though @entity72 was appointed by @entity32 as a coach at @entity114 , he is these days more associated with his last boss , @entity115 , who along with @entity116 , would be a candidate to replace @entity32			0
@entity32 has been unfortunate in that key signing @entity118 is injured as is captain @entity119 while @entity84 is struggling for fitness			0
but losing @entity121 on the eve of transfer deadline day to a well - advertised buy - out clause was less of a shock			2
failing to support @entity2 and @entity126 up front has been the obvious huge omission from the summer spending			1
manager @entity32 - pictured with @entity109 - has a fight to keep the club in the top flight the only possible solution for all concerned is simply to stay up this season to avoid the multitude of looming issues			2
and @entity2 insists it is far too early to be concerned and that the players are behind @entity32			1
‘ @entity32 has a wealth of experience			0
he ’s seen it all : relegations , promotions , finals , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it really is crazy there is speculation with so many games to go			0
you can win two games and you ’re right back up there			0
’ ‘ we do n’t talk about the speculation at the minute because it ’s so early			0
you literally just need a couple of wins			0
although they are tough games they can be won			0
he brought most of us in			0
@entity32 has supported us and wanted us here			0
everyone is behind him and now we have just got to do our part on match day			0
’ @entity1 face @entity30 , @entity161 and @entity162 in the next three weeks – though you would imagine that the results against @entity165 ( home ) , @entity167 ( away ) and @entity168 ( home ) are more likely to define @entity32 ’s future			1
@entity2 puts on a good positive front			1
‘ catch me in four or five months to have this conversation , ’ he says			0
‘ we ’ll have plenty of points on the board then , i ’ m sure			0

@entity2 wanted to skip training sessions two years ago
team morale was at an all - time low at big - spending @entity1
but that has all changed this time around in the @entity44
