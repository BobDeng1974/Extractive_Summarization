o - no : ring - shaped bagels at the @entity22 cafe in @entity23 , south @entity19 was told to take down the @entity25 - themed display by @entity26 pride : the bagels were put up ahead of the @entity25 torch relay despite no one from the @entity4 , the government or any official sponsors complaining about the display of bread , the cafe had the book thrown at it by @entity26 in @entity19			1
two ‘ community wardens ’ swooped on the @entity37 , in @entity23 , within 20 minutes of manager @entity38 putting up the display			0
they claimed that putting the circular buns on show breached copyright rules			2

‘ it was just some bread hanging in a window , for goodness sake ! when a few customers such as myself started telling them off for being silly , they began taking pictures of us on their camera , which i found sinister			0
‘ if @entity64 can get away with blatantly cashing in on the @entity4 , it ’s ridiculous to punish a small cafe like this			1
