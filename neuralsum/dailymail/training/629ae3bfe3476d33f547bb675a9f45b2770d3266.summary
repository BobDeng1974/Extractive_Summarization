the company was a joint project with @entity6 , the corporation ’s commercial wing , which has now taken full control of the 50 per cent share that was split between @entity1 and @entity2 producer @entity17			1

' @entity1 and @entity17 went to the same prestigious private school in @entity70 , @entity71 , where they were two years apart , before working together on various tv projects including @entity2			2
the name @entity10 is believed it is a pun on ' better sex ' - a reference to an in - joke about one of the dormitories at @entity17 and @entity1 's former school			1
the often controversial star caused particular outrage when it emerged that he earned £ 3m in the year to march because of his stake in @entity85 made pre-tax profits of £ 15.2m and is estimated to be worth more than £ 50m			2
he is also a weekly columnist for the @entity87 and has become a prolific book writer , mainly of best - selling collections of his columns			2

i just do n't pay any attention to money , it 's rather vulgar			0
' @entity2 's success has a lot to do with @entity1 's unique writing and presenting style , but the outspoken 52 - year - old has run into plenty of controversy along the way			1

a year later he illustrated dangerous driving conditions with a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red g - string , which was branded ' distasteful '			2
spin doctor @entity141 revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment @entity1 was asked by him about gay rights and he replied , ' i demand the right not to be bummed			0
' in other gaffes he compared a @entity148 to a person with special needs , called @entity151 ' lazy ' , ' feckless ' and ' flatulent ' , said long queues at airport control could be solved by ' a bit of racism ' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints			0
