by @entity1 reporter published : 17:31 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 02:22 est , 19 june 2013 @entity2 is regularly labelled ‘ cocky ’ and ‘ arrogant ’ by his critics and judging from his latest line of @entity6 trainers they ’ve got a fair point			1
photographs released of the new low - top version of the @entity11 trainer show the shoe features the wording ‘ 2 - @entity14 ’ - a rather bold claim considering @entity2 has won just one @entity17 title and his chances of a second win are hanging in the balance			2
the bold prediction is printed inside one shoe , while the other features the dates ' 11 - 12 ' and ' 12 - 13 ' , a reference to the fact @entity11 and the @entity28 won the championship last year and supposedly a prediction about this year 's eventual winners			0
as things stand the @entity28 and @entity32 are drawn 3 - 3 in the series with one game left to play on thursday at the @entity28 ’s home court			0
if @entity11 's - and @entity6 's - blushes are to be spared the @entity28 need to win the final game to win the @entity39			0
cocky prediction : the latest rang eof @entity11 trainers feature the wording '' 2 - @entity14 ' inside one shoe - something which @entity2 currently is n't the other shoe features the dates ' 11 - 12 ' and ' 12 - 13 ' , a reference to the fact @entity11 and the @entity28 won the championship last year and supposedly a prediction about this year 's eventual winners the new low - top version of the @entity11 trainer is the latest collaboration between @entity2 and @entity6 on the brink : the @entity28 must win games six and seven both in @entity28 to lift the @entity17 title again			1

the *basketball* star 's latest pair of @entity6 trainers *proclaim* him a ' 2 - @entity14 ' - something that has n't happened yet
the @entity28 star could be left looking rather *embarrassed* if the @entity32 win the championship
