by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 22 april 2013 the ongoing row over @entity3 ’s undercover documentary on @entity4 has been blown out of all proportion			1
i was one of the students who travelled to @entity8 with the @entity10 reporter and i was fully aware of the risks			1
did the @entity10 exploit us as students ? i do n’t think so			1
the ramifications of what mr @entity3 was doing and what might happen to us were outlined to me – and i believe to us as a group – as soon as we signed up to the trip			1
i was aware that a journalist was coming , and i was aware our organiser worked for the @entity10			1
we knew the dangers – potential detention , arrest , or deportation and blacklisting			1
and i believe that @entity29 , as a 21 - year - old student in international relations , am in a position to give my informed consent , even though the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) says otherwise			1
backing : @entity32 student @entity0 says the @entity10 was right to infiltrate the trip to @entity4 and insists students knew undercover reporter @entity3 was with them in truth , the trip was organised neither by the @entity32 , nor by the student society that advertised it			1
the @entity32 was merely a medium through which a group was formed			1
it was not involved in any other way			2
the college must have had its reasons for intervening , but in allowing the issue to become a nationwide media sensation , it has attracted unwanted attention to the matter			2
the trip to @entity4 was an invaluable experience for me			1
when we read about the country in our university library , there was a temptation to remain sceptical , perhaps to think that critical analysis is coloured by @entity57 ideas that equate simple lifestyles with suffering			2
but there is a huge difference between reading and first - hand experience			2
when you land in @entity8 , you take those doubts with you			2
you notice the barren landscape and think many countries have similar geography and remember that it ’s still the end of winter			2
then you meet your minders , and they seem perfectly normal people			2
they even let me keep my phone			2
and then things go steadily downhill			0
everywhere you see the faces of the @entity76 , the world ’s only communist dynasty			0
you note the fact that the country is ruled by its dead president , asleep in a spotless mausoleum , celebrated with millions of pounds ’ worth of gifts , while the rest of the country starves and shivers			0
you see empty universities , hospitals , barren farms and factories long out of use ; barbed wire surrounding what was meant to be a spa resort			0
a people stunted by malnutrition and living in fear , and yet still managing to seem jovial and good - humoured , waving and smiling to us from the streets			0
it is harrowing to realise that you could easily have been in their place – they , too , have families , hopes and dreams , their jobs and everyday lives , and yet they do not have so many things that we take for granted			1
it is true that we were not attacked , shot at or threatened ; and yet , even my grandmother ’s accounts of the @entity119 regime she grew up with in @entity120 did not lessen the impact of being within that prison state			0
as tourists , we stayed in luxury hotels – by @entity4 standards			0
we were driven around in a bus and yet you feel the isolation			0
then , as the days roll by , you begin to feel patronised			0
when we finally escaped the country and our @entity133 plane landed in @entity134 , we felt liberated , even though @entity135 is hardly a beacon of human rights			0
in queuing up to attack the @entity10 , mr @entity3 ’s critics have served only to portray journalistic endeavour in an entirely negative light			1
they have forgotten about the big picture : that the @entity10 film aimed to expose the reality of life under the @entity4 regime			1
the film raised a very important point , that the country is seen as a communist state and yet , despite its initial alliance with the @entity151 and @entity152 ’s @entity135 , it has evolved to be a far - right state much closer to @entity155 ’s @entity154 , complete with genocide against its own people , who are slowly starving to death			0
called the ‘ hermit kingdom ’ , it lives up to its name			0
there is no mobile network			0
no news from outside its heavily guarded borders			0
when one enters , one enters a social tundra			0
the doctrine of self - reliance and making one ’s own destiny , @entity174 – the @entity4 ’ brand of communism – has been twisted and distorted by the totalitarian government , turning the country ’s borders into prison bars and the ideology into a sordid farce that upholds its regime			0
the critics , too , belittle the benefits to the students of witnessing the work of an undercover journalist , the difficulties they face and the difficult choices they have to make			1
i believe it was a priceless contribution to my education			0
the @entity4 authorities would certainly not have welcomed a journalist aiming to disclose the dark secrets of their rogue state			1
i hope that as the temperature cools , more focus will be placed on the film and less on the ill - informed sideshow about the so - called ‘ exploitation ’ of me and my fellow students .			1
