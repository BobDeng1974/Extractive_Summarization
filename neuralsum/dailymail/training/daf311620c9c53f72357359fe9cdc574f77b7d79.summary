ms @entity3 said she called @entity7 to inform them of the error but claims a customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do			1
' they 've really caused grave stress for my family , ' she told @entity20			0

' i never use that credit card to withdraw cash ever , ' she said			0
' if i had never gotten money out i never would have known			0
' ms @entity3 said when she spoke to a customer service agent on sunday he first insisted the money was hers , and then told her she would have to ring back during business hours on monday if she had any concerns			1
' i said " it 's not my money " and he said " but it 's a compound of all your company 's funds " , but i do n't have a company , i 'm a sole trader , ' she said			2
' this gentleman did n't seem too concerned , he was more concerned with telling me that they were my funds			0
ms @entity3 used a @entity52 to withdraw $ 100 from her @entity7 bank account on saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $ 9,990,420.94 ' i 'm just appalled that @entity7 bank have n't contacted me , and i 'm really concerned that people really need to check the credit limits on their account			1
' on monday morning ms @entity3 still had not heard from the bank , and had checked her account again to find the $ 10 million was gone and she was listed as being $ 7500 in debt			1
' it 's just ridiculous , i mean they 've put $ 10 million credit on my credit card , ' she said			2
' now the fact is they 've put me in debt $ 7500			0
it 's someone 's debt but it 's not mine			0

' ms @entity3 said she called @entity7 to inform them of the error but claims the customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do an @entity7 spokeswoman said ms @entity3 had chosen to have an ' unlimited monthly spend cap ' on her account			1
' the available balance on the @entity5 receipt refers to the amount of the monthly spend cap rather than the available credit , ' she said			0
' we 're investigating why the @entity5 ’s receipt is showing the monthly spend cap rather than the actual balance			0
' we would like to apologise to ms @entity3 for any inconvenience and we will be contacting her today			2
