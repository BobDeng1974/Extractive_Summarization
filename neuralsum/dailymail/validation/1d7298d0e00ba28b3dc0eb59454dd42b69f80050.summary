@entity0 attracts many tourists each year who come to enjoy its landscape and wildlife			1
but one couple got more than they bargained for when they came head to head with an @entity11 bison - also referred to as a buffalo - while on the road			1
in the clip the car can be seen waiting in anticipation – indicator sounding – as a herd of three bison come galloping slowly towards it			1
getting closer and closer , the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car ’s front bumper			0
reacting , the filmmaker exclaims : ‘ do n’t run into our car , ’ just as the bison crashes into it – the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap. shocked , a lady in the car laughs as the man readjusts the camera and begins filming the two remaining bison , who look quite content standing sideways in the @entity38			1
as the bison gets closer it shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car ’s front bumper speaking about the incident , the filmmaker said : ‘ i thought the bison would simply run by our car at a full clip			2
' instead , at the last minute , the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head - butts our car			0
there was nothing we could do to avoid being hit			0
’ he added : ' it was fortunate that the car was turned off , since a head - on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph would likely cause the airbags to deploy			0
' as the filmmaker calls for the bison not to run into the car it continues charging forward and makes contact with it readjusting the camera , which was thrown up and then down by the impact , the video maker captures the bison waking away @entity0 is the only place in @entity11 where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times and as a result the area is home to the nation ’s largest bison population on public land			1
known for being agile despite their size , as well as aggressive , @entity78 can charge at up to 35mph			0
the bison population in @entity0 is estimated at 4,600 in two breeding herds			2
the other bison stay standing in the @entity38 as cars on the other side begin driving once more			0
