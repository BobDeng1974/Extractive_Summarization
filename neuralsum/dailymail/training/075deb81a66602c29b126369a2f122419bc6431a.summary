by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 16 october 2012 experts today claimed a group of wallabies have been living wild in the @entity6 countryside for 60 years after one was spotted darting in front of a taxi			1
driver @entity10 , 32 , was taking a group of girls home in the middle of the night when he spotted the animal hopping across the road			1
he said : ' this is the weirdest thing i have seen			0
i said to the girls i was sure we did not live in @entity20			0
we spent 40 to 50 minutes searching for the animal			0
unexpected : the wallaby was snapped by astonished @entity23 , 20 , one of the passengers in the taxi unlikely habitat : the village of @entity28 , @entity29 , where the wild wallaby was spotted ' as i had my hazards on , several taxis stopped			1
when i said we were looking for a kangaroo they just asked me if i was alright			0
' the girls in the back seat called the police - they sent two cars and when they saw the picture we had taken they started searching			2
' @entity23 was stunned when the wallaby hopped across the road in the @entity29 countryside as she went home after a night out @entity23 , 20 , one of the passengers in the taxi , said she thought it was hilarious and managed to snap a picture of the marsupial , usually found in the @entity20 outback			1
she said : ' i quickly got my phone out and took a picture of it because i thought no - one was going to believe me			0
' police officers eventually caught the animal in the early hours of sunday morning but were told by experts to let it go - as it had probably spent all its life in the wild			1
astonishingly , the marsupial is believed to be descended from a group of wallabies which escaped from @entity66 , @entity67 , in the 1950s			1
experts believe the resourceful group have managed to survive off shrubs and vegetation and even breed despite the harsh @entity6 winters			2
animal officers yesterday said they planned to leave the wallaby and any of its relatives free to roam in the wild where they have made their home			2
members of the public have been warned to leave the animals to their own devices if spotted out in the countryside			0
a spokeswoman for @entity85 said it probably descended from wallabies which escaped from @entity66 60 years ago			2
she said : ' it could be a private collector that lost one or it could be one of these ones that has decided to make its way across country			2
' they will live on foliage and berries so there is plenty of food for them out there so they have nothing to worry about			0
' it â€™s not the sort of thing a fox would go for - they have got quite a kick on them			0
' a spokesman for @entity29 police said they had located the creature and contacted wallaby owners in the area but no - one reported theirs missing			1
but the @entity118 and @entity85 advised them to leave the animal where it was because it is likely to be wild			0
freedom : the marsupial may be descended from a group of wallabies which escaped from @entity66 , @entity67 , in the 1950s			1
