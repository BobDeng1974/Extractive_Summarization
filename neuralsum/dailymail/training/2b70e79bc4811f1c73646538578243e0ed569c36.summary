@entity1 â€™s recently fired chief operating officer has received a final severance package of $ 58million after only working at the internet company for 15 months			1
a new regulatory filing released wednesday revealed the eight - figure payout that @entity6 was given by his former boss , @entity7 , after she both hired and fired him in just over a year			1
@entity8 dumped @entity6 , who was in charge of ad sales , in january after concluding he was n't executing on her plan for reviving @entity1 's lackluster ad growth			1
' and it 's a conclusion that we tried very hard to avoid , but it was the right decision in the end for the company			0
' after making the expensive mistake , @entity8 has said she wo n't pick another chief operating officer			1
@entity29 's severance pay more than doubled the amount that @entity1 paid @entity8 last year			1
@entity8 's compensation was valued at $ 24.9million , a 32 per cent decline from the previous year			0
the decrease stemmed primarily from a stock award of $ 35million that she received in july 2012 when @entity1 persuaded her to leave her previous job as a top @entity39 executive to become its ceo			2
@entity1 's stock has nearly tripled in value since @entity8 's arrival , even though the company 's revenue has n't increased under her leadership			2
musical chairs : @entity1 ceo @entity7 was the one to both hire @entity6 ( right ) to run the company 's ad sales department and then fire him 15 months later @entity1 previously disclosed @entity6 would be getting a severance package , but did n't reveal the amount until wednesday			1
the company 's board said most of the severance stemmed from the costs of luring @entity6 from his previous job at @entity39			2
like many other senior @entity39 executives , @entity6 would have received millions in stock by staying at the company			2
old ties : @entity29 was the vice president of global media and platforms at @entity39 before being brought over to @entity1 by his former colleague , @entity8 that prompted @entity1 to make up for some of the @entity39 awards he had to relinquish when he defected			1
' the board believed at the time mr. @entity6 was hired that he had a unique set of highly valuable skills and experiences that would be key to returning the company to long - term growth and success , ' @entity1 's compensation committee said in its defense of @entity6 's severance pay			1
the compensation committee ended up having such a dim view of @entity6 's performance in 2013 that it decided not to give him a bonus , according to wednesday 's filing			0
he was eligible for a bonus of up to $ 540,000 , or 90 per cent of the $ 600,000 salary that he received last year			0
@entity29 's severance package would n't have been worth nearly as much if @entity1 's stock had n't more than doubled during de @entity6 's brief tenure with the company			1
but those gains had little to do with the managerial acumen of @entity6 , @entity8 or any other @entity1 executives			2
analysts trace almost all the increase in @entity1 's stock price to the company 's 24 per cent stake in @entity101 's @entity100 , which is running some of the world 's fastest - growing and most - profitable e-commerce sites			0
@entity100 is planning to go public on the @entity104 and when that happens , @entity1 will be able to reap a multibillion dollar windfall from its holdings in the company			0
@entity1 headquarters in @entity109 , @entity110			0
the company suddenly finds the seat of @entity113 at the company empty after the swift departure of mr @entity6 @entity1 's own business remains in a funk			0
the @entity109 , @entity110 , company 's revenue , minus ad commissions , dipped 1 per cent last year			0
advertising sales showed some signs of modest improvement during the first three months of this year , but @entity1 is still lagging the overall growth of internet marketing			0
had @entity1 's stock price remained at roughly the same level as when @entity6 joined the company , his severance package value would have been worth about $ 17million .			1

chief operating officer @entity6 was one of @entity7 's key hires but she fired him 15 months later
@entity29 's severance package was formally revealed wednesday after regulatory filings proved he has received $ 58million
@entity8 and @entity6 worked together at @entity39 before she was lured away to @entity1
