by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 11:51 est , 27 august 2012 disturbing footage has been uncovered of two teenagers surfing on the back of a moving bus through a busy city centre			0
at one point a rider is shown tumbling off the vehicle in @entity9 , @entity10 , and could have easily fallen under the wheels or in front of another car			1
furious safety campaigners fear a spurt of copycat attempts and want the ' dangerous and foolish ' video banned			1
although the fallen boy managed to narrowly escape injury , safety charity @entity40 has branded the actions of the young people involved disgraceful			1
worryingly the video has already been ' liked ' by more than 700 @entity38 users and shared by almost 100 people so far			1
@entity49 , road safety officer with @entity40 , said the boys â€™ behaviour could have resulted in a serious accident			2
brainless : the two boys are shown here as they jumped on the bus in @entity9 ' we would encourage teenagers not to give into peer pressure by copying this behaviour , ' she said			1
@entity62 , community safety convener on @entity9 and @entity64 , described the footage as a display of ' utter stupidity '			2
' not only are these youths putting their own lives at risk , they are also putting other road users in danger , ' he said			0
' the people involved might have seen this as a bit of fun , but it could very easily have had tragic consequences			2
' holding on : after his pal fell off the other teen stayed on down the hill end : as the bus approaches a junction the boy jumps off , incredibly not having been injured a spokesman for @entity88 , who run the bus service , said the footage was ' very worrying '			0
' this is a very dangerous activity where those involved are putting themselves , as well as other road users , at risk , ' he added			0
' we are thankful that no serious injuries were caused as a result and would strongly discourage this behaviour			0
' @entity101 has not yet received any complaints about the video .			0

the two boys clung onto the vehicle in @entity9 , @entity10 , and their video has been *spread* online via @entity38
safety campaigners fear there will be copycat attempts and have branded the boys involved ' utterly stupid '
