@entity0 may be running out for @entity1			1
but ask him whether he 'd rather meekly give in to the illness that 's killing him or risk taking an unlicensed drug that might stave off its devastating effects , and his answer is unequivocal : he 'd take the drug - without a second 's hesitation			1
the 37 - year - old fire officer and father - of - one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease ( @entity13 ) in july 2011 at the age of just 34			1
he was told he had just two to five years to live			1
there is no cure for the disease , which affects the motor neurons - nerve cells that control muscles - in the brain and spinal cord			1
the muscles gradually waste away , affecting the patient 's ability to walk , talk , eat , drink , swallow and eventually breathe			2
@entity1 , who was diagnosed with @entity13 in june 2011 , with wife @entity27 and daughter @entity28 , 4 within a year of his diagnosis , @entity1 started losing the strength in his right arm and hand			1
his speech became slurred , and in 2012 he and @entity27 married while he could still say his vows			0
' now i have to feed @entity1 because the muscles in his tongue and throat have weakened , ' says @entity27			1
' his speech is very slurred so i often have to interpret what he says to other people			0
he ca n't use his arms and is starting to find walking more difficult			0
' the only treatment for @entity13 on the @entity43 is riluzole , which offers just three extra months of life after it 's been taken for a year			2
but there are other drugs that might help			2
through his own research , in late 2012 @entity1 came across aimspro , which was being tested for neurological conditions such as @entity13 and multiple sclerosis			1
former @entity53 player @entity52 was taking it for his @entity13 after travelling the world looking for a cure			0
' we figured he 'd be getting the best treatment for the disease , so @entity1 wanted to try it , ' says @entity27			1
new drugs undergo three stages of testing			2
in the first , the drug is given in small doses to healthy patients to check for side - effects ; then it 's given to a larger group of people who have the disease it 's been developed for ; finally , some patients are given larger doses , while others are unknowingly given a placebo			1
the 37 - year - old fire officer and father - of - one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease @entity78 has undergone an ' open label ' clinical trial , a version of this last stage , where patients know they are taking the real drug , not a placebo			1
but it could still take ten years for it to be licensed and prescribed to patients - time that desperately ill patients such as @entity1 do not have			1
what they want is access to drugs such as aimspro before they are licensed			1
however , drug companies are reluctant to allow this , even to dying sufferers , for fear of being sued if patients experience adverse effects or die as a result of taking them			1
@entity78 is available for ' named patient compassionate use ' , meaning a doctor can prescribe the drug where no other is available , although it is still considered experimental and has to be paid for privately			2
furthermore , the doctor bears the risk of being sued , so many are reluctant to do this			0
@entity1 was able to find a doctor who would prescribe the drug , but had to sign a disclaimer to waive his rights to sue if something went wrong			1
he 's since spent all his savings and money raised by well - wishers - a total of £ 50,000 - having the £ 180 - a - day drug injected			1
' i was able to carry on working , albeit in a more administrative role , at the fire station			1
i even ran the @entity122 this year , ' says @entity1 , speaking through @entity27			1
but the drug could only slow progression of the disease , and by summer he could n't use his arms , meaning everyday things such as making a cup of tea were out of reach			1
' but he still believed the drugs were helping , ' says @entity27 who lives with @entity1 and their four - year - old daughter @entity28 in @entity134 , @entity135			1
however , his money has now run out and he 's had to come off the drug - and in the three months since he stopped taking it , he has gone considerably downhill			1
' the muscles in my throat and tongue that help me speak have deteriorated , ' says @entity1			2
' my speech was slightly slurred before , but now it 's worse			2
' walking is n't coming naturally any more - i have to concentrate on how to do it			2
@entity1 with wife @entity27 ' we were recently at a wishing well and @entity28 threw a coin in and wished i had new arms			2
' i 'd love to pick @entity28 up and cuddle her - it 's what i long for			2
' it 's been soul - destroying knowing there 's a drug out there that would help me , but i ca n't have it			1
' now it seems that a new law could soon make @entity1 's wish a reality			1
yesterday it was announced that a @entity161 which would allow terminally - ill patients to be given untested drugs had received government backing			1
the @entity166 , which will go before the @entity167 on friday and is due to be considered by mps in december , would allow doctors to treat people with terminal illnesses - and who have exhausted standard treatment options - with drugs that are unlicensed or have not been tested for their disease			1
the @entity177 would give legal protection to doctors so long as they obtained agreement from another specialist to prescribe drugs or surgery which would n't normally be given for a patient 's condition			2
this would apply to @entity43 and private doctors , meaning that funding would come down to local health authorities , now known as @entity190 , as is the case with standard treatment			0
if passed , the @entity177 could become law in @entity194 and @entity195 by march			0
the @entity177 was proposed by the conservative peer @entity197 , who has led a campaign to change the law after his wife , author @entity201 , died from ovarian cancer , aged 69 , in 2011			0
he argued that current rules are impeding medical progress , forcing doctors to stick to traditional treatments which do n't always work			0
' doctors know if they divert from these well - worn treatment paths and attempt an innovative treatment , and then something goes wrong , they will be found guilty of medical negligence , ' he has said			2
as he told @entity213 yesterday : ' i want every patient who is facing a terminal diagnosis to be able to ask their doctor : ' have you tried everything ? ' and for this @entity177 to allow doctors to say , confidently : ' yes			2
' proportion of people with cancer who take part in clinical trials ' no patient should die thinking more could have been be done , but was n't for fear of the law			0
no husband , wife , son , daughter , mother or father should be forced to say goodbye to a loved one with that doubt hanging over them			2
' @entity237 says she and her husband , who have spoken previously in the @entity239 about the need for the law to change , ' support this @entity177 per cent '			0
' doing nothing is not an option for us			0
sitting here waiting for the @entity246 is not an option			0
we know aimspro works for @entity1 , so that 's the drug we want to try			1
' another patient who could benefit ' hugely ' from the proposed legislation is six - year - old @entity252			2
he has duchenne muscular dystrophy , a terminal and incurable condition that causes muscles to weaken , and he is slowly losing the ability to walk and lift things			0
@entity1 in 2011 with two - year - old @entity28 his mother says there are 43 drugs in development for @entity252 's condition , but none has yet been approved			1
' @entity252 will die from @entity265 , but he could have treatment , ' adds @entity267 , 30 , who lives with her husband @entity268 , 40 , their two - year - old son @entity269 and @entity252 , near @entity271 , @entity272			0
' this new @entity177 would change all that			0
' i 'm not some crazy parent			0
we want to discuss these untested drugs with doctors and make a decision together			1
we 'd be willing to sign a waiver if they would just give us access to these drugs			0
' as a mum , i see these promising drugs dangling in front of me and we ca n't use them			0
@entity252 has said to me : ' @entity288 , when are my legs going to get better ? ' all i can do is tell him @entity288 and @entity290 are working hard to find new treatments			0
' ' i would try these drugs on @entity252			0
i know that might kill him			0
but the risk , for me , is doing nothing			0
my son is going to die anyway			0
' yet some clinicians do n't think the @entity177 is the way forward			0
@entity298 , professor emeritus of surgery at @entity300 , said yesterday : ' changing the law is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy , but might , endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation			0
' and @entity307 , professor of neurology and complex disease genetics at @entity310 , has warned : ' licensed drugs have to go through rigorous trials			2
even if an unlicensed drug works in some way , it might kill you in another way or cause problems			0
' but many patients do n't accept this argument			0
in august the @entity321 said people with @entity323 should be allowed untested drugs ; @entity1 believes the same should apply to other people facing death			1
' i know we ca n't compare having @entity13 to the @entity323 outbreak , but for those of us with a terminal illness , we 're facing a crisis every day			0
' i 'd welcome being used as a guinea pig for untested drugs			1
it might make a difference to others and it would give me a sense of purpose , rather than just fading away			0
