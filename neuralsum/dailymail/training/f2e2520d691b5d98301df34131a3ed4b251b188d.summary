by @entity0 sequenced : the first full @entity2 genome has been sequenced and made available free - of - charge by the @entity4 the first complete neanderthal genome sequence has been completed and made available free - of - charge to researchers across the world			1
scientists from the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , have made the data available as a free download from their website			1
the group will present a paper describing the genome later this year			0
' but we make the genome sequence freely available now to allow other scientists to profit from it even before it is published ' said dr @entity24 , who led the project			2
dr @entity24 and his colleagues in 2010 presented the first draft of the @entity2 genome from data collected from three bones found in a cave in @entity33			1
they have now used a toe bone excavated in 2010 in @entity36 in southern @entity37 to generate a high - quality genome from a single @entity40 individual			1
the @entity11 team used sensitive techniques developed there over the past two years to sequence every position in the genome about 50 times over , using dna extracted from 0.038 grams of the bone			1
the analysis of the genome together with partial genome sequences from other @entity2 , and the genome from a small finger bone discovered in the same cave , shows that the individual is closely related to other neanderthals in @entity56 and western @entity57			1
remarkably , @entity2 and their relatives , @entity58 , were both present in this unique cave in the @entity61 on the border between @entity57 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2
in the 2010 draft version of the neanderthal genome , each position was determined , on average , once			0
in the now - completed version of the genome every position was determined on average 50 times over			1
this allows even the small differences between the copies of genes that this individual inherited from its mother and father to be distinguished			0
this family tree relates this genome ( top ) to the genomes of @entity2 from @entity33 , @entity12 and the @entity84 as well as the @entity58 genome recovered from a finger bone also excavated at @entity87 the neanderthal genome was sequenced thanks to the discovery of just a toe bone , and it was an even tinier fragment of finger that allowed the same researchers to map out the entire genetic code of @entity58 man			1
evidence suggests that the @entity58 , a little - known ancient cousin of modern humans who lived in @entity37 around 50,000 years ago , had dark skin , brown hair and brown eyes			0
the existence of the @entity58 was only confirmed in 2010 , but previous research has already suggested they co-existed with @entity2 and interbred with our own species , @entity102			0
scientists made the discovery after studying @entity47 from a piece of finger bone and two molars found at same @entity36 in the @entity61 of southern @entity37 as the @entity2 toe bone			1
because they had only a tiny sample of material from the finger bone , @entity24 and his research team developed a treatment that unzipped the dna so that each of its two strands can be used to generate molecules for sequencing			0
this method allowed the team to generate an extremely thorough genome sequence ( @entity126 ) , similar in quality to what researchers can obtain for the modern human genome			2
the scientists found that the @entity58 were most genetically similar to @entity133 aborigines and island populations from south - east @entity135			0
the @entity11 group has made the entire genome sequence freely available for the scientific community over the internet			0
' the genome is of very high quality ' , said dr @entity142 , who coordinated the analyses			0
' it matches the quality of the @entity58 genome , presented last year , and is as good as or even better than the multiple present - day human genomes available to date			0
' dr @entity24 added : ' we are in the process of comparing this @entity2 genome to the @entity58 genome as well as to the draft genomes of other @entity2			2
' ' we will gain insights into many aspects of the history of both @entity2 and @entity58 and refine our knowledge about the genetic changes that occurred in the genomes of modern humans after they parted ways with the ancestors of @entity2 and @entity58			1
' the project , part of 30 years ' worth of efforts by dr. @entity24 's group to study ancient dna , was made possible by financing from the @entity4			2
the bone used to sequence the genome was discovered by professor @entity170 and professor @entity171 from the @entity172 in 2010 during excavations at the @entity36			2
the cave is a unique archaeological site which contains cultural layers indicating is has been occupied by humans and our ancestors from as early as 280,000 years ago .			0

scientists from @entity12 's @entity4 sequenced genome from toe bone found in southern @entity37
new techniques allowed them to sequence every position in the genome 50 times over for *greater* *accuracy*
they hope it will help answer *questions* about our own genetic history and how we *'re* related to @entity2
