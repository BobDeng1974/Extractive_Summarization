happy family : @entity6 congressman @entity5 and his wife @entity16 have reunited two - year - old twin girls who were living in separate homes ( bottom right ) by adopting them into their own family grinning girls : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) were living with distant , elderly relations of mrs @entity21 , in separate homes , before they were adopted on august 21 before the adoption was approved on august 21 , the blonde twins were living with distant relations of mr @entity5 's wife @entity16 , in separate but ' very loving ' homes			1
but the relatives , a grandmother and great aunt , had told mrs @entity21 that they hoped they 'd live long enough to see the girls graduate			2
the congressman 's wife approached him several times about adopting the girls , but he told her it was a huge time commitment , and they already had their hands full with two sons , nine and eight , and a five - year - old girl			1
he suggested he write a check , telling her ' it 's easier sometimes to give money than it is to give time			0
' seeking guidance : the congressman , who himself is the youngest of seven , said : ' [ @entity45 ] opened our hearts to the idea of adoption ' ( pictured with wife @entity16 , sons @entity50 and @entity52 , and daughter @entity53 ) but then mrs @entity21 pulled what her husband calls the ' trump card '			2
she asked him : ' would you pray about it ? ' ' how do you pray about that ? ' said congressman @entity5 at a town meeting in @entity62 , @entity6 , last week			1
politician parent : @entity64 @entity5 , 36 , is the @entity65 for @entity6 's 2nd congressional district ' i mean , really			1
" hey lord , would you please , please make her heart as selfish as mine " ? ' so instead he prayed that @entity45 would change his own mind , ' and man did he ever , ' he says			0
the congressman , who himself is the youngest of seven , told @entity75 : ' our family prayed for @entity45 's will and he opened our hearts to the idea of adoption			2
' we were unsure about whether , at this time , we could handle the extra responsibility , ' he added			0
' but @entity45 's timing is always perfect			0
' now the congressman - who is part of the @entity87 nation , just like his twin girls - says @entity10 and @entity9 have taught him more than he ever expected			1
' people say , " man , you 're going to be such a blessing to those girls , " ' he said at the town meeting			0
' and i 'm going to tell you right now - if you 're someone who 's thinking about adoption - you 're going to be blessed more by them than you will ever be a blessing to them			2
' as for the girls themselves , they have apparently been doing well since being reunited			0
' if you talk to anybody , they say twins need to be together			0
the bond between them is just amazing , ' said congressman @entity5			1
