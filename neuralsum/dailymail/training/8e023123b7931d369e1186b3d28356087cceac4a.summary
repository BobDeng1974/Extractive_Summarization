and that 's exactly what twiglet the @entity8 pony is doing after his owner decided to give him free run of the flowerbeds and luscious lawns of @entity13 , near @entity14 in @entity15			1
the 46 - year - old animal - who is thought to be the oldest @entity18 in @entity19 - was feared to be on his last legs before his owner @entity22 decided to let him to stretch his legs in the grounds of the historic former monastery			1
veteran : @entity27 ( pictured here in the grounds of @entity13 , @entity15 , with owner @entity22 's seven - year - old daughter @entity30 ) could be the oldest @entity18 in @entity19 loved : the pony ( pictured here being ridden by @entity30 and led by four - year - old @entity32 , right ) was born in 1966 - the year @entity33 won the football @entity35			1
he has been used to teach dozens of children to ride since then loved : @entity27 has become a popular figure with visitors to @entity13 , in @entity15 ( pictured here again with @entity32 , left , and @entity30 , right ) @entity27 , who was born in 1966 - the year @entity33 won the football @entity35 - has rallied after being given the run of the estate			1
the 46 - year - old - who is way past the average life expectancy for his breed - was literally wasting away as age took its toll and was losing weight so fast owner mrs @entity22 feared he would not live to see another autumn			1
but the pony has flourished since ms @entity22 decided to allow him to feast on the lush grass and choice border flowers in the @entity13 's grounds and gardens			2
thriving : the pony ( again pictured here with @entity32 , front , and @entity30 , riding him ) has flourished since his owners allowed him to roam free in the @entity13 's grounds since making a recovery and putting back on the lost pounds he has become a firm favourite with visitors to the 12th century monastery which was once lived in by monks			1
mrs @entity22 , whose family have owned the estate for the last 70 years , said : ' we pride ourselves on our gardens and normally they would be sacrosanct but we had to do something for @entity27			2
' we felt a few hoof prints on the grass or a few nibbled plants would be worth it for his sake , ' she said			0
' he ’s been such a big part of our lives since we took him in when his former owner died			0
' mrs @entity22 said all of her children have learned to ride on @entity27 who she said is ' gorgeous , like a big dog really			2
' ' at first , we had some well meaning visitors who kept reporting there was an escaped pony in the gardens , ' she said			2
' we reassured them he had deliberately been turned out and why			0
' now , we ’ve attached a little notice to a tree stump explaining who he is , how old he is and why he is there			0
' mrs @entity22 said @entity27 had proved very popular and that people have come back to visit the @entity13 and check on his progress			1
' i knew he would n’t be able to escape or at least not get far if he did because he had severe laminitis a few years ago and it ’s agonising for him to put his feet onto the hard drive or road , ' she said			0
' grass is just the thing			0
' new life : @entity27 , pictured here being fed by @entity32 , was losing weight before being allowed to stretch his legs in the @entity13 's grounds affection : the @entity112 say that sacrificing the odd flowerbed for @entity27 's happiness has been well worth it ( @entity116 is pictured hugging @entity27 in front of the @entity13 ) mrs @entity22 said the family do not fence @entity27 in , allowing him instead to wander at will			1
' sometimes there is the odd pile of something for us to clear up , ' she said , ' but it ’s a small price to pay and we put it on the flower beds			0
' the roses looked particularly good this year			0
' dressing up : @entity27 is dressed for battle at a fancy dress competition			0
he is seen here being ridden by @entity127 , 10 , and with @entity0 's father @entity128 ( right ) ten years ago : @entity27 braves the cold weather soon after being brought to @entity13 ( pictured here being ridden by @entity130 - then aged three )			1

@entity27 has thrived since being allowed to roam the grounds of @entity13
his owner moved him there after the elderly pony began to lose weight
he has become a popular *attraction* for visitors to the site in @entity15
@entity27 was born in 1966 - the year @entity33 won the football @entity35
