bike helmets are the latest product to get the ‘ smart ’ upgrade			2
a team of students has devised a helmet with built - in sensors and smartphone functionality to provide data after a crash			1
the so - called ‘ black box ’ helmet can also call emergency services , talk to the cyclist and provide hands - free calling			1
the ' black box ' has accelerometers and sensors to work out what happened			2
it also records the rider 's distance , speed and direction at all times the helmet was devised by students at @entity17 in partnership with @entity18			1
its potentially live - saving features include accelerometers , speakers , a microphone and an led headlamp			0
together the features provide the rider with information while cycling , or data in the event of an accident			0
in the event of a crash the helmet will also talk to the rider and ask if they are okay			0
if they say ‘ yes ’ or fail to respond , emergency services will be contacted on their behalf			2
using a synced smartphone as well , the rider can be put through a few quick medical tests to see if they might be badly hurt			0
all of the data from the crash can then be studied after to understand what happened			0
the helmet syncs with an app that can provide medical questions to the rider after a crash or call emergency services by asking the rider questions via a speaker ( shown above the @entity68 headlamp )			1
and the helmet can also play music or allow for hands - free calling inside the 3d - printed outer shell is a regular bike helmet ( shown )			1
the product is only in the prototype phase at the moment so no potential release date or price has been announced - @entity79 radio - @entity81 - @entity82 - two accelerometers to detect a sudden impact - communications hardware to call pre-set emergency contact number - above - the - ear speakers - microphone - @entity68 headlight the helmet syncs with an @entity92 app on smartphones to transfer data			1
this includes distance , speed and the direction a rider has taken			2
the main feature , though , is to know what happened after a crash			0
‘ if my kids get into a crash , we will never know what happened , ’ said @entity103 , a technologist and architect in the @entity105 for @entity18 , to @entity106			0
‘ did they hit their heads ? did they get really injured ? because when they come back [ after biking ] they just say “ i got hurt , ” so we are n’t really sure how bad it was			0
‘ could we build something that would help us understand ; [ and ] if a crash happens , the helmet can act like a black box ? ’ in addition the technology built into the helmet , such as the microphone and speakers , it has other functions too			2
for example , the speakers can be used to play music without covering the rider ’s ears or for hands - free calling			1
the circuitry is stored in the back of the helmet ( the white section in the image above )			0
the technology built into the helmet , such as the microphone and speakers , has other functions as well			0
for example , the speakers can be used to play music without covering the rider ’s ears or for hands - free calling			1
the product , recently shown off by the students involved , is only in the prototype phase at the moment so no potential release date or price has been announced			1
