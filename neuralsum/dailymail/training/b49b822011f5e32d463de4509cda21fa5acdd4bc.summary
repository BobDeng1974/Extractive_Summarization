@entity0 ? witnessing @entity1 by @entity2 we know that it was not until wednesday , june 21 , 1815 , three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern - day @entity8 , that news of the @entity1 reached @entity11			1
the prime minister , lord @entity13 , was dining with friends when the exhausted figure of major @entity17 burst in , carrying two captured @entity20 imperial eagle standards			1
@entity13 immediately insisted on going to see the @entity21 , the future @entity22 , who was also dining nearby			1
the @entity21 was naturally delighted , but hoped that ‘ we have not suffered much loss ’			1
went @entity24 ? witnessing @entity1 by @entity2 ‘ the loss has been very great indeed , ’ said @entity25 sadly			1
the @entity21 promptly burst into tears			1
the @entity1 is one of the great narrative set pieces in our entire history			1
the details are irresistible : @entity33 ’s flight from @entity34 ; the @entity36 officers dancing in @entity37 ; the @entity20 emperor ’s arrogant confidence ; @entity41 ’s grim determination ; the gruelling clash in the @entity8 mud ; the final charge of the @entity45 ; the last - gasp , @entity47 - style intervention of @entity49 ’s @entity48			2
but it is a familiar story , which historians have told over and over again			2
how refreshing it is , then , to read @entity2 ’s magnificent book , by far the most enjoyable account of the battle i have ever encountered			1
most military histories are a bit like football books , bogged down in the detail of groin strains and offside decisions — or rather , troop dispositions and artillery mechanics — without ever managing to make you care			2
but @entity2 has had the brilliant idea of interweaving a fast , colourful narrative of the battle with the story of what was happening in @entity36 that drizzly sunday , june 18			1
his book is not just a military history ; it is a social and cultural panorama , taking in everything from murderers and vicars to portrait - painters and prize - fighters			1
in his introduction , he compares it with @entity81 ’s famous painting @entity82 , in which the painter ’s stolid labourers plough in the foreground while @entity86 plunges to his death far in the distance			0
but in a sense he is selling himself short , because his book is much more entertaining than that sounds			0
much of the action takes place hundreds of miles from @entity1			1
we meet an extraordinary range of cultural superstars , from the talented but troubled writer @entity96 , who stabbed her mother to death during a bout of madness , to the pamphleteer @entity102 , the ancestor of today ’s newspaper columnists , who claimed that ‘ a man must be a good hater ’			0
but @entity2 also plunges us deep into @entity106 , ‘ a world of prize - fighting , carriage - racing , bull - baiting , mail - coach driving , badger - drowning and the great clown @entity113 ’			1
as his characters move through the day , from the early hours to midnight , @entity2 gently cranks up the tension			0
even as the armies are preparing for battle , he whisks us off to the @entity119 isle of @entity120 , where a poor teenage mother is abandoning her stillborn child by the road			1
as @entity41 ’s men take up their positions , @entity2 takes us to @entity126 , where children are gathering for their weekly sunday school class			0
a s the bullets are flying and thousands of men are drowning in their own blood , the narrative switches to @entity134 , where day - trippers have come to watch a jousting tournament to mark the 600th anniversary of @entity138			2
all the time there is the almost unbearable sense that everybody is waiting — waiting for news of the battle that they know will decide the @entity145			1
@entity2 makes a persuasive case that this long struggle , just like the world wars of the 20th century , was a ‘ total war ’			0
for two decades , the struggle against the @entity20 had been the defining issue of our national life			0
little wonder the tension hung heavy that sunday			0
in one of countless beautifully observed moments , @entity2 describes the great moral reformer and anti-slavery campaigner @entity159 , leading his children to church			2
‘ perhaps at this very moment , ’ @entity159 said to them as they walked , ‘ when we are walking thus in peace together to the @entity165 , our brave fellows may be fighting hard in @entity8			0
oh how grateful we should be for all @entity168 ’s goodness to us ! ’ we know that it was not until wednesday , june 21 , 1815 , three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern - day @entity8 , that news of the @entity1 reached @entity11 against this background , the suffering of @entity41 ’s men is all the more striking			1
@entity2 has a superb eye for fascinating little nuggets , such as the fact that nobody at the battle knew what time it was , since in those pre-railway timetable days , even those men who wore watches had them all set slightly differently			1
but he is also very good at the blood and guts			0
one memorable passage describes the last moments of the boxer @entity191 — then , @entity2 thinks , the most famous soldier in the army — who , steaming with pre-match booze , smashed a @entity20 officer ’s head in two with his sword , bashed two more opponents ’ brains out and was finally cornered against a wall by a great mob of @entity20			2
another describes the extraordinary stoicism of @entity41 ’s cavalry commander @entity204 , whose leg was shot away and had to be amputated on the field of battle			2
there was no anaesthetic in those days , but @entity210 remained remarkably jolly even as the doctor was beginning to slice away			2
at one stage , the saw got stuck in the bone			0
‘ damn the saw ! ’ said the doctor , at which @entity210 , said cheerfully : ‘ what is the matter ? ’ the real heroes of @entity2 ’s book , though , are the ordinary , nameless soldiers , the men from @entity222 and @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 , who gave their lives to bring down @entity33 ’s empire			0
one lovely story says it all			0
a few days before the battle , @entity41 met @entity232 , a visiting @entity36 politician , in the park in @entity37			1
@entity232 asked if @entity33 could be beaten			0
at that , @entity41 pointed to a small figure in the distance : a @entity36 infantryman in his red coat , peering at the park ’s statues			0
‘ there , ’ the great man said			2
‘ there , it all depends upon that article whether we do the business or not			0
give me enough of it , and i am sure			0
’ and he was , of course , magnificently right .			0

it was *n't* until three days after the @entity1 , in june 1815 , that the news reached @entity11
the battle is one of the great narrative pieces set in our history
