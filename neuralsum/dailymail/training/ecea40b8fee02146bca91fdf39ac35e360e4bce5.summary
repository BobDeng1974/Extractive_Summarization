@entity1 boss @entity0 will be taking a huge selection gamble if he opts to fill his problem centre - pairing with @entity5 ’s @entity4 for the forthcoming autumn internationals , admits @entity8 winner @entity7			1
while the majority of his starting xv all but picks itself , @entity9 continues to roll the dice at 12 and 13 , with a combination of injuries and erratic form seeing a number of options fill the @entity1 centre roles			1
in the last 12 months @entity0 has handed starts to @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 and still he seems uncertain of his premier midfield combination			2
@entity1 head coach @entity26 ( centre ) issues instructions to his players during training @entity1 backs coach @entity31 ( centre ) is surrounded by a huddle as he talks to the squad @entity5 's @entity4 ( front ) celebrates scoring a try against @entity37 earlier this month a groin injury will see @entity40 @entity39 miss the autumn tests , while @entity42 is also struggling with injury , meaning @entity4 is now in pole position to stake his claim			1
the @entity5 man has started the season in impressive form but during the summer tour to @entity51 his defensive work was questioned , particularly in the third test against the @entity51 that saw him hauled off at half - time			1
there ’s no doubting @entity4 ’s class with ball in hand or his ability to make yards in attack but @entity7 admits there are serious questions marks that need erasing from his defensive game			2
' one of @entity0 ’s main worries is around that centre pairing because obviously his potential first - choice centre partnership ( @entity24 and @entity23 ) is banged up , ' said @entity7 , speaking at the launch of this year ’s @entity70 at @entity42 ’s @entity71			1
' does he go with @entity4 who can be absolutely devastating in attack but who was fundamentally found out in defence on the summer tour ? @entity77 ( centre ) runs with the ball during the @entity1 training session at @entity81 on wednesday @entity1 's @entity82 ( left ) and @entity83 ( second left ) arrive for training ' i ’ve seen him play at @entity5 and it ’s an area of his game that he has worked on			1
he was more disappointed than anyone else over the summer and it ’s about fitting into the team and getting used to playing at the highest level			0
' @entity4 is a @entity92 - style player , so i think he should be paired with someone like @entity20 who is solid and steady or @entity22 who is even more solid and steady			2
' it ’s a tricky one for @entity0 and there is also someone like @entity97 pushing for game - time , but there are some good conundrums for him			0
' @entity1 @entity8 winning coach sir @entity101 has called on @entity37 ’ playmaker @entity102 – @entity9 ’s current first choice fly - half – to be given an extended run in the @entity105			1
it seems unlikely @entity0 will move @entity31 though this autumn , meaning one of @entity22 or @entity20 will likely start in the autumn			0
@entity7 admits he can see the sense in opting for a tried and trusted approach of @entity22 or @entity20 in midfield but insists neither are the long - term solution to @entity9 ’s centre conundrum			2
he added : ' @entity20 really controls a game well and he ’s taken his chances in an @entity1 shirt , so i think he deserves to be in the squad			0
@entity1 's @entity102 catches the ball as the squad prepare for the autumn internationals @entity1 @entity8 winner @entity7 pictured at the launch of the 2014 - 15 @entity70 in @entity123 ' but he ’s not the future going forward for @entity1 – i think he ’s a short - term solution			1
however , @entity0 knows that @entity20 will do a job for him if he ’s needed and there ’s value to that			0
' it ’s a similar situation to @entity22 – neither of them are the answer but they are secure , solid players who can do a job and that ’s maybe what @entity0 needs in this first game against the best team in the world			0
' @entity51 will be coming up against them and not holding back so perhaps safety first is not a bad approach			0
' be part of the rugby family at the @entity145 at @entity146 , @entity42 on sunday 22 march			0

@entity8 winner @entity7 reckons it would be a gamble for @entity0 to fill his problem centre - pairing with @entity5 's @entity4
a groin injury will see @entity24 miss the autumn tests
@entity1 take on @entity51 at @entity155 on *november* 8
