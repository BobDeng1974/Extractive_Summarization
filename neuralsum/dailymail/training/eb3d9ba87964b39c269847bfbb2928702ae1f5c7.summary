by @entity0 published : 14:25 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 07:27 est , 3 march 2014 the man branded @entity4 's most violent prisoner has abandoned his sketch pad in protest after prison guards banned him from sending drawings to friends			1
@entity10 , who was imprisoned for life after threatening to kill an art teacher in 1999 , has become a prolific artist since first being jailed for armed robbery in 1974			1
controversially , his surreal multicoloured drawings have sold for up to Â£ 1,000 and been displayed in galleries across @entity17 and the south east			0
upset : @entity10 proclaimed he will no longer draw ( one of his pieces right ) if he can not share his work his ' @entity22 ' - the @entity23 - features the prisoner lying on a hammock in bright colours his surreal images , mostly depicting his 40 years behind bars , have sold for thousands of pounds over the years the 61 - year - old has spent the last 40 years in jail - save just four months and nine days between crimes - with 36 of those years spend in solitary confinement due to his ' aggression ' and serial hostage taking			1
during his time in solitary , @entity10 's ' greatest pleasure ' was sketching and painting hundreds of artworks , many of which depict his life ' inside his cage '			2
the pieces have attracted praise , winning him 11 awards from the @entity47 , a prison arts charity			1
one painting has even been displayed at @entity49 in @entity17 - a move that provoked sharp criticism from the @entity52			0
but on wednesday , @entity10 proclaimed he has stopped drawing after prison chiefs at maximum security @entity54 in @entity56 banned him from sending work out because it is being sold on ' for a profit '			1
members of the @entity61 claim his work supports charities and helps him calm down many of the works are cartoons that tell the story of his numerous crimes , including detaining an art teacher he has received acclaim for his sketches , with one of his works ( right ) displayed at @entity74 , @entity17 supporters of @entity10 - whose donated pictures have raised tens of thousands of pounds for charities - have warned there could be consequences if he is now sitting idle in his cell with nothing to do			1
a spokesman for the @entity83 said on wednesday : ' we have a very important message from @entity86			0
' according to @entity54 staff , someone wrote in saying they had sold a piece of his art for charity			1
' subsequently , they stopped anything containing art from going out			2
' @entity86 has asked us to let people know that he will not be writing any more letters at all , and is sending no mail while this is the case			0
' he now has even more time on his hands as he is not doing any art or writing or replying to letters			2
' we 'd like to ask the obvious - that people do n't write to @entity86 asking for art or advising him of art sold			2
it may be for the best of intentions but does not help @entity86 in his position			0
' despite being in maximum security @entity54 in @entity56 , he has recently been deemed less violent it is the second time @entity10 , who spent 36 years in solitary confinement , is banned from sharing his work dozens of his paintings were approved by @entity115 to hang in underground stations the convict , who has spent just four months and nine days free since 1974 , claims his violence is behind him @entity121 's 2009 portrayal showed a violent streak , that supporters warn could be provoked by the ban it is the second time @entity54 officials have barred @entity10 from sending out his work , after a brief ban in 2010			1
whenever he is banned from drawing he is known to take ' a turn for the worse ' , supporters claim			0
despite being held at maximum security @entity54 in @entity56 , the muscle - bound convict , who is said to do 2,000 push - ups a day , claims his violent days ended more than a decade ago - and recently passed a @entity134			1
however , supporters are worried the ban will set him on edge			0
a source said : ' @entity86 uses art and writing as a way to relax - he needs to be creative to keep a lid on things , so this ban is not helpful at all			0
' writing recently , @entity10 said : ' my days of violence and crime ended well over a decade ago			0
' i could make a good living out of my art. '			0
