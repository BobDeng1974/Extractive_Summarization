forget points on the board , it ’s about followers on the web these days			0
at least , that is , according to @entity7 executive vice-chairman @entity6			2
the @entity9 chief made the bizarre attempt to satisfy investors this week by highlighting the impact signing for the club has had on the social - media popularity of players such as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
@entity7 's @entity16 has had a 73 per cent increase in @entity21 followers since joining the club in the case of @entity23 , @entity6 pointed to his 73 per cent increase in @entity21 followers , a figure which equates to 173,000			1
however , if @entity16 ’s motivation for joining @entity7 was simply to maximise ‘ retweets ’ and ‘ favourites ’ , perhaps he should have signed for @entity29 , @entity30 or @entity31			1
for @entity32 can reveal the big winners of this summer ’s @entity34			0
we have obtained numbers from @entity21 which disclose the growth in following for close - season signings from each @entity40 club			1
@entity29 midfielder @entity41 has attracted 900,000 followers since his £ 30million switch from @entity44 @entity30 striker @entity45 has added 462,000 followers since his £ 16million switch and we can reveal that it is @entity29 ’s @entity41 who has attracted the most new followers since his £ 30million move from @entity44			1
the @entity53 ’s numbers are up by 900,000 , taking his total to 7.42m			0
@entity45 , meanwhile , has added 462,000 in the wake of his arrival at @entity30			0
@entity6 , however , may well point to percentage increase as a true barometer of social - media success and @entity16 – at 73 per cent – still outdoes @entity41 ( 14 per cent ) and @entity45 ( 16 per cent )			1
but none of those three can compete with the 203 per cent rise enjoyed by @entity63 following his move from @entity65 to @entity31			1
@entity66 defender @entity63 ( second left ) has a 203 per cent rise since joining @entity31 @entity68 has 28,000 followers on @entity21 - a 197 per cent rise since joining the @entity71 @entity7 midfielder posted this picture to his twitter account on thursday afternoon the 19 - year - old is up from 84,000 to 255,000 in just four months – now those figures really would have @entity78 purring			1
but @entity79 is n’t alone in recording a three - figure percentage jump			0
@entity68 ’s @entity81 is up 197 per cent to 28,000			0
the 21 - year - old - a previous unknown in the @entity84 second tier - has scored three times in his last three matches to announce his arrival on the @entity40 stage following a £ 1.6m move from @entity90			0
@entity92 defender @entity91 notched for @entity93 against @entity94 on tuesday night and he is another enjoying new - found notoriety , the former @entity97 youngster seeing his following rocket 123 per cent to just over 12,000			0
@entity91 ( left ) and @entity99 have seen their @entity21 following increase triple-fold @entity99 , at @entity102 , is up 150 per cent to 44,000 , while @entity104 ’s @entity103 has nearly trebled his following			1
other summer signings have not been quite as lucky , @entity106 ’s @entity105 has only attracted 2,900 , while @entity109 ’s @entity108 has added just 1,500			2
but does any of the above really matter in comparison to @entity40 points ? only at @entity9 , it seems … @entity105 ( right ) has only attracted an extra 2,900 followers since moving to @entity106			2

@entity16 has had a 73 per cent rise increase in his @entity21 since joining @entity7 this season
@entity41 has attracted the most followers this summer with 900,000
@entity31 's @entity63 has had a 203 per cent rise on @entity21 up to 255,000 followers since joining from @entity65
