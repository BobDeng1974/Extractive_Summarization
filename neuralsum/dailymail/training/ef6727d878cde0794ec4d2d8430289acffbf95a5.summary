by @entity1 reporter published : 08:59 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 12:13 est , 13 may 2013 as abbreviations go , the @entity2 's has got to be among the most unfortunate			1
but this did n't stop members of the former @entity7 rebel group from patrolling the jungles of the @entity9 today ahead of the country 's contentious general elections			2
@entity2 joins countless other organisations with unfortunate acronyms - such as @entity14 , the @entity15			1
@entity2 is a splinter group of @entity7 rebels from the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) formed in the 1960s to achieve greater @entity32 autonomy in the southern @entity9			1
it has used terrorist tactics to try and force greater independence on the region and declared a jihad against the government , its citizens and supporters			1
@entity2 , which was officially formed in the 1980s , has also been linked to @entity40 and a bombing incident in @entity42 in 2003			1
in march 2007 , the @entity9 government offered to recognize the right of self - determination for the @entity32 people which it had never done in three decades of conflict			1
the @entity50 @entity2 joins one of many organisations around the world with unfortunate acronyms but later that year in july , @entity56 militants in @entity57 in the southern @entity9 killed 14 marines			1
@entity2 denied responsibility for the murders			1
this delayed the start of the peace process but milf and the @entity9 government took the first tentative steps last year toward ending one of @entity67 's longest - running insurgencies			1
both parties signed a preliminary peace pact with a roadmap to a final peace settlement expected by 2016			1
as part of the arrangement , @entity2 is responsible for maintaining peace on @entity76 island to prevent civil unrest during the congressional and local elections in the @entity9			1
more than 52 million voters registered to elect 18,000 officials , including half of the 24 - member @entity83 , nearly 300 members of the @entity85 and leaders of a @entity7 autonomous region in the south , where @entity56 insurgents and militants are a concern			2
task force : @entity2 is a @entity93 located in the southern @entity9 which now has the agreement with the @entity9 government to maintain peace in @entity76 island despite scattered killings and fears of fraud , the polls were relatively peaceful as soldiers and police secured stations in potentially violent areas			1
the outcome will determine the level of support for president @entity108 's reforms in his remaining three years in office			2
@entity108 has been praised at home and abroad for cracking down on widespread corruption , backing key legislation and concluding an initial peace agreement with @entity7 rebels - including @entity2			1
but he can not run for re-election and a choice of his successor , who will be expected to continue on the same reform path , will depend on the new political landscape			0
candidates backed by @entity108 are running against a coalition headed by vice president @entity122 and deposed president @entity123			0
peace keepers : @entity2 has helped keep election day violence down to an all time low although officially no. 2 in the country , @entity122 has emerged as the administration 's rival and may be positioning himself for the 2016 presidential race			1
among 33 senatorial candidates are two of @entity108 's relatives , @entity122 's neophyte daughter , @entity123 's son , a son of the sitting chamber president , a son of a late president , a spouse and children of former senators and there 's a possibility that two siblings will be sitting in the same house			0
currently , 15 senators have relatives serving in elective positions			0
the race for the @entity85 is even more of a family affair			0
toppled dictator @entity153 ' widow , the flamboyant 83 - year - old @entity152 , is expected to keep her seat as a representative for @entity157 province , the husband 's birthplace where the locals kept electing the @entity161 despite allegations of corruption and abuse during their long rule			2
@entity153 ' daughter , @entity166 is seeking re-election as governor and the son , @entity171 , is already a senator			0
boxing star and incumbent rep. @entity174 is running unopposed and building a dynasty of his own : his brother @entity176 is running to represent his southern district and his wife @entity178 is vying to become vice-governor for @entity181 province			0
@entity123 , who was ousted in a 2001 ' people power ' revolt on corruption allegations , is running for mayor of @entity186 , hoping to capitalize on his movie star popularity , particularly among the poor masses			0
@entity9 elections have long been dominated by politicians belonging to the same bloodlines			0
at least 250 political families have monopolized power across the country , although such dynasties are prohibited under the 1987 constitution			0
@entity197 - long controlled by members of powerful clans targeted by the constitutional ban - has failed to pass the law needed to define and enforce the provision			2
geared up : members of the armed group @entity2 will continue top patrol throughout the day			1
the election results will return within the next two days critics worry that a single family 's stranglehold on different levels of government could stymie checks against abuses and corruption			2
a widely cited example is the 2009 massacre of 58 people , including 32 media workers , in an ambush blamed on rivalry between powerful clans in southern @entity223 province			0
in the latest violence , gunmen killed five people and wounded two mayoral candidates in separate attacks over the weekend			0
last month , gunmen fired on a truck carrying a town mayor and his supporters in southern @entity234 province , killing 13 people including his daughter			0
the 125,000 - strong military has helped the government in urging candidates to shun violence			2
an army general took off with his troops aboard two helicopters and dropped leaflets calling for peaceful elections in @entity246 , a central province notorious for political killings			0
results are expected within a day or two			0
more than 52 million voters are registered to vote in the general election across the country			0

@entity2 is tasked with peace keeping in @entity76
its acronym joins other unfortunate abbreviations - such as @entity14 , the @entity15
but despite its name , @entity2 is a deadly serious organisation
