an @entity1 couple who nursed an injured fawn back to health more than two years ago is now facing jail time after refusing to leave the animal to die			1
@entity7 police officer @entity6 says that it was a little more than two years ago while on patrol that he discovered the tiny deer curled up on a neighbor ’s front porch , badly wounded and unable to stand			1
without time to help it himself , he called his wife , a registered nurse , who cautiously approached the deer with their teenaged daughter before experiencing the fawn gently licking their hands			2
unbeknownst to them at the time , however , was that bringing the animal home with them was illegal according to the state 's @entity25 , with the crime punishable by jail			2
punishing : an @entity1 couple are facing criminal charges after they nursed this fawn back to health after finding it badly wounded near their home good intentions : @entity6 and @entity37 , pictured , brought the deer home , naming it @entity40 , in hopes of one day releasing it back into the wild ' i could feel all of the open wounds all along her back side and she would n't stand up , ' @entity37 told @entity47 of that day back in 2010			1
she described the deer as having puncture wounds along its hips from a possible coyote attack			2
the wounds she said were maggot infested			0
if they left the animal there it would surely die , she reasoned			0
that was the exact suggestion the @entity25 offered them when they were contacted			2
the @entity25 told them to take the animal out into the woods and leave it there , allowing nature to take its course ' she would have laid there and starved to death and had a miserable death , ' mrs @entity7 told the @entity68			2
repercussions : the couple are accused of illegally possessing a white - tailed deer , a misdemeanor offense punishable with up to 60 days in jail and a fine up to $ 500 instead they took the animal back to their 17 - acre farm and began caring for her , starting with a small bottle of goats milk , while giving her the name of @entity40			1
today the @entity25 say what they did two years ago was illegal with it being a misdemeanour offense to possess a white - tailed deer			1
it 's a crime that faces the family with a maximum of 60 days in jail and a fine up to $ 500			0
the @entity91 say the newly pressed charge comes after a six - month investigation by the department which included a half a dozen visits to their home and calls to local authorities			0
the family says they did n’t know at the time that it was illegal to keep the deer			0
when this was informed , the solution offered to them was to euthanize it with the deer said to be posing a safety threat to humans			1
‘ i was devastated , ’ mrs @entity37 told @entity47 of her reaction			2
‘ i spent a year and several months nursing her into adulthood , getting to the point where she was able to go out on her own			0
human threat : the @entity25 told them , @entity6 pictured , that they have to euthanize the deer with it now being a potential threat to human health ‘ no matter what the law is , we did what was right for the animal , ’ she said , adding that they planned to release the animal back into the woods once it was fully recovered			1
on the day of @entity40 ’s scheduled execution , however , they found the deer gone			1
the door to her outdoor enclosure was found hanging open			0
an incident report filed by the @entity25 lists @entity37 ’s 80 - year - old father as a suspect in the animal ’s release , according to the @entity68 , but that ’s an allegation mrs @entity37 says they can not prove			1
the family says they did n't have a hand in @entity40 's escape but admit that they also did n't try too hard to find out how it happened			2
mr @entity6 only reasons that @entity40 had a good number of friends : ' she was very popular			1
' not backing down : mr @entity6 , a police officer , and his wife @entity149 , a nurse , plan to fight the charge against them just because of principal while the deer has since been freed into the wild deer or no deer , with the ongoing criminal charge the family says they plan to fight their alleged crime , even though court fees could reach $ 5,000 , ten - times more than the threatened fine			1
‘ sometimes , it 's not always about the @entity25 laws , ’ mrs @entity37 said			1
‘ sometimes it 's about common sense and what 's right in @entity168 's eyes			0
and that 's what i 'm going to stand for			0
’ they also reason jail being an unlikely ending for them if found guilty			0
among national reaction to the @entity91 ' charges , a @entity175 page has since been set up in support of the family – currently seeing more than 9,500 likes – as well as a petition to drop the charges on @entity183			0
the petition reports a little more than 6,700 signatures as of tuesday morning but short by roughly 700 claimed needed			0
the case could go to court next month for a jury trial .			0
