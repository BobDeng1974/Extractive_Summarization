an amazing image showing a collection of stars and nebulae has been released by the @entity4			1
in the colourful picture star clusters , emission nebulae and active star - forming regions are seen at a distance of about 4,000 light - years			1
the image is the most detailed view of this part of the sky , the southern constellation of @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , ever taken			2
scroll down for a video zooming in to the region this image , taken by @entity18 on the @entity19 at @entity20 , shows a section of the @entity23 stellar association			0
in the centre of the image is the young open cluster @entity27 , and to the right is the emission nebula @entity29 , illuminated by the ionising radiation emitted by the brightest nearby stars the image was created using the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) at the @entity4 ’s ( @entity4 ’s ) @entity20 in @entity34			1
at the centre of the image is an open star cluster called @entity27 , which contains about 30 bright stars			2
a nebula , which comes from the @entity40 word for ‘ cloud ’ , is a region of gas and dust in space			0
some are the remains of dead stars that have expelled their gas , whereas others are regions where new stars are being formed			0
they come in a variety of shapes and sizes			0
there are four main types : planetary nebulae , reflection nebulae , absorption nebulae and emission nebulae			0
the two brightest are extremely hot and giant stars , which provide illumination for a nearby emission nebula called the @entity66 , or @entity29			2
this includes the extremely @entity68 , at the centre , which is likely to actually be a pair of stars that are extremely close to each other			0
the reddish glow comes from giant clouds of hydrogen , which are lit up by the intense ultraviolet light from the cluster of hot young stars in the middle of the picture			2
they are spread over a region known as the @entity23 association , which continues outside the limits of this picture - and is a region of similar hot and bright stars that formed at the same time			2
the blue colouration is scattered light from these stars , while the brown darker features are huge clouds of cosmic dust , which absorb the light			0
the @entity97 is towards the right - centre of the image , and is the prominent wall of dark and bright clouds that provides a border to an active star - forming region called @entity104 108			1
the nebula is about 300 light - years long and contains young stars that formed as recently as a few million years ago - a blink of an eye in cosmic terms			1
at the centre of the image is an open star cluster called @entity27 , while on the right is the @entity66			0
move the slider to see labels for the image the image was taken using the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , shownn , at the @entity4 ’s @entity20 in @entity34 the image is the most detailed view of this part of the sky so far , in the southern constellation of @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , shown here the entire image was created by combining more than 500 individual pictures taken through four colour filters with the @entity19			1
the total exposure time was more than 56 hours			0
‘ a great deal of computer work was needed to combine the many individual pictures and make this detailed colour view from them , ’ a spokesperson for the @entity4 told @entity129			1
‘ this is a great image for studying what goes on in star formation regions , and how the young stars interact with their surroundings - and also trigger the next generation of star birth			1

a *telescope* array in @entity34 has *captured* the most detailed image ever made of a portion of the southern sky
in the image can be seen clusters , star - forming regions and nebulae , including the 300 light - year - long @entity29
young and hot stars are also seen at the centre of the *composite* image , which combines 500 different pictures
' this is a great image for studying what goes on in star formation regions , ' an @entity4 spokesperson told @entity129
