' drugged ' : @entity1 prisoner @entity0 a @entity3 inmate has described how he is still being subjected to horrific treatment at the notorious jail despite being cleared for release four years ago			1
@entity0 told how he had been drugged , threatened with rape and forced to watch videos of other detainees being abused at the prison in @entity11 which @entity12 has promised – but so far failed – to close down			1
the @entity1 has been imprisoned for nearly 13 years after being accused of serving in @entity14 ’s security detail			1
he was cleared for release in 2009 but remains in the @entity17 detention facility with 135 other inmates			1
mr @entity0 released a first - person account of his experience inside @entity3 through his lawyers			1
he said he was subjected to ‘ dirty and sadistic ’ abuse by guards who took turns trampling over his back and forced him to watch pornography , which is against his @entity30 beliefs			1
the inmate wrote that his story ‘ starts and ends in the silence of a tiny , freezing cold cell , alone ’			2
his account , published by @entity37 , continued : ‘ the cell door opens			1
the next session , seemingly the 100th in a row			2
i think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months			2
' two teams of interrogators running shifts , day and night			0
each session begins with shouting , to wake me up			0
then they hit me on the face and the back			1
i am so desperate for sleep , my head is swimming			0
’ mr @entity0 described how the room he was in had photographs of faces stuck to the walls			1
‘ they demand that i identify the individuals , but i can barely focus to see if i might know them			0
‘ the shouting and the insults get louder , and then they nod to a man in the corner			0
he injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance			0
it ’s the last thing i know			0
’ the inmate also described how the guards had entered his cell , ‘ making awful honking noises , like wild animals ’			2
he added : ‘ i tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me , in protest at all this			0
truth : a @entity17 @entity79 report revealed the horrifying scale of torture operations at @entity3 , pictured ' the interrogator laughs at me , but then turns angry ; he swears loudly , and pours an army meal pack over my head			1
they tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously			0
he inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed			0
’ mr @entity0 continued : ‘ the cell door opens			1
this time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back			1
‘ i tell the interrogators that i ca n’t face not eating any more			0
they throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig			0
they wo n’t let me go to the restroom			0
they watch as it gets more painful , and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if i pee in my pants			1
’ on another occasion , he said , the guards took him to ‘ a sort of cinema room ’			2
he added : ‘ i have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused			2
inmates were made to stand in stress positions , and some were waterboarded and ' rectally infused ' ' then they tell me that i have to dance for them , and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains			0
every time i try and refuse , they touch me in my most private areas			0
’ mr @entity0 said that four years ago , his case had been reviewed by six @entity17 security agencies			1
‘ their conclusion ? that i was innocent of any crime and should be released			2
‘ @entity17 can not keep hiding from its past , and its present , like this			1
our stories , and our continued detention , can not be made to disappear			0
