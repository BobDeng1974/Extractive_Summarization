scientists have been forced to invent monitoring technology to protect dolphins from being killed while swimming through military training waters , it was revealed today			2
conservationists feared the bottlenose dolphins were at risk from laser - guided missiles when their family pods swim into @entity11 explosive trials at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but a team of experts at defence firm @entity15 created a special listening system to find the dolphins - and can now hear their distinctive clicking sounds from more than 20 miles away			1
worries : conservationists feared the bottlenose dolphins were at risk from laser guided missiles when their family pods swim into @entity11 explosive trials at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 and thanks to the company ’s @entity32 ( @entity35 ) system , when a pod of dolphins is heard entering a missile testing area , all firing is stopped to let them pass through safely			1
the detection of marine life in the area had previously relied on remote camera systems and visual observations by aircrew , because nobody else can enter the area during a missile trial			2
but @entity35 uses an underwater microphone known as a hydrophone and processing equipment to identify the sounds made by marine mammals , which @entity15 says is robust and cost - effective			1
the system has been in use for two years at the @entity11 testing zone , which is a conservation area and has the largest population of protected bottlenose dolphins in @entity57			1
they are also one of only two significant populations in @entity60			0
it is an offence under existing law to deliberately kill , injure or disturb @entity57 marine protected species			0
a @entity66 spokesman told @entity67 : ' animals do not wage war , so why should they suffer because humans do ? system : @entity35 uses an underwater microphone known as a hydrophone and processing equipment to identify the sounds made by marine mammals , which @entity15 says is robust and cost - effective ' wars are human endeavours , but just like civilians , animals can easily become victims			1
for animals , there are no @entity83 and no peace treaties - just our mercy			0
' our troops deserve the best protection , and animals deserve to be left out of human conflict			0
' @entity15 , which manages the range under a long - term partnering agreement , won the top environmental prize at the @entity11 ’s annual @entity93 for its dolphin detection technology			1
competition judge @entity95 said : ‘ this project demonstrated an innovative approach to an emerging issue within marine conservation			0
‘ it shows how defence requirements can be successfully integrated with environmental responsibility			0
’ the award citation said : ' this is an excellent example of how the proactive management of noise can enable the @entity11 to continue its business and conduct live explosive trials			1
' aerial view : the @entity110 range covers 2,500 sq miles of @entity13 , home to hundreds of bottlenose dolphins			1
other marine mammals in the area include porpoises and grey seals a @entity15 spokesman told @entity67 : ‘ the @entity110 range has a rich and diverse history of innovation and problem solving			2
' animals do not wage war , so why should they suffer because humans do ? ' @entity66 spokesman ‘ the development of the @entity32 system is an excellent example of this creativity and technical expertise being used to protect the natural resources in and around @entity13			2
’ the @entity110 range covers 2,500 sq miles of @entity13 , home to hundreds of bottlenose dolphins			1
other marine mammals in the area include porpoises and grey seals			2
separately , in may , the @entity134 was blamed for driving dozens of dolphins to an agonising death during anti-submarine war games			0
a four - year investigation by scientists ruled out every other cause for the @entity60 ’s largest stranding of common dolphins in shallows off the coast of @entity145 in 2008			0
marine conservation : the system has been in use for two years at the @entity11 testing area , which is a conservation area and has the largest population of protected bottlenose dolphins in @entity57 the area was hosting a week of ‘ live fire ’ war games involving 20 @entity134 ships , helicopters and submarines - including the nuclear - powered sub @entity159 - as well as 11 foreign vessels			1
and scientists believed trials of anti-submarine warfare techniques , using a range of mid-frequency sonar devices in the water to detect hidden vessels , were the most likely cause of the deaths			0
but the @entity134 rejected the investigation ’s findings			0
in august , two studies were released in @entity174 suggesting @entity176 training and testing could inadvertently kill hundreds of whales and dolphins and injure thousands over the next five years			2
most of the deaths would come from explosives , though some might come from testing sonar or animals being hit by ships			0
according to the reports , computer models show it may kill 186 whales and dolphins off the @entity192 and 155 off @entity193 and @entity194 .			0

conservationists feared bottlenose dolphins were at risk from missiles
they live in @entity11 testing area at @entity12 in @entity13
but @entity15 experts created a special listening system to find the dolphins
*researchers* can now hear distinctive clicking sounds from 20 miles away
