a double century from @entity1 helped @entity2 finish day two of the second test against @entity4 in the ascendancy			1
fresh from becoming only the fifth batsman - and first @entity8 - to pass 12,000 @entity3 runs on saturday 's opening day , @entity1 made the @entity4 bowlers toil in sunday 's action at the @entity12 in @entity13			0
the stylish number three scored his 11th test double century to help the tourists to a first - innings total of 356 all out to lead by 135 runs - an impressive feat considering they started the day in the perilous position of 78 for five			1
@entity1 celebrates after being dismissed for 203 , the 11th double century of his career @entity1 's innings , guiding the tail from the number three spot , put the tourists in the driving side @entity4 reached the close on 22 without loss in response to trail the tourists by 113 runs			1
the @entity4 bowlers sought to snare the five remaining wickets when play resumed on sunday morning but @entity1 and @entity35 had other ideas and set about getting @entity2 as close to @entity4 's first - innings effort of 221 as possible			2
seamers @entity38 , @entity40 and then @entity41 - so impressive on the opening day - had little joy as @entity1 and @entity35 played flawlessly to steer @entity2 to 159 at lunch , with @entity1 registering his half - century in the process			2
@entity46 congratulates @entity1 after his magnificent effort , which took @entity2 into the lead @entity35 hit an important 67 as he and @entity1 frustrated the bowlers on day two @entity4 had only an opportunistic lbw shout from off - spinner @entity51 to show for their morning efforts and it did not get any better for the hosts after the interval as @entity35 joined his batting partner in notching a fifty			2
@entity35 then passed 1,000 @entity3 runs before his and @entity1 's sixth - wicket partnership ended on 130 runs when @entity59 tempted him to drive at a full , swinging delivery and he succeeded only in edging behind			0
@entity1 cut @entity51 to bring up his 38th test century moments later and useful stands with @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 saw @entity2 pass the @entity4 total and then build a decent lead			0
@entity38 , who had so much success on day one , endured a difficult day with @entity1 in form @entity1 blazed a peach of a cover drive off @entity59 after tea to bring up his 11th test double century - he needs one more to equal sir @entity75 's world record of 12 - before falling on 203 to a stunning @entity77 catch at backward point to give @entity59 his third wicket of the innings			1
throwing caution to the wind , @entity81 danced down the wicket to slog the very next delivery , from @entity51 , but got it horribly wrong and was stumped by @entity86 , who ended the innings with five victims			0
@entity4 openers @entity89 and @entity90 saw out the remaining 11 overs without incident .			0

@entity1 scores 203 , bats @entity2 into strong position
