by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 31 january 2013 the uniquely human phenomenon of crying when we are overcome by emotion developed as a means to communicate our feelings before the emergence of language , an influential scientist claims			1
@entity9 , a professor of neurology , suggests that there must have been a time in our evolution when tears took on a meaning beyond their simple bio-mechanical function - keeping the eyeballs moist			1
he has written a new book - why humans like to cry - that attempts to shed light on the mystery of why our species is the only one in the animal kingdom to shed tears of anguish			1
why do we cry ? shedding tears in response to emotion seems to be a uniquely human phenomenon			1
a @entity31 professor 's new book claims that it emerged as a way to communicate before oral language the work , according to its publisher , offers a wide - ranging discussion of emotional crying , looking at its physiology as well as its evolutionary past			1
biologically , tears are needed to keep the eyeball moist and they contain proteins and other substances to keep it healthy and fight infections			0
in every other animal that seems to be extent of their function , but in humans , crying takes on a whole new , additional significance			2
we can shed tears of joy and tears of anger and for a whole range of other emotions			1
but , most commonly , we shed tears of sadness			1
anguish : professor @entity9 that the emergence of emotional crying is connected with the dawning of self - consciousness professor @entity9 , of @entity31 's @entity68 , said it was this uniquely communicative nature of human crying that led him to investigate the phenomenon			2
' humans cry for many reasons , ' he told @entity74			1
' but crying for emotional reasons and crying in response to aesthetic experiences are unique to us			0
' the former is most associated with loss and bereavement , and the art forms that are most associated with tears are music , literature and poetry			0
' there are very few people who cry looking at paintings , sculptures or lovely buildings			0
but we also have tears of joy the associated feelings of which last a shorter time than crying in the other circumstances			0
' professor @entity9 said he hopes his work will release many , especially men , from the reluctance they feel to be seen shedding tears			2
they are a natural repsonse to not only suffering , but also to feeling compassion for others , he said			0
he added : ' we should not be afraid of our emotions , especially those related to compassion , since our ability to feel empathy and with that to cry tears , is the foundation of a morality and culture which is exclusively human			1
' assessing the phenomenon from the perspective of neuroscience , professor @entity9 suggests that the crying in this way must have emerged in humans at a specific evolutionary turning point			2
he believes that the emergence of emotional crying is connected with the dawning of self - consciousness and the development of a theory of mind - when early humans first realised their peers were also self - conscious beings			0
this , he claims , led to the realisation that the self and others can suffer , feel sadness - and disappear			0
' attachment emotionally to others , with the development of sophisticated facial gestures associated with suffering , and with loss and bereavement ensued , ' he said			0

@entity31 professor attempts to shed light on the mystery of why humans cry
tears were used to communicate as well as their bio-mechanical function
other animals shed tears , but none appear to cry because of emotion
