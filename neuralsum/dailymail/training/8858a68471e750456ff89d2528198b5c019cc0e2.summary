anticipation was high for the meeting of first versus second , although each side dropped a place ahead of kick - off after @entity66 rose to the summit with a 5 - 0 win over @entity69 in the early game			1
goals were not forthcoming in an entertaining opening period , with the best effort coming when @entity74 rattled the crossbar			0
a game that had promised so much petered out during a drab second half to ensure @entity2 ended the day second , a place ahead of their opponents on goal difference			1
the teams looked evenly matched during a calm opening period , with both probing cautiously			0
it was @entity0 who created the first opening when @entity31 cleverly jinked his way past two defenders , only to see a tame left - footed effort saved by @entity41			1
@entity2 responded impressively , with @entity46 forcing @entity24 to save a clever bicycle kick			0
more than 20,000 fans turned out to watch @entity0 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity5 rivals @entity2 the game was suddenly taking on an end - to - end nature , illustrated by @entity74 ’s fizzing 25 - yarder striking the woodwork			1
@entity31 continued to look the biggest threat and , having been afforded too much space once more , drove to the edge of the box before seeing a low effort turned around the post by @entity41			0
@entity0 endured a couple of scares thereafter , @entity24 producing a stunning fingertip save to turn over @entity46 ’s effort before @entity45 ’ effort deflected narrowly over the crossbar			1
@entity2 ended the half in the ascendancy and almost went in ahead , @entity48 ’s stunning volley flying inches over the bar			2
the break appeared to sap the energy from the encounter as both sides struggled for fluency early in the second half			2
but @entity2 still spurned a golden opportunity when @entity52 volleyed over on the stretch after the ball had deflected into his path			0
that was one of the few sparks , however , as the game settled into a grim rhythm			2
the visitors were looking the likelier team to end the stalemate , with @entity50 ’s fizzing ball across the six - yard box just evading @entity52			2
unsurprisingly , @entity0 pressed on the accelerator as the half wore on - although @entity2 ’s back four were proving a tough nut to crack			1
they did not really threaten to penetrate it , either , with a reach effort from distance that flew over their only real strike at goal in the closing stages .			2
