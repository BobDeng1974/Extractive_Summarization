a man accused of murdering a string of women and dumping their bodies may have killed up to 180 people - escaping detection because the police force turned a blind eye to his crimes because his victims were mainly drug addicts and prostitutes , a documentary claims			1
@entity12 - dubbed the @entity12 because he allegedly had a break between committing multiple murders - is due to go on trial later this year accused of sexually assaulting , murdering and then dumping the bodies of 10 women across @entity18 over two decades			1
but a new documentary by @entity21 filmmaker @entity20 suggests @entity22 was able to go on killing for so long , and possibly target dozens more victims , because of a police ' blindness ' to his victims - which he likes to a ' genocide happening and nobody was talking about it			1
' mr @entity20 claims had the police properly investigated the murders and disappearances of mostly black , female prostitutes and drug addicts lives could have been saved			1
he said : ' people did n't know someone was hunting for them			0
bodies of the women were found dumped in alleyways wrapped in carpets or stuffed into rubbish bins			0
however a police search of his home found pictures and videos of 180 women who could all be possible victims			1
it is feared some may have been dumped in landfill because of @entity22 's job as a bin man			2
mr @entity20 said during the time when the crimes were committed , little attention was paid to the disappearance of around 200 women by the police or the media			0
' i thought it was just incredible in the middle of @entity18 which is one of the wealthiest cities in the world , within 15 minutes of the @entity76 sign over 200 women had disappeared in a 25 year period , ' he said			2
he told the @entity78 : ' it was almost like a genocide happening and nobody was talking about it			0
' in his documentary tales of the @entity12 , mr @entity20 claimed police did n't warn people there was a killer lurking in the neighbourhood or do anything to alert people living in nearby @entity76 because the victims were often seen as more of a ' nuisance			1
' he said @entity22 , a father - of - two , was able to go on killing so long because he targeted vulnerable black women , many of whom had become crack and cocaine addicts in the 1980s			1
the suspected victims of the @entity12 : @entity101 ( left ) survived an attempted murder and was found in 1988 , @entity99 ( centre ) was found dead in an alley in september 1988 , @entity104 ( right ) died in august 1986 in an alleyway @entity109 ( left ) was found dead in 2003 , @entity106 ( centre ) in january 1988 and @entity108 ( right ) was found dead and dumped in an alleyway in april 1987 @entity111 ( left ) was found in november 1987 - just a few months before @entity112 ( right ) was found princess @entity113 ( left ) was discovered in an alley in march 2002 , and @entity115 ( right ) in 1995 mr @entity20 added : ' they were just seen as disposable people			1
' the police had this term , @entity120 , which meant no human involved , which they used to call in murders of prostitutes by gang members			0
they did n’t take it seriously , they did n’t seek evidence			0
they would often not even use the proper name of the prostitute , just call it in as a “ @entity133			0
” ' they just did n't take it seriously			0
most of the women were prostitutes and drug addicts and i do n't think it helped that the people were black			1
' mr @entity20 said it could not have been an ' accident ' that 200 people disappeared or were murdered in the same small area in a 25 year period			0
he said had the murders been taking place in somewhere like the wealthy district of @entity150 then the area would have been closed down , police presence increased and press coverage of the incident			0
a search of @entity156 's mint green @entity18 home found up to 180 pictures of women , many of whom are missing giving one comparison , he said the disappearance of dozens of women was treated very differently from a case in 1988 where a gang had shot students in @entity166 - causing the whole city to be shut down			1
the documentary maker said he thinks some of the murders could have been avoided had police taken the disappearances and killings more seriously			0
he added : ' i definitely think women 's lives could have been saved			0
' if police had told the public in 1987 when they knew there was a serial killer who had already killed five victims , if they had told the community then i think things could have been very different and a lot of lives saved			2
@entity22 was arrested in 2010 after dna evidence was found which appeared to connect the victims stills from the documentary show @entity22 after he was arrested in july 2010 for the 10 murders mr @entity20 , pictured right interviewing a friend of @entity22 's , said the documentary took a year and a half @entity193 was interviewed by @entity20 , giving an insight into life in @entity18 ' people did n't know someone was hunting for them			1
' mr @entity20 said had people been aware there was a danger they would have been more cautious about accepting lifts from people , because some of the victims were not prostitutes or drug addicts but simply those who were waiting for buses late at night			1
mr @entity20 , who spoke to relatives and friends of @entity22 to produce the documentary , claims when his son @entity211 told him officers were almost ' grateful ' that the alleged @entity12 had rid the streets of some of the ' problem ' people they had been dealing with on an almost daily basis			1
he added that in the one - and - a - half years it took to make the documentary , @entity22 was described as a ' loving father ' and almost a @entity222 figure , who would fix people 's cars and get cheap washing machines if they needed them			1
earlier this month a mother - of - two , known only by the name ' @entity228 ' , revealed she may have been one of @entity22 's intended victims as it emerged that her photo was one of the collection found in his home			2
@entity20 ( left ) claims in the documentary that alleged killer @entity22 ( right ) continued with his killing spree for so long because police turned a blind eye to his victims , who were largely black drug addicts ' @entity228 ' claimed she had been forced to pose for a naked picture for @entity22 , her then next door neighbour , after the pair went for a drive in his van in 2006			1
she claimed that @entity22 had showed her other pictures of women , some of which were in strange poses who she thought could have been dead , and then asked her to pose naked			2
she claims she agreed to the picture after she noticed a gun and knife in his van			0
the photo appeared in a collection of images found by the police when @entity22 was arrested in 2010			2
@entity228 told @entity259 she believed she could have been killed by @entity22 , now 62			2
the alleged killer earned the nickname the @entity12 after he allegedly committed murders between 1985 and 1988 , taking a 13 year break before he is believed to have resumed in crime spree in 2002			0
@entity228 said she was stunned when she saw her photo on a documentary about her former neighbor @entity22 , dubbed the @entity12 , is to go on trial for 10 murders and one attempted murder in june police arrested @entity22 in july 2010 after his dna was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes			1
they had linked the crimes , but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of @entity22 's family members			0
police were able to get samples by using an officer to pose as a busboy at a pizza restaurant , and extract dna from dishes and cutlery used by @entity22			2
+ he will go on trial in june , accused of 10 murders and one attempted murder			0
mr @entity20 said @entity22 had been popular in the area , according to locals			0
but they claimed he was often obsessed with crack addicts - becoming popular with women in the 1980s during the crack epidemic which swept @entity18			1
tales of the @entity12 will air in the @entity21 on @entity297 on monday 30 at 9pm , and will be shown in the @entity298 after that date on @entity300 .			0
