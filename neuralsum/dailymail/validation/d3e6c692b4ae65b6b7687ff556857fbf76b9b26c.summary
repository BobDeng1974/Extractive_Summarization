@entity1 's miserable time at @entity2 plumbed new depths when he turned out for the club 's @entity4 in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity7			1
at a virtually empty @entity9 the £ 280,00 - a - week misfit endured a lifeless 72 minutes before suffering the ignominy of hearing cheers when his number was held up			1
@entity2 handed @entity14 a £ 6m loan fee for @entity1 , 29 , and have an option to buy him for £ 43.2m at the end of the season			1
catch up on all the action with @entity21 's @entity20			0
host commentator it could have been a win for @entity2 on tuesday night , had @entity1 not found his way in front of two goalbound shots			1
the expensive loanee did more harm than good to @entity2 's attack			1
one big positive for the home side though was @entity32			2
his all - round performance and excellent goal will surely give @entity35 food for thought with regards to the left back slot			0
anyway , that 's it from our live coverage			0
check out @entity44 's match report here			0
thanks for following ! that 's it , the referee has blown the final whistle and @entity2 and @entity7 play out a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity50 scored the opener for @entity7 before @entity32 equalised with a brilliant chip in the second half			1
but despite an attack boasting @entity1 and @entity55 , @entity2 could n't find a winner and @entity7 had the best chance of the second half when they hit the bar			1
@entity59 heads @entity61 's first corner wide via a deflection - a second comes in but it only ends with captain @entity64 fouling the goalkeeper			2
there will be three minutes of time added on			0
@entity69 's brilliant back - heel sets up @entity61 for a cross			1
his pin - point ball comes to the feet of @entity73 but he hesitates in a way that resembled the man he replaced , @entity1			2
when he finally got the shot off , the effort was blocked and the chance was gone			0
still both teams going in search of a winner			0
meanwhile , @entity7 make a sub			2
@entity84 is off for @entity85			0
@entity86 is on as @entity2 search for a winner			2
off comes @entity89 to be replaced by @entity90			0
@entity2 arguably look better with @entity1 off the pitch and @entity55 trusted with a more central role			1
@entity32 's cross from the right just evades the young striker sliding on and shortly after @entity61 puts another @entity32 delivery over the bar			2
@entity1 is being subbed off ! he 's been poor in truth and has done more harm than good to @entity2 's attacks			1
@entity35 is unlikely to be impressed and you would think he has no chance of starting at the weekend on this showing			0
he is replaced by @entity73			0
oh , and he awkwardly did n't seem to realise it was him that was being hooked at first , just as he did with the first team against @entity107			0
it 's fair to say the @entity9 crowd were n't too impressed with him either : @entity111 comes out to scoop up the ball under the feet @entity89 but the @entity7 make takes exception to his efforts and they have a bit of a shove at each other			1
nothing special too and they 're both just warned by the referee			0
@entity121 comes off and surprise january signing on loan from @entity124 , @entity69 , joins the action			0
brilliant work from @entity32 down the right flank for @entity2 and he finds himself in acres of space and with loads of time to pick a pass to the onrushing @entity133 at the edge of the area			1
he hits a low shot and it lands at the feet of @entity1 but he can only find a slight deflection and it 's easily saved			2
again , it looked originally goalbound			0
@entity50 again provides from the left , this time his cross goes all the way to the edge of the area and @entity145 , who pokes a shot towards goal but it 's easily saved by @entity111			1
a free - kick routine ends with @entity50 playing a short cross to @entity150 at the near post and his glanced header hits the bar with @entity111 nowhere near it			1
best chance of the half so far goes to @entity7			2
not too much happening here but @entity32 is again looking the star of the show for @entity2			1
do n't think we 've seen @entity1 touch the ball yet in the second period since he kicked us off			2
meanwhile , @entity163 has just put @entity164 ahead against @entity165 at the @entity166 in the @entity167			0
it 's 1 - 0 but that leaves @entity165 still 2 - 1 ahead of aggregate			2
keep up to date with our coverage here			0
the @entity7 forward makes a darting run forward through midfield with a couple of feints thrown in for good measure , but he 's eventually tackled on the edge of the @entity179 into the second half at @entity9			1
@entity1 kicks the second period off from the centre spot			2
that 's it for the first half			0
@entity32 equalised for @entity2 with an excellent chip after @entity50 opened the scoring for @entity7			1
it 's not been great from star man @entity1 so far but he 's putting himself about and you feel a better chance will come if he 's not hooked at the break			2
coming up to half him and @entity61 is the latest @entity2 player to have a pop from range			0
this time it 's from 25 yards and it goes a few inches over @entity197 's head			0
he had the keeper worried			0
one minute of added time is shown at @entity9			0
a poor - and unnecessary - challenge sees the @entity2 youngster booked			2
@entity32 is showing himself as the best player on the pitch here and it 's seems a little bizarre that his first - team prospects are in doubt under @entity208 when you consider @entity211 's recent form			1
. spurs are producing some good passing play and at times @entity1 is reduced to feeding off scraps in the air up against young defenders			0
surely he could n't have envisaged that when he arrived back in august			0
meanwhile , @entity21 's @entity44 reports that the steadily growing crowd at @entity9 are finding their voices after the goal			2
just when @entity7 looked to be getting on top goalkeeper @entity220 drops a bit of a clanger			0
he collects the ball from a cross ahead of @entity1 and looks to bowl it out to a team - mate			1
instead it hits @entity32 and the @entity229 has all the time in the world to send a sumptuous chip back over the goalkeeper 's head and into the net			1
left - footed , and from 35 yards			0
awful pass out of the area from @entity237 for @entity2 and @entity89 latches on to a ball back in			0
a brilliant bit of skill gets him away from his marker but a cheeky chipped finish past @entity111 drops just wide			2
shades of @entity2 's defeat on monday night here ...			1
shocking back pass from @entity248 and it arrives at the feet of @entity7 ' @entity50			1
he advances forward past one challenger and slots in an excellent finish past @entity111			0
ah , that 's not so good from the on - loan forward			0
@entity55 makes an excellent run cutting in from the right wing and fires in a thunderous left - footed shot			2
it looks to be going on target but instead the smashes into the back of @entity1 and out of play			0
@entity266 , a star of @entity7 ' @entity267 semi-final first leg win over @entity269 last week , has a chance to put his side ahead after being played in over the top			0
unfortunately for the visitors he blasts over from a tight angle			0
another chance for @entity1 , this time he teams up with @entity32 again and is one - on - one with marker @entity277 but he ca n't break past him and the tackle dispossess him			1
@entity133 follows up and fires narrowly wide from 20 yards			0
the stands are filling up at @entity9 a little more during the opening stages - it 's not every night you get a £ 40million - rated star striker playing in a free - entry game			1
@entity288 's free - kick for @entity7 the only real dangerous opportunity so far			1
@entity32 is another @entity2 first - team player hoping to impress tonight and he bursts into the box down the right but a deep cross can not be controlled by @entity1 and @entity7 clear			1
the @entity293 has been flagged offside once and at least seems willing to get himself about - this could be a positive evening for him			0
meanwhile a brilliant run from @entity288 for @entity7 draws a foul and @entity7 have a free - kick in a dangerous area , but it 's sent well over the bar into an empty @entity301			1
@entity2 's expensive loanee has his first opportunity of the game , receiving the ball in off the right flank and trying to turn a marker inside the area			2
the ball gets tangled under his feet though and the chance is gone			0
not the greatest start , but a start nonetheless			0
the two teams are out , with @entity1 at the back of the @entity2 line - up and we 've kicked off			1
@entity35 's assistant manager @entity316 is in attendance at @entity9 tonight and is sitting alongside his former team - mate @entity318			1
if @entity1 wants a place in the side to face @entity7 's first team this weekend then he 'll have to show something to impress @entity316			1
the two teams tonight sit joint top of the @entity325 ( although @entity7 have a game in hand ) , so tonight 's result will decide who becomes the outright leader			2
it might be @entity2 's only chance of silverware this season after their @entity336 exit on monday night , which you can read @entity339 's match report for @entity340			1
@entity2 are expected to play a 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 diamond , with @entity1 and @entity55 leading the line , a pairing that has faced @entity344 and @entity345 in the @entity336 this season			1
and if you 're wondering how @entity2 can field @entity1 in this competition , here 's a bit of context for you : here 's tonight 's team sheet from @entity9 , courtesy of @entity21 's @entity44			1
a couple of names that stand out compared to your regular @entity325 game , with @entity1 , @entity111 and @entity32 all starting alongside @entity55 and the other players under the age of 21 .			1

@entity1 started for @entity2 under 21s at @entity9
first - team players @entity32 , @entity55 and @entity111 all feature too
@entity1 was an *unused* substitute in monday 's first - team defeat by @entity366
@entity248 's error set up @entity7 ' @entity50 for the opener
@entity32 equalised with a brilliant chip following up on a keeping error
