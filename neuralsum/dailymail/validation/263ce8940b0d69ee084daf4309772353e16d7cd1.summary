getting through senior school has never been easy , but with the invention of smart phones and social media , running the teenage gauntlet has become twice as hard			1
a new documentary series called @entity6 , which airs its first episode tonight on @entity8 , follows a group of teenagers from @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 for a year and charts how modern technology has changed the way young people interact			1
the cameras started to follow the group in january 2014 and continued to record their antics until the end of december			1
what becomes clear early on in the programme is how much each teen uses their phone – whether it is to engage on social media or simply text their parents			1
this first episode meets @entity45 and @entity46 , who have both have just joined school for sixth form			1
@entity46 , 16 , uses his @entity51 account for three main functions – stirring up emotions among his friends , pranking his mates and family members to appear cool among his peers , and lastly , to meet young women			2
he finds a girl on twitter who looks attractive then follows her and sends her a couple of public messages , before long they are sending each other private messages			2
@entity46 and @entity45 feature heavily in the show and come to blows over @entity51 he tells the cameras : ‘ when you ’re on @entity72 ’s you ’re on good ground , then she gives you her number			2
‘ when she gives you her number , that ’s it - you ‘ re so close to succeeding			0
‘ that ’s when you [ use the number to ] go on @entity30			1
‘ you do n’t text because that ’s too serious , who do you text now ? your mum and dad			0
’ @entity45 , who is also 16 , uses @entity51 to get involved in campaigns like @entity83			0
this episode shows how social media can be a force for good among teens , by engaging them in current issues and broadening their horizons			1
but it also shows that having teens so closely linked 24/7 also allows tensions to become inflamed and how easy it is for bullying to start			2
in the show , @entity45 is seen inviting a campaigner from @entity97 to come and give a talk at the school about the issue			0
@entity101 and @entity102 , who feature on a later episode of the documentary series during the debate , many of the pupils side with @entity108 , believing that a woman with her breasts out does no harm			2
when @entity46 says that it is simply tradition , the @entity113 campaigner says that is not a good reason to keep something and likens it to slavery , which she also calls a tradition			0
the comment has an inflammatory effect on the pupils present , who quickly take to social media sites like @entity51 to attack the lecture , with many blaming @entity45 because she organised it			1
later that evening , the pupils continue to whip up a storm on social media and @entity45 reads multiple comments about herself being an attention seeker and that someone has called her fat which is retweeted several times			1
she cries in front of the cameras and says that the comments have really affected her self - esteem			0
the producers then talk to a group of girls from the school who have also been attacked on social media			1
one says : ‘ it ’s hard on twitter because you do n’t have to tag someone ’s name on it , so you can twist it and say it was n’t about them , even when it clearly is			0
another adds : ‘ someone wrote “ these are the ugliest girls in the year ” on @entity51 and listed lots of my friends ’ names underneath , i was on there as well			2
’ @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 all take part in a later episode of the programme but while @entity45 labels the @entity51 drama ‘ @entity165 ’ during the evening when the abuse is at its worse , the next day everyone is back at school and smiling and joking			0
it becomes clear that although the teenagers are able to be highly aggressive to each other when behind their computers , they have also become very adept at recovering from the situation the next day			0
@entity46 says : ‘ when you say something to someone on social media , you are n’t aware of the consequences			1
‘ they ca n’t come and find you and that ’s why people find it quite good			0
‘ @entity51 beef is probably the most entertaining thing in society			0
‘ i stick to the thing where i ’d say to someone on social media what i would say to them in real life			1
’ but possibly the biggest change is how nothing , not even the amount of sleep you had the night before , is private any more			0
the schoolmates tweet about everything from a failed biology test , two six hours sleep and how they were let down by a girl			0
just fifteen years ago , a teenager could leave @entity199 as a preppie schoolboy and come back three months later as a goth in the sixth form			2
these days that kid would be papped heading down to the corner shop for a pint of milk mid-transformation and it would be on the web for their peers to see within minutes			0
social media and unlimited internet on smart phones has given these teens the freedom to interact with their friends all night , but they 've paid a hefty price - real expression			1
teens airs tonight , tuesday 24 march , on @entity8			1
