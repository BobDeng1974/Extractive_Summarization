by @entity1 reporter it 's puppy love for the record books			2
the labrador retriever was the nation 's most popular dog breed last year for a 23rd year in a row , the @entity4 has announced			1
that 's the longest any breed has been top dog since the organization 's 1884 founding			1
@entity15 shepherds , golden retrievers , beagles and bulldogs are holding steady in the top - five pack , with @entity21 terriers , boxers , poodles , rottweilers and dachshunds continuing to round out the leading 10 , which mirrors last year			1
surpassing the poodle 's 22 - year reign some decades ago , the @entity5 has proliferated as a congenial , highly trainable dog that was developed to fetch game but has readily taken on other roles : search - and - rescue aid , therapy dog , competitor in canine sports and all - around family pet			1
' they 're a very versatile dog			2
they 'll adapt to just about anything , ' says @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60 , who has bred them for 45 years			0
the rankings reflect newly registered dogs , mostly puppies			0
the @entity4 does n't release exact numbers but estimates its registry has included more than 40 million purebred dogs over its history			1
runner up : @entity15 shepherds have come in second on the @entity4 's @entity70 in the @entity30 list helpful : the working ability that has made @entity73 such useful hunting companions also make them ideal guide , assistance and search and rescue dogs adorable : the @entity73 , with its intelligence and eager to please attitude , is the third most popular breed in the @entity30 adorable : it 's easy to understand why so many pet owners gravitate to the adorable golden pups 1			1
@entity94 the top 10 remains a testament to the variety of purebreds , from the pert , portable yorkie to the muscular , purposeful rottweiler			2
but overall , the @entity4 has logged some leaning toward larger dogs in the past decade			1
@entity102 and @entity103 have dropped out of the top 10 , while @entity105 and bulldogs have marched in			2
such big breeds as the doberman pinscher , the @entity109 and even the great @entity110 have made double - digit gains on the popularity ladder			0
feisty : bulldogs , known for their loose - jointed , shuffling gait and massive , short - faced head , came in at number five on the prestigious list cute canines : @entity120 , or ' frenchies ' , came in at 14th last year - up from 58th in 2002 but no breed has rocketed up the rankings quite like the @entity40 bulldog , now the nation 's 11th most popular purebred after its numbers more than quadrupled in the last 10 years			2
the @entity120 was 14th last year - and 58th in 2002			0
with foreshortened faces , large pointed ears and an attitude that 's been described as ' a clown in the cloak of a philosopher ' , @entity40 bulldogs were in vogue in the @entity30 around the turn of the 20th century			0
then their popularity waned until recent years , when they 've gotten exposure in such venues as @entity143 's chic - domesticity empire , tv 's ' @entity144 ' and a 2012 @entity147 commercial			0
some people flock to frenchies because they 're compact and do n't need a lot of exercise or elaborate coat care			0
after 15 years of breeding cocker spaniels , @entity153 developed tendinitis in her elbow and had difficulty brushing them , so she decided to try the short - coated @entity120			0
the bunch : the @entity4 said big breeds such as @entity5 , @entity15 and @entity161 are becoming increasingly popular as the economy improves snapping at their heels : after a decade - long popularity spurt , the @entity40 bulldog is working its way up the popular breed iist ' they have so many funny and endearing qualities , ' including being people - oriented , said @entity172 , of @entity173 , @entity168 ' a @entity120 is everyone 's friend			1
' still , popularity causes some consternation for aficionados , who fear demand can drive irresponsible breeding			0
to be sure , dog breeding in general has critics who feel it 's more focused on human tastes than canine health and draws dog lovers away from mixed - breed pets that need homes			1
purebred fans counter that conscientious breeding aims to create healthy dogs with somewhat predictable traits , helping people and dogs make lasting pairings			0
popular : the most famous @entity195 of all is @entity196 from the classic comic strip ' peanuts ' number four : the @entity195 , a sturdy hunting dog , is one of the most popular dogs in the @entity30			1

it 's the longest any breed has been top dog since @entity4 's 1884 founding
