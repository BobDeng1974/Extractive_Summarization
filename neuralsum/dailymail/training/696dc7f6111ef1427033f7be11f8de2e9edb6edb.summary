by @entity0 published : 15:33 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 17:13 est , 10 january 2013 prosecutors in the murder trial of @entity3 have displayed a grisly photograph they say was accidentally taken as she dragged her ex-lover 's body through his home after stabbing him 27 times			1
the dark image apparently depicts the back of @entity3 's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck			1
a large dark obstruction in the foreground of the picture is a leg in sweatpants , the jury in @entity18 heard			0
the prosecution alleges the picture was taken as @entity25 , who they say flew into a rage after learning her ex-boyfriend wanted to date someone else , dragged @entity32 's body through his @entity33 , @entity34 home			1
the image was apparently snapped as a camera was dropped			0
a leg in the foreground obstructs most of the image they claim @entity25 repeatedly stabbed @entity32 in his shower before dragging him to his bedroom and slicing his throat			1
she then allegedly took him back to the bathroom to shoot him in the head			0
two friends found his body in the shower on june 9 , 2008 , five days after he was killed			2
