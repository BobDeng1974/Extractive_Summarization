’ experts said the assault on @entity4 could have begun with a single @entity4 employee ’s computer being infiltrated through well - publicised weaknesses in the @entity78 computer language			2

targeted : in recent days , newspapers the @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity22 say they have been targets of sophisticated ' cyber-attacks ' although @entity4 is generally used to publish messages for all the world to see , hacking could enable @entity2 agents to discover the true identity of people posting under pseudonyms , or locate where they are posting from			1

@entity45 and @entity19 intelligence agencies are anxiously hiring their own computer experts in a bid to build up defences , and devise potential counter-attacks , against ruthless foreign hackers			1
