whistleblower @entity0 has added insult to injury for @entity4 after his website @entity6 put hundreds of thousands of emails and documents from last year 's cyberattack into a searchable online archive			1
the calculated move by @entity12 to expose thousands of indiscreet and personal correspondences will likely spell fresh embarrassment for the embattled company so soon after they hoped the dust had settled on the matter			1
@entity12 and @entity6 issued a statement on thursday saying that the data has a public interest , but the majority of the correspondences run from the mundane to the deeply personal			1
they expose not just the unguarded opinions of @entity4 executives , but also reveal health concerns about their children and sadness over dying parents			2
wikileaks claim they built a database from the 170,000 emails and 30,000 other documents stolen from @entity4 by a group calling itself @entity57			1
the group hacked @entity4 in retaliation for the @entity61 assassination film , @entity60 , starring @entity62			2
@entity12 's decision to put the data up in a searchable form could be seen as particularly cruel coming so soon after @entity4 had finished dealing with the fall - out from the damaging affair			1
a picture says 1000 words : @entity70 stares down @entity71 at the @entity72 on december 10 , 2014 - just days after leaked @entity4 emails between her and @entity74 ( right with @entity75 ) revealed @entity70 to be described as a ' minimally talented spoiled brat ' resignation : the embarrassing revelations exposed by the hack of @entity4 led to ceo @entity71 ( pictured with @entity80 ) leaving the company ' the cyber-attack on @entity4 was a malicious criminal act , and we strongly condemn the indexing of stolen employee and other private and privileged information on @entity6 , ' a @entity4 spokesperson said in a statement to @entity90			1
' the attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm spe and its employees , and now @entity6 regrettably is assisting them in that effort			2
' in a statement , @entity12 said the documents deserve to be easily accessible			2
' this archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation			0
it is newsworthy and at the centre of a geopolitical conflict			0
it belongs in the public domain			1
@entity6 will ensure it stays there			2
' @entity6 also claim that the documents show @entity4 's close ties to the @entity46 and its efforts to collect ' intelligence ' on rival studios - including ironically , @entity113 's new film on @entity115 whistleblower , @entity116			1
' the work publicly known from @entity4 is to produce entertainment , ' @entity6 wrote in their statement issued on thursday			1
' however , the @entity120 show that behind the scenes this is an influential corporation , with ties to the @entity123 , with an ability to impact laws and policies , and with connections to the @entity48 military - industrial complex			0
' the @entity6 site lets users find emails , documents or an entire cache of files through searches using keywords , people who sent or received emails and types of files			1
the site made a name for itself in 2010 when it began publishing diplomatic cables leaked by @entity143 , formerly known as @entity143			0
cause of the woes : the interview , a comedy about two journalists - @entity148 and @entity62 - was widely seen as the reason why @entity4 was attacked by cyber-hackers affiliated with @entity151 @entity12 is currently battling a detention order in @entity153 , where he is wanted by prosecutors in an investigation of alleged sex crimes			1
he has avoided being extradited to @entity153 by taking shelter in the @entity158 in @entity159 since 2012			0
@entity4 blasted @entity6 for creating the archive , saying the website was helping the hackers disseminate stolen information			1
' we vehemently disagree with @entity6 ' assertion that this material belongs in the public domain , ' the company said in a statement			1
the searchable online archive is the latest blow for the entertainment and technology company struggling to get past the attack , which the company estimates caused millions in damage			1
@entity4 ' troubles began last december after it suffered an extensive hacking attack and release of confidential emails ahead of its release of ' @entity60 , ' a comedy that centers around the assassination of @entity151 leader @entity61			2
canceled : following the cyber hack , @entity4 pulled @entity60 from general release and ended up releasing the movie online only @entity187 took credit for the attack and threatened terror attacks if the film was not pulled from theaters			2
the company at first shelved the film , but it subsequently opened in a limited release			0
@entity48 intelligence officials said the group was linked to @entity151 , but no official link has been made			0
the attack exposed tens of thousands of sensitive documents , including studio financial records , employment files and emails between @entity4 executives			1
some emails revealed exchanges between @entity206 - winning producer @entity74 and @entity4 ' co-chair @entity71 that contained a frank assessment of @entity70 's talent and racially offensive jokes about president @entity211 's presumed taste in movies			2
indeed , an email from studio executive @entity214 labeled comedian @entity215 a ' whore ' and producer @entity74 called @entity70 , a ' minimally talented spoiled brat '			0
the scandal led to the resignation of @entity75			0
' the content of my emails to @entity74 were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who i am , ' @entity75 wrote in a public apology			0
' although this was a private communication that was stolen , i accept full responsibility for what i wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended			0
' recent hit : @entity71 with the stars of @entity4 comedy , @entity235 , from left , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity215 at the premiere in @entity240 on january 6 the company announced in february that @entity75 would transition to a job as the head of a new production venture at the studio			2
@entity74 also published an apology , saying : ' i made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny , but in the cold light of day , they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive â€” and not funny at all			0
to anybody i 've offended , i 'm profoundly and deeply sorry , and i regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused			0
' wikileaks claim they have found correspondence which exposes @entity4 's political fundraising and lobbying for anti-piracy			1
they point to emails which detail how members of the studio set up a ' collective ' to get around campaign donation limits and made contributions to @entity269 governor @entity268			0
@entity6 justified their move by pointing to lobbying issues they have found in the leaks			0
' @entity4 is a member of the @entity276 and a strong lobbyist on issues around internet policy , piracy , trade agreements and copyright issues , ' their press release claimed			0
' the emails show the back and forth on lobbying and political efforts , not only with the @entity276 but with politicians directly			0

@entity6 *uploads* hundreds of thousands of emails and documents into a searchable online archive
documents date from last year 's *crippling* cyberattack against @entity4
it 's the latest blow for the company struggling to get past the attack
