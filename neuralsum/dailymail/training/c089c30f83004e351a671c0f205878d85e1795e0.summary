@entity1 was accused of providing lessons without a licence in the alpine resort of @entity13 , where he spent last night in custody			1
it is all part of an escalating ‘ piste war ’ which last month saw a @entity9 teenager claim she was assaulted by police clamping down on foreign instructors			1
ski professionals from the @entity9 believe the @entity6 are trying to drive them off the slopes – ruining peoples ’ holidays in the process			1
mr @entity1 , 40 , who is originally from @entity27 in @entity28 , has worked as an instructor in @entity13 for more than a decade , but is now officially banned from doing so because he lacks a @entity6 qualification			1
he claims he was filming a group of @entity9 skiers on tuesday when he was arrested by four gendarmes accompanied by government officials			1
now he faces up to three months in prison for the offence of instructing without qualifications			0
‘ the police surrounded @entity1 and then escorted him away , ’ said @entity38 , from @entity39 , one of around 100 protesters including parents with children massing at the @entity43 in @entity13			1
‘ we were all deeply shocked to see @entity1 arrested , and decided to join the demonstration outside the police station			1
they should not be allowed to get away with this			0
’ ms @entity38 , who is in @entity13 with a party of six family and friends , is staying in the @entity53 , which is run by @entity55 @entity54			2
mr @entity54 , himself a highly experienced instructor , was arrested last year for illegal instructing and is currently appealing a three - month suspended sentence			0
protest : around 100 holidaymakers gathered today to demonstrate against the @entity62 's arrest ‘ i was led off the slopes in handcuffs – it ’s pure persecution , ’ said mr @entity54 , 50			2
‘ if this kind of thing happened to @entity6 workers in @entity9 there would be an absolute outcry			1
‘ @entity1 is a hugely popular instructor , and that ’s why so many people decided to protest about his arrest			2
our initial aim is to get him freed			0

‘ the gendarme leapt on her , twisting her arm back , ’ said mr @entity83			0
‘ she was screaming and crying with pain			0
’ @entity6 ’s employment market is a notoriously protectionist one , with everything from hard - to - get training qualifications to strict social security rules used to keep foreign workers out			0
this has made it hugely difficult for @entity9 instructors to get jobs in @entity6 , the second biggest ski holiday market in the world			2
the country expects instructors to have passed the ‘ @entity104 ’ – a qualification which requires completing a tough downhill slalom at racing speed			0
in january a decision by a court in @entity110 to ban @entity9 ski hosts – those who simply accompany holidaymakers on the slopes – outraged the @entity9 alpine sports industry			2
