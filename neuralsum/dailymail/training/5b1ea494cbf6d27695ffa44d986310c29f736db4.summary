it was a transfer that added gloss to @entity3 ’s summer business			1
@entity4 , signed initially on loan from @entity6 following a tumultuous deadline day , brought 13 @entity9 caps and one @entity11 winners ’ medal to a club shorn of success in recent years			1
a good move for the player , who wanted to escape the ‘ negativity ’ of @entity18 , as well as both clubs concerned			2
yet that spark has yet to ignite on @entity4 ’s career in @entity22 , and the defeat at @entity24 on monday night was an opportunity missed			1
his statistics from the 2 - 0 loss are actually fairly positive			1
he misplaced just seven of his 65 passes to record a success rate of 89 per cent , higher than any of his team - mates , excluding @entity32 who completed only 18 passes			0
@entity3 's @entity4 ( front ) advances the ball as @entity24 's @entity37 gives chase midfielder @entity4 ( right ) on the ball as @entity40 keeps close during @entity24 's 2 - 0 home win on monday @entity4 falls to the ground as @entity24 's @entity43 ( front ) makes the slide tackle during monday 's match he struck a sweet volley through a mass of bodies that @entity50 did well to keep out late on too			1
but that drive forward to start and finish attacking plays was missing			0
when your star striker is still shaking off the effects of six months spent on the sidelines through a ruptured achilles it shows			0
as @entity4 ’s touch map shows , he was busy but rarely did he get involved at the sharp end			2
only once did he touch the ball in the box , and he tried just three passes into the 18 - yard area			0
when he was unveiled to the press at @entity3 ’s @entity67 training ground , he spoke about hitting both boxes and being the most advanced of a midfield trio			2
manager @entity70 asked @entity4 to play on the left of those on monday night , with @entity74 holding and @entity75 right			1
tactics heavily influence where a player makes an impact of course , but the dynamism desperately needed by @entity3 was lacking			2
@entity4 's pass map against @entity24 on monday is shown on the left , with his touch map on the right those of us who remember the impact @entity4 made in the 2011 @entity89 know he has it within him to affect and create where it matters			1
he played two first - time passes , including the key assist to unlock @entity97 ’s defence for @entity99 ’s equaliser , in a fast - flowing move around the area			0
there was also the 8 - 2 win over @entity104 where he looked a player who had found himself following successful loan spells at @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
the promise never quite materialised but it is worth noting that even while getting pilloried last season he made 35 appearances for club and country			0
the campaign before , sir @entity115 started him against @entity117 in a match ( and tie ) @entity6 were winning until @entity99 got a straight red card			2
the @entity117 midfield that night contained @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
@entity4 keeps close to @entity126 's @entity125 ( left ) during an appearance for @entity6 @entity4 celebrates after scoring for @entity6 against @entity128 in december 2012 that could not have been blind faith from @entity115 , the most successful @entity131 manager in history , in a game he was desperate to win ; this @entity6 academy graduate can play and fulfill instructions			1
against @entity136 he came straight into the @entity3 team and helped carry out @entity70 ’s defensive plans to a tee			2
@entity141 ’ team were pressed tight in central areas and suffocated from inflicting their usual attacking verve			0
that result bears contextualising with @entity136 ’s recent struggles to break down defences , notably @entity147 last weekend			0
nevertheless , @entity4 can do the dirty stuff when asked			0
subsequent losses against @entity104 , @entity150 , @entity97 , and @entity151 saw that initial glow fade , although he has already created eight chances , compared to 10 in the whole of last season			0
that is what @entity3 , a side without a goal in more than eight hours , need from him now : vibrancy in the final third			0
he may never return to @entity6 , but this is his chance , at 25 , to show he can still be a very good @entity11 player			1
@entity4 makes the challenge during @entity9 's @entity163 qualifier against @entity164 in september 2012 @entity4 ( right ) dribbles with the ball as @entity166 gives chase during @entity168 's friendly against @entity169 in 2012			1

midfielder @entity4 is on loan at @entity3 from @entity6
the 25 - year - old has won 13 @entity9 caps and one @entity11 medal
the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity24 on monday was an opportunity missed for @entity4
this is his chance to show he can still be a very good player
