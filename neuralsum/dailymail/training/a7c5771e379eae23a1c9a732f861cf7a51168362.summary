parents who went to watch their children perform in a @entity3 concert were barred for being late to the primary school , which was inspected as part of trojan horse scandal			1
staff at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , refused to let more than 25 people in to watch their children sing , after they turned up late because of heavy traffic			1
among those was a grandmother who had travelled more than 130 miles from @entity15 to see the show , which was put on by children aged between five and 11			1
parents who turned up late to a @entity3 concert at @entity8 in @entity9 were turned away by staff on friday one outraged mother who witnessed the incident last friday said latecomers were being denied entry by head teacher @entity24			1
she said : ' some parents who turned up five minutes late were told they could n't go in			1
' they were told they would interrupt the choir			0
but as i was sat in the performance the bell rang twice			0
' one gran had come up from @entity15			2
it was very sad and some parents were understandably very angry			2
' i 've never known anything like it			0
' some people were coming straight from work and got caught in traffic			0
' it is christmas time and it felt very wrong to do it to the children			0
' but head teacher mr @entity24 , who previously caused outrage at the school after he gave children books on tackling homophobia , has defended the decision			1
he said that the school 's policy is to refuse admittance to audience members arriving more than ten minutes after the start of performances			1
' it was n't done to be vindictive , ' he said			0
' ten minutes is a long time , and if people continue to come in after that time it is disruptive for the children and other parents			2
' i always have to put the interests of the children first and we have had this rule for a long time			0
families had been caught in traffic and were said to be ' angry ' and ' devastated ' at not being allowed in ' in hindsight we could have made it clearer before the performance we will make it clearer for future performances			1
' the concert was put on by most of the school 's 478 pupils , between year 1 and 6 , and started at 2pm last friday			1
parents had been warned in advance that places were limited and it could only allocate two tickets per family			2
the school was among 21 others in @entity9 to be inspected by @entity86 this year in connection with the trojan horse scandal , which saw secular schools being infiltrated by extremists			0
the report found @entity8 , which has a large @entity93 intake , to be ' meeting requirements ' in terms of safeguarding children from extremism			2
in october a meeting at the school between mr @entity24 and parents became heated and police were called , but the head teacher denies being escorted from the premises , following earlier reports			1
between 1997 and 1998 @entity3 festivities in the city were given the name ' @entity107 ' by @entity9 council to reflect the diverse nature of the population			0
at the time the council said it was making the change to create a more welcoming , multi-cultural atmosphere due to the large proportion of ethnic groups			0
however the move was widely criticised and the @entity116 , the @entity118 @entity117 , said it was political correctness gone mad .			0
