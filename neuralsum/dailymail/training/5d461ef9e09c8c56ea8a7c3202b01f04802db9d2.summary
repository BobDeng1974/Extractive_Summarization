@entity3 boss @entity2 wanted to make the loan deal permanent but @entity0 persuaded the @entity22 midfielder that his future lay in @entity1 after he succeeded @entity14 and @entity9 has since signed a new four - year contract at the @entity25			1
@entity5 made a big impact for @entity3 last season - but his future is now at @entity1 @entity0 ( left ) has lauded @entity2 's handling of @entity9 during his loan spell last season ' @entity2 deserves big credit , he gave him a good role in the team and highlighted what @entity9 had , but we knew that anyway , ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity1 's league trip to @entity3 on saturday			1
' i knew that myself after playing with him and seeing him in training and that 's why i made it clear for him to stay			2
' but he 's matured as well as a footballer and a human being			0
he understands himself a bit more now of what he needs to do to get the best out of himself and what players need from him as well			0
' the 25 - year - old has been one of @entity1 's stand - out performers during their impressive start to the season and repaid @entity0 's hard work during the summer when he made getting @entity9 back on board one of his main priorities			2
' i spoke to him a lot in the summer and told him he was the type of player i wanted with us , ' @entity0 said			2

' i explained that very much to him and from that point onwards he was pretty much sold on it			0
' his commitment in training every day has been great and in the games he is producing some good football			0
' @entity75 refuses to criticise his predecessor @entity14 over his decision to send @entity9 out on loan last season , but @entity1 defender @entity60 admits the @entity6 club 's dressing room were baffled by the fact he was playing for one of their relegation rivals at the time			1
