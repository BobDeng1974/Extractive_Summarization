the child safety watchdog failed to expose the sexual exploitation of thousands of children and young people in @entity5 because its inspectors never bothered to look for it , senior officials admitted yesterday			1
inspectors working for the @entity10 regulator were instructed that they should watch out for sex abuse happening inside the children 's homes and foster homes where children in council care were living			1
but their rules said nothing about looking out for the exploitation of children who were collected from houses , institutions and schools by taxi drivers and assaulted and raped away from their homes by determined gangs of abusers			2
not one of the officials and inspectors who missed the country 's biggest child abuse scandal has been sacked from @entity10 , former executives of the organisation told @entity35			1
admission : @entity10 's former chiefs said the child safety watchdog failed to expose the sexual exploitation of thousands of children and young people in @entity5 because its inspectors never looked for it the guidelines that steered @entity10 's inspectors away from the ruthless exploitation of up to 2,000 children and girls by organised @entity47 gangs in the @entity49 town were revealed to mps of the @entity51 by two of its former chiefs			1
@entity55 , the @entity56 mp who chairs the committee , said : ' the public thinks @entity10 ticks boxes			2
it does n't get in to what is really happening in an authority			0
' the regulator 's former deputy chief inspector @entity63 made the admission and apologised for the watchdog 's failures a week after the devastating report on the @entity5 scandal by @entity71 adviser @entity70			0
she found the town 's council obscured and suppressed evidence of large - scale sex exploitation , trafficking and rape over a 16 - year period , partly because councillors and staff feared being accused of racism			2
while the gangs were grooming and violently attacking the town 's children by the hundred , @entity10 repeatedly rated the councils ' social work record as ' adequate ' and published a report which said the way it cared for children was improving			1
mr @entity63 told @entity35 that the ' framework ' within which inspectors examined the council 's work was not designed to deal with child sexual exploitation , which he defined as exploitation outside a home			1
' the framework focussed on child sex abuse , which mainly happens in children 's homes , ' he said			2
' that framework , i would now look back and and say , was very strongly focussed on effective outcomes on abuse and neglect on children in the home			0
why did it not have a focus on child sexual exploitation ? i have reflected on that as you can imagine			1
' the framework was known as @entity118 , or @entity118 for short , mr @entity63 said			0
one mp commented : ' @entity119 may be the appropriate word			0
' mr @entity63 added : ' i think that our understanding of child sexual exploitation - and i 'm not just talking about @entity10 but a national understanding - up to that time was that it was an evil that had surfaced in a small number of very specific places and very specific circumstances			1
accountable : not one of the officials and inspectors who missed the country 's biggest child abuse scandal has been sacked from @entity10 , former executives of the organisation told mps ' we did n't understand the scale and prevalence and scope of child sexual exploitation until 2012			1
i do n't think we understood that it almost certainly affects thousands of children all around the country and it could be happening in any local authority			0
' by the end of 2012 we were inspecting for child sexual exploitation in a very different way			1
we did n't get it right at the time we inspected @entity5			0
' however @entity149 , @entity10 director of children in 2007 and 2008 , told the @entity35 that inspectors did know about child sexual exploitation outside the home			1
' this was n't a new concept , ' he said			0
' of course it was known about			0
' he said @entity10 had referred to child sexual exploitation in @entity5 in a report published as early as 2006			1
mr @entity63 said : ' i do n't think inspection is perfect			0
i do n't think inspection can ever be perfect			0
' he added that he agreed with @entity10 's chief sir @entity164 ' that we did n't get it right with child sexual exploitation in @entity5			1
he apologised for that and i apologise for that			0
' the inspection frameworks at the time did n't have the focus on child sexual exploitation that they would and should have had if we had known and understood then what we know and understand now			2
' it is clear from reading back over the inspection reports that we did n't appreciate the scale of the child sexual exploitation issue in @entity5 and we did n't scrutinise sufficiently the effectiveness with which it was being responded to			2
' mr @entity63 and mr @entity149 both told @entity35 that they had sacked no - one at @entity10 over the failure			2
they said if inspectors were found to have failed in their job , inspection reports could be rewritten and republished			0
but the public would not be told about lapses by inspectors .			0
