‘ according to present estimates , output had grown at a little above its historical average for each of the past four quarters , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ but it was possible that , after the usual cycle of data revisions , output would ultimately prove to have been growing at an even faster rate			0
’ experts believe the economy has finally returned to its pre-recession peak , having crashed by 7.2 per cent under the last @entity56 government during the ‘ @entity57 ’ of 2008 - 09			2
@entity59 chief @entity58 this week revealed the @entity61 giant had suffered its third year in a row of falling profits			1
but the rest of the retail sector appears to be booming household spending has driven the turnaround over the past 12 months , but manufacturing and business investment are also growing			1

food sales were 6.3 per cent higher than a year earlier – the best performance since january 2002 – as supermarkets cut prices in a bid to lure shoppers away from their rivals			0
