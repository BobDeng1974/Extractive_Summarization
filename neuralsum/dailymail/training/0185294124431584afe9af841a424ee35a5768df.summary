a couple who recently moved into a rented home discovered a cache of 7,500 bullets in a pond in their back garden			1
@entity7 , 33 , who lives with his girlfriend @entity8 , 32 , made the shocking discovery while he was clearing weeds from the water feature			1
he said he saw a flash of metal and thought it was a piece of gold , but upon closer inspection he found that it was actually a bullet			0
police officers arrived at the house where they discovered 2.2mm rifle rounds , up to 30 machine gun rounds , shotgun cartridges , and a cache of 9mm and 8mm rounds			1
hands - on : a police officer wearing purple gloves lines up a number of the bullets found in the pond at @entity32 and ms @entity8 's home safe : despite the thousands of bullets that were found , the police did not feel the need to evacuate the couple now the pair are worried there may be more rounds of undiscovered ammunition in their home			1
mr @entity7 said : ' it ’s really unnerved us			1
i ’m terrified that next time i ’m mowing the lawn i ’ll run over a bullet that has n’t been found yet			0
one of us could be seriously hurt			0
' we have friends with young children who could have put one of the bullets in their mouth , or one of our cats could have got hold of one - it does n’t bear thinking about			0
shocked : @entity8 and @entity7 stumbled upon a haul of ammunition in their rented home ' we were planning to be in this house for years - now we want to move out as soon as we can			1
the couple , who have been together for 10 years , moved into the rented house last september			1
mr @entity7 made the discovery earlier this month while using a rake to pull up long reeds from one of the two ponds			2
' something fell from the pile of weeds i ’d pulled out and it hit the paving stones with a clink			0
i did n’t think much about it until it happened again with the next pile - and i saw a flash of gold			0
' my first thought was ‘ @entity83 , i ’ve found treasure ! i was thrilled			0
' but i picked the metal up and realised it was a bullet			0
' mr @entity7 called alerted his partner ms @entity8 and headed to a friend ’s house - incredibly , with the bullets in his pocket			1
' it seems really stupid now but i did n’t realise they could be dangerous , i just wanted to find out what they were			0
my friend used to live on a farm and told me they were 2.2mm bullets			0
' i came home and looked in the pond for more - then we spotted some really big ones			2
' ms @entity8 added : ' i rang my dad because he used to be in the @entity103 , and he told us not to touch them because they could be dangerous			2
haul : the pond also contained 20 to 30 machine gun rounds , two shotgun cartridges , more than 50 9mm rounds and 30 8mm rounds ready to go : a view of police preparing to conduct search for bullets , from inside mr @entity7 and ms @entity8 's home he said they could have eroded over time and we should call the police straight away			1
it was at that point that we started to panic			0
' the couple dialled 101 and two officers arrived , quickly realised the seriousness of the situation , and called in @entity127 officers who alerted the fire brigade to drain the ponds because the underwater search unit was not available			0
search : a picture taken from inside the house shows police officers scouring the pond for hidden ammunition in mr @entity7 and ms @entity8 's garden before the pair knew what was happening , two fire engines pulled up , followed by two police vans - and their garden was taken over as a full - scale assessment took place			1
as an examination of the bullets deemed them not to be a risk , the couple were not evacuated , but officers stayed until 1am sifting through the sludge and mud in one of the ponds - where they found around 2,200 bullets - the majority of which were 2.2mm rifle rounds			2
but shockingly , the pond also contained 20 to 30 machine gun rounds , two shotgun cartridges , more than 50 9mm rounds and 30 8mm rounds			0
police assured the mr @entity7 and ms @entity8 they would be back the next day to search the second pond			1
ms @entity8 said : ' after the second seven - hour day , one of the officers asked me how many i thought they ’d found in that pond			1
' i thought it would maybe be the same amount as the first pond , and i could n’t believe it when he said they ’d found over 5,600 more			0
' the next day police brought metal detectors and did a full search of the house and garden to make sure there was no more hidden ammunition , before giving the couple the all - clear			1
' it ’s just mind - blowing , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' the police told me that they found more rounds of ammunition in our back garden than at the local arms store			2
' no stone unturned : a police officer in protective gear looks under the floorboards of the living room in the house while @entity198 have launched an investigation into how the ammunition ended up in the ponds , the couple have contacted their letting agent - who in turn , spoke to the landlord who now lives in @entity206			1
' he was astonished , and said he had no idea where it had come from , ' ms @entity8 said			2
' the house was empty for a year before we took it so we do n’t know what has happened			0
' it ’s sad because we love this house and have spent time and effort making it a home			2
and somebody somewhere has ruined that			0
i do n’t want to stay in a house where that kind of thing has been found in the garden			0
' mr @entity7 added : ' of course for our family and friends this is a great story , but for us , it ’s ruined our home			1
' concerned : mr @entity7 and ms @entity8 have expressed unease about continuing to live at their home in @entity236 after police drained their pond and found thousands of bullets probe : police have launched an investigation while the couple 's landlord , who lives in @entity206 , is said to be ' astonished ' at the find at his property in @entity236			1
