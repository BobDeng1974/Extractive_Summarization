he was acquitted of one further count of rape against one victim , and two indecent assaults against a further teenager			1
the abuse concerned the time @entity9 was a leading paediatrician at @entity23 , with much of it taking place within the hospital itself			1
allegations of sex assaults carried out by another doctor at the hospital were also recently investigated by @entity104 until it was discovered he had died			2
an @entity106 report into historic abuse carried out at @entity23 in light of the @entity110 allegations was delayed last year to gather new evidence and has yet to be published			1
the jury of seven men and five women had heard how @entity9 would examine young girls in a consulting room , when their parents were placed behind a screen or asked to leave the room			1
he would touch teenage girls ' breasts , with one woman speaking of being shown how to check herself for breast cancer , and another saying @entity9 ' squeezed ' her nipples			1

one patient recalled being asked to do balancing exercises with her top off before being subjected to an unnecessary intimate examination			0

he was the first person to be charged under @entity138 for offences at the hospital when eight women came forward in the wake of the @entity110 scandal			0
@entity144 , prosecuting , said there is ' no suggestion that this defendant abused a young female patient in concert with @entity4 '			2
' it â€™s simply that these allegations relate to a time when the other things were happening			0
' prolific child abuser @entity4 is believed to have carried out his worst offending at the hospital , where he had his own office with the @entity4 @entity159 charity in 1981			1
the court previously heard how @entity9 thought he was ' bomb - proof ' because no one would believe a child over him			1
during a police interview after he was arrested in 2013 , @entity9 described his victims as ' gold - diggers ' and fantasists			1
he said : ' as we know , teenagers are unreliable witnesses , their sexual fantasies often take over , become reality and i think you better explore that			0
this is nothing to do with ... i 've never done that			0
' defending @entity9 , barrister @entity177 previously said he had been ' hauled over coals , ' just as he was rebuilding his life			2
she said : ' he 's become a scapegoat for a time when too many people died before the winds of change blew			0
' but ms @entity185 said : ' this is n't a quick fumble in a car park , this is a concerted and repeated attacks on young women			0
he appears to have a total lack of understanding that what he did was wrong			0
@entity144 , prosecuting , said there was no suggestion that @entity9 had abused patients with @entity110 , but the offences had occurred around the same time ' in his view , it 's incredibly silly			1
his own behaviour indicates a total lack of moral compass			0
' she added : ' this is a case about trust			0
that trust is left in the hands of medical professionals every day			0
these girls were n't just ill with a snuffle or a cut knee , these girls were really ill. ' they were vulnerable , young , entrusted and trusting			2
that 's what gave him opportunity			0
that trust was breached by mr @entity9			2
' dressed in a smart navy suit with a blue pocket handkerchief , @entity9 showed no emotion as he listened to the verdicts being read out			2
@entity224 , chief prosecutor for the @entity225 and @entity226 said : ' @entity9 has been convicted today of offences which are particularly shocking due to the abuse of his position as a doctor taking advantage of the female patients in his care			2
' his crimes were extremely traumatic for his victims , who should have expected his support rather than this gross betrayal of their trust			0
' @entity9 used his status to molest these vulnerable young girls and women who felt unable to complain as he was a doctor , and many of whom only bravely came forward after seeing other cases in the media			2
' i hope they now feel that justice has been done			0
' detective sergeant @entity249 , from the child abuse investigation unit at @entity104 , said : ' @entity9 was a prolific sexual offender who abused his position of power in order for his own sexual gratification			2
' as a consultant paediatrician , he preyed on young girls who had been referred to him for a variety of health issues			0
' they trusted him , they believed him , because he was a doctor and they thought he was trustworthy			0
' on a number of occasions , he carried out unnecessary internal examinations on young girls			0
' although they felt uncomfortable at this , they did n't feel able to tell anyone because they believed the examinations must have been necessary			0
' some of the offences were committed while the child 's parent was just outside the room			0

@entity9 has been remanded in custody to await sentencing next week .			0
