@entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity14 6 not much he could do about it about @entity8 's opener , buried in the bottom left corner , but pulled off a smart save to keep out @entity19 's back - post header with @entity2 3 - 1 up			0
@entity20 6 becoming @entity2 's ever - present , if he 's not on the left - hand side in the league then he is deputising for @entity23 on the right			2

playing the no 10 role behind @entity81 he was not in his usual deeper central midfield role , but played just as well			0
@entity20 ( left ) is @entity2 's mr @entity83 and turned in another assured display @entity58 6.5 energetic on the left - hand side of the three attacking midfielders and much of @entity2 's forward play came down that side			1
@entity81 6 burly , bustling , good on the ball , a handful for @entity8 's defenders			0
