by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 19:20 est , 19 may 2012 former @entity2 chancellor : lord @entity0 @entity3 has been calling on those of our @entity6 partners who have the misfortune to have the euro to do what it takes to establish a ‘ stable , successful eurozone ’ – warning that otherwise ‘ we are in uncharted territory which carries huge risks for everybody ’			1
i fully understand why he felt obliged to say that			1
even though , fortunately , the @entity21 is not part of the eurozone , the issue is of such importance that he could scarcely remain silent			1
and had he spoken and not expressed the desire to see the eurozone ‘ succeed ’ he would have been held at least partially responsible for its failure			1
but it is , of course , complete nonsense			1
a successful eurozone is an impossibility			1
@entity34 , to give it its full name , was doomed from the start			1
the disaster which we see unfolding today , most acutely in @entity39 but increasingly elsewhere in the eurozone , too , was not only predictable but predicted			1
i first explained why it should not be embarked upon , and why it would be doomed to fail , when i was chancellor in january 1989 , and the proposal was about to be formally launched			1
i concluded in these terms : ‘ it is clear that @entity47 implies nothing less than @entity6 government – albeit a federal one – and political union : the @entity52 of @entity6			1
that is not on the agenda now , nor will it be for the foreseeable future			1
’ and i elaborated on this before the misbegotten project became a reality in 1999			1
a monetary union , for its very existence , requires there to be automatic , not occasional and discretionary , transfers from the more successful to the less successful parts of the union , which in turn requires there to be , at the very least , a single system of taxation and benefits			1
there also needs to be a high degree of central control of budget deficits			1
in other words , a single finance minister at the head of a single finance ministry within a single government			1
' doomed ' : the @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82			1
mr @entity0 first spoke out against @entity34 in 1989 even then , it would not be economically beneficial within an area as large and diverse as the @entity85			1
for political union needs to be buttressed by a high degree of labour mobility ( and also wage flexibility , which the so - called @entity6 social model regards as barbaric )			1
there is a high degree of labour mobility in the political and monetary union that is the @entity52 – as there is , too , between @entity96 and @entity97 within the @entity21			2
but linguistic and cultural differences mean that labour mobility within the eurozone is severely limited			2
so we have 25 per cent unemployment today in @entity103 ( and an even more horrific 50 per cent youth unemployment ) , while unemployment in @entity82 is little more than five per cent			2
but of course it was never an economic venture in the first place			2
it was always entirely political			2
the architects of @entity6 monetary union knew full well that it could not work without full - blooded political union , and that was their objective from the start			2
it is hard to imagine anything more arrogant and irresponsible			2
it was arrogant , since , in a democracy , political union requires the consent of the people , which plainly does not exist			2
i live half the time in @entity123 , and the people of @entity123 are no more inclined to surrender self - government than are the people of @entity21			2
and it was grossly irresponsible , since it was always clear that , should their gamble fail and political union prove unachievable , the consequences of monetary union alone would be as disastrous as we see unfolding today			0
desperation : people queue up at a job centre in @entity134 , @entity103 , where unemployment is at 25 per cent and 50 per cent for young people so where do we go from here ? the only rational course of action is for the member countries to recognise reality and embark on the dismantling of the eurozone , in as orderly way as possible , returning to separate national currencies			0
the exit of @entity39 from the eurozone , which is merely a matter of time , needs to be only the first step			0
in the short term , this will be unpleasant and costly			0
but the short - term cost will be as nothing compared with the continuing cost of an under - performing @entity6 economy , lurching from crisis to crisis until monetary union can be sustained no longer			0
the break - up of the @entity6 monetary union will not be the first time this has happened			0
for the most part , the ending of monetary union has followed the break - up of political union			0
most recently this occurred with the split of @entity170 into the @entity171 and @entity172 , and the break - up of the @entity174 , when the newly independent republics changed from the rouble to currencies of their own			0
the greatest problem this time is likely to be the threat of a @entity6 banking meltdown			0
the banks are already in an enfeebled condition following the excesses that led to the crash of 2008 ; and the near - 80 per cent write - down of @entity39 government debt is likely to be followed by further sovereign debt defaults			0
but this can be managed			0
responsibility : @entity3 has found himself obliged to support measures to save the eurozone the various governments of @entity6 will have to stand behind some of their banks ( although the terms on which they do so should be much tougher than has been the case hitherto ) , and the @entity198 will need to provide back - up where that is needed			0
but the cost of extrication from the economic doomsday machine that is the @entity6 monetary union , will be infinitely less than the cost of keeping the machine going and delaying the inevitable			0
@entity6 can prosper again , but only by throwing off the misbegotten shackles of the eurozone			0
meanwhile , even if @entity3 had to say what he did say , there is one sensible and important thing that he can do			0
he can make it clear that there is no way in which he will ask the @entity21 taxpayer to participate in the construction of firewalls , bail - outs , or any other devices designed to shore up a doomed monetary union			0
we can not afford to do it			0
we are not members of it – although , as the governor of the @entity226 pointed out last week , we suffer significantly from the collateral damage it is causing			0
but above all , it is in no one ’s interest – not ours , not @entity6 ’s , not the world ’s – to seek to sustain the unsustainable and prolong the great damage it is causing .			0
