by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 15:33 est , 22 january 2014 his family had already been decimated by the @entity4 when @entity5 appealed against being sent to the frontline			1
he 'd lost three brothers to the conflict - which still ranks as among the deadliest in human history , resulting in 16 million deaths and 20 million wounded			1
before the appeal was heard , a fourth had been killed			2
@entity5 's appeal for exemption from fighting in @entity4 was granted			1
he had already lost three brothers and was soon to have lost a fourth			1
his parents from @entity16 , also lost a son - in - law , and @entity5 appealed on the grounds of domestic hardship			1
the chairman of the panel wrote they were ' of the opinion that the mother is entitled to the comfort she will obtain by the retention of this last son '			1
and so , given the exceptional personal circumstances , and @entity5 's employment within the munitions industry , @entity5 - who died in 1975 - was granted an exemption			1
today the details of how 8,000 men tried to avoid conscription in the @entity4 , are released by the @entity34			1
they provide a unique and fascinating insight into the battles fought on the home front to avoid the bloody conflict			2
@entity40 was another one of thousands of men desperate to avoid a war			1
describing himself as a foreign correspondent and book - keeping clerk , his argument - that he should not be sent to fight on conscientious grounds , because of his socialist beliefs - was bluntly rejected			1
the tribunal chairman allegedly stated that , as a socialist , he could n't possibly have a conscience so he could not be regarded as a conscientious objector			1
the way @entity40 was dismissed was raised in @entity54 by an mp and @entity40 , 20 , from @entity56 , appealed			1
he lost this hearing too , but later appealed to the central tribunal			1
@entity5 lost four older brothers in the war and successfully appealed against conscription			1
his appeal is published online today by the @entity34			1
another man , butcher @entity63 , appealed on economic grounds in order to look after his shop			2
an exemption was granted by the tribunal - but it was only for one day , the shortest exemption granted by the tribunal			2
the tribunal decided that mr @entity63 had deliberately brought out a local competitor in an attempt to increase his business needs , and thus improve his chances of exemption			0
@entity80 whose parents migrated to @entity81 from @entity82 before 1914			2
he said his parents had fled @entity82 to escape military service and had been bought up to think that ' all warfare was wrong '			2
the 20 - year - old , from @entity87 , said that the family 's bakery and confectionery shop had been ' wrecked by the public owing to the bitter feeling against us being @entity82 '			2
he added : ' we were prevented from carrying on further business and grossly insulted in various ways			0
' he applied to be exempted as a conscientious objector but had his appeal dismissed			1
he went on to serve with the @entity98 , but in a labour battalion which did not leave @entity81			0
the fascinating papers also reveal the attitudes of local people to those seen as trying to escape their patriotic duty			0
@entity108 's shop was used in his appeal on economic grounds not to fight in @entity4			2
an anonymous letter to the tribunal , about @entity112 , questions why he is allowed to keep his butcher 's shop and not serve , while ' married men have had to shut up their shop and go '			2
mr @entity112 is subsequently described as ' a proper rotter of a man ' and a ' rotten shirker '			0
the writer of the letter had lost two sons in the war and was understandably aggrieved and heart - broken			1
@entity112 later served with the @entity124 and @entity125 between 1917 and 1918			0
@entity126 , a builder 's labourer from @entity87 , tried resisting conscription on the grounds that he had a brother in the army and was looking after his sister and widowed mother			1
the tribunal accepted evidence from a local military representative that the family would suffer ' no serious hardship ' , should he serve , because the sister could ' leave school and get employment '			0
thousands of papers from the @entity143 , which heard appeals between 1916 and 1918 , have been digitised as part of a series of events to mark the war 's centenary			1
the documents - one of only two complete surviving collections of tribunal records - reveal men seeking exemption on medical , family or economic grounds as well as the relatively small proportion wishing not to fight on moral grounds as conscientious objectors			1
@entity160 studies records of the @entity162 and @entity143 for @entity4 , released by the @entity34 the @entity34 said the papers offered an insight into personal circumstances , including letters , medical certificates , statements and even religious pamphlets , as well as business information			2
@entity171 , records specialist at the @entity34 , said : ' the conscription appeal records provide a different perspective of the @entity4 away from the battles , revealing the impact the war had on the home front			1
' digitising this collection opens up the records to allow people across the globe to discover the lesser - known stories of @entity4 for themselves			0
' of the 11,307 separate appeals heard between 1916 and 1918 , only 577 were conscientious objection cases , or just over 5 %			0
@entity108 was reported by a member of the public who had lost two sons in the war			2
@entity40 's appeal not to fight in @entity4 was subsequently dismissed			1
the majority of appeals were dismissed and many people did go on to see war service			0
the sensitive nature of the appeals against compulsory military service during and after the @entity4 has meant that only a small minority of the tribunal papers survive			0
in the years that followed the end of the war , the government issued instructions to the local government boards that all tribunal material should be destroyed , except for the @entity143 records and a similar set for @entity208 and @entity209 in @entity210 , which were to be kept as a benchmark for possible future use			1
@entity5 's appeal case has now been digitised in a series which contains 11,000 case papers from the @entity143 which heard appeals between 1916 and 1918			1
a sample of records from the @entity219 was also kept			0
the @entity220 of 1916 introduced compulsory conscription to @entity81 for the first time in modern history			0
before this act , the armed forces were generally made up of volunteers			0
while conscientious objection was not specifically defined in the act of 1916 , the government recognised those whose ' objection genuinely rests on religious or moral convictions '			0
only a small number of conscientious objectors were exempted from service absolutely			0
most were obliged to serve in non-combatant roles or faced courts martial			0
@entity81 abolished @entity238 in 1960			0
a women 's @entity240 booklet , published to highlight the roles that women were being employed to do , to substitute for men who could be freed to join the army , was published today in 1921 the @entity246 decided that all papers relating to individual cases of exemption from @entity238 and tribunal minute books ( except those of the @entity219 ) , should be destroyed			0
@entity4 began on july 28 , 1914 and lasted until november 11 , 1918			0
differences in foreign policies were to blame , although the immediate cause was the assassination of @entity257 € ™ s @entity256			0
the two main sides were the @entity259 , which included @entity260 , @entity81 and @entity261 ; and @entity82 and @entity262			0
in total , 30 countries were involved in the conflict			0
@entity266 , once part of the @entity268 with @entity82 and @entity262 , fought on the side of the @entity259			0
soldiers fought largely in trenches during the war , and thousands suffered from stress , known as shell - shock			2
over a million soldiers were killed in the infamous @entity277 alone , including about 30,000 in just one day .			0
