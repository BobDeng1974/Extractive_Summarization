by @entity0 @entity1 is relishing the prospect of an @entity5 - @entity4 battle for gold with childhood inspiration @entity7 at the @entity9			1
@entity1 , 20 , bagged a bronze in @entity11 four years ago to become @entity5 's first female @entity13 medallist			1
now she has her sights set on 58kg gold and thinks 34 - year - old breeze , who won gold in 2002 and 2006 and came out of retirement to compete at @entity9 , is the main obstacle in her path			1
excited : @entity1 is relishing an @entity5 - @entity4 battle for gold at the @entity13 @entity22 : @entity1 has her sights on 58kg gold and thinks @entity16 is her main obstacle to achieve it ' i think the gold may potentially be between myself and @entity7 , ' said @entity1			1
when i was young she was a bit of an idol for me and going head to head with her will be very exciting			1
there 's no animosity between the two of us			2
it 's a friendly games and , if i do n't win , i 'd want her to			2
' @entity1 had a spell out through injury in the aftermath of the @entity39 but is firing on all cylinders again now and is enjoying training under new coach @entity42			1
' i 've been working very well with him			2
he believes i 've got a chance to perform really well here and so do i , ' she said			0
' i 'm a little bit nervous because body weight is n't going down the way i kind of i hoped it would but , other than that , everything is really good			1
' i 'm feeling well prepared and training well			0
now i 've just got to go out there and do what i usually do			0
' @entity1 admits there are a lot of similarities between her @entity13 debut in @entity11 and that of 15 - year - old schoolgirl team - mate @entity57 , who competes at 69kg			1
' she 's a similar age and she 'll have the same kind do expectations and pressure from team - mates and the general public but i 'm sure she will perform , ' said @entity1			1
' i feel a lot more experienced this time			0
i 'm four years older , i would say four years wiser too but i guess that ' s up for debate ! ' @entity57 seems remarkably unfazed at the prospect of stepping into the @entity13 spotlight			1
competition : @entity7 could stand in @entity1 's way to a gold medal at the @entity13 in @entity1 's way : one highlight of the @entity13 could be a potential head to head in @entity75 ' things are going good , i 'm training hard , ' she said			1
' i 'm not nervous now , i think it will hit me on the day when i 'm on the platform			2
' i 'll have plenty of support though			0
my family , my neighbours , friends and teachers			0
' @entity1 may have more experience under her belt this time round but she still gets nervous and feels that often works to her advantage			1
' i 'm always a nervous wreck , ' she said			1
' i 'm always nervous about everything			2
i do get the adrenaline kick and sometimes it will keep me up at night			0
' the adrenaline will kick in after the weigh - in and when you 're warming up			0
i find it 's often a good thing to be honest			0
i can be warming up in the back room and feeling a bit heavy but then get out on the platform and the weights are flying			2
' @entity1 , who had her funding cut by @entity103 shortly after her @entity11 bronze because the governing body felt she was overweight , is confident that she , and other women lifters , are helping to make the sport more appealing for women			1
' i think there 's less of a stigma around it now , ' she added			0
' lifting weights is becoming more of a normal thing for women to do			0
it 's becoming a lot more fashionable so ideally we can be an inspiration to breaking down the social stigma around it			0
if the guys can do it , why ca n't the girls ? ' ready ? @entity1 admits she still becomes ' a nervous wreck ' but works it to her advantage when competing meanwhile @entity127 record holder @entity125 ( 77kg ) is expecting a tight battle for the medals in his class			1
' i 'm in good shape and i think there will only be a couple of kilos between first and fifth in 77kg , ' he said			0
' that should make it a good competition to watch			0
it 's harder if you 're in it knowing one lift will make the difference between first and fourth but we do want weightlifting to be exciting			0
' you get people coming to the @entity13 who have n't seen weightlifting live before and i think they find it pretty impressive when they see what the women and men are capable of lifting above their heads and the speed of it			2
it 's not something you see every day			0

@entity1 on 58kg category at @entity13 : ' i think the gold may potentially be between myself and @entity7 ( @entity16 ) '
' i like @entity7 . when i was young she was a bit of an idol for me , ' she adds
@entity1 admits she becomes ' a nervous wreck ' but works it to her advantage
