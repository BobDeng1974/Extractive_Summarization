parents have long complained that it is a daily struggle to drag their sleepy sons and daughters out of bed in the morning in time for lessons			1
but a new study aims to show that lie - ins and a delayed school start could actually help improve teenagers ’ exam results			1
this is because their body clocks are behind those of adults and they are less likely to be ‘ optimally alert ’ during morning lessons			1
a new study aims to show that lie - ins and a delayed school start could actually help improve teenagers ’ exam results ( file photo ) almost 32,000 @entity20 and 11 pupils ( aged 14 - 16 ) from 106 schools will take part in the @entity25 project , led by the @entity26 and @entity27			1
the scheme involves incorporating sleep education and 10am starts on to the secondary school curriculum and analysing the impact on gcse results			0
in the first year , a group of teenagers will be given sleep education – such as the benefits of getting enough rest – and the other control group will not			0
the following year , one group of students will start lessons at 10am , one will receive sleep education , a third will receive both and a fourth group will have neither , continuing with normal school starts of between 8.30 - 9am			2
pupils will be expected to keep sleep diaries and some will wear electronic devices , measuring the length of time they manage to rest each night			2
researchers will look at the impact on attainment of five good gcses including @entity57 and maths as well as other areas such as the effect of mobile phones and tablets on sleep			0
professor @entity64 , the director of the @entity26 and @entity27 , said that a teenager rising at 7am was the equivalent of 5am for an adult			1
he said : ‘ recent advances in our understanding of the neuroscience of sleep has shown that the body clock of teenagers is delayed			2
‘ this biology , along with the impact of social media and other sociocultural influences , delays bed and wake times and greatly shorten sleep			0
‘ our project will be the first large - scale randomised control trial to explore whether a later start to the school day , along with educational programmes regarding the importance of sleep , will have a positive impact upon both academic performance and overall health in the teenage population			1
it could also involve highlighting the benefits of getting a good night ’s rest to pupils , such as being more likely to win a place on a sports team if they are on top form and appearing more attractive to the opposite sex , researchers suggested ( file photo ) @entity103 , a professor of sleep medicine at @entity26 , said : ‘ we know something funny something happens when you ’re a teenager			1
you seem to be slightly out of sync with the rest of the world			0
‘ of course , your parents think that ’s probably because you ’re a little bit lazy and opinionated and if only you got to bed early at night , you ’d be able to get up in the morning			2
‘ but science is telling us in fact there are developmental changes during the teenage years , which lead to them actually not being as tired as we think they ought to be at normal bedtime and still sleepy in the morning			1
’ he added : ‘ what we ’re doing in the study is exploring the possibility that if we actually delay the school start time until 10am , instead of 9am or earlier , that additional hour taken on a daily dose over the course of a year will actually improve learning , performance , attainment and in the end school leaving qualifications			2
‘ if we adapt our system to the biological state of the young person , we might have more success than having to fit them into our schedules			0
’ the curriculum support will help youngsters understand the importance of sleep and eliminating distractions from electronic devices			0
it could also involve highlighting the benefits of getting a good night ’s rest to pupils , such as being more likely to win a place on a sports team if they are on top form and appearing more attractive to the opposite sex , researchers suggested			0
the sleep research is among six neuroscience projects awarded grants totalling almost £ 4million by the @entity156 and the @entity157 .			0
