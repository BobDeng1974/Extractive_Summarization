sir @entity0 enjoyed a glittering reign as @entity3 manager , but not all of his signings were successful at @entity6			1
as £ 20m winger @entity8 returns home to @entity10 after falling out of favour at @entity3 , we look back at some of @entity0 's worst signings during his @entity6 reign			1
homecoming : @entity8 was mobbed when arriving in @entity15 as he returns to @entity10 on a season - long loan @entity17 he cost £ 4.5m in 1999 and played only the four times			1
dubbed the @entity19 by the tabloid press , @entity17 returned to @entity21 within six months			2
his blooper against @entity23 , as the ball squirmed under his body , ensures his name will never be forgotten			2
blooper : @entity17 is remembered for his howler against @entity23 @entity29 signed from @entity30 to replace @entity31 but beset by injury problems and inconsistency			2
in his book last year , @entity0 described @entity29 as a ' terrible professional '			1
' we played down at @entity37 and @entity29 was tucking into everything : sandwiches , soups , steaks			0
he was going through the menu			0
we arrived back in @entity43 , and @entity29 was on mobile phone to a @entity46 restaurant to order a takeaway			0
is there no end to you ? i just could n't make an impact on him			0
' replaced as @entity3 's first - choice keeper by @entity55			1
damning : @entity29 was described as a ' terrible professional ' by sir @entity0 @entity57 looked like @entity58 but played nothing like him			1
horror show against @entity61 in a 4 - 1 defeat sealed his fate			2
in his autobiography , @entity64 recounted a conversation with @entity67			0
' @entity57 was another one i was mocked for			0
even @entity67 , in that high - pitched way , said to me one day : ' @entity71 , did you have @entity57 ? ' @entity73 ' face dropped as he waited for the response			2
' @entity76 , we had him on trial once , ' i snapped			0
' on trial ? ' @entity67 squeaked back			0
' a two - game trial ? ' ' yes , and it was a disaster			2
@entity80 a centre - half signed in the early days by @entity0 in a £ 45,000 deal from @entity83			1
played only once in four years for the club in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity23 in march 1991			2
@entity87 - @entity86 so bad they named him twice , @entity87 was signed to add steel to the @entity3 midfield but departed after 18 months			1
he is , however , an @entity92 winner after being part of the @entity3 side that lifted the trophy in 2004			1
good quiz question , that			0
what has @entity87 won that @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 have not ? misfit : @entity87 helped @entity3 win the @entity92 in 2004 but was soon out of the club @entity104 the £ 28.1m signing who was billed as a superstar			1
could never quite get to grips with the physicality of the @entity111 game and despite some magical moments in the @entity114 , he underwhelmed			0
@entity3 did , however , reclaim £ 15m when he was sold to @entity116 two seasons after his arrival			1
costly : @entity104 never justified the large transfer fee @entity3 payed for him @entity119 a @entity122 @entity121 winner in 2002 , @entity3 spent £ 6m to bring @entity119 to @entity6 from @entity123 one year later , seeing off competition from @entity125			1
@entity0 said at the time : ' one of the reasons we sold @entity104 was because we knew we were getting @entity119 - that shows how highly we regard his talent			1
' he was the first @entity122 to sign for @entity3			1
now we 'll get onto the second one ... big stage : @entity119 won the @entity121 with @entity133 in 2002 before moving to @entity6 @entity134 signed from @entity135 in a deal worth in excess of £ 19m , @entity134 had previously been tracked by @entity116 and @entity138			1
his first season was a success as @entity3 won the @entity114 in 2008 but he failed to kick on , suffering injury problems and a visible lack of fitness			1
he was voted best player at the @entity145 in 2005 but is now surplus to requirements at @entity3 and will be sold if @entity3 can find a buyer			1
surplus : @entity134 failed to kick on at @entity3 after his big - money move from @entity135 @entity151 signed on a free transfer from @entity153 in 2004			1
in @entity155 , they referred to him as ' the future of @entity155 football ' or the ' next @entity159			0
' scored only twice - in @entity161 ties against @entity162 and @entity163 - and ended up at @entity164 under @entity159 , where he fared better but was eventually transfer - listed			2
@entity159 said : ' if you are driving to work do n't get in the car with @entity151 because he has more car crashes than anyone i know			0
it 's nothing to do with him as a player or as a lad			0
if he is late once or twice , even three or four times , maybe well and good , but when it is five , six or seven times then you have to draw the line			0
' high hopes : @entity151 was described as ' the future of @entity155 football ' and the ' next @entity159 ' @entity185 the most bizarre of @entity0 's signings , brought in to the club on the recommendation of @entity189 despite the manager never having watched him either live or on television			1
the £ 7m winger did not start a @entity194 game in his four - year spell with the club , exiting this summer to @entity196			1
blind faith : @entity0 never watched @entity185 play but still spent £ 7m to bring him to @entity3 @entity198 at an @entity200 dinner in 2009 , @entity0 admitted @entity198 , who scored only three goals in his first season at the club , was his worst signing : ' i only paid £ 170,000 but i still get condemned for it			1
' the forward exited @entity3 in 1991 and joined @entity208 , the now defunct @entity210 club			2
@entity211 a £ 1.5m gamble from @entity164 in 2003			0
had raw pace and a decent finisher but some way short of the required quality			0
scored eight goals in two seasons before being moved on			0
dry : @entity211 scored eight goals in two seasons at @entity6 before being sold @entity221 the first @entity46 player to play for @entity3 arrived in 2004 but could not play until 2006 due to work permit issues			1
appeared once in the @entity161 in a 2 - 0 defeat at home by @entity226 and also came on a substitute in one game in the @entity114			2
his contract was terminated in 2008			0
he did not score any goals but he may well have sold some shirts			0
absence : @entity221 did n't feature for @entity3 for his first two years due to work permit problems @entity235 @entity0 's final signing has endured a miserable time at @entity6 and is still to start a @entity194 game			1
@entity239 felt that @entity241 's work on the training ground was short of the required standard and he was loaned to @entity244 in january , where he struggled once more			0
he was part of the group that toured the @entity247 but was not in the @entity3 squad that faced @entity249 last weekend and could leave the club in the next fortnight			2
underwhelming : @entity235 arrived from @entity252 with a big reputation but has n't broke through @entity254 the @entity255 forward signed from @entity256 in 2002 but took 27 matches to score his first goal			0
he went on to score 17 in 95 appearances and is most famously remembered for scoring twice in a victory at @entity262			0
' he came from @entity255 , and made the @entity263 cry , ' went the ditty			0
since leaving , he proved himself as a brilliant goalscorer with @entity266 and @entity267			0
wait : @entity254 took 27 matches to score his first goal for @entity3 video @entity254 scores another brace			2
