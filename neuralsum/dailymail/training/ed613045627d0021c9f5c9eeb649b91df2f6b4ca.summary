@entity0 has admitted paying tradesmen in cash , after a government minister said it was ' morally wrong ' to do so @entity5 claimed that making small cash payments to cleaners and tradesmen was as bad as tax avoidance , which ministers have already called ‘ morally repugnant ’			1
the exchequer secretary spoke out as he gave a speech outlining plans to name and shame those who engage in aggressive tax avoidance schemes to avoid paying their fair share			0
@entity0 , mayor of @entity18 , has admitted paying cash - in - hand after @entity20 minister @entity5 , right , claimed such behaviour was ' morally wrong ' but asked today if he had ever paid in cash to keep costs down , @entity18 mayor @entity0 said : ' i 've certainly paid a lot of cash in hand			1
' under new rules , celebrities and millionaires who use tax avoidance schemes will see their details passed to @entity34			0
but mr @entity5 raised eyebrows by suggesting that pensioners and families who pay cash to a cleaner , plumber or gardener are just as bad			1
he said : ‘ getting a discount with your plumber by paying cash in hand is something that is a big cost to the @entity48 and means others must pay more in tax			1
’ asked explicitly if he disapproves of the practice , he said : ‘ yes , i think it ’s morally wrong			1
’ he added : ‘ it is illegal for the plumber but it is pretty implicit in these circumstances that there is a reason why there is a discount for cash			2
that is a large part of the hidden economy			1
’ the @entity63 calculates that the tax gap in @entity65 - the difference between what is owed and what is collected - is about £ 35 billion each year			1
hidden economy : a woman pays a workman , handing over cash ( posed by models ) tax avoidance accounts for around £ 5 billion of the missing cash			1
a @entity77 study earlier this year estimated the size of the black economy at £ 160 billion a year , more than 10 per cent of the entire economy and larger than the size of the deficit			0
@entity5 has branded those who avoid tax as ‘ morally ’ questionable – but he is open to charges of hypocrisy			1
in 2006/7 , mr @entity5 used his parliamentary expenses to ensure that taxpayers bore the cost of his stamp duty payments when he moved house			1
he claimed £ 10,248.32 in ‘ mortgaged payments ’ on his second home that year			2
that broke down as ‘ @entity95 ’ of £ 8,550			2
the rest was accumulated solicitors ’ fees , land registry and property searches			0
he was later cleared of any wrongdoing and has not had to pay any of the money back			0
@entity34 have launched a series of tax campaigns over the past year , raising more than £ 500m , by persuading people from different sectors of business to encourage them to come forward and pay any tax they may not have declared			2
these campaigns have included ones focusing on plumbers and electricians			0
a campaign on trades more generally , including home repair , maintenance and improvement , will follow at the end of this year or early next year			0
there is no law against paying someone in cash or asking to be paid in cash but traders can use cash payments to avoid declaring all their income or by dodging @entity128			0
but @entity63 officials say customers should be ‘ good citizens ’ by not accepting cash work without a receipt			1
@entity134 mp @entity133 , a member of the @entity135 accused the @entity63 of operating ‘ double standards ’ by threatening ordinary people who pay for jobs in cash while failing to get to grips with widespread corporate tax avoidance			1
‘ everyone should be paying their fair share in taxes but this could end up being ridiculous			0
‘ it would be ridiculous if a pensioner paying a fiver cash in hand to someone to prune their roses was put through the tax system			2
‘ at the same time there are huge numbers of rich people and major companies who are not paying anything like the tax they should be doing			1
’ mr @entity5 published a consultation document yesterday spelling out ways to crack down on cowboy accountants who run rogue tax avoidance schemes			1
in future , they will have to give up their client lists and will remain liable even if they close the schemes or move companies			0
the announcement came after comedian @entity175 admitted to making a “ terrible error of judgment ” when it emerged he used a complex scheme to reduce his tax bill			0
the @entity182 tax - avoidance scheme @entity175 is said to have used enables members to pay income tax rates as low as 1 per cent			1
retort : a @entity134 mp said it was ' ridiculous ' to put small payments such as five pounds for cleaning and gardening through the tax system mr @entity5 said : ‘ these schemes damage our ability to fund public services and provide support to those who need it			1
they undermine the actions of the vast majority of taxpayers , who pay more in tax as a consequence of others enjoying a free ride			0
@entity77 leaders said the government would be better off closing the loopholes used by avoidance schemes			0
@entity209 , @entity210 general secretary , said : ‘ successive governments have run shy of reforms to ensure the very wealthiest pay their fair share of tax			2
‘ but with countries around the world under pressure to reduce deficits , fair tax is an economic necessity			2
’ the @entity221 ’ @entity220 said ministers needed to concentrate on reforming the complex tax system			2
@entity224 , director of the @entity225 , said : ‘ the government is right to act to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax , but new powers to uncover specific abuses are a poor substitute for serious reform of the tax system so that there are fewer loopholes			0
‘ ministers need to be more realistic about @entity34 ’s ability to clamp down when its resources are so stretched simply administering our hideously complicated taxes , let alone chasing those finding creative and legally dubious ways around them			0
‘ with a better tax system , @entity34 staff can focus their attention on tackling those who are abusing the system			0
proper reforms can ensure that everyone pays no more , and no less , than their fair share			0

@entity20 minister @entity5 said he disapproves of the practice
he said *non-taxed* house services such as plumbing , cleaning and gardening is ' a large part of the hidden economy '
@entity134 mp @entity133 , accused the @entity63 of operating ‘ double standards ’ by threatening ordinary people while they let corporate tax - dodgers slip through the net
