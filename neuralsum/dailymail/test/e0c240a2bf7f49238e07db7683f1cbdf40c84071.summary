one can only imagine the gloomy mood that must have collectively descended on the @entity3 's headquarters at @entity4 last week when reading about the acts of selflessness of the new masters champion , @entity7			1
shortly after being presented with the green jacket , the man who has rapidly become everyone 's favourite @entity8 flew to @entity12 and gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours			1
then , despite the obvious fatigue , he flew to @entity16 to keep his promise to play the heritage tournament — his fourth event in a row — because , well , they were good to him on the way up and he wanted to pay them back			1
@entity7 hits a tee shot on the eighth hole during the final round of the @entity27 @entity7 has competed in four events in a row as the new masters champion shows his commitment to the sport there was more			1
what about two tournaments coming up next month in his home state ? yes , i 'll be playing because they 're ' hometown events ' , he said			2
he also committed to the @entity38 in @entity39 next week because it is a @entity41 event , and the @entity42 in @entity43 the following week because it is the tour 's flagship competition			2
now , by way of stark contrast , let 's return to the @entity3 and their flagship event , also being played next month when the @entity50 is staged at @entity4			1
given that @entity51 won an unprecedented three majors last year plus the @entity53 , not surprisingly they wanted to put on quite a celebration			0
@entity7 attends the 50th @entity55 at the @entity56 on sunday night the new masters champion poses with singers @entity58 ( centre ) and @entity60 ( left ) on sunday night only trouble is , three of the high - profile members of that winning team at @entity64 will not be present			1
local favourite @entity65 , world no 3 @entity68 and world no 10 @entity67 have decided not to play			1
in the past all three have made no secret of the fact they do n't care for @entity4 and all three have poor records in the event			1
does n't that make it an obvious event to cut from a busy schedule ? you can see the argument			0
but , equally , as @entity7 at the age of just 21 is effortlessly showing , sometimes it 's simply about doing the right thing			1
yes , @entity65 and @entity68 , in particular , can put forward persuasive cases as to how they do their bit for @entity51 golf			1
@entity65 is doing plenty behind the scenes to ensure the relaunched @entity91 masters at @entity92 in october will be a great success ; @entity68 plays more tournaments round the world than any other top player and the nasty bout of flu that ruined his chance at the @entity90 was a sure sign he needs to cut back			1
all the same , the feeling lingers this admirable pair have got this one wrong			0
@entity50 have done a fabulous job with this tournament			1
it has grown to become an integral part of @entity109 's sporting summer			0
@entity65 watches his second shot on the first hole during the final round of the @entity27 ' it may be my last masters next year			1
the distance is ebbing away from this old body and the handwriting is on the wall			0
’ not just his final @entity120 this summer , but it looks as if 65 - year - old @entity123 is ready to call it a day at @entity125 as well			1
this year he shot 71 in the first round to become the oldest player to break par in @entity90 history			0
he followed it by making the halfway cut in the @entity132 in @entity16 last week , and shooting 69 in the third round			2
clearly , he ’s determined to go out with head unbowed			0
the prize fund at € 5million is handsome and the players are treated regally , with a top - class players ' lounge and free accommodation thrown in at the five - star @entity140 in @entity142			2
equally , they do n't do this as an act of benevolence			0
they do this on the presumption that everyone will turn up			0
so imagine how they must be feeling			0
yes , it will still be a great event with world no 1 @entity155 and @entity90 runner - up @entity153 competing , while @entity158 @entity157 is making his debut			2
but they could be forgiven for looking at the revived @entity120 the following week featuring just as many star names for less than half of their investment and taking place on one of the world 's great golf courses in @entity169 to boot , and questioning their largesse			0
pleasing all tournament sponsors is , of course , an impossible task , even if @entity7 appears determined to try			2
but there are some events where players ought to feel an obligation to play			2
their own flagship event is surely one			0
@entity179 's @entity68 watches his tee shot on the fourth hole during the @entity27 @entity182 will be @entity184 's last open twenty - five years after his runaway victory at @entity182 , sir @entity184 will play in his last @entity120 at the @entity186 this july			1
thus , the greatest @entity91 player of the modern era will bow out over the @entity189 like so many of the @entity158 legends , such as @entity191 and @entity192			0
with innovative new grandstands dramatically increasing the capacity around the fabled 17th and 18th holes , it will be a fitting place to say goodbye in every sense			0
‘ i look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as i cross that storied bridge , ’ said sir @entity184 , whose 58th birthday falls on the saturday of the event			0
legendary golfer @entity184 is set to make his final @entity120 appearance at @entity182 in july when he turns 58			0

shortly after being presented with his green jacket , new masters champion @entity7 gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours in @entity12
then , despite his fatigue , the 21 - year - old flew to @entity16 to keep a promise and play in the heritage tournament - his fourth event in a row
by contrast , players on the @entity3 have not shown the same sort of *unwavering* commitment to the sport
@entity65 , @entity68 and @entity67 have decided not to play at the @entity50 being staged at @entity4 next month
