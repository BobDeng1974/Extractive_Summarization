@entity0 remains bullish about his chances of being fit for the @entity2 , despite suffering a knee injury in @entity5 's draw with @entity6 on wednesday			1
the @entity8 midfielder is expected to be sidelined for between 10 days and three weeks to leave boss @entity9 with a difficult decision to make			2
@entity0 has a slight strain in his medial ligaments and not a tear			0
it gives the 20 - year - old – who was seen leaving the team hotel for training with his team mates in @entity19 , with a brace on his right knee			0
video : scroll down for @entity24 's @entity23 's @entity5 v @entity6 game report worry : @entity0 was forced into an early exit against @entity6 after picking up a knee injury awkward : @entity6 midfielder @entity28 landed awkwardly on the knee of the midfielder however , he has not given up hope of featuring in the @entity2			1
he tweeted : ' gutted to have picked up an injury yesterday			0
i 'm staying positive and getting to work with the medical team on recovery ... fingers crossed ! ' @entity5 ’s first game is on saturday week against @entity38 in @entity39 but @entity9 must decide whether to gamble on the fitness of a player who has been beset by injuries this season			1
concern : @entity9 said it is too early to make a decision on what happens next with @entity0 replacement ? @entity48 is on the stand - by list for @entity5 exit : @entity0 was seen on wednesday leaving the @entity51 visibly upset despair : the @entity5 midfielder will hope his @entity2 dream is not over blow : @entity0 looks distraught after suffering an injury against @entity6 in pain : @entity5 players look glum as they surround the hurt @entity8 midfielder hurt : @entity0 will have a scan to check the full extent of the damage performed : the youngster put in a terrific performance in @entity19 before he was forced off the official @entity5 @entity67 feed posted : ' @ @entity68 sustained a medial knee ligament injury against @entity6			1
the team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury			1
' @entity0 suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the season and has been troubled by a groin injury during the final weeks of the season			0
the game against @entity6 in @entity19 was his first start for nearly two months but he has been able to complete all the intensive @entity5 fitness work since the squad assembled last month			2
he may lack match sharpness but looked in good touch during the 2 - 2 draw on wednesday night			1
@entity9 may opt to take @entity0 to @entity84 and delay his final decision			2
the squad lists were lodged with @entity87 earlier this week but teams are allowed to make changes if there is a new injury , up 24 hours before their first game			0
there is nothing to stop the @entity5 boss calling in a player who is not on the stand - by list but @entity9 may well turn to @entity98 or @entity99 because they have been with the squad for more than two weeks and have done all the acclimatisation training			2
there appear to be no plans to send him home at the moment			0
you 're off : @entity108 will miss the friendly against @entity110 after he was sent off			0

@entity8 star hopeful of making *speedy* recovery to play some part in @entity84
scans *reveal* extent of midfielder 's knee injury after taking a knock during @entity5 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity6
will certainly miss friendly with @entity110 and first group match with @entity38
may not return until well into the *knockout* stages if @entity5 *qualify*
@entity9 must decide whether to call up @entity48 or @entity127 from stand - by list
@entity5 say that ' team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury '
