by @entity0 last updated at 10:25 am on 8th december 2011 @entity1 ran up the massive bill after calling and texting his first love when @entity1 got his first girlfriend it was understandable that he wanted to spend every possible moment talking to her			2
but sadly @entity1 soon learned that love comes at a price - £ 912 to be exact			2
the 14 - year - old left his mother @entity10 stunned after running up the staggering amount in his phone bill for just one month			1
ms @entity10 , who says she has forgiven her son , has now called on mobile phone companies to prevent the problem by creating spending limits			1
@entity1 , who goes to @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , went over his 300 - minute allowance last month - increasing his bill from the usual £ 28 a month to more than £ 900			1
his mother says phone company @entity24 , who the contract is with , should have registered the usage as ' out of the ordinary '			2
ms @entity10 , from @entity29 , also thinks mobile companies should send warnings when the bill gets close to the limit			0
she said : ' @entity1 got a girlfriend and was using the phone in the middle of the night and at lunch times at school to talk to her			0
it is quite sweet but when i realised what the bill was i nearly had a heart attack			0
' i think it ’s shocking that companies like 02 do n’t give you a warning when you get close to the allowance			2
@entity1 's mother @entity10 ( pictured ) said @entity24 should have warned him when he was over his monthly limit ' they do it with data usage - like the internet - and i just do n’t understand why they do n’t let you know that you are running up a bill			1
' ms @entity10 said that , in the three years that @entity1 has had his phone , he has only gone over his allowance once , and then only by about £ 10			1
phone giant @entity24 has asked ms @entity10 to pay £ 168 a month to clear the debt she added : ' he ’s never done anything like this before and has been a really responsible kid			1
' both @entity1 and i thought there was a warning text or phone call to ensure he did n’t breach his allowances			0
' @entity24 have now asked ms @entity10 to pay £ 168 a month to clear the debt			1
and have blocked the use of the phone until the bill is paid off			0
she said : ' i just ca n’t believe they have shown so little understanding in this matter			0
' a spokesman for @entity24 said : ' many parents prefer to provide their children with @entity83 phones which give them more control over the bills			0
' we have a wide range of tariffs to suit different usage levels and customer ’s can change these to suit their individual circumstances			0

@entity1 is on £ 28 - a - month @entity24 contract
