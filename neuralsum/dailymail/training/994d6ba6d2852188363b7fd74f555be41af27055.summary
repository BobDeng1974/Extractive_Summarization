by @entity1 reporter published : 13:29 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 18:14 est , 14 january 2014 a kind - hearted couple splashed out over £ 9,000 to fly 17 rescue animals from @entity5 to their home in @entity7 to save them from being put down			1
@entity8 and her husband @entity9 brought the 15 dogs and two cats almost 5,000 miles across the @entity12 to their country home in the hills above @entity16			1
mrs @entity8 said she just could not bear to abandon the animals after discovering them at farm where they were kept in cages and bred continuously			1
compassion : @entity8 with three of the dogs she rescued in @entity5 and flew back to her home in @entity7 the mental health counsellor said : ' i had a small rescue sanctuary which was mostly retired breeding dogs i rescued from a puppy mill that was closing down			1
' the dogs were going to be euthanised so i rescued them			2
' i had 40 dogs at one point , half were from the puppy mill and the rest were strays i ’d rescued and pets my clients could n’t look after any more			2
' last year mrs @entity8 , who is originally from @entity40 , decided to move back home to @entity7 with her husband after 17 years in @entity43 and tried to rehome the animals			1
some were successful and found new homes but many were returned to the sanctuary and the couple decided they had no choice but to take them			0
@entity51 : the animals were flown almost 5,000 miles from @entity53 in @entity5 to @entity54 in @entity7 the dogs , which include poodles and a boxer as well as mixed breeds , and the two cats had a 24 - hour journey including a flight from the animal sanctuary at @entity63 to their new home at @entity54			1
mrs @entity8 , 51 , said : ' it ’s cost us around $ 15,000 - about £ 9,000			1
in my view animal lives are just as important as human lives			0
' people were saying : ‘ why do n’t you put them in a shelter ? ’ but i had rescued them from a horrible situation where they had been in cages all their lives			2
it was worth the expense to keep them with me			0
' they are doing really well and love the space we have here			0
' the couple raised £ 70 through an online appeal to help with the cost of flights and said they would welcome further assistance , possibly from animal charities			0
they would also consider rehoming suitable animals to good homes			2
paws for applause : mrs @entity8 pictured with her husband @entity9			1
the couple say they are now looking for suitable homes for some of the rescued animals mrs @entity8 added : ' i ’m not going to do any more rescuing			1
' i ’d be interested in finding homes for them over here and anybody interested in providing one can get in touch			0
' out there [ @entity43 ] people have a very different view of animals and pet owning			0
' it ’s pretty much a third world country with stray dogs in the streets			0
' i feel @entity120 people have a better concept of caring for animals			0
' you rarely see dogs roaming the streets whereas in @entity5 it was normal to see strays with their bones sticking out			0
