by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:46 pm on 4th august 2011 @entity2 today faced calls from the @entity5 chairman to return to the @entity6 to answer ' very serious questions ' over allegations of phone hacking			1
conservative mp @entity10 said the @entity12 star and former @entity14 editor could be quizzed by police , as others said @entity2 could ' add more light ' to the phone hacking investigation			1
mr @entity2 has been accused of bragging about listening to personal voicemails by @entity20 who claimed her phone had been hacked by journalists from the paper			1
@entity24 claims : @entity20 , right , accused @entity2 , left , of bragging about listening in to voicemail messages left for her by ex-husband sir @entity27 @entity20 claimed that a senior @entity29 journalist admitted hacking voicemails left for her by sir @entity27			1
but mr @entity10 said mr @entity2 would not immediately be called in front of the @entity32 , which is investigating phone hacking , because the police inquiry ' has to be the priority '			2
sir @entity27 's former wife told @entity38 's @entity37 that the journalist made the admission in 2001			0
the @entity38 , which declined to name the journalist allegedly involved , said it was not mr @entity2 , who was editor of the @entity14 at the time			2
mr @entity2 issued a statement describing ms @entity20 ' claims as ' unsubstantiated '			2
@entity45 mp @entity44 , a member of the @entity5 , called on mr @entity2 to help the police in the light of the ' very strong ' new evidence			0
' i just hope that the police take the evidence and go with it and if mr @entity2 wants to come back to the @entity6 and help them with their inquiries - and i do n't mean being arrested in any way - i 'm sure he can add more light , ' she told @entity37			1
sir @entity27 : @entity2 wrote how the @entity57 had sung @entity58 in his message to miss @entity20 ' i think it would help everybody , including himself and this investigation , if he was able to say more about why he wrote what he did in 2006			1
' mr @entity10 told the @entity65 channel : ' what @entity44 has said is absolutely right - i would like to see mr @entity2 come back to this country and answer what are some very serious questions			2
' he said the committee did not have the power to compel people to return to the @entity6 to face questions			2
' now he may return to the @entity6 , i hope he will return to the @entity6 and i imagine that there will be some questions which will be put to him , possibly by the police on the basis of the evidence that has emerged , ' he said			1
' but at the moment , we ca n't do that			0
i 'm sure the committee will want to talk about it when we meet but @entity83 is in recess at the moment , the police investigation is ongoing			0
' and the police investigation has to be the priority			0
' in 2006 , @entity2 wrote an article , published in the @entity1 , saying : ' at one stage i was played a tape of a message @entity27 had left for @entity20 on her mobile phone			1
' ' the couple had clearly had a tiff , @entity20 had fled to @entity97 , and @entity27 was pleading with her to come back			2
' he sounded lonely , miserable and desperate , and even sang ' @entity58 ' into the answerphone			0
' @entity45 mp @entity44 , left , and @entity100 deputy leader @entity99 , right , have called on @entity2 to answer questions on the phone hacking scandal miss @entity20 told @entity37 : ‘ there was absolutely no honest way that @entity2 could have obtained that tape that he has so proudly bragged about unless they had gone into my voice messages			1
’ @entity29 , publisher of the @entity14 , said all its journalists work within the law			0
and @entity2 himself today took to @entity113 to comment on the calls for him to return , as he tweeted : ' so heart - warming that everyone in @entity6 's missing me so much they want me to come home # swoon '			1
but after hearing miss @entity20 's accusations , ms @entity44 called on @entity2 to return to the @entity6 to help the police with their inquiries in the light of the ' very strong ' new evidence			1
' i just hope that the police take the evidence and go with it and if mr @entity2 wants to come back to the @entity6 and help them with their inquiries - and i do n't mean being arrested in any way - i 'm sure he can add more light , ' she told @entity37			1
' i think it would help everybody , including himself and this investigation , if he was able to say more about why he wrote what he did in 2006			0
' @entity2 took to @entity113 to make light of the calls for him to return to the @entity6 @entity100 deputy leader ms @entity99 also called for mr @entity2 to return to this country to answer questions			1
she said : ' it 's not good enough for @entity2 just to say he 's always stayed within the law			0
there are questions about what happened with @entity20 ' phone messages that he needs to answer			2
' the public rightly expects that we will get to the bottom of phone hacking			0
that 's why it is so important that the police investigation looks at all the evidence and leaves no stone unturned			0
' and it is why we insisted on a full police investigation and the judicial inquiry having the powers and broad remit to get to the bottom of illegal practices in our media			0
' last night @entity2 said : ' i have no knowledge of any conversation any executive from other newspapers at @entity29 may or may not have had with @entity20			0
' @entity2 said that in the divorce case between sir @entity27 and miss @entity20 , mr @entity170 described miss @entity20 as ' a less than impressive witness ' and her evidence as ' not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid '			1
he added : ' and to reiterate , i have never hacked a phone , told anyone to hack a phone , nor to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone			0
