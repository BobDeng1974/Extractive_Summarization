by @entity1 reporter published : 05:30 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 15:44 est , 28 august 2012 a four - year - old girl denied an operation that could help her walk because of an @entity6 postcode lottery will now have the procedure - after well - wishers raised £ 30,000			1
@entity9 suffers from cerebral palsy - causing painful spasms in her legs - and can only shuffle a few steps at a time in her walking frame			1
she will be unable to walk without a £ 30,000 operation , equipment and physio which is only performed at one hospital in @entity18 - which happens to be just 12 miles away from her home			1
@entity9 , 4 , suffers from cerebral palsy and can only shuffle a few steps at a time in her walking frame			1
she will be unable to walk without an operation costing £ 30,000 - the amount well - wishers have raised but her local @entity26 ruled that @entity9 's case was not strong enough to justify the cost			1
her determined family ploughed straight into fundraising for the four - hour operation themselves in a bid to help @entity9 walk before she reaches school in september			1
her story was featured on @entity35 in january and the money was raised in just seven months			1
@entity9 's mother @entity37 , 28 , said she was so grateful to the fundraisers and looking forward to @entity9 dancing and playing like her friends			2
she said : ' it 's brilliant , amazing			2
i ca n't even describe how it feels to know we have got the money now and are just waiting for a date			0
' i did n't think we would be able to do it so quickly and thought it would take about a year			0
everyone has been amazing and i do n't think there was an event we had to plan for ourselves			0
' people just rang us and said they were doing this and doing that and took over all of it , which was really helpful			0
for people to take that stress away from us was wonderful			0
' there have been people we do n't even know who have donated a lot of money and we can not thank them enough			0
' @entity63 , 4 , with her mother @entity37 , 28 , in the park near their home in @entity69 thank you : @entity71 and @entity37 with children @entity72 and @entity74			1
@entity9 will now have surgery after the family managed to raise £ 30,000 accounts worker @entity37 , who lives in @entity77 , @entity69 , with partner @entity78 , 31 , their son @entity72 and @entity9 , said people had held cake sales , sponsored walks and cycle rides to raise money for the operation			0
@entity9 has already had her assessment and knows that the operation will involve neurosurgeon @entity88 ' taking out the bad bits ' in her legs			1
she will then have to remain in @entity91 for three weeks as an inpatient and will need a further two or three weeks of recovery			0
the extra £ 5,000 will help fund equipment to help @entity74 after her surgery , as well as additional physiotherapy , costing £ 50 an hour			1
@entity74 , pictured on 1st march 2008 , was born 10 weeks early @entity37 added : ' more and more often @entity97 wakes with pains in her legs and for us the main thing is about taking that away			1
' she goes to bed with tight fabric wrapped around her legs and she had to wear splints every day , which is not good when it is hot			2
' we have done this to get rid of all that and make her more comfortable			0
we have always said that whatever the operation does on top of that is a bonus			0
' we are looking at about six weeks out of school but at least she will get to start and get to know everybody else before , as it will be a lot to deal with getting used to the new feelings in her legs			2
' hopeful : @entity37 hopes that the selective dorsal rhizotomy will give @entity74 better use of her legs following physiotherapy @entity9 was delivered ten weeks early after @entity37 suffered a fall and she spent the first seven weeks of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit			1
brain scans at @entity126 in @entity69 showed she had cerebral palsy			1
the operation - called a selective dorsal rhizotomy - can be carried out on children aged four to 11 and involves cutting some of the nerve fibres between the muscles and spinal cord			2
a neurosurgeon goes in through the back of the patient while they are under general anaesthetic and tests the nerves with electrical impulses			0
any nerves acting abnormally are then cut			0
patients who have the operation require physiotherapy costing around £ 10,000 for several months afterwards			0
although the @entity146 says the procedure can be provided by the @entity6 it says parents should be warned the procedure is irreversible			2
there is also a risk of complications and patients could experience a deterioration in walking ability or bladder function			2
the operation has been available at @entity91 in @entity69 - just 12 miles away from @entity9 's home - since last may			2
consultant neurosurgeon @entity88 has since performed the operation on 12 patients at the hospital and recommended it for @entity74 two years ago			1
a further 14 children have been assessed by mr @entity88 and had funding for the operation refused by their local @entity26			0
@entity6 @entity69 's exceptional funding panel considered @entity9 's request for the surgery but refused it in december last year			0
the trust said they : ' had not been supplied with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that miss @entity9 has the potential to benefit over and above other patients with a similar condition for whom this treatment is also not currently available			0
' it is estimated that 1 in every 400 children in the @entity18 is affected by cerebral palsy and 1,800 babies are diagnosed with the condition each year .			1

@entity74 suffers from cerebral palsy and can only shuffle using a walking frame
she will undergo a procedure to ' free ' her legs thanks to contributions from well - wishers after her story was featured on @entity35 in january
