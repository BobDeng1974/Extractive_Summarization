the tastefully - executed event involves a group of beautiful women reading aloud various books , poems and novels - only paper form allowed - in the nude			1
after starting out in @entity16 , @entity15 franchises have made their way around the world , finally reaching the @entity3 in 2011			0
the event involves a group of women reading aloud from themed books , poems and novels , entirely in the nude for a small fee listeners get to relax , absorb the story and even join in with discussions mid-reading - but they 're not required to join in and remove their clothes ! @entity28 naked girl @entity29 , who has been running the @entity33 branch since its inception in march 2011 , tells us about naked story time			1
' i love picking an interesting theme and researching literature that ties in with the theme			0
i usually have one or two performers in addition to myself			0
i pick the pieces of literature that we read as a group and each performer picks three pieces of literature to read from individually			0

for a small fee listeners get to relax and absorb the story and even join in with discussions @entity73 ' my favourite themes so far have been @entity75 , banned books , @entity77 and @entity78 - this show combined readings and life drawing			1
' one of the highlights so far has been my friend @entity83 reading her own short stories at the @entity86 in 2013 , and unbeknownst to us , a literary agent was in the audience who signed @entity83 to write two novels			1
' naked @entity15 was founded in @entity16 by burlesque artist @entity90 and her partner @entity91			1
@entity92 spoke with the couple about producing a show in @entity33 and , after an interview process , was granted the @entity33 franchise			1

and ever since coming to the @entity3 , @entity101 's popularity has soared			0
' we have different theme for each show			1
i love producing and performing in it as it involves two things i appreciate - good literature and beautiful women			1
' the show has grown more and more popular , so much so as we 've had to change venues to accommodate our audience			2
' @entity92 , who also works as a burlesque artist and pin - up model , explains the readers ' beauty look			0
' we often style our hair and makeup in accordance with the theme			0
' for example , for the @entity145 show [ performer ] @entity147 and i wore dramatic , terrifying makeup			2
' for the @entity150 and @entity151 shows we wore our makeup in our usual style which is inspired by mid-century fashions , the 1930s , 40s and 50s - red lips , dark eyes and false eyelashes			0
' ' worldwide , performers style themselves appropriately to the theme of a show			2
' personally , i wear vintage clothing and makeup day - to - day , so i bring an element of this to the @entity168 shows			0
' for my burlesque acts , i love taking inspiration from glamourous , @entity172 @entity171 stars @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 and classic burlesque artists @entity169 , @entity179 and @entity180			0
' ( @entity181 ) @entity83 , @entity29 and @entity182 have a giggle during a reading @entity92 loves that they read paper books			0
@entity101 is an electronic reader - free zone ' the audience is made up of couples , groups of friends and a few people who come by themselves , ' she says			0
' we have audience members that come to each show - they must love the literature , as they 've already seen us naked ! with burlesque shows , the audience is roughly 70 per cent women , 30 per cent men			1
for @entity101 , it 's around 50 per cent women and 50 per cent men			2
' the most common comment i hear from audience members is that after the first 10 minutes they forget we are naked and get lost in the story			2
for the @entity145 show @entity147 and @entity92 wore @entity210 - style makeup ' people love being read to and many have n't experienced that since childhood			2
' it 's a fun show and discussions often occur with the audience between readings			2
during our banned books show , we asked the audience to guess why each book had been banned - our audience could not believe that @entity223 was banned due to sexual inferences and references to drugs ! ' one of the funniest times was when i was reading a book of scary urban legends at our scary stories show - the legends were so ridiculous , i could n't stop laughing and the audience had the giggles too			2
our fans often write in requesting themes which we take on board			0
and no , the audience are not naked , only the performers are			2
