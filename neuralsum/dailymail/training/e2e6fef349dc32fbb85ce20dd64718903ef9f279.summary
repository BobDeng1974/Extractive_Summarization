by @entity0 a woman is so allergic to the sun that she has been forced to wear a full - length dress and a hijab every time she goes outside			1
@entity6 , 40 , from @entity7 , now wears the attire each time she goes outside , to protect herself from a severe allergic reaction			1
the mother - of - four suffers from a condition known as polymorphic light eruption ( @entity13 ) which causes her skin to break out in an itchy red rash after just a few minutes of sun exposure			1
@entity6 , 40 , has polymorphic light eruption which means she develops an itch red rash if her skin is exposed to direct sunlight			1
she wears a hijab every time she goes out in order to protect herself however , ms @entity6 has found that donning a full - length dress called an ' abaya ' and a hijab has been the answer to her problems , and allows her to carry on with normal life			1
she said : ‘ when i first got @entity13 i tried applying sun creams and wearing sun hats but nothing seemed to work			2
‘ the rash was unbearable and it got to the point that i was avoiding going out			0
‘ the hijab and abaya is the only thing that provides any real protection from the sun and i actually really enjoy wearing it now			1
‘ i was self - conscious to begin with , but i had a lot of encouragement from friends , and i actually find it quite liberating			0
‘ i ’ve had some racist comments a few times but to be honest i do n’t really care what a racist thinks of me			0
’ she says that when the rash ( pictured ) first appeared she did not know what it was so called an out - of - hours doctor who said that it could be a sun allergy ms @entity6 tried wearing suncream and hats to protect herself from the sun but this did not stop her suffering a reaction			1
she also looked at clothes designed for people with allergies but they were very expensive the rash became so uncomfortable that she started to avoid going outside so as to prevent herself suffering a reaction ms @entity6 first noticed the rash after a long day outside in the sun. she said : ‘ i ’d been outside all day in a summer dress that exposed my neck , legs and arms			1
‘ i went back inside and i suddenly noticed i was getting itchy , and then a lumpy pink rash appeared			2
‘ i had no idea what was going on so i rang the out - of - hours doctor who said it sounded like i ’d developed a sun allergy			1
‘ i ’d heard of sun allergies before but i was still really shocked			2
it came out of nowhere			0
she realised that wearing a hijab ( left ) would cover her skin sufficiently to prevent her suffering an allergic reaction and found that she could buy them cheaply in charity shops			1
she is pictured ( right ) before the allergy ms @entity6 says that the main problem she races is racist comments from other people when she is out in her hijab			1
however , she says that she is happy with the decision she made ‘ i did some research and diagnosed myself with polymorphic light eruption			1
‘ the rash is incredibly itchy - that ’s the first thing you notice - and when you scratch your skin it really hurts			1
it feels like you ’ve been stung by stinging nettles			0
’ @entity13 is a skin rash that occurs when a person is exposed to sunlight			1
it is not harmful but it can be very itchy			0
it most often occurs in the spring or when a sufferer is on holiday because their skin is not used to the sun. the rash tends to be short - lived and disappears completely within about a week if the person stays out of the sun. @entity13 mostly affects people aged between 20 and 40 and is most common in women and people with fair skin			1
the rash can be caused by ultraviolet light or by visible light			2
visible light can pass through glass so a reaction can occur to sunlight through a window			2
treatment involves staying out of the sun and wearing protective clothing			2
light therapy which involves gradually exposing the skin to increasing amounts of uv light can also help			2
as a result of her research , ms @entity6 realised that covering up completely was her only option			1
she said : ‘ at first i was so worried because i did n’t know how to cope with the condition			0
‘ it was very scary and trying to find clothes that were suitable was very difficult			0
they ’d either be too expensive or expose too much skin			2
‘ i ended up looking a bit of a state - wearing long dresses with a jumper with the hood up			2
‘ but then i started looking online at allergy clothing and noticed that most of the outfits looked just like hijabs			2
‘ it became obvious to me that this was what i needed to wear to stay safe , but rather than buy expensive outfits on the internet , i just went to charity shops and brought second hand hijabs and head scarfs			0
‘ now i just wear my ordinary clothes , with an abaya over the top and then a head scarf			0
‘ it just feels the same as putting a coat on			0
‘ i do miss wearing pretty dresses and i used to love dressing up , but i can still wear all my old clothes when the sun goes down			0
’ the biggest challenge ms @entity6 says she has faced since her wardrobe change is the reaction of others to her unusual outfit choice			1
she said : ‘ people immediately assume i ’m @entity167			0
i do n’t mind that but i find the racist comments just disgusting			0
ms @entity6 says that she misses going out in pretty dresses but that she can wear them inside and in the evenings , after the sun has gone down ‘ i ’ve been called a race traitor and it ’s really opened my eyes to the kind of daily racism @entity167 have to put up with			1
‘ all my @entity167 friends have been so supportive of me wearing this , so it really upsets me			0
‘ i was genuinely shocked by the fear and hatred that people seem to have			0
’ ms @entity6 now carries on with normal life , wearing a hijab when the sun is out			1
she said : ‘ i ’m really happy with the decision i made			0
before she developed the allergy ( pictured ) she was able to sit out in the sun without suffering a reaction			2
she realised that the allergy had developed when she suddenly got a rash after spending a day outside ‘ wearing a hijab means i can get one with my daily life and i do n’t have to worry about my skin			1
‘ i feel confident and it ’s made me a more understanding person			0
‘ i can only hope that people might read this and take the same decision that i have			0
you do n’t need to spend lots of money on special clothing or the latest medicines			0
‘ you just need to take practical steps to cover yourself up			0

@entity6 has an allergy to sunlight called polymorphic light eruption
if her skin is exposed to the sun it comes out in an itchy , red rash
ms @entity6 tried wearing suncream and a sun hat but it did *n't* help
looked at outfits designed for those with allergies but they were expensive
discovered that covering up with a full - length dress called an ' abaya ' and a hijab prevented the allergic reaction
