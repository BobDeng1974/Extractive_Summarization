we ’ve all done it			0
it ’s the week before that much - needed holiday in the sun , but the last few days of work prove so busy that we do n’t get all those little pre-travel jobs ticked off			0
including that most crucial of tasks – buying the relevant overseas currency			0
wrong hands ? a new survey has criticised the poor exchange rates offered by airport vendors and so we end up using the foreign money booths at the airport – and , according to a new study , pay a heavy price for our failure to plan ahead			1
research conducted by the @entity20 has underlined the poor exchange rates offered by currency vendors at many @entity24 airports – and the impact this has on consumers , with travellers reportedly wasting £ 21million each year by buying holiday cash this way			1
the calculations are based on 1.63million tourists using airport money - changers – rather than high - street operators , which tend to offer better exchange rates			0
the figures also show that two thirds of people who buy currency at @entity24 airports are heading for the @entity41 – and that a sample conversion of £ 268 into euros leads to a loss of £ 12.56 when placed against non-airport cash vendors			1
according to the survey , the euro is the currency on which the most money is wasted			2
but conversions of sterling into dollars also prove costly , with £ 1.16million being lost annually on purchases of @entity53 money at the airport – around £ 12 each time			2
fewer people buy @entity57 or @entity58 dollars at the airport – but the rate of waste is even higher with these currencies , at £ 18.64 and £ 18.43 per transaction respectively			0
take care of the cents : £ 21million is reportedly ' wasted ' every year by tourists using @entity24 airport vendors the survey also names and shames @entity24 airports where vendor exchange rates are especially uncompetitive , with @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 attracting criticism			1
‘ we compared rates for ten currencies at 11 @entity24 airports with those available at @entity20 branches , and found that tourists buying at the airport would get less foreign cash for their pounds , ’ says @entity76 of @entity77			1
‘ families changing the average value transaction of £ 268 into euros at the airport face lose almost £ 13 – enough to buy a snack lunch for four in the @entity92 ’			0

new survey shows the poor rates offered by airport currency exchanges
around £ 21million million is ' wasted ' at @entity24 airports every year
@entity99 is the currency on which most cash is ' lost ' , followed by @entity53 dollars
