by @entity0 after 38 games of a long , hard season , the best side always wins the title and @entity5 thoroughly deserve their success			1
@entity7 has done a fantastic job in his first season in @entity11 football and he and @entity5 should be congratulated			1
after the match i was talking to @entity14 and we agreed that if we were to have our careers again in the present day then we , and any current young player , would want to join @entity5			1
that is the club where you want to be			0
@entity20 have dominated @entity11 football for so long and though @entity5 might not have the history , they have the future			2
the champions : @entity24 holds up the trophy as @entity5 win the @entity26 they have spent big money but they are building now with a manager who has the respect and gratitude of his players and are always looking forward			1
with @entity32 working with the youth sides , too , they are clearly trying to copy the @entity35 model of having an entire club following one football philosophy			0
it has served them well this season , but they will want to make a much better defence of their title than they did after winning it 2011 - 12			2
that will not be easy			0
make no mistake , the big clubs are coming for @entity5			2
@entity20 will not want a repeat of this season , @entity51 will be desperate to get @entity54 winning trophies , @entity50 will challenge again and if @entity56 can keep @entity57 they will be right up there			1
if those five are fighting it out at the top , we could be in for another special season			0
happy man : @entity7 has done a fantastic job in his first season in charge at @entity5 reliable @entity68 the number of times the lead at the top of the @entity26 has changed hands this season			1
@entity68 gave @entity50 a reminder of what they have been missing with his goal at @entity78 on sunday			1
he has taken his game to the next level and i almost picked him in my team of the year			0
@entity68 was the best player in the league until his injury and that was a real blow for @entity50 because he is a complete midfielder — he can tackle , pass , assist and score			1
and , as the stats below show , @entity50 were much better off when their @entity92 wizard was on the pitch this season			1
who 's the man ? @entity50 's @entity68 celebrates after scoring against @entity78 on sunday we could be saying farewell to some good managers this summer but clubs should be careful what they wish for			1
@entity101 need to be a @entity26 club when they move into the @entity103 and though the football was n’t pretty , @entity104 has done well to keep them up			0
at @entity107 , i ’m not sure what the future holds for @entity110 but he has done a good job in difficult circumstances			1
he knows he still has a lot to learn but he has done more than enough to get another good job			1
more to come : @entity107 interim manager @entity110 acknowledges the supporters was this the best season ever ? in terms of the excitement , the goals , the twists and the turns , i do n’t think i have seen a better @entity26 season			1
it may not have the same passing or technical quality as the @entity35 league , but from top to bottom , nothing beats the pure , raw excitement of the @entity26			0
where else would you find a game and an atmosphere like there was at @entity137 on monday night , or at @entity138 when @entity56 beat @entity5 ? those two games more than any other this season epitomised everything we love about our league — goals , passion and great drama			2
drama : @entity57 was left gutted after @entity149 fought back for a 3 - 3 draw with @entity56 last monday that game at @entity138 was a personal favourite and was one of the undoubted higlights of the @entity155 and @entity57 had their own personal battle to win goal of the season , but i think @entity57 ’s flick up and volley against @entity78 was the best individual goal while @entity162 ’s , also against @entity78 , was the best team effort			0
it has been magnificent viewing , so let ’s hope for more of the same after a great @entity166			0
happier times : @entity57 's flick up and volley against @entity78 was the best individual goal of the season @entity170 he did n’t quite make it into my team of the season , but there is no doubt about my young player of the year			1
@entity178 has been superb and i have loved watching him tear through midfields up and down the country			0
talent : @entity182 's 20 - year - old @entity178 has been superb throughout the season he is unique in the @entity11 game because we do n’t have another young player who can carry the ball so far and at such speed and still look comfortable with both feet			1
let ’s hope he gets the @entity166 call today that his performances so richly deserve			0
13,929,810 the total gate in the @entity26 this season , up 275,902 from last season			2
@entity20 ’s home game against @entity195 at @entity196 drew the biggest crowd — 75,368			0
2nd @entity198 are only the second side in @entity26 history to stay up after being bottom at @entity202			0
they secured their survival with a win over @entity206 , who did it in 2004 - 05			0
4 @entity209 scored his fourth own goal of the season against @entity212 , a new @entity26 record			2
@entity56 and @entity198 were the league ’s top own goal scorers this season with six each			0
oops : @entity209 holds a new @entity26 record after scoring his fourth own goal of the season 1,052 goals this season , the lowest @entity26 total since 2008 - 09			2
@entity5 hit the most with 102 , just one shy of @entity54 ’s @entity26 record , but @entity78 scored just 28 , the third - worst tally in @entity26 history			1
64 @entity20 ’s 64 points is their lowest total in the @entity26			0
their previous worst was 75 in 1996 - 97 and 2003 - 04			0
31 @entity227 played the first 3,389 minutes of @entity26 football for @entity149 before being subbed off for the final 31 against @entity229			0
ever present : @entity149 's @entity227 ( left ) almost played every minute of the @entity26 season 1961 this is the first time since 1961 that more than one team have scored 100 top - flight goals			1
10 this is the first time 10 managers have left their clubs in a single @entity26 season .			2

@entity5 thoroughly deserve their @entity26 title success
city manager @entity7 has done a fantastic job in his first season in charge at the @entity244
@entity50 were much better off when @entity68 was on the pitch this season
@entity110 has done a good job in difficult circumstances at @entity107
@entity182 's @entity178 is my young player of the year
