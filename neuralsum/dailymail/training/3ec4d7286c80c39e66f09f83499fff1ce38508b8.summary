the antique bear , which has one eye and a floppy ear , was found last year in a bag with a frayed black and white photo , dated march 1918 , of him being cuddled by two little girls			1
unlike @entity21 , the toy had no name tag but a message in faded ink on the back of the picture read : ' with dearest love and kisses to our darling @entity30 from your loving little daughters @entity33 and @entity34			2
' staff at @entity5 made a public appeal to try and trace the owner earlier this year and have now identified ‘ @entity30 ’ as @entity8			1

but despite identifying the family airport staff are yet to trace any living relatives and are appealing for anyone who knows the @entity8 family to come forward			1
@entity53 , airport spokeswoman , said : ' we gained a lot of interest once we went out with the story we had found the bear			2
' we had bear historians , photographic historians and ancestral forums come forward to help			2
the bear was found last year in a bag with a frayed black and white photo , dated march 1918 , of him being cuddled by two little girls ' using all the information we had we managed to identify the family in the photograph and trace " @entity30 " as @entity8			1
' the only problem we have is that we have not had any living relatives come forward to claim the bear			0
' we would love to find them and reunite them with this lovely bear			0
' staff at @entity5 spent 14 months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names as those mentioned on the back of the picture			1
when they could not , they appealed for help from the public and a number of experts stepped forward to help with the search			0
they were able to trace the date of the picture after they discovered a second message on the image , which said : ' taken on @entity93 ’s birthday march 4th 1918 , one year and five - months - old			2
' a message in faded ink on the back of the picture ( left ) read : ' with dearest love and kisses to our darling @entity30 from your loving little daughters @entity33 and @entity34 '			0

despite identifying the family , airport staff are yet to trace any living relatives and are appealing for anyone who knows the @entity8 family to come forward ' we honestly , genuinely believed somebody would come forward and claim him			1
