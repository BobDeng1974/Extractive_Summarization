but inventors in @entity8 have gone one better - developing a tiny car that can automatically take passengers from a to b without them having to do a thing			0
@entity8 tech conglomerate @entity12 today revealed its new robot for @entity14 ( @entity15 , for short ) in the city of @entity17 in the @entity18			1
mini motors : @entity21 's @entity20 , allegedly the world 's smallest car unveiled on @entity5 last month ( left ) , and the new robot for @entity14 revealed by @entity8 firm @entity12 ( right ) no licence needed : the one man mobility robot can pick - up and drop off a passenger autonomously no need to move : @entity21 designed the @entity20 himself and tested the vehicle on the streets of @entity31 the one man mobility robot can pick - up and drop off a passenger autonomously , while , in emergencies , passengers can seize control of the vehicle using a joystick controller in the cockpit			1
originally developed to help those who have difficulty walking - an increasing number of people in @entity8 's ageing society - @entity44 is designed to be small enough to move through pedestrian spaces			0
@entity21 unveiled the @entity20 , designed by the presenter himself , in february on the first episode of @entity5 's most recent series			1
@entity21 tested the four - wheel vehicle on the streets of @entity31 , hitting 34mph at one stage as he weaved around traffic in the tiny vehicle			0
look ma , no hands ! but passengers can seize control of the vehicle using a joystick in an emergency tomorrow 's world : @entity62 , single - user public transport has long been predicted for the future looking uncomfortable within the car 's miniscule frame , @entity21 said : ' i ’m just staggered that @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , all of the automotive giants have n’t thought to make a car like this yet			1
' the @entity8 robot is equipped with @entity75 to allow it to find its way , as well as laser distance sensors to look out for obstacles and a gyro sensor to help it stay upright while negotiating uneven ground			2
passengers need only specify their desired destination on a touch - screen map and the machine will automatically drive them there			0
similarly , anyone who needs a ride will be able to call a @entity44 vehicle from any number of computer - networked ' stops ' dotted around the city			0
the vehicle is also equipped with ' active suspension ' which controls each wheel individually to enable it to tackle curbs and uneven ground while keeping passengers comfortably upright			0
squeezed in : @entity21 hit a top speed of 34mph in the vehicle and was pictured overtaking static traffic , despite looking slightly uncomfortable lightweight : passengers enter the @entity44 vehicle by means of a front hatch unruffled : the system could be the perfect answer for @entity8 's busy corporate class of ' salary men '			2
