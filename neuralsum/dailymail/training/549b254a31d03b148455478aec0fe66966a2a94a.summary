by @entity1 reporter published : 11:18 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 15:43 est , 5 july 2012 police had to launch a desperate late - night rescue operation in @entity4 after a section of highway collapsed into a giant sinkhole , trapping a car and killing at least one passenger			1
the cavernous hole appeared along a busy stretch of @entity12 in @entity13 , the capital of @entity14 , central @entity4 , early this morning			1
the 30m - square pit swallowed a passing car , and at least one person died at the scene before emergency services could haul anyone to safety			1
the cave - in site was close to the @entity48 , a major tributary of the @entity50 , @entity4 's longest waterway			1
one rescuer with the local fire brigade described the sinkhole as being so deep , ' we can not see the bottom of the pit with the naked eye '			1
local police closed the road off as crowds gathered , with investigators trying to establish what caused the road to collapse			2
a sinkhole is a natural depression in the @entity67 's surface which can be formed gradually or suddenly and occur worldwide			2
they can vary in size , from 1 to 600 meters both in depth and diameter and form when the foundation below the surface layer dissolves			2
this commonly occurs when the rock below is dissolved by ground water			2
@entity78 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity67 usually stays intact			0
according to the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 are the states most affected by sinkholes			0
while they often occur from natural causes , sinkholes can be man - made and caused by human activity			1
groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits			0
last month , residents in @entity83 , @entity99 , looked on in horror as a 40ft wide hole opened up in their street			1
it completely swallowed up the rear of this house in @entity106 , @entity107			0
the house collapsed into the ground like a toy house with its contents spilling everywhere			0
the owner of the home was an elderly woman whose husband died a few years ago			0
she lived at the property on her own but was fortunately not at the house when the incident happened .			0

witnesses say @entity44 with three passengers fell into 30m - wide hole early on thursday morning
