a new season offers players a fresh start , a chance to banish a nightmare campaign from the previous year or show the world that they are not just a flash in the pan			1
it ’s time to rescue careers and build some others			1
@entity11 ( @entity12 ) both @entity11 and @entity13 have a point to prove , but after all the trophies @entity13 has won i would say the pressure is on @entity11			1
he has done everything he can on loan but now he has to prove he is the present and future			1
one slip and @entity13 will be breathing down his neck			1
he has had injury problems but his game has not developed as quickly as he ’d have liked and he needs to improve defensively			2
improvements : @entity33 's @entity32 still has to work on his defensive play @entity25 ( @entity42 ) he arrived as the next @entity43 but he has not lived up to that billing so far			2
it does n’t help that his role in the team is undefined and injuries have hindered his progress , but if manager @entity24 shows belief in him as a pure centre back , he can prosper			2
belief : @entity42 defender @entity25 could prosper with a run at centre back test : defender @entity55 has failed to build on an impressive start at @entity42 @entity55 ( @entity42 ) similar to @entity25 , @entity55 has not pushed on as he might have hoped			2
their lack of development left @entity36 with a gaping defensive hole at the @entity60 — they were not ready			2
but @entity61 improved @entity63 ’s defence and he can do the same with @entity55			2
@entity64 ( @entity65 ) a lot has been said about the young @entity64 but now he has to live up to the hype			2
his loan move to @entity69 did n’t really work last season but you have to admire him for turning down @entity72 for the chance to play regularly at @entity65			0
if he does n’t , shine , he ’ll be back in the @entity74			0
@entity75 ( @entity76 ) he was impressive at @entity77 last year but it takes a brave man to cross the wear to @entity76 , especially on a free			0
@entity80 faced bitter abuse when he joined @entity82 from @entity33 , let ’s hope @entity75 does not suffer as much			1
the only way to keep people quiet is to play well			0
big opportunity : midfielder @entity87 can finally fulfill his potential at @entity77 @entity87 ( @entity77 ) he has been considered a hot prospect for too long and now he has a chance to prove his worth			1
his career stalled when he left @entity93 for @entity94 , so with regular football this season he can show us his undoubted talent			0
he needs to lose his reputation of being injury - prone			0
@entity99 ( @entity100 ) his homecoming at @entity102 never really went to plan , so much so his boyhood club were happy to release him in the summer			0
now at @entity100 , he has to show he ’s still got the ability that once made him one of the most exciting @entity106 midfielders of his generation			0
ability : veteran @entity99 still has the talent to light up the @entity110 @entity111 ( @entity112 ) when you spend the summer sulking because you ca n’t move clubs , you have to prove you are worth the hassle			1
whether he stays at @entity112 or gets his move to @entity33 , @entity111 needs to knuckle down and forget about all of this			0
@entity120 ( @entity82 ) the biggest problem for @entity75 has been staying fit			1
he takes the game to the opposition and to do that you need to be in supreme condition			0
because he ’s so talented he ’s been able to get by but after a good pre-season , now he can show that explosive pace again			1
point to prove : @entity82 midfielder @entity120 has to rediscover his explosive pace challenge : @entity131 striker @entity130 now has to show he can lead the line without @entity133 focus : @entity131 boss @entity135 must build on second place finish last season @entity130 ( @entity131 ) after the season he had last time out , you might not think he has much to prove			1
but now he has to show he can lead the line without @entity133			1
there ’s no doubting his ability but he needs to become @entity131 ’s @entity145 goalscorer , mr @entity144			1
@entity135 ( @entity131 , manager ) @entity135 said last year it was n’t just about @entity133 , it was about a team — now he has to prove it			1
he plays to win and always encourages his teams to attack			0
i enjoy watching his sides go forward but he needs to show last season was not a one - off			0
@entity154 ( @entity100 , asst manager ) it ’s back to the day - to - day life of football now for @entity154 and it will be fascinating to see how he gets on , particularly with @entity160			0
he ’s not making decisions , so it will be a new perspective and he really needs a positive experience in club management after some failures			0
upheaval : @entity111 must knuckle down at @entity112 ... or @entity33 big call : @entity64 made a bold decision to snub @entity72 and sign for @entity65 perspective : new @entity100 no 2 @entity154 needs to make a positive impact tackle @entity172			0

@entity12 keeper @entity11 now he has to prove he is the present and future
@entity82 midfielder @entity120 has to stay fit and rediscover his explosive pace
@entity131 striker @entity130 must step up after departure of @entity133
