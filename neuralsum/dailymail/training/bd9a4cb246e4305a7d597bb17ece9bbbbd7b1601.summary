a grandmother was needlessly killed by a rare flesh - eating bug after blundering @entity5 medics failed to diagnose and operate in time , the @entity0 has heard			1
@entity6 , 60 , died only three days after contracting necrotising fasciitis when she slipped on snow in her driveway and cut her arm			1
the infection moved up her arms and into her chest , killing her at christmas 2010			2
but the popular receptionist 's death could have been avoided if hospital staff had examined her sooner and amputated her arms in time , her family say			2
@entity6 ( pictured , left , on her 60th birthday and , right , with her grandson @entity19 ) died after she contracted a rare flesh - eating bug			1
her widower , @entity22 , is now suing an @entity5 trust for negligence despite being in excruciating pain , she was not deemed a top priority when she went to @entity28 and , by the time she was diagnosed , it was too late			1
her widower , @entity22 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , is now suing the @entity5 over what he says was the needless death of his wife of 40 years			1
given the choice of life or death , the devoted grandmother - of - six would have had no problem agreeing to a double amputation if that had been offered earlier , he said			2
he said : ' she loved life			0
her pride and joy were all her children and grandchildren			0
she never walked away from problems			0
' mrs @entity6 , pictured with her grandson @entity47 , was left in agony after the fall on her driveway mrs @entity6 cut her elbow when she fell in 2010 , but she put the pain and chills she felt the following day down to a flare - up of arthritis or a cold			1
two days later , weeping blisters had begun to develop on her hands and arms and the excruciating pain became too much to bear			2
she went to @entity28 at @entity61 , but despite her presentation , she was not considered a top priority			1
delays in examination and diagnosis meant the decision to amputate did not come until the morning of the third day after her fall and even then there was an almost two - hour wait before the operation began			1
mr @entity72 had time only to wish her good luck and give her a kiss before she was taken away to have her arms amputated			0
but tragically , the bug had already travelled up past her shoulder , killing vital tissue in her arm and chest			2
the operation was aborted and mrs @entity6 , who was a receptionist in the village gp 's surgery , died that afternoon			1
the family 's barrister , @entity84 , said the @entity61 was negligent in not making her a higher priority case			2
casualty staff should have spotted her intense and unremitting pain and had her clinically assessed sooner , he told the judge , sir @entity89			0
such ' severe , significant , unvarying , excruciating pain ' – out of proportion with any visible symptoms – is the hallmark of necrotising fasciitis , the court was told			1
infection expert prof @entity96 criticised the delay in preparing mrs @entity6 for , and getting her to , surgery			1
mrs @entity6 was taken to @entity28 at @entity61 in 2010 but not treated as a top priority had she been diagnosed and operated on earlier , her life would probably have been saved , he said			1
he told the court : ' there was no reason to delay - time costs lives			0
necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs			0
it can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister			0
the earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain , which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection			1
as it progresses , fever , diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious			0
the skin typically turns a dark violet colour , blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die			0
without treatment to remove the affected tissue , the bug will spread rapidly and can result in death			0
' in the face of necrotising fasciitis is no place for the faint - hearted , because you have to be decisive in your actions and very aggressive in your management			0
' you would explain the life threatening nature of the condition and that time is of the essence			0
' you have two choices : you either do n't operate , in which case the outcome is inevitable , or you operate immediately , giving the best chance			0
' in his career , he had never come across a patient who chose to die when given the option of amputation , he told the court			0
although its barrister , @entity157 , apologised to the family for ' failures and delays ' in @entity28 , the @entity61 denies liability for mrs @entity6 's death			1
she presented at the hospital with only ' moderate ' pain and so was given the correct priority status , it asserts			2

@entity6 , 60 , slipped and fell on snow on her driveway in 2010
she suffered severe pain in arm and later went to @entity28 at local hospital
despite being in agony , she was not *categorised* as top priority
the decision meant ' delays ' to surgery and she died three days after fall
her widower , @entity22 , is now suing @entity5 over her ' needless death '
@entity5 trust denies liability for her death and case is now in court
