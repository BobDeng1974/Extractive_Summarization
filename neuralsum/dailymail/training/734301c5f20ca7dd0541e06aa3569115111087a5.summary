tell him if he does it again i ’ll deck him			2
’ ' @entity14 ' : @entity3 used the term in a row with @entity2 mp @entity26 , but sources close to the @entity29 said he was referring to @entity9 president @entity30 , and not the @entity18 mp sources close to mr @entity3 – who wanted @entity31 to take military action against the @entity9 regime – confirmed he used the term ‘ @entity14 ’ in the confrontation with mr @entity10 after the 10.30pm vote on thursday			1
and they said mr @entity3 also told him : ‘ you will have to live with this on your conscience			1
’ but they insisted the cabinet minister was referring to @entity9 president @entity30 as a ‘ @entity14 ’ and was not comparing mr @entity10 to the @entity43			1
mr @entity3 ’s friends said he had nothing to apologise for			1

but sources close to mr @entity10 hit back			2
‘ @entity3 lost his rag , ’ said one			1
‘ everyone knows “ @entity14 ” means @entity43			0
it was meant as an insult and @entity10 was right to be outraged			0

‘ he told @entity63 , including @entity10 , they were a disgrace and were giving succour to @entity30 , who was a @entity14			1
@entity10 said “ what did you just say to me ? ” he was very cross and said , “ say that again and i ’ll thump you			0
” ‘ but it was a misunderstanding			0
@entity3 was calling @entity30 a @entity72 was still angry later on when i talked to him in the @entity73 ’ smoking room to try to sort it out			1
we ended up having a civilised conversation about whether or not @entity30 was a @entity14			1
’ it was not the only bad - tempered exchange involving mr @entity3			1
he told @entity79 spokesman @entity78 : ‘ you are appeasing @entity30			2
’ @entity81 mr @entity78 shouted back : ‘ f * * * off you bully			0
you ’re angry because you lost			0
’ the ‘ appeasement ’ jibe also has toxic echoes of @entity17			0
it was the damning charge levelled at those who tried to do a deal with the @entity6 leader in an attempt to avoid war			0
mr @entity13 was also involved in heated exchanges with @entity2 leader @entity92 , accusing him of political treachery and ratting on a pledge to support him over air strikes against @entity9			2
on the eve of @entity8 vote , when mr @entity92 told the prime minister he would not back him , mr @entity13 accused him of betraying @entity100 and siding with @entity30 ’s @entity102 allies			2
‘ you are going against our greatest ally and siding with @entity103 ! ’ shouted mr @entity13 , referring to @entity102 defence minister @entity103			0
mr @entity92 said : ‘ this is getting us nowhere ’ – and slammed the phone down			0
shortly after the @entity8 defeat inflicted by @entity63 and @entity58 rebels , a seething mr @entity13 told a colleague : ‘ i understand those who voted against me for sincere reasons of principle , but @entity92 is just playing politics			1
he put his party before his country			0
’ a source close to mr @entity13 said : ‘ @entity92 ’s behaviour was disgusting			0
he ignored the interests of his nation to score a cheap party political success			0
’ ' you 've put your party before your country : prime minister @entity13 , left , accused @entity2 leader @entity92 of ignoring @entity31 interests to score a ' cheap ' political point by opposing attacks on @entity9 @entity130 ’s son mr @entity10 , 63 , is proud of his radical @entity18 roots , claiming he is ‘ independent enough to fight a corner when needs be ’			1

it has its roots in the 17th century @entity175 tradition of military discipline			0
@entity17 used it to justify the @entity178			0
there are some parallels with @entity17 : @entity30 runs a totalitarian state enforced by a slavishly loyal military and secret police who routinely torture , imprison and kill his political opponents			2
