by @entity0 @entity1 erupted this week spewing plumes of volcanic ash that disrupted flights into and out of the @entity6 city of @entity7			1
the eruption , which began on sunday , was n’t serious enough to trigger an evacuation of the mountain villages nearby			1
it did , however , cause a temporary closure of two air space corridors in @entity7 - the busiest airport on @entity15 and one of the most frequently used within @entity6			1
@entity1 has erupted spewing plumes of volcanic ash that disrupted flights into and out of the @entity6 city of @entity7			1
the eruption , which began on sunday , was n’t serious enough to trigger an evacuation of the mountain villages nearby the stunning pyrotechnic display was the first of the year , with much of the activity coming from a region in the south - east side of the volcano			1
the latest update from @entity28 says : ' there are no significant variations in activity have occurred during the past days			2
small lava flows are being fed by the new fissure vent at the eastern base of the @entity36 crater			0
' @entity1 stands almost 11,000ft ( 3.4km ) above sea level , looming over the whole @entity6 island of @entity15			1
it has been active for thousands of years , although its first eruption of modern times was thought to be in 475 bc. it is so well - known it was written about by the @entity45 poet @entity44 , who called its eruptions a ' roar of frightful rain '			1

effectively a weather radar for ash , the avoid system has been supported by @entity77 and should reduce the chances of a repeat of the @entity85 volcanic ash - cloud crisis of spring 2010			2
created by dr @entity86 of @entity87 , the system utilises infra - red technology fitted to aircraft to supply images to pilots			2
this will enable themto see an ash cloud up to 60 miles ahead of the aircraft and at altitudes between 5,000ft and 50,000ft , to help avoid ash clouds			0
eruptions are rarely dangerous , but they can kill			0
@entity1 's most deadly moment came in 1669 , when a series of blasts killed 20,000 people and destroyed the town of @entity7			1
but farmers stayed in the area because the constant eruptions made the ground fertile			0
in 1992 , @entity1 posed another serious threat when lava streams headed towards @entity110 , a town of 7,000 people			0
in a spectacular operation , @entity6 and @entity114 soldiers used controlled explosions to divert the flow			0
@entity1 's blasts are known as @entity120 eruptions - caused when gas bubbles in molten magma accumulate underground and rise to the surface			2
these pockets of molten earth then burst in a fiery show , sending plumes of lava and ash hundreds of feet into the air			2
volcanic ash clouds can pose problems for aircraft			0
the immense ash clouds that erupted from @entity85 ’s @entity136 volcano in 2010 caused chaos for the airline industry			2
no one really knew if it would be safe to fly , and technology to accurately detect the plumes of ash had yet to be developed			0
since then , a number of ash detection systems have been created to make flying around volcanic sites safer			0
