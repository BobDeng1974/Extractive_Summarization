by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 28 february 2013 @entity2 : 09:32 est , 28 february 2013 a determined @entity4 evangelist has demonstrated his devotion to his faith by carrying a huge cross for thousands of miles across the globe for the past 26 years			1
@entity9 , 60 , has trekked through 19 countries including @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 during his remarkable journey			1
and despite being thrown out of @entity16 , in @entity17 , being shot at in @entity18 and attacked by angry zealots , he remains resolute and has no plans to give up on his mission			1
determined : christian evangelist @entity9 carries his cross through @entity23 , @entity24 as he makes his pilgrimage around the world trek : mr @entity27 carrying his cross through @entity13			1
he has so far trekked through 19 countries around the world including @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 journey : mr @entity27 poses with his cross in @entity33			1
he first took up the 12ft 6in tall cross in 1987 and has spent only a handful of days without it exotic travels : among the regions he journeyed through was @entity40 ( pictured )			1
his next trip abroad will be to @entity43 father - of - two @entity9 said : ' there is a reaction from people straight away , you end up talking and connecting to people you would n't normally talk to			1
' people start opening up about their own lives and you end up sharing with them something that is most personal			2
' i find people often want to talk , but if people do n't want to know i walk on			2
the love you get from it all is amazing , people will just stop and ask you questions , offer you food and sometimes a place to stay			2
challenge : he is seen here carrying the cross in @entity66 , east @entity67 during the earlier stages of his journey mr @entity27 carries the huge cross , which has a wheel at its base , over his shoulder for up to 12 hours a day , and often has no idea where he will sleep that night			1
but the part - time care worker , from @entity77 , @entity78 , admitted he has sometimes put his life at risk during his travels			1
he said : ' there is fear there sometimes because i have a wife and kids and you do n't want to put yourself in danger			2
it is really trusting in @entity92 , knowing he will protect you			2
' he first took up the 12ft by 6ft tall cedar wood cross in 1987 and has only spent a handful of weeks without it			2
mr @entity27 receives generous donations from supporters to help him stay on the road , but he stops to carry out carework in his home town in order to pay his family 's bills			0
' i tried giving up my full time work and doing this full time instead but i did n't get enough money to make ends meet , ' he added			0
mr @entity27 has spoken to thousands of curious people during his trek around the world and has shaken hands and prayed with many more			0
he often finds himself ministering to prostitutes or invited to brothels , and will regularly spend nights in bus shelters or basic accommodation with only a sleeping bag , and a hole in the floor for a toilet			0
even language barriers do not hold the preacher back and he regularly finds himself mobbed by hundreds of locals wanting to hear him speak			0
beginning : mr @entity27 smiles as he poses in front of his cross at the start of his travels around the world courage : he is confronted by police as he tries to carry the cross into @entity134 , @entity135 stamina : mr @entity27 in @entity137 , @entity78			1
the 60 - year - old has needed remarkable mental and physical strength to make his trek compassion : he stops to pray with a stranger as he journey 's around the world			1
mr @entity27 has helped many people in need during his travels he said : ' as you can expect in the @entity150 language is n't a problem			0
i walk into town centres and try and say hello to everyone i can but i realise that some people do n't want to talk			0
' you shake hands with people a lot and some ask you to pray with them			0
oddly some of the best conversations i have had have been at pubs where people are willing to sit down and give the time to talk to you			0
achievement : mr @entity27 carries his cross next to @entity16 , @entity17 - the headquarters of the @entity168 ' i can speak a bit of @entity171 and @entity172 but other than that it can be a bit of a problem			1
he said that when he visits countries where he can not speak the language he tries to write out a prayer in that language to show people			2
' often i will just pray in @entity179 anyway , ' he said			0
' sometimes you get people who translate for you , i had one young boy who came out of nowhere when i was talking to around 20 or 30 people and he just translated everything			0
' when it was done he just disappeared , i never knew who he was or where he came from , it 's amazing			0
' he is currently on the road in @entity190 , travelling from @entity191 , in @entity24 , to @entity192 , before heading south to @entity193 and finally onwards to see his wife and dog at home in @entity78			0
his next trip abroad will be to @entity43 in may , before he moves on to @entity198 after the rainy season has ended			0
