by @entity0 only the fortunate few get to walk away from sport on their own terms			1
even fewer do so with a freshly - minted gold medal as a souvenir from their final farewell			1
@entity8 admits he could n’t have staged his exit any better after confirming his retirement from judo this week in the wake of his heavyweight triumph at the @entity14			1
the @entity15 , 31 , has donned his robe and belt for the last time			1
but there will be plenty more fights to come			1
‘ i love a good scrap , ’ laughs the @entity21 columnist			1
’ returning to duty : @entity25 salutes after taking gold in @entity27 and will now return to the @entity28 except it will now come caked in mud and possibly in enemy territory with a full - time return to his day job as a @entity28			1
the decision was made a week ago			1
‘ i looked at all my options			1
i was looking at a silver medal i won at a @entity39 in @entity40			1
there ’s only five or six judokas in the @entity43 who have one of those medals and that was my second			1
it ’s an incredible achievement			1
' but i have to step back and take the sensible decision and that ’s to go home			1
’ where that is remains a destination unknown , to whichever foreign land he is required on his next tour of duty			1
@entity57 was a distraction and an outlet for his frustrations , an escape route from the demons of drink that threatened to dole his career a knockout blow			1
honour : the heavyweight judoka meets @entity70 first minister @entity69 as @entity71 celebrate it was never meant to take him so far away from criss - crossing the globe in the services of his country			1
‘ it ’s all i ’ve wanted to do since i was 17 , ’ @entity8 insists			1
‘ the @entity83 ’s given me so many opportunities			1
and i ’m very grateful for that			2
it ’s made me an @entity15			2
it ’s allowed me to go places			2
' it is hard to give up judo because i could have go on to @entity87 and got a medal			2
but what swung it is that i ’ve been based in @entity91 and there ’s not the level of coaching there i need to be at my very best			2
’ there ’s also self - interest here			2
while his sporting ranking has rarely been higher , his service standing has dropped off the charts			2
‘ currently , i ’ve got no rank , ’ he reveals			2
‘ it ’s only 10 years until i retire and my pension is based on my rank at that point so i need to work hard to improve that			2
i only did four and a half years before i got my sports draft so i ’ve a lot to make up for			2
’ duty calls : the @entity15 will have to return to service and improve his rank as he moves away from sport a course in coping with missions in the mountains is booked in			2
the training regime has already kicked off			2
thirteen kilos have been trimmed off since he left the mat in @entity27			0
‘ i was probably a little chubby there			0
and i ’ve another five to go before i can start running again and get out there with a rucksack on my back			0
’ that will come in the autumn			0
after nine years without a holiday , with a honeymoon still owed to wife @entity133 , the @entity130 - born @entity129 is under strict orders from his superiors to have a breather before he reports back			0
there are bookings for school visits in the meantime			0
but still plenty of gaps in the diary			0
the first mission on the slate is to get the message out about the power of sport and the benefits from fighting to reach one goal before targeting the next			0
‘ i want to be a role model , ’ he says			1
‘ i think i ’ve a duty to show these young kids that you can achieve huge things , even if you ’re someone like me who did n’t do that well at school			1
achievement : the sport allowed @entity8 to compete in front of a home crowd at @entity164 ' i look at footballers			1
they have such a great opportunity to be positive role models but for some reason , they do n’t do it			1
so if there ’s anyone who wants me to come and talk at their school , i ’ll be right there			0
’ some have already been inspired			0
@entity8 was coaxed on stage last week at a concert in @entity179 but was approached afterwards by four men who had watched him in action			1
all were ex-marines , all with the @entity183 on their cvs			0
‘ that was much tougher than anything i ’ve ever had , ’ he recounts			0
‘ and they told me they were proud of what i ’ve achieved			0
that was just a really emotional moment			0
' to get that applause from the crowd is one thing but to have it from them meant so much to me			0
’ it is an eternal brotherhood			0
@entity199 has strong bonds but nothing like those forged in the line of fire			0
but the memories of what he accomplished in his stints on the mat will follow him now wherever he goes			0
and he leaves the stage as a champion , a privilege afforded only to the lucky or the brave			0
in hindsight , he saved his best to last			0
‘ i was so focused on getting that fight right , ’ @entity8 smiles			1
‘ i knew if i did well , there ’d be some media attention but i never expected everything that happened			0
' same with the public			0
the home crowd was incredible			0
i know i ’ll never have something like that again			0
‘ but to finish the fight in the final the way i did was exactly what i wanted			0
i did my job perfectly			1
it was my time and it felt amazing			0

@entity8 won @entity229 at @entity230
having now retired he returns to his job as a @entity28
@entity8 says he wants to be a role model for young kids
