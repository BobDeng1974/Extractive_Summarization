by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 13 april 2012 headline acts performing at the opening and closing ceremonies of the @entity4 will sing over pre-recorded backing tracks			1
organisers have defended the move , claiming the @entity9 weather and the shape of the @entity11 mean it 's ' not possible for the music in all the shows to be live '			1
but it is likely to infuriate fans who have paid up to Â£ 2,000 to watch a star - studded line - up rumoured to include @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity19			0
can you hear me rocking ? : the @entity17 are among the acts expected to perform at the @entity4 acts like @entity18 will be forced to perform to backing tracks at opening and closing ceremonies the closing ceremony will be a celebration of @entity9 music ' from @entity31 to @entity19 ' who are you ? : veteran rockers the who are rumoured to be on the top secret line - up the line - ups for the opening ceremony on july 27 and the @entity4 ' farewell on august 12 are a closely guarded secret			1
but they are expected to feature a who 's who of @entity9 music			2
organisers have dubbed the shows a celebration of the best @entity9 has to offer , ' from @entity31 to @entity19			1
' and there are expected to be starring roles for rock veterans @entity17 and @entity20 , as well as @entity18			0
in february , creative director @entity49 insisted there would be an emphasis on live performance			0
he said : ' the intention is n't to go out there and do a mime show			0
' but organisers have been forced to concede all backing music will have to be laid down in the studio beforehand			2
plans for an all - live show were hampered by concerns about the unpredictability of the @entity9 weather , as well as technical issues with the shape and size of the @entity11 in @entity67			1
organisers want to create a surround sound effect , but the bowl shape of the venue meant they were left with microphone feedback during sound tests			2
a spokesman for organisers @entity76 insisted : ' due to the complexity involved , it 's just not possible for the music in all the shows to be live			0
there will be live musical elements , but many of the shows will be recorded in advance			0
this is standard procedure for an event of this scale			0
' despite this , the decision to use backing tracks has been dubbed ' shameful ' by @entity91 , the assistant general secretary of the @entity92			1
mr @entity91 told the @entity93 : ' coming from the @entity9 , which is the home of live music , it is very poor ' .			2

stars will sing live , but to taped backing tracks
organisers blame the @entity9 weather and shape of the @entity11
