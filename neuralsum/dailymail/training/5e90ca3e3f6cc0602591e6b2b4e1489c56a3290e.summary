instead , the final scenes showed the death of the @entity13 @entity8 , @entity8 , following his army ’s defeat at @entity16			1
stitchers in the tiny @entity1 of @entity2 have completed the missing final piece of the famed @entity4			1
@entity2 ’s tapestry was masterminded by 72 - year - old @entity18 ( left ) who dreamt up the project			2
it will be on display at @entity22 in @entity23 from 1 july until 31 august but a team of embroiderers on @entity2 , a small island just off the coast of @entity9 ’s native @entity23 , have spent a year finishing the job			1
according to a report by @entity30 in the @entity31 , they made an effort to choose the right fabrics , colours and similar types of wool to the medieval original			0
the new tapestry is the same height as the original and 10ft ( 3m ) long , with four panels showing events following the @entity16 and ending in @entity9 ’s coronation			1
the first of four scenes shows @entity9 and his half - brothers dining on the battlefield at @entity16			1
the bodies of the slain lie scattered about where they have fallen			0
the caption reads ' here @entity51 @entity9 dines ' the original tapestry ( pictured ) ends with the @entity13 leaving the battlefield			2
the new ending features @entity9 's coronation in @entity56 this scene depicts early december in 1066			1
@entity9 has crossed the @entity58 at @entity59 and has reached @entity60 where the nobles submit to his rule			2
the caption reads , ' here the nobles of @entity66 surrender ' the first written record of the @entity4 is in 1476			0
it was described in the cathedral at @entity22 as ' a very long and narrow hanging on which are embroidered figures and inscriptions comprising a representation of the conquest of @entity75			0
' the @entity4 is thought to have been commissioned in the 1070s by @entity77 of @entity22 , half - brother of @entity9			2
it is over 230 feet ( 70 metres ) and tells the story of the final days of @entity8 's encounter with @entity9			1
the tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with captions embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns			0
since it was ' rediscovered ' by scholars in the 18th century , its final scene - thought to show the coronation of @entity9 - has been missing			1
according to legend , @entity91 revolutionary soldiers took it from the cathedral intending to cut it up to use as wagon covers			0
the @entity98 text reads : ‘ here @entity51 @entity9 ate			0
here the nobles of @entity66 gathered			0
here @entity9 was given the royal crown			0
and here the @entity101 proclaimed the @entity8			0
’ an @entity103 phrase from the @entity104 in 1066 is also included			0
it translates to : ‘ the end will be good , as @entity107 wills			0
’ the final design is now on display next to the original at the @entity111 in @entity23			2
@entity112 , one of the @entity2 stitchers told the @entity31 : ‘ it becomes like a drug			2
i ’d tell my husband i ’m just going to pop to the library for half an hour and return two and a half hours later			0
’ experts had previously pointed out that the opening of the tapestry has a figure of @entity121 enthroned			0
around the middle point of the tapestry there is an image of @entity9 ’s enemy @entity8 enthroned			1
‘ it would be a neat symmetry and make perfect sense of the story if the end of the tapestry had showed the victorious @entity9 enthroned , which is what the @entity2 team have chosen to do , ’ said professor @entity127 from the @entity128			1
@entity9 's worried look as he is crowned may be due to the shout of acclamation , which was thought to be a cry of rebellion			2
the caption reads : ' here they gave the crown of the kingdom to @entity9 ’ , and ‘ and here the @entity75 acclaim the king ’ the final panel depicts @entity148 in 1066 when @entity51 @entity9 was acclaimed king of @entity75			1
the caption , between the turrets of the @entity151 is in old @entity103 and reads : ' the end will be good , as @entity107 wills ' the stitching was done on @entity2 , a small island just off the coast of @entity9 's native @entity23 there are some @entity1 references that would indicate that the final panel could never have been part of the original work			1
this is the inclusion in the upper border of @entity161 depicting @entity162 , the author of the @entity164 , which tells the history of the @entity166 from the settlement of @entity23 through to the reign of @entity169 @entity162 states that @entity9 sailed to @entity75 with 696 ships			0
he says , ‘ but i have heard my father say — i remember it well , although i was but a lad - that there were seven hundred ships , less four , when they sailed from @entity176 ’			0
this might just have been possible , but @entity162 was writing in the 1160s , and the tapestry , it is believed , was created within 20 years of the @entity16			2
his inclusion in this work is because he was born in @entity183			0
