by @entity0 published : 17:24 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 5 august 2013 a healthier offering at major fast food chains could help end the obesity crisis in @entity4 , a top health and social expert has suggested			1
author @entity7 believes that to help the poor and obese , mainstream activists should stop slamming processed food altogether and join forces with the fast food industry to encourage healthier menu options			1
in an essay for the @entity14 , he says that there is ' no hard evidence ' that processed food causes obesity and diabetes			2
a better burger : @entity7 believes that food activists should focus on improving fast food chains ' menu options rather than totally eliminating products that are processed altogether mr @entity7 also slams the ' let them eat kale ' attitude of activists , calling the ideas the ' dubious health fantasies of a small , elite minority			1
' ' what percentage of the junk - food - eating obese do we want to predict will be ready to drop their @entity35 , fries , and @entity38 for grilled salmon on chard ? ' he writes			1
he believes that many food activists are out of touch because - like himself - they have little in common with the average obese @entity4			1
' that person is relatively poor , does not read the @entity44 or cookbook manifestos , [ and ] is surrounded by people who eat junk food and are themselves obese			1
' ' too bad it would largely exclude the obese masses , who would continue and die early , ' he writes			2
these statements have sparked widespread controversy , however , especially among activists like @entity56 professor @entity55 who believe that processed foods are ' evil ' and must be eliminated in favor of seasonal , ' real ' foods			1
food for thought : mr @entity7 has caused controversy with his views on the fast food industry mr @entity7 believes that , while the media has been focused on the evils of processed foods , they have ignored the drive by fast food chains to create healthier food options			1
indeed , @entity70 , the executive chef and director of culinary innovation at @entity72 , says that the debate over processed food has already had an impact on the chain 's menu			2
' some want us to have healthier food , but others want us to have minimally processed ingredients , which can mean more fat , ' he explained			2
the company already offers oatmeal and yogurt , and most recently rolled out the @entity87 - a lower - calorie , less fatty version of the ever - popular @entity89			0
many media outlets have been critical of such efforts , though , because typically , chains only trimmed 50 to 100 calories per food item			0
but obesity scientists confirm that the difference between losing weight and not losing weight is a few hundred calories a day			0
at the same time , mr @entity100 points out that that some unprocessed ' health ' foods are bigger calorie bombs that their fast food counterparts , with ' obscene quantities of fat and problem carbs '			0
' per 100 calories , tofu is as fatty as many cuts of beef , ' he writes			0
mr @entity100 found that a @entity114 booster with spirulina , chlorella and raw sea vegetables , contains more than three times the fat content - and four times the sodium - of the beef patty in a @entity35 he adds that @entity122 's ' @entity121 ' , ( peas that are fried in sunflower oil ) , have six times as much fat as protein as the fast food treat			1
mr @entity7 's article has sparked widespread backlash			1
@entity131 compares him to @entity132 and slams his ' racially and class insensitive cover story '			0
salon writes that he ' gets absolutely everything wrong about processed food and @entity4 ' health ' , and @entity139 calls his framework ' too simplisitic '			1
health debate : mr @entity7 claims that certain items from @entity114 have more fat than a @entity35 @entity145 professor @entity144 also disagrees			2
she believes that it is the government 's responsibility to address ' food deserts ' , where communities lack access to fresh produce and must instead rely on fast food			2
' if the government came into these communities and installed @entity157 filters under their sinks , they ’d drink water instead of @entity160 , ' she said			0
' what percentage of the junk - food - eating obese will be ready to drop their @entity35 , fries , and @entity38 for grilled salmon on chard ? ' but @entity167 , an obesity researcher at @entity169 , agrees with mr @entity7			1
she says low - income communities ' wo n't eat broccoli instead of french fries			0
' you try to make even a small change to school lunches , and parents and kids revolt , ' she points out			0
ironically , fast food companies often keep healthy changes under the radar			0
' people expect something to taste worse if they believe it ’s healthy , ' says @entity185 , an @entity186 neuroscientist who specializes in how the brain perceives food			0
' and that expectation affects how it tastes to them , so it actually does taste worse			0
