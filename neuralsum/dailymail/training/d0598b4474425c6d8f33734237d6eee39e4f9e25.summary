it is one of the most unique catches ever hauled aboard a fishing boat			0
in @entity6 's remote @entity5 , a crew has hauled up a creature with tentacles like fire hoses and eyes like dinner plates from a mile below the surface			1
capt. @entity13 and his crew were stunned to see a colossal squid weighing 350 kilograms ( 770 pounds ) , and as long as a minibus			1
watch scientists examine the colossal squid below in this dec. 2013 photo provided by a crew member of the boat @entity21 of @entity24 fishing company @entity22 , capt. @entity13 shows a colossal squid he and and his crew caught on the boat in @entity6 's remote @entity5			1
the colossal squid is thought to extend up to 4 - 5 metres ( 13 - 16 feet ) from tip to tentacle and weigh up to 500 kilograms			1
its relation , the giant squid , can grow a lot longer but is much more spindly			1
this specimen , like other octopus and squid species , has three hearts — one to pump blood around the body and two for its gills ( lungs ) — and is estimated to be about 3.5 metres in length			1
one of the sea 's most elusive species , it had been frozen for eight months until today , when scientists in @entity24 got a long - anticipated chance to thaw out the animal and inspect it — once they used a forklift to maneuver it into a tank			1
the squid is a female , and its eight arms are each well over a meter ( 3.3 feet ) long			1
its two tentacles would have been perhaps double that length if they had not been damaged			0
@entity60 , a squid scientist from the @entity62 who was leading a team examining the creature , described it as ' very big , very beautiful			2
' ' this is essentially an intact specimen , which is almost an unparalleled opportunity for us to examine , ' she said			0
' this is a spectacular opportunity			0
' only the second intact specimen ever found was carrying eggs when discovered in the @entity6			1
' we were excited to find that out ... as it turns out this one is a female , and it has got some eggs , ' @entity60 told reporters			1
' this was by far the most perfect colossal squid that i have seen			2

about 142,000 people from 180 countries watched streaming footage of the squid examination on the @entity96			2
colossal squid sometimes inhabit the world of fiction and imagination , but have rarely been seen in daylight			2
remarkably , @entity13 and his crew on the @entity104 toothfish boat have caught two of them			0
their first , hauled in seven years ago , is on display in @entity24 's national museum , @entity109			2
the tentacles of a colossal squid sit on the surface of the water as it is defrosted at @entity109 labs in @entity116 on september 16 , 2014			2
@entity13 said there was so much excitement about his previous catch , he thought he had better save the latest one for research			0
' it was partly alive , it was still hanging onto the fish , ' @entity13 recalls			0
' just a big bulk in the water			0
they 're huge , and the mantle 's all filled with water			2
it 's quite an awesome sight			2
' @entity132 , a senior curator at @entity109 , said scientists hope to find out more about where the creature fits in the food chain , how much genetic variation there is among different squid types , and basic facts about how the colossal squid lives and dies			0
she said scientists plan to further assess the condition of the squid before determining whether to preserve it for public display			1
@entity60 said it 's possible that ancient sightings of the species gave rise to tales of the kraken , or giant sea - monster squid			1
she said sperm whales often eat colossal squid and are known to play with their food , and sailors may have mistaken that for epic battles			0
' on the other hand , we do n't really know what the grog rations were like at that time at sea , either , ' she said			0
' so it may be that we 've got a bit of a fisherman 's story going on there , too			0

@entity183 was found in @entity6 's remote @entity5
was frozen to preserve it - until today
@entity183 is a female , and its eight arms are each well over a meter long
researchers found squid was carrying eggs
set to be preserved and possibly put on show
animals *believed* to be the *inspiration* for the ' kraken ' , a *mythical* giant sea monster
