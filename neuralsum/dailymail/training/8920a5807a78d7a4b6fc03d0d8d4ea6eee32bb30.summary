by @entity0 an 89 - year - old @entity2 war crimes suspect died in custody hours before a @entity5 ruling wednesday that he should be extradited to @entity7 to face trial			1
@entity9 died tuesday night at a @entity11 hospital , where he had been transferred saturday after a month in jail , his lawyer and the @entity14 said			1
his death was disclosed wednesday just as @entity5 magistrate @entity16 approved the extradition request , which would still have needed final @entity5 government review			0
pictured as a young @entity2 in @entity19 and again in his declining years , @entity9 died tuesday night in a @entity11 hospital only hours before a @entity5 ruling that he should be extradited to @entity7 for trial @entity16 found probable cause that @entity9 was the person being sought by @entity7 authorities over his suspected service as an ss guard at @entity27 during @entity19 ' no statute of limitations offers a safe haven for murder , ' he wrote in his ruling			1
@entity5 marshals had arrested @entity9 in june outside his longtime home in @entity11			2
he was facing charges of aiding in the killing of 216,000 @entity38 men , women and children at a @entity2 death camp			1
' as outlined by @entity7 , a death camp guard such as @entity9 could not have served at @entity27 during the peak of the @entity2 reign of terror in 1944 without knowing that hundreds of thousands of human beings were being brutally slaughtered in gas chambers and then burned on site , ' @entity16 wrote			1
' a daily parade of freight trains delivered hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children , most of whom simply vanished overnight			0
yet , the screams , the smells , and the pall of death permeated the air			0
the allegations establish that @entity9 can no longer deceive himself and others of his complicity in such horror , ' the judge said			2
@entity9 claimed he was unaware of the massive slaughter at @entity27 and then that he did not participate in it , but ' the @entity7 allegations belie his claims , ' the judge wrote			1
@entity9 died at @entity70 , according to his lawyer , @entity72 , and the @entity14			2
the lawyer said @entity9 's health had deteriorated in jail but he did n't know the cause of death			1
@entity7 authorities in the @entity80 town of @entity81 issued a 2013 warrant charging @entity9 with accessory to murder under the theory that the death camp 's sole function was to kill people			1
the same legal strategy had been used to charge and convict former @entity91 autoworker @entity90 on charges he served as a death camp guard at @entity94 in occupied @entity95			1
@entity90 died in a @entity80 nursing home in 2012 while appealing his 2011 conviction			2
the 2013 warrant accused @entity9 of 158 counts of accessory to murder — one count for each trainload of victims brought to the @entity27 death camp in occupied @entity95 from may to october 1944 , when he was allegedly a guard there			1
' it is particularly unfortunate that @entity9 could not be brought to justice in view of the significant efforts that were invested in trying to hold him accountable for his service at the @entity27 death camp , ' said @entity112 , the head @entity2 hunter at the @entity114 in @entity115			1
' this setback should in no way discourage or hamper the efforts to bring other perpetrators to justice at this time			0
' @entity9 told @entity0 in a 2012 interview that while he was a guard at @entity27 , he was assigned to a part of the camp that was not involved in the slaughter of @entity38 and others			1
' i did n't kill anybody , i did n't rape anybody — and i do n't even have a traffic ticket here , ' he said			0
' i did n't do anything wrong			0
' @entity9 told @entity0 in a 2012 interview that while he was a guard at @entity27 , he was assigned to a part of the camp that was not involved in the slaughter of @entity38 and others @entity9 moved to @entity11 after @entity19 and for decades lived a quiet , middle - class life with his wife , children and grandchildren			1
he had @entity5 citizenship because his mother was born in the @entity5 ; she later moved to @entity140 , where @entity9 was born			2
in 1992 , the @entity5 government tried to revoke @entity9 's citizenship after discovering his wartime background			2
the effort became a yearslong legal saga and appeared to end with a 2003 decision that found @entity9 had joined the @entity147 as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participating in it			0
then he was arrested last month outside his home in northeast @entity11 based on the @entity7 warrant			1
officials say the arrest was delayed for a year because of the complexity of the extradition request			0
his lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that @entity9 should remain at home pending the extradition hearing because of his frail health			0
they said he has mild dementia , heart conditions and has suffered strokes in recent years			0
@entity16 initially ruled that the federal prison system was capable of caring for @entity9 , although he reversed himself monday after what he called the ' emergency hospitalization ' and granted bail			0
@entity9 's wife and survivors could not immediately be reached for comment wednesday			2
messages left at his home were not immediately returned			0
this hurts the families of the victims			0
this hurts anyone who is interested in justice , ' @entity112 said .			0
