' @entity2 's @entity43 are currently on a 10 - day pre-season training camp in @entity45 and they demanded that the match against @entity24 was postponed after the incident			1
@entity27 was sent off by the referee after being seen to kick out at his opponent but the club have revealed their belief that the midfielder , usually a level - headed young man , was racially abused moments before he lashed out			2
the incident took place just before the half - time break			0
the decision to postpone the match was a unilateral one taken by the management staff present and @entity2 is understood to be unequivocal in his backing of the young player , who is said to have been left deeply distressed by the incident			1
a club statement on tuesday evening read : ' @entity4 's @entity66 game with @entity24 has today ( tuesday ) been cancelled due to an alleged incident of racial abuse toward the club 's young midfielder , @entity15 by a member of the opposing team			1
youngster : fofana in action during an under - 21 match against @entity77 last season at the @entity79 unfortunately , this is n't the first example in which a team have staged a walk - off after alleged racial abuse : - in 2013 , @entity85 led his @entity87 team - mates off the pitch after black players were subjected to racist abuse during a friendly at fourth division side @entity92			1
the former @entity94 and @entity95 forward kicked the ball into the crowd after 26 minutes of the goalless match in @entity99 - later that year , @entity87 were rocked by another racism flashpoint as @entity101 reacted angrily to tormentors in a pre-season tournament but he was substituted rather than the match being abandoned			2
- also in 2013 , a @entity106 under - 19 side were taking part in the @entity108 in @entity109 when academy coach @entity110 ordered his players to leave the pitch after alleged racist abuse			0
' following an alleged incident in the latter stages of the first half of the game , being played in @entity45 , @entity13 , a decision was taken by the management staff to withdraw the @entity4 team from the field of play and cancel the game			1
' @entity127 representatives in @entity13 and in @entity128 are liaising with officials , the match organisers and the @entity125 to pursue this matter further			2
' @entity24 , however , appear to have distanced themselves from speculation that one of their players made racist comments towards @entity27			2
a statement on their website read : ' @entity4 coach @entity2 entered the field , something was discussed with the referee , and then to the amazement of a well - filled stadium he took his team off the pitch			2
what are the reasons ? they are known only to him			0
' city are incensed after this became the fourth case of alleged racist abuse directed towards one of their players in the last two years and privately they are furious that more is not being done to tackle backwards attitudes on the continent			0
no laughing matter : @entity2 took his players off the pitch after allegations of racist abuse during pre-season making his point : @entity2 was integral to @entity4 's players development and was in pre-season stepping in : after the incident , @entity4 coach @entity2 stepped in to have the game cancelled previous : @entity85 led his @entity87 team - mates off the pitch after black players were subjected to racist abuse in 2013 video racism in football wo n't change - @entity174 only in march , fellow @entity43 player @entity174 , the son of former @entity176 player @entity175 , was the victim of racial abuse during a @entity179 match at @entity180			1
the player was targeted by players and supporters , and is understood to have even be spat at as he left the field			0
even a tannoy announcement made during the game did not stem the tide of bile aimed at @entity174			0
@entity179 's response was a fine of just € 10,000 euros and a partial closure of their youth stadium for a future game			0
it also follows the alleged monkey chants by @entity199 supporters directed towards @entity200 in last season 's @entity202 clash in @entity204 and the same kind of alleged derogatory noises aimed at @entity207 during a @entity209 match against @entity210 in 2012			0
