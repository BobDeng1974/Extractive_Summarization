the @entity22 : @entity7 and @entity16 tried their hand at table football on a visit to @entity27 the @entity2 duo celebrate their victory , as mr @entity7 faced more questions about getting his ' star player ' back on the @entity2 frontbench in @entity34 as the pm faced fresh questions about mr @entity16 's ambitions , he put the @entity38 mayor on defensive duties for the football match a new poll by @entity42 puts the @entity43 two points ahead for the first time in two years according to a new survey by @entity47 , 34 per cent of people say they will back the @entity43 at the next general election , with only 32 per cent supporting @entity9			1
