he stepped out of a chauffeur - driven @entity1 , trotted up a flight of steps , slapped a circle of newly - installed @entity5 firmly on the back , and asked the night ’s big question : ‘ right then , where ’s the bar ? ’ @entity9 breezed into @entity11 ’s historic @entity10 to meet the supporters who have devoted recent months to engineering a stunning election victory that has re-drawn @entity15 ’s political map			1
first , though , he had to navigate his way through a sea of newspaper and tv crews who had descended from across @entity21 , blocking the entrance to the hall where votes had just been tallied			2
‘ i ’ll be very happy , ’ @entity9 replied , ‘ once this part of the night is all over , and i can get to our private party			1
’ but first : business			2
three nights after he declared a ‘ political earthquake ’ and announced that ‘ the @entity28 fox is in @entity45 ’s hen house ’ , @entity9 was once more eager to sing the praises of what he likes to call his ‘ people ’s army ’			1
‘ we formed our people ’s army to take on the establishment , and it looks like we ’ve won a great victory , ’ he said			2
‘ but we ’re getting used to this			2
and you know what ? i quite like it ! ’ there was indeed a practised air to the way @entity9 celebrated his success			1
he had begun the evening at what an aide described as a ‘ modest but serviceable ’ local hotel , dining on steak sandwich topped with a healthy dollop of mustard ‘ @entity72 , not @entity71 ’			2
the @entity28 leader ’s @entity34 wife , @entity73 , was then dispatched to the count early , clutching a bag bursting with miniature bottles of pink champagne to hand to supporters			1
by the time @entity9 arrived , in a grey pinstripe suit , the warmth of the mood could be gauged from regular whoops of delight coming from the bar , where a tv was tuned to the @entity88 ’s results programme			1
before he could clamp his lips around the first pint of bitter , it was time to consider the effect of his victory – breaking more than a century of @entity94 , @entity95 and conservative electoral domination – on the political map			1
@entity28 leader @entity9 enjoyed a pint of beer in @entity100 , @entity101 , before the election results started to roll in already , there are whispers in conservative circles of a pact with @entity28 at the 2015 election			1
and even @entity108 was on television yesterday morning discussing his newfound ‘ respect ’ for the party			0
it ’s certainly a world away from his compadre @entity121 ’s now infamous 2006 aside , during a radio interview , where he declared : ‘ @entity28 is sort of a bunch of … fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists , mostly			1
’ ‘ after nine years of abuse , i was quite surprised , ’ @entity9 said			1
‘ i nearly choked on my breakfast			0
but yes , he was trying to be nice i think and decided that throwing abuse at us does n’t work			0
it only makes us more popular			0
’ as to whether a pact is on the cards , he insisted – and this is undoubtedly how results will today be spun – that @entity95 now has as much to fear from @entity28 ’s rise as the @entity133			1
‘ look at the results			0
the really big hits we ’re getting are in the north of @entity72 from the @entity95			1
‘ you know , actually the @entity139 vote looks to me like it ’s holding up quite steadily in many areas			0
or more than perhaps it might have			0
so it ’s not quite as bad a night for @entity121 as people have predicted			0
counting votes cast in the @entity15 began on sunday , with officials in @entity11 pictured arranging long ballot papers into piles ‘ so i would n’t have thought there ’s any prospect of a deal with the @entity139			1
firstly , i do n’t think they ’d want to offer it , and secondly , electorally , i do n’t think it would make much sense for us either			0
‘ i think it would be extremely unlikely , is my take			0
the analysis is that we ’ve hurt @entity95			1
in 2009 , when we came second at the last @entity21 election , they said it was a high water mark , and that we ’d never do it in a domestic election			2
‘ then last year in @entity72 county elections we did			0
so then people tried to say it was all just a protest vote and that we would go away			0
now there ’s another protest vote and another high water mark			0
‘ once we get this out of the way , the people ’s army is off to @entity175 , where we have a by - election in a month			2
’ and who would now bet against yet another high water mark there ?			0

@entity28 tops the polls in large parts of the country , pushing @entity95 into 2nd
@entity9 *quipped* ' where 's the bar ? ' as he arrived into @entity11
he met supporters who have spent months engineering election campaign
