the @entity0 plans to defy @entity1 and permanently shutter the military detention facility at @entity3 , @entity4 , setting the stage for an epic throw - down on @entity7 over the future home of 149 terrorists – including some of the most dangerous individuals the @entity11 has ever captured			1
@entity12 signed an executive order on the first day of his presidency declaring his intention to close down ' @entity16 , ' as it 's called in @entity18 circles , and send its population of war - on - terror captives to domestic prisons or repatriate them			1
both @entity1 and the @entity11 public strongly oppose the plan			2
house speaker @entity24 told @entity25 in a statement that ' even as @entity28 jihadists are beheading @entity11 , the @entity0 is so eager to bring these terrorists from @entity3 to the @entity11 that it is examining ways to thwart @entity1 and unilaterally re-write the law			1
' former president @entity32 declined comment through a spokesman			1
' not only is this scheme dangerous , ' @entity24 said , ' it is yet another example of what will be this administration ’s legacy of lawlessness			0
' @entity81 polled @entity11 in june after @entity12 swapped five @entity83 prisoners for @entity85 sgt. @entity84 , who reportedly deserted his unit in @entity87 before being captured			1
just 29 per cent supported closing @entity3 , and 66 per cent were opposed			2
it 's clear that there 's nothing resembling serious support for the idea on @entity7			0
in may 2009 , with both houses of @entity1 in @entity96 hands , the @entity45 voter 90 – 6 against adding $ 80 million to the @entity11 defense budget that @entity12 had requested to pay for his plan			1
' the @entity11 people do n’t want these men walking the streets of @entity11 ’s neighborhoods , ' @entity100 @entity99 sen. @entity99 said at the time			0
' the @entity11 people do n’t want these detainees held at a military base or federal prison in their back yard , either			2
' @entity110 sen. @entity109 told @entity25 on friday that @entity12 's zeal to close @entity16 for political gain ' is exceeded only by his willingness to bypass @entity1 and ignore the law in order to accomplish it			1
' ' with the threat of terrorism on the rise , the president should be focusing on strengthening @entity11 national security , ' @entity109 said , ' but instead he is attempting to check boxes before the midterm elections			2
' the @entity123 noted friday that most of the facility 's prisoners – there were 800 enemy combatants there at one point – were released before @entity12 took office			2
but those who remain are a boiled - down worst - of - the - worst , the most hardened terrorists the @entity11 has ever put in handcuffs			0
gloves off : house speaker @entity24 , an @entity134 @entity35 , blasted @entity12 's @entity16 plan as part of a ' legacy of lawlessness ' at what cost ? army sgt. @entity140 was freed from captivity in may after @entity12 traded him for five hardened @entity83 fighters now former cia director @entity143 says the ' @entity144 ' were released because the @entity0 wants to shrink the @entity16 population to a size where maintaining the prison wo n't make economic sense the @entity123 cited an unnamed senior administration official who said @entity12 is ' unwavering in his commitment ' to closing the prison , and wants options for a coming day when he lays out his presidential legacy			1
@entity1 bans the transfer of @entity3 detainees to the @entity11 each year when it sends the @entity156 to the president for his signature			2
@entity12 would face a firestorm of angry lawmakers if he were to hamstring the @entity18 by vetoing the entire bill over that @entity162 would also risk a slap from the @entity164 , and a relentless public backlash – especially from @entity11 in states with prisons that could house transferred detainees – if he chose to ignore @entity1 ' restraints and do it anyway			1
worst of the worst , but where to put him ? @entity171 was the top organizer of the 9/11 terror attacks that could come via a ' signing statement , ' a controversial self - administered vaccine against @entity1 that some presidents have used to indicate that they 're enacting a law even though they think narrow parts of it are unconstitutional			0
former cia director @entity143 said friday morning that the president is desperate enough to whittle down @entity3 's numbers that he seized the opportunity in may to clear out five captives through a prisoner swap while freeing @entity140			1
' i think the @entity140 trade ... was about trying to get rid of terrorists that are incarcerated in @entity16 , get them taken by somebody else or freed , so there 's less and less pressure on the president to keep @entity16 going , ' @entity143 said on the @entity193			1
the numbers suggest @entity143 could be right			0
it costs the @entity18 $ 2.7 million per year to keep each inmate at @entity16			0
the comparable annual cost for housing a prisoner at a @entity199 in the @entity11 is just $ 78,000			0
' as the number becomes smaller at @entity3 , the case for domestic transfers ... becomes that much stronger , ' a senior administration official told the @entity123			0
the nonpartisan @entity204 found in august that the @entity0 broke federal law by spending nearly $ 1 million on the @entity140 prisoner swap despite a congressional ban			1
' i think it is dangerous , ' @entity143 added			0
' and they 're down now to 149 , i think , prisoners			0
and most of these , like @entity171 , are really dyed - in - the - wool terrorists			0

the @entity0 is *mulling* ways to fulfill the president 's promise to close the military prison at @entity3 , @entity4 but it houses 149 terrorists
former president @entity32 declined comment through a spokesman
house speaker @entity24 said the @entity0 is ' eager ' to bring @entity16 prisoners to the @entity11 ' even as @entity28 jihadists are beheading @entity11 '
*massive* public opposition – 66 per cent , according to @entity81 – will make the move politically toxic but @entity12 is ' unwavering in his commitment '
@entity232 senator in tight *re-election* race vows ' if he tries it ... i will shut down the @entity45 ! '
former @entity238 director : @entity12 is so desperate to fulfill pledge that he *approved* @entity140 prisoner swap to clear some of the @entity83 out
