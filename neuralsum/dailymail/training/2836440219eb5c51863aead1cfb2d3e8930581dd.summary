researchers have revealed one of the best preserved fossil sites ever discovered			1
the fossil site in @entity4 in the north - eastern region of @entity6 has revealed scorched tissue , and 're - crystallized ' sections of bone on fossil			1
experts say the site is similar to the effect of the eruption of @entity15 in a.d. 79 buried @entity16 , @entity17 and other cities , entombing people and animals in suspended death poses			1
typical entombment poses of some of the @entity4 ¿ s animals - a @entity26 ( a ) and primitive crow - like birds ( b and c )			1
the poses are similar to those displayed by other victims of erupting volcanoes throughout history			2
an ancient ecosystem known as the @entity4 existed in north eastern @entity6 about 120 million to 130 million years ago			1
it consisted of dinosaurs , mammals , early birds , fish , lizards and other creatures , with the red areas highlighted below having thrown up fossils			0
the animals lived among coniferous forests and lakes , in the shadow of volcanoes			0
fossils of these animals are found in the @entity49 and @entity50 rock formations , embedded in layers of volcanic material			0
the team studied 14 fossils along with the chemistry and mineralogy of the volcanic rock and sediment that formed the animals final resting place			0
' what we 're talking about in this case is literal charring , like somebody got put in the grill , " said @entity60 , a mineralogist at the @entity61 in @entity62 , one of the researchers of the study			2
' the lower @entity49 and @entity50 formations contain numerous exceptionally well - preserved invertebrate , vertebrate and plant fossils that comprise the @entity4 , ' the researchers wrote in @entity77			1
' @entity78 and terrestrial fossils of the biota usually occur together within some horizons and have been interpreted as deposits of mass mortality events			0
' the nature of the events and the mechanisms behind the exceptional preservation of the fossils , however , are poorly understood			0
' the team believe that a massive volcanic eruption is to blame , when a scorching flood of rocks and ash petrified them			2
in the left picture , subtly waved , planar - lamination in sediments is seen overlying the skeletons of a @entity26 ( a , b ) and a @entity99			2
the right hand image shows closeups of bone with black char marks visible			2
@entity16 and @entity17 were buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the @entity15 volcano , which towers over the @entity108 in southern @entity109 , in ad 79			1
just after midday on august 24 , fragments of ash , pumice , and other volcanic debris began pouring down on @entity16 , quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet and causing the roofs of many houses to fall in			1
fine - grained volcanic ash that encloses the remains probably formed moulds around complete skeletons , resembling the intact , buried corpses at @entity16			1
fresh , hot , dry , acid volcanic ash promoted burning , charring or mummifying of soft tissues , which , as a result , became more resistant to decay and better preserved			2
the carcasses were then transported into low - lying volcanic lakes , where they remained until humans unearthed them , the team believe			0
' after examining and analysing sediments and residual fossils from several key horizons , we postulate that the causal events were mainly phreatomagmatic eruptions			0
' pyroclastic density currents were probably responsible for the major causalities and for transporting the bulk of the terrestrial vertebrates from different habitats , such as lizards , birds , non-avian dinosaurs and mammals , into lacustrine environments for burial			0
' terrestrial vertebrate carcasses transported by and sealed within the pyroclastic flows were clearly preserved as exceptional fossils through this process			0
' though famous fish fossils have emerged from the region , only terrestrial fossils — birds , lizards , mammals — showed marks of transport by these volcanic pyroclastic flows , the team say			0
fresh , hot , dry , acid volcanic ash promoted burning , charring or mummifying of soft tissues , which , as a result , became more resistant to decay and better preserved			0
experts say the site is similar to the effect of the eruption of @entity15 in a.d. 79 buried @entity16 , @entity17 and other cities , entombing people and animals in suspended death poses			1
