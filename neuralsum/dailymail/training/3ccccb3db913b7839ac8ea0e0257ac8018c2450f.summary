by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 6 september 2012 @entity2 boss @entity1 has launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘ idiots ’ who should ‘ b * * * * * off ’			1
the outspoken chief executive of the budget airline said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘ stupid ’ and it is right they are charged £ 60 a time to have one printed at the check - in desk because it is their ‘ * * * * up ’			2
his remarks came after passenger @entity19 was forced to pay £ 236 to print boarding passes for herself , her parents , and her two children so they could fly home to @entity24 from @entity25 , @entity26			1
not impressed : @entity2 chief @entity27 has declared that his passengers who do n't like paying for printed boarding passes should ' bu * * er off ' mr @entity1 said : ‘ mother pays £ 200 for being an idiot and failing to comply with her agreement at the time of booking			1
we think mrs @entity19 should pay € 60 ( £ 47.40 ) for being so stupid			2
’ mrs @entity19 , 35 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , criticised @entity2 ’s rule and said she was unable to print her family ’s passes while they were in @entity26 for 15 days last month			1
she was backed by more than 350,000 @entity42 users after complaining of her ‘ unfair ’ treatment by the @entity45 no - frills airline , which has been frequently criticised for its extra charges			0
charged : @entity19 , pictured with her children @entity48 and @entity49 , had to pay @entity2 £ 236 after she forgot to print her family 's boarding passes but mr @entity1 said she should have printed the passes at an internet cafe or asked a friend to print and fax them to her			1
instead , he said , ‘ she then comes home and gets on @entity58 , @entity56 help us all , and somehow we are going to change our policies			0
no , we ’re not ’			0
he said mrs @entity19 , who was staying at a rural villa without internet access , had written to him last week to ask for ‘ compensation and a gesture of goodwill ’			0
mr @entity1 , 51 , said the airline has replied , ‘ politely but firmly ’ , saying : ‘ thank you mrs @entity19 , but it was your * * * * up			2
’ he admitted she was not alone in complaining about the rule , but said the 0.02 per cent of his passengers , which equates to 15,800 of its 79million , who do not print off passes every year should ‘ b * * * * * off ’			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ his comments say a lot about his airline			0
' why should anyone have to spend their precious time abroad having to find a cafe or a hotel to print out a boarding pass ? ’ .			0

passengers must print passes up to two weeks before
@entity27 told those who do n't like rule to ' bu * * er off '
it comes after passenger @entity19 's complaints
@entity24 mother , 35 , had to pay £ 236 for passes in @entity26
