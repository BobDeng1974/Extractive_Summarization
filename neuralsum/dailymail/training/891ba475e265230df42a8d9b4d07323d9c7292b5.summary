by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 22:52 est , 29 july 2013 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 are among the most popular baby names from the twentieth century - and they are all based on well - known personalities of their time			1
a new study has revealed the 10 girls and boys names that saw the biggest spikes in the 1900s , and through - out the years it was always star sportsmen , famous actors and actresses and even military chiefs who captured the imagination of parents			1
in 1937 , the most trendy name given to baby girls was @entity24			2
at that time @entity25 was an actress who often played the model daughter in films and tv shows			0
@entity29 : these are the top trendiest boys and girls names according @entity32 looking back on 2013 , data may reveal a huge spike in certain unusual names			2
perhaps @entity36 , @entity37 , or even @entity38 may briefly flare in popularity before returning to obscurity			0
@entity32 used the @entity42 's data to track the trendiest names of the past century , and the results are interesting in that they can almost always be directly linked to events or popular culture of the time			1
there are always ' regular ' names , such as @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 , that maintain a certain level of use			0
it 's the more unusual names that go from nothing to hugely popular and back again that @entity32 is interested in			2
popular : the name of @entity62 's @entity61 character @entity63 ( left ) peaked in 2012 , while girls called @entity3 ( right ) are likely to have been born in 1994 ' if a small percentage of the baby population was given a name one year and a relatively much higher percentage of the next year 's baby population got said name , we consider that a trendy name , ' according to @entity32			1
the website used a mathematical equation to find out which names had the highest ' relative risk ' - the probability of a name being used that generally has a low likelihood statistically			2
many of the names that proved the most trendy can be easily linked to contemporary events			1
wishful thinking : @entity25 ( left ) often played the ideal daughter and her name was given to many girls in 1937 , while @entity88 ( right ) was the namesake of boys the year he was elected president the number one most trendy girl name was @entity1 , which reached its peak in 1972 , when a character in the popular soap where the heart is gave birth to a baby girl and named her @entity99			1
the name @entity102 spiked in 1967 , the year @entity100 starred in the film @entity104			0
the name @entity106 reached its high the year the hugely popular @entity107 debuted on television			0
many baby girls were named @entity111 in 1978 , the year the @entity110 album @entity111 came out			0
1978 : the @entity110 album release coincided with a jump in baby girls named @entity111 and @entity116 spiked in 1997 , another soap opera name from the @entity119 telenovela @entity120			1
there was a jump in boys with the unusual name of @entity88 in 1913 , the year @entity88 was elected president			0
other names are n't as easy to place			0
in 2005 , there was a spike in baby boys who were named @entity130 , which @entity32 tentatively puts down to @entity132 , a ' star ' of the reality television show @entity132			0
the popularity of the name @entity136 rose in 1964 , but the analyst of the data could n't put forth a candidate from whom the name might have gained it popularity			0
@entity32 also noted a trend for uniqueness in the past few decades , meaning people are using more unique names than ever before			1
what 's in a name : these are the top five names for boys and girls per quarter century from 1880			1

names that have had short - term yet *dramatic* spikes over the past century can often be directly linked to *historical* events or popular culture
the number one most trendy name for girls , peaking in 1972 , is @entity1 - the name of a soap opera character
presidents , singers , actors and sports stars names have also spiked in relation to popularity
