by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 11:24 est , 5 june 2013 we will one day be able to talk to animals using mobile phone - sized gadgets , says a leading expert in animal behaviour			1
professor @entity7 is developing new technology that interprets the calls of the prairie dog and says the technology could eventually be used to interpret other animals			1
he also suggested that the technology could one day be fine - tuned to enable humans to talk back to animals and engage in conversation			1
professor @entity7 says that dogs may be able to express a preference for certain foods using the new technology			1
he also hopes that communicating with them may help treat behavioural problems in an interview with the @entity23 , professor @entity7 explained he is using new artificial intelligence ( @entity26 ) software to record the calls of prairie dogs			1
he is then using the @entity26 techniques to analyse the barks and translate them into @entity31			2
he explained that from his research , he knew that prairie dogs warn other members of the pack about potential dangers in great detail – even describing a threat as being a ‘ thin , brown coyote approaching quickly ’			1
the professor , who has spent the past 30 years analysing the behaviour of animals , added : ‘ i think we have the technology now to be able to develop the devices that are , say , the size of a cellphone , that would allow us to talk to our dogs and cats			1
the film @entity50 may become a reality in less than a decade thanks to new technology ‘ so the dog says " bark ! " and the device analyses it and says , " i want to eat chicken tonight			2
" ' or the cat can say " meow , " and it can say , " you have n't cleaned my litterbox recently "			0
' he estimated that it would take between five and ten years of extensive research to get to this point			2
if such technology became a reality , it would change the world , he explained : ‘ consider that , for example , 40 per cent of all households in @entity73 have dogs , 33 per cent have cats -- at least one cat , at least one dog			1
' and consider that something like four million dogs are euthanised every year because of behavioural problems			1
' well , most problems are because of the lack of communication between animal and human			2
the human ca n't get across to the animal what the human expects , and the animal ca n't get across to the human what it 's experiencing			2
' and if we had a chance to talk back and forth , the dog could say , " you 're scaring me			0
" and you could say , " well , i 'm sorry , i did n't realise that i was scaring you			0
i 'll give you more space			0
" ' what i 'm hoping , actually , is that down the road , we will be forming partnerships with animals , rather than exploiting animals			0
' he added that many people are afraid of animals or they have nothing to do with them because they do n't think that animals have anything to contribute to their lives			0
he predicts that once people get to the point where they can start talking to animals , they 'll realise that animals are living , breathing , thinking beings , and that they have much to contribute to people 's lives			0

previous attempts to help human understand animals include the @entity142			0
the @entity144 device claims to translate barks from dozens of different breeds of dogs , including mixed - breeds			2
based on dr. @entity150 's @entity149 developed at @entity151 , the device interprets barks and chooses one of 200 phrases that supposedly reflects what the the dog is saying			0
the device was successful enough to be brought to the @entity73 market , and was even named one of 2002 's best inventions by @entity161			0
but reports of the @entity142 's accuracy have been mixed with popular product - review website @entity164 giving it a low 1.5 star average			0
in 2003 the same company launched a follow - up product for cats called @entity170 although this was less successful .			0

animal behaviour expert professor @entity7 is developing technology that can translate the complex calls of prairie dogs
he says that in 5 to 10 years , similar software could be available to have conversations with farm animals , lions and *tigers* and even pets
said that pets will be able to tell owners what they want for dinner and that being able to talk with dogs could help treat behavioural problems
