to date , the overwhelming majority of astronauts have been men , with @entity3 as an example only recently sending a woman to space after an absence of female cosmonauts for several decades			2
but the first manned mission to @entity10 should be all women , a science writer who took part in a simulated mission to the red planet has claimed			1
she says that females require a lower calorific intake than men and thus need fewer resources , making an all - women mission to @entity10 cheaper and more feasible			1
@entity26 for @entity27 took part in a simulated mission to the red planet called @entity31 ( shown )			1
she found that women needed much less resources than men			1
most women burned less than 2,000 calories per day , but men regularly exceeded 3,000 the argument was made by @entity23 - based writer @entity26 for @entity27			1
last year she took part in a @entity41 project called @entity31 ( @entity42 and @entity43 ) , which simulated a long - duration mission to @entity10 on @entity45			2
ms @entity26 and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in a dome on @entity49 , only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits			1
this was intended to simulate what an actual mission to @entity10 might be like , with the crew spending most of their time in a structure			2
on @entity10 any future mission will be subject to limited resources , meaning any attempt at such a mission will need to find ways to improve sustainability			2
and ms @entity26 says sending only women to @entity10 could be the answer , based on her studies throughout the simulated mission			1
the £ 620,000 ( $ 1 million ) @entity31 ( @entity42 and @entity43 ) mission 's crew spent four months 8,000 feet ( 2,440 metres ) above sea level in a geodesic - dome habitat on the northern slope of the @entity74 volcano			0
the volcano is a barren landscape , an abandoned quarry with little vegetation that 's as similar to @entity10 ' landscape as planet @entity45 can get			0
the crew members live under @entity10 - like conditions			0
according to @entity31 ' communication latencies and blackouts , in close quarters , under strict water - use rules , etc ' are part of the deal			0
the food study was designed to test food preparation strategies for long - term space exploration			0
@entity31 aims to address problems that may be encountered in future space missions by simulating exploration in areas of the world similar to space environments			0
the aim of the first mission in which ms @entity26 took part , funded by @entity41 's @entity100 , the @entity101 and @entity102 , was to learn about living and cooking in @entity10			1
the third and latest mission started on 17 october 2014 , and will conclude on 15 july 2015			0
in december @entity41 will fly the @entity107 spacecraft on an unmanned test for the first time			0
@entity107 will ultimately be used to take astronauts to and from @entity10 in the future , but ms @entity26 argues that the first mission to the red planet should be composed of only women ' week in and week out , the three female crew members expended less than half the calories of the three male crew members			1
less than half ! ' she says			0
' we were all exercising roughly the same amount - at least 45 minutes a day for five consecutive days a week - but our metabolic furnaces were calibrated in radically different ways			0
' she says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day , whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000			1
her conclusion is that sending women to @entity10 would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men			2
most estimates for a mission to @entity10 tend to be around £ 60 billion ( $ 100 billion ) , but she quotes former @entity41 contractor @entity133 as saying that smaller astronauts are a more attractive option than large men			2
' small women have n't been demonstrated to be appreciably dumber than big women or big men , so there 's no reason to choose larger people for a flight crew when it 's brain power you want , ' said @entity133			0
' the logical thing to do is to fly small women			0
' ms @entity26 adds that most astronauts prefer to work in diverse groups of men and women			1
' still , if the bottom line is what matters in getting to @entity10 , the more women the better , ' she concludes			0
on @entity10 any future mission will be subject to limited resources , meaning any attempt at such a mission will need to find ways to improve sustainability			2
and ms @entity26 says sending only women to @entity10 could be the answer , based on her studies throughout the simulated mission			1

@entity23 writer says the first mission to @entity10 should be only women
@entity26 for @entity27 took part in a simulated mission to the red planet
she found that women needed much less resources than men
most women burned less than 2,000 calories per day , but men regularly exceeded 3,000 calories
ms @entity26 says female astronauts , with *typically* smaller *bodies* than men , would thus be better suited for an *expensive* mission to @entity10
