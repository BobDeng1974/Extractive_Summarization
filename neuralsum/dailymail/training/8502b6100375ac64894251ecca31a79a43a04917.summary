' but when you ’re making false allegations against a headteacher it ’s extremely serious because as we ’ve heard it seriously affected that person ’s private life , his reputation and the stress it caused in relation to his job			2
' people in positions of responsibility are there and up there to be shot at and it ’s a very easy target and the effect on those people when false allegations are made is extremely damaging			0
