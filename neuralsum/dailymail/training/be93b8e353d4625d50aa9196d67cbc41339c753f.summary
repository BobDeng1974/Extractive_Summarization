by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 4 november 2013 covered in glitter under the glare of show lights , the @entity2 circus troupe perform to an audience of one in the middle of nowhere			1
for these @entity10 transgender performers , this is just another day in the office			1
the vaudeville group , who market themselves as a circus , have been touring the country for 10 years performing musical numbers and dirty jokes			2
though audience numbers range from 0 to 400 , the group puts on all the bells and whistles every night without fail			2
another day in the office : @entity23 performs for an audience of one			0
the performers in @entity10 's transgender @entity28 always act as if the stadium is full take a bow : ten of the 15 members of @entity2 , a @entity10 transgender circus , conclude their show of musical numbers , jokes and flame - throwing for their small audience @entity38 , summer or winter , the girls stick to their sparkling bikinis and worn - out stockings all year round			1
to complete the line up , stiletto - clad @entity42 eats flames as the main attraction			2
the conventionally striped @entity46 has been customised with stars , and they have set up colourful lights to swirl across the ceiling			0
they pack and carry the tents and the wooden planks used for seating			0
their tent , set up on the dirt , has a capacity for 400 people			1
mobile home : @entity60 applies her make up in for her performance in the capital , @entity63			0
she earns around £ 75 a month but is happy for a protective home carnival : the lively show is one of many to pop up across @entity68 as the transgender scene booms			2
here drag queen @entity70 jokes with the audience acts : @entity42 spits flames as the show of musical numbers and double - entendre jokes crescendos			0
shows like this have sparked a wave of @entity81 tourism it is a protective home for the 15 stars in a country which did not legalise gay sex until 1999 - in a predominantly catholic @entity68			1
brutal attacks on homosexuals still fill the headlines of @entity10 's newspaper - just last week a young man was beaten into a coma			1
the transgender performers are often mocked and some of them have suffered violent attacks			1
' the verbal aggressions and attacks continue , even after the passing of the anti-discrimination law , ' said @entity99 , 40 , who is one of the founding members of the show			0
packed : sometimes they have just one person in the stadium fit for 400			0
tonight drag queen @entity42 's act is a hit with dozens of people gathered for the show make up : @entity109 applies foundation			2
the show go on all year round , even in the harsh winter with performers wearing small bikinis and worn out stockings they earn between £ 75 and £ 150 a month - well below @entity10 's monthly minimum wage of £ 240			1
but they say they do n't mind the pay because they enjoy their job and have few expenses			0
' it 's the only work i have			0
elsewhere they do n't give me work because i am a homosexual , ' said 34 - year - old @entity60			0
however , with the surgery industry booming and the gradual introduction of hate crime laws across the continent , @entity2 's troupers are slowly harbouring the confidence to express themselves publicly			1
work : drag queen @entity134 would not work in an office where she would have to dress as a man			0
the continent is becoming more @entity81 - friendly but backlash remains movement : as hate crime laws are brought into the catholic country , the performers are slowly harbouring the confidence to express themselves publicly on october 10 , @entity144 granted a six - year - old transgender girl a female @entity147 card			1
the nation , which has similar underground performance acts to @entity2 , is currently obsessing over top - ranking television show @entity151 ( @entity152 ) , which reeled in viewers with transvestite host @entity154 and , after legalising gay marriage in 2009 - three years ahead of the @entity158 - a same - sex wedding fashion show is a cultural highlight of the year			1
transgender operations are also on the rise , as the lucrative plastic surgery industry casts their net wider			0
unlike in @entity158 , cosmetic surgery is available to people of all social and economic classes			0
@entity2 : they call it a circus but it 's more like a vaudeville show put on by transgenders and drag queens , who have been an act for over a decade there is no stigma - it is viewed as an oppourtunity to fix unfortunate biological flaws			1
in @entity179 and @entity180 , universities run programmes to offer operations to the lowest on the economic spectrum			0
as a result , acts like @entity2 are now spreading out of the metropolitan hubs such as @entity187 and into the rural towns			2
it has sparked a wave of @entity81 ( @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity195 ) tourism in @entity68 , as people from similarly hostile states in @entity68 or regions of @entity199 come to experience the groundbreaking transgender scene .			1

transgender performers and drag queens of @entity10 's @entity2 circus have audiences ranging from 400 people to nobody
clad in bikinis and stilettos , the 15 troupers take the act around the *traditionally* catholic country all year round
it is a haven for them as reports of gay people being attacked and killed still fill the nation 's newspapers
but as @entity10 and *neighbouring* countries bring in hate crime laws , underground @entity81 scene is gradually booming
