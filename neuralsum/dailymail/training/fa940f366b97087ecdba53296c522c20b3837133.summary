@entity1 scientists believe they have found evidence alien life after sending a balloon to the edge of space			1
the team of scientists sent a balloon 27km into the stratosphere and captured small biological organisms they say can only have come from space			1
the group , headed up by astrobiologist professor @entity12 , claims the ' seeds of life ' have been transported between planets by passing meteors			1
professor @entity12 is best known as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 @entity20 legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools			0
now he claims that plankton on the @entity25 came from outer space and not from @entity27 professor @entity12 , 74 , and his team from the @entity30 sent a specially designed balloon into the atmosphere above @entity33 during the annual @entity35 meteor shower			1
the balloon was carrying sterile microscope slides which were only exposed to the atmosphere at heights of 27km			2
when the balloon fell back down to @entity27 the scientists discovered microscopic aquatic algae on the microscope slides - which they say can only be alien life forms			1
professor @entity12 , 74 , and his team from the @entity30 sent a specially designed balloon into the atmoshphere during the annual @entity35 meteor shower last month in august their findings were published in a paper during the @entity47 , methods , and @entity50 conference in @entity51 , @entity52 , last month			2
prof @entity12 said : ' biological entities of this nature have not previously been reported occurring in the stratosphere			0
' the entities varied from a presumptive colony of ultra-small bacteria to two unusual individual organisms - part of a diatom frustule and a 200 micron - sized particle mass interlaced with biofilm and biological filaments			0
' he said these findings were evidence for the theory of ' cometary panspermia '			0
this states that the ' seeds of life ' exist all over the @entity72 and travel through space from one planet to another			1
the left image shows an unidentified ' alien ' biological complex organism with a segmented neck connected to a flask - shaped body			0
on the right collapsed ' alien ' organism with a ' proboscis ' - or head of the animal - with 2 nostril - like openings and a ' sphincter ' - like opening at the top when the balloon fell back down to @entity27 the scientists discovered microscopic aquatic algae on the microscope slides - which they say can only be alien life forms			1
an internal microscopic image of an alien mass of bacteria found is pictured above in a separate study , scientists have recently found never before seen material inside rock that crashed to @entity27 in @entity101 last year			2
the discovery comes from an analysis of the @entity105 meteorite , which lit up the @entity101 night sky with a dazzling fireball in april 2012			0
meteor fragments are rich in organic compounds – many of which are found in living organisms on @entity27 – and the newly discovered molecules could shed light on the origins of life on our planet			1
@entity119 , who undertook the study , claims the molecules likely formed several billion years ago in conditions similar to those on early @entity27			0
sceptics believe ' biological entities ' captured in the stratosphere could have been carried high into the atmosphere from @entity27 - and not from space			2
but prof @entity12 said : ' the biological entities found are particles of relatively large size and mass. ' by our current understanding of the means by which such particles can be transferred from @entity27 to the stratosphere they could not - in the absence of a violent volcanic eruption occurring within a day of the sampling event - make such a journey			1
' if there is no mechanism by which these biological entities could be elevated from @entity27 to the stratosphere then it must have arrived from above the stratosphere and have been incoming to @entity27			0
' the @entity150 - born @entity1 mathematician , astronomer and astrobiologist is one of the leading proponents of the theory of cometary panspermia			0
@entity156 is @entity157 for ' seeds everywhere '			0
the panspermia theory states that seeds of life can be spread through space from one location to another			1
and that life on @entity27 may have originated through this process			0
it requires meteors blasted from a planet ’s surface serve to act as transfer vehicles for spreading biological material from one planet to another .			2

scientists found algae after sending a balloon into the stratosphere
claim the algae could only have come from space or a volcanic eruption
this could *provide* evidence that the ' seeds of life ' exist all over the @entity72 and travel from one planet to another via meteors
