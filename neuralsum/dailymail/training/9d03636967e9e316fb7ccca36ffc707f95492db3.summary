men ’s and women ’s brains really are different			0
researchers say that if both sexes had access to the same levels of education , they ’d expect women to do best on tests of memory – and men to excel at maths			1
the prediction comes after an analysis of how the sexes ’ abilities varied across @entity17 across time			0
more than 31,000 men and women aged 50 - plus from 13 countries were put through three tests of brainpower			1
in northern @entity17 , women in their 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s outperformed men in the memory test ( file photo ) the test of numeracy involved being given five questions , such as working out how much a cut - price car would have cost when new , while the memory test involved trying to remember a list of ten words			1
the third test was of ‘ verbal fluency ’ – and involved naming as many different animals as possible in a minute			0
in northern @entity17 , women in their 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s consistently outperformed the men in the memory test			1
however , in southern @entity17 , where economic conditions were poorer for longer , the earliest born women did worse than the men			2
however , as education and living conditions improved , so did their performance and those born from around 1940 onwards beat their male counterparts			0
men came out top in the maths tests in all countries at all ages			2
the researchers said the patterns mean that if men and women had equal access to education , females should do better than men ( file photo ) however , the gap narrowed as conditions improved , the journal @entity67 reports			1
the researchers , from the @entity72 in @entity73 , said that women may benefit more than men from improvements in lifestyle because they were at a greater disadvantage to begin with			0
they said the patterns mean that if men and women had equal access to education , females should do better than men			2
men should still to slightly better than maths – and the sexes should do equally well in quick fire tests of vocabulary			1
it is thought the differing strengths can be explained by differences in the biology of the brain as well as in the way the sexes are treated by society .			0
