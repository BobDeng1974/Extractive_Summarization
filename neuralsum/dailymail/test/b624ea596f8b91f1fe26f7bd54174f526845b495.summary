@entity9 captain @entity0 is to switch codes and join @entity15 at the end of the season @entity22 head coach @entity21 , the man who made @entity24 captain at the age of 22 , trod the same path , although in a coaching capacity after losing the @entity9 top job in 2003 , and has a word of warning for his former team - mate			1
' it surprised me a little bit , ' @entity21 said			1
' it will be interesting to see if he can make a success of it but he 's been an outstanding player and captain within the sport and you would n't back against him			1
i think he 's been unbelievable in his career			2
' he wo n't need my advice			2
he knows what he 's doing			2
i 'm sure he will have done all his homework			2
@entity0 ( centre ) lifts the @entity46 trophy after @entity9 beat @entity47 in the grand final in october 2012 ' it 's certainly a challenge			1
you look at @entity52 and what he 's going through , and @entity55 - it 's tough			1
it 's not an easy thing to do			2
' the one thing you do have is a bit of a sign on you , on your head			2
you 're a bit of a target			0
' it 's a completely different sport			0
it will be interesting to see what position he 's going to play , but i wish him all the best			0
' @entity0 is tackled during a match between @entity9 and @entity70 last year @entity0 , who has guided the @entity9 to six @entity46 titles , three @entity72 and the @entity73 in 2014 at the expense of @entity21 's @entity22 , will be the second high - profile departure from @entity76 at the end of the year following @entity79 's appointment as @entity81 's new football manager			1
the former @entity83 winner is closing in on third place in rugby league 's all - time scoring list with 3,997 points , but @entity21 believes his old club have a ready - made replacement in 20 - year - old @entity90 , who has deputised for an injured @entity0 in the last two matches			1
' they 've got some really good young players , ' @entity21 said			0
' @entity94 has slotted in there and seems to be doing a good job			0
he looks like a mature young player who can handle things pretty much the way @entity100 did when he was a young fella			0
@entity0 ( left ) in action for @entity1 against @entity103 during the @entity105 quarter - final ' i was obviously at the back end of my career when @entity100 started and it looked like he was going to be an outstanding player			1
but i do n't think anyone could have foreseen how good he was going to be and how many things he would win and how much he would grow as a leader in the game			0
' @entity0 has been named in @entity9 ' 19 - man squad for friday 's derby at @entity22 , but coach @entity117 will not rush his skipper back			1
' i 'm not sure if he 's going to be fit for friday , ' @entity117 said			0
' what we have got to make sure when @entity121 does come back into the team is that he 's 100 per cent fit			0
' @entity90 's played really well in these last couple of games			0
he 's held his own and in some parts of the games has played really well			0
