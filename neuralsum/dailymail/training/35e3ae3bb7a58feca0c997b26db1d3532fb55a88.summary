@entity1 manager @entity0 will be at @entity2 to run a personal check on @entity5 striker @entity4 against @entity6			1
@entity0 is pondering whether to give the 21 - year - old his first call - up with @entity1 's next game a @entity10 qualifier on march 27 against @entity11			1
it is the @entity1 manager 's first game of 2015 and could also give him a chance to monitor @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity4 has been in sensational form for @entity5 - most recently netting a double against @entity21 @entity22 ( right ) celebrates with @entity4 ( centre ) after scoring their fifth goal against @entity21 @entity4 is after being named in the @entity1 squad following @entity0 's recent praise of the starlet			1
the @entity1 boss described @entity4 as having ' come on leaps and bounds ' after his two goals against @entity21 during @entity5 's 5 - 3 win at @entity34			1
@entity0 's selection , however , could have repercussions for @entity37 , the @entity38 manager , ahead of the @entity39 in june			2
' @entity4 is one of those players – @entity18 being another one – who did n't exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in , ' @entity0 told @entity43			2
' they got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade , if you like , or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade			0
after a stunning first half of the season @entity4 is now in line to make the step up to the @entity1 senior side @entity1 manager @entity0 described @entity5 's @entity4 as having ' come on leaps and bounds ' ' we have watched [ @entity4 ] for a while and i worked with him briefly in the under - 21s when i filled in for one game			1
@entity4 has come on in leaps and bounds and i 'm not surprised because i know [ former coaches ] @entity66 and @entity67 very well			0
' they have worked with him at @entity5 and they always believed in him as a goalscorer			0
it 's tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the under - 21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we did n't think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders			0
' and yet suddenly @entity4 , @entity79 and @entity80 are all doing exceptionally well			0
it will be a headache for @entity37 who he picks to play in the summer			0
