a gaping sinkhole has opened up in the @entity2 region of @entity3 after the flooding of a nearby potash mine			1
the sudden collapse led to the suspension work at @entity8 , owned by the world 's number one potash producer			1
the hole - described as being between 100 and 130ft in diameter - appeared several miles to the east of the mine in @entity2 region			1
disaster : around 1,300 miners have been told to stay away from the @entity18 mine in @entity3 after a 130ft wide sinkhole opened up gave way : some have theorised that an earthquake in the area 20 years ago may have weakened the rock , before mining and flooding caused it to subside geologists are urgently seeking to understand its cause			1
one theory is that an earthquake 20 years ago weakened the rock structure around the mine			1
some 1,300 miners were ordered to stay at home as an assessment is undertaken into the safety of the flooded shaft			1
workers in the mine were evacuated safely			1
the hole suddenly appeared several kilometres from the mine and is surrounded by ' dacha ' summer houses			1
no - one was living in the homes close to the sinkhole , but many in the area are now concerned over further craters appearing in the area , linked to the flooding			2
one local said : ' people have not slept for three days , waiting for new holes			2
' another stated : ' these are dacha houses in the pictures			2
they were empty when it happened , which was lucky			2
the nearest houses where people are living are two kilometres away			2
' this hole appeared because the waters broke into the mine and the soil collapsed ... there is almost panic in @entity18			1
' collapse : despite the ground around the mine giving way , all of the workers were safely evacuated huge loss : the @entity18 mine is owned by the world 's biggest producer of potash - a chemical compound used in fertiliser - and may have to close as a result a local estate agent said today residents were rushing to put their homes on the market after the sinkhole appeared on 18 november			1
' the number of people who wish to sell their flat in the @entity90 of the city increased three times , ' said @entity93 , head of @entity95 agency			0
' our town has two parts northern and southern			0
there is really some kind of panic among the people from the southern part			0
they are trying to sell their flats now and move to other regions			0
' however , he warned new buyers ' do not want to invest into districts with potential risk for their lives '			0
the area is close to a notorious area of @entity116 prisons in the @entity118 era			0
the flooding is a blow to fertiliser giant @entity121 , which is traded on the @entity123 and @entity124 stock exchanges			0
the company accepted there could be further ' subsidence ' , and linked the problems to an earlier mine flooding in 1995 , which some blame on an earthquake			1
@entity132 , @entity121 ceo , said : ' the accident is not catastrophic to the company 's operations or people living in the area			0
' the impact is being localised and we have a clear plan to tackle the situation promptly			0
' we will take all necessary measures to minimise the impact of the incident on the @entity145 , our investors , partners and the inhabitants of @entity149 and the surrounding area '			0
@entity149 - 2 mine is reported to have reserves of 150million tons amid fears that the mine will have to close			1
uncertain : one bank estimates that the company could lose nearly half of its productivity to the collapse , putting thousands of jobs at risk @entity162 , general director of the @entity163 of the @entity164 of the @entity165 , said : ' the site where the inflow of brine has been detected completely overlaps with the site of the incident which happened at @entity171 - 2 on 5 january 1995			1
' this enables us to conclude that the 1995 accident and its consequences are directly linked to the accident on 18 november 2014			0
' but he insisted : ' there is currently no threat to the surrounding populated areas			0
' the plant has an annual capacity of 2.3million tons of potash , a crop nutrient			1
' we estimate that up to 24 per cent of the company 's capacity might be affected , with another 20 per cent of capacity in geographical proximity to the flooded mine , ' said @entity192 investment bank			2
' we can not say that the mine is lost for the company , ' said @entity195 , the company 's deputy chairman			2
the cause of the sinkhole is seen as different to the appearance of craters in northern regions of @entity202 recently			0
the @entity202 craters - in permafrost regions - are seen as the result of the melting of soil containing gas hydrates , leading to dramatic blowouts .			0

despite the collapse miners made it out without any *injuries*
