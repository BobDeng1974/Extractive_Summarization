by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 18:15 est , 31 october 2013 an ambulance crew were caught parked in a disabled bay while the went on a shopping trip - despite their being numerous free other spaces			1
complaints were made after paramedics left their vehicle in a bay for blue - badge holders at @entity10 in @entity11			1
the two crew members hopped out of the ambulance to pop into @entity14 ’s shortly after 10am on tuesday - and emerged ten minutes later clutching shopping bags			1
an ambulance was caught parked in a disabled space so that they could go into a supermarket numerous free spaces were available at the time in the car park , which has space for 1,200 vehicles			1
it is understood that the on - duty paramedics were on a break at the time			2
now they have been branded ' selfish ' and ' lazy ' by @entity27 chair @entity26 , who says there was ' no excuse ' for their behaviour			1
she said today : ' these must be the two most selfish cads in @entity33			2
they have done a disabled person out of a space			2
' if they had a disabled relative would they be ok with people doing this ? ' a person using crutches , or in a wheelchair , may have come along to use that space while they went about their shopping			2
@entity10 has space for 1,200 vehicles , and there were numerous free bays available ' this is just the absolute height of laziness - they could n’t be bother walking the extra distance from a normal space			1
' i hope that strong disciplinary action is taken against them - this is unacceptable and inexcusable behaviour			0
' one 42 - year - old shopper , from @entity61 , who asked not to be named , said : ' i came out the door and could n’t believe what i was seeing			0
' the ambulance looked like it had been abandoned - it was then i realised it was parked in a disabled space as well			1
' i appreciate the job they do but it ca n’t be one rule for them and another for the rest of us			0
' they came back about ten minutes later carrying @entity14 ’s bags			0
' @entity10 manager @entity76 said : ' it has been brought to our attention that an ambulance was parked in a disabled bay in the centre car park and we are looking into this			1
' there are bays which are close to both entrances of the centre which are for the use of disabled or infirm customers and our staff monitor their use throughout the day			0
' a spokesman for the @entity94 said : ' crews remain available to respond to emergency calls for their entire shift and often take the opportunity to purchase food products for consumption whilst on their break			0
' they should always park with due consideration for others , whilst trying to minimise any delay in returning to the vehicle for response to a call should this be required			0
' we will address this matter internally			0
' earlier this month , @entity112 paramedic @entity111 was cleared of misconduct after she stopped to pick up her own medicine while responding to an urgent call .			0
