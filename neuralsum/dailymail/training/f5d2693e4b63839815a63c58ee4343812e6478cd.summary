striding out : the harness attaches around an adult 's waist to hold the child upright , they can then walk in step with their parent , as demonstrated by @entity70 and @entity22 ' when my son was two years old , i was told by medical professionals that " he did n't know what his legs are and has no consciousness of them "			1
' that was an incredibly difficult thing for a mother to hear			0
i started to walk him day after day , which was a very strenuous task for both of us			2
out of my pain and desperation came the idea for the @entity25 and i 'm delighted to see it come to fruition			0

it includes a harness for the child , which attaches to a belt worn by an adult , and specially - engineered sandals that allow the parent and child to step simultaneously , leaving their hands free for play and other tasks			1
