by @entity0 a heroic @entity2 pilot who helped defend @entity3 during the @entity4 has died before he was able to see his flying boat raised from the sea where it sank in 1940			1
wing commander @entity8 was the last person to fly the @entity10 aircraft before it sank during a fierce storm at the dock where it was based			1
after he helped historians identify the plane , they started to bring it up from the seabed - but the job was not finished by the time mr @entity20 died last month at the age of 93			1
he was an instructor at a training unit based in @entity23 , @entity24 when he last flew the @entity10 bomber in 1940 as part of his duties training young airmen			1
hero : wing commander @entity20 , pictured left in 1940 and right in recent years , has died aged 93 plane : mr @entity20 flew a @entity10 flying boat similar to this one during the @entity4 mr @entity20 later joined @entity32 in @entity33 , and was badly injured in a crash in 1941			1
he was treated by the renowned plastic surgeon @entity35 and became a member of the exclusive ' @entity37 ' , formed of patients who had undergone experimental procedures			2
in 1943 , mr @entity20 returned to flying duties at @entity23 and after the war remained in the @entity2 for some years , eventually settling in the @entity43 village of @entity44 with his wife @entity45			1
the @entity10 bomber was flown from @entity23 during the crucial @entity46 , which saw the @entity2 target @entity49 u-boats sinking @entity51 supply ships			1
the battle raged between 1940 and 1943 , killing 6,000 @entity2 crew who flew up to 600 miles into the @entity54 - but without their efforts , @entity3 might have been starved into submission by the submarines			1
mission : part of mr @entity20 's @entity10 has been retrieved from the water where it sank off @entity23 unfulfilled : the last surviving @entity10 has not yet been fully recovered ; one of the planes is pictured in its full glory during the @entity4 @entity67 wrote : ' the only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the @entity72 peril			1
' shortly before his death , mr @entity20 said : ' sunderlands were the only long range @entity3 aircraft which could reach the middle of the @entity54 for the first couple of years of the war			1
' we would fly out day and night to patrol around the convoys and protect them			0
' if you were lucky you would sink a submarine			0
but just by being there you could force submarines to submerge and not get in a position to torpedo our ships			0
' describing the day his aircraft sank , he said : ' i flew it on a routine flight around the dock and then moored it up			1
' there was a gale during the night and it must have been holed by some floating debris and down it went			0
in the morning it was n't there			0
well , it was - at the bottom of the sea			2
' discovery : a diver is pictured examining the remains of the plane deep under water found : a deep sea diver happened upon the plane after it had lain underwater for six decades the @entity10 flying boat was crucial to the war effort as it was deployed to tackle @entity113 u-boats in the @entity54			1
it was a military version of the @entity116 crafts used by @entity117 , with a deeper hull and turrets on the nose and tail			0
desperate to roll out the new model , the @entity122 filed an order in 1937 to strengthen defences			0
the first was received in @entity127 in june 1938			0
by the start of the war , they had a fleet of 40 , which acted as one of the major components of the @entity3 's overseas operations for at least the first few months			1
in total , 75 were built			0
initially , it carried 910kg of bombs , mines and other weaponry			0
a year into the war , amendments were made to combat @entity113 tactics			0
two @entity146 machine guns were attached to the wing , a second gun was added to the nose turret , and constant speed propellers and de-icing boots were installed			2
the plane was discovered by a deep sea diver in 2000 , after a lobster pot became snagged on its rusting remains			2
mr @entity20 was brought in to identify the @entity10 , which is now surrounded by a 100m exclusion zone while the work to retrieve it continues			1
@entity157 , who is running the conservation operation , said : ' @entity8 visited a number of times and was a tremendous support to us			0
' he piloted this plane and brought that incredible personal link with him - he would 've heard the engines roar into life all those years ago			2
' since the plane was first re-discovered around the millennium our volunteers have spent thousands of hours raising the plane in parts			2
' we have identified it as @entity171 of @entity172 , @entity2 , which sank at its moorings in a gale in november 1940			2
' much of it is covered in mud and sediment - which has preserved the structure and turned it into a perfect time capsule			0
' two of its massive @entity182 radial engines and propellers have been raised from the wreck and are now being conserved and displayed in our museum			0
' to raise it all is a massive undertaking but we intend to bring up as much as we can by the 75th anniversary of its sinking in 2015			0

wing commander @entity20 flew a @entity10 plane during the @entity46 which allowed @entity3 to survive
