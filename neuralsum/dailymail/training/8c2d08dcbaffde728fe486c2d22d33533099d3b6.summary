principal @entity0 refused two @entity2 women from completing their work placement at @entity4 in @entity5 a christian school principal has come under fire from parents and members of the public after he turned away two @entity2 women who wore hijabs on their first day as student teachers			1
people took to social media to express their disappointment at principal @entity0 's decision			1
@entity4 parent @entity18 wrote she was ' so very sad ' her daughter attended the school and her university sent student teachers there , @entity17 reported			0
others re-branded @entity4 as ' @entity25 ' and questioned mr @entity28 's @entity27 faith			2
' it â€™s not very " @entity27 like " for a @entity27 school to tell student teachers that they are not welcome to teach and learn because they wear a hijab , ' a reader wrote on the newspaper 's website			0
' shame on you @entity4			0
this could have been a very good way to show @entity27 love and acceptance			0
' the two @entity2 women were allocated positions to start their work placement at @entity4 , as they are in their final year of studying teaching at university			1
but mr @entity0 did n't allow the women to go ahead with their placement , and justified his decision in the college newsletter on tuesday , claiming he acted inside his duty of care , according to the paper			1
' i have a duty of care to ensure that those teaching at the college are actively supporting the @entity27 principles , practices and beliefs of the college , ' he wrote			1
he continued by writing that he viewed the wearing of the hijab to be in direct opposition to the principles which the college upholds			0
mr @entity0 said he respected the two women 's right to wear the hijab but felt it was inappropriate at his school , and had them transferred to another school to complete their placement			2
in a statement to the publication , @entity4 said that they were accepting and loving of all people from all cultures and religions			0
a statement from the @entity77 denied any wrongdoing and said they are not aware the student teachers had any opposition to being transferred ' we are not aware that they [ student teachers ] had any concerns , and it is our understanding that all parties came to a mutual agreement for the benefit of all , ' the school said			0
@entity90 also claimed that they would not hide their christian values and were there to provide for the families seeking a @entity27 education			2
a spokesperson for the school said that the decision had nothing to do with intolerance and they condemn any form of that behavior			0
the @entity105 community are disappointed with the decision while a @entity107 said it goes against fundamental @entity27 beliefs according to @entity110 of the anti-discrimination @entity111 , employers are allowed to enforce a ' genuine occupational requirement that workers act in a way that is consistent with the religious beliefs of the school '			1
however , the move has upset many , including the @entity2 community with the @entity122 principal saying the decision was a matter of great concern			2
reverend @entity126 told the @entity17 that he also disagreed with it , and that the actions are a direct contradiction of the foundations of @entity27 .			1

@entity4 in @entity132 had two women transferred for wearing *traditional* @entity2 *headwear* to placement
principal @entity0 claimed that it was within his duty of care to do so
reverend @entity126 says the decision is in direct *conflict* with fundamental @entity27 beliefs of tolerance
