the study also revealed that 18 per cent drink more than is safe before driving home from a night out			2
researchers from the @entity12 interviewed and breath - tested more than 1,000 party - goers at a bar in @entity15			1
concerning : a new study has found that more than one in three designated drivers have had a drink and most had blood - alcohol levels high enough to affect their driving they discovered that of all of the designated drivers who had consumed alcohol , half recorded a blood - alcohol level higher than .05 per cent which is a recently recommended new threshold for drunken driving in the @entity15 the researchers recruited volunteers as they left the bar between 10pm and 2.30am on six different friday nights			1
the average age of the participants was 28 , and most were white male college students			1
professor @entity34 , lead author of the study , said : ‘ if you look at how people choose their designated drivers , oftentimes they 're chosen by who is least drunk or who has successfully driven intoxicated in the past — successful meaning got home in one piece ... that 's disconcerting			0
’ results : half recorded a blood - alcohol level higher than .05 per cent which is a recently recommended new threshold for drink driving in the @entity15 professor @entity34 said he did n’t know why a designated driver would consume alcohol , but factors could include group dynamics or the driver ’s belief that one or two drinks wo n’t impair his skills if he is an experienced drinker			1
it was also tricky to measure your own sobriety after a drink , he said , adding : ‘ that ’s the insidious nature of alcohol - when you feel buzzed , you ’re drunk			2
’ at .08 per cent , the @entity15 and @entity66 currently have one of the highest allowable legal limits of any developed country			1
countries such as @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 use the .05 level , @entity75 and @entity76 are at .02 per cent and @entity77 has a zero tolerance policy			1
while most experts recommend that people who intend to drive do not drink anything , there are things you can do to reduce the amount of alcohol in your blood after drinking			2
dr @entity88 , a specialist addiction psychiatrist at the @entity91 practice , and at @entity92 and @entity93 in @entity94 said : ‘ roughly , you absorb about one unit of alcohol an hour , but drink after some food and the rate it enters your bloodstream is slowed			0
‘ food absorbs some of the alcohol , and while the gut is absorbing key nutrients from the food , it ’ll be far less efficient in absorbing the alcohol			0
’ despite having the same number of drinks , someone who starts on an empty stomach can have three times more alcohol in their blood compared with those who have eaten a small meal beforehand , he says : ‘ alternating alcoholic with soft drinks can also slow down the effects			2
’ male drivers are also able to consume more alcohol before they find themselves over the legal limit			0
dr @entity124 , a heptologist at @entity126 the @entity125 in @entity127 , @entity128 , explained that , as a general rule , if you ’re larger or male , your body can process alcohol faster			0
however , women also have the additional disadvantage that their bodies are made up of more fat and less water than men ’s - they carry 52 per cent water , compared to the 61 per cent in men			0
this means a man ’s body will automatically dilute the alcohol more than a woman ’s , even if they weigh the same			0
women also have less dehydrogenase , the liver enzyme that breaks down alcohol .			0
