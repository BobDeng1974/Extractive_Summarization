@entity0 hit @entity1 in the face and deserved to be sent off by top referee @entity3			1
striking or attempting to strike an opponent is viewed as violent conduct			1
of course , @entity1 ‘ made a meal of it ’ but that is the modern game			2
@entity3 had a clear view of @entity0 looking for his man before throwing his arm out at him in a violent way and was right to send him off			0
@entity3 is rated very highly by @entity13			0
his other key decision , turning down @entity17 ’s penalty appeal , was also spot on as the @entity19 goalkeeper got the ball at @entity17 ’s feet			1
@entity0 makes contact with the face of @entity1 during @entity25 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity19 @entity17 goes tumbling under a challenge from goalkeeper @entity27 in the second half chief sports writer @entity30 's take on the decision in his match report , reads : ' [ @entity0 was ] a victim of that fatal combination – his own stupidity and the spiteful cunning of an opponent			1
' @entity0 , who had looked lively out wide with @entity37 moved to @entity39 ’s role , was speeding away from @entity1 when , for reasons best known to himself , he decided to flick out an arm to keep him back			1
' if he touched the @entity19 man it was little more than a fingertip but he fell as if struck by sniper fire			0
@entity3 bought it , and @entity0 was shown a straight red card			1
he had local sympathy but , let ’s face it , if @entity51 had done that he would have been castigated for impetuous foolishness			0

' i thought the sending off was really disappointing decision by the referee , ' said @entity61			2
' @entity0 gets sent off for that , his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction			0

i will not contest what @entity61 says			0
