by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 18 june 2013 the @entity1 have a reputation for enjoying a drink or two - partly due to tv characters such as @entity6 's @entity5 and the pub regulars in mrs @entity8			1
now , a study of students has confirmed what many have believed all along - that those from the @entity13 do drink more than their international counterparts			1
the study , from @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , pins the blame on family drinking habits , same - sex schools and even if there 's a cricket club nearby			1
a map by researchers from the @entity16 shows how much the average @entity1 student drinks a year , by county			1
students from counties shown in blue drink in excess of 351 units of alcohol a year			2
students in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 drink the least per year - between 200 and 250 units each support is growing for the introduction of drink - driving permits on rural @entity1 roads as a second council is set to hear a motion on the proposal			1
councillors in @entity46 already backed a change in the law that would allow drinkers in rural areas to drive after having ' two or three drinks '			0
but despite widespread criticism of the proposal , originally put forward by pub owner and independent councillor @entity55 , a councillor in another county has expressed support			0
@entity59 councillor @entity58 said in january he would raise the idea at the next sitting of his council 's policy committee			0
he disagreed that more lax rules would lead to more road deaths , saying : ' we do n't want to see people drunk , we 're only talking about up to three pints			0
' researchers asked 3,500 students - with an average age of 21 - about their alcohol consumption			1
the research provided a fascinating insight into how the culture of the country affected drinking			0
boys who attended same - sex schools or boarding schools also drank more in college , according to this study , than boys who attended mixed - sex establishments			1
how much a student 's siblings drink also played a part , and affected male and female students equally			2
geographically , the researchers found that towns with a higher population of @entity92 drank less , on average , than towns with either a dominant @entity95 community or towns with no strong religious following			1
for example , towns where more masses took place per week raised students who drank less			2
and counties in which the legalisation of divorce was supported during the 1996 referendum - a move that was opposed by the @entity92 - had higher drinking levels			1
the research also found that people who lived in towns that had a cricket club drank more than other @entity1 towns			1
participants were also asked questions about their family background and where they grew up , so the researchers could compare domestic and geographical influences			0
respondents were then asked about the drinking habits of mothers and fathers and for each sibling over age 16 , plus the town in which they lived at age 10 and the secondary school they attended			0
according to research from @entity16 , @entity1 students drink more than their international counterparts			1
one in seven of the 3,500 @entity1 students questioned said they drank at least two drinks a day , while only five per cent said they did n't drink at all characters such as father @entity5 , played by @entity137 @entity136 ( pictured ) and renowned for repeatedly shouting for a ' drink ' during the show have fueled the stereotype that @entity1 people like to drink alcohol the researchers found that students from the @entity1 drank more , on average , than international students from the @entity146 and @entity147 - compared to previous studies on drinking habits from those regions			1
they were then able to create a map showing the annual volume of alcoholic drinking by @entity1 students broken down by county			2
of the 3,500 people asked , five percent of them did not drink at all while one in seven consumed , on average , more than two drinks every day			2
in general , drinking concentrated on a few days per week of very heavy drinking			0
for example , eight percent of students drank 10 or more drinks on the occasions that they consumed alcohol , while one in five drank between seven and nine drinks each time they consumed alcohol			2
while their parents ' education , age , marital status and income played little part in determining how much they drank , if their parents - especially their mothers - drank , they did too			2
a father 's drinking , on the other hand , only influenced the drinking habits of sons			0
the study said : ' we find that drinking of mothers significantly impacts the number of drinks consumed by both female and male students about equally			0
' but drinking of fathers appears only to influence drinking of their college - attending sons			0
' the researchers claimed this was because cricket is an @entity199 import and places that had a strong @entity199 cultural influence drank more			1
the research team also checked whether the average rainfall and temperature of a region played a part in the amount its residents drank , yet they could find no evidence to suggest this			0
@entity1 cricketers celebrate taking the last wicket of @entity213 during the 2007 @entity214			0
research from @entity16 discovered that students who lived in towns with a cricket club drank more			1
the study claimed this was because cricket is an @entity199 import and places with a strong @entity199 cultural influence drank more commenting on the research , @entity225 said : ' this is a nice study , although it does suffer from being a student sample and purely self - report			2
it ’s also a useful reminder of the importance of not confusing correlation with causation			0
living near a cricket club clearly does n’t cause anyone to drink more			1
it ’s a marker for other cultural factors , no less real , but hard to measure directly			0
but it is easy to forget this , to see only the tangible tip of the iceberg and overlook the true causes beneath the surface			0

researchers from the @entity16 discovered that , on average , students in @entity1 drink more than their international counterparts
they found that students who had parents and siblings that drank were more likely to drink to excess at college
boys who go to same - sex schools and students who live in towns with a cricket club also drink more
towns with a higher population of @entity92 drank less than towns with either a dominant @entity95 community or no strong religious link
