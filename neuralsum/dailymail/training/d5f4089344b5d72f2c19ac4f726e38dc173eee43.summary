@entity0 became the joint third highest scorer in @entity4 ’s history on sunday night with his 290th goal for the club in a 2 - 0 win over @entity8			1
the victory put real four points clear of @entity11 who slipped up 24 hours earlier against @entity13 and it also moved @entity0 up another notch on @entity4 ’s all - time goals list			1
across almost two decades @entity17 international striker @entity16 scored 290 goals in 645 games from his debut in 1971			1
@entity0 clenches his fist in celebration after scoring @entity4 's second goal of the night against @entity8 @entity8 players look on with frustration after @entity26 was found with the simplest of tasks to tap home into an empty net to make it 1 - 0 @entity26 expresses his delight after giving the @entity33 giants the lead against relegation - threatened @entity8 the forward duo celebrate after the @entity37 striker ( left ) scored the opening goal for @entity4 against @entity8 on sunday night @entity39 took charge of his 100th competitive match of @entity4 in the 2 - 0 win against @entity8 @entity8 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 81 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 75 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 64 ) ; @entity55 ; @entity56			1

@entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity62 ; @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ; @entity67 ( @entity68 84 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 89 ) ; @entity72 , @entity26 ( @entity73 93 ) , @entity0			1
subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 scorers : @entity26 56 , @entity0 69 it has taken @entity0 just 281 games to match that total and he is now only 15 goals from second placed top scorer @entity84 and 33 behind all - time leader @entity85			1
all that after coming into the game on a run of three league games without a goal – he has never gone four matches without scoring since joining the club and that record stays in tact			0
he had four chances inside the first 20 minutes			0
he almost scored after just five minutes when from @entity26 ’s pass he hit the @entity8 bar			1
he then had a shot from the edge of the area that @entity43 saved			0
that was followed by a long crossfield pass from @entity66 which he pulled back across the face of the goal instead of sending goalwards			0
and then on 19 minutes came the best chance of the half			0
@entity72 crossed from the right and inexplicably @entity0 directed his effort back away from goal			2
on another day he would have had a first half hat - trick			2
the last opportunity of the four owed everything to @entity72 , so much for the selfish former @entity113 forward			0
he was causing @entity8 problems down their left and @entity47 was booked for upending him			2
@entity26 went one better than @entity0 shortly before the break when he did put the ball in the net but the linesman ’s flag cruelly ruled it out			1
@entity72 was again the architect crossing from the right			0
@entity26 connected brilliantly with an overhead kick that gave @entity43 no chance but despite appearing to be level with the last defender he was penalised for offside			2
@entity39 ( left ) and star man @entity0 ( right ) show their delight after @entity4 scored their second goal of the evening @entity62 applauds the travelling supporters on what was his 500th @entity135 appearance for @entity4 on sunday night @entity0 - who has now scored seven goals in his last three games against elche - gestures to @entity8 keeper @entity43 the 30 - year - old goes down clutching his face after going in for a challenge during the opening period the @entity144 star attempts to guide a shot into the back of the net from a narrow angle for @entity4 - but the ball ended up well wide @entity26 ( right ) looks to get hold of the ball during the first half of the @entity135 clash for the league leaders the 27 - year - old 's ( left ) superb bicycle kick was ruled out for offside in the first half 1			1
@entity85 - 323 goals 2			2
@entity84 - 305 goals 3			2
ronaldo - 290 goals with @entity4 unable to get themselves in front having dominated the first half @entity8 came out with plenty of self - belief for the second period			1
@entity62 – making his 500th @entity135 appearance for @entity4 – palmed away @entity53 ’s shot			1
the midfielder ’s next contribution to the game should have been his last			0
he went through @entity72 with a red card challenge on the @entity174 ’s ankle that merited far more than the yellow card he was shown			0
both feet were off the ground , the studs were up and @entity72 was lucky to be able to carry on			0
with the referee letting off @entity53 and @entity26 ’s brilliance denied its reward in the first half it seemed the luck was against @entity4 but on minute 56 thing fell the way of @entity39 ’s team at last			1
@entity187 ( left ) fires an attempt on goal for @entity4 during a below - par first - half showing from @entity39 's men @entity72 's shot fails to trouble @entity194 keeper @entity43 - on a season - long loan from @entity196 - as the hosts held out during a goalless first half @entity85 ( 1994 - 2010 ) 323 goals 741 appearances @entity84 ( 1953 - 1964 ) 305 goals 392 appearances @entity0 ( 2009 - present ) 290 goals 281 appearances @entity16 ( 1971 - 1988 ) 289 goals 645 appearances @entity203 ( 1958 - 1966 ) 242 goals 262 appearances @entity0 ’s cross was intercepted by former @entity207 defender @entity206 but he cleared it straight at keeper @entity43 and it run into the path of @entity26 who swept it over the line from close range			1
it was no more than he and @entity4 deserved			0
the goal relaxed @entity4 but not @entity0 who missed another chance this time from a @entity72 pass			1
could he really go four league games without a goal ? he answered the question emphatically on 69 minutes to put the game beyond doubt			0
@entity70 ran on to @entity66 ’s pass and skipped past @entity44 before planting a cross on @entity0 ’s head			0
there was still work for @entity4 ’s top scorer to do but with a bullet header he gave @entity43 no chance			2
he might have scored a second a minute later but was wrestled to the ground by @entity231 who also escaped with a yellow card			0
@entity8 somehow had finished with 11 men on the pitch but had been beaten none the less			0
@entity39 once said that having @entity0 on the pitch was like starting one goal in front			2
the @entity240 coach had picked up three points on his 100th game in charge of @entity4 , his record breaking striker had made sure of it			1
@entity0 ( left ) vents out his frustration during a goalless first half at the @entity248 @entity4 duo @entity70 ( left ) and @entity65 ( right ) both win aerial duals in the first half for @entity4			1

@entity4 went four points clear at the top of @entity135 with a 2 - 0 win at @entity8 on sunday night
second - half goals from @entity26 and @entity0 were enough to assure the hosts of victory
as a result @entity144 forward @entity0 has now scored 290 goals for @entity4
@entity39 was taking charge of his 100th competitive match for the @entity33 giants
@entity62 kept a clean sheet on his 500th @entity135 appearance for the club
