by @entity0 published : 01:07 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 08:20 est , 26 april 2012 @entity2 authorities say they remain concerned over a possible ‘ lone wolf ’ attack on the one - year anniversary of @entity6 ’s death			1
while there are no concrete threats in retaliation for the @entity14 leader ’s death on may 1 last year , the @entity8 warns against possible solo attacks against the country and its citizens			0
these attacks are often carried out in the name of a terrorist organisation , but are committed by only one person			0
on alert : the @entity23 issued a warning over a possible ' lone wolf ' attack on the upcoming anniversary of @entity6 's death ( file photo ) patrolling : the homeland defence secretary warned last week that a terrorist could target a train or subway , like those in @entity35 ( file photo ) in a bulletin issued late wednesday night , the @entity37 and @entity8 issued warnings of possible retaliations from @entity14 , the @entity42 @entity41 , as well as @entity44 terrorist group @entity43			1
@entity6 was killed during a @entity46 raid on may 1 , 2011 all three have called for revenge in the may 1 , 2011 death of @entity6			1
all three terrorist networks would consider an attack on the anniversary of @entity6 ’s death a ‘ symbolic victory , ’ @entity55 reported			1
the bulletin also detailed terrorists ’ fixations with launching attacks on symbolic dates			0
in testimony given earlier this week , a @entity62 man who trained to be a shoe bomber a decade ago said @entity6 told him after the september 11 terrorist attacks that he hoped more attacks would follow			2
speaking at @entity69 last week , secretary of homeland security @entity67 reinforced the need for vigilance , saying : ‘ we ’re on guard against dangerous individuals or groups who would use violence , often on behalf of a grievance			0
‘ we ’re on guard against dangerous individuals or groups who would use employment to gain access to public places like airports , malls , and train stations , or sensitive infrastructure like water treatment , chemical , or energy plants			0
’ she also warned of possible cyberspace threats , but did not elaborate on any known plots.the anniversary of @entity6 's killing presents an election - year challenge for president @entity96 and his @entity98 opponents			1
mr @entity96 is expected to acknowledge the may 1 anniversary of the daring @entity46 raid on @entity6 's @entity42 compound			1
but he will not overdo it , a senior @entity103 official said , reflecting perhaps the dangers of hyping an event that speaks for itself - and is still controversial , particularly among @entity42 who saw the @entity2 attack as a violation of their country 's sovereignty			0
looking on : president @entity96 , vice president @entity113 , secretary of state @entity114 and members of the national security team receive an update on the mission against @entity6 in the @entity119 may 1 republicans , especially presumptive @entity98 presidential nominee @entity121 , must decide if the occasion is an opportunity to attack mr @entity96 's foreign policy record - or talk about something else			1
national security has not been a major theme in a 2012 campaign dominated by economic worries , but that could change - at least temporarily - in the days ahead			0
on thursday , vice president @entity113 will use a @entity35 speech to contrast mr @entity96 's foreign policy record with what the president 's partisans see as @entity121 's inexperienced rhetoric			2
mr @entity113 will inevitably recall @entity6 's demise and other successes against @entity14 over the last three years			2
in a hastily called speech from the @entity103 on may 1 , @entity96 said @entity2 special forces had killed @entity6 in his compound near @entity141			1
the @entity2 had not informed the @entity42 government before launching the raid , which took place before dawn local time on may 2			0
the killing of @entity6 , who was behind the september 11 , 2001 , attacks in @entity35 , @entity149 and @entity150 , sent @entity2 into the street in late - night celebrations and revived the image of a country that would find its enemies - even if it took a decade			2
then : mr @entity96 listened to updates during the @entity46 raid in @entity42 for mr @entity96 , ' this is a moment to be presidential and not worry so much about the campaign , ' @entity159 , a professor of government at @entity161 , told @entity164			2
' the emphasis is that @entity2 will avenge itself , and we do take action when we are attacked			0
not to be gloating , but to be strong			0
' a senior @entity103 official said that in addressing the anniversary , @entity96 ' will give credit where credit is due , ' in a nod to the work done by the administration of @entity98 president @entity175 to track @entity6 down , as well as the @entity2 forces who carried out the mission			1
@entity6 's killing in a compound just a few hours drive from @entity141 was a severe embarrassment to @entity42 , worsening relations with @entity149 and fanning anti-american sentiment in the country			2
analysts acknowledged the anniversary had an unavoidable resonance on the @entity2 campaign trail , but cautioned that glorifying @entity6 's killing may not serve @entity2 interests in @entity192 and @entity193 countries			1
' it 's a difficult minefield given @entity42 sensitivities and continued questions about @entity14 's @entity42 support network , ' said @entity198 , a former @entity199 analyst who has advised @entity96 on counter-terrorism issues .			0
