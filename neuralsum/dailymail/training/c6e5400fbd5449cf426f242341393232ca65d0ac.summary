a mysterious white spot glowing on the surface of @entity2 has baffled scientists , who are closing in on the dwarf planet			1
the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images of the icy world as the @entity8 prepares itself for a rendezvous on march 6			1
while @entity11 has not provided an explanation , scientists suggest it may be a frozen pool of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflects light			1
' we know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet @entity2			1
now , @entity8 is ready to change that , ' @entity23 added			0
this most recent images from @entity8 showing the white blotch were taken january 13 at a distance of 238,000 miles ( 383,000 km )			1
while these latest images from @entity8 are n’t quite as sharp as @entity45 ’s images from january 2004 , @entity11 says they will be very soon , and could help resolve the mystery			1
as the @entity8 spacecraft closes in on @entity2 , new images have emerged showing the solar system 's largest asteroid at 27 pixels across - three times better than the images taken in early december			2
this gif shows bright and dark features this is a raw image , taken january 13 , 2015			2
@entity2 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			0
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second on the left is a processed image , taken january 13			1
it hints at craters on the surface of @entity2			0
@entity8 's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles ( 383,000km ) from @entity2			1
on the right , is a zoomed - in raw image the dwarf planet is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			2
observations by the @entity76 's @entity75 suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes			0
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' said @entity23			0
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity2 has held since the dawn of the solar system			0
' @entity2 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity89 and @entity90 and is very similar to @entity90 's @entity91 and @entity93 's @entity92 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			1
@entity2 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			0
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			2
the long exposure made @entity2 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity2 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity8 will be captured into @entity2 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity2 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface @entity2 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity2 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			1
scientists think @entity2 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity133 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity11 's @entity8 has been making its way to @entity2 from the asteroid @entity140 since september 2012			2
it is due to land next year			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity2 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			0
dr @entity151 , of the @entity76 's lab in @entity153 in @entity154 said : ' although ground and space - based observations may further map the behaviour of @entity2 over its orbit the @entity8 spacecraft mission arriving to orbit @entity2 in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long - term follow - up on the water outgassing behaviour of @entity2			1
' the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity2 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity133 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity90			2
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity133 and @entity180 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity133			0
@entity2 is twice the size of @entity93 's geyser - spouting moon @entity183 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity133 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity8 has already visited @entity140 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity2			2
the distance between @entity140 and @entity2 is greater than the distance between the @entity133 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity140 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			2
@entity140 and @entity2 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt			0
the image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before @entity8 's arrival			0
on december 1 , @entity2 was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration @entity8 has orbited one member of the main asteroid belt , @entity140 , and is now heading to explore a second new world , dwarf planet @entity2			1

alien mark can be clearly seen in the latest images @entity2 as the @entity8 prepares to enter its orbit
one theory is that it is a frozen pool of ice at bottom of a crater which is clear enough to reflect sunlight
ceres dwarf planet orbits the sun between @entity89 and @entity90 , and may have water gushing from its surface
latest image was taken on january 13 from a distance of 238,000 miles ( 383,000km ) from the dwarf planet
