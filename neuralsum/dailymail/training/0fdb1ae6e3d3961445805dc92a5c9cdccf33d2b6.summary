governors have been told to defy a 70 - year - old law which says state schools must hold daily @entity4 assemblies because it is ' meaningless ' in today 's society			1
in a landmark move , the @entity6 said many non-faith schools are already ignoring the law because teachers are ' unable or unwilling ' to lead group worship			1
the organisation , which represents more than 300,000 school governors in @entity14 , added : ' schools are not places of worship , but places of education			0
' @entity20 law : @entity4 worship has been compulsory in state schools since 1944 ( pictured : assembly in 1962 ) the move was welcomed by the @entity25 , whose leaders include the atheist scientist professor @entity29 and the philosopher @entity30			1
the @entity6 had already moved towards banning @entity4 assemblies in non-faith schools four years ago , when it said they should no longer be compulsory			1
now its policy committee says they should be abolished completely			0
it announced in a newsletter to members : ' few schools can or do meet the current legislative requirement for a daily act of collective worship , partly because there is n’t space in most schools to gather students together , and often staff are unable or unwilling to lead a collective worship session			1
' there is also the added issue that worship implies belief in a particular faith – if the ' act of worship ' is not in your faith then it is meaningless as an act of worship			0
support : the move was welcomed by the @entity25 , whose leaders include @entity29 ' the view was taken that schools are not places of worship , but places of education , and expecting the worship of a religion or religions in all schools should not be a compulsory part of education in @entity14 today			1
' this is different in schools with a religious character – as faith schools are termed in the legislation – where parents have chosen to send their child in the knowledge that the particular faith and its worship is at the core of the ethos of the school			2
' removing the collective worship from the remit of schools that are not faith schools would not prevent them from holding assemblies that address a whole range of topics , including faith and belief			0
' in addition , it does not alter our position on religious education ; it is important that students should continue to be taught a broad and balanced curriculum that encourages a knowledge and understanding of all faiths			0
' faith schools , private schools and schools in @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 will not be affected			0
the @entity114 made it a legal requirement for all @entity117 state schools to ' provide a daily act of collective worship ' for all pupils , unless their parents object			1
the only significant change to the law has been the @entity125 - but that only removed a requirement for worship to take place ' at the start of the school day '			2
assemblies must still be ' wholly or mainly of a broadly @entity4 character ' , and head teachers must apply to their local council to allow @entity137 pupils to skip them			2
the @entity6 said it is consulting with the @entity138 to change the law , which still remains in force			2
historic move : governors have been told to ignore a 70 - year - old law which says @entity117 state schools must hold daily @entity4 assemblies because it is ' meaningless ' in today 's modern , multicultural society ( file photo ) the change was welcomed by the @entity25 , which campaigns to keep church and state separate			1
chief executive @entity151 said : ' the continued operation of this 70 - year - old law requiring daily @entity4 worship in schools is widely opposed			1
' teachers do n’t want it , parents do n’t want it , pupils do n’t want it , and according to opinion polls , 60 per cent of the public do n’t want it			2
' children as young as four are coming home and telling their non-religious parents they believe in @entity169 , or being distressed at age - inappropriate tales about hell			2
' worship may be the only place in our over regulated schools where the tyranny of @entity177 and constant assessment can for 15 minutes be forgotten ' - @entity14 ' in a plural and fair - minded society that cares about children and their development , schools should be holding inclusive assemblies that forward the spiritual , moral , social and cultural development of all pupils and staff , regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs			1
' the announcement comes in the wake of comments by education secretary @entity191 that all schools should adhere to ' @entity194 values '			0
and it was criticised today by the @entity14 , which said @entity4 assemblies were about community and shared experience , not just praising @entity169			0
the @entity199 , the @entity14 ’s chief education officer , said : ' the unique contribution of worship in church schools is to involve pupils in a shared experience of reflection and silence , singing and story framed with reference to @entity4 and other religious traditions			0
' it takes its place as part of the religious and spiritual education of the pupils , but with a far greater range of possibilities than a lesson leading to well - scripted outcomes			0
' worship may be the only place in our over regulated schools where the tyranny of @entity177 and constant assessment can for 15 minutes be forgotten and real engagement take place			0

@entity6 told members to defy a 70 - year - old law
it affects non-religious @entity117 state schools where many ' unwilling ' to pray
@entity6 claimed many schools were already shunning the law anyway
@entity25 : ' teachers , parents and pupils do *n't* want it '
