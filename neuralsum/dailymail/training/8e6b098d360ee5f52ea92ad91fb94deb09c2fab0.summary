the divorced mother - of - two who famously lost custody of her children because she had an abortion has now been ordered to return thousands in child support			1
@entity6 , 38 , was ordered by a judge to return $ 50,000 to @entity9 banker @entity8 - her ex-husband			1
he was also relieved of all obligations to pay further child support to the tune of $ 5,000 a month			1
the decision comes after she admitted to having sex with a friend one year after her five year marriage to @entity8 , 59 , came to an end in 2011 - the fling resulted in her being pregnant and having an abortion			2
her husband used the abortion against her in court to increase his custody prospects			0
shocked : @entity6 is in disbelief she has to pay back $ 50,000 in child support and will no longer receive payments from ex-husband @entity8 @entity6 was ' shocked ' at the latest ruling and said she may lose her @entity33 apartment , the @entity30 reported			1
a final decision in custody over the couple 's children is imminent , @entity8 currently has temporary custody			1
thursday 's decision is the latest in a series of court hearings , the mother - of - two says have left her feeling ' raped and beaten			0
' speaking to the @entity45 , she said : ' i ’m divorced			0
i ’m not @entity47 ! i feel like i ’ve been beaten up and raped			0
' i had sex with someone i knew for 20 years , and i ’m somehow this terrible , bad parent ! ' @entity6 lost temporary custody of her daughter @entity51 , six , and son @entity52 , four , in august			1
she now only sees her children on mondays and alternate weekends			0
' it just breaks my heart			0
they 're so confused , ' she said			0
devastated : @entity6 fears she may lose custody of her two children because her ex is using her abortion - which she had nearly a year after their divorce - as evidence against her in court mr @entity8 , 59 , and his ' relentless ' attorney @entity66 even went so far as to suggest that mrs @entity6 ' abortion undermined her claim of being a @entity69 , which in turn speaks to her overall credibility			1
after subpoenaing mrs @entity6 ' medical records to show that she indeed had an abortion , ms @entity66 used the procedure to suggest she was a hypocrite for asking to have custody of her two children over @entity77			1
the lawyer - who referred to the abortion in court as ' late ' , even though it was done during the first trimester - also argued that the procedure undermined mrs @entity6 ' testimony that she had never had other men over to her house			2
mrs @entity6 ' lawyers asserted , however , that she ' never testified that she did n’t go out on a date with another man , or she did n’t go to another man ’s apartment			2
' they added that on the rare occasions when she did leave the house , she would leave her two children , then two and four , in the care of her mother			0
judge @entity98 openly sided with mr @entity8 , saying in court that the abortion is ' relevant ' , a ruling that left mrs @entity6 ' completely shocked '			1
both slinging mud : @entity8 , 59 ( left ) and his ' relentless ' attorney @entity66 have claimed that mrs @entity6 ' abortion undermines her claim of being a @entity69 - she claims he paid for sex in massage parlors and beat her even more shocking to her was the ' double standard ' used in the trial ; while the judge ruled her abortion as relevant to the case , mr @entity8 ' sexual behavior - ie the fact that he had paid for sex at massage parlors - was ruled irrelevant			1
attorney @entity116 , a recent addition to mrs @entity6 ' legal team , had asked that @entity98 recuse herself because she had shown ' repeatedly ' that ' the court has made up its mind about the case , ' and that mrs @entity6 can expect to lose , but the judge has remained			2
' the idea of using an abortion against a woman in a custody case sets women 's rights back ' she has also pointed out the ethical issues in allowing the abortion as evidence , stating : ' the very idea of			0
using against a woman in a custody case the fact that she may have had an abortion sets women 's rights and the rights of choice back in a way that i ca n’t imagine this @entity140 would want to be associated			0
' it 's not the first time the couple have made headlines for a court appearance			0
mr @entity8 was arrested last year and accused of battering his wife , charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed her black eye was from a @entity152 injection , not physical violence - a claim @entity155 called ' ridiculous ' .			2

@entity6 , 38 , has been ordered to return 10 months worth of child support to ex-husband @entity8
@entity159 has also been relieved of obligations to pay $ 5,000 a month in child support in the *future*
the ex-husband currently has temporary custody of their children with a final ruling expected soon
