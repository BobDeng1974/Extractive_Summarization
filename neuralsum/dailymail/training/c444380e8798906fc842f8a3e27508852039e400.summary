by @entity1 reporter published : 04:51 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 05:00 est , 3 may 2013 a dying , paralyzed shooting victim who could n't speak , intentionally blinked his eyes to identify a photo of his attacker for authorities , prosecutors have said in the opening statements of the suspect 's murder trial			1
@entity13 lawyers in the trial of alleged killer @entity15 say blinking can not be considered consistent , reliable evidence			1
over the next few weeks , jurors will be asked to decide whether @entity15 killed @entity19 , of @entity20			1
incident : @entity19 , left , identified , 34 - year - old @entity15 ( right ) , who has now been charged with murder , felonious assault and weapons counts and faces up to life in prison if convicted paralyzed and hooked up to a ventilator , @entity19 was two weeks from death when police arrived at his hospital room to question him about the person who shot him			1
they wanted to know if he could identify a suspect , and they had a photo to show him			0
@entity19 was unable to communicate except with his eyes as he lay in bed attached to myriad tubes and with a brace around his neck			2
his eyes opened barely more than a slit at times ; he was instructed to blink three times for yes and twice for no. one detective quizzed him , and another videotaped his responses			0
@entity19 did n't respond with blinks to every question in the 17 - minute video , and there were solo blinks			2
but triple blinks came in response to repeated questions asking if he knew the shooter and whether the person in the photo was the culprit			0
legal experts say such cases - while not unheard of - are unusual , and dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or differing interpretations			0
but some have been used in murder cases around the country that have ended in convictions			0
suspect : @entity15 is led out of the courtroom last year after the murder trial was postponed police asked @entity19 to blink three times for yes and twice for no to a series of questions in the interview , said assistant @entity81 prosecutor @entity80			1
@entity19 also blinked yes to indicate that he knew the gunman and that his name began with the letter @entity87 , @entity80 said			2
@entity87 was a street name that @entity15 sometimes used , the prosecutor said			2
@entity80 told jurors that when they view the video , they will clearly see that @entity19 knew what he was doing			2
' you are going to see how he was struggling to get it right , ' @entity80 said			0
the motive for the shooting , the prosecutor said , was that @entity19 owed @entity15 money for drugs			1
@entity19 was a drug user who had bought drugs many times from @entity101 but had gone to an area near @entity15 ' home the night of the shooting with two friends to buy drugs from someone else			1
@entity19 was shot about 20 yards from @entity15 ' home and in an area known for drug deals , he said			1
familiar : @entity15 reportedly knew the victim through drug deals @entity80 said that while neither of the men in the car with @entity19 could clearly identify the man who shot him , one heard a voice yelling @entity19 's name			1
defense attorney @entity119 insisted that @entity15 did not shoot @entity19 and is ' an innocent man who found himself in a perfect storm of misinformation and misidentification '			1
@entity119 said @entity19 had stolen drugs from dealers previously			2
' he had many enemies , ' @entity119 said of @entity19			2
he had received threats and was considered a ' snitch ' who informed on drug dealers to police , according to @entity132			0
police decided before their investigation was completed that @entity15 was the shooter and never followed up on any other leads , @entity119 said			0
@entity119 also focused on the blinking identification , saying that while doctors were able to establish a ' rudimentary ' communication system with @entity19 , ' his blinks were inconsistent and sporadic '			1
law : judge @entity142 of @entity143 ruled at an earlier hearing that jurors could see the videotape , saying she found the blinks reliable he only blinked in response to doctors ' commands about 50 percent of the time , she said			0
both sides are expected to call medical experts to testify about the ability of someone in @entity15 ' condition to understand and respond to questions			0
other witnesses expected to be called include a priest who was a friend to @entity19 and gave him money before the shooting , @entity80 said			0
a man who was in jail with @entity101 will testify that @entity15 told him that he did n't mean to kill @entity165 but that he was angry that @entity19 owed him money for drugs and was trying to buy drugs from someone else , @entity80 said			1
the judge has said that the trial could take up to three weeks			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity19 was left paralysed after he was shot and could only communicate by blinking
defense lawyers for @entity15 say information *gleamed* from a dying man 's blinks can not be considered reliable
