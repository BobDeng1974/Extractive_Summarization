imagine the scene : you ’ve just embarked on your mission to @entity3 and , for your first meal of a several - months long journey , you ’ve got a rather unappetising plate of beetle larvae			1
this , rather unappealingly , is a scenario @entity10 scientists say could be the future of space exploration			2
they claim mealworms are high in protein and are ideal for long space trips , and to prove it they shut three volunteers away for 105 days and placed them on a diet of just larvae and plants			1
captain @entity24 ( centre ) and crew members @entity23 ( right ) and @entity27 ( left ) of the ' @entity29 ' pose for photos in front of the chamber for cultivating plants after living in the closed lab for 105 days on 20 may 2014 in @entity34 , @entity10 the volunteers , one man and two women , lived inside an enclosed biosphere at the @entity39			1
15 october 2003 @entity10 became the third nation to send a human into space when @entity43 orbited the @entity44 aboard @entity45			0
12 october 2005 @entity10 ’s second manned mission saw two taikonauts orbit @entity44 for five days			0
25 september 2008 three taikonauts travelled to space on @entity10 ’s third manned mission , with @entity51 performing @entity10 ’s first ever spacewalk			0
16 june 2012 @entity53 became @entity10 ’s first woman in space in june 2012 , and also took part in the mission that docked with the space laboratory @entity58 for the first time			0
11 june 2013 @entity10 ’s most recent space mission was @entity61 10 almost a year ago			0
they have big plans in future , though , including building a fully operational space station in @entity44 orbit and sending humans to the moon			0
known as @entity69 , the biosphere is 1,700 square feet ( 160 square metres ) and has three rooms , one being living quarters and the other two greenhouses of sorts to grow plants and keep the mealworms			1
technology such as fuel cells allowed the volunteers to be self - sufficient			0
the idea behind the study was to ascertain if eating worms for a prolonged amount of time was feasible in terms of both morale and nutrition for space missions			1
according to the @entity89 , the idea has been met with criticism in the @entity91 where critics say , despite the high protein content , having to eat mealworms would lower morale in astronauts owing to their unappealing look and taste			2
however , it appears the volunteers were more than happy to chow down on mealworms , suggesting they could be the meal of choice for future astronauts , known as taikonauts in @entity10			1
‘ it did take them some time to adapt to the diet , ’ @entity106 , a researcher involved in the project , told the @entity89			0
‘ none of them had ever tried them as food before			0
‘ the process was not difficult to manage			0
they all seemed healthy and happy throughout the experiment			0
’ the volunteers ate only laboratory - grown plants and insects such as mealworms ( stock image shown )			1
this was @entity10 's first manned test of the ' @entity29 ' , a 500 - cubic metre ( 17,700 cubic feet ) module that is @entity10 's first and the world 's third bioregenerative life support base captain @entity24 ( front ) and crew members @entity23 ( middle ) and @entity27 ( rear ) of the ' @entity69 ' walk out of the closed lab clutching some of the plants they grew inside			2
it is hoped this experiment will help future space missions mealworms are said to be made of over 76 per cent protein , making them highly nutritious			1
during this experiment , however , the volunteers were n’t able to get all the nutrients they needed from those insects alone – some meals had to be supplemented with more regular foods			1
they also fattened up the mealworms , which can grow to the size of a finger in a month , with plants			2
the next stage for the research will be to add a third greenhouse to the @entity69 facility , which will enable a fourth volunteer to be added on a future experiment			2
this should also mean the next set of volunteers can be entirely self - sufficient on worms and vegetables kept in the biosphere			1
and ultimately it is hoped that the research could give future @entity10 astronauts a suitable food source that is nourishing			1
‘ the @entity168 has recommended mealworms for starving people in poor areas such as @entity172 , so we thought why ca n't they be used by astronauts in space , " @entity106 continued			2
‘ worms may look disgusting at first glance , but they are actually the cleanest and healthiest food source			1
’ @entity10 's manned space programme began in 2003 and has come on leaps and bounds since then			0
here , @entity10 watch the launch of @entity10 's first manned space flight at the @entity184 in the northwestern province of @entity186 on 15 october with @entity10 's first astronaut , @entity43 , on board			0

astronauts could one day be chowing down on insects on long missions
that 's according to researchers running an experiment at the @entity39
they kept three volunteers in *isolation* for three months in a biosphere
during that time they ate just mealworms and plants
the scientists said the experiment proved worms could be a good source of food for future astronauts
