a ' quiet pint ' at the local pub turned into a 7,000 - mile trip to @entity3 for two @entity5 men – armed with just a @entity7 carrier bag containing some clothes			1
company director @entity9 , 33 , had decided to go for a beer at the @entity12 pub in @entity13 with friends for a relaxing friday night			1
but one turned to two and then three and more - and at 1am mr @entity9 , along with friend @entity16 , 33 , decided to go home			1
however , their decision soon led them halfway around the world			0
@entity9 , 33 , ( far left ) and friend @entity16 , 33 , ( second left ) pictured with friends they met in @entity3 after leaving the pub they stopped off for some more beers from the petrol station along the way			1
it was back at mr @entity9 's house where the two , in their drunken stupor , decided to book a taxi to @entity32 in the morning and fly to @entity3			1
mr @entity9 said : ' after lots of jokes , at around 11am the next day with a hangover , @entity16 asks if i had my passport handy and came up with the idea of us going to @entity3 straight away			2
the pair flew from @entity32 to @entity41 , @entity3 with a stopover in @entity43 ' quiet drink ' : mr @entity9 had decided to go for a beer at the @entity12 pub ( pictured ) in @entity13 with friends for a relaxing friday night ' i thought he was joking at first and then he pointed out how there are quite a few lads from @entity13 over there we had n't seen for a while			1
travelling light : mr @entity9 admitted he only took a @entity7 bag with a few pairs of boxers and t - shirts ' then we got into a taxi he 'd phoned and - apart from the short delay of picking up @entity16 's passport - we were off to @entity32			1
when we got in the taxi we did n't even have flights			0
' it 's a last minute bad idea - but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea			0
' mr @entity9 revealed that while battling a hangover , he managed to pack a @entity7 carrier bag with some boxer shorts and a few t - shirts			1
the journey to the airport saw mr @entity9 come close to cancelling as the alcohol started to wear off , but once they arrived at @entity32 , the pair managed to book flights to the @entity77			2
the key protagonist may have been rigger mr @entity16 , who was recognised by the taxi driver as having splashed out on these last - minute trips numerous times in the past			2
it was then that the taxi driver revealed that it was n't the first time mr @entity16 had done a similar flit - having used him several times before to make similar last - minute trips			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ the taxi driver told me how @entity16 had done this same last minute thing four times now , with him being the same driver to take him to @entity32 in each case			1
i thought that was hilarious and then said “ ok , i 'm in ”			0
’ flights from @entity32 to @entity41 were secured			0
with a stopover in @entity43 it amounted to two seven - hour trips			0
' some of the lads have serious girlfriends and kids and it 's been pretty intense for some of them , ' added mr @entity9			2
a few quiet beers in @entity13 ended up with a trip to @entity3 ( above ) for mr @entity9 and his friend ' i would n't like to be facing the grief that some of them will be inevitably going home to			2
' but no - one 's misbehaved to be fair			0
i think it 's a place where younger lads would perhaps go crazy			0
i 'm single right now - so no consequences to face for me			0
' the pair are making their way back to @entity13 today			0
mr @entity9 added : ' i 'd never fancied @entity3 before - so going last minute for a few days is perfect			2
' today we 're by the pool and out to complete our version of @entity117			0
