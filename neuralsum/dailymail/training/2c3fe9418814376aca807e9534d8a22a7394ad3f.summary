by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 20:26 est , 1 march 2013 at first glance they might be mistaken for a standard pair of cream trainers — the sort you ’d find in any sports shop on the @entity8			1
but the truth is there ’s nothing standard about this pair of shoes specially commissioned for pop star @entity14			1
made from a combination of crocodile , anaconda , stingray and ostrich skin , as well as calfskin , it ’s little wonder that everyone from animal rights groups to the singer ’s fans has branded her ‘ cruel ’ and ‘ spoilt ’ for making such a tacky and exploitative fashion statement			1
@entity14 ’s trainers are based on a wedge - style shoe by designer @entity30 , but have been given a bling makeover by @entity34 company @entity33 ( @entity35 )			1
unique : the handcrafted sneakers are custom - made for @entity14 using a mix of stingray , ostrich , calf 's fur , crocodile and anaconda skins the company , which states that their exotic skins come from a legal supplier in @entity48 , previously customised a pair of trainers for @entity14 ’s rapper husband , @entity52 , that were covered in calf , ostrich , python , boa constrictor , crocodile , lizard , alligator and stingray skins , as well as patches of imitation elephant skin			1
@entity35 boss @entity63 says : ‘ it ’s legal			1
i do n’t think animal rights campaigners like it very much , but it ’s legal			1
’ legal or not , animal lovers are outraged that @entity14 has followed in her husband ’s footsteps			1
@entity35 insists ‘ no animals were beaten , harmed or killed in the development and crafting of the sneakers ’ — though it remains slightly unclear how you make a shoe out of any kind of leather without killing animals			2
expensive taste : @entity14 often wear these £ 62,000 gold - plated @entity81 leggings on stage the pressure group @entity87 ( @entity87 ) is in no doubt : ‘ these custom - made [ trainers ] come with a high price — and it ’s paid by the various animals who were beaten and skinned alive or cruelly farmed and killed			1
’ here , the @entity90 reveals how these exotic creatures suffer — in the name of high fashion			1
@entity94 with its interlocking scales , the skin used for the detailing over the heel and toe of @entity14 ’s trainers is immediately identifiable as snake			1
@entity94 , like crocodiles , are subject to controls by the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) , but the trade is so poorly regulated that it is difficult to establish the source of the skins			2
for every animal that goes through the system legally , it is estimated that another will be smuggled			1
excessive hunting of the snakes — which are found in @entity114 and can grow to a length of 20 ft — poses a threat to the viability of the species in the long - term			2
there are also widespread concerns about the barbaric ways in which snakes captured in the wild are killed			2
as skins are valued at £ 23 a foot ( designer @entity128 sells his over-the - knee anaconda boots for £ 2,000 ) , great care is taken to ensure it is removed undamaged from the snake			1
the creature will often first be stunned with a blow to the head , rather than killed outright			2
in order to loosen the skin , a hose pipe is inserted into its jaws and the snake filled up with water , swelling the reptile up like a balloon			1
it will be left like that for ten minutes or so , a leather cord tied around its neck to prevent the liquid escaping			2
then its head is impaled on a meat hook , a couple of quick incisions follow , and the loosened skin is peeled off with a series of brutal tugs — much like a rubber glove being removed from a hand			1
from there , the skin will be sent to a tannery before being turned into luxury shoes or handbags			1
because of the snake ’s slow metabolic rate it can survive , skinned alive , for hours or even days until succumbing to the effects of dehydration or shock			0
@entity168 the ostrich skin that forms the tongue of @entity14 ’s shoe is one of the strongest commercial leathers and bears the distinctive pattern of bumps made by the quill follicles of the bird ’s feathers			1
while ostriches were originally farmed in @entity181 for their feathers and meat , their leather became popular in the @entity34 during the seventies when it was used for cowboy boots			0
since then it has become a firm fashion favourite — the hides fetch more than £ 320 each			0
@entity192 bag designer @entity190 sells ostrich leather totes for up to £ 4,500 , while the classic @entity195 50 bag in ostrich skin costs £ 7,000			1
skinned : the team behind the sneakers used ostrich skin for the tongue of the shoes and @entity94 for the heel and toes detailing to please @entity14 critics of ostrich farming point out that in the wild the birds have well - developed courtship , nest - building and chick - rearing behaviours , and live to 50 or more			1
farmed , they are penned up , their eggs taken away from them and their chicks killed at little more than a year old			0
wild ostriches can run at up to 40mph and will cover 15 to 20 miles a day in their natural habitat , but farmed ostriches are often confined to an acre or less of land			0
as a result , they are prone to painful leg deformities and suffer from other diseases , such as avian flu			0
animal rights campaigners have also highlighted the stress ostriches endure during slaughter			1
the bird ’s legs are tied together and a water - soaked hood placed over its head			0
it is then electrocuted , hoisted upside down and its throat cut as it bleeds to death			0
@entity237 farmed around the world , crocodile skin is so popular that 1.3 million of the reptiles are slaughtered to meet demand each year			1
@entity14 has a four - inch strip of crocodile skin on the back of her trainers			1
crocodiles are favoured by shoe and bag designers			0
a grey crocodile @entity250 costing £ 79,000 is one of many such bags owned by the socialite @entity252			1
the majority of crocodiles killed for their skin are bred and reared on farms			1
but every year more than 90,000 are also killed in the wild			0
fierce fang : @entity260 's sneakers have a four - inch strip of crocodile hide on the back a further 225,000 are ‘ ranched ’			1
this is where they are monitored in their natural environments and then brought on to farms for slaughter			0
animal rights campaigners say the crowded pens in which the reptiles are kept cause great stress			2
they are unable to swim away to quiet areas , as they would in the wild			0
there is no mud for them to lie in or grass to hide in			0
their natural instincts to hunt are denied and they develop abnormalities and deformities because they ca n’t walk or swim			0
after just three years , their short lives come to a brutal end — the usual method of killing will be a bullet			0
the crocodiles are grabbed by workers and their snouts bound before being dispatched with a rifle			0
a direct shot to the brain , which is encased in a 2cm - thick skull , is far from guaranteed			0
while this might seem a callous end to a short life for an animal that would live for 70 years or more in the wild , it is more humane than the method used on some farms			2
according to @entity87 , the reptile can be killed by hammering a chisel between the base of the skull and the first vertebrae , a procedure which can take between five and eight blows to achieve			0
they are then skinned , often while still alive			0
like snakes , because of their slow metabolisms they can survive , in agony , for up to two hours after they have been completely skinned			2
only certain bits of the skin will be considered good enough to use , which means it can take up to four crocodiles to make one bag			2
as a result of the intensive hunting of wild crocodiles , they are supposedly protected under the @entity103 agreement			0
raw hide : stingray skin is 25 times more durable than cow hide and is worth £ 63 per square foot @entity335 famed for being 25 times more durable than cowhide , stingray leather — often referred to as shagreen — is used on the three fastenings on @entity14 ’s trainers			1
traditionally , the rays , which are closely related to sharks , would have been killed for food , the skins a by - product used for the grips of @entity348 and @entity349 swords			0
in recent years , the leather has become a popular material in the world of high fashion — @entity355 ’s stingray purses sell for £ 800			2
because the skins are relatively small , they tend to be used for purses and wallets rather than bags			0
the skin is worth £ 63 per square foot			2
while the fish are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters , their populations are increasingly under threat			0
five species of stingray are listed as ‘ endangered ’ and there is a worrying lack of data about the population levels of many others			2
it is estimated that in @entity377 alone , two million rays are caught each year , with some boats bringing in up to 30 metric tons of stingrays per trip			0
because stingrays reach maturity relatively late and produce relatively few offspring , there is concern that over-fishing could cause populations to collapse			0
last year , in response to this threat , @entity388 banned fishing for stingrays in its territorial waters			0
scientists have warned that unless steps are taken on an international level to significantly reduce the catch of these animals , they are at risk of disappearing .			0
