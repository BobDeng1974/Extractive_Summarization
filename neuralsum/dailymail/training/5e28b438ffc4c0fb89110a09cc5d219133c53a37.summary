when you look at your sleek , shiny phone it may look clean - excepting perhaps a few scuffs and smears from normal wear and tear			2
but look below the surface and you will find an interior that is far more toxic than most people realise			0
researchers have undertaken a chemical analysis of 36 mobile handsets - including the @entity15 - to find out which ones pose the most risk to the health of humans and our environment			1
researchers from healthystuff.org and ifixit analysed the chemicals inside leading phones , giving them a chemical ranking for how environmentally friendly they are			2
the researchers analysed 30 different handsets for the research , including the bestselling @entity29 ubiquitous electronic gadgets harbour a staggering array of toxic chemicals , from hazardous flame retardants , pvc and bromine to heavy metals like lead , tin and chromium - and even mercury and cadmium			1
however the hazardous ingredients of mobile phones have long been kept under wraps by manufacturers who are tight lipped about the recipes they use for their high - tech components			1
the only way to find out then , is to take apart the gadgets and analyse their chemical components - which experts from ifixit.org and @entity54 have now done			0
@entity55 sampled 36 different mobile phones that had been released in the last 5 years			1
the phones were completely disassembled and interior and exterior components were sampled by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry - a process which determines the chemical composition of a material			2
the team found that more modern phones are far more environmentally friendly - although the latest @entity15 does have more harmful chemicals than its predecessor			1
@entity67 is a suburb of @entity69 , the capital of @entity70 and the country 's largest city			0
above it rises a doomsday column of acrid black smoke - fuelled by burning plastic e-waste			0
the area is poisonous , post-apocalyptic hell - a sprawling , toxic dumping ground stretching for a mile or two			0
this is the final resting place for your old tv , computer or mobile phone			1
piles of cracked computer monitors sit in rancid pools of noxious green slime , while the circuit boards and innards of old pcs leak toxic mercury , beryllium and cadmium , poisoning the earth			0
scampering over these mounds of decaying computers are red - eyed gangs of wild , young boys in rags who smash old computer components with rocks to rip out the valuable copper wire inside			0
here they burn the plastic away from computer monitors and plastic encased cables to get to the precious metals inside			0
the combustion releases toxic metals - lead , beryllium , cadmium , mercury - into the atmosphere			0
likewise , burning creates some of the most carcinogenic and toxic substances known , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , dioxins and furans this desperate situation here is part of a pattern all over the globe - @entity124 nations dump their electronic rubbish on developing countries , poisoning communities , polluting water sources and causing birth defects , mental retardation and , ultimately , death			1
the researchers then ranked the phones on a scale of 0 - 5 - with lowest being the best - according to three criteria : by chemical , by component and overall			1
the @entity139 ranked the least toxic phone followed by the @entity141 and the @entity142			2
the new @entity15 ranked 5th - better than its main competitor , @entity144 's @entity29 , which ranked 9th			1
the most toxic phone tested was the @entity147 , which was so poisonous it prompted a report by environmental group @entity151 warning of the environmental dangers it posed			2
every phone sampled in the study contained at least one of following hazardous chemicals : lead , bromine , chlorine , mercury and cadmium			2
these hazardous substances can pollute throughout a product ’s life cycle , including when the minerals are extracted ; when they are processed ; during phone manufacturing ; and at the end of the phone ’s useful life			0
emissions during disposal and recycling of phones as electronic waste , or ' e-waste ' , are particularly problematic			2
a 2004 study found that three - quarters of all cell phones leach lead at levels that would qualify them as hazardous waste			0
while tracking e-waste is difficult , it is estimated that 50 - 80 per cent is exported to countries such as @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and the @entity190 , where there is a labour - intensive , informal recycling infrastructure that often lacks environmental and human health safeguards			1
meanwhile , the mining of some tin , tantalum , tungsten and gold vital for use in the manufacture of mobile phones has been linked to bloody conflicts in the @entity204			1
@entity205 , research director at the @entity206 and founder of @entity54 , said : ' even the best phones from our study are still loaded with chemical hazards			0
' these chemicals , which are linked to birth defects , impaired learning and other serious health problems , have been found in soils at levels 10 to 100 times higher than background levels at e-waste recycling sites in @entity186			1
' we need better federal regulation of these chemicals , and we need to create incentives for the design of greener consumer electronics			0

researchers carry out analysis of 36 mobile phones to determine which contain the most toxic chemicals in their components
@entity15 ranked fifth cleanest in the league table - compared to ninth for *nearest* competitor the @entity29
many chemicals contained in mobile phone handsets are linked to birth defects and health problems
much of the waste is sent to the developing world for recycling , where there is *lax* regulation and environmental safeguards
