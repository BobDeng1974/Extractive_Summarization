for most women pregnancy might be tough – but it is also a time of great hope and expectation			0
for @entity7 , however , it became a recurring ordeal as she defied doctors ’ warnings that her babies could be born with @entity13 ’s syndrome			1
when the 33 - year - old account manager became pregnant with her first two children , she was told both times after routine tests that her babies may have the condition			1
but after she refused to undergo invasive further screening due to the risk of miscarriage , @entity22 , now five , and two - year - old @entity23 were born with no abnormalities			1
miss von @entity7 said the routine @entity13 ’s tests had ‘ ruined ’ her pregnancies and urged other women to think seriously before having them			1
indeed , when she became pregnant for a third time with daughter @entity29 , now eight months , she decided not to undergo screening at all			1
this is assessed along with an ultrasound scan to work out if a baby has a heightened chance of @entity13 ’s			2
during miss von @entity7 ’s first pregnancy , she and her managing director husband @entity44 , 41 , were told there was a one in 700 likelihood that @entity22 had the condition			1
with @entity23 , the chance was one in 24			2
for healthy pregnant women in their 20s , the risk of @entity13 ’s is usually lower than one in 1,000			2
miss von @entity7 claims each time doctors put her under pressure to have @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , an invasive further test			0
but due to the risk of miscarriage caused by @entity56 – during which fluid is taken from the umbilical cord for analysis – she refused			2
miss von @entity7 , who lives in @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ‘ after being given such drastic news – which turned out to be wrong – i spent my whole pregnancies obsessed my children might not be healthy			0
i could n’t just relax and enjoy the experience			0
’ recalling her pregnancy with @entity22 , she said : ‘ i was devastated when i got a phone call saying the test showed a higher risk of having a baby with @entity13 ’s syndrome			1
‘ doctors wanted me to undergo a @entity56 test , but i refused because by then i ’d discovered the risk of miscarriage – around one to two babies in 100 – was higher than my chance of having a baby with @entity13 ’s			1
’ @entity22 was born healthy in july 2009			2
but the nightmare recurred with @entity23 two years later			0
‘ medical staff were very negative when i refused [ a @entity56 ] , ’ miss von @entity7 said			0
‘ it shocked me how keen they were for me to go in so fast for an invasive test that could have caused a miscarriage , simply so i could be “ reassured ”			0
‘ i could n’t have lived with myself if that had resulted in me losing my precious daughter			0
’ by the time she became pregnant with @entity29 , she decided not to have the test			1
‘ @entity44 and i felt even if we were having a baby with @entity13 ’s we would not terminate the pregnancy , ’ she said			0
