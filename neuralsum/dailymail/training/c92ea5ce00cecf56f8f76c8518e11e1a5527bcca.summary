by @entity0 last updated at 12:56 pm on 21st february 2012 kick off your shoes and get out the surfboards ... because @entity4 could be hotter than @entity5 on thursday with temperatures as high as @entity7 ( @entity8 )			1
this would match the record for the month , set on february 13 , 1988 , in @entity11 , according to the @entity12			1
as the @entity4 basks in two days of unseasonable warmth after a six - week cold snap , @entity13 is expected to hit a mere @entity16 ( @entity17 )			1
@entity11 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are the regions most likely to benefit from the milder conditions			1
@entity23 in @entity11 was a winter wonderland last week			1
but by thursday , temperatures could beat the record - breaking february high of @entity7 ( @entity8 ) @entity11 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 could be warmer than @entity13 later this week meteorologist @entity27 , from @entity28 , said : ' it will be exceptionally warm for us - it 's a mile from what we 've been having of late			1
' mr @entity27 said there is a one in seven chance the february record will be broken			2
wednesday : dry and cloudy for a time in south - east @entity37 , but outbreaks of rain already in the north and west will spread south - eastwards through the day			1
the rain will be heavy in places , but particularly in western @entity44 , @entity45 and over high ground in @entity37 and @entity47			2
a blustery day with strong gusts in places			2
@entity51 temp : @entity52 ( @entity53 ) thursday : very mild in places and remaining windy			2
it will be mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain in northern @entity37 , @entity44 and @entity45			0
however , it will become increasingly dry across much of @entity47 and southern parts of @entity37 , with a few sunny spells developing , particularly further east			0
@entity62 ( @entity8 ) friday : some rain in northwest , slowly sinking south through friday , with temperatures returning nearer to normal			0
and if @entity4 does break the @entity7 barrier , it will be the second time in five months that such a record has been smashed			1
last october , @entity70 in @entity71 reached @entity72			0
according to the @entity12 , temperatures towards the end of the week are more likely to reach @entity75 ( @entity76 )			1
this is still almost treble the average for this time of year , which is around @entity80 ( @entity81 )			1
it would also bring the @entity4 weather to levels currently seen in @entity85 and @entity86			1
however , by the weekend , forecasters predict rain and lower temperatures will return			0
@entity90 , chief forecaster at the @entity12 , said : ' there will be much milder conditions			0
' temperatures are expected to get into double figures in many areas as we see a return to unsettled conditions with strong winds and heavy rain in places			2
' @entity28 , established in 1987 , is a group of leading consultant meteorologists , including former @entity105 weatherman @entity103			0
@entity12 needs supercomputers , say mps the @entity12 would be able to issue more confident severe weather warnings and increase its accuracy on long - term forecasts if it had more powerful supercomputers , a group of @entity107 has said			2
a report from the @entity114 concluded the national forecaster was being ' held back by insufficient supercomputing capacity ' but acknowledged that affordability was an issue			0
the politicians agreed with the findings of a 2010 review which said a ' step - change ' in favour of the new technology was necessary to improve the accuracy of short and long - range forecasts and climate predictions			0
@entity12 officials said they would have been able to predict more accurate forecasts in relation to the snowstorms in the @entity132 in february 2009 and the @entity134 floods ( above ) in november 2009 if the organisation had a greater supercomputer capacity the report said : ' it is of great concern to us that scientific advances in weather forecasting and the associated public benefits ( particularly in regard to severe weather warnings ) are ready and waiting but are being held back by insufficient supercomputing capacity			2
' we echo the recent conclusions of the government chief scientific adviser and others , that a step - change in supercomputing capacity is required			0
we acknowledge , however , that affordability is an issue			0
' the @entity12 believes there would be ' a very rapid ' 10 - 1 return on investment in the computers , which are built to make billions of mathematical calculations as quickly as possible			0
officials at the organisation said it would have been able to predict more accurate forecasts in relation to the snowstorms in the @entity132 in february 2009 and the @entity134 floods in november 2009 if it had a greater supercomputer capacity			0
the report recommended the @entity12 , which provides weather data to the government and the @entity166 , develops a ten - year strategy for supercomputing resources .			1

@entity13 expected to reach @entity16 ( @entity17 )
warmer weather *due* to hit @entity11 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 ... for two days only
@entity4 average for this time of year is @entity80 ( @entity81 )
