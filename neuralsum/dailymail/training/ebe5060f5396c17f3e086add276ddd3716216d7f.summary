mr @entity25 suggested the fare was not reported to @entity21 's controller because he had identified a vulnerable woman who could be sexually exploited			1
the court heard she was ' noticeably affected ' after drinking lager and whisky in a pub with friends			1
she was ' talking gibberish ' and left her jacket , handbag and phone behind			2
mr @entity25 said @entity21 ' delivered ' her to @entity0 and @entity1 , getting her to commit a sex act on him on the way			1
the jury heard she was dropped off near their home and raped in turn on a bench in @entity51 , @entity4 , while she was unconscious			1

she is said to have come round while @entity1 was having sex with her			1
@entity0 is alleged to have told her he had already had sex with her			2
mr @entity25 said dna evidence supported the woman 's evidence that sexual activity took place with both men			1
he has also alleged that @entity22 then turned up ' too late physically to join in the rape that he had set up '			2
' the prosecution case is that there was a conspiracy to rape ( the woman ) while she was in no fit state either to consent or resist , ' mr @entity25 said			1
he continued : ' @entity0 and @entity1 conspired to rape her because they both agreed to do so ; to take delivery of her and rape her together in each other 's presence			1
' @entity21 , the prosecution say , is part of the same agreement because he delivered the girl to @entity0 and @entity1 for them to rape her			1
' @entity21 knew that she was in no fit state to consent or resist because he had been able to abduct her to @entity51 , rather than take her home			0
' @entity90 is also part of the same agreement because he trafficked her from @entity92 to @entity0 and arranged where and to whom she was to be delivered ; he tried to organise a hotel room and attended at the park to join in but was too late because she had regained consciousness by then			0
' @entity0 , pictured , is accused of telling the woman that she had already had sex with him when she came around on a @entity4 park bench while she was allegedly being raped by @entity1 , who also denies the claim the schoolteacher said she was ' absolutely mortified ' to realise she had been raped by two men on a park bench after falling unconscious on a night out			1
the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , said it was ' like a massive bad dream ' after claiming she had been ' abducted ' and taken by a taxi driver to a park bench in @entity4 , @entity23 , where she was raped by him and his friends			1
giving evidence at @entity18 earlier today , the woman said : ' i was absolutely mortified but i just could not deal with it			1

' i 'm a decent person and i would never want to do this to anyone			0
i like to be in control			0
' the jury heard that the educated woman , who teaches secondary school students , had gone on a birthday celebration to @entity29 , @entity23 , over the may bank holiday earlier this year , with a group of friends			1
after becoming heavily intoxicated , she had become separated from friends and made her way to @entity133 , where she bought herself some fast food			2
it was from there that the jury was shown cctv of her getting into the first of three taxis she hired to get her home , but she claims she does n't remember anything until she woke up on a park bench in @entity4			0
under cross examination at @entity18 , pictured , the woman denied that it was ' sex between consenting adults ' claiming that the incident on may 25 - 26 was ' life - destroying ' giving evidence from behind a screen , the woman said : ' i just ca n't believe it			1
i was on my own and i think i must have just blacked out			0
' i like to drink and i like to socialise but in terms of sleeping with men on a park bench , that 's totally out of character for me			2
' i got back home , went to the top of the stairs and went to bed			0
' the following morning , the woman said she woke early and phoned her partner of four years to inform her of the events from the night before			2
she said : ' i said to her ' i had sex last night with four @entity170 men '			1
i was really , really drunk and needed to get back			0
' my elbows were swollen , my chest hurt and my knees were grazed			0
i felt sick and i was gagging			0
' i was n't going to tell my parents			0
i was still slightly drunk when i woke up			0
' the jury heard that after leaving @entity29 , the woman took a taxi to @entity178 , @entity23 , but asked to be dropped off in nearby @entity179			1
she then got into another taxi and ended up being taken to @entity51 in @entity4 , where she alleges the sexual assault took place			0
' i felt scared when i was on the park bench , ' she said			0
' there were these two guys talking in a different language and i thought what is going on ? ' i do n't know how i got from the pub into the taxi			0
' i remember having a conversation with the taxi driver about my bag and my phone as i had lost them			0
' it would be out of character for me to bring the conversation round to the subject of sex			2
' it 's 1000 per cent not in my character to do something like this			0
' the court heard the woman made three cash withdrawals on the night , totalling more than £ 80 , as well as spending over £ 60 on drinks in a @entity29 city centre bar			2
the woman said : ' i do n't recall buying anyone a spirit but i recall buying those £ 1 shots that you buy in those plastic glasses			2
' i ca n't remember withdrawing the cash			0
the only thing i remember is thinking i needed to pay the third taxi driver			0
' mr @entity218 , defending @entity0 , said : ' i 'm going to suggest to you that what happened in @entity51 in the early hours of 26 may , bank holiday monday , was not rape in any sense of the word			1
' it was sex between consenting adults , all of whom were active , voluntary and an enthusiastic part of what went on			2
' i suggest that it was you that in fact instigated the sex and you positively encouraged it			2
there 's no secret or mystery to it			0
' are you crying rape because you regret what happened ? is that what all this was about ? ' the woman added : ' this is the most humiliating experience of my life			1
i knew what this would entail			0
' if i wanted it to happen , i would never have mentioned it			0
' it was life - destroying			2
