by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 12 june 2013 d'oh ! shows like @entity2 have turned fathers and fatherhood into a laughing stock @entity6 is approaching			1
a time to celebrate the huge contribution made to family life by the nation 's dads			1
a special moment of the year to say thanks for all the sacrifices made , for the hard work , for the long hours of parenthood freely given but rarely acknowledged			0
an opportunity to salute the simple , quiet nobility of being a father			0
or to put it another way			0
to run the dad - flag up the dad - pole in the kingdom of dad - dom. somebody 's got to do it ! for somehow , in both big and small ways , in unwitting behaviours that corrode society , fathers and fatherhood have become a laughing stock			1
in a new study , parents have criticised what is being labelled as @entity34 ; the endless casual contempt shown to fathers depicted on television programmes and in advertising , particularly in the messages and entertainment aimed at children			1
a @entity43 survey released this week revealed growing dissatisfaction and alarm at the way fathers are routinely portrayed as bungling fools and worse			1
the report singled out @entity51 's unshaven , overweight and hopeless father , @entity50 ; bad role model @entity50 of the @entity53 community ; and of course perennial loser @entity54 as particularly damaging to children 's perception of fatherhood			1
one can see their point			0
@entity50 is called fat by his daughter			1
he can not read without his glasses and can not map read at all			0
idiot ! on a trip to the supermarket , he defies perfect , health - conscious @entity68 by sneaking a chocolate cake into the trolley			1
@entity71 , oink ! when @entity50 takes them to his office , the kids are not impressed by his job			1
there are even moments when @entity51 seems to favour her little brother @entity77 over her daddy			0
meanwhile , @entity80 ' @entity50 deludes himself that it is he , not wife @entity83 , who is king of the family cave			1
he loses his temper easily , loves lounging around the cave in his underpants and has a gambling problem			0
where do we start ? @entity54 has many failings , but is generally depicted as a dad who has the brainpower of a gnat			1
he also eats too many doughnuts , drinks too many beers and is generally a bad influence on his kids			2
yes , of course it is only meant as fun , with scriptwriters wringing out every last laugh from a juicy comic stereotype - but millions and millions of children watch and absorb these calamity dad - escapades without having the sophistication or the ability to contextualise these imaginary adventures			1
and not everyone can see the joke			0
@entity114 : archetypal bad father @entity50 with best mate @entity116 , and @entity118 ( right ) , who is fat , can not read and is , in short , an idiot an overwhelming 93 per cent of mums and dads who took part in the @entity43 poll said that the way fathers appear on television , as well as in books and on adverts , bears no relation to their real - life contribution to family life			1
more than half agreed society was becoming ' more appreciative of how important a dad 's role is ' and that fathers are ' much closer to their kids than in the past '			1
nine in ten dads said they felt they were working harder than their own fathers to be a good parent			1
two - thirds said they were proud to work harder to support their family and a similar proportion are ' happier and more settled ' than before they had children			1
despite all their efforts , however , dads have to sit back and watch themselves being endlessly lampooned on television as not much more than lazy sperm donors			2
half of them complained that too many families on television were either shown with feckless fathers - or with no father figures in sight at all			1
the insidious message that men are witless and pointless , mere playthings to be stamped on by the entire family is broadcast over and over again			0
this seems not only unfair , but quite extraordinary			0
at a time when there is a real need for strong , male role models , fathers are undermined to such an extent that they are often regarded as amusing appendages of no real use to the family			2
perhaps even as a luxury - or a hindrance - that mum can do without			2
is this just a harmless jest ? or a form of discrimination and on - screen bullying that mothers would not accept - not for one minute ! - if it was routinely applied to them			2
to be fair , at least @entity50 , @entity50 and @entity54 have some virtues			1
despite their faults , they are all loving fathers and faithful husbands			2
they all have jobs , too			0
and whether at the architect 's office , the @entity185 or the @entity186 , they are family providers who - literally in one case - bring home the bacon			1
they might be a few rashers short every week , but they are trying their best			0
yet their ineptitude is unrelenting			0
at home it is always the mother figure - long - suffering @entity68 , @entity83 or @entity201 - who gallop to the rescue to fix everything he messes up			2
the more this image takes hold , the more the role of the father in the family unit is marginalised and the more hurtful this will be to society			0
for academic studies repeatedly show that children with involved fathers do far better at school , have a much lower chance of getting involved in crime and have better mental health			1
so should n't we be celebrating and encouraging what dads do , instead of mocking them as useless twits who ca n't change a nappy , mop a floor or unload the dishwasher without causing a tsunami of chaos ? useless dads are not confined to the simple storylines of children 's television , either			1
father figures : a record 227,000 men were classed as stay - at - home fathers last year according to the @entity235 @entity237 adverts must shoulder their share of the blame			1
we 're all familiar with the annual @entity242 advertising campaigns - the ones from boots in particular - that depict mothers as the only members of the family who are competent and organised enough to arrange the festivities , right down to the @entity249 and the stuffing			2
few adverts show fathers in charge of the home front , keeping calm and carrying on			2
sometimes it gets too much			0
last year , a group of fathers in @entity258 forced @entity259 to withdraw a campaign for their disposable nappies			2
the dads were outraged at being depicted as ' clueless ' or too busy watching football to check their babies			2
it was the dads , not the nappies , who were being put on trial			2
there is no escape from the bad dad			0
television sit - coms on both sides of the @entity275 are stuffed with men behaving badly			0
good parenting : nine in ten dads who responded to the survey said they felt they were working harder than their own fathers to be a good parent in @entity285 , one of the longest running series on the @entity288 , grumpy , hapless @entity284 ( @entity283 ) was bossed about by his wife ( @entity289 ) , regularly fleeced for money by his kids and always outfoxed in his perennial bid to relax on the sofa at home			1
outnumbered shows dad @entity295 outsmarted by his three kids , while shameless father - of - six @entity297 is an ex-convict unemployed alcoholic prone to drunken rants			0
@entity300 's @entity299 is always leading his family straight towards the jaws of calamity ( ' what 's the plan , @entity306 ? ' ) while shows such as @entity308 and @entity309 also feature dads of spectacular incompetence			1
meanwhile , who is the doofus under the roofus of @entity315 ? need you ask			0
adrift amongst a family of strong , powerful and scheming woman , it is daffy @entity320 ( @entity321 ) who is hapless enough to have lost the family fortune , snogged the maid in a cupboard and is unable to put a jacket on or brush the dandruff off his shoulders without help			0
all is not fair with dads on the family front			0
the point is , many of the jokes aimed at fathers would be banned if they were aimed at women , ethnic minorities or religious groups			0
it seems hardly just ; particularly as so many dads are devoted , hardworking and would do anything for their families			0
back in the @entity343 , fathers were always the authority figure , the head of the tribe			0
in comparison , today 's dads are demonised and sidelined just too much - yes , even you , @entity54			1
and particularly on @entity6 , their day of days , can they expect to be properly honoured instead of being treated as an under - appreciated resource in the family , rather like a hat stand in the hallway during summer ? yes they can			0
because industry statistics show that it is mothers who usually purchase gifts and cards on behalf of the children			0

@entity43 survey reveals growing alarm at tv depiction of fathers
characters like @entity50 and @entity54 give dads a bad name
but good dads exist - and are essential to their children 's development
