by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 16:23 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 6 september 2013 @entity1 's highest court ruled today that a state judge does not have the authority to amend a controversial 30 - day sentence he handed down to a former teacher convicted of raping a 14 - year - old girl			1
district judge @entity9 last week sentenced @entity11 high school teacher @entity10 to 30 days in jail for the 2007 rape of @entity14 in his home			1
he said the girl , who committed suicide before the case went to trial , seemed older than her 14 years and was ' probably as much in control of the situation ' as her teacher			2
blocked : @entity22 voted 4 - 2 barring judge @entity9 ( pictured ) from holding a hearing to possibly amend rapist 's 30 - day sentence the lenient jail term and the judge 's provocative argumentation sparked widespread outrage among women 's groups and victims ’ advocates			1
amid public outcry and growing pressure from the persecution , who vowed to appeal the sentence , judge @entity9 apologized for his earlier remarks and called a hearing to re-examine and possibly amend @entity10 's sentence - a move the state attorney general challenged as being outside @entity9 's legal authority			1
on friday , @entity22 agreed , ruling 4 - 2 against @entity9 's planned unilateral action , and paving the way for prosecutors to file an appeal			1
‘ we conclude that the stated intent of the @entity51 ( @entity9 ) to alter the initially imposed oral sentence in today 's scheduled hearing is unlawful and that the proceeding should be arrested , ’ the court ruled , without commenting on the validity of the sentence itself			2
the decision came down just hours before the state judge was to convene the hearing to reconsider the sentence			0
in a bizarre twist , the defense joined the prosecution in opposing the scheduled hearing , saying that it would be ' without legal authority			0
' the prosecution said the 54 - year - old disgraced educator probably should have received a minimum of two years in prison instead of the 15 - year - term with all but a month suspended that @entity9 had given him			2
earlier this week , judge @entity9 caused further outrage by claiming that his paltry sentence ‘ actually upped ’ the convicted rapist ’s ‘ debt to society ’			1
in a written addendum to his sentence handed down in @entity83 monday the judge stated : ‘ had the defendant pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury three years ago , he would have had a basis from which to argue for a minimum sentence			2
’ victim @entity14 committed suicide on february 6 , 2010			0
she shot herself in her mother ’s bed just three weeks before her 17th birthday			2
horror : @entity14 , pictured , shot herself dead in her mother 's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail teacher : @entity10 , 54 , lost his house , his job , his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges			1
his lawyer suggested , and the judge seemed to agree on monday , that he had been ' punished enough ' according to her mother , @entity104 , the pending trial of teacher @entity10 - 49 when the rapes were committed - and trauma of the abuse were ‘ major factors ’ in her daughter ’s death			1
speaking to @entity112 mrs @entity104 said that her daughter had been ‘ in hell , ’ shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the abuse			0
her death complicated the prosecution of former @entity121 teacher @entity10 , now 54 , who was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008			1
prosecutors who had sought to put @entity127 behind bars instead settled for a three - year deferred prosecution			0
according to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this term if @entity10 pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and entered a three - stage sex offender treatment program			0
but in december 2012 the case was revived when it transpired that @entity10 had violated the terms of the program , having contact with minors and engaging in a sexual relationship [ not with a minor ] without informing his counselor			0
in his written explanation @entity147 maintained that these violations were ‘ not significant ’			0
he stated : ‘ there were violations of the treatment program , but involved no violence , no inappropriate sexual conduct , and no new criminal activity			0
‘ @entity157 ’s old treatment provider recommended that the defendant still be assessed as a low risk offender and treatable in the community			0
critic : @entity104 , @entity14 's mother criticized the judge 's apology as ' meaningless ' ‘ knowing that the @entity157 had enrolled in another sexual offender treatment program , the @entity22 is faced with deciding if the defendant should go to prison for relatively minor infractions			1
’ judge @entity9 went on to state that there was other information that could not be publicly released but had played a part in the court ’s decision : a july 2013 pre-sentence report from the @entity175 , an august 2009 psychological / psychosocial evaluation of @entity177 , and two interviews with the victim in 2009			1
judge @entity9 was forced to apologize for his comments in court , in which he claimed that the victim was ‘ older than her chronological years ’ and ‘ in control of the situation ’ in which she was raped in @entity10 ’s car , his then marital home and on school premises			1
similarly he drew fierce criticism when appearing to diminish the crime as , in defending his sentence , he said : ‘ i think people have in mind that this was some violent , forcible , horrible rape ... but it was n’t this forcible , beat up rape			0
’ in his addendum he conceded : ‘ rape under any circumstances is a horrible violent offense			0
some involved physical beatings , broken bones			0
others , as here , involve young victims legally not capable of consenting			0
all are traumatic and all are crimes			0
’ though he stated that he believed a prison sentence to be ‘ appropriate ’ in this case @entity147 stood by his decision to suspend all but 31 days of @entity177 ’s 15 years plus one day ’s credit for time served			2
he said : ‘ based on all circumstances , the @entity22 upped mr @entity218 ’s debt to society from the almost expired three years @entity220 to the 15 years suspended sentence			2
’ @entity10 ’s sentence puts him on probation for 15 years and requires him to finish sex - offender treatment and to register as a convicted sex offender			1
@entity228 prosecutor @entity227 is still reviewing the sentence with a view to finding some legal grounds for appeal , and judge @entity9 ’s explanation and defense of his decision will do little to silence the voices of those clamoring for his resignation			1
' bad form ' : judge @entity9 is running for re-election next year			1
protestors vowed to ensure he does n't receive a fifth term tens of thousands have signed an online petition calling for him to be removed from his post and yesterday hundreds protested his sentence outside @entity247			1
speaking to @entity249 ’s mother said : ‘ @entity10 took away everything beautiful in my life and he just gets to walk away			2
‘ with this sentence the judge just lets everyone off – he lets the school off and he lets him off			0

@entity22 voted 4 - 2 blocking judge @entity9 from amending @entity10 's sentence
