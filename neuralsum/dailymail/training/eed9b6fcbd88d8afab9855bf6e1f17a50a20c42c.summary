by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 11 march 2013 a 460 - foot long asteroid sped close by the @entity2 on saturday night			1
discovered just six days ago , asteroid 2013 @entity3 passed 600,000 miles from @entity2 at 8 30pm @entity4 it was about 2.5 times as far away as the moon , which in space terms is a close shave			1
' the scary part of this one is that it 's something we did n't even know about , ' said @entity12 , president of the @entity13 , commenting on live images of the asteroid flying past taken from a telescope in the @entity17			1
two other small asteroids , both about the size of the @entity34 meteor , will also be in @entity2 's neighborhood this weekend			1
asteroid 2013 @entity37 20 passed just 93,000 miles away on saturday , which @entity30 explained is ' a stone 's throw ' from @entity2			1
on sunday , asteroid 2013 @entity41 will fly about 279,000 miles from @entity2			1
both were discovered just three days ago			0
' we know that the solar system is a busy place , ' said @entity30			0
' we 're not sitting here on our pale , blue dot on our own in nice safety			0
' ' this should be a wake up call to governments			0
' asteroid sightings : scientists say we are seeing many more these days as astronomers watch the skies from all over the world , like this footage from the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , of monday 's asteroid these three are part of a series of space debris to pass near the earth recently			2
@entity68 , which passed on saturday night , was nearly eight times larger than the bus - sized asteroid that exploded on february 15 over @entity71 , @entity34			2
the force of the explosion , equivalent to about 440 kilotons of dynamite , created a shock wave that shattered windows and damaged buildings , injuring more than 1,500 people			0
1,200 were injured when an untracked lump of space rock exploded over the @entity81 in @entity34 on february 15 2013 the rock hit the atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000mph the 10,000 - ton lump of space rock exploded , creating a ‘ sonic boom ’ that shattered windows and rocked buildings on the same day another smaller asteroid called @entity91 passed closer to the @entity2 than communications and weather satellites the last time something major struck the @entity2 was in 1908 , when an asteroid about 50 metres wide exploded over @entity96 about 100 tons of material from space hit @entity2 every day			1
a bright comet show is also now on the way - @entity101 may come close to outshining the moon in november later that day , another small asteroid , known as @entity91 , passed about 17,200 miles ( 27,680 km ) from @entity2 , closer than the orbiting networks of communications and weather satellites			1
@entity106 has been ordered by the @entity107 to find and track all near - @entity2 objects 0.62 miles or larger in diameter , and estimates about 95 percent have been identified			2
however , only about 10 percent of smaller asteroids have been discovered , @entity106 scientists have said			0
the effort is intended to give scientists and engineers as much time as possible to discover if an asteroid or comet is on a collision course with @entity2 , in hopes of sending up a spacecraft to avert catastrophe			2
astronomers currently expect an object about the size of what hit @entity34 to strike the planet about every 100 years			0
near miss : the meteor is seen above a residential apartment block in the @entity81 city of @entity71 in a video shot last month			0

three asteroids passed close by this weekend
one asteroid on saturday was ' just a stone 's throw ' away from @entity2
it could have wiped out a large city if it had landed on a populated area
astronomers on the @entity17 captured a video of one flying past
