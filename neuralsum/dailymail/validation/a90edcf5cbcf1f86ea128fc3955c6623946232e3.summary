rugby union has a well - worn reputation for being the game of the elite and now we have the indisputable proof , that you indeed need to spend flash dollars to watch the rah - rahs best in action			1
in a @entity15 investigation into the cost of taking a family to the football , the @entity12 ' @entity11 games at @entity13 came in a long last , costing about $ 90 more than the best value - the @entity20 at @entity21			1
with family budgets on a tighter rein than ever before , the challenge is where to best spend your sporting dollar			0
and judging by the secrets kept by some stadia and their teams , you get the distinct impression they do n't really want you to know			0
so we decided to put them to the test and try and settle the argument , once and for all , by piecing together a direct comparison of a day ( or night ) out , for a family of four , to the home ground of the top two supported teams in each code			1
@entity43 champions @entity20 have played before packed houses at @entity21 for the past two years but while they are testing their fans ' resolve this season in the @entity48 they can still boast that they are looking after their loyal followers when it comes to pricing the @entity52 , with almost 32,000 members to their name , kick off their title defence in the @entity56 on thursday against rugby league 's other best supported club , the @entity57 but both fall just short in the pricing against @entity61 's best supported club @entity60 the @entity60 playing at both the @entity62 and @entity63 provide good value for a family of fans , particularly after the home of @entity61 announced it would cut the cost of food and beverages			1
@entity60 can boast the biggest following of any @entity73 football club with almost 70,000 members the @entity12 have one of the largest membership bases with 28,000 now signed up			1
while @entity13 is considered among the best to watch football in @entity78 following the @entity11 does not come cheap , ranking last in the @entity15 's assessment in value for money @entity82 launches into action tonight with the premiers @entity52 tackling the @entity57 at @entity13 , considered by many the premier sporting venue in @entity86			1
but does it stack up against @entity89 's home of @entity61 , the @entity62 ? or what about the tight - knit groups at @entity21 which back @entity93 winners , @entity20 or @entity95 's @entity48 toppers , @entity96			1
it was on the following criteria ; a family ticket in general admission ( 2 adults and 2 children ) , with the purchase of two meat pies , two hot dogs and two buckets of chips plus one beer , one soft drink and two bottles of water , as well as two supporter caps			1
clubs , governing bodies , trusts and stadiums were invited to provide the relevant information			2
and the winner is : @entity20 at @entity21 in @entity119			2
the @entity93 title - holders provide their 17,000 ( capped ) devoted followers with great value at $ 147.80			0
such was the push for membership that officials had to restrict the number in line with the capacity at @entity129 and the club placed more than a thousand hopefuls on a waiting list			0
@entity20 at @entity119 $ 147.80 2			2
@entity60 at @entity62 $ 155.10 3			1
@entity52 at @entity133 $ 163.50 4			0
@entity134 at @entity135 $ 178.78 5			2
@entity57 at @entity13 $ 202.80 6			0
@entity12 at @entity13 $ 236.04 * based on prices from clubs , stadiums and governing bodies sometimes it 's the little things , as @entity129 catering officials were quick to point out , that their meat pies and chips all come with sauce included in the price			1
the @entity62 was fast out of the blocks , this week , ahead of the @entity61 bounce , touting a drop in prices for a pie at the footy , a move which was widely acclaimed by supporters			1
a game at ' the @entity156 ' , watching @entity60 do battle against @entity158 on @entity159 , for instance , will set you back just $ 155.10 for a family outing			1
@entity52 at @entity133 and the @entity134 at @entity135 come in 3rd and 4th			2
@entity13 is arguably the best venue in @entity78 to watch the footy but unfortunately what is beyond reasonable doubt , is that you pay for the privilege , as can be seen by the price of a @entity57 game $ 202.80			1
the @entity12 confirm it by taking out the value wooden spoon , by far the most expensive at $ 236.04			1
there 's no argument that the matter of pricing in the competitive @entity73 market has become an increasingly thorny issue			0
while some happily revealed the costs , others were not so forthcoming			0
of those who were requested the information , the @entity52 and @entity12 were fastest to act , providing all the details requested within in a relatively short period of time			2
so too , the wanderers and @entity57			0
but others were not so forthcoming , preferring to completely sidestep the issue , including the @entity187			0
the @entity11 champions simply referred @entity15 to their website and @entity190 for details of pricing			1
their home ground of @entity194 , run by the @entity195 , refused to reveal what they charge for a meat pie and beer			1
perhaps worse , the @entity134 did not reply to repeated requests for the figures , even over a 48 - hour period			0
however , in stark contrast , @entity135 officials , provided a quick and detailed summary and also highlighted the added extras of an event at the revamped home of @entity73 sport , including the ability for supporters to take their own ' packed lunch and thermos '			1
more reason to cheer their team			0
@entity20 fans get the best deal when it comes to supporting a football club in @entity78			2
they topped the ranks in @entity15 's value for money investigation the heat is on			0
while @entity223 and the @entity12 offered up all details , @entity194 , which is home to @entity11 champions the @entity187 , chose not to reveal any details of how much it costs for food and drink at a big game a @entity20 home game at @entity129 ranks among the most enjoyable for football fans in @entity78 , its atmosphere rivalled now by its value for money for loyal supporters and @entity135 is also one of few where boutique beers are available to punters in the general admission areas			1
on the same day the @entity56 season was to kick off and with @entity133 playing host to both last year 's grand finalists - the @entity52 and @entity244 , officials there said there was no information on pricing which could be provided , only a week out from hosting their first league game of 2015			2
@entity96 was also unable to provide a breakdown			0
the pressure has been turned up on all codes as a result of the new deal struck by the @entity256 with its catering contractor			0
they 've reduced the price of a range of products on sale at the stadium in a bid to make going to the football and cricket more family - friendly			2
in all , eight items have been reduced with bottled water undergoing the biggest price drop from $ 5 to $ 3 - that 's a discount of about 40 per cent			0
@entity223 also plays host to the @entity57 in the @entity56			0
the cost of a family going to watch @entity86 's most successful rugby league club is about $ 202 @entity256 chief executive @entity275 estimated the price restructure will cost the @entity256 about $ 14 million in lost revenue over the course of the seven - year contract			2
' we 've listened to the fans , ' @entity275 said			0
' we understand their affordability concerns and we are very confident that this initiative will be extremely well received			0
' @entity61 chief executive @entity285 called on venues around the country to follow the @entity62 's lead			1
' they 've made a big statement , ' @entity285 said			0
' they 're leading the agenda now on this issue			0
hopefully it 's a great outcome for all of our fans across @entity78 because i think they 've put a position out there that people are going to have to respond to			0
' @entity302 is still negotiating with the @entity61 on prices but venue management hopes to make an announcement on food pricing before the start of the season			1
the @entity134 huddle before a match at the @entity135 - where entry conditions are quite relaxed including being able to bring a thermos and packed lunch to the big game			1

@entity20 are @entity43 champions and also best on ground when it comes to fans ' value for money
@entity11 is the most expensive with a day out to watch @entity12 at @entity223 getting the wooden spoon for costs
a decision by the @entity62 to cut the price of food and drinks means a @entity60 game at the home of @entity61 is good value for a family
the price pressures are telling with some clubs and stadiums refusing to reveal the costs of catering
the most relaxed venue is @entity135 where they let you take in a packed lunch and even a thermos
most of the major venues stock only *mid-strength* standard beers for those in general admission
