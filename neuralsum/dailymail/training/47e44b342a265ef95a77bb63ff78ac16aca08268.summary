brave @entity1 soldiers battling @entity3 militants in northern @entity4 have converted tractors and lorries into tanks by adding metal plates to create @entity10 - style road warriors			1
the peshmerga troops were forced to take the initiative and create their own armoured vehicles after the far better equipped @entity15 jihadists repeatedly got the better of the @entity18 ' @entity17 - era military fleet			1
in recent weeks hundreds of thousands of @entity18 have been forced to flee across the border into @entity20 , as @entity15 launched an onslaught into the autonomous @entity1 territory in northern @entity4			1
despite the odds being against them , peshmerga forces have bravely fought back against the estimated 31,000 @entity15 militants operating in @entity4 and @entity26 - whose self - declared ' caliphate ' forms an area larger than @entity29 with a population of four million brutally oppressed citizens			1
previously troops from the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) in northern @entity4 had little more than rifles and flak jackets - making them incredibly vulnerable in the face of heavily - armed @entity15 terrorists			1
much of the weaponry and military equipment currently in the hands of the jihadists was gathered after thousands of members of the @entity75 trained and expensively equipped @entity26 army melted away in the face of a lightning advance by just a few hundred @entity15 militants in june			1
as the soldiers fled the scene , they left behind millions of pounds worth of top - of - the - range and barely used equipment - all of which was quickly swept up by @entity15			2
since then the @entity1 peshmerga forces have carried out the defence of much of northern @entity4 and @entity26 , despite the fact many of the militants only know how to operate clunky , decades - old @entity17 - era weapons and are hugely under - resourced in terms of ammunition and protective equipment			1

the aircraft may have mistaken the mills and grain storage areas in the northern @entity4 town of @entity142 for an @entity3 base , said the @entity29 - based @entity144			2
there was no immediate comment from @entity147			0
the @entity75 has targeted @entity3 and other fighters in @entity4 since last week with the help of @entity151 allies , and in @entity26 since last month			2
it aims to damage and destroy the bases , forces and supply lines of the @entity157 offshoot which has captured large areas of both countries			0
the strikes in @entity142 appeared to have killed only civilians , not fighters , said @entity163 , who runs the observatory which gathers information from sources in @entity4			0
the @entity1 forces have used their homemade armoured vehicles - which are bright and elaborately decorated - to keep @entity15 advances in check , and in some cases even force them to retreat			1
one place in which the vehicles have been deployed is @entity114 - the small @entity4 town that has been besieged by @entity15 militants for a week			1
the @entity1 fighters in @entity26 said that although they had been promised equipment from the @entity75 and @entity179 countries , but so far most of the shipments included food - something they need far less urgently than weapons			2
last week , one @entity114 resident told the @entity184 : ' do n't send us food , we do n't need food ... we will eat mud if we have to			0
send us weapons , send us peshmerga			0
' but while they continue waiting for the @entity192 weapons to materialise , the @entity1 forces are reliant more than ever on their makeshift armoured vehicles to protect their population from the murderous fanatics who pose such a threat to their existence			1

hard to destroy : @entity1 troops were forced to take the initiative and create their own armoured vehicles			1
they hope to stop the advance of @entity15 militants , who are armed with high - tech weapons captured from the @entity26 army defence : while they wait for @entity192 weapons to materialise , the peshmerga forces are more reliant than ever on their makeshift armoured vehicles to protect the @entity1 population from murderous @entity15 fanatics bulk : the @entity1 fighters in @entity26 said they had been promised equipment from the @entity75 and @entity179 countries power : brave @entity1 soldiers battling @entity3 militants in northern @entity4 have converted tractors and lorries into tanks by adding metal plates to create @entity10 - style road warriors fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of @entity227 where @entity15 militants are attempting to seize control of the @entity26 capital - despite ongoing @entity192 airstrikes against the terror group			1
the fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city , with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants , who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday			0
isis have held a number of towns and villages close to the @entity26 capital since earlier in the year , when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so - called caliphate			1
jihadists : fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of @entity227 where @entity15 militants are attempting to seize control of the @entity26 capital , despite ongoing @entity192 airstrikes against the terror group ( pictured ) approaching : reports that @entity15 militants are now just one mile from @entity227 came from the @entity254 - an organisation supporting the work of @entity256 reports that @entity15 militants are now just one mile from @entity227 came from the @entity254 - an organisation supporting the work of @entity256 , vicar of the city 's @entity257 , the only @entity260 church in @entity26			1
in a message posted on @entity263 , the group said : ' the @entity3 are now less than 2km away from entering @entity227			0
they said it could never happen and now it almost has			0
' @entity266 says he overestimated what the @entity267 could do			0
well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little , ' they added			0
the claims were backed up by @entity274 himself , who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of @entity227			0
location : the militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at @entity283 yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of @entity285 and 40 miles west of @entity227			0
but the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the @entity227 suburbs on a mission : the @entity295 jets seek out their terror targets in @entity26 - which they failed to find and bomb , again in a message he also posted on @entity263 , @entity274 had said : ' the @entity3 are now within 10km of entering @entity227			2
over a 1000 @entity26 troops were killed by them yesterday , things are so bad			2
as i said all the military air strikes are doing nothing			0
if ever we needed your prayer it is now			0

@entity322 troops converted old tractors and lorries into military vehicles
they are badly out - gunned by @entity15 who seized weapons from the @entity26 army
in order to properly defend themselves , @entity18 armoured their own vehicles
result is a fleet of elaborately designed but well - defended battle buses
the vehicles bear a close resemblance to the vehicles in 1979 film @entity10
