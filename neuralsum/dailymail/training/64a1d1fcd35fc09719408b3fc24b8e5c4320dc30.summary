by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 16:35 est , 7 august 2013 sitting at the kitchen table , a pensive look on her face , i could tell my 11 - year - old granddaughter @entity6 had something on her mind			1
' do n't you like @entity10 ? ' she asked of my ex-husband , @entity11			1
' yes , i do like him , ' i replied			1
' then why are you divorced ? ' ' we like each other , ' i tried to explain , ' but we just do n't like living together			1
' as @entity6 tried to absorb this , with a puzzled look on her face , i felt a great sadness that two of her loving , doting grandparents could n't be the traditional granny and grandpa she would clearly love to have			1
' my ex and i love the grandchildren equally , but being divorced grandparents means everything has to be done separately ' the fact is , i am a prime example of that discomforting modern phenomenon : the divorced grandparent			1
unlike the grandparents of old , my ex-husband @entity11 and i do n't have a cosy , easy family home for our grandchildren			1
we ca n't offer what they would probably like : a safe , shared refuge , with deep old sofas for them to sink into and memories stretching back into our own childhoods			2
we can not give them the experience of two people who have grown old together , who have tolerated each other 's funny little ways , and who speak of each other with , mostly , affection			2
now that our five grandchildren are growing up - the eldest is 13 - it seems a tragic loss for them that they have to visit us separately in homes that are far from child - friendly			1
it also means , sadly , that they are forced to come to terms with divorce at an early age			2
when my husband @entity11 and i split up in 1988 , grandchildren were not even the merest speck on the horizon			1
it eventually became apparent that we could not co-exist under the same roof , so the divorce at least brought our bloodcurdling rows to an end			2
and once divorced , we got on fine			1
our two sons , @entity70 and @entity71 , teenagers at the time , seem to have lived their lives unaffected by it all			2
our grandchildren though - still lovely , fresh - faced , innocent young people - are another matter			1
my ex and i love the grandchildren equally , but being divorced grandparents means everything has to be done separately			1
@entity0 and @entity11 with their baby son @entity70 aged one week in april 1968 once , just once since they were born , we managed to take @entity71 's two children to @entity84 together - after months of planning and co-ordination			1
the kids absolutely loved being with both their grandparents , and we had enormous fun , too			2
joint grandparenting is so much more enjoyable than when you take them out alone			2
it 's jollier , more varied and less lonely for the adult			2
you can relive the event afterwards , together - in fact , my ex and i always talk about that wonderful day out on the occasions that we do speak			2
but it was never to be repeated			2
if i want to have my grandchildren to stay , i do so by myself			1
if @entity11 wants to take them to the seaside while they are with me , i drive them to the station to meet him , drop them off , then pick them up later , which is strange and unsettling for them			1
the reasons for this are both historical and logistical			2
by the time the grandchildren were born , @entity11 and i were living in different parts of the country , and could not easily get together anyway			1
i was also in another relationship and @entity11 remained resolutely single			1
now that my partner , @entity119 , has died , i know my grandchildren would secretly like @entity11 and me to be a nice elderly couple like their other grandparents			1
@entity0 with two of her grandchildren , @entity121 , left , and @entity123 , in @entity124 but even though my ex and i remain good friends , too much time has passed for this			1
it all means that we miss out on many milestones			2
i do n't think we have ever celebrated a grandchild 's birthday together - we 've been separated for so long that it would feel unnatural to be together at a family gathering			0
our sons have got used to scheduling us in separately			0
we 're fine when it 's just the two of us , but when the family are present , old slights , hurts and arguments come to the surface , reminding us why we separated			0
christmases are another difficult time			0
my sons always stay with their in - laws rather than descending on me , a lone grandparent living in an upstairs flat			0
i feel envious of @entity70 , who every year goes to a big house , where his mother - in - law organises picture - perfect family get - togethers			0
would i like to join in ? yes - i feel extremely left out			0
it would never even occur to either of my sons to come and stay with me or my ex - the atmosphere would never be the same - so i have never witnessed my grandchildren 's excited faces as they open their presents			1
they tell me about the games played , the walks with the cousins and the way they all reconnect			0
' we 're fine when it 's just the two of us , but when the family are present , old slights , hurts and arguments come to the surface , reminding us why we separated ' it would be a deprivation for the families to come to me - even if there was room for them all - so i have to be pleased that at least their other grandparents can give them a fantastic @entity173			0
it is all a stark contrast to the wonderful , simple relationship my sons and i used to have with my own grandparents			0
i was happy and relaxed in their home and always look back on them with love and gratitude			0
i saw my grandparents most days and loved to ' help ' my grandfather on his allotment			0
he would choose the smallest carrots and new potatoes for me and pick the sweetest peas			0
i chatted to him about @entity190 and to my gran about going into service at 12 years old			0
they never seemed to argue			0
at least , i tell myself , neither of us has remarried , so there is not a step - grandparent for them to get used to - the situation that faces @entity199 as he grows up			0
when my own grandchildren were born , i felt an overwhelming and completely unexpected outpouring of love for them			1
i am quite indifferent to all non-related babies , however cute they may be - they are not the flesh of my flesh and therefore there is no bond , no attachment			0
so i could not expect my partner , @entity119 , who was still alive when four of my grandchildren were born , to feel the same emotional tug			1
when you have a non-related partner , you ca n't do that delicious grandparently thing of cooing over the new baby together to see the family resemblances			0
nor will you have the same interest in poring over endless pictures of them , or laughing at their amusing little sayings			0
' it 's true that i may be a fun , modern , up - to - date granny with the latest computer - but i can never welcome them into the family home where their own parents grew up ' in the @entity232 , there have been rumours that @entity234 gets impatient with @entity236 's existing five grandchildren - no wonder ; he 's not their real grandfather			1
my grandchildren far prefer to stay with their other grandparents than with me or my ex. they are solid , traditional elderly couples who are still married and who have lived in the same house for decades			1
my heart sinks when @entity71 tells me they are going to @entity245 , where his wife 's parents live , as he does several times a year - it hurts to know the other grandparents have a much closer relationship with the children than i do			0
his mother - in - law is a wonderful old - fashioned granny , who loves to bake special cakes when she knows they are coming			0
@entity255 in - laws have lived in the same beautiful house for more than 40 years , and the grandchildren love to explore it			1
such grandparents , devoted to each other for life , are an increasingly rare breed , probably soon to be replaced by one biological grandparent and a step			0
and instead of remaining in family homes , the grandparents of tomorrow will move into smart new flats where they do n't like to cook in case it messes up the designer kitchen			0
it 's true that i may be a fun , modern , up - to - date granny with the latest computer , @entity275 and surround sound , and i can give them all sorts of treats			0
but i can never welcome them into the family home where their own parents grew up			0
and it saddens me beyond measure that this is the case .			0
