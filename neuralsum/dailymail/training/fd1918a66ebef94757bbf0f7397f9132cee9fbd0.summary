dangerous mindset : a senior figure close to @entity3 president @entity2 provoked outrage after claiming the @entity5 was a myth invented by the @entity6 a senior figure close to @entity3 president @entity2 provoked outrage today after claiming the @entity5 was a myth invented by the @entity6			1
@entity9 , who is responsible for appointing editors of all the state - run newspapers , claimed the six million @entity13 killed by @entity14 had actually been moved to @entity6			1
his comments came as the world marked @entity17 on sunday and little more than a week after it emerged that president @entity2 himself had once described @entity13 as ' descendants of apes and pigs '			1
@entity9 said : ' the myth of the @entity5 is an industry that @entity6 invented			1
' @entity6 intelligence agencies in co-operation with their counterparts in allied nations during @entity28 created it [ the @entity5 ] to destroy the image of their opponents in @entity32 and to justify war and massive destruction against military and civilian facilities of the @entity37 , and especially to hit @entity38 and @entity39 with the atomic bomb			2
' his views have sparked fears that the @entity3 government , like @entity45 's , has significant elements that refuse to acknowledge one of the best - documented genocides in history			1
the bizarre claims will also be especially concerning for @entity51 , which had fostered good relations with president @entity2 's predecessor , @entity53 , who was ousted in 2011 following days of violent protests			2
@entity55 , @entity51 director of the @entity57 - based @entity56 , whose mission is to defend against anti-semitism and teach the lessons of the @entity5 to future generations , told @entity62 that @entity9 's views showed a dangerous mindset			2
he said : ' obviously , if a person in that position makes that ridiculous claim it is of concern			0
' the sad truth is that these views are relatively common in the @entity72 world and are the result of ignorance on one hand and of government - sponsored @entity5 denial on the other hand			0
' disturbing : his comments came as the world marked @entity17 on sunday , being respected here by a member of @entity85 's @entity13 community in a cemetery in @entity87 earlier this month , the @entity88 condemned president @entity2 after it was revealed he had described @entity13 as ‘ descendants of apes and pigs ’			1
the @entity93 leader is also reported to have asked @entity3 to ‘ nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred ’			0
in other comments , he said @entity99 are bloodsuckers who attack @entity101 and are related to apes			0
the remarks were made three years ago , but have only recently emerged			0
threat to peace ? @entity105 - @entity9 's views also come just days after the @entity88 condemned @entity3 president @entity2 ( pictured ) for describing @entity13 as ' descendants of apes and pigs ' president @entity108 ’s @entity88 spokesman @entity107 said : ‘ the language that we have seen is deeply offensive			1
‘ we completely reject these statements , as we do any language that espouses religious hatred			0
‘ this kind of discourse has been acceptable in the region for far too long , and is counter to the goal of peace			0
’ @entity2 ’s remarks and the @entity108 administration ’s rebuke marked a new point of tension in the complex relationship between the @entity6 and @entity3 ’s fledgling democracy			1
since being elected in june of 2012 in the aftermath of the revolution that ousted former president @entity53 , @entity2 has promised to abide by @entity3 ’s decades - old peace treaty with @entity51			2
@entity2 was also instrumental in facilitating a ceasefire in november between @entity51 and @entity131 leaders in the @entity132 , despite his refusal to speak directly with @entity51 officials			0
but despite this , there are fears that @entity2 may prove to be a radical @entity138			0
he has already provoked a war with more democratic elements within @entity3 over a new constitution which grants him far - reaching powers .			2

@entity105 - @entity9 claims @entity6 used myth to destroy image of the @entity146
comes after it emerged @entity2 had described @entity13 as ' descendents of pigs '
raises fears @entity3 government has major elements that deny genocide
