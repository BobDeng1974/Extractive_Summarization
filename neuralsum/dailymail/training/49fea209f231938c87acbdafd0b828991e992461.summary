the first ever record of an oceanic shark giving birth has been uncovered by scientists			2
the photo , taken off @entity4 in the @entity5 , reveals the body of an elusive baby thresher shark emerging from its mother			1
but the image by @entity11 photographer , @entity10 , was left lying in a junk computer folder for years after biologists failed to spot its significance			1
the photo , taken in the @entity5 several in 2013 , reveals the body of an elusive baby thresher shark emerging from its mother while researchers know that most shark species give birth to live young , the conditions under which they do so has been a mystery			1
researchers believe this image could help shed light on how and where sharks give birth			1
lead researcher dr @entity34 from the @entity35 told @entity36 that seeing the image was one of the most exciting moments of his career			1
the shark was at a seamount – or undersea mountain – which acts as an area where the creatures can clean themselves by having parasites eaten away by smaller fish wrasse			0
the image was captured off @entity4 in in the @entity49 , 4.2 miles ( 6.8km ) across a shallow strait from the northernmost tip of @entity52 for sharks , there is no place like home			1
this is especially true when these magnificent creatures want to give birth after having wandered far and wide across the planet ’s oceans for several years at time			1
a 20 - year study , conducted in the @entity63 , shows that despite their impressive travels , female lemon sharks always return to the same location where they were born to give birth			1
the idea of females returning to their place of birth has been shown in a number of marine species , including salmon and sea turtles			0
the international team , who reported their findings in the journal @entity80 , said this is the first time this behaviour has been seen sharks			0
‘ we used each shark ’s individual dna fingerprint to construct a large family tree , ’ explained dr @entity84 at @entity85 and the lead author of the study			0
‘ we found that new born sharks captured in the mid- 1990s left the safety of the islands when they were between five and eight years old			2
' we observed a large female pelagic thresher shark swimming back and forth across a cleaning station in an agitated state , ' dr @entity34 wrote in the journal @entity100			1
' we were unable to decipher the cause of the shark 's distress from our observation post 50ft ( 15 metres ) away , although it was evident that cleaner wrasse were taking bites from its pelvic region			0
' we observed the shark for a total of four minutes , during which we took its photograph for identification purposes			0
' researchers believe that this area also serves as a pupping ground , and that images of more sharks giving birth could be taken in the future			2
@entity122 creatures are endangered as a result of human activities			0
sharks live a long time and take many years to mature , which is one reason why they are extremely vulnerable to overfishing ' it may well be , or at least the first time that the event has been photographed , but this is always difficult to say definitively , ' dr @entity129 , a senior scientist from @entity130 in @entity131 told the @entity36			1
thresher sharks , also known as fox sharks , received their name due to their predatory habits			0
unlike other shark species , thresher sharks use their whip - like tail to swat - and - swipe at schools of fish , allowing them to stun and eat their prey			0
but these creatures are endangered as a result of human activities			0
sharks live a long time and take many years to mature , which is one reason why they are extremely vulnerable to overfishing all three thresher shark species are listed as either ' threatened ' or ' vulnerable ' to extinction by the @entity156			2
dr @entity129 that the photograph , while shedding light on these mysterious creatures , may be of ' limited importance ' when it comes to shark conservation			2
all three thresher shark species are listed as either ' threatened ' or ' vulnerable ' to extinction by the @entity156			0

the *remarkable* image was taken off @entity4 in the @entity5
after being *overlooked* for several years , researcher dr @entity34 said seeing the image was one of the most exciting moments of his career
the photo could help shed light on how and where sharks give birth
