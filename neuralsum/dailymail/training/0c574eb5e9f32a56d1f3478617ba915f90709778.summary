actress @entity0 today defended her decision to stop chemotherapy , insisting she had not ' chosen to die ' @entity0 says she has not ' chosen to die ' , despite the fact she plans to stop having chemotherapy for bowel cancer			1
the 66 - year - old actress has spoken at length in the past fortnight about her diagnosis and treatment , since announcing her condition was terminal			1
today she said she had taken the decision about chemotherapy while at her wit 's end with the pain and side effects of the treatment - and had wanted to get some control back over her life			1
appearing on @entity21 's @entity20 , she said : ' i have n't decided to die at all , no. ' i just sat down when i was in pain - there 's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat , the thrush , plus the fact i 'd had major , life - saving surgery for a perforated colon			1
' when you 're in terrible pain , you make decisions			0
' she told hosts @entity37 and @entity39 : ' i want my husband and children to see me off happy , contented			0
' so i put the chemotherapy in a box			2
' in this box , i could stop the chemotherapy after @entity44 - i 'm determined to hang on until @entity44			1
' if my quality of life fades after that , i want to be able to open the box , make a choice and stop the chemotherapy			1
' she said before this , she 'd had no control over the decision - but had struggled with the idea of refusing treatment offered			1
' i do n't want to look ungrateful , ' she explained			0
' the box [ decision ] is there to be used if i need it			2
' if my quality of life remains as it is now [ after @entity44 ] , then why would i hasten my death ? ' yesterday , appearing on @entity62 , she explained she had the option to resume treatment if her health improves			1
' it 's there on the table if i want it , ' she said			2
@entity0 also admitted today there were times when she lay awake wondering about the future			2
speaking about her new book , there 's something i 've been dying to tell you , she said : ' the book is for everyone - every single day people are going through this			1
' as my oncologist says , the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist			0
' there 's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat , the thrush , plus the fact i 'd had major , life - saving surgery for a perforated colon , ' she said @entity0 , with husband @entity99 outside the @entity21 studios today , said the positive thing about having a long - term condition such as cancer meant she 'd had time to talk and spend time with her family ' it 's not a book going " oooh , i 've for cancer "			1
it 's positive - grasp what people give you and turn everything around to be positive			1
' for example , she added that having a long - term condition such as cancer had at least given her time to talk and enjoy time with her family , as well as make plans			1
' to lose someone suddenly must be devastating - that is worse , ' she said			2
' my family and i have had lots of chats , time to talk - you realise sometimes when you are a parent you do n't ever really talk to your children			1
' she said the topic of death had also been discussed			2
' as a society , we never talk about it , we never face it - even though it 's everywhere			1
we must talk about death			1
sit down , get your wills out the way			0
@entity0 is now trying to get more people to talk about ' unsexy ' conditions such as bowel cancer , and even joked about emptying her colostomy bag at @entity142 after collecting her obe ' people spend their last few months worrying about death , but not pinpointing [ what it is about death ] they are worried about - rather than focusing on everything they 've got			1
' the prognosis , she said , had made her more vocal and empowered			0
' i 'm able to tell people what i really think , ' she laughed			2
she is also on a mission to speak about the unspeakable - bowel habits and bowel cancer - to sweep way the embarrassment surrounding the condition that often costs lives			1
' bowel cancer and bottoms are n't sexy , ' she said			2
to prove a point , she even divulged details of her trip to the loo at @entity142 when collecting her obe			0
' when i visited the royal toilet , i took my cream suede shoes off just in case			0
' this was to protect them while emptied her colostomy bag - nicknamed @entity172 , which , she added , makes a ' tweeting noise - rather than a raspberry noise '			2
' these things must n't be embarrassing - they are part of life , ' @entity0 added			1
' for me , if two of three people read this and feel less alone , then i 'm happy			2
' when praised about her openness and honesty in discussing her cancer , she joked : ' after five years on @entity188 [ the chat show where she was a panellist ] , everything knows everything about you anyway			0
' people should be able to trust you			2
@entity195 forbid i do n't die for another couple of years [ after all this ] ! ' she added the response to her speaking out about her diagnosis had been ' overwhelming '			0
' it keeps an old girl going , ' she joked			0
' lots of people want you to console them , which is interesting , and you think " should n't it be the other way round " ? when asked if she was bitter about her diagnosis , she simply said : ' do n't go there			0
' there is no point			0
i was stage four from day one , and people have been so kind			0
' instead , i want to be happy and talk			0
' chemotherapy treatment causes side effects because it kills some normal cells as well as cancer cells chemotherapy causes side effects because drugs that kill dividing cancer cells , also kill other normal cells in the body that divide too			1
these include cells in the skin , hair and nails			0
the mouth , the lining of the digestive system and bone marrow are also affected			0
common side - effects of chemotherapy include : tiredness treatment can cause tiredness , lethargy and fatigue which may last for quite a few months after the treatment ends			1
sickness many chemotherapy drugs cause nausea or vomiting , but this can usually be controlled with anti sickness medicines			0
mouth ulcers some drugs can make the lining of the mouth sore and cause mouth ulcers diarrhoea or constipation this usually happens in the first few days after treatment			1
increased risk of infection chemotherapy drugs stops the bone marrow from making enough blood cells which leaves a person more at risk of catching infections that can be quite serious			0
hair , skin and nails chemotherapy treatment can make hair fall out , make your skin dry , sensitive and prone to rashes			0
some people find their nails become dry , ridged and brittle			0
nerves numbness in the hands and feet , which sometimes feels like pins and needles is common because drugs can damage nerves			0
sex and fertility people often feel tired and lose their libido when undergoing chemotherapy			1
some drugs also affect fertility			0
