the @entity0 has never been richer , with the most recent combined annual income for the current 20 clubs soaring past £ 3billion for the first time			1
but a review of the books by the @entity6 also shows club debts standing at more than £ 2.5 billion			1
much of that poses no imminent danger to the clubs encumbered with it			0
@entity12 ’s parent company owes @entity13 £ 958million , for example , and he is showing no sign of demanding it back any time soon			1
@entity17 have debts of £ 342m as a result of the leveraged takeover almost 10 years ago by the @entity21 but can service it comfortably , while @entity23 have ‘ good debt ’ of £ 241m , borrowed to fund their stadium			2
taking their cash pile into consideration they had only £ 33m of net debt at the end of the last financial year			2
@entity13 is owed an astonishing £ 958million by @entity12 's parent company @entity32 , on the other hand , are nearly debt - free after being sensibly run over a long period but a group of clubs including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 have each racked up debt of around £ 100m , much of which is owed to their owners			1
and in an era when the @entity0 has never had so much cash it is bewildering so many clubs remain financially unstable and potentially in peril should they get relegated			2
the ‘ boom - and - bust culture ’ of unsustainable spending in an attempt to buy success underpins the phenomenon , according to the chief executive of one of the clubs most sensibly run over a long period , @entity32			1
‘ the easiest thing to do when you reach the @entity0 is over-reach , ’ says @entity32 ’s @entity58 , whose club have just posted their latest set of profitable accounts and are close to being debt - free			1
@entity17 have debts of £ 342m as a result of the leveraged takeover almost 10 years ago @entity32 played @entity69 's @entity68 in the 2008 @entity70 - a team guilty of ' boom and bust ' ‘ everyone puts you under enormous pressure to just chuck endless money at it , ’ he adds			1
‘ you ’ve got to be strong enough to withstand that pressure and the flak that comes with it if you do n’t have the spending level			0
‘ you can get sucked into a boom - and - bust culture			1
that ’s drained the pockets of many a star - struck or misguided owner			0
’ examples of clubs that aimed for the stars but have ended up in administration or other self - inflicted fiscal turmoil are numerous			0
@entity90 , @entity39 , @entity91 and @entity92 spring readily to mind			0
but it is another example , @entity68 , that most irks @entity32 , who lost to a ‘ financially doped ’ @entity68 in the 2008 @entity70 semi-finals			1
@entity68 went on to win the trophy before a spectacular meltdown caused by the unsustainable spending undertaken to assemble and pay @entity69 ’s squad at that time			2
@entity68 were flying high and eventually won the @entity70 , but are now mid-table in the fourth division @entity32 say they are still frustrated at losing to a team @entity68 ' basically could n't afford ' ‘ it still pinches us at @entity32 that we lost our last @entity70 semi-final to a team the opposition basically could n’t afford , ’ said @entity58			1
‘ our fans went home miserable that night			0
i suspect they would want to swap places now though			0
’ @entity68 are now mid-table in the fourth tier			0
@entity32 are looking increasingly likely to be safe in the top flight for a fifth year running			0
some of their fans may feel they should be taking more risks with bigger - name players but @entity58 insists stability is key			2
‘ we have shown — along with one or two other clubs — that it is possible to compete in the @entity0 by building , building , building — sensibly , year on year , ’ he says			2
‘ you ’re adding to the squad , the club ’s infrastructure , sticking to your business plan , trying to get right as many decisions as you can while knowing that some things will go wrong because that is the nature of football			0
‘ the key thing is if and when that happens you are not so over-stretched that it becomes a catastrophe			0
