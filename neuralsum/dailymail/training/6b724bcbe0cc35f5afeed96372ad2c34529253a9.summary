' i did n't see anything at all but just felt and heard the big smack on my head , ' ms @entity8 told @entity25			1
' covered in her own blood the teenager said she was rushed out of the crowd by two of her friends - @entity42 and @entity43 - when the trio were fortunate enough to bump into first aid officers			1
they took ms @entity8 to the medical tent but paramedics had trouble stopping the bleeding , estimating she had lost more than half a litre of blood due to the injury			1
a medic put four stitches in her head on the spot , and the 19 - year - old will likely be left with a permanent scar from the injury			2

' looking back on it it 's terrifying			0
i was really just having a great time and out of no where it happened , ' the @entity10 woman added			2

' seeing the blood down my arm and legs made me understand the seriousness off it			0
during the time i was pretty light headed and dizzy as well			0
' paramedics had trouble stopping the bleeding and estimated ms @entity8 lost more than half a litre of blood the injury has ruined her family holiday to @entity100 , and means she wont be able to participate in any activities she was looking forward to ms @entity8 said @entity42 saw the bottle that hit her - identifying it as a small container of @entity105 's whiskey			1
