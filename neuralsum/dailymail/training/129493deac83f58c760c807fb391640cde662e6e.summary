by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:17 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 12 december 2013 jurors who look up details of their case online should be prosecuted , the government ’s top lawyer has warned			0
attorney general @entity7 said members of juries must not try to find out about defendants by searching the internet			1
and he wanted against trawling ‘ chat and banter ’ about cases on @entity16 or @entity17 or be charged with contempt of court			0
crackdown : jurors are told not to search online for details of cases , and if they are caught trials can collapse at great cost to the taxpayer ( file picture ) in a speech to think - tank @entity26 , mr @entity24 backed plans by the @entity28 to create a criminal offence for jurors who intentionally seek information beyond the evidence presented in court			1
it follows a number of cases in which jurors have been jailed for using the internet to find more information about cases than was set out in court			1
jurors have always been told by judges at the start of cases not to carry out their own research , discuss it with anyone , visit the scene of the crime or try to find out about the witnesses or defendants			1
these directions now extend to not researching the case on the internet			2
@entity7 said members of juries must not try to find out about defendants by searching the internet and backed plans to make it a criminal offence mr @entity7 said : ‘ to ignore those directions , intentionally , amounts to a contempt of court			1
‘ this does not mean that jurors must refrain from reading the news - online or in the traditional way - , nor that they should not use the internet as they would normally			1
‘ it means that they must not seek out extraneous information about the case they have sworn to try in accordance with the evidence			0
’ he said there will be ‘ all kinds of prejudicial information “ out there ” on the internet ’			1
‘ this could be in the form of archived news reports about the defendant ’s previous court appearances , or it could be , to use the words of the old authorities in a modern context , mere chaff and banter about the case on someone ’s @entity16 page or @entity17 feed			0
‘ but the chances of a juror seeing such material are fairly slim , providing they have n’t gone looking for it			0
’ he highlighted the case of @entity96 who was jailed for six months in 2012 after causing a trial to be stopped because she researched a defendant ’s past on the internet			0
the lecturer was a juror in the case of a man accused of grievous bodily harm , and after looking on the web discovered he had previously been acquitted of rape – information not given during his assault trial at @entity112			2
@entity113 shared her findings with her fellow jurors who informed the judge – and the trial of @entity119 , 64 , a violent drinker , was halted			0
at the time the lord chief justice said : ‘ the problem is not the internet : the potential problems arise from the activities of jurors who disregard the long established principles which underpin the right of every citizen to a fair trial			2
’ but @entity7 said he endorsed the remarks , adding : ‘ my recent experience is that the law of contempt is both adaptable and resilient in the face of the challenges of technology			2
‘ the fundamental principles underlying the need for juror restraint are timeless			0

@entity7 backs call for new criminal offence of researching cases
jurors can read news coverage of cases but must not trawl the web
there is ' all kinds of prejudicial information “ out there ” on the internet '
