horrific dilemma : @entity7 chose to leap 20ft from a window to escape a sex attacker @entity7 , 20 , admitted she may have been ' naive ' about @entity12 , 29 , in the past when he had made references to them being a couple as she carried out her duties at the home where he was a patient			1
then one day when she was helping him with his medication , he locked her in a medication room with him			0
@entity7 recalled : ' i had my back to him but i heard the sound of the door being locked and knew something was n't right			1
i tried to be normal and to stay clam and professional			0

' she added : ' i managed to fight him off , we had tug of war with the bathroom door but i managed with all my strength to lock it			0
' i had my phone and was trying to call the police but i was so frightened i could n't dial			0

' nightmare : the care home worker shared her story on this morning			1
