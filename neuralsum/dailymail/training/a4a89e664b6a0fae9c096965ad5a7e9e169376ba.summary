by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 blasted into space three years ago is set to return to @entity4 next month			1
the experiment could reveal how gravity affects how alcohol matures and tastes in space			1
the @entity9 on the @entity11 island of @entity12 , sent compounds of unmatured malt to the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) in an unmanned cargo spacecraft in october 2011 , along with particles of charred oak			1
drink up ! the @entity9 on the @entity11 island of @entity12 , sent compounds of unmatured malt to the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) in an unmanned cargo spacecraft in october 2011 , along with particles of charred oak			1
the sample is held aloft before launch by dr @entity22 ( left ) and a bottle is pictured , right scientists hope to understand how they interact at close - to - zero gravity			2
the vial of specially - designed whisky has been orbiting the @entity4 's atmosphere at 17,227mph , 15 times a day for 1,045 days			2
during which time , an identical bottle has sat untouched at the distillery to act as a control sample			2
the single malt is expected to land back on solid ground in @entity35 aboard a rocket on september 12			1
the two samples will then be reunited at a laboratory in @entity39 , @entity40 , where scientists will compare them to examine the interaction of the molecules with charred oak , to see what differences occur between @entity4 whisky and space whisky			0
space booze : the vial of specially - designed whisky has been orbiting the @entity4 's atmosphere at 17,227mph , 15 times a day for 1,045 days aboard the @entity15 ( pictured ) ‘ @entity9 is known for taking risks in its development of some of the most coveted whiskies in the world , so it is fitting that it is the first distillery ever in space , said dr @entity22 , @entity9 's director of distilling and whisky creation			1
‘ we are now close to the end , close to finding answers to something previously unknown which is truly exciting			0
‘ this is one small step for man but one giant leap for whisky , and the team hope to uncover how flavours develop in different gravitational conditions - findings which could revolutionise the whisky - making process			0
‘ we hope to shine new light on the effect of gravity on the maturation process but who knows where it will lead us ? it could be to infinity and beyond			2
’ astronauts and cosmonauts have consumed alcohol in space from @entity93 ’s famous ‘ communion on the moon ’ to blurry footage of @entity88 cosmonauts knocking back some cognac on @entity90			1
before @entity94 and @entity93 boarded the lunar module on july 20 1969 , @entity93 unstowed a small piece of bread and a tiny container of wine from @entity101 presbyterian church near @entity39 and took communion , which was hushed up at the time			0
he reportedly remarked that the liquid swirled and ran up the side of the small chalice			0
@entity90 cosmonaut @entity107 told @entity108 that cognac was provided among the medical kit and was prescribed to cosmonauts ‘ to stimulate our immune system and on the whole keep our organisms in tone			0
’ in the early 1970s , @entity118 , together with experts from the @entity117 , sought to develop wine that could be consumed on the @entity121 ’s first space station , @entity122			0
having tested numerous ideas , they settled upon sherry as the perfect spacey alcoholic beverage because if its stability and strong taste			0
@entity129 has been grown on the @entity15 and used to produce limited edition ‘ space beer ’ which was sold in @entity132 for around $ 19 a bottle and a lavish pr stunt saw one vodka manufacturer board a vomit comet to mix a cocktail by spinning his whole body around to shake the drink up			1
the two samples will then be reunited at a laboratory in @entity39 , @entity40 , where scientists will compare them to examine the interaction of the molecules with charred oak , to see what differences occur between @entity4 whisky and space whisky			0
