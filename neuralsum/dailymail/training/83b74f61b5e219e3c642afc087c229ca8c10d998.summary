it may look like an innocuous ballpoint , but despite being disguised to look like a @entity4 pen it is actually a deadly weapon employed by a @entity7 spy in an assassination attempt last year			1
like something straight out of a @entity11 film , the pen actually contains a deadly poison which , if injected , leads to almost instant muscle paralysis which in turn leads to suffocation and death			2
the weapon , demonstrated to @entity19 reporters by @entity21 's answer to @entity22 , was one of three found on a would - be assassin in @entity25 who was targeting @entity26 , an anti @entity7 activist			1
deadly : these innocuous looking pens are actually weapons employed by a would - be @entity7 assassin assigned to kill @entity26 , a pro-democracy activist sneaky : the pen actually injects a toxin which causes muscle paralyses and death within minutes potent : a second ' pen ' weapon fires a poison - filled bullet which can pierce the skin as well as the poison pen , @entity7 authorities also found a second weapon disguised as a @entity4 pen - but this time with a couple of clicks it fires a poison - filled bullet which can pierce the skin			1
the third is a flashlight , loaded with up to three bullets which , when demonstrated by forensics experts on camera , demonstrated extraordinary accuracy and effectiveness			0
although the unnamed @entity21 intelligence officer filmed says that the pen weapons are nothing new - @entity7 authorities have been using them for at least a decade , he says - the flashlight is completely new			1
and , far from matching the unmistakable intent of carrying a pistol , the trio of weapons are practically undetectable			0
new : a @entity21 intelligence officer , whose identity was hidden by @entity19 , said that he had never seen a weapon such as this , disguised as an innocuous torch subterfuge : instead of shining a light when switched on , the torch fires a bullet at its target testing : forensics experts demonstrated what damage the torch weapon could potentially inflict on target : the torch weapon was shown to be alarmingly accurate and deadly the would - be assassin was arrested while allegedly on his way to kill @entity26 , a former propaganda unit worker for the @entity81 until 1999 when his father , a government spy , urged his family to defect to @entity21			1
fighting for democracy in his homeland ever since , @entity84 is chairman of @entity89 , an organisation behind the release of two million balloons containing human rights and pro-democracy propaganda into @entity7			0
he was understandably shocked when shown the weapons which were almost used to try and kill him			0
he told @entity19 : ' you 'd notice a gun , but these weapons are so innocuous , you can easily kill someone , i 'd be dead immediately			0
' i did n't believe they 'd try and kill me on the crowded streets of @entity25 , i thought the @entity105 was over-reacting			2
' now given round - the - clock police protection , @entity26 says that he is undeterred in his fight for democracy despite the subterfuge tactics employed by those said to be out to get him			2
his would - be killer , named simply as @entity113 , was sentenced to four years in jail earlier this year			0
frisked : the weapons were found on a would - be @entity7 assassin who was targeting high profile pro-democracy campaigner @entity26 disguised : the @entity21 intelligence officer who demonstrated the weapons had his identity protected by @entity19			1

three deadly weapons were demonstrated by a @entity21 intelligence officer
the weapons were to be used in the assassination of *prominent* pro-democracy campaigner @entity26 in @entity25
