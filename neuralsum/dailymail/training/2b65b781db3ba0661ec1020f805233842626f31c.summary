@entity0 will go down in @entity2 folklore after the @entity4 club made history on monday			1
the @entity7 goalkeeper conceded the only goal of the game , making a terrible hash of @entity12 ’s long - range free - kick as @entity2 won a tight @entity14 play - off final and clinched promotion to @entity16 for the first time			1
the great rise : @entity2 have been promoted for the sixth time in nine years triumph : goalscorer @entity12 celebrates with his winners medal after the game glory : @entity2 celebrate after scoring direct from a free kick late on misjudged : @entity24 goalkeeper @entity0 fails to stop the free kick from @entity12 @entity7 : @entity0 , @entity25 , @entity26 ( @entity27 65 ) , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity31 73 ) , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 78 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37			1

@entity2 ’s rise up the @entity66 football ladder has been remarkable			1
this third incarnation of the west @entity4 club was only born in 1997 when they entered the 10th tier of @entity66 football in @entity74 of the @entity76 six promotions in the past nine years , their ascent has also been rapid			2
that success has come since chairman @entity78 took over in 2003			0
back then , @entity2 ’s @entity79 had windows falling in and @entity78 ’s first game in charge drew 80 spectators			1
manager @entity40 , appointed in 2012 , explained : ‘ it all comes down to the ambition of the chairman			1
we ’re always believing we can smash through any glass ceilings on top of us			0
‘ we ’re proving we can achieve			0
that ’s what the chairman spoke to me about when i came here			0
it ’s down to a lot of people pulling in the same direction			0
you ’ve got to have that drive			0
’ tussle : @entity35 of @entity24 ( left ) battles with @entity29 at @entity99 fleetwood are based in a small fishing town , five miles north of @entity102 , with a population of less than 30,000			2
it took the club just two seasons to make it out of @entity14 after spending only two in the @entity109			2
and when they went up to @entity14 in 2012 it was the first time , since the club originated in 1908 , that they had ever been in the @entity112			1
victory will be celebrated on the @entity115 coast but for @entity7 it was a terrible way to lose such an important match — and @entity0 will be keen to forget it quickly			0
with 15 minutes left , @entity2 won a seemingly innocuous free - kick 35 yards from goal out on the left			1
midfielder @entity12 , who was at @entity123 ’s youth academy between the age of seven and 15 , sent a high ball into the box			1
@entity0 dashed from his goal to claim it , ran too far and then could only flap at the ball as it sailed over his head and in			0
surrounded : @entity52 takes a shot on goal in the first - half , bombarded by @entity24 players out - muscled : @entity136 falls to the ground as he vies for the ball with @entity49 support : @entity2 fans were looking for yet another promotion faithful : @entity24 fans cheer on their side ahead of the match at @entity99 it was @entity12 ’s 15th goal of the season and probably the one he least expected to see go in the net , but @entity24 manager @entity150 refused to blame his keeper			1
‘ i told him to get his chin up , ’ said @entity150			0
‘ unfortunately , a lot of these games we ’ve seen in the last few weeks — play - off finals , the @entity159 final — often a mistake dictates the result and defines a close game			2
that ’s what it did			0
‘ @entity0 ’s been excellent			0
i ca n’t be disappointed with him , he ’s going to be disappointed enough with himself			0
he ’s got to learn from it			0
’ in the end , it was a deserved win			2
@entity2 were unlucky not to go ahead in the opening two minutes when striker @entity52 had a ferocious shot pushed over			1
from the resulting corner he got his head to the cross only four yards out but @entity0 somehow got his body behind the ball to keep it out .			0

@entity12 scores with 15 minutes remaining at @entity99
@entity40 *'s* @entity2 are promoted for the sixth time in nine years
@entity176 will play in @entity14 next term , after the win in front of *14,000*
