some beauty products are centuries old — virtually unchanged since 19th - century apothecaries came up with the formulation , and still on our chemists ’ shelves			1
but do they stand the test of time when pitted against modern counterparts ? we put some bestsellers to the test ... 1911 @entity12 , £ 3.50 2013 @entity13 with @entity14 15 , £ 14.99 an emulsifying agent named @entity16 was the basis for @entity12 , a product that its makers claimed was ‘ the first stable water - in - oil skin cream ’			1
last year , the brand launched the @entity23 range , ‘ to boost the skin ’s surface cell renewal for a more youthful look ’			1
@entity27 in 1911 ( left ) and 2013 @entity28 with @entity14 ( right ) the verdict : there does n’t seem much evidence to substantiate claims for cell renewal , but the newer product did feel superior			1
it smelt like a slightly more perfumed version of classic @entity12 , went on more easily and was more quickly absorbed , which @entity38 cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity37 put down to the shea butter it contains			1
however , five minutes after i ’d applied them there was little to choose between the two			1
‘ the addition of sunscreen filters gives the updated version a clear advantage , ’ says dr @entity37			1
‘ but for those with very dry skin , plain old @entity12 is excellent value for money			1
just do n’t skimp on sunscreen afterwards			1
’ the winner : original — it ’s less than a quarter of the price and can be used night and day if you put an @entity14 on top			1
1953 @entity60 , £ 5.99 2007 @entity61 , £ 12.99 although normally used these days as a powder on top of foundation , the @entity60 was launched as an all - in - one base and powder			1
more than 50 years later , @entity67 , which ‘ transforms on contact with the skin from a solid foundation into a lightweight supple liquid ’ , was launched			1
the verdict : both products gave a matte finish but the @entity60 did n’t offer as much coverage and left skin looking flat and powdery			1
i know a lot of people love its retro smell but i ’m not a fan			1
the winner : new — as a foundation @entity67 definitely wins , but the @entity60 is good for removing shine on the go			1
1953 @entity87 ( left ) and 2007 @entity88 ( right ) 1863 @entity89 , £ 7.99 2013 @entity90 , £ 7.99 when @entity93 actor @entity92 started making stage make - up , he created a blusher by mixing powder with water and mother - of - pearl , then baking it in a mould			2
@entity89 has been in production ever since			2
in 2013 , it was reinvented as a cream - to - powder formulation			2
the verdict : the packaging of the newer blush is about half the size as it does n’t contain a brush or applicator — you just use your fingers			2
but it lacks the original ’s sweet rose scent and has a similarly powdery finish			2
the winner : original — it comes in 12 shades , smells divine and is as blendable as the new version			2
@entity119 , £ 7.99 ( left ) and the same product in 2013 ( right ) which is the same price 1930 @entity121 , £ 26 2009 @entity122 eight hour @entity123 , £ 30 2009 @entity122 eight hour @entity123 , £ 30 this blend of lanolin , petroleum jelly and paraffin got its name from a customer who claimed that the cream helped to heal her son ’s scraped knee in eight hours			2
almost 80 years later , a moisturiser was launched promising moisturising for up to eight hours as well as protection from extreme weather and sun. the verdict : eight hour cream is a thick , waxy balm with a strong , almost medicinal scent that people either love or hate			1
you would n’t normally apply it over your whole face but it ’s undeniably good for dry lips and cuticles			2
i find it too greasy to use as hand cream			2
the new moisturiser has a lighter , fresher scent and absorbs easily			2
dr @entity37 warns that the combination of sun filters might not protect you all day			2
the winner : original — if you do n’t mind the smell , it will help to lock in moisture			2
1960 @entity165 , from £ 2.39 2014 @entity166 , from £ 2.39 before @entity165 , which was designed to be strong enough to fix hairstyles yet allow movement , hair lacquer was exactly that — it set hard			1
in 1969 a micro-diffusion cap was added to give a finer spray			0
the latest version , @entity166 , contains particles that give texture and lift to mimic a backcombed effect			0
a 1960s @entity180 @entity179 magazine advert for @entity165 ( left ) and 2014 @entity182 hairspray , £ 2.39 ( right ) the verdict : true to its promise , the original holds but brushes out easily			0
the newer version also holds and , according to trichologist @entity187 , does so more effectively			0
volume excess is designed to be used like dry shampoo — sprayed in and brushed out , leaving behind particles that create volume and grip			0
unless you really do n’t want volume , the new one offers all the hold of the original , plus extra oomph			0
and as we wash our hair more frequently now , who cares if it does n’t brush out as easily ? 1870 @entity204 , £ 2.80 2014 @entity205 , £ 3.29 @entity204 was developed after a chemist noticed workers on an oil rig using a refinery by - product to heal cuts and burns			1
the latest version is a body lotion infused with micro-droplets of the original petroleum jelly			0
in clinical tests , it was shown to provide twice as much moisture as @entity221 cream			0
the verdict : both products are fragrance - free but while the original is thick and waxy , the cream soaks quite easily into the skin			1
‘ plain old @entity228 will lock in moisture , ’ says dr @entity37 , ‘ but it will make a mess of a blouse , so apply only to lips and ultra-dry areas such as heels or elbows at night			0
’ the winner : new — just as moisturising but far more practical			0
an advert for @entity204 the 1910s shows how it came in a tube ( left ) while @entity242 , £ 3.29 , ( right ) now comes in a plastic tub			1
the recent product is deemed ' far more practical ' 1950 @entity245 , £ 4.99 2014 @entity246 , £ 21.99 @entity245 was devised by a @entity248 chemist whose wife was frustrated by thick , greasy creams			0
the latest @entity245 launch , @entity246 , contains ingredients that claim to give firmer , younger - looking skin			0
the verdict : both products are easily absorbed , although the @entity245 left skin feeling a little sticky in comparison , and smelt slightly old - fashioned			1
but according to @entity259 , it ’s the ingredients that count			0
‘ high levels of niacinamide , known to boost barrier function and even out skin tone , make the new cream a hugely improved formulation			0
’ the winner : new — why would n’t you pick a more sophisticated moisturiser with proven antiageing ingredients ? an advert in the 1950s for @entity245 shows how products came in a round tub ( left ) while the 2014 @entity275 , £ 21.99 , is packaged in a box			1
the new product is deemed the ' more sophisticated ' 1967 @entity278 , £ 3.99 2012 @entity279 , £ 5.49 this waxy concealer was a @entity282 bestseller — but concealers evolved from stick to cream formulations and in 2012 @entity286 launched its @entity287 product , which promises an ‘ instant anti-fatigue effect ’ under the eyes and complete coverage for spots and other blemishes			0
the verdict : the original feels greasy and cakey and does n’t blend easily into the skin			0
its coverage did n’t seem great unless it was applied and then set with powder			0
the new formulation goes on smoothly and has a finish that is n’t so shiny that it makes spots stand out			1
the winner : new — the @entity282 version feels inferior			0
2012 @entity279 , £ 5.49 ( left ) and @entity307 ’s @entity306 ( right ) 1954 @entity307 ’s @entity308 , £ 3.35 for 500ml 2013 @entity307 ’s @entity306 , £ 3.13 for 250ml this was the first product formulated to be as mild to a baby ’s eyes as water — hence ‘ no more tears ’			0
the latest shampoo , which comes in a pump dispenser , was launched last year			0
the verdict : the original shampoo is simple and effective			0
its smell is unremarkable , unlike the new one which has a fruity , apple fragrance			0
according to trichologist @entity187 , though , the formulations are n’t that different			0
the winner : original — it ’s about half the price of the new product and just as effective .			0

some beauty products are centuries old and are still being updated
@entity204 was first developed in the 1870s and is still going strong today
but do these older products stand the test of time against their new *rivals* ?
