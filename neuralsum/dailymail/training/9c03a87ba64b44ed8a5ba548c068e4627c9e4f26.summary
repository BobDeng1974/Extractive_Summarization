@entity0 insisted that she was a victim of racism and she experienced what ' people of black or brown color experience daily ' , in an interview with a @entity8 newspaper published today			1
@entity0 , one of the world 's richest women , revealed on @entity11 last week that she felt discriminated against when a sales assistant in a luxury @entity14 refused to show her a $ 38,000 handbag designed by @entity16 and named after @entity17			1
' i was asked if i am confronted with racism , ' she told @entity8 daily @entity19 in an interview in @entity21 on monday night but not published until today			1
casual ' racism ' : @entity0 , who said she was dressed nicely , told the newspaper that what she experienced was what ' people of black or brown color experience daily ' ' my answer - not in the same way as others because i am so well known			1
except on @entity30 , no - one dares confront me with the n - word			0
i feel discrimination in a different way			0
' my antenna receives an underlying " what is going on here ? " i called @entity37 an example , because it was happening			2
' asked if she was being ' particularly sensitive , ' she said : ' no ! i know of no black man who was never stopped by police because of his skin color , or persecuted , but it 's different for women			1
what i 've experienced in @entity8 happened only once before in my life			1
' so i did n't want to indict @entity8			1
it was a single incident			0
an incident that people of black or brown color experience daily			1
she even added that she was tempted to call her friends @entity16 or @entity17 as she stood in the store			1
' that damn bag ' : @entity0 said that if she had known the cost of the bag when she asked to see it - she probably would have thought it was too expensive ' snub ' : @entity0 said in the interview that shop assistants ' usually rejoice when she enters a store ' , owned by @entity62 , above			1
@entity0 added : ' people usually press their noses flat against the windows to see me shopping ' ' it was however uncommon for that to happen to me			1
believe me , usually sales people rejoice when i come to them in their business			2
it is very unusual that i 'm not really involved when in a boutique			0
outside , people usually press their noses flat against the windows to see me shopping			1
' @entity0 had claimed in the original @entity11 that the @entity77 - born sales assistant refused to show her the crocodile leather bag , the suggestion being , she implied , that as a black woman she could not afford it			1
the incident happened at the @entity83 in @entity84 , a street behind the ritzy @entity85 in @entity37 , one of the world 's wealthiest and most expensive cities			2
@entity0 was invited to be a guest in july at the wedding of soul singer @entity90 in @entity8 and wanted a handbag to compliment her outfit			1
she went on : ' i was the only person in the store			2
i had dressed myself up extra special because i know that things can get very snobby in these kinds of stores			2
' the employees first check out what clothes you 're wearing			0
therefore i chose a @entity102 outfit - and even washed my hair even			0
so nobody could mistake me for a homeless person who got lost in the store			1
' the woman did not want to get down the bag which i wanted to look at			2
the effort was too much for her			0
she said to me , that the bag was simply too expensive			2
and i said : " i want to see it anyway			0
" instead she tossed me cheaper bags			0
' i said : " okay , thank you very much ! but i really want to see the others			0
" she still kept showing me the cheaper ones			0
friends : @entity0 said she felt like calling @entity16 - who designed the bag - or @entity17 - who it was named after , as she stood there in the store touchy : @entity0 denied claims that she was being ' over-sensitive ' about race after the incident at the upmarket store in @entity37 , above ' to be honest , if i had known upfront what this damned bag cost , do you know what ? the woman was right : i would not have bought the thing - far too expensive ! too expensive ! $ 38,000 ! i would have fainted when i saw the price tag			1
' she continued : ' the saleslady said it was the @entity17 bag that was created by @entity16 for @entity17			1
the idea went through my head that i should call @entity17 or @entity16 - i know them both very well			1
instead i said to the saleslady : " okay , i understand			0
the bag is just for @entity17 , and only she is allowed to buy it , right ? ' the woman said " no , no " and tried to explain something			1
but i was no longer listening			0
i just said : " thank you very much , you 're probably right that i ca n't afford it			2
i did n't want to make a scene			0
that 's why it annoys me now too , that it has become this major international story			0
and that the names of @entity16 and @entity17 were pulled in too			1
the whole thing is really quite annoying			0
' she acknowledges the apologies of the owner @entity62 and the anonymous saleslady but added : ' but i do n't know whether the apology brings something			0
discrimination is there , anywhere around the world , every day			0
as i said , i did not want to bring the whole of @entity8 into disrepute			2
' perhaps she never wanted to reach for the bag because it was too high up			0
does anyone know ? anyway , i had a great time in @entity8			2
my friend @entity90 got married , i went for a walk every day			0
it 's a pity that such a big deal is now being made out of this other thing			0
' the publication of the frank interview will do nothing to quell the war of words currently raging between the tv talk show queen and @entity62			2
yesterday @entity62 said she wanted to speak personally to @entity0 and defended her employee to the hilt , adding : â€˜ i do n't know why she talked of racism			1
i am sorry , but perhaps she is being a little over-sensitive here			0
maybe she was somewhat offended because she was not immediately recognized in the store			0
' regrets : @entity0 says she is sorry that he vacation to @entity8 was overshadowed by what happened as she had a lovely time walking and at the wedding of @entity90 and @entity193 , above			1

@entity0 gave *extraordinary* interview to @entity8 newspaper @entity19 claiming she experienced what ' people of black or brown color experience daily '
@entity0 has accused a store assistant at a @entity37 store of ' racism ' for refusing to show her a $ 38,000 @entity16 @entity17 handbag
said she was dressed nicely and ' did n't look like a homeless person ' and usually people are ' pressing noses against glass to watch her shopping '
admits she would n't have bought the bag if she knew its price before she asked to see it
@entity0 regrets that it has become a ' national affair ' in @entity8
