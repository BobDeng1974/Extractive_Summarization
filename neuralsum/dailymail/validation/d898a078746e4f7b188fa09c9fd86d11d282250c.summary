former deputy leader of @entity1 admitted there are illegal , underage brides in the town 's @entity5 community @entity5 gipsy immigrants are illegally marrying underage girls as young as 12 before bringing them to the @entity9 to live			1
girls as young as 12 and 13 are regularly being married off in exchange for thousands of pounds in countries including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 before being brought to @entity9			1
the former deputy leader of @entity17 , where more than 1,400 schoolgirls were sexually exploited by @entity20 gangs , made the revelation at a meeting this week			1
it has prompted calls for an urgent investigation into how many child brides are living in @entity9 's estimated 250,000 - strong @entity5 community			1
the arranged marriages of girls under 16 is common in @entity5 communities , where families follow the @entity5 code @entity33 which encourages girls to marry soon after reaching puberty			1
the code dictates that the head of the large family group is always obeyed and in some cases large sums of money can be involved when matchmakers seek out a suitable young girl for marriage			2
during a meeting of the full council in @entity47 this week , independent councillor @entity44 repeatedly questioned former deputy leader @entity1 over the claims			1
@entity49 finally admitted there are illegal brides in the town 's large @entity53 immigrant community , adding it was ' unacceptable '			1
@entity56 said : ' on the @entity5 community you 're not answering my questions			1
i 've asked five times now and you 're still avoiding it			0
' i asked are there any people in the @entity5 community in @entity47 married to underage children - that 's under 16 - years - old			1
' we need a bit of honesty for the people of @entity47 or we will go nowhere			1
' @entity49 replied : ' it 's a simple answer - yes , children are being married underage and that is unacceptable			2
' we have to work with police to tackle that and we have to work with the commissioners to make sure there are actions in place to tackle these issues			0
@entity17 ( pictured ) heard there are underage illegal child brides in the town 's @entity5 community ' underage marriage is an issue in @entity47 and we have to tackle that			1
part of that is understanding how we tackle it			0
' we need to get it right - we ca n't write off those girls because they are in that community			2
' but she said she was unable to say how many children in the town might be married to men already			2
but @entity56 said : ' you say you ca n't get the information , but a passport has marital status on it			0
if you 're concerned about a child then you can get that information from the police - saying you ca n't answer is unacceptable			0
' if they 're here legally then they 're here on a passport and the police can find out			0
' speaking after the meeting he said : ' officially in @entity47 there are 6,500 @entity5 gypsies but unofficially it is more like 7,500			1
cllr @entity44 ( pictured ) said young @entity5 girls are being married off and brought to @entity47 ' i believe there are young @entity5 girls who come over here already married			1
they could n't possibly legally marry here			0
' but when i have asked for information i have been told that it is not possible to find out but i believe council officials should be looking into this			2
' we have already got the child sexual exploitation scandal in @entity47 and i do n't want us in five or ten years time to have the same situation with this			2
' just because a child is allowed to marry at the age of 12 or 13 in another country does n't mean we have to change our laws to accommodate that			0
we have one law which should be fairly implemented for everyone who lives here wherever they have come from			0
two damning reports into child sex abuse in @entity47 revealed that more than 1,400 young girls were groomed , trafficked and abused by gangs of mostly @entity140 men over a 16 - year period			1
@entity142 and the town 's @entity143 were accused of covering up the abuse			1
the government has since appointed commissioners to take over running of the scandal - hit council			2
a @entity142 spokesman said : ' @entity142 is committed to tackling issues of underage and forced marriage			0
' part of our strategy for tackling issues of forced marriage is that we consider the benefits of working in partnership locally and nationally			0
' because forced marriage is often a hidden and under - reported crime , we recognise within @entity162 that there is a need to develop creative and flexible ways to break down any barriers and to encourage full and active engagement with local agencies , communities and groups			0
' information regarding forced marriage issues can be received from various sources and involve sensitive and complex issues			0
therefore within @entity142 we have specially trained officers who deal with such matters , such as domestic violence officers , and child protection officers			0
' we would encourage any victim of forced marriage to come forward and report it to police , in the confidence that they will be listened to , that they will be taken seriously and that a thorough investigation will take place			0
' anyone with information about underage or forced marriage is asked to contact police on 101 or @entity189 anonymously on 0800 555 111 .			0
