saddened : @entity0 has said @entity1 would have ' furious ' about the release of @entity3 , the fourth book in the @entity6 series @entity1 's partner has hit out at plans to release a fourth installment in the @entity11 series more than a decade after the journalist 's death - dismissing it as nothing more than a money - making scheme			1
@entity0 has said @entity1 would have ' furious ' about the release of @entity3 , which will hit the shelves in august to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the hugely successful girl with a @entity11			1
@entity0 - the left wing journalist 's partner of more than three decades - has not only questioned the motivation of the publishing house , but been hugely critical of the author chosen to follow in her late partner 's footsteps			1
@entity28 , a journalist and author best known as footballer @entity31 's official biographer , is ' a completely idiotic choice ' in her view			1
' they say heroes are supposed to live forever			0
that 's a load of c * * * , this is about money , ' she said			2
' it 's about a publishing house that needs money , ( and ) a writer who does n't have anything to write so he copies someone else			2
' @entity1 had , in fact , begun work on a fourth book centering on protagonists @entity51 , a feisty rebel hacker - turned - detective , and @entity53 , an investigative reporter , before his untimely death in 2004			1
aged just 50 , he suffered a heart attack as he walked the seven storeys to his office , where he worked as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine expo			0
the books were published posthumously , so @entity1 never saw how successful the books were to become : so far , they have sold more than 75million copies in more than 30 languages , according to publisher @entity65			2
however , @entity0 , 61 , has dismissed any idea he had an overarching plan for the novels - a theory which has been used to justify the publication of this latest 500 page tome			1
she also revealed @entity28 had not seen the fourth manuscript , and ' started over from zero '			2
' everyone thinks there was some grand scheme but no , he had no plan for the first three books and when he started writing the fourth one , it was spontaneous			2
he still did n't have a plan , ' she said			0
if it were up to her , none of this would have happened			0
' i would n't have continued @entity1 's work			1
it was his language , his unique narrative			0
' furious ? : @entity1 - who died in 2004 , before his trilogy became successful - had started work on the next book , but @entity28 , who has picked up the baton , has started from scratch with his version @entity0 says she views @entity95 is ' a completely idiotic choice ' to continue @entity1 's work , with even the ' very literary ' title sitting badly with her			1
she said : ' [ @entity100 ] comes from a completely different background			0
everything has always been easy for him			0
he 's never been an activist			0
' @entity0 , who met @entity1 as a teenager , added : ' let him dig his own grave			1
' for @entity0 , the publication is a bitter blow - the outcome of a bitter battle against her partner 's family to manage his work			1
success : the books , which have sold millions around the world , have been made into blockbuster films following his death , @entity0 wanted to manage his authorship to avoid its commercialisation , but she says she never reached an agreement with @entity1 's brother and father and they now manage his estate			1
she says now ' there is nothing left to protect '			0
but @entity0 , who only recently moved out of the home they shared as she tries to rebuild her life , believes the wrong things have happened - especially when it comes to the new book			1
' the worst thing is how saddened @entity1 would have been			2
he never let anyone work on his literary texts			0
' he would have been furious			0
who knows , maybe he 'll send a lightning bolt at the book launch			0
