miss @entity2 told the @entity28 : ‘ it is so difficult , but if i had to come down one side or another i ’d say yes , that particular law should go through			2
i know all the problems of course			2
it does n’t seem to have had the problems overseas that the worriers keep raising			2
‘ personally , yes , my @entity37 , of course			2
it is hard to imagine anyone with a humane bone in their body would n’t want to stop terrible suffering			1
’ she added : ‘ i think the general public are changing their mind			1
a lot of these high profile cases have confronted people with what suffering is			2
i would absolutely take myself off to @entity9 if i thought i was going to be in unbearable pain , definitely			0
’ it is the first time @entity50 , who starred opposite sir @entity51 in the hit 1966 film @entity54 and famously dated sir @entity55 , has publicly stated her views on assisted suicide			1

the actress , who has three children with her husband , illustrator @entity64 , 78 , used to be a member of the @entity66 , which also supports euthanasia			1
but she says she left the organisation long ago , adding : ‘ i think a rationalist is a better description of me			0

’ miss @entity2 admitted she was less sure about linking her name to @entity74 at first , because of its reputation for cheap goods , but said she changed her mind			1
she said : ‘ when they first approached me , my reaction was “ oh , i ’m not sure about this at all			0
” i thought it would be cheap stuff which i did n’t like and i did n’t think they could ever make a range which i would genuinely buy and use			0
‘ but i was surprised by how good the products are			0
i use them in my own kitchen , especially the non-stick tins			0
i know that i ’m deemed to be upmarket because of my accent and the roles i ’ve played , which makes my connection to @entity74 surprising and also very clever			0
