the problem with this is that mixing the two drugs can trigger what 's known as ' serotonin syndrome '			1
this is a potentially serious drug interaction that occurs when too much serotonin builds up in the body , say scientists from the @entity45 in @entity46			1
although serotonin is often referred to as the ' happy hormone ' , too much of it can cause confusion , disorientation , hallucinations , tremors			2

but its users are no longer only elderly gentleman wanting to pharmaceutically enhance their performance between the sheets			2
problems : psychosexual counsellors are reporting treating more young men who have become dependent on @entity2 for improve their sexual performance used correctly , it 's a welcome and safe form of pharmaceutical help but it 's the worrying trend of young men abusing the drug , and in some cases combining it with other lethal drugs and narcotics , that has health officials concerned about the long term mental health consequences as well as the more immediate physical dangers			1
instead , @entity2 is now considered a ' party drug ' among young men and is often mixed with a ' cocktail ' of other drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy which health professionals warn could have long term or even immediately fatal consequences			1
while each combination poses a different health risk , researchers from @entity96 in @entity97 are specifically concerned about the growing trend of combining @entity2 with ' poppers ' or amyl nitrate			1
both drugs serve to dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow - but combining them results in a sudden drop in blood pressure which can cause a stroke or heart attack			2
talking about this deadly combination dr. @entity112 , sexologist an associate fellow of @entity114 says : ' @entity2 and nitrates are never to be used together , ' adding , ' people have died from doing that '			1
@entity2 is now considered a ' party drug ' among young men and is often mixed with a ' cocktail ' of other drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy - with potentially fatal consequences but as well as the physical health risks , experts are also keen to warn the public of the mental effects too			1

the pharmacy 's online doctor saw demand peak at 9.31pm on wednesday as @entity140 took advantage of home delivery of their medication before @entity25			0
@entity144 , business development manager at @entity134 , said : ‘ it seems as though this @entity25 weekend is likely to be our busiest period in the history of the @entity150 service			0
‘ we anticipate dispensing around one erectile dysfunction aid every three minutes during our busiest delivery and collection times			0
‘ we do n’t want to just raise awareness of the service , we also want to encourage more men to get the treatment they might have been too embarrassed to ask for before			2
' this is a problem that matters not just on @entity25 , but also throughout the other 364 days of the year			0
’ he said : ' i think this is just a small sample of the problem			0
these men do n’t have any physical problems that would cause erectile difficulties			2
' instead they feel they need it because they are putting too many expectations on themselves			0
' @entity127 , like many experts , believes some of his male patients are negatively influenced by their exposure to internet pornography			2
theorising that like men who are exposed to pornography early in life who then acquire a dependence on pornographic imagery for sexual stimulation , young @entity2 users may also develop a kind of dependence on this little blue pill			1
a theory supported by scientists at the @entity184			0
they took 1,207 sexually active males and examined the erectile function characteristics and ' sexual confidence ' among recreational users of @entity2 , prescribed users of @entity2 and nonusers of @entity2			1
after completing the survey they discovered users of @entity2 ' reported lower erectile confidence and lower overall satisfaction compared with nonusers			1
' concluding their results support the ' possibility that recreational erectile dysfunction medication use among healthy young men may lead to psychogenic erectile dysfunction			0
