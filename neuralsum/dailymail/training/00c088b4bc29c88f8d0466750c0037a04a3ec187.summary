by @entity1 reporter published : 10:25 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 10:47 est , 11 june 2013 red meat allergies caused by a single , tiny species of tick are becoming increasingly common in a well - known enclave of some of the wealthiest people in @entity8			1
tucked away at the tip of @entity10 , @entity11 , the @entity12 have long been a refuge for the rich from the sweltering @entity11 summer			2
and it may also increasingly be a haven for the @entity17 tick , a small critter that causes a big problem			1
that is , if you ’re a meat eater			2
@entity22 ... odd reaction : the increasingly common lone star tick , named for the spot on the female 's back , appears to inject a substance when it bites that causes victims to become allergic to red meat , sometimes violently ‘ it 's a huge problem out here , ’ says @entity33 , an allergist in @entity34 , @entity32 told @entity37			1
‘ i 've been trying to get the word out			0
’ there may be a lot fewer filet minons hitting the grill this summer			0
symptoms of the strange illness range from mild , like abdominal cramps , to severe , like anaphylaxis and even death			0
hives , difficulty breathing , and vomiting are also possible			0
and they all stem from eating red meat			1
though researchers say the symptoms , unlike those from typical food allergies , may take hours to take hold			0
burger time ? residents of the @entity12 , @entity11 's summer playground for the rich , are increasingly being bitten by ticks that cause severe reactions to red meat in some people little bugger : the head of a lone star tick			1
researchers think the bug 's bite can inject a sugar called alpha - gal that causes future encounters with the substance , also found in red meat , to trigger an allergic response six years ago , @entity76 of @entity77 , @entity11 says he began waking up unable to breath in the middle of the night , covered in hives			1
it happened every few months for years and doctors could only say it was some sort of allergy and administer antihistamines			1
but then @entity76 , 49 , noticed the symptoms only occurred when he ate meat			2
first it was lamb , then steak , then burgers			0
‘ i swore off red meat completely , and the reactions stopped , ’ he said			1
researchers believe the tick passes on a kind of carbohydrate called alpha - gal that is present in meat			1
it is believed that , after a tick encounter , some people ’s immune systems begin to treat alpha - gal as an allergen			2
hence , the often serious reactions			0
and the problem may be becoming more widespread			2
the lone star tick — which is not named for the state of @entity111 , but for the single white spot on the backs of females — was once confined to the ‘ tick belt ’ of the @entity116 @entity8 , but has increasingly been found further into @entity118 and @entity119 states			1
along with the tick , the cases seem to be spreading			0
hence , the sudden increase of cases in the @entity12			0
worse and worse : and the problem is spreading			0
once confined to the @entity116 @entity8 ' tick belt , ' the lone star tick is now found further west and north , such as in the wealthy @entity10 enclave @entity33 said she currently knows of around 70 cases and sees more every week			1
unfortunately , there continues to be scepticism regarding the what exactly causes the reactions			0
most allergic reactions are immediate , which means people are n’t always able to identify the cause of their symptoms , much less trace them back to a tick bite that could have occurred been months prior			2
confusion : reactions and triggers vary , making diagnosis difficult			0
unlike other food allergies , the meat reaction occurs hours after consumption			0
and the allergy itself may not begin until long after contact with the tiny tick the good news : thankfully , contacts with the vegetarianism - inducing tick can be avoided and scientists think the allergy may fade after years of avoiding subsequent bites adding to the confusion is the range of triggers for the allergy			1
some people react more seriously to some meats than others and some people ’s reactions can even be triggered by something as simple as the gelatin in gelcap vitamins or marshmallows			1
and even with people like @entity33 sounding the alarm , she says ‘ there are still a lot of people who do n't believe it			2
’ despite the questions and lingering confusion , there is some good news			0
the allergy , researchers are finding , seems to fade after years have passed since the initial trigger so long as recurring tick bites are avoided and no deaths have thus far been reported .			1

the @entity17 tick contains a substance that makes people react violently to red meat
doctors do n't know how long the allergy could last , but its increasingly common and becoming more widespread in the @entity8
