watching @entity0 will have most parents believe that a child should never be left alone , but one mother is challenging this idea			2
@entity5 , a mother - of - three living in @entity6 , @entity7 , told @entity8 that she feels it 's important for parents to draw the line between protecting their children and ' keep [ ing ] them from developing confidence and growing into their own capable person			1
' so , on occasion , she leaves her seven - year - old son in their apartment for short periods of time of 45 minutes or less , and she says the independence and confidence it gives him is well worth it			1
parenting : blogger and mother - of - three @entity5 ( pictured with her son ) has sparked a heated debate after revealing that she sometimes leaves her seven - year - old son home alone for up to 45 minutes at a time ' it 's essential for kids to learn and be confident that they have the ability to take care of themselves and to fight their own battles - and to know that they have the support and confidence of their parents as well , ' she explained			1
in ms @entity5 's post on her blog the @entity42 , she explains that her son is a homebody who is responsible , follows the rules and is happy to be on his own			1
referring to him as @entity47 because of his ' old soul ' , she says when he asked to be left at home while she went to the laundromat around the corner from their apartment building , she acquiesced - after first teaching him what to do in case of emergency , of course			2
' it 's essential for kids to learn and be confident that they have the ability to take care of themselves ' on another instance , she took her two younger children for a run around @entity67 , and again she let her son stay behind			2
' i was gone for about 45 minutes for the longer of the excursions , [ and ] by the end of that time , i was a little bit anxious to get home , ' she told @entity8			1
' he was starting to wonder when we were getting back as well , so it seems we both felt that 45 minutes was about our limit - for now			1
' comfortable alone : the @entity6 - based mom explains that her son is a homebody who is responsible and follows the rules , and he often asks to be left at home while she runs errands she added that as he does it more frequently , he will likely get accustomed and 45 minutes wo n't seem like such a long time anymore			1
but until then , she does n't want the experience to be uncomfortable for him			0
' not that he would n't be able to handle himself in terms of following the rules or taking care of himself , ' she clarifies			0
' but more that he would start to get anxious and worried , which i do n't think is terribly important for him to experience at this point in his life or in this context			0
' ms @entity5 has written that she is averse to the idea of ' helicopter parenting ' - mothers and fathers who stifle their kids by being too involved in their lives - and instead encourages hers to learn and do things on their own			1
@entity104 : ' it 's essential for kids to learn and be confident that they have the ability to take care of themselves and to fight their own battles , ' she says ' they need to have the ability to make their own decisions in life and to function without supervision , ' she says			2
' getting in the way of that maturing process can , i believe , cripple children as they grow up and do n't have the confidence or the knowledge of how to handle problems as they arise			0
' ' getting in the way of that maturing process can , i believe , cripple children as they grow up ' not only is it perfectly safe to leave your child alone , it 's also perfectly legal - at least in the state of @entity7			0
according to the @entity133 website , there is no specific age limit when it comes to children being at home alone			0
' some children are responsible , intelligent , and independent enough to be left alone at 12 or 13 years of age , ' it reads			0
baby steps : she says as he gets older , he will likely get accustomed to being alone and 45 minutes wo n't seem like such a long time			1
but until then , she does n't want the experience to be uncomfortable for him ' parents and guardians need to make intelligent , reasoned decisions regarding these matters			0
' for ms @entity5 , she 's confident that she has made the right decision for her son - although her feelings on the topic may be significantly different when her daughter , now two , is his age			2
' i like to think that it would depend on the child , regardless of their gender , but i also know that little girls appear more vulnerable , ' she admitted			0
' i think when she gets to be that old i will first need to evaluate her temperament and decide if she has the maturity and awareness to handle that kind of responsibility			0
