by @entity0 @entity1 smiled and gave a thumbs - up as she began her symbolic journey at @entity4			1
but , after just one timed lap , the first woman to participate in a grand prix weekend for 22 years ground to a halt			1
an engine problem forced her @entity10 out of the first practice session — an anti-climax after all the hoopla surrounding the merits of her involvement			2
all over : @entity1 was forced to retire from the first practice session after an engine failure in her @entity10 out : @entity10 ' @entity1 was massively disappointed with the way she retired in the opening practice history : the 31 - year - old became the first female driver to step into an @entity24 cockpit during a grand prix weekend @entity1 , 31 , was not scheduled to drive in the second session so that was the end of her @entity29 @entity28			1
she is , however , due to drive in practice at @entity31 , @entity32 in a fortnight			2
‘ it is a massive disappointment , ’ she said			0
‘ on the plus side , we had such a good build - up to this weekend			0
obviously , i had put so much hard work in to get ready for today and i knew exactly what i had to do on every lap. sad end : marshals remove the car of @entity45 driver @entity1 after an oil - pressure problem go again : @entity1 will be handed another chance at the wheel of the @entity10 in practice for the @entity32 gp dramatic : @entity10 teammate @entity51 crashed out in a rather more spectacular way during practice getting carried away : @entity51 's car is removed from the track but @entity10 managed to repair it quickly ‘ it felt good — even the out lap — but that is racing			1
i have known from over the years that there can be massive ups and massive downs			0
‘ it is very , very disappointing , but i have still got @entity31 and i have to go out and show what i can do because i did not get the chance to do that today			0
’ her misfortune was less dramatic than that of @entity10 ’ other driver , @entity51			1
he lost control at @entity73 and crashed at 130mph , leaving his machine a mangled mess			0
both cars were repaired in time for the second session .			0
