@entity0 claims he would have an easy night 's work against @entity2 as he and @entity3 had to be pulled apart during a heated weigh - in			1
fury is the mandatory challenger world heavyweight champion @entity2 but must avoid a slip - up against @entity3 at the @entity6 in @entity7 on saturday night			1
and the 26 - year - old would rather face the @entity9 than recently - crowned champion @entity10			2
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 had to be pulled apart as they clashed at the weigh - in tempers flared as the two heavyweights and their entourages clashed at the weigh - in ' to be honest i 'm the man in the division to beat , ' @entity0 said			1
' everyone wants to fight me because they know i generate interest			0
people are interested in me probably for the wrong reasons , or the right reasons , but they 're still interested - that 's why people want to fight			2
' they want to come to the @entity27 to fight me			0
[ @entity10 's ] the world champion but he 's the guy who first said he wants to fight @entity0 after winning the title			1
so i must be doing something right , i must be on the right track			0
' i would like to fight @entity2 [ @entity32 ] first because no 1 he 's my mandatory , no 2 he 's the best in the division and no 3 because he is an easy fight			1
then i 'll fight @entity10			0
i wo n't be taking any interim fights i 'll unify straight away			0
' the @entity0 camp has been given a boost with the recent release from prison of @entity0 's dad @entity42 after five - years away			1
@entity0 poses during the weigh - in ahead of his heavyweight showdown with @entity3 the imposing heavyweight believes that the return of his father will be a major plus for him going forward			1
' it 's definitely [ a boost ] to have my dad back , he 's been away for a long time , so having him back in the gym and seeing his face every day is very good â€“ it 's happy days at @entity54 , ' he said			2
' he gets to the gym at seven in the morning and does n't leave till 10 at night ; he 's definitely putting his misspent time back into practice in the gym			0
it is nice having him around and seeing his face back in the gym and the smile on it when you 're doing good things in boxing			0
' anybody would be proud of what their sons achievements are - whatever they do			0
you do n't have to be so successful but as long as you 've got somebody who tries their best in something that they 're doing then i think that any father should be proud of their son			0
' you do n't have to be a world champion , you do n't have to be a millionaire but i believe every father should be proud of his own son , ' @entity80 also weighed in ahead of his fight with @entity82 on saturday despite talk of a world title fight in the summer , former @entity27 and @entity83 champion @entity0 is well aware that he can not overlook 27 - year - old @entity3 , who has 17 wins from his 20 fights			1
' at this level in boxing you 're fighting top five opponents and in @entity3 the @entity92 ranked @entity94 heavyweight in the world so nobody is going to be easy , they 're all hard fights , ' he added			1
' you can say i 'm in touching distance of a world title but in hindsight i may as well be five million miles away because i 'm not fighting @entity2 , i 'm not in the ring with him and that fight 's not happening in my mind			1
' until i 'm in the ring in the opposite corner it 's not on so it 's just another fight for me , another day in the office			2
i 'm going to go in there and box , move around and win and get out of there			0
' @entity80 and @entity82 show off their physiques during the weigh - in at the 02 fury vs @entity3 is live and exclusive on @entity116 on saturday			2
