a judge is expected to settle the bitter dispute between dr @entity3 's children over who is entitled to his @entity5 and his @entity6			1
the last time the reverend 's holy book was seen in public was to swear in president @entity10 in 2013			1
since , it has remained in a safe with the slain civil rights icon 's 1964 award , as his sister fights to stop her brothers from selling them			1
decision : a judge will decide whether @entity3 's sons can sell his @entity5 and @entity6 last used : president @entity10 was the last person to touch the @entity5 during his second inauguration in 2013 civil rights hero : the sale has sparked controversy within the family and the slain hero 's friends on tuesday , @entity29 superior court judge @entity28 will either pass a deciding verdict , or let it go to trial			1
@entity33 and @entity34 , who control @entity35 , have agreed to sell the lucrative heirlooms to a private buyer			1
but their sister @entity38 refused to hand over the items			1
since she finally agreed to give the prize and @entity5 to a court in march 2014 , it is believed the estate will likely win the case			1
this is at least the fifth lawsuit between the siblings in the past decade			0
but according to @entity38 , but this one crosses the line			2
speaking in february last year from the pulpit of historic @entity51 in @entity52 , where her father and grandfather preached , she said her father cherished these two items , which speak to the very core of who he was			2
dispute : @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) say the estate needs desperate funding opposed : dr @entity63 , who followed her father into preaching , said you can not sell his @entity5 the rev. @entity67 , who served as assistant pastor at @entity51 from 1978 to 1984 and sides with @entity38 but describes himself as a friend of the whole family , told @entity72 : ' you do n't sell @entity74 and you do n't get but one @entity6			1
there are some items that you just do n't put a price on			0
' the estate 's lawyers have not responded to requests for comment from the @entity33 brothers			2
at a hearing last year , a lawyer who represented the estate at the time said they want to sell the two items because the estate needs the money			0
paying lawyers to enforce the rights to @entity33 's words and image is expensive , attorney @entity94 reminded the judge , drawing chuckles			1
the estate is a private entity , so its finances are n't public , and court records do n't elaborate on the estate 's need for cash			2
whether to sell the @entity5 and the medal is not up to the judge , or even part of the lawsuit , which is purely an ownership dispute			1
lawyers for @entity38 have argued , among other things , that @entity33 gave the @entity111 medal to his wife as a gift , meaning that it is part of @entity116 's estate			1
@entity38 is the administrator of her mother 's estate			2
family dispute : the battle is the fifth to rip between the @entity33 family since dr @entity3 died @entity33 's heirs have previously parted with parts of his legacy			2
they sold a collection of more than 10,000 of his personal papers and books in 2006 for $ 32 million , a collection now housed at @entity130 , @entity33 's alma mater			2
two separate appraisers , @entity132 and @entity133 , told the @entity72 they would expect the medal to sell for about $ 5 million to $ 10 million , and possibly more , based on what other @entity111 medals have gone for and @entity33 's place in history			1
@entity138 said she would expect the @entity5 to sell for at least $ 200,000 and possibly more than $ 400,000			2
@entity133 said it would probably go for about $ 1 million			0
if they are sold through a private sale , which can bring substantially higher sums from buyers who want to secure items before they get to auction , the medal alone could fetch $ 15 million to $ 20 million , @entity133 said			1
both items have enormous societal value and should be on public display , said @entity150 , director of education and interpretation at the @entity152 in @entity153			0
the @entity5 is important because of who @entity33 was , and the @entity6 because of what it signified — that the fight for civil rights was being recognized on a world stage , she said			1
while museums and books can talk about the medal , being able to see it renders it tangible , ' more than a photograph , more than us just talking or writing about it , ' @entity150 said			0
' we like to own things			0
we like to touch things			0
we like to see them with our eyes			0
it satisfies that need in us to see the physical manifestation of the award			0
' even in the hands of @entity38 , though , neither item has regularly been available to the public			0
both ' are in the same places they have been for years			0
the @entity6 medal is located in a safe deposit box in possession of the @entity33 family , and the @entity5 is in a safe and secure location ' known to @entity38 and her brothers , her lawyers wrote in response to the lawsuit			1
a replica of the medal has been on display at the @entity51 for about 17 years , but it 's unclear when the medal itself was last shown , @entity189 spokesman @entity188 said			0
@entity3 was assassinated in @entity153 in 1968			0
among his children , @entity196 got his father 's name , while @entity200 got his looks			1
other battles : the brothers have also tried to stop their sister using dr @entity33 's image and memorabilia @entity38 followed her father into the ministry and shares his gift for public speaking			1
and the firstborn , @entity212 , was known as a peacekeeper			0
even before she died in 2007 , though , the siblings had taken their quarrels public and gone through periods where they did n't speak to each other			0
in december 2005 , @entity38 and @entity196 successfully fought a push by @entity212 and @entity200 , who along with other trustees of the @entity189 wanted to sell it to the @entity221			2
in 2008 , two years after the death of their mother and a year after @entity212 died , a long - simmering dispute between the surviving siblings boiled over , with three lawsuits filed between them in as many months			0
in august 2013 — on the 50th anniversary of @entity33 's ' @entity231 ' speech — the estate asked a judge to stop the @entity51 , where @entity38 is the ceo , from using his image , likeness and memorabilia , arguing that the center was n't caring for @entity33 artifacts properly			1
that case is pending .			0

@entity33 and @entity34 plan to sell their father 's @entity5 and 1964 @entity6 to a private buyer
their sister @entity38 refused to hand over the items and opposes the sale
last march , she handed them to a court and they remained in a safe
a judge will pass verdict or send the case to trial on tuesday
the @entity5 was last seen at @entity10 's inauguration on *january* 20 , 2013
