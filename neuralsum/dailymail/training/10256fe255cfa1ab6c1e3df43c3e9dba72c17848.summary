let 's just sweep it under the rug			0
send him somewhere else and be done with it			0

' winding up : the unidentified superior who wielded the mallet is shown in the video taking three measured practice swings at @entity9 's gut a vicious swing : @entity9 's unidentified superior then whacks the 22 - year - old seemingly as hard as he can in the abdomen an empty handshake : the mallet 's wielder then congratulates @entity9 with a handshake as the grimacing sergeant obviously fights through the resulting pain but mr @entity9 sneered that the punishment was a ' slap on the wrist ' and said it was not good enough			1

mr. @entity9 , for his part , served from 1982 to 1990			0
the father told the @entity86 his son informed him during his junior year at @entity39 @entity124 that he wanted to join the @entity47 ' so he could serve under the flag and fight for the freedom of the @entity127			0

' @entity133 , chair of the @entity134 , has released a statement asking the @entity47 to review the case			0
in obvious pain : after shaking hands with his superior , @entity27 doubles over in obvious pain from the blow the aftermath : moments after he is slugged with the mallet , @entity9 doubles over in pain , supporting himself by laying both hands on a nearby table laid out : @entity9 then falls to the concrete floor , first hitting his head on a folding chair and then on the hard surface			2
