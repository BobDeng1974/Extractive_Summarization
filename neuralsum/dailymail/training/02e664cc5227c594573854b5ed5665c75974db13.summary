perfect for tourists who have seen enough beaches or city landscapes , this floating hotel offers a room with a different kind of view : ten feet beneath the surface of a @entity9 lake			1
the @entity10 offers guests a night to remember , with windows in every wall of the bedroom looking out into the water , teeming with fish			1
the ‘ floatel ’ is the brainchild of artist @entity21 , known for his unique hotel experiences including one in a tree in a city centre park , and ' ooops ' , the sunken villa which opened this summer not far from @entity10 by @entity18 , @entity19			1
idyllic : the floating hotel is located in the middle of a @entity9 lake east of @entity29 above surface : on top of the sundeck is a hut which is designed to resemble a traditional @entity9 cottage and guests step inside to climb down to their bedroom @entity10 has an above - surface kitchen inside a little hut made to look like a traditional @entity9 cottage			1
at bedtime guests climb down the hatch to their sleeping quarters which has an all - round view of life under the surface			0
mr @entity21 , who opened @entity10 in 2000 , said the idea came to him out of the blue and he was curious to see if it could work			1
he said : ‘ i do n't think there is an experience quite like sleeping underwater and many people have come to find out if they like it			0
life in a goldfish bowl : guests can look out into the lake from the bedroom @entity59 : despite the tough steel and glass exterior , the bedroom room has a homely feel with a hand - knitted @entity9 rug on the wooden floor ‘ it 's like a reverse aquarium - the fish like looking in at the guests and are fascinated by them			2
' it 's as if you 're sat on your own island when you 're on board - it 's just an amazing experience			0
' after being taken out to the floating hut by @entity10 staff , visitors can relax on the deck or use the hotel ’s inflatable dinghy to explore one of the uninhabited islands in @entity18 before a night underwater			2
the artist admitted that he had his doubts about the project when it first opened			0
' i was quite worried as it was an unproven concept , but now i love it ! ' because there is a window on every side , you feel totally submerged in the lake			2
' explore : in case the little hut gets too claustrophobic , guests can get in the inflatable dingy and take a trip around the lake small , but perfectly formed : cross section shows the floating platform and living quarters above the water line , with a ladder going down into the bedroom , with two single beds the @entity10 is located in southern @entity9 , just east of the capital @entity29 @entity21 said : ‘ a lot of people who have visited have said they slept extremely well because of the rocking motion on board			1
‘ people with busy lives and high - pressured jobs tend to visit , i think for the natural peace there is in the very relaxing surroundings			0
‘ you can hear the lapping of the water outside of the windows as well which i think is a very therapeutic sound			2
‘ i always want to be by water - it 's so soothing , romantic and calm - all at the same time			0
’ @entity126 : a nearby town brightens up the already light @entity9 summer night as the guests at @entity10 nip off to sleep with the fishes			0

windows on every wall look out into the lake , which is teeming with fish
