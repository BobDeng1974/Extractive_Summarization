@entity0 died at the age of 75 following a lengthy battle with cancer			1
today friends said the former home secretary 's final days had been ' dogged by allegations ' explosive claims that @entity0 conspired to cover up an @entity10 child sex ring are ‘ wholly unjustified ’ , a senior peer said yesterday			1
only days after he died from cancer , the @entity13 former home secretary was also the subject of wild allegations of ‘ multiple child rape ’			1
the second , toxic , claim was made in a newspaper yesterday by @entity20 mp @entity19 , who even compared the @entity13 grandee to @entity22 as he accused him of abusing three boys			1
@entity0 , who died last wednesday aged 75 after a long battle with cancer , remains under investigation by @entity27			1
he was questioned under caution last summer after a @entity20 activist came forward and accused him of raping her in 1967			0
the grandee has long been accused of failing to act on an abuse dossier passed to him by @entity13 mp @entity33 in 1983			1
yesterday @entity36 peer @entity34 said the claims were ‘ based on no evidence ’ , adding that @entity0 was ‘ an important political figure ’ whose final months were ‘ very sad ’			1
@entity34 , a former counter-terrorism watchdog , highlighted how mr @entity33 repeatedly praised @entity0 over his response to the ‘ dossier ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity33 praised him explicitly both in the @entity43 and in correspondence			2
‘ @entity0 has been the subject of a smear campaign in the media which is wholly unjustified and based on no evidence			1
‘ we know now there ’s a further very important point			0
we know now because it ’s been revealed publicly that he was interviewed by the police about an alleged offence not long before he died			2
no action was taken on it , he was never arrested let alone charged			0
’ but there are mounting allegations that @entity0 was himself embroiled in a sick world of child abuse			2
mr @entity19 said one alleged victim told him @entity0 raped him and described him as ‘ as close to evil as a human being could get ’			1
mr @entity19 suggested that , as with @entity22 , the @entity65 and tv presenter who was a prolific paedophile , the former minister may have been protected by a reluctance to examine the affairs of the powerful			0
@entity0 - pictured as @entity69 - with @entity70 in 1986 writing in the @entity71 , he called on the police to investigate the claims and described those victims and witnesses he has spoken to as ‘ sincere ’			1
and he attacked those who have stood by @entity0 and said they do not believe the victims ’ stories			0
mr @entity19 said : ‘ their comments were a cold dismissal of those who believe it ’s a travesty that @entity0 will never be asked the truth ; to answer questions about his conduct under oath at a public inquiry			1
‘ it is possible to spend a lot of time with a person and yet know nothing of their true nature			0
’ speaking about the reaction to his death , he added : ‘ all the glowing tributes reminded me of the media coverage immediately after @entity22 ’s death … ‘ @entity22 was protected by a media culture that worshipped at the altar of celebrity			0
was @entity0 protected by a misplaced sense of deference to the powerful ? ’ one key witness , known only as ‘ @entity108 ’ , claims @entity0 raped and abused him more than a dozen times at an apartment in @entity111 near @entity112 in the 1980s			1
mr @entity19 claims two others have made similar allegations of being raped by him			2
in his strident statement , mr @entity19 also said : ‘ @entity0 stands accused of multiple child rape			2
many others know of these allegations and chose to remain silent			0
’ last week @entity27 said its investigation in to the 1967 rape remains ‘ under review ’			1
but it is widely believed that @entity0 is also under scrutiny in the separate investigation , known as @entity125 , into historical sex abuse			2
this work is far from complete , but senior officers are understood to be considering how best to reveal their findings if prosecutions can not be brought			0
@entity131 , @entity20 mp for @entity132 , said : ‘ i think the @entity133 should share what information they do have on @entity0 so that it can help clear his name or help encourage other alleged victims to come forward			1
’ senior politicians have paid tribute to @entity0			0
@entity139 described him as a ‘ dedicated public servant ’			0
@entity0 abused teenage boys during sex parties which are at the heart of claims of an @entity10 paedophile ring , it was claimed yesterday			2
the @entity13 peer was accused of attending the orgies at the now notorious @entity111 luxury apartment complex in @entity112			2
a key witness ‘ @entity108 ’ , who has been described by police as ‘ credible ’ , told investigative website @entity153 he was raped ‘ more than a dozen times ’			1
he said @entity0 ‘ would treat me like i was not even human ’			0
and he added that the peer was ‘ nasty , cruel , sadistic and hateful ’			0
@entity111 : the scene of the orgies involving @entity0 , according to claims asked how he had identified him , @entity108 said : ‘ well , he told me			1
he told me that it was @entity0			0
and it was only later in my adult life that i knew who it was			0
’ he alleged that @entity0 attacked him from the age of 11			2
he said he witnessed other boys , all aged under 14 , being abused as well			0
shocking claims : @entity169 @entity108 has been interviewed at length by @entity27 detectives investigating allegations of sex abuse by the rich and powerful			1
last month they sensationally revealed that they found his claims of abuse , rape and even the murder of three boys to be ‘ credible and true ’			0
@entity0 has now been accused of being present at three venues where the alleged abuse of underage boys took place			1
in a separate development yesterday , a former police officer claimed he was photographed entering a second sex den. the @entity13 former cabinet minister , who was also a former @entity189 vice-president , was said to have been caught on camera during a surveillance operation focusing on rent boys around @entity193 in @entity194			1
police suspected young men were being trafficked around the capital and preyed upon in rented flats and garages by groups of men			0
and a schoolboy has claimed he was repeatedly molested at the @entity203 in @entity204 , @entity205 , by a man called ‘ @entity0 ’			0
the youngster made the comments in a police interview in 1982 but they were left out of his formal statement , despite being witnessed by officers and a social worker			0
the mystery omission , suspected to refer to @entity0 , came to light when the @entity133 began an investigation in 2013 into activities at the guest house , where a vip paedophile ring is said to have operated .			2

alleged victim ' @entity108 ' claims *ex-home* secretary raped him a dozen times
claims only made public after @entity0 's death from cancer last week
@entity27 *confirms* @entity227 remains *ongoing* police inquiry
friends of former minister say he was victim of ' unwarranted *innuendo* '
@entity0 had been accused of overlooking dossier of vip abuse claims
but new evidence shows @entity13 mp @entity33 thanked him for help
