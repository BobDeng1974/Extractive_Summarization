change : former defense secretary @entity0 , pictured friday addressing the @entity2 's annual meeting , says he would have allowed openly gay scoutmasters in the youth organization @entity0 , the new president of the @entity2 , said friday that he would have moved last year to allow openly gay adults in the organization but said he opposes any further attempts to address the policy now			1
@entity0 took over an organization this week that serves about 2.5million youth but faces continued membership declines and fights over its inclusion of openly gay boys , but not adults			1
gates , the former secretary of defense who oversaw the end of the military 's ' @entity17 ' policy , addressed those issues friday , a day after @entity25 's national leadership elected him president			1
' i was prepared to go further than the decision that was made , ' @entity0 told @entity29 in an interview in advance of a speech before the group 's national leaders at its annual meeting in @entity36 , @entity37			2
' i would have supported having gay scoutmasters , but at the same time , i fully accept the decision that was democratically arrived at by 1,500 volunteers from across the entire country			0
' the @entity2 's @entity2 voted at last year 's annual meeting to accept openly gay youth , after a monthslong process with protests on both sides			2
gates planned to tell @entity25 's leaders friday that a continued fight over the issue threatens @entity2 's future			0
' given the strong feelings — the passion — involved on both sides of this matter , i believe strongly that to re-open the membership issue or try to take last year 's decision to the next step would irreparably fracture and perhaps even provoke a formal , permanent split in this movement — with the high likelihood neither side would subsequently survive on its own , ' @entity0 said in prepared remarks			1
gates , 70 , who also served as director of the @entity65 , is a visible advocate for scouting as it faces a storm of bad publicity			2
gates , who took over an organization this week that serves about 2.5million youth , said he opposes any further attempts to address the policy pertaining to gay adults in @entity2 words of caution : @entity0 has warned that re-opening the membership issue could cause an irreparable schism within the movement the @entity2 reached out to @entity0 as he was retiring from the @entity80 and asked him to join their leadership , said @entity82 , the departing @entity2 president			1
@entity84 ceo @entity83 , who was expected to become president this year , agreed to wait another two years to allow @entity0 to serve now , @entity82 said			0
' we need @entity87 to know what the @entity2 can do for the youth of @entity87 , ' @entity82 said , adding that @entity0 ' immediately can reach an audience that we would n't otherwise reach			1
' @entity0 earned his @entity92 as a 15 - year - old growing up in @entity94 , @entity95			2
he has long credited that achievement for giving him the confidence to excel in nearly five decades of public service , and he stayed involved in scouting during his career			0
he has recalled skeet - shooting with young scouts while he was director of the @entity65			1
along the way , @entity0 became known as someone willing to speak frankly about problems in the institutions he led , often at the risk of offending others			0
@entity0 warned @entity2 's leaders friday that ' maybe it 's time for blunt talk			1
' bleeding money : the @entity2 has been losing sponsors and corporate donors over the group 's exclusion of openly gay adults over the last decade , the @entity2 have faced small , but consistent declines in membership			2
also , high - profile sponsors and corporate donors , including @entity121 and @entity122 , have cut funding over the exclusion of openly gay adults			0
meanwhile , a handful of conservatives who opposed the inclusion of openly gay boys started their own organization , @entity130			0
key difference : @entity0 , 70 , said unlike with in the @entity65 or @entity80 , he can not give a direct order to embrace openly gay adults to a group made up of volunteers @entity0 told the @entity29 that he wanted to move the @entity2 past that debate and focus on what unites the membership			1
he said he would push for a heavier focus on local marketing and sharing positive stories about scouting efforts that are sometimes drowned out by debates over gay rights or child abuse lawsuits filed against the @entity2 in several states			0
he said he would emphasize to sponsors that ' welcoming gay youth is an important step forward			0
' gates led the @entity80 when it phased out the ban on openly gay soldiers known as ' @entity17 , ' something gay - rights groups have cited as a hopeful sign for them			2
but @entity0 said friday that the @entity2 were different from the @entity65 or the military , where ' i could give an order and people would follow it , at least most of the time			1
' in an organization driven almost entirely by volunteers , officials have to respect differences in opinion , he said			0
' the key at this point is to keep focus , again , on the top priority , which is , how do we develop the best possible program for kids , and how do we keep their interests at the forefront ? ' @entity0 said .			0
