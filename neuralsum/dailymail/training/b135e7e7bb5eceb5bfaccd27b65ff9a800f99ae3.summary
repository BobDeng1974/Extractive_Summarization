anger : a photo by ' @entity2 ' was in fact of unsuspecting @entity4 , from @entity5 a @entity7 mp plans to make a formal complaint over allegations of ' entrapment ' against a newspaper that forced @entity12 to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself			1
@entity15 said the story could be a test case for the new press regulator , the @entity18			2
charities minister mr @entity12 was forced to quit after allegedly sending a picture of himself wearing @entity21 pyjamas to a journalist , masquerading as ' @entity2 ' , via the instant messaging app @entity23			1
mr @entity12 admitted : ' i have been a complete fool			2
' however , lawyers and media commentators questioned whether there was a public interest in using subterfuge to get the @entity7 mp to exchange explicit images with an undercover reporter , who was working for the @entity33			1
some even suggested that the paper may have committed a criminal offence by ‘ tricking ’ mr @entity12 into sexual activity			2
a male journalist working for the @entity33 set up a fake @entity39 account in the name of @entity2 , supposedly a pretty blonde in her 20s working in @entity42 ‘ @entity2 ’ described herself as a ‘ twenty - something @entity7 pr girl ’ in @entity46 , and her flirty and flattering tweets attracted the attention of several @entity7 mps – including married minister mr @entity12			1
fellow @entity7 mp , mr @entity15 , said on @entity39 he would be referring the story to the @entity18 ( @entity51 ) , which recently replaced the @entity18			1
he told his 3,200 @entity39 followers : " test case for @entity18 will be making formal complaint over attempted entrapment by @entity33			1
" speaking to the @entity56 , he said : " it is in the public interest that their actions are fully investigated			1
this is the first real test as to whether the new body , @entity51 , has any teeth			0
" @entity64 said the story was in the public interest			1
@entity67 , @entity33 weekend editor , told the @entity68 : " this investigation was brought to the @entity33 by a freelance reporter			1
' the investigation , which had a clear public interest , was carried out following information from a reliable source			1
" @entity18 's code of practice states editors must justify intrusions into people ’s private lives , including when using digital communications			0
it adds : ‘ engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge , including by agents or intermediaries , can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material can not be obtained by other means			1
’ @entity89 , media lawyer at @entity90 , said : ‘ i think many members of the public reading the @entity33 story will consider that it does amount to entrapment – particularly if you look at when the story has been used			1
’ and criminal barrister @entity99 wrote on his blog yesterday : ‘ what conceivable public interest was served by tricking mr @entity12 in this way ? ' @entity104 , editor - in - chief of the @entity105 and @entity33 , defended the story after former @entity56 journalist @entity106 claimed it was ‘ unethical ’			1
he tweeted : ‘ 1 ) it was n’t a @entity33 sting 2 ) there ’s a nailed - on public interest			1
’ the pictures of ‘ @entity2 ’ on the account appear to have simply been taken from the internet			1
they show at least two different women – one an unsuspecting young woman from @entity5 and the other a blonde model from @entity120 , who yesterday made furious claims she had been ‘ exploited ’			2
although the name @entity2 was selected for the account , it bears no connection to any real person with that name			1
alluring : this picture of ' miss @entity129 's ' legs - actually miss @entity4 's - was used as the journalist encouraged mr @entity12 to send explicit images			2
miss @entity4 said the mp had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign however , the bogus profile was still enough to persuade the married @entity7 minister he was chatting to a young woman – a conversation which culminated in him sending an x-rated photo			2
the journalist also tried to charm a series of conservative politicians as ‘ @entity142 ’ – and a number replied			2
‘ she ’ described newly - elected @entity145 mp @entity144 , 32 , as a ‘ fitty ’ , and called housing minister @entity146 , 43 , a ‘ legend ’			2
the reporter also tried to flirt with @entity7 mp @entity149 , 43 , after he posted a picture of himself with two dogs at a pet shop in his @entity154 constituency – although the mp simply acknowledged it with a polite reply			1
other @entity7 politicians lauded by ‘ @entity142 ’ included @entity159 , 40 , @entity15 , 47 , and @entity160 , 55			2
the journalist also used the account to tweet about boozy work nights out , sunbathing and sport as well as conservative policies			0
there is no suggestion that any mp apart from mr @entity12 behaved inappropriately or sent any explicit material			0
the fake @entity39 profile was set up in may and has now been deleted			0
its profile photograph was yesterday revealed to be @entity120 model @entity172 , 22 , who last night said it was ‘ offensive ’ to use her image without permission			0
' ‘ i have had a lot of emails , texts and phonecalls from different countries about it			0
it feels unreal , ’ she tells @entity177			0
‘ i do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible , both for me and others involved in this			2
’ on her blog she writes : ‘ i feel very confused right now and still ca n’t comprehend that what has happened has happened			0
i can blog more about this another day , but right now i ca n’t bare to talk about it			0
’ enticing : the @entity39 profile picture of ' @entity2 ' , who is really a @entity120 model uninvolved in the sting			1
@entity172 , 22 , last night said it was ‘ offensive ’ to use her image without permission ‘ this thing feels really unpleasant			0
’ the undercover reporter also used another enticing picture from a young @entity205 woman ’s @entity39 page as part of the deception			2
during the summer heatwave , ‘ @entity142 ’ tweeted ‘ cheeky early finish on a friday # lappingupthesun ’			0
it was illustrated with a selfie of a woman ’s tanned legs , which was taken from a tweet sent the previous day by @entity4 , 26 , from @entity215 , @entity5			0
miss @entity4 told the @entity216 she was upset that the @entity33 had hijacked her photo for use in its sting			1
she said mr @entity12 had nothing to be ashamed of and should have felt no need to resign			0
' i think grown adults can do whatever they like as long as both of them are over the age of consent , ' she said , adding that she hoped mr @entity12 was okay and revealing she felt ' awful ' about her unwitting role in his downfall			0
disgraced : @entity12 with his wife @entity229 , just after he was elected mp for @entity230 in 2005 ' the fact that a newspaper was stealing my photograph is quite wrong			0
the newspaper ’s taken it too far , ' she said of the @entity33 reporter 's use of her photograph			1
the main focus of the journalist ’s investigation appears to have been mr @entity12 , 56			0
‘ @entity142 ’ retweeted several of his postings , which covered everything from a concert by the @entity247 to a briefing by charities about their work in @entity251			0
she wrote ‘ haha ! ’ when the mp complained about people phoning him during the @entity255 men ’s final in july			0
when mr @entity12 posted a picture of himself with a dog called ‘ @entity260 ’ at a fete in his @entity230 constituency , she commented : ‘ aww ! ’ only one of mr @entity12 ’s replies to ‘ @entity263 ’ survives			0
on june 15 he simply wrote : ‘ delighted ! ’			0

' @entity2 ' was an online alter - ego used by a reporter for the @entity33
he used her persona to tempt the interest of a number of @entity7 mps
women whose pictures were used say they are *unhappy* at being involved
lawyers questioned whether sting could be justified in public interest
one said : ' i think members of public will consider it amounts to entrapment '
