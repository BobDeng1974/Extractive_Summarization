the number of people killed by @entity2 has reached almost 7,000 as it emerged the @entity3 has missed ambitious targets to contain the deadly disease			1
the death toll currently stands at 6,928 , according to the @entity8 health agency , with the total number of people infected with the killer virus having surpassed 16,000			1
the figures , released today , come almost two months after the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in @entity15 - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest - hit countries of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 by december 1			1
pictured : health workers in @entity19 the health agency had launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in @entity15 - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest - hit countries of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 by tomorrow new data shows there have been a total of 16,169 cases in those three countries alone , and approximately three dozen cases elsewhere			1
@entity19 has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths , but the rate of infection is currently slowing there			2
in contrast , the disease is now spreading fastest in @entity20			0
out of the three @entity15 countries , only @entity18 is on track to meet the december 1 goal , according to an update from @entity3			1
in @entity19 , only 23 per cent of cases are isolated and 26 per cent of the required burial teams are in place			2
in @entity20 , about 40 per cent of cases are isolated while 27 per cent of burial teams are prepared and ready			0
with the target date of tomorrow looming , it is almost certain @entity3 's goals will be missed - marking another failure in attempts to slow the biggest - ever outbreak of the deadly disease			1
the outbreak of @entity2 was first reported in @entity18 in march and spiralled out of control after being declared a public health emergency in august			2
dr. @entity61 , who is directing the @entity3 's response to @entity2 , acknowledged in october that reaching the december 1 goal would be ' really pushing the system hard			1
' out of the three @entity15 countries worst - hit , only @entity18 is on track to meet the @entity3 's december 1 goal failure to meet the targets marks further problems in attempts to slow the biggest - ever outbreak of the virus the disease is now spreading fastest in @entity20 , where there has been a severe surge in cases recently he said : ' if we do n't do it in 60 days and we take 90 days : no. 1 , a lot more people will die that should n't ; and no. 2 , we will need that much more capacity on the ground to be able to manage the caseload			1
' in recent weeks , there have been some successes in curbing the deadly disease , with cases in @entity19 and @entity18 appearing to be declining or stabilising			1
however , the areas around @entity20 's capital and a district in the country 's north are seeing a severe surge in cases			0
the december 1 targets had been met in many places - but not all , which was the goal , said @entity101 , who is heading the @entity8 's @entity2 response			1
' there are still going to be many people who catch the disease and many people who die from it , ' he said			0
even if the december 1 targets had been reached , @entity3 and others had predicted @entity2 would continue infecting people in @entity15 and possibly elsewhere until sometime next year			1
@entity110 , of @entity111 in @entity112 , who sits on @entity3 's @entity114 committee , said failing to reach the target now suggests @entity2 will spread even further as capacities to respond become even more stretched			1
' we need to redouble our efforts to see what we can do to reduce the spread and catch up with the virus , ' he said			0
' right now , it does n't look good			0
' earlier this month , the @entity123 announced it was scaling back the size and number of @entity2 clinics it had initially promised to build in @entity19 , citing a drop in cases			1
the @entity3 now plans to isolate all patients by january 1 december 6 , 2013 - @entity2 claims the life of its first victim in @entity18 , thought to be a two - year - old from a remote village			1
the toddler , scientists believe was patient zero , suffered a fever , black stools and vomiting			0
march 25 , 2014 - the @entity18 authorities report the outbreak to the @entity3 after diagnosing the virus as @entity2			1
by this stage deaths from the virus was still confined to @entity18			0
may 2014 - it appeared as though the outbreak may be slowing , as the death toll tailed off			0
may 2014 - a very well - known woman from @entity18 , a traditional medical practitioner and leader of a secret society died from the virus , professor @entity148 said			0

august 8 , 2014 - the @entity3 declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern			2
other experts said the @entity3 goals were never very significant			0
@entity172 , director of the centre for the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the @entity176 , said : ' you want to isolate 100 per cent of patients with @entity2 and have 100 per cent safe burials			2
' getting to 70 per cent does n't really mean a lot			0
' dr. @entity181 , an @entity2 expert who previously worked for the @entity3 , said : ' we hope that what we 're seeing in @entity19 will continue , but unfortunately what can happen with @entity2 is that it can go to new countries , as it has already to @entity186			2
' the most dangerous thing would be if people now think @entity2 is over and become complacent			2
' earlier this month , the @entity123 announced it was scaling back the size and number of @entity2 clinics it had initially promised to build in @entity19 , citing a drop in cases			2
mr @entity101 said the critical gap in those locations were new beds and that ending @entity2 would be a long , hard fight			0
' we 're by no means out of the woods yet , but we 're headed in the right direction , ' he said			0
