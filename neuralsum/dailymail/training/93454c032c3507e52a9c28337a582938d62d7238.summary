a 101 - year - old woman who lived through the @entity1 received a standing ovation after giving a rousing 90 - minute talk to an unemployment group			1
@entity5 spoke without notes about a difficult childhood which saw her defy her alcoholic father 's wishes to attend grammar school - a five - mile walk away each day - and train as a teacher			1
the 30 job - seeking adult learners at @entity16 's @entity15 were so impressed she has now been nominated for a local award			1
inspiring : now 101 , @entity5 ( left today and right in her youth ) received a standing ovation when she gave an inspiring talk to unemployed adult learners in @entity16 about the importance of education ms @entity5 's talk began with her childhood in @entity16 , where she was born in 1913			1
she attended school aged five but her alcoholic father , who returned from the @entity28 with ' shell shock ' - now known as post-traumatic stress disorder - wanted her at home			1
when she turned 11 he tried to stop her attending the local grammar school , too			2
' he wanted me at home looking after my four little brothers and my sister , ' she said			1
' but even though it involved a five mile walk and two train journeys every day , i was determined to be educated '			1
thanks to her endurance ms @entity5 earned the qualifications to embark on a two - year teacher training course in 1932			1
strong - willed : as a child , ms @entity5 's alcoholic father wanted to stop her from attending school but before she had the chance to begin her career , the @entity1 struck			1
she was left having to search for work , and eventually secured a teaching position in @entity52 , @entity53			0
' i know what it 's like when you ca n't find work through no fault of your own , and that 's what i told them during my talk , ' she said			2
the talk also took in major events throughout her lifetime such as the miners ' strike and the 27 - year imprisonment of @entity70 , who she described as one of her heroes			2
the struggle for ms @entity5 did not end when she found a job , however			2
she told the adult learners she was angry that would have to give up her job if she found a husband			1
that never happened , however - as in the same year that she met her future husband @entity81 , the @entity79 broke out			0
because men were needed to fight overseas , she could continue teaching , albeit with a Â£ 1 - a - week pay cut			0
it meant she was lucky never to experience long - term unemployment again , and retired happily at the age of 60 after separating from her husband			2
ms @entity5 's talk was arranged by a reminiscence group at the @entity91 where she lives in @entity92 , @entity93			1
afterwards she said she had wanted to support people who were struggling to find work by sharing her experiences , having lived through war and the worst recessions of the @entity99			0
the home 's activities co-ordinator @entity100 said : ' @entity5 is just amazing			1
when she gave her talk , the audience were absolutely fascinated			2
' her memory is crystal clear and she brought events they 'd only read about , to life			0
we are now hoping to line up more talks for her - she really is an inspiration			0
' ms @entity5 has now been nominated for an award by a ' @entity114 ' in the city , which helps find qualifications for people without a job			2
education : ms @entity5 ( back row , far right ) as a teacher at @entity122 in @entity123			1
the struggle did not end when she found work , she said - as she found institutional sexism in the school system the @entity1 began with the @entity128 in october 1929 , when years of rapid growth and hedonistic wealth reached a sudden peak			0
images of distraught stock market traders hurling themselves from the newly - built skyscrapers of @entity135 , days after the crash , became some of the most harrowing of the @entity99			0
in the @entity140 , almost half the country 's banks failed and up to 15million were out of work - but the pain was also felt keenly in @entity143			0
by 1933 a quarter of the @entity143 workforce was jobless			0
the people of @entity147 , near @entity16 , even arranged a ' crusade ' march on @entity150 - whereupon they were told to go home and figure it out for themselves			1
the @entity1 was only fully over once preparations began for the @entity79 - an effort which cost millions and prompted an obvious boom in manufacturing			0
it was often said to be the worst in @entity143 history , but many economists have suggested the current slump is worse			0
although the crash of 1929 was much more dramatic than that in 2008 , analysis by @entity164 suggests the economy picked up again more quickly afterwards			0
@entity143 @entity166 has largely flatlined since the crash , according to the analysts - compared to the depression where it lifted beyond the pre- 1929 level after the worst was over .			0

adult learners gave @entity5 standing ovation after @entity16 talk
she had to walk five miles to school each day to become a teacher
that was despite the wishes of alcoholic father who wanted her at home
she then endured long unemployment in world 's most *infamous* recession
