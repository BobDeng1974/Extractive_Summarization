global internet companies have become ‘ the command and control networks of choice ’ for terrorists , claims the new head of @entity6 ’s electronic spying agency			1
@entity8 director @entity7 insisted some were ‘ in denial ’ about the way fanatics misuse their services			1
he cited how @entity13 ( @entity14 ) has exploited social media for recruitment and propaganda – using the likes of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 to promote beheadings			0
the terror group and its followers have also sent up to 40,000 tweets a day			0
an aerial view of @entity8 in @entity27 , in the suburbs of @entity29 , @entity30 : the agency 's new chief says internet firms need to open up even more to state spies mr @entity7 called on the likes of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity19 and @entity38 to give greater co-operation to @entity8 and sister agencies @entity41 and @entity42			1
he also said there was ‘ no doubt ’ young foreign fighters had benefited from the treasure trove of intelligence secrets leaked by fugitive @entity49 worker @entity48			1
‘ @entity8 and its sister agencies … can not tackle these challenges without greater support from the private sector , including the largest @entity55 technology companies which dominate the web , ’ he said			1
‘ i understand why they have an uneasy relationship with governments			2
they aspire to be neutral conduits of data and to sit outside or above politics			0
‘ but increasingly their services not only host the material of violent extremism or child exploitation , but are the routes for the facilitation of crime and terrorism			1
‘ however much they may dislike it , they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals , who find their services as transformational as the rest of us			1
’ officials say the job of spy agencies has become ‘ much harder ’ over the past 18 months as @entity55 firms become less willing to hand over data			1
@entity89 sources say the companies have changed how they behave in response to the @entity48 revelations			0
his exposure of how @entity8 and @entity55 ’s @entity95 were able to tap into online data has made companies nervous about protecting their own reputations , they said			1
writing in the @entity99 , mr @entity7 said mobile technology and smartphones have increased the options available to terrorists ‘ exponentially ’			1
@entity8 director @entity7 ( left ) said internet firms needed to allow the state to police on - line traffic			1
@entity95 leaker @entity48 ( right ) , revealed intensive collaboration between spy agencies and internet companies what they know ... a @entity95 slide leaked by @entity48 reveals the scale of the access that state spies have to internet users ' personal communications and information he said : ‘ techniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous , which were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation states , now come as standard			2
these are supplemented by freely available programs and apps adding extra layers of security , many of them proudly advertising that they are “ @entity48 approved ”			0
‘ there is no doubt that young foreign fighters have learnt and benefited from the leaks of the past two years			2
the challenge to governments and their intelligence agencies is huge and it can only be met with greater co-operation from technology companies			0
terrorists have long made use of the internet			0
but @entity14 ’s approach is different in two important areas			0
‘ where @entity145 and its affiliates saw the internet as a place to disseminate material anonymously , is has embraced the web as a noisy channel in which to promote itself , intimidate people , and radicalise new recruits			0
’ intelligence sources have previously warned how @entity48 ’s revelations – mainly published by the @entity156 in the @entity6 – have made it harder to track the movements and tactics of is because they have become better at knowing how to avoid detection			0
mr @entity7 went on : ‘ for our part , intelligence agencies such as @entity8 need to enter the public debate about privacy			1
‘ we need to show how we are accountable for the data we use to protect people , just as the private sector is increasingly under pressure to show how it filters and sells its customers ’ data			2
‘ @entity8 is happy to be part of a mature debate on privacy in the digital age			1
but privacy has never been an absolute right and the debate about this should not become a reason for postponing urgent and difficult decisions			0
to those of us who have to tackle the depressing end of human behaviour on the internet , it can seem some technology companies are in denial about its misuse			2
‘ i suspect most ordinary users of the internet are ahead of them : they have strong views on the ethics of companies , whether on taxation , child protection or privacy ; they do not want the media platforms they use with their friends and families to facilitate murder or child abuse			2
‘ they know the internet grew out of the values of @entity205 democracy , not vice versa			0
i think those customers would be comfortable with a better , more sustainable relationship between the agencies and the technology companies			0
’ @entity210 , an ex-home office minister who sits on @entity212 ’s @entity211 , recently said is militants would be ‘ very much aware ’ of what @entity48 had made public			2
she said : ‘ as an organisation that appears to be very tech savvy and certainly social media savvy , it is inevitably going to adjust its behaviour in relation to what it knows the security agencies can do			0
