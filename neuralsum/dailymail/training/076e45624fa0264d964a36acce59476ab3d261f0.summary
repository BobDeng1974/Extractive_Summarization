to get in touch with @entity1 , leave your comments below or send your tweets to @ @entity5 using # tacklekeown @entity7 columnist @entity6 answered your questions after another interesting week of @entity10 football , including @entity12 's disappointing 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity14 on wednesday night			1
the former @entity15 and @entity17 defender analysed the tie at the @entity19 , with subjects ranging from @entity22 's abject performance and @entity24 's tactics to whether @entity25 is lacking quality in the big games			1
also on the agenda was the small matter of the @entity31 final this weekend as @entity32 play @entity33 at @entity34 , as well as the quality of @entity37 football			1
read on to find out ... host commentator host commentator there ’s no conspiracy , @entity41 - no way ! it ’s all propaganda from @entity44			1
it was a big statement for him to go on @entity48 - a company he does n’t have the best of relationships with - and say they , and referees , do n’t give him a fair deal			2
i think it ’s disrespectful to the @entity56 and everything it stands for			1
fair competition is the basis of every good competition – if you win the @entity56 , you deserve to			1
but if you question it , like @entity44 is doing , you question the integrity of the game			1
i ’m not fooled by his charm and magnetism , but people seem scared to speak out against him			1
perhaps they do n’t want to get involved in a slanging match , but he needs to be pulled up about this			0
look at @entity75 after @entity77 ’s loss to @entity78 on sunday			0
he could have completely gone off on one about the penalties they should have been awarded , or that @entity81 should have been sent off			0
there was no mention of campaigns or conspiracies by him			0
people know that players get tired over busy periods , but what about the referees ? players are supported after a match , people at the club will tell where they went wrong and help to prepare them for the next match			0
but a referee is his own entity and has to pick up pieces in isolation			0
it must affect their confidence after a bad game			0
they need help and support the same way players do			0
what else is difficult for a referee is that he has no idea of the feeling of being wronged like players do			0
it ’s so frustrating when you try to plead with the referee , but it seeps into your performance			0
you feel like you ’ve been sinned			0
it used to wind me up when we played @entity122 and referees would call the players by their first names			0
but the second i was in trouble it was , ‘ @entity6 , get over here ! ’			1
it was a terrible tackle and i would expect @entity130 to be angry			0
as i 'm sure you would			2
i think you have to allow someone the emotion to react , to a certain extent , but it has cost him a place in sunday ’s cup final			2
it seems unfair , as he could 've had leg broken			2
but he has to know that you ca n’t do that			0
he should have just laid on the pitch			0
players go down with far less these days , and it looked to me like he had the right to be rolling around on the floor for the next ten minutes			2
i do n’t think i would 've reacted the same as @entity130 , i would have stayed on the floor , pointing at my leg in exasperated fashion , hoping the officials would sort out the situation			2
one time when we played @entity32 , @entity154 punched me on the back of the head so hard i felt his knuckles			1
my first thought was to clump him back , but i quickly changed my mind and went down and he was sent off			2
there ’s an automatic process that kicks in to stop you punching someone on the pitch			0
unfortunately for me , @entity166 was on hand to walk all over the top of me while i was on the floor , until @entity170 dragged him off , that is			0
i think @entity32 will win it , @entity173			1
@entity33 ’s 5 - 3 win at @entity175 this season was astonishing , but when you get to a final it ’s different			1
it ’s where the inexperience of the likes of @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 may be a problem			0
there ’s know - how in @entity32 team			1
they know how to to dictate the pace of the game and play it at their own pace			2
@entity33 will be confident after their victory on @entity196 , but this is not at home - it ’s at @entity34			1
they ’ll have to put the pressure and fanfare of the final to one side and concentrate on the game			1
@entity32 have done all this before			1
@entity205 has only had one or two bad games this season , including the one you mention , @entity208 , but has found himself out of the team			2
@entity44 often looks for blame and has clearly identified @entity205 as culpable in certain matches			1
@entity212 is developing nicely , but in the long term i would think he will partner @entity205 , not @entity215			1
at the moment , @entity44 is showing that @entity215 will stay in the team regardless , but it might be different next year			1
maybe @entity44 is testing @entity205 - seeing how he responds to falling down the pecking order			1
@entity212 definitely looks like he has the potential to be top class			1
when he hones in on an opposition player he can make it very difficult for them			0
when @entity32 played @entity224 he dealt with @entity225 comfortably , and he ’s one of the quickest and strongest strikers in the league			1
i 've always been a keen admirer of @entity229 , @entity230			1
but he needs to wait for the game to come to him and not go flying in			2
he went flying in too often against @entity232 on tuesday when he would have been better off keeping the shape of the defence in tact			1
i think he might have come back from injury before he was ready to			1
he ’s a big man who needs to be a 100 per cent fit to carry that huge frame around			0
he ’s a very important player for them , but he ’s often guilty of wanting to do everyone else ’s job – it ’s part of his nature			0
playing centre half is about being in the right place at right time			2
if you rush out of position you can leave big spaces in behind for attackers to move into			0
he would have been embarrassed by what happened , @entity255			0
he carries the flag for @entity257 around @entity258			0
since he left , @entity257 have won the @entity259 and the @entity260			0
the @entity257 are very proud of him			0
last night could be a defining moment			0
they dominated possession but got thumped			0
i think he might rethink his tactics			0
he sees everything and is a quick learner			0
he has to decide whether it ’s more important to win or play attractive football			1
last night he did n’t underestimate @entity14 but overestimated his own team			1
it looked like he was trying too hard			1
he was playing against a @entity257 team , and it felt like he wanted to show how far he ’d come			2
he ’s got to get over what happened last night			0
when people say we we had lots of strong characters in our @entity12 team , that ’s because we had all had nightmare games somewhere along the line			1
his goals have been vital to @entity12 , as you mention , but he has to believe he ’s good enough			1
there ’s the option of @entity289 in the middle , but there ’s lots of work to do there as well			0
i think he does too much work for the team tracking back			1
he needs to work on his runs , so he can occupy both centre halves when receiving the ball			0
@entity24 must decide who ’s in the middle sooner rather than later			1
i would n't write @entity12 off , @entity303			1
when you look at number of chances they had last night , they 're still in it			0
though @entity14 might just have too much for them			1
i was very impressed with their defenders – they all looked efficient , strong and good on the break			1
if @entity12 do win it ’d be @entity24 ’s finest hour			1
he ’ll be relishing that he ’ll get another chance to face them , rubbing hands together			0
he ’s a proud @entity257 returning home , but it ’s not a trip for nostalgia - there ’s a job to do			2
he ’s a very determined person , and two early goals would turn the tie on its head			1
well , @entity303 , @entity24 had a nightmare - he knew it would happen , which makes it worse			1
he understood them well enough , but they still got beaten			2
the midfield was packed with imagination and ability , but not enough defensive quality			0
@entity338 was charging about on his own , trying to do it all			0
@entity12 did n’t have balance			2
it was like there was a magnet down the centre of the pitch , and all their players were drawn towards it			0
@entity12 have to learn to play with their heads			1
they ’re either too slow or too manic			0
i think he ’s under pressure			2
@entity353 is there , ready to play , and it looks as if @entity356 will become a centre half , rather than a right back			2
if things do n’t go well , it looks like @entity24 has the necessary players to replace him , unlike in the past			2
you only get so long under @entity24 to stake a claim			2
he always invests time on each player , but he may want to invest time in someone else now			2
look what happened with @entity369 – it ’s debatable whether @entity22 is better			0
i think @entity24 still believes in him , he feels he gives organisation to the defence			1
but it ’s a balancing act with his lack of mobility .			0

@entity6 answers your questions live on *thursday*
former @entity12 and @entity17 defender has his say on issues you *raised*
*gunners* beaten 3 - 1 by @entity14 in the @entity10 last - 16 first leg
you only get so much time under @entity392 is under pressure
i would n't write @entity12 off . @entity24 is a very determined person
it looked like @entity25 was trying too hard at the @entity19
@entity24 did n't underestimate @entity14 , he overestimated his @entity12 team
i think @entity229 was rushed back from injury , he keeps flying in to tackles
@entity32 play @entity33 in the @entity31 final this weekend
i think the @entity408 will win - while @entity212 has impressed me in defence
@entity44 was disrespectful to the @entity56 by *suggesting* there 's a campaign against @entity32 , i 'm not fooled by his charm
