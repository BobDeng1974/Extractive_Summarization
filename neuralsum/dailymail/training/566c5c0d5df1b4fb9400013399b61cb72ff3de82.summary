' uh - uh ! stop ! stop ! no ! because there 's no comparison			0
he [ mr @entity38 ] is running for president			1
' @entity7 says this was typical behavior for the teacher			2
' she always have open discussions about the president and candidates			2
and she does n't want to hear anything but what she believes , ' he said			2
' and if you disagree you get berated and put down			0
i just decided to finally get some proof of it			0
' ' stop ! no ! ' : when a student asked whether @entity4 was ever a bully , the teacher became enraged and demanded that the student say nothing negative about him his mother , @entity79 , said she was horrified when her son played the recording for her			1

' they ca n't take that away ' : the student did not believe the teacher when she said people have been arrested for talking bad about @entity139 the teacher answered that the student needed to stop slandering the current president because ' people were arrested for saying rather poor things about @entity139			1
' unconvinced , the student offers his viewpoint : ' you would have to say some pretty f * * * ed up crap ... to be arrested			0
' they can not take away your right to have your opinion or your freedom of speech			0
they ca n't take that away ... unless you threaten the president			1
' the teacher demands to know whether the student was aware that the police do not always read @entity165 rights when a person gets arrested			2
the student responds : ' well , i 've never been arrested			0
' biased : @entity168 ( right ) , @entity7 's mother , said she is concerned that someone so biased was teaching her son and hundreds of other students after some minimal discussion on how government officials sometimes say negative things about presidents , the teacher make her case that negative comments about mr @entity4 will not be tolerated inside her classroom			2
