by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 5 april 2013 the archbishop of @entity2 yesterday urged @entity3 to raise the amount of taxpayers ' money spent in development aid to poor countries			1
the @entity10 @entity9 called on the prime minister and other national leaders to stick to their pledge to increase aid because ' development is working '			1
dr @entity9 said numbers living in extreme poverty in the world had halved since 1990 and said more could be done , ' but only if governments do not waver from the moral and political commitments that they made more than a decade ago			1
' the @entity23 and @entity24 @entity9 , the lord archbishop of @entity2 has asked @entity3 to invest more in foreign aid mr @entity3 has promised to raise @entity27 aid spending to 0.7 per cent of national income in line with ' @entity31 ' targets set by the @entity32			1
at present spending is around 0.56 per cent , about £ 9 billion a year			2
the @entity34 promises to hit the target figure next year , a pledge which will take @entity27 aid spending over the £ 10 billion mark			0
the prime minister is under pressure from backbench critics to cut aid on the grounds that most of it is wasted , abused or sucked up by corrupt regimes , and developing countries are better helped by growing trade			0
the archbishop , who made his call in a letter to the @entity51 together with a group of other religious leaders , said financial crisis was not an excuse for cutting aid and governments should ' fulfil existing commitments to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid			2
' dr @entity9 's letter was also backed by the leader of @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64 , archbishop of westminster @entity65 , other @entity67 and @entity69 figureheads , together with @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 leaders , and spokesmen from more minor faiths			1
mr @entity3 has promised to raise @entity27 aid spending to 0.7 per cent of national income in line with ' @entity31 ' targets set by the @entity32 the letter said leaders of the @entity82 group of the wealthiest countries should stick to the @entity32 targets , which are supposed to be met by 2015			0
but challenges remain , ' the leaders said			0
' the number of people living in extreme poverty has been halved ahead of time and 14,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990			1
' yet one in eight people still goes to bed hungry every night and more than two million die of malnutrition every year			0
' dr @entity9 and his fellow leaders added : ' the financial crisis may be a reason but is not an excuse for deferral			1
mp @entity102 dopes not believe that improvements in developing countries are down to foreign aid from the west ' in addition to providing for the wellbeing of our own societies , we have a collective responsibility to uphold human dignity and the common good at the global level			0
' the letter said @entity82 countries should co-operate to stop untaxed wealth being hidden and to encourage more open finances in developing countries			0
however the claim that development aid has been responsible for reducing poverty over the past two decades met a scathing response from economists and @entity125 mps , who said economic growth in @entity131 , the @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 has been the overwhelming reason why people are better off			1
@entity125 mp for @entity135 said : ' i grew up in one of the poorest countries on the planet , where my parents worked as doctors in a mission hospital			0
i can tell you the improvement in living standards in @entity146 and @entity128 has not been brought about by aid			2
' development aid is a government - to - government subsidy that has only encouraged corruption			1
@entity146 and @entity128 have improved because @entity128 are joining the global marketplace , because of the impact of individual donors like @entity154 , and because of new technology			0
' economist @entity156 of the @entity157 said : ' aid is of residual importance , to be kind to it			0
what has brought people out of poverty is economic growth			2
' it has not been aid that has taken people out of poverty in @entity131 and @entity127 , and what governments really need to do get rid of poverty is to adopt pro-growth policies			2

the @entity10 @entity9 said ' development is working '
added that numbers living in poverty in the world had halved since 1990
the archbishop believes that more can be done by the government
