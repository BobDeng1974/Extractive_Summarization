he said : ' he had seen some of my work before and asked if i wanted to create a montage of that			0
the only thing i had was the characters and none of the backgrounds			0
' it was a judgement of what we could do and would be most effective on camera initially			0
i suppose the trickiest thing was keeping it as accurate as possible and making sure it was instantly recognisable			0
it was mostly pretty straightforward			0
it was more the set design and making it look good on camera			0
' @entity5 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , pictured left with his designs and right at the launch of the @entity4 exhibition , made the video as part of a project led by @entity4 masterbuilder @entity56 @entity5 's favourite scene - and the first to feature on the film - is from @entity51			1

pictured : a scene from @entity21 other iconic scenes - which @entity5 tried to keep as close to the original as possible - include this scene of ' the lift ' from @entity16 @entity4 - loving @entity5 used his bedroom for his films , having set up a small studio			1
pictured : a @entity4 scene from @entity121 it took @entity5 three weeks to put the two - minute video together , which by stop - motion standards is ' a quick turnaround ' , he said			1

my favourite one was @entity51 because it 's such an iconic film scene and it 's so recognisable			0
' each scene - lasting just a few seconds at a time - took between 15 minutes to two hours to film			2

' @entity5 became interested in stop - motion movie - making in 2011 , after creating a film for a school project			1
pictured : a scene from @entity143 the teenager focussed on @entity10 classics and scenes which would be easy to recognise , including this from @entity143 @entity5 also put together a scene from @entity20 for the film			1
he said he likes using @entity4 because it ' lets the imagination run free ' another scene he created was from @entity151 , featuring all of the main characters and the famous @entity153 @entity5 has already achieved fame by creating a music video for superstar dj @entity156 he has his sights set on film - making as a future career , with plans to study the subject once he finishes school			1
pictured : @entity46 in breakfast at @entity164 @entity5 first became interested in stop - motion film - making in 2011 , after creating a film for a @entity168 project at school			1
he said : ' i thought i could maybe do something different			0
i animated @entity173 planes in a @entity175 dog fight			0

then i branched into commercial work			0
