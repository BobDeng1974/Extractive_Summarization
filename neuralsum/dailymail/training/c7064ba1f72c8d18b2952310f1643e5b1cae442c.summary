but although he was told he would be deported as long ago as 2006 , @entity16 - born @entity1 - whose father lives in the @entity6 - used @entity14 of the @entity15 to successfully appeal the order , arguing he had a ‘ right to family life			1
’ yet he was then convicted of a string of further drug trafficking offences - claiming he was ‘ emotionally scarred into drug taking ’ by his experiences after being born in a refugee camp in the @entity16 @entity24			1
when he was again warned he would be deported back to @entity25 , @entity1 again used @entity14 in a bid to stay in the @entity6			1
today it was revealed that after a series of legal battles and appeals , an immigration judge has ordered @entity1 to be sent back to @entity25 - saying the criminal had an ‘ appalling history			1
’ it is thought the case will have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds in legal fees			0

’ @entity1 was allowed indefinite leave himself in 1998 in line with his father and attempted to get @entity6 citizenship			1
but in 2003 he was convicted of a series of offences including resisting police and possessing class a drugs			1
the following year he was back in court for drugs offences and in september of that year he was jailed for four years for dealing crack cocaine and heroin			1
in april 2006 , @entity1 was told he would be deported but in may the following year he lodged an appeal under @entity14 and won the right to stay			1
in december 2008 , he was repeatedly brought into court where he was convicted of possessing cannabis , cocaine and breaching court orders			2
then at @entity65 in october 2010 , @entity1 was convicted of intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine and manufacturing crack was jailed for six years			1
the court heard @entity1 had turned an empty flat into a drugs factory and police recovered heroin and crack cocaine worth almost £ 25,000			1
detectives said his commercial dealing on ‘ a significant scale ’ and was said to be close to the importation of drugs			0
@entity1 kept £ 4,000 in cash at his home and officers found a receipt for a £ 6,000 @entity85 watch			2
he was also was driving around in a £ 60,000 @entity86			0
at the time , @entity1 claimed he had spent the first eight years of his life in a refugee camp on the @entity16 @entity24			1
he said his experiences in the camp were ‘ horrific ’ and he was so ‘ scarred ’ by what he saw he experimented with cannabis when he was 13 - five years after he arrived in the @entity6			2

in 2011 , @entity1 was warned he faced deportation yet in 2012 but he again claimed it would result in a ‘ breach of his human rights			1
’ whilst his appeal was in the pipeline , in 2013 he was convicted of money laundering and jailed for an extra 21 months after @entity107 was told he used drugs money to buy an @entity109 for £ 44,000			2
later that year he was ordered to pay back £ 37,147.06 as proceeds of crime			2
the appeal came to a tribunal in @entity114 , @entity115 , on october last year an immigration panel ordered he be deported saying removal would ‘ not be disproportionate			2
’ the panel concluded his offending was ‘ simply too serious to outweigh his claims to remain in the @entity6 because of his history			0
’ the panel said his length of time in the @entity6 was ‘ outweighed by the public interest in keeping society safe from a perennial offender who they believed in all likelihood would be a serious threat to individuals			0
’ but @entity1 appealed to the @entity132 in @entity133 and used human rights laws to argue he would be at ‘ risk of harm ’ if he was returned to @entity25			1
his lawyer @entity137 claimed @entity1 's safety could be in jeopardy because his uncle had been killed by @entity142 forces during militia insurgency in 1989			2

she claimed at best , he would be turned away by the @entity142 and at worst he would be at risk of harm because of his ‘ history ’ and the history of his uncle			0
' i am satisfied , given this appellant 's appalling history , that the appeal fails ' judge @entity162 she said the length of time @entity1 had been away from @entity25 in itself , would cause him to be at risk of enquiry by the @entity142 authorities , who would want to know why he had been out of @entity25 for 20 years			2
but rejecting the appeal on april 3 , judge @entity162 said : ‘ i am satisfied , given this appellant 's appalling history , that the appeal fails			0
the appellant has not raised an asylum claim			0
‘ he had not raised an @entity177 claim and given that he was represented throughout , if there was a serious possibility that on his return he would be at risk , then i have no doubt whatsoever that it would have been raised as an asylum claim or an @entity177 claim			0
‘ i find that there are no errs of law in this determination , which i uphold			0
’ last year , 200 offenders – including rapists and muggers – successfully challenged their removal by citing @entity14 8 of @entity193 ’s @entity15			1

he qualified for automatic deportation after he was jailed for four years , and the @entity207 told him he would be sent home			0
but he was told he can stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under @entity216			0
his lawyers argued that if he was sent back to @entity228 it would separate him from his parents , brother and cousin , who are also in @entity6 , which would breach his rights			0
