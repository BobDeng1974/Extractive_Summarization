@entity0 suffered a fate that has become familiar to so many top @entity3 teams over the years at @entity4 , as they were pounded into submission by @entity7 , after a costly yellow card for @entity9			1
the @entity11 side came here with considerable belief and they were in the hunt for much of an abrasive @entity16 tie			0
@entity18 ’s visitors had shown plenty of their warrior spirit and the fiery competitive streak of their ‘ wolf - pack ’ defence , but the tipping point – quite literally – came in the 52nd minute as @entity27 prop @entity26 was sin - binned for wildly up - ending @entity28 at a ruck			1
before that telling incident , the force increasingly had been with @entity0 in a tight tussle , which was locked at 3 - 3			1
but by the time @entity26 returned to the field , the challenge of the @entity35 team had been fatally undermined , as they trailed by eight points and had emphatically conceded the initiative			1
from then on , the outcome was inevitable			0
@entity9 of @entity0 is shown a yellow card by referee @entity42 during the 14 - 3 defeat vs @entity7 @entity18 , the @entity0 director of rugby , looks on during the 14 - 3 defeat against @entity7 on friday night ‘ the yellow card was a real momentum - swinger , ’ said @entity18 , @entity0 ’ director of rugby			1
‘ the decision ( by the referee ) was fair enough – you ca n’t tip people above the horizontal in the air			0
it was an accident , but @entity7 took advantage of it , as they do			1
once they were ahead , it was n’t a night for playing catch - up rugby			2
’ this was an important night for @entity59 fly - half @entity57 , who was making just his second start of the season , having missed three matches with a quad injury			2
he landed one of his two goal kicks , committed himself with gusto in defence and for a spell began to find some passing rhythm			0
he was also evidently trying to play close to the @entity7 defensive line , whenever the opportunity arose			1
but this was not a game which allowed him to click through the gears and he occasionally appeared to be moving with a lack of freedom – with the recently - damaged leg still strapped			2
yet , @entity18 was satisfied with his playmaker , saying : ‘ i thought he did well			1
‘ it was hard to be our @entity81 tonight because we did n’t have a lot of ball , but when we did we looked dangerous			0
@entity57 played the full 80 minutes , which was important for him			0
’ it was an important night for @entity57 , making his second start of an injury - interrupted early - season period it was @entity57 ’s first full 80 - minute outing this season on friday and @entity59 will be relieved at that news it was @entity57 ’s first full 80 - minute outing this season and @entity59 will be relieved that he has had that precious game - time , providing he does n’t suffer any repercussions in the aftermath			1
while that was good news for national coach @entity101 , he will also have been heartened to see how some of his squad members performed in a match which reached @entity106 intensity at times			0
this was a full - throttle game in a hostile atmosphere and that experience will benefit new @entity59 lock @entity111 , who appeared to cope well with the occasion			0
@entity113 was especially prominent for @entity0 , but he withdrew in the closing stages after a bang to the head			1
the no 8 did n’t appear to be in a bad way , but the national management will be keen to assess him on sunday , in the hope that he is fully fit to join the start of the @entity125 series preparations in @entity126			0
@entity127 ( left ) of @entity7 jumps for the ball against @entity0 ' @entity111 during the hot - blooded tie it was a full - throttle game in a hostile atmosphere but new @entity59 lock @entity111 appeared to cope well friday night ’s defeat was a setback for @entity0 but by no means a devastating blow to their hopes of qualifying for the knock - out stages			1
they were attempting to turn the tide of history in @entity3 ’s final frontier – where the hopes of visiting teams come to die			0
@entity7 may have fallen behind @entity146 rivals @entity145 in the recent roll - call of continental triumph , but they remain the most unwelcoming of hosts			1
in 19 seasons of the old @entity151 they lost just twice in their renowned fortress ; against @entity153 in 2009 and @entity154 three years later			0
once again , they showed why they are so effective at home – harnessing the fervent support from the stands to storm the barricades with a pack onslaught and an astute kicking game led by @entity161			0
yet , for all their command of territory and possession , @entity7 could n’t assume control on the scoreboard as @entity167 had a mixed night in front of goal			2
it was 3 - 3 at the break and that was still the scoreline when @entity26 ’s rash intervention turned the match @entity7 ’s way			1
a scuffle breaks out during the hot - blooded match between @entity7 and @entity0 on friday night they soon had another penalty to their name and despite a seemingly legitimate try by @entity183 being ruled out , @entity181 was driven over seconds later			1
@entity167 capitalised on another powerful assault to knock over a drop goal and the game was up			0
@entity0 had fought the good fight – with @entity189 lock @entity188 the epitome of ferocious defiance – but they could n’t build on last week ’s win over @entity193 by claiming another prized scalp			2
@entity18 was disappointed by the result but said : ‘ i ’m proud of the effort from the players			2
we wanted to come away from this game with something and we were n’t overwhelmed by the occasion but we made too many errors – that was the story of our night			0
but we have five points from our first two games and this pool is wide open			0
’ @entity188 of @entity0 suffered a swollen and bloody eye injury during the defeat for his troubles			2

@entity9 yellow card costs @entity0 as they lose 14 - 3 against @entity7
' the yellow card was a real momentum - swinger , ' says @entity18
by the time @entity26 returned to the field @entity0 were trailing by eight points
