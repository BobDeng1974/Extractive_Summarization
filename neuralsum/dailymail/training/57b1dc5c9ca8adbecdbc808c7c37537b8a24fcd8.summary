@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7 ... 1			1
per @entity8 is a much better defender when he ’s got @entity10 alongside him			1
the 5 - 0 win over @entity12 was the sixth time in the 11 games where both of them played 90 minutes this season that @entity18 have kept a clean sheet			1
meanwhile , in the 12 matches where one or the other was missing , the @entity20 have shut out the opposition only twice			2
per @entity8 ( right ) heads the ball for @entity18 during their comfortable 5 - 0 victory over @entity12 @entity10 ( left ) of @entity18 and @entity26 of @entity12 compete for the ball at the @entity27 @entity8 ( centre ) and @entity10 ( right ) have kept six clean sheets in 11 games in defence together 2			1
@entity32 ca n’t do much more to convince @entity33 he deserves a better contract offer than the one currently on the table			1
talks over a new deal have stalled with the 29 - year - old @entity39 midfielder believing he needs to be treated in a similar bracket to some of @entity33 ’s overseas stars			2
he underlined his point with a selfless display in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity47			0
nobody ran more than his 7.3 miles , and he also recorded the most sprints ( 63 ) of any player on the @entity52 pitch as well as the highest average speed ( 4.6mph )			1
blood trickles down the mouth of midfielder @entity32 during @entity33 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity47 @entity32 ( right ) ran further than anyone else on the pitch and he also recorded the most sprints 3			1
@entity59 and @entity60 both made moves to take @entity63 midfielder @entity62 away from @entity64 during this transfer window but there are good reasons why @entity68 refused to do a deal			2
the 28 - year - old , who has divided opinion since he first arrived at @entity72 in 2007 , has made a huge difference since returning to the regular starting side			2
the 2 - 0 win over @entity76 was the club ’s eighth victory in 12 games that @entity62 has started this season - in 11 games where he was n’t in the opening line - up , @entity72 have won only three times			1
@entity62 ( left ) has attracted transfer interest from both @entity59 and @entity60 after some solid matches @entity62 ( left ) celebrates with @entity85 - during one of the eight wins he has been involved in 4			1
@entity88 rightly took the headlines for the stunning goal that brought @entity91 a much - needed three points at @entity93 , but his midfield partner @entity94 did much of the donkey work to set up the 1 - 0 win			0
@entity94 , who has struggled to get game time during a season - long loan from @entity99 , ran 8.4 miles at @entity100 ’s as he battled to break up the @entity93 ’ normally fluent midfield passing			1
that equalled @entity104 ’s @entity103 as the record for the greatest distance covered by one player during a @entity5 match this season			1
@entity88 claimed the headlines at @entity93 after his stunning strike for @entity91 but midfield partner @entity94 ( left ) did the donkey work and put in a tireless shift against @entity93 5			0
@entity114 has played every minute of every game for @entity116 this season - but nobody else in the @entity118 dressing room can be sure of starting every week			1
manager @entity120 made three changes from his last @entity5 team in the side that beat @entity124 3 - 1 , including giving @entity125 his first start since mid-november			1
the @entity127 either believes in picking his team for the opposition , or still does n’t know his best 11			0
he has only once kept an unchanged team all season			0
@entity114 is the only @entity116 player to feature in every minute of every game this season @entity120 ( right ) has shuffled his pack and only retained the same starting line - up once so far @entity125 ( centre ) returned to the @entity116 starting line - up against @entity124 6			1
it ’s a different story at @entity104 where @entity138 believes in keeping a settled side - he has now named the same starting line - up for nine games in a row			0
the only other manager in the @entity5 era to show such consistency of selection was @entity147 when he was in charge of @entity149			2
he kept the same team for 12 matches between november 2009 and february 2010			2
@entity104 boss @entity138 has kept the same starting line - up for nine matches in a row @entity149 boss @entity147 kept the same side for 12 consecutive games in the 2009 - 10 season 7			1
nobody would suggest that @entity159 might be pleased about the cruciate knee ligament injury that has ruled out mercurial @entity163 @entity162 long term , but it has thrown him a lifeline to revive his career at @entity167			0
the 28 - year - old midfield man got only his fourth @entity5 start of the campaign in the 3 - 1 win over @entity172 and made the most of the chance			2
he made both the first two goals of @entity176 ’ hat - trick , and set up three other chances			0
@entity162 ( right ) grimaces after damaging his cruciate knee ligament for @entity167 last month @entity159 ( left ) came into the @entity167 line - up for the home victory over @entity172 8			0
maybe it is something to do with @entity185 ’s fluent passing style inviting tackles , but referees do seem fond of getting out their red cards to protect the @entity190 leaders			0
when @entity192 got his marching orders from ref @entity194 in the first minute of @entity196 ’s 2 - 0 defeat , he became the seventh player to be sent off playing against @entity199 ’s side in their last 13 games			1
across the whole campaign @entity185 have spent 11.6 per cent of playing time against 10 men , the highest percentage of any side in the @entity7 or @entity205			0
referee @entity194 ( centre ) sends off @entity196 's @entity192 just one minute into the match @entity185 manager @entity199 has seen seven opposition players sent off in their last 13 games 9			1
@entity210 striker @entity209 now has 11 goals from the last 10 games of his loan spell with @entity215 leaders @entity216			0
the 25 - year - old , who struggled at @entity218 following a £ 500,000 summer move from @entity220 , has had his stay at @entity222 extended until march 1			0
city boss @entity223 will get the chance to make the most of him during that time - this saturday ’s trip to title rivals @entity226 will mark the start of a spell of seven games in 21 days			0
@entity210 striker @entity209 ( centre ) has now claimed 11 goals from his last 10 games on loan at @entity216 10			2
a group of cheeky @entity237 fans paid £ 650 to put up a poster in the town hailing their @entity241 club as better than @entity116			0
the logic was that they had beaten @entity244 away this season , while @entity120 ’s men could only draw 0 - 0 when they went to the @entity247			2
perhaps they chose the wrong week to do it , though			0
or maybe they should spend a few more bob for a poster recognising that on that particular form line @entity254 and @entity255 , comfortable 3 - 1 winners against the @entity257 on saturday , should now be considered @entity259 contenders			0
@entity244 held @entity116 to a goalless draw in the @entity262 fourth round			0

@entity8 and @entity10 have kept six clean sheets in 11 games in @entity18 's defence together
@entity32 ran 7.3 miles , recorded the most sprints ( 63 ) , and had the highest average speed ( 4.6mph ) of any player for @entity33
@entity72 have won eight matches from 12 in which @entity62 has played this season , but have claimed only three victories without him
@entity114 is the only @entity116 player to feature in every single minute of the @entity5 this season for @entity120
