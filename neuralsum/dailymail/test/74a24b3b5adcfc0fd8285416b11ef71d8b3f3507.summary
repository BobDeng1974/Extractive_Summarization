what is retrograde amnesia ? amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories			2
it is usually caused by disease or head injury , but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously			0
the memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person 's past or just portions of it			2
in most cases , it is a temporary condition , lasting from a few seconds to a few hours			0
but in severe cases , it can last months or even years			0
there are several different types of amnesia			0
retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness			0
the leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event , a problem with blood circulation around , to or from the brain , or some kind of migraine - like phenomenon			0
usually , the affected person can not remember events shortly before their accident or illness at all , but their memories of the distant past are intact , and there is a gradient of memory loss between the two extremes			2
retrograde amnesia often lasts for a year , before the patient starts to remember things .			0
