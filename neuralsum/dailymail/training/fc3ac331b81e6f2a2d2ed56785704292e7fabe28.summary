a @entity1 spacecraft designed to one day fly astronauts to @entity3 rolled out of its processing hangar at the @entity5 in @entity6 on thursday to be prepared for a debut test flight in december			1
an unmanned version of the gumdrop - shaped @entity9 , which has been under construction for three years , is due to launch aboard a @entity12 rocket on december 4 from nearby @entity13			1
' this is a pretty historic moment for us , ' @entity14 , @entity1 's @entity9 production operations manager , told reporters as workers prepared to move the capsule to a fueling depot			0
' @entity12 is jointly owned by @entity32 and @entity33 in december , @entity9 will be flown to an altitude of about 3,600 miles from @entity35 , 14 times farther away than the @entity36			1
the capsule will then careen back toward the planet , slamming into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph			0
at that speed , @entity9 's thermal protection system should heat up to about 4,000 degrees @entity42 , proving the shield can protect astronauts returning from the moon and other deep - space destinations			2
@entity9 is part of @entity1 's follow - up program to the now - retired space shuttles that will allow astronauts to travel beyond the @entity36 , which flies about 260 miles above @entity35			1
the biggest rocket ever made : the @entity51 will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds @entity1 's ' path to @entity3 ' graphic sets out the steps needed to send humans to an asteroid and @entity3 by the 2030s the sls is larger than the @entity58 rockets than launched man to the @entity60			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity65 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity65 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway @entity5 director @entity68 watches as the @entity9 capsule is wheeled out on thursday			1
it is designed to one day fly astronauts to @entity3 a test flight with crew aboard is set for 2021			1
@entity1 intends to use the rocket and @entity9 to fly astronauts to an asteroid that has been robotically relocated into a high orbit around the moon			2
@entity9 is being prepared for its first launch later this year , an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above @entity35 , in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space			1
after two orbits , @entity9 will reenter @entity35 â€™s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the @entity90			2
eventually , the @entity92 space agency wants to fly a four - member crew to @entity3			1
@entity1 has been out of the human space launch business since the shuttle program ended in 2011			0
the agency currently buys rides for space station crew members aboard @entity65 @entity101 capsules			2
a heated three - way competition to build a @entity92 - based commercial space taxi is also under way			0
the contenders are privately owned @entity106 , also known as @entity106 , privately owned @entity107 and @entity33			0
work on the @entity9 deep - space capsule , built by @entity32 , began more than a decade ago under @entity1 's defunct @entity110			2
@entity1 has already spent about $ 9 billion developing @entity9			0
@entity9 is part of @entity1 's follow - up program to the now - retiredspace shuttles that will allow astronauts to travel beyond @entity115 , which flies about 260 miles above @entity35 in june , the test version of @entity9 touched down safely in the @entity118 desert after being pulled out of a c - 17 aircraft , 35,000 feet above the @entity121 's @entity120			1
it was the first time some parachutes in the system had been tested at such a high altitude			0
engineers also put additional stresses on the parachutes by allowing the test version of @entity9 to free fall for 10 seconds , which increased the vehicle 's speed and aerodynamic pressure			0
after @entity9 's free fall , its forward bay cover parachutes deployed , pulling away the spacecraft 's forward bay cover , which is critical to the rest of the system performing as needed			0
the parachutes that slow @entity9 to a safe landing speed are located under the cover , so the cover must be jettisoned before they can be unfurled			0
the test also marked the last time the entire parachute sequence will be tested before @entity9 launches into space in december on its first space flight test , @entity147 - 1			2
during the flight , an uncrewed @entity9 will travel 3,600 miles into space , farther than any spacecraft built to carry humans has been in more than 40 years			1
a test flight with crew aboard is set for 2021 - eventually , the @entity92 space agency wants to fly a four - member crew to @entity3 the @entity9 crew module for exploration flight test - 1 going through final preparations			1
in december , @entity9 will launch 3,600 miles into space in a four - hour flight to test the systems that will be critical for survival in future human missions to deep space			1

an unmanned version of the @entity9 capsule has been under construction for three years at @entity5 in @entity6
it is due to launch aboard a @entity12 rocket on december 4 from nearby @entity13 in @entity6
in december , @entity9 will be flown to an altitude of 3,600 miles from @entity35 , 14 times farther away than the @entity36
a test flight with crew aboard is set for 2021 - eventually , the @entity92 space agency wants to fly a four - member crew to @entity3
