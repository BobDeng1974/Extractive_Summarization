we 've all sat in our armchairs or in the pub listening to pundits give their supposedly expert opinion on the day 's football and thought ' i could do better than that			2
' but these days it seems you need to be an ex-player to make your voice heard on the television or radio - upon retirement , they 're pretty much whisked out of their boots and sat straight in front of a camera or microphone			0
@entity20 , the man who brings joys and despair to millions in equal measure each weekend as the host of @entity26 ' @entity25 , is the glorious exception to this punditry rule			1
@entity20 is fronting the @entity30 campaign to find ' @entity31 ' where the prize on offer for a lucky fan is their big break on radio station @entity36 @entity20 is not an ex-pro , he 's a fan and a student of the game			1
his career is built on and continues to be fuelled by an obsession with football 's minutiae - searching out that elusive statistic that leaves the viewer astounded			2
on the face of it , following a rolling list of football results should not be appointment viewing			0
indeed , even for the most ardent football fan , it should be something of a turn off			0
after all , most of us truly care about only one team - our team			2
but for over two decades now , @entity20 has illuminated every saturday afternoon from august until may with his rare mix of warmth , charm , passion and inexhaustible knowledge			1
there simply is n’t anyone better to front the @entity30 ’s nationwide search to find @entity31 , a competition that will end with one armchair fan given their big break on the @entity36 radio station			1
and of course @entity20 , taking time out from his busy schedule of research and recording , is only too happy to pass on a few tips to the hopefuls			1
@entity20 chats to @entity79 's @entity78 ahead of the launch of the @entity81 ' @entity20 , 59 , has been presenting @entity26 's @entity25 programme every week for over two decades ‘ i was about six when i was taken to my first game - @entity83 of course , against @entity86 , ’ he says			1
‘ i think they won 2 - 0 and i thought it was glorious			0
then they did n’t win for the next 20 or so games i went to			0
‘ but by that point i was hooked			0
i read everything i could get my hands on - newspaper , books , programmes			0
in this job , i have spent hours searching for those elusive stats			2
‘ i used to get all the local newspapers delivered to my house and , when the kids were younger , would even have to escape for a few hours to @entity102 on the @entity103 to prep for the show			2
’ most of the copious notes @entity20 makes - and he does 90 per cent of the show ’s stats - are never used but , as we ’ve seen week - in , week - out for years now , when that obscure third division left - back does finally break his goal duck after 146 attempts , we will definitely know about it first			1
the beauty of @entity25 is that every team is treated with equal importance when @entity20 is treating us to the fruits of his week buried away amid the record books			1
@entity20 pictured on the @entity25 set during a @entity79 feature on the show back in 2012 with @entity122 on the set of @entity124 , which he presented between 2008 and 2011 this comes perhaps from his love for perennial - underachievers @entity83 - 92nd of the @entity128 clubs as we speak - and the circuitous route through local newspapers and radio stations that delivered @entity20 to where he is today			1
as well as soccer saturday , the 59 - year - old fronts @entity26 ’s @entity136 coverage and was the host of @entity124 ’s iconic countdown show between 2008 and 2011			1
but however glamorous the gig , the one constant over the years has been his insatiable passion for the greatest sport			0
‘ many pundits these days are ex-pros of course and i might not be able to tell you what ’s going on inside the dressing room , ’ he says			0
‘ but if you just have that passion and knowledge for the game , you can be just as insightful			0
’ ' if @entity30 did pundits …			2
they 'd probably be fans like you			0
the @entity30 and @entity36 have joined forces to give one fan their big break on national radio			1
@entity159 to @entity160 to enter now			0
