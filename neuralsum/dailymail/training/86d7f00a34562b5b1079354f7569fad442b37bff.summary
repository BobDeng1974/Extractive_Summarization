by @entity0 published : 21:18 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 21:18 est , 29 march 2013 tanning salons are routinely flouting regulations designed to protect customers against skin cancer , an investigation reveals			1
some are using sunbeds that emit rays four times above the legal limit of radiation			2
inspectors found more than 70 per cent of the sunbeds they tested were set above the limit , with compliance in one area standing at just 6 per cent			1
dangerous : many @entity18 salons are setting sunbeds too high to give their customers instant results it is thought many salons set the beds at a higher level in a bid to guarantee their customers an instant tan			1
in @entity18 , the legal limit for uv ray emissions is 0.3 watts per square metre – the equivalent of the midday sun in the southern @entity33			2
some of the sunbeds tested emitted up to 1.2 watts – a level which does not naturally occur anywhere on @entity38			1
experts warned that exposure to such emissions could multiply the risk of developing skin cancer			1
the findings were uncovered by @entity46 teams across the @entity18 in a crackdown on dangerous practices			0
@entity49 , an officer in @entity50 , said : ‘ the failures we have found are quite shocking			0
tests have been carried out up and down the country and found really low levels of compliance			0
risk : if anyone has been to a strong sunbed they should consult a gp , a trading standards officer said ‘ i do n’t think people realise the extent of the risk they are exposing themselves to			0
‘ we are talking about skin cancer – not a bit of sunburn			1
if anyone thinks they have been on a strong sunbed they should report it to us or consult their gp			0
’ the tests were carried out by inspectors wearing protective clothing while taking the readings with a radiation meter			0
the probe was launched after complaints from customers and tip - offs from other tanning operators that some were flouting the rules so they could provide quicker tans			2
tests on scores of sunbeds across @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity50 and @entity93 showed a worrying number were emitting 1.2 watts – four times the limit			1
the establishments causing most concern were dedicated tanning salons and operations linked to hairdressers and nail bars			1
in @entity93 , only 16 per cent of the 60 sunbeds tested complied with the regulations			1
skin cancer : @entity106 died after using sunbeds at an unsupervised coin - operated tanning salon in @entity110 @entity106 died from skin cancer after using sunbeds from the age of 16			1
the mother of three used coin - operated tanning booths for 20 minutes at a time , twice a week			2
although she stopped using them regularly when she got married at 22 , by 30 she had developed skin cancer			1
she died aged 39 after a nine - year fight against the disease , which saw her develop at least 19 tumours			0
speaking to the @entity120 in 2011 , mrs @entity106 said that she was never warned how strong the uv light was			0
she said : ‘ the sunbeds were unmanned , which meant there was no one there to advise me how long to go on for or how powerful the tubes were			2
i would insert my money into the machine and lie there for as long as i liked			0
‘ i often burnt my back and shoulders , but i thought that was the aim because the skin would later turn brown			2
’ the hotel manager , from @entity136 , @entity137 , said at the time : ‘ if i could turn back the clock , i would n’t have spent even one second on a sunbed			0
’ in @entity91 , where 85 beds were tested and only 6 per cent complied with the limits , nine beds were emitting 1.2 watts			1
a similar picture was emerging in @entity50 and @entity92 , where tests were being carried out this week			0
in @entity147 , 72 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet regulations , while in @entity149 80 per cent failed			1
@entity150 , chairman of @entity151 , said : ‘ we have been blazing the trail for 0.3 compliance right from the outset , training and working with @entity46 and @entity158 offices throughout the @entity18			0
‘ the picture is changing daily but more needs to be done			0
many local authorities are n’t testing compliance , and this must change			0
’ the legal limit across @entity164 is now 0.3 watts per square metre of tanning bed after it was reduced from 0.6 because of growing health concerns			2
a further reduction is on the cards because of fears that the current levels could still pose a skin cancer threat .			1
