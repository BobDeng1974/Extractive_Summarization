one of the deadliest mass shootings in @entity2 history will be replayed in a @entity4 courtroom — but only after an unprecedented jury pool of 9,000 people is winnowed to a handful to decide whether @entity8 was insane when he opened fire in a suburban movie theater			1
@entity8 is one of the few suspects to survive such an attack — many are killed by police or commit suicide			0
his survival has sparked an emotionally charged debate in which his parents have begged for a plea deal that would save his life , while many survivors and family members of victims have demanded that he stand trial and face the death penalty if convicted			1
jury selection begins tuesday , and the trial could run until october			1
it could provide a look into the mind of @entity8 , whose attorneys acknowledge was the gunman in the july 20 , 2012 , attack but say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode at the time			1
@entity37 201 : here , jury selection in the trial of @entity40 movie theater shootings defendant @entity8 is to begin tuesday at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity4 ' the public is going to get an insight into the mind of a killer who says he does n't know right from wrong , ' said @entity47 , a @entity48 - based jury consultant			1
' it is really rare			0
it just does n't usually come to this			0
' @entity8 , 27 , was arrested as he stripped off his combat gear in the parking lot of the @entity55 movie theater in @entity40 , where 12 people were killed and 70 injured during a midnight showing of a new @entity59 movie			1
he later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first - degree murder and attempted murder			0
if jurors find him guilty , they must then decide whether to recommend the death penalty			1
if @entity8 is found not guilty , he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital			0
under @entity4 law , defendants are not legally liable for their acts if their minds are so ' diseased ' that they can not distinguish right from wrong			1
part of the reason the case has dragged on so long is the battle over whether that standard applies to @entity8			0
few details on those arguments have been made public			0
prosecutors and defense attorneys remain under a long - running gag order , and court documents detailing the issue have stayed under seal			2
how the jury will be chosen : judge @entity87 called an unusually large number of people for jury duty , citing the difficulty in finding an unbiased panel			0
@entity87 expects it to take until may or june before he can find 12 jurors and 12 alternates			1
prosecutors will try to ensure jurors have no reservations about the death penalty while defense attorneys will look for those sympathetic to mental illness and uneasy with the idea of executing a person			1
on trial : @entity8 is accused of shooting dead 12 moviegoers and injuring 70 others in july 2012 @entity108 will be like : jurors wo n't be sequestered — isolated in a hotel — but will be allowed to go home every night			1
@entity87 will tell them they may not discuss the case with anyone , do any independent research on it , or watch , read or listen to news reports about it			0
their names wo n't be made public , and @entity87 has forbidden news organizations from taking their photos			0
three phases in @entity124 source : the @entity126 selection begins : as 9,000 prospective jurors are whittled down to just 24 , the men and women will be warned starting tuesday of the graphic police photos and other evidence they might be subjected to over the course of the trial @entity8 ' sanity was evaluated by a state psychiatrist but the results were not made public			1
prosecutors objected to the findings and persuaded a judge to order a second evaluation			0
those results were contested by the defense			0
prosecutors previously rejected at least one proposed plea deal made by attorneys for @entity8 , criticizing the lawyers for publicizing the offer and calling it a ploy to draw the public and judge into what should be private plea negotiations			0
survivors of the attack and family members of victims have had a long time to get ready for a trial			2
' we 've all been to therapists and have talked to our families and have our support groups , so we 're prepared , ' said @entity163 , who was shot in the arm and whose friend , @entity165 , died in the attack			0
' it 's gon na be quite the journey			2
' it could take until june to find 12 jurors and 12 alternates who were not biased by widespread news coverage of the shooting			1
insane ? jurors will have to decide both whether @entity8 is guilty and if he 's sane enough to answer for the crimes century 16 cinema in @entity40 , @entity4 jurors will see the majority of the gruesome photographs and video taken at the crime scene , but a handful of images will be barred , the judge overseeing the case ruled on tuesday			1
defense lawyers had argued the photos could prejudice the jury against @entity8 , who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity			0
but prosecutors countered that they were necessary to make their case against the @entity194 native , and @entity41 district court judge @entity195 rejected most of the defense 's motion in his ruling , saying images which depict the aftermath of crimes charges are allowed			2
' that many of the photographs will be difficult to view does not render them inadmissible , ' @entity87 wrote , adding that the same logic applied to the disturbing video footage recorded inside the cinema following the rampage			1
prosecutors have charged @entity8 with multiple counts of first - degree murder and attempted murder , and have said they will seek the death penalty for the one - time neuroscience doctoral candidate if he is convicted			1
the judge said he was ' disinclined ' to allow into evidence one photo showing a disemboweled woman , if the prosecution could provide a less graphic version			0
images of a bloody emergency room where victims were treated are likewise inadmissible , @entity87 ruled , because their value is ' substantially outweighed by the danger for unfair prejudice			0
' victims : six - year - old @entity225 , left , and 18 - year - old @entity226 , right , a popular musician and art student , were among the 12 people who lost their lives in the shooting last july photos and video taken inside @entity8 ' car that show a skull - shaped gearshift , and which the defense wanted barred , will be allowed because they depict part of the crime scene , he said , but prosecutors can not tell the jury the defendant 's choice of gearshift reflects any criminal intent			1
@entity87 did agree with defense lawyers who asked that a photo showing an undisclosed poster on the refrigerator in @entity8 ' apartment be cropped or blurred , saying the poster could offend some jurors			2
jury summonses were sent to 9,000 county residents this month , and jury selection is set to begin in january			2
@entity87 has told lawyers from both sides to prepare to make their opening statements in late may or early june			2
last week , @entity8 ' parents broke their silence over the killings , saying their son is mentally ill , ' not a monster , ' and should be spared the death penalty			1
scene : crosses , flowers and other mementos of the victims of the @entity40 movie theater shooting are shown with the movie theater in the background ready to fight : @entity41 , @entity4 district attorney @entity273 , left , walks with an unidentified man out of courtroom after a pre-trial readiness hearing equally challenging will be finding jurors who were not personally affected by the attack that sent waves of grief and anger through the @entity41 suburbs of @entity283			1
judge @entity87 called nearly nine times as many prospective jurors as were summoned in the ongoing @entity286 marathon bombing trial			2
that meant the county 's 600,000 residents had a nearly one - in - 50 chance of being selected			2
among those summoned were at least 13 people who were either witnesses to the attack or have family members who work in the prosecutor 's office			2
starting tuesday , prospective jurors will report in groups of about 250 to fill out a long questionnaire that has n't been made public			2
those who are n't excluded because of their answers will be called back for individual questioning			1
potential jurors wo n't be allowed to read or talk about the case until they know they 've been dismissed			0
that will be difficult in the era of social media , since they have no control over what pops up on their @entity309 or @entity310 feeds			0
the final panel wo n't be sequestered			0
during the selection process , @entity8 ' attorneys will focus on picking jurors who are morally opposed to capital punishment , even as prosecutors fight to ensure those on the panel are ' death - penalty eligible , ' meaning they would be open to executing @entity8			1
' it is really stacked against the defense , ' said @entity321 , managing partner of the @entity322 , a @entity194 - based trial consulting firm			0
' here , you have a horrific crime occurring in a public setting where you think people would be safe			0
... because of the heinous nature of the crime and the number of victims , i can see people who would say , ' in most instances i could not support the death penalty , and in this case , i can			1
'' enduring the trial from the jury box would seem more difficult than the selection process			1
' this is going to be a life - changing event for every juror who sits on the trial , ' @entity321 said			0
' they are going to deal with life - and - death issues that will forever be part of their experience			0
' members of the the prosecution team from the @entity41 district attorney 's office leave the @entity55 theater after spending more than an hour there in 2012			2

selection begins tuesday in @entity4 in trial over one of @entity2 's worst ever mass shootings that left 12 dead and 70 injured in july 2012
the hot button issue of the death penalty *paired* with the @entity40 's lingering scars from the murders have *prompted* the mass search for jurors
jurors will be rigorously screened first through questionnaires then through individual questioning that will whittle them to 100 or so
group questioning will follow to get down to just 12 jurors and 12 alternates *--* a process that will take until may or june
jurors will be warned that they *'ll* see the majority of the gruesome photographs and video taken at the crime scene
