there is a digital clock in the foyer of the old @entity4 offices on @entity5 that is counting down to the beginning of the @entity7			0
as @entity9 walked out to play @entity10 yesterday evening , it said there were 180 days to go			1
everything @entity9 do in this @entity13 is being seen through the prism of their prospects in the tournament which will start here at @entity19 on september 18 with their opener against @entity22			1
when @entity25 ’s side failed their biggest test of this competition , slumping to a shattering 19 - 9 loss to @entity29 at the @entity30 a fortnight ago , many observers said the rest of the @entity13 was redundant for them			1
@entity34 wing @entity32 crosses over to score @entity9 's third try and send them top of the @entity13 table @entity39 hands off a tackle as @entity9 recovered from a half - time deficit to win at @entity19 @entity42 : @entity9 v @entity10 match review they said that the match against @entity29 was the only game that could tell us whether @entity9 were making significant progress in the build - up to the @entity7 and nothing that happened in their last two games against @entity53 or @entity10 mattered			1
they were damned for the manner of their defeat , of course			0
unflattering comparisons were drawn with where this side stands six months before the @entity7 to the level @entity63 ’s side had reached at the same stage prior to the 2003 tournament			0
‘ based on their performances in the @entity13 , @entity9 are running the risk of being labelled the most foolish team in the competition , ’ @entity9 @entity7 winner @entity66 wrote			1
‘ @entity9 need to play with tempo , yes , but they need to do it with their rugby brains fully engaged and that is not what they have been doing at key moments			2
’ @entity9 won the game but they have n't shown enough to convince yet during the @entity13 @entity81 was one of the better performers but @entity9 spurned too many opportunities at @entity19 despite the predictions , though , saturday 's battle for the @entity85 told us plenty about @entity9 ’s prospects in the autumn			1
it was n’t all good by any means			0
in fact , the evidence of an exhilarating first half suggested again that @entity9 are still short of the standard they have to achieve to be realistic contenders for the @entity7			2
it felt like a wasted opportunity			0
despite concerns that the match had not sold out , the atmosphere at @entity19 had been bolstered by the scenes playing on the screens inside and outside the stadium from @entity104 where @entity106 ’ victory over @entity29 put @entity9 back in with a chance of winning the @entity13			1
when @entity9 tore @entity10 apart in the opening minutes , it felt as if this could yet be the game that ignited their confidence and laid the foundation for future success			1
that feeling did not last for long			0
@entity115 got @entity9 off to a perfect start in the second - half but the first half will have worried them the @entity9 squad smile for the cameras having defeated @entity10 25 - 13 to win the @entity85 defeating @entity10 however will not lead the top nations to fear @entity9 , and time is running out @entity9 were not ruthless enough in attack			1
they squandered chance after chance to convert breakaways , eschewing easy passes , making the wrong decisions			0
they should have scored four tries before half - time but they were limited to @entity135 ’s score after a neat sidestep five minutes into the game			0
it seemed then as if @entity9 were about to embark on the points rampage that would put them in prime position ahead of the final fixtures of the competition next weekend			2
that rampage did not materialise			0
instead , @entity10 came back into the game and more doubts began to surface about @entity9			1
this time , it was their defence which suffered in comparison to the heroic efforts of the @entity151 earlier in the day			0
@entity152 bulldozed his way over for a score with @entity10 ’s first chance of the game midway through the half			2
@entity19 may still be a formidable place to get a result , but @entity9 are not unbeatable there @entity159 ( centre ) leads an @entity9 breakaway as @entity163 's side returned to the @entity13 summit @entity9 allowed @entity10 back into the game too easily , and they lack momentum heading to the @entity7 @entity10 actually led 13 - 10 at the interval			1
their supporters began to dream of a first victory at @entity19 for 32 years			0
it was hardly the response to the defeat in @entity175 that @entity25 was looking for			2
‘ @entity9 need to be careful out there or they could end up with real egg on their face , ’ @entity63 said at half - time			2
@entity9 banished that idea when @entity115 burst over for a try three minutes into the second half but , even though @entity10 never threatened again , @entity9 remained unconvincing			1
there were times when they seemed to be trying to set a new record for ways in which they could ruin their good work			0
@entity191 runs clear but @entity9 repeatedly failed to take their chances at @entity19 on saturday twice they had tries ruled out for forward passes			1
a late score in the corner from @entity32 put a healthier gloss on the result but they will only take a four - point advantage over @entity29 into the deciding weekend			2
it should have been more and when the final whistle went , it was met only by lukewarm applause			0
sure , @entity9 may yet win the @entity13 next saturday but the truth is that there is no sense of momentum about their build - up to the @entity7			1
there are moments when they excite , certainly , but there are times when they bewilder , too			0
the suspicion remains that even here at @entity19 , the best in the world will be too much for them in the autumn			2
and all the time , that clock in the old @entity4 headquarters keeps on counting down .			0

@entity9 beat @entity10 25 - 13 at @entity19 but missed several chances
the biggest test for @entity25 's side came in defeat by @entity29
but even after *setback* , @entity9 had chance to lay down a *marker*
even if @entity9 win @entity13 , they will not take momentum into autumn
top teams will still feel @entity9 are beatable , even at @entity19
