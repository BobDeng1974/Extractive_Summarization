the @entity0 will investigate @entity3 manager @entity2 ' latest outburst against referees following tuesday night 's defeat to @entity6 in the @entity7			1
the 2 - 1 first leg loss was @entity3 's third defeat in a week - the first time this has happened since 1992 - and @entity2 claimed afterwards his team are ' playing referees as well as the opposition			1
' it follows on from @entity2 saying it was ' scandalous ' that @entity3 were not awarded a late penalty against @entity17 in a league defeat at @entity19 on @entity20			1
an @entity0 spokesman said : ' we are looking into @entity2 ' comments to the media following the match at @entity6			1
a referee can over-rule his assistant but given the relative positions of the two officials that was not credible			2
although @entity34 ’s contact was at most minimal , it was a silly challenge in a critical area and that forced @entity33 to make a decision			2
perhaps it was harsh but @entity3 ’s reaction was over the top , with @entity50 shouting at @entity30 and @entity51 picking up a yellow card for his protest			1
the @entity54 might well have seen red minutes later when making a rash tackle but @entity30 wisely decided that the two offences did not merit a dismissal and left @entity3 with 11 players			1
after @entity60 's penalty consigned @entity3 to another defeat , @entity2 said : ' after the first 15 minutes i thought we were very good			1
we defended a terrible free - kick , but how the referee has given a free - kick for that is way beyond me			0
' i just can not see how that is a free - kick			0
' and the penalty ? we had a player booked for that theother day against @entity17			1
the referee is in a great position to look at it , down the line , 15 yards , and the linesman gives it from behind and he can not see through @entity77			0
‘ that is what we ’re finding at the moment			0
the performance was good without having the last bit			0
‘ i have experience and i can sense it ’s on the verge of turning			0
i sense we ’re about to get a bit better			0
’ more than 5,000 @entity3 supporters were in the 31,547 crowd and @entity2 paid tribute to them and @entity90 , who left the @entity91 through the press room carrying a bottle of red wine			1
@entity2 added : ‘ i can only see @entity95 as a great sounding board , a great help , and so is sir @entity98 , he is terrific			1
@entity99 is at the training ground regularly			0
spot of bother : @entity34 brings down @entity35 and concedes a penalty making the call : referee @entity30 points to the penalty spot not impressed : @entity77 argues with referee @entity30 ‘ it ’s great 5,000 came up tonight and they were fantastic throughout the game			2
they recognised how well their team had done for most of the game			0
‘ this has n’t happened at @entity3 for a long time			1
i thought the support were great for sticking with their club , sticking with their manager and that is exactly what you need when you are not doing so well			0
‘ we need a couple of fair decisions			0
we had a couple of penalty kicks against @entity17 and we have one given against us tonight for that			1
my goodness , give me strength			0
’ @entity2 will hope to have strikers @entity129 and @entity131 fit for the second leg			1
not going to plan : @entity3 defender @entity134 looks dejected as his side lost for the third time in a week all going wrong : @entity50 gave @entity6 the lead with an own goal but there is more concern for the manager with @entity3 captain @entity134 set to leave @entity19 this summer after his agent said he is unlikely to sign a new contract			1
@entity134 ’s four - year deal runs out at the end of the season and talks over a new one have stalled , with @entity150 clubs @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 monitoring the situation			0
his agent @entity155 said : ‘ at the moment , i would rule out an extension with @entity3			2
@entity134 , given his contract situation , has several teams looking at him			0
’ not going to plan : @entity163 and @entity3 struggled at the @entity91 tuesday night ’s win for @entity6 was their first over @entity3 for 20 games			1
and manager @entity166 , whose side are bottom of the league , was at a loss to explain their excellent cup form			2
he said : ‘ it is something i need to find out why we beat top teams and are so clinical in the cup and ca n’t do the same in the league			0
‘ are we favourites ? no chance			2
they have @entity129 and @entity131 to come back			0
we are in a better situation but playing @entity3 away , anything can happen and we need another very good performance			2

@entity3 suffer third defeat in a week after losing to @entity17 and @entity187
@entity2 rages at penalty decision as @entity6 win first leg
despite win @entity6 boss @entity166 says @entity3 are favourites to *progress*
