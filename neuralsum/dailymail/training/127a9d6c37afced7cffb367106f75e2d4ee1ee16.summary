by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 walked into @entity5 ’s press auditorium , looking completely deflated			1
after a summer of turmoil on the @entity7 , he had to fulfil the duty — explaining a @entity10 defeat — which many would have expected after his first game in charge			1
his deflation , though , had nothing to do with the hand that he had been dealt			0
there was no complaint about his club ’s board or the absence of those influential former players who were sold for a king ’s ransom this summer			0
no. @entity3 was miserable because his team had to make the long journey home with nothing to show for their impressive efforts ; their performance , full of spirit and tenacity , rattled a disjointed @entity34 and should have yielded at least a point			1
@entity3 , however , does not subscribe to the opinion that relegation is a certainty — ‘ have a bet with me about that and you will lose , ’ he said before this trip to @entity63 — and nor should he on the basis of this effort			1
‘ always there is one end to all of those stories , ’ said @entity3 , as he reflected on the sucker - punch goal from @entity68 that clinched @entity34 ’s victory			1
‘ it is between the white lines of the pitch to show the people and , first , to show ourselves that we have to believe in our quality			0
energetic : @entity79 impressed for @entity10 at left - back , making up for @entity82 's departure ‘ that was one of the messages we gave the boys			0
we played an impressive second half and that is how we like to play			1
if we play like that , i do n’t think we will struggle			0
the way we played ( against @entity34 ) i think brings us a lot of confidence			1
if it took them a while to find their stride , @entity10 regularly began causing @entity34 headaches			2
all over the pitch , figures in dark blue caught the eye , from @entity103 , the best central defender on the pitch , to the terrific @entity43			2
in midfield @entity106 darted into dangerous areas and delivered a stream of impressive dead balls , @entity105 was figure of muscular aggression , while @entity113 showed enough flair to suggest that , at £ 10.9million , he could become a key figure			0
talented : @entity113 was instrumental for @entity10 on his debut , setting up their only goal yet all those positives could not mask @entity3 ’s feelings			2
he had been at @entity5 seven days earlier , along with his assistant @entity120 , to see @entity34 pummel @entity121 4 - 0 but he had done his homework and it so nearly paid off			1
‘ we were unlucky but the final score makes the points , ’ @entity3 reflected			2
‘ at 1 - 1 one team on the pitch was playing and it was @entity10			1
we had a chance to score the second , two great opportunities , but the quality of @entity34 … that makes the difference			2
’ it was , ultimately , small details			0
if @entity137 had not diverted @entity140 ’s thumping 88th minute drive on the bar , @entity3 ’s belief would have been vindicated			0
as it is , he will have to wait for saturday ’s home date with @entity144 to show why he has such faith			0
video new signings excellent - @entity147			0

@entity3 lost his first game in charge 1 - 0 at @entity5 against @entity34
@entity43 scored between @entity151 and @entity68 goals
@entity3 was very *disappointed* with the result , *claiming* his side played the majority of the football in the second - half
