midwives have been given the green light to take the main role in performing abortions			1
new @entity5 rules say for the first time that midwives and nurses may ‘ participate in the termination ’			1
the controversial guidelines were last night condemned by mps and anti-abortion campaigners			0
@entity13 said : ‘ it is particularly perverse that midwives , who do the beautiful work of helping babies into the world , will now be called upon to end the lives of children they might otherwise work to save			1
’ @entity22 role : new @entity5 rules say for the first time that midwives and nurses may ' participate in the termination ' ( file picture ) @entity27 mp @entity26 said the new rules would ‘ allow abortions to be administered by nurses or midwives instead of doctors ’			1
she added : ‘ this is a clear liberalisation of abortion law which people do not want			1
moreover , i do not believe that it is what @entity37 intended			0
’ under previous guidelines , midwives and nurses could undertake ‘ certain actions ’ in helping to terminate unwanted pregnancies			2
' @entity43 ' : @entity27 mp @entity26 said the new rules would ' allow abortions to be administered by nurses or midwives instead of doctors ' but the new rules go much further and state clearly that a ‘ nurse or midwife may administer the drugs used for medical abortions ’			1
the new guidance , which also rules out abortions carried out on the grounds of the sex alone , comes at a time of controversy over abortion law , which allows nearly 200,000 terminations to be performed in @entity61 and @entity62 each year			1
about a fifth of pregnancies end in abortion			2
the 1967 law which governs abortion says that two doctors must approve the termination and the procedure must be conducted by a doctor			1
in 1981 , the courts gave approval for nurses to be involved , and @entity76 guidance restated the principle in 1999			0
but the new rules for the first time say that a doctor needs only to approve and begin a termination			2
the bulk of the procedure can be carried out by nurses			0
the move follows pressure from the @entity87 and abortion providers , who believe the law should be changed to allow nurses full control of abortion induced by drugs or some other techniques			1
@entity97 mp @entity96 , the co-chairman of the all - party @entity98 , said : ‘ we simply can not trust the @entity5 on abortion			2
‘ they take every opportunity to make life easier for the abortion industry , even on legally contentious grounds			0
@entity101 is crystal clear that a qualified doctor is the only person able to perform an abortion			2

under previous guidelines , midwives and nurses could undertake ' certain actions ' in helping to terminate unwanted pregnancies ‘ not satisfied with this , the department is now making nurses and midwives accomplices to the tragic taking of innocent human life			0
we are looking at a judicial review to challenge the legality of this appalling decision			0
’ pro-choice organisations say that over the past 20 years nurses have taken over many of the clinical functions once reserved for doctors and so the law should be liberalised to allow them to take over the lead role in abortion			2
' this is a clear liberalisation of abortion law which people do not want			1
moreover , i do not believe that it is what @entity37 intended ' @entity26 , conservative mp @entity143 , chief executive of the biggest abortion provider , @entity144 , said : ‘ we think nurses are the best people to deliver early abortions			1
abortions should be carried out by people who are clinically qualified to do it , including nurses			2
’ the @entity5 said the new guidelines made no difference to the law and merely clarified the existing rules			0
dr @entity156 , a consultant psychologist and critic of abortion law , believes the new guidance is designed to free up funds in the @entity161			1
‘ nurses would be cheaper than doctors , ’ he said			0
‘ one can see that from a purely economic point of view , the government is moving in that direction			0
’ dr @entity169 , chairman of the @entity170 , added : ‘ midwifery is one of the most life - enhancing fields in the whole of medicine and to ask midwives to carry out these death sentences is obscene			0
it is a betrayal of what midwives are for			0

new rules state midwives and nurses may ' participate in the termination '
they say nurse / midwife ' may administer drugs used for medical abortions '
lord @entity13 : ' midwives will end lives of children they might otherwise save '
mp @entity26 : ' a clear liberalisation of abortion law people do not want '
