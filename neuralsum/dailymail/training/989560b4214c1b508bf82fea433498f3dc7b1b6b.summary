by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:29 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 14 march 2013 the architect of @entity6 ’s @entity5 ’s operating system , @entity7 , is stepping down unexpectedly after a seven - year stint in the job			1
the surprise change was announced by @entity6 on wednesday and could raise new questions about @entity5 ’s direction as @entity6 competes with @entity13 , @entity14 , and other tech companies rushing to gain ground in the lucrative mobile computing market			0
in his place , @entity6 has appointed @entity20 , the executive overseeing its @entity22 web browser and applications like @entity24 and @entity25 , to take over @entity7 's spot			1
stepping down : @entity6 announced wednesday that the architect of its @entity5 , @entity7 , is leaving after seven years those in the tech industry and beyond have speculated that the move is significant in part because it could mean @entity22 ’s operating system could replace the @entity5 os. in a blog post , @entity34 , @entity6 's chief executive and co-founder , credited @entity7 , 50 , for evangelizing @entity5 several years ago and building it into a free , open - source platform that runs on nearly three - quarters of the world 's smartphones and is used by the world 's largest handset manufacturers , from @entity43 to @entity44 ' having exceeded even the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for @entity5 — and with a really strong leadership team in place — @entity7 's decided it 's time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at @entity6 , ' @entity34 wrote			1
' @entity7 , more moonshots please ! the merger of the @entity22 and @entity5 divisions helps resolve a longstanding tension in the @entity58 , @entity59 - based company 's corporate strategy , and reflects a convergence of mobile and desktop software			1
the tech giant ’s stocks fell by $ 2.30 on wednesday , closing at $ 825.31			0
when @entity6 poured resources into launching the @entity22 web browser five years ago , the company laid out a vision of the @entity68 and an ecosystem of @entity6 apps based on the @entity71			1
moving up : @entity20 , the senior vice president of @entity22 , will take @entity7 's place but the @entity5 operating system , acquired by @entity6 in 2005 , has also been a runaway success , enabling third - party handset makers like @entity43 to overtake @entity13 while also spawning a massive economy of third - party apps that are only loosely affiliated with @entity6			1
under @entity20 's direction , @entity6 has released several netbook computers using the @entity22 operating system			1
last month , when @entity20 unveiled the @entity83 , the first @entity22 - based laptop with a touch - screen interface , analysts noted that @entity22 and @entity5 appeared to be on converging paths			1
' you had this @entity88 and this @entity89 that were building in many overlapping products , ' said @entity91 , an analyst at @entity92			0
praise : @entity34 , @entity6 's chief executive and co-founder , credited @entity7 for evangelizing @entity5 several years ago and building it into a free , open - source platform @entity91 argued that despite @entity5 's overwhelming popularity , it is @entity22 that remains at the core of @entity6 's strategy			1
' for @entity6 , it 's not about the platform , but the ecosystem , ' @entity91 said			0
' they 're more concerned long - term about @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , and less about helping @entity43 sell more phones			1
' chrome , @entity91 added , ' is the purest expression of @entity6 's philosophy			0
' page was quiet on @entity7 's future role			2
some analysts speculated that @entity7 , an executive with a knack for developing products , could take on one of the company 's many budding projects such as its @entity120 eyewear or the self - driving car			2
' if he really has the magic touch perhaps he can create something else within @entity6 , ' said @entity124 , an analyst at @entity125 , who added that it was better for @entity6 to have a more ' cohesive ' mobile brand			0
still , it remains unclear how @entity20 would seek to merge @entity22 and @entity5 , if at all			1
@entity14 , for example , recently introduced its @entity130 operating system that was designed for both touch - screen desktop devices and @entity133 smartphones like the @entity134 , while its surface tablet further blurred the distinctions between form factors			0
in his blog post , @entity34 said @entity20 would ' double down ' on @entity5			2
' @entity139 has a talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use — and he loves a big bet , ' @entity34 wrote			0
' so while @entity7 's a really hard act to follow , i know @entity145 will do a tremendous job doubling down on @entity5 as we work to push the ecosystem forward			2
' @entity5 is now installed on roughly two - thirds of the world 's smartphones , supplanting @entity13 at the pinnacle of the fast - moving mobile arena			0
uncertainty : some have questioned the future of the @entity5 @entity5 tablets are also expected to overtake @entity13 's @entity158 in terms of shipments in 2013 , it research house @entity156 predicted on tuesday			0
but @entity5 's explosive growth - and the companies it has boosted - have also concerned @entity6 's leadership			0
@entity7 himself has warned other @entity6 executives that @entity43 could use its heft to renegotiate its ad revenue - sharing deals with @entity6 , the @entity164 reported last month			1
the re-shuffle reinforces @entity20 , a senior vice president , as one of the leading voices within @entity173 as an engineer in @entity175 before moving to the @entity176 , @entity20 holds degrees from @entity178 and the @entity180 's @entity179			2
he joined @entity6 in 2004			0
in 2008 , @entity20 aggressively pushed @entity6 's @entity22 , when @entity14 's explorer lorded over the market			1
@entity22 now commands a roughly 35 percent market share according to web traffic analyzers @entity185			2
he is also credited with the development of some of the company 's most successful cloud - based apps , such as @entity190 and @entity25 , and has also steered @entity24			2
