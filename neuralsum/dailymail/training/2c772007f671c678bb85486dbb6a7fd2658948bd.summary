voicing her concerns : @entity2 is urging a major overhaul of sexual education classes in public schools so that the information is more focused on actual needs of students a top academic has called for massive changes in the sex ed system so that rather than simply being told not to get pregnant , young girls should have discussions about how early their fertility rates begin to drop and when they should start trying to have children			1
@entity2 , who is best known for her 1990 book @entity16 , made the bold declaration because she says the current curriculum is so focused on preventing pregnancy and ' abstinence only ' education that it may hinder would - be mothers later in life			1
' sobering facts about women ’s declining fertility after their 20s are being withheld from ambitious young women , who are propelled along a career track devised for men , ' ms @entity2 wrote in an op - ed for @entity34			1
this is an idea she feels passionate about , saying teachers and parents should force their daughters to think about the larger picture of their life rather than just the present			0
' i want every 14 - year - old girl ... to be told : you better start thinking what do you want in life			0
if you just want a career and no children you do n't have much to worry about , ' she said in a december @entity51 interview			2
' if , however , you are thinking you 'd like to have children some day you should start thinking about when do you want to have them			0
early or late ? to have them early means you are going to make a career sacrifice , but you 're going to have more energy and less risks			0
both the pros and the cons should be presented			0
' she goes on to explain that informing young girls about the rates at which fertility rates will drop off in their late 20s should not be taken as a seal of approval for teenage sex			1
separating the sexes : @entity2 argues that boys and girls need to be taught different things in the classes and it is ' absurd ' to address their concerns in the same setting , citing issues like date rape and fertility ' my generation of baby - boom girls boldly rebelled against the cult of virginity of the @entity83 1950s , but we left chaos in our wake			1
young people are now bombarded prematurely with sexual images and messages , ' ms @entity2 wrote in @entity34			2
she announced that girls and boys have to be separated during sexual education courses because it is ' absurd ' to pretend that the sexes deal with the issue in the same way			1
big ideas : @entity2 made her mark on the academic world with her 1990 tome that analyzed the history of gender dynamics ' boys need lessons in basic ethics and moral reasoning about sex ( for example , not taking advantage of intoxicated dates ) , while girls must learn to distinguish sexual compliance from popularity , ' she said			1
ms @entity2 , 66 , has described herself as a ' contrarian ' whose work has focused largely on sexual gender dynamics			1
she writes that the morality issues that are so intrinsically linked to sex ed by politicians needs to be taken out of schools and that the classes need to be taught as impartially - almost clinically - as possible			2
' the liberal response to conservatives ’ demand for abstinence - only sex education has been to condemn the imposition of “ fear and shame ” on young people			2
but perhaps a bit more self - preserving fear and shame might be helpful in today ’s hedonistic , media - saturated environment , ' ms @entity2 writes			0
among the suggestions she pushes for are the removal of condoms from schools , the inclusion of menopause in biology class curriculum , and the ban on any perceived endorsement of homosexual relationships by sex ed teachers			1
' in my view , antibullying campaigns , however laudable , should not stray into political endorsement of homosexuality or gay rights causes			0
while students must be free to create gay - identified groups , the schools themselves should remain neutral and allow society to evolve on its own , ' she writes			0
ms @entity2 was in a relationship with a female artist for more than a decade and legally adopted her partner 's son in 2002			0
the couple split in 2007 .			0

@entity2 , one of the leading academics in gender and sexual dynamics , has revealed that sex ed should not be focused on preventing pregnancies
says that young girls need to be *aware* of fertility rates so that they can plan whether or not they want to focus on their career or family early on
classes are currently focused on teaching children how not to get pregnant without any discussion of when they should try
calls co-ed sexual education classes ' absurd '
believes biology classes should be *tasked* with explaining *reproductive* process as well as *puberty* and menopause
