the prince , nicknamed @entity15 for his habit of taking long - haul flights at the public 's expense , is currently on the final leg of a three - week , 21,258 - mile ‘ official ’ trip			1
he took @entity6 , 23 , who has moved to the city to work for a year for an online auction company , out for dinner at @entity25 on wednesday night			0
the palace has insisted that his primary reason for being in @entity7 was to attend a @entity28 , sailors , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity33 ball			2
the @entity35 ’s son , 53 , was forced to give up his formal role as a @entity38 trade ambassador after a string of scandals			0
he is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise his foreign travel in advance			0
a spokesman for the @entity45 told the @entity46 : ' their schedules worked so they were both able to be there at the time @entity6 was moving to @entity7			2
' if the @entity49 was there at the same time it would have have been because he wanted to be there when his daughter was moving away for a year			0
' the @entity3 had four days of official engagements while visiting @entity55 and @entity56 , but also managed a further eight days designated ' private time '			1
the first leg of his tour of the @entity61 was funded in full by taxpayers , @entity58 admitted last night			1
a one - way - business class ticket would cost at least £ 5,000			0
in both @entity69 and @entity7 his expenses – including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of ‘ @entity75 ’ , the @entity64 has learnt			1
founded in 1831 by the @entity49 , the @entity76 is a respected independent , not - for - profit research body offering expert opinion on defence , security and terrorism			1
a @entity58 spokesman insisted the remaining cost of the trip were paid for by the @entity85			1
the @entity86 declined to comment on his meeting with @entity6 describing it as a ' personal matter '			0
' @entity90 : the @entity35 's son , 53 , was forced to give up his formal role as a @entity38 trade ambassador after a string of scandals @entity3 flew out of the @entity38 – accompanied by a team of round - the - clock , publicly - funded police bodyguards – on september 16 to @entity99 , where he stayed for three days			1
the visit was , apparently , designed to promote ‘ @entity38 bilateral relations including in trade and investment , science and innovation as well as education ’			0
he attended a dinner at the @entity108 , opened the new @entity38 embassy and attended a launch of a government - backed tourism initiative			0
@entity58 officials confirmed last night that this leg of his journey was approved by the @entity116 at the request of the @entity118 , which means that all his travel costs , hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the @entity35 ’s @entity124			1
one - way business class flights to @entity99 are just under £ 5,000			0
his last official engagement was on the evening of september 19 , after which @entity3 disappeared for a three - day weekend			1
he then reappeared in the @entity56 capital @entity129 on september 23 for a two - day stay			0
most notable in a series of engagements , was a high - level @entity76 conference discussing @entity38 - @entity56 defence co-operation and strategic issues in @entity137			2
palace officials say the prince covered the cost of this part of his trip personally			2
duties : the prince attends the @entity28 ' , @entity145 ' , @entity30 ' , @entity31 & @entity147 's @entity146 in @entity7 last night @entity58 has insisted that the stay in @entity7 was paid for by an @entity150 private defence think tank and the prince himself his final engagement was on september 24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again for five days			1
again , palace officials have declined to discuss his movements			0
@entity3 then turned up in @entity69 on monday this week for another public , yet privately - funded , series of engagements			1
the main thrust of the prince ’s visit was to attend a @entity76 conference on @entity38 - @entity169 security co-operation , where he shared the stage with sir @entity171 , former director of the @entity173 ( @entity174 ) , and @entity169 premier , @entity175			1
@entity169 is looking to spend billions on its defence as tensions rise with @entity178 and pressure comes from the @entity150 for the country to become more pro-active globally			0
as a result huge defence contracts are up for grabs			0
according to well - placed sources , the prince also took the opportunity to spend some time privately with the @entity169 royal family			0
after initially refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there , @entity58 eventually admitted – after being challenged by the @entity64 – that @entity76 had ‘ made a proportionate contribution towards his costs ’			1
the think - tank also funded him to fly on to @entity7 on wednesday this week , ostensibly to take part in further high - level discussions on its behalf			1
scrutiny : the prince is the only member of the @entity201 who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance a spokesman for the prince said he was a ‘ great admirer of the @entity76 ’s work ’			1
sources stressed @entity3 did not receive a salary as a member of its @entity211 and pointed out it ‘ already has well - established links with the @entity201 , in the form of the @entity35 , who is its patron , and the @entity215 , its president ’			2
a spokesman for @entity76 said they had been keen to invite @entity3 to join their advisory board as he ‘ endorsed and consolidated @entity76 ’s status as a leading independent international think tank ’			1
however the latest revelations will , once again , shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities			0
in 2001 he became the @entity38 ’s @entity225			0
but he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers ’ money			0
the final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with @entity232 , a @entity150 financier who has been jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls			0
in july 2011 @entity3 announced he was standing down			2
@entity236 of the @entity237 ’ @entity235 , said : ‘ taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the @entity3 ’s gallivanting across the globe , given that he is no longer a @entity38 trade envoy			2
it is imperative that the @entity3 is open and transparent about exactly how he has spent taxpayers ’ cash			2

think tank @entity76 subsidised @entity3 's expenses
@entity58 insists the rest of @entity7 stay was paid by the prince himself
