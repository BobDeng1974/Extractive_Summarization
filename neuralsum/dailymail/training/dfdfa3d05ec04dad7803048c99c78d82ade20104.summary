@entity1 police officers have urged lawmakers to keep an exemption in state law that allows undercover officers to have sex with prostitutes during investigations , touching off a heated debate			1
authorities say they need the legal protection to catch lawbreakers in the act			2
critics , including human trafficking experts and other police , say it 's unnecessary and could further victimize sex workers , many of whom have been forced into the trade			1
police have n't said how often - or even if - they use the provision			0
and when they asked legislators to preserve it , they made assurances that internal policies and procedures are in place to prevent officers from taking advantage of it			0
@entity36 police have urged lawmakers to allow them to legally use prostitutes claiming that it is important for undercover police work ( stock image ) but expert @entity42 says the exemption is ' antiquated at best ' and that police can easily do without it			1
' it does n't help your case , and at worst you further traumatize someone			0
and do you think he or she is going to trust a cop again ? ' asked @entity42 , who trains @entity54 police in best practices on human trafficking cases and twice has testified to @entity57 about the issue			1
a @entity36 bill cracking down on prostitution ( @entity61 1926 ) was originally written to scrap the sex exemption for officers on duty			1
it was amended to restore that protection after police testimony			1
the revised proposal passed the @entity70 and will go before a @entity72 committee on friday			0
it 's not immediately clear whether similar provisions are in place elsewhere as state law or department policy			0
but advocates were shocked that @entity36 exempts police from its prostitution laws , suggesting it 's an invitation for misconduct			1
' police abuse is part of the life of prostitution , ' said @entity87 , the executive director of the @entity89 - based group @entity88			2
@entity90 said that in places without such police protections ' women who have escaped prostitution ' commonly report being coerced into giving police sexual favors to keep from being arrested			2
the @entity36 bill aims to ratchet up penalties on johns and pimps			1
selling sex would remain a petty misdemeanor			0
during recent testimony , @entity1 police said the sex exemption protects investigations and should remain in place			1
as @entity36 lawmakers considered a measure that would crack down on prostitution , the @entity108 requested for it to remain legal for undercover officers to have sex with prostitutes ' the procedures and conduct of the undercover officers are regulated by department rules , which by nature have to be confidential , ' @entity115 maj. @entity114 told the @entity121			1
' because if prostitution suspects , pimps and other people are privy to that information , they 're going to know exactly how far the undercover officer can and can not go			0
' democratic state rep. @entity128 , the committee chairman , said police testimony convinced him to amend the proposal			1
' it 's a really murky area , ' said @entity128 , who represents a district that includes @entity1 's @entity136 , a longstanding epicenter of street prostitution			2
' i was reluctant to interfere in something that they face all the time			0
if they think it 's necessary to not have it in the statute , this is one area where i did defer to them and say , '' i hope you 're not having sex with prostitutes			2
'' ' critics say the police perspective is off base			2
@entity155 , a former prosecuting attorney who runs the global trafficking program of the women 's advocacy group @entity157 , said the risk of re-victimizing a sex worker , who may already have been trafficked , should make sex during an investigation off - limits			1
' i can understand you 're in a drug den , and you have a gun to your head and someone says '' snort this , '' ' @entity155 said , acknowledging the gray areas associated with undercover police work			0
but the sex exemption in @entity36 is ' so dissimilar from that circumstance on so many levels '			1
there have been instances of police being accused of victimizing sex workers across the nation			1
in @entity181 , a former officer is on trial facing charges of raping two prostitutes after forcing them at gunpoint to take narcotics			0
a former @entity187 , @entity54 , officer is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of raping prostitutes in his police cruiser while on patrol			0
and last year in @entity193 , a former police officer pleaded guilty to extorting sex from prostitutes he threatened with arrest			2
@entity36 state rep. @entity128 listens during a @entity70 floor session at the @entity199 in @entity1 on march 19 @entity128 said he knew no reason to suspect @entity1 police are out of line			1
' all allegations of misconduct are investigated and the appropriate disciplinary action taken , ' said @entity206 , @entity1 police spokeswoman , in an email			0
it 's not clear , however , what the punishment would be			0
the disclosure laws for police misconduct in @entity36 make it impossible to know if an on - duty officer had faced discipline or accusations of having sex with a prostitute			1
officers who investigate prostitution have n't been accused of sexual wrongdoing in recent memory , @entity220 said			2
a parole officer in 2011 was fired after being convicted of sexual assault against a prostitute , she said			0
skeptics , such as @entity230 , a retired special agent who for more than 20 years worked sex crimes for the @entity232 from @entity233 and has trained vice squads around the country , remain unconvinced			0
@entity230 said on thursday : ' i do n't know of any state or federal law that allows any law enforcement officer undercover to penetrate or do what this law is allowing			0
