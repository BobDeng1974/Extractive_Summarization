by @entity0 @entity2 star @entity1 is set to join @entity3 in a deal worth £ 63million , according to reports in @entity6			1
@entity8 report that the @entity10 playmaker will become @entity2 's record sale , beating the £ 42.5m received last summer from @entity12 for @entity13			1
the one stumbling block to the deal could be @entity16 's @entity15 regulations , as the @entity19 champions have already spent £ 50m buying @entity20 from @entity21			1
@entity22 - bound ? reports in the @entity6 media suggest @entity1 will be sold by @entity2 to @entity3 for £ 63m reports : monday 's edition of @entity8 ( left ) says that @entity1 is set to move for € 80m ( £ 63m ) , while @entity27 ( right ) leads on @entity29 's expectations the @entity10 playmaker will return for training on august 5 still here : @entity29 , pictured at saturday 's friendly with @entity33 , says no deal has been agreed for @entity1 @entity34 : @entity2 forward @entity1 was key to the club 's @entity36 success last season wanted : @entity39 is a keen admirer of @entity1 and would like to sign him for @entity41 in order to bring in @entity1 , @entity3 would have to offload one of their star assets , most likely the unsettled @entity43			1
but it may be possible for them to take @entity1 on a one - season loan to bypass the regulations before signing him permanently next summer			2
however , @entity2 manager @entity29 still expects the player , who helped @entity10 to the final of the @entity52 , to return to training on august 5			2
when asked if @entity1 was set to leave the @entity54 , @entity29 replied : ' there is nothing new in the market			0
@entity1 finished the @entity52 and he is resting			0
surplus ? @entity2 have already signed @entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) in midfield this summer on target : @entity62 scored @entity2 's only goal in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity33 but his side lost on penalties @entity67 predicts big season for @entity62 ' he will return on august 5 to start ( training ) together with his team - mates			1
' the @entity72 champions are currently on tour in the @entity74 and were beaten on penalties by @entity33 in a friendly in @entity77 on saturday after drawing 1 - 1 in normal time			0
@entity62 scored a spectacular long - range goal during normal time			0
real have already brought in @entity80 playmaker @entity59 and @entity81 @entity52 winner @entity58 this summer			0
reliable : @entity29 says he does not need another striker because he already has @entity83 ( pictured )			0

@entity6 paper marca report @entity1 will join @entity3 for £ 63m
would be a record sale for @entity72 champions , exceeding @entity13 last summer
@entity16 's @entity15 rules could *present* stumbling block
@entity1 could move on a season - long loan then sign next summer
but @entity29 expects @entity1 to report back for training on august 5
@entity29 says @entity1 is ' resting ' and ' there is nothing new in the market '
