by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 12:21 est , 14 january 2014 a @entity3 state is looking to extend its requirement that gun buyers undergo background checks and register their weapons to anyone who assembles a firearm in their home			2
the legislation by @entity14 state senator @entity13 is part of a growing effort across the country to pre-empt the spread of undetectable guns that can be made using 3 - d printers			1
his bill would also apply to anyone who buys parts that can be assembled into a gun			1
invisible killers : @entity14 state senator @entity13 ( holding a homemade automatic rifle ) has introduced a bill that would require anyone who assembles so - called ' ghost guns ' at home to undergo background checks ' no one knows they exist until after a crime has been committed ' : @entity36 's bill would also apply to anyone who buys parts that can be assembled into a gun @entity36 said he is trying to address a twin threat from what he called ' ghost guns ' - plastic weapons that can slip through metal detectors and unregistered weapons that can fall into the hands of people who are prohibited from owning firearms under state law			1
' currently , no one knows they exist until after a crime has been committed , ' said @entity36 , a leading candidate to take over as @entity58 leader next year			0
that was the case for @entity60 , who assembled his own military - style assault rifle and killed five people in @entity64 in a june rampage even after he was barred from legally buying a gun in @entity14 because of mental health issues			0
the bill by @entity36 , a @entity69 from @entity70 , goes further than the federal government , which last month renewed for 10 years an existing ban on plastic firearms that can evade metal detectors and x-ray machines			1
his bill , @entity78 , would allow the manufacture or assembly of homemade weapons , but require the makers to first apply to the state @entity83 for a serial number that would be given only after the applicants undergo a background check			1
moving targets : the bill goes further than the one passed by the @entity58 last month ( above ) which gave a 10 - year extension to the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and x-ray machines the number would have to be engraved on or otherwise permanently attached to the weapon within one day of its manufacture			1
he plans to amend the bill to also require that the guns contain permanent pieces of metal that could be detected by x-ray machines and metal detectors , a proposal that was blocked in the federal legislation			1
some plastic guns currently comply with the federal law by including a metal piece that can be removed , which potentially would allow them to be slipped through security screeners at airports , courthouses , schools and elsewhere			1
the @entity118 did not oppose the 10 - year extension of the federal plastic firearms ban			2
clamping down : the bill comes after @entity60 ( pictured ) killed five people in @entity64 with a military - style assault rifle he assembled himself in a june rampage but spokesman @entity126 said the organization opposes any expansion of the law at either the federal or state level			2
currently available technology allows consumers to download a gun 's design plans to a computer and then build it on a three - dimensional printer with no background checks or other safeguards			0
lawmakers in @entity141 and @entity142 have introduced legislation that would ban the possession of weapons made using @entity147 printers , said @entity149 policy specialist @entity148			2
however , while there had been talk by federal lawmakers and some state legislators of trying to restrict the posting of weapons plans on the @entity156 , @entity148 said he knows of no such legislation being introduced and said it would likely run into free speech protections			0
@entity160 , representing the @entity161 , said @entity36 's bill is particularly significant because as of january 1 , those buying rifles and shotguns in @entity14 are required to undergo the same registration and background checks as are required of those buying handguns			0
@entity14 is also the only state that cross-checks five computerized databases to find people who bought firearms but are not permitted to own them			0
@entity172 , who once served on the @entity173 on @entity174 and as an adviser to the @entity176 , is skeptical that new three - dimensional printing technology will lead to a flood of undetectable weapons , if only because it is simpler and cheaper to buy a traditional handgun			1
shooting : this photo shows the self - made assault rifle used by @entity185 , who was barred from legally buying a gun in @entity14 because of mental health issues moreover , new airport body scanners and x-ray machines can spot the outline of a gun even if it is made from plastic			2
however , proposals like @entity36 's have merit because they provide another tool to law enforcement , said @entity172 , a senior adviser to the president of the @entity200 think tank			0
@entity36 's bill would make violations misdemeanors punishable with a fine of up to $ 1,000 and up to a year in jail for an illegal handgun , up to six months for a rifle or shotgun			0
' as we come up with new types of technology , it creates new vulnerabilities , ' said @entity172 , who has written extensively on terrorism - related issues			0
' what you have then is an ongoing dynamic between bad guys and good guys			0

@entity219 by senator @entity13 aims to halt spread of undetectable weapons
would also apply to anyone who buys parts that can be made into a firearm
*dep* of *justice* serial number would have to be engraved onto the weapon
guns would need permanent pieces of metal that can be detected by x-ray
goes further than federal bill that extended ban on plastic guns which can evade airport detection
