new manager , same old problems			0
@entity3 ’s first game as @entity5 manager ended in defeat as 10 - man @entity7 escaped with a 1 - 0 win at the @entity9			1
@entity7 ’s @entity10 was sent off for a second bookable offence in first half stoppage time , giving @entity3 an ideal opportunity to start delivering on his promise of a @entity16 promotion push this season			1
but this was a welcome to the championship the new man at the helm will want to forget in a hurry , as @entity24 ’s second - half strike proved the winner for visitors @entity7			1
10 - men @entity7 battled out a 1 - 0 victory against @entity5 as night falls on the @entity9 @entity5 's new manager @entity3 salutes the home fans before the game @entity5 's @entity31 ( right ) competes for possession with @entity7 's @entity33 @entity5 : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity31 , @entity43			1
subs : @entity46 , @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51			0

scorer : @entity24 70 ' it had looked like @entity3 would have referee @entity69 to thank come saturday evening			2
the official booked @entity7 defender @entity10 half hour in for holding back striker @entity43 , before showing the @entity71 a second yellow before half time for deliberate handball			1
and , in truth , @entity5 should have taken advantage			2
chances fell the way of @entity42 and @entity43 , among others , but all squandered whatever sniff they were given of the @entity7 goal			2
it took just 40 seconds for @entity5 to mount their first attack , though @entity43 ’s side - footed volley served only as a warning when it went high over the crossbar			1
seven minutes later @entity7 ’s @entity10 gave away an inviting free - kick 22 yards out after a blatant nudge in @entity43 ’s back			1
@entity90 stepped up , but only found the stands			0
still , it was a promising start from a side that had lost 6 - 1 against @entity94 last week before the sacking of manager @entity96 on monday			2
@entity3 cut an animated figure on the touchline , jotting notes in his pad throughout as @entity5 looked to establish a foothold in a scrappy affair			2
@entity5 's @entity39 ( right ) appeals for handball that subsequently saw @entity105 sent off goalscorer @entity24 ( right ) chases down @entity5 's @entity41 during an improbable victory neither side could truly take command in the first 45 minutes			1
possession was wasted and chances came in dribs and drabs , particularly from distance or on the counter-attack			0
it was the latter that led referee ward to produce @entity10 ’s first yellow card when he dragged @entity43 back to prevent @entity5 a breakaway			2
‘ this is a library , ’ sang the traveling @entity7 support of 2,749			2
they were n’t entirely wrong			0
the @entity122 atmosphere which @entity3 raved about in his pre-match programme notes was found wanting			0
that is , until the opening minute of first half stoppage time			0
@entity5 's @entity43 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity54 @entity39 ran at 25 - year - old @entity10 who , falling to ground , handled the ball on the edge of the box as the @entity5 winger looked to get past			1
the referee deemed it intentional and produced a second yellow to leave @entity7 a man shy for more than 45 minutes			0
after the break , the best chance of the match fell to @entity43			0
the striker had only @entity7 goalkeeper @entity52 to beat from inside the box to the left , but his shot agonisingly went beyond the far post			0
@entity7 scrambled to get out of their own half			2
but again , lines were fluffed			0
@entity39 beat @entity7 ’s @entity151 before finding @entity42 alone at the back post , only for the @entity5 forward to lose his footing and slice what seemed a sure - thing			1
@entity5 's @entity43 ( centre ) is challenged by @entity7 's @entity54 ( right ) and @entity151 they were made to pay			1
a cut back from the left by @entity160 found the approaching @entity24 who , with a low drive and in space , found the net beyond goalkeeper @entity34			1
it was against the play , but @entity7 were ruthless in taking their chance with 10 men			0
they threw men forward , but never made @entity52 break a sweat			0
the trouble is , @entity3 may have arrived at the @entity175 , but he is stuck with a squad shy of confidence			0
@entity178 rang around upon the final whistle as @entity7 left 1 - 0 winners , and @entity3 's promotion promise fell on deaf ears .			1

@entity7 defeated @entity5 1 - 0 in their championship *clash* at the @entity175
@entity105 was sent off for the @entity187 on the stroke of half - time
@entity24 scored the winner after meeting a cross from @entity160
