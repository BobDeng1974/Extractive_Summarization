by @entity0 taunts and ridicule : @entity3 , 44 , was 30 when her sweat , breath and urine started to smell of fish for 14 years , @entity3 has been blighted by an incredibly rare and embarrassing genetic disorder			1
the company director , 44 , is one of only a handful of people with a condition that leaves her smelling of fish or rotten eggs			1
but it took seven years to finally diagnose her after doctors dismissed her concerns – and even gave her humiliating lectures on personal hygiene and how to wash properly			0
the disorder , known as trimethylaminuria , or fish - odour syndrome , has had a devastating impact on her life since it developed when she was 30			1
dubbed ‘ smelly @entity3 ’ by bullies , she has been taunted and ridiculed by strangers			2
she is the butt of office jokes – receiving soap or perfume as secret @entity36 presents – and has even had bottles of body spray posted anonymously through her letter box			1
miss @entity3 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ‘ at first i did n’t understand what was wrong			2
i ’d always had impeccable hygiene			0
the smell was a complete mystery – i wondered if my cat had brought in a mouse and left it to rot			2
‘ but i slowly realised it was me when strangers began to stare at me while holding their noses			0
i heard people whispering about me in the office			2
‘ i would come home from work every night and cry			0
soon people were showering me with gifts of perfume			0
at christmas i ’d get soap – it was completely humiliating			0
‘ once a driver actually installed an air freshener on the bus i use , and a passenger said it was my fault			0
it was soul - destroying – it was a real struggle getting out of bed in the morning			0
’ at one point miss @entity3 was having a bath five times a day			1
and in desperation she resorted to scrubbing her skin with kitchen detergent until it was red raw			1
teased : her workmates would give @entity3 soap and perfume as presents in the office secret @entity36 as a joke ‘ i was at my wits ’ end , ’ she told the @entity82			1
the condition is caused by an enzyme missing which causes a strong odour in sweat , urine and breath – usually described as like rotting fish , faeces or rubbish			1
it is created when the body is unable to break down the smelly chemical trimethylamine that is produced in the gut when certain foods , such as dairy , coffee , meat and fish , are digested , and there is currently no cure			2
after suffering with the condition for five years , miss @entity3 plucked up the courage to visit her gp in 2005 , but she was left feeling humiliated after being lectured on personal hygiene			1
as a result , she did not return to see her doctor until a year later , when she was finally taken seriously			0
treatment : finally , after persuading her gp to reassess her condition , she was referred to a hormone specialist who put her on an intense programme of antibiotics and a unique diet , which has calmed her symptoms tests were carried out and she was eventually diagnosed in 2007			1
she said : ‘ although it was hard to swallow , i felt relief			0
’ miss @entity3 was referred to an endocrinologist – an expert on hormones – who put her on antibiotics and a diet plan			1
she said : ‘ i began to wash with a @entity129 - balanced soap after i found out that washing excessively with normal soap made the smell even worse			1
there is no cure but making these changes helps			0
’ she added : ‘ now , when someone holds their nose , i take them aside and explain that i have a medical condition			0
i hope my story will help educate those who point fingers , and encourage other sufferers to find the strength to get help			0
’ miss @entity3 ’s partner , @entity146 , 50 , said : ‘ @entity3 is a lovely person and that ’s all that matters			2
