by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 17 march 2013 facebook users love to connect with old friends without having to meet them face - to - face , but one man has vowed to personally buck the trend by meeting and photographing all 788 of his friends — half of whom he ’s never even met			2
@entity9 believes our social media - driven society has weakened the bonds between individuals by making it too easy to brush off old friends or quickly connect without having real conversation			1
to change this , or at least demonstrate that there is an alternative , the @entity18 man has decided to personally meet each of his nearly 800 online pals			0
@entity30 explains his intentions , which include a documentary film of the project dubbed ‘ @entity40 : accepted , ’ on his @entity42 campaign fundraising page			1
‘ the idea is to capture everyone doing something they are passionate about , while filming the whole process … i want to sit down with everyone and witness what gets their blood pumping			0
old school : @entity30 ( pictured ) wants to film his quest and says it will stand in contrast to our cold online interactions , according to his @entity42 page those passions include fighting fires and sculpting with fire , modern dance , and weight lifting , among many others			1
interestingly , @entity30 freely admits ‘ at least half of those 788 people , [ he ’s ] never even spoken to			2
’ nonetheless , @entity30 wo n’t be quickly snapping a few digital photos of his subjects			0
to parallel his analog approach to personal connection , the filmmaker / photographer will be snapping shots using an old - fashioned @entity78 camera			0
diverse and dispersed : @entity30 's friends , like @entity81 of @entity82 ( pictured ) , are as geographically dispersed as their interests are diverse and he has n't even met half of them arduous : each of the 788 photos will be shot with an old @entity78 film camera , which takes about an hour and @entity30 aims to finish the project in 3 years ‘ the process of shooting with this camera is long and tedious , ’ @entity30 writes			1
‘ it can be a pain in the ass sometimes , but it also allows me to spend time with these people			0
each portrait takes about an hour to complete			0
’ so how long will a project that aims to photograph 788 geographically dispersed people , all doing what they love , take ? ‘ my plan , ’ writes @entity30 , ‘ is to take five new portraits every week … it will take approximately three years			2
’ @entity30 ’s original fundraising goal for the filming , photographing , and travel expenses amounted to $ 5,000			1
popular : @entity30 's goal to raise $ 5k has been met and more than doubled and his @entity28 friends are adding up just as quickly with nine days left to donate , 212 backers had pledged well over double that with an impressive $ 12,500			1
even with the extra money , @entity30 ’s goal is a lofty one			2
‘ i 'll roll with the punches , ’ he promises donors , ‘ making this my number one priority until it 's @entity118 material			0
’ meanwhile , @entity30 ’s @entity28 friend count has risen right along with the popularity of his project			1
from 788 , it has quickly risen to over 1,200 .			0

@entity9 's quest will take around three years
he 's met and more than doubled his @entity42 fundraising goal of $ 5k and his friends on @entity28 are adding up fast
@entity30 says he 's lifting ' the screen of social media '
