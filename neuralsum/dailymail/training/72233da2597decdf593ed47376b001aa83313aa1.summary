the woman , who police did not identify by name , said she often thought about escaping but stayed out of fear , even though in recent years she was not physically held captive			2
she told police that @entity24 said her mother was not looking for her and that if she contacted authorities , her family would be deported			1
then , in april , the woman got in touch with her mother after finding her sister on @entity51 to wish her a happy birthday , @entity48 police cpl. @entity46 said			1
