the word suggests travelling with a worry - free , devil - may - care attitude			0
but in the world of mobile phones , where roaming means using your device abroad , that approach is unwise			1
making calls , downloading emails and browsing the internet when in another country can result in very large bills			1
so how can you keep roaming costs down ? the best option is to be with mobile operator three			0
its customers can call and text @entity20 numbers and use data in some countries at no extra cost to their @entity20 price plans			1
three is the only operator to offer this arrangement , which it calls @entity28			2
three 's @entity29 covers 18 destinations in @entity32 , @entity33 , the @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 in september 2013 , when @entity30 introduced @entity38 , it covered seven destinations			1
i said then that to be a game - changer it needed to expand the service to more countries – and it has			2
with @entity47 and @entity48 added earlier this month , it now applies in 18 countries			1
in @entity32 , the deal also covers @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
elsewhere , it covers @entity33 , the @entity34 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2
given that @entity47 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity34 are among the most popular destinations for @entity20 , @entity30 claims that about two - thirds of its customers ’ overseas trips are now covered by @entity70			1
three publicises @entity73 by saying that it enables you to ‘ use your phone abroad at no extra cost ’			1
but to call or text @entity81 numbers – imagine you are in @entity47 and you phone a restaurant in @entity83 – you will be charged extra , at roaming rates			2
however , these are much lower than other operators ’ standard rates in some countries – for example , 15.6p per minute to call local numbers in the @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity48			0
there are some other caveats , too – one being you ca n’t ‘ tether ’ ( use your phone to connect another device to the internet )			0
check all details on @entity97			0
nonetheless , if you ’re travelling to a feel at home country , using @entity30 is the most preferable option			1
when travelling , operators ’ bundles / add - ons usually offer better value than their standard rates take roaming in @entity48			0
on their standard rates for pay - monthly customers , rival operators charge up to £ 1.50 a minute for making and receiving calls , 35p to 50p for sending a text , and up to £ 8 per megabyte of data usage			2
in @entity115 countries , roaming charges are much lower as they are capped			0
on operators ’ standard rates , you ’ll pay about 18p or 19p per minute to make a call , 5p per minute to receive a call , 5p to 6p to send a text and 20p per megabyte of data			0
if you ’re not with @entity30 and are heading to a @entity70 destination , operators ’ bundles / add - ons usually offer better value than their standard rates – though it depends on your usage levels			1
to give one example , @entity129 lets you use your @entity20 ’s plan allowance for calls , texts and data for £ 3 a day in @entity32 , and £ 5 a day in some countries further afield			1
however , you will need to actively sign up to get this deal			0
if you have an unlocked handset , you might consider investing in a local , country - specific sim card : see 0044.co.uk , uk2abroad.com or dataroam.co.uk for details			0
otherwise , stick to using free wi - fi in , for example , hotels and cafes , which will also enable you to chat for free if you have a @entity144 or @entity145 account			0
