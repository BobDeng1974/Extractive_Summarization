the daughter of an oil magnate and his ex-wife who just slammed a court 's ruling saying that the $ 1billion payout she is set to receive in her divorce is ' inappropriate ' and ' not fair ' was married in a very private and secretive ceremony in the middle of her parents contentious trial			1
@entity15 , whose mother @entity16 just received the second highest divorce settlement in @entity19 history from her husband , and @entity15 's father , @entity21 , wed @entity22 at the @entity25 @entity24 resort and hotel in @entity27 , @entity28			1
and shockingly , the ceremony happened on october 4 , as @entity29 and mr. @entity21 were in the middle of their 10 week trial over her divorce settlement			1
it is uncertain if both mr. @entity21 and @entity29 attended their daughter 's wedding , though mother and daughter were in conversation on @entity64 in the days following as miss @entity16 checked in with her daughter following the wedding , making it appear that the mother of the bride was in attendance for the big day			1
the attractive , young newlyweds , who got engaged in november 2013 , live in @entity28 where @entity15 works for the @entity72 of @entity73 according to her @entity74			2
they honeymooned at the pricey and private @entity76 resort in @entity77 , @entity78			0
gorgeous setting : the wedding ceremony took place at the @entity25 @entity24 resort and hotel in @entity27 , @entity28 lavish look : flowers spilled over the tables inside the during the recption getaway : the newlyweds honeymooned at the pricey and private @entity76 resort in @entity77 , @entity78 miss @entity16 and mr. @entity21 also have a second daughter , @entity89 , who attends @entity90			1
miss @entity16 has appealed the ruling made last month in an @entity94 , @entity93 courtroom , citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in one of @entity19 's greatest oil fortunes			1
the oil fortune she refers to is that of @entity104 , the company founded by her ex-husband @entity21 in 1967 , who himself is worth $ 9billion			2
the couple never signed a prenuptial agreement			0
pay up : mr. @entity21 and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup , meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage real estate portfolio : miss @entity16 also picked up three properties in the divorce , including this home in @entity116 , @entity93 this as miss @entity16 has taken ownership of the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity28 , a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $ 14.7million , along with the couple 's two of their @entity93 properties , as per the court 's ruling			1
mr. @entity21 will take their $ 750,000 home in @entity129 , @entity130 and a $ 300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in @entity132 , @entity93			2
as for the appeal , miss @entity16 made it clear just days after the november 10 ruling that officially made her a billionaire that she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued			1
the only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the @entity19 was @entity141 , who reportedly received $ 2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband @entity142 in 1999			1
relaxed living : the @entity116 home has been valued at $ 800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in @entity93 all good ? : miss @entity148 's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce miss @entity148 stated that she felt that the decision by judge @entity153 to allow lawyers for both her husband and for @entity104 to be involved in the proceedings was ' inappropriate ' in that it allowed them to ' double team ' her			1
the crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and mr. @entity21 made beginning in 1988 , the year he and @entity29 were married			0
during the trial it was argued that @entity104 ’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors , such as rising oil prices , and , under @entity93 law , only the ' active ' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division			0
miss @entity16 ’s lawyers contend however that @entity176 miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $ 14billion rise in the value of mr. @entity21 's @entity104 shares during the marriage - 6 percent			1
' as @entity16 has stated previously , 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage , and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal , ' her legal team said in a statement			0
the mansion : miss @entity148 also got the couple 's second @entity93 home located in @entity196 and worth $ 4.6million big growth : during the course of their marriage , mr. @entity21 's company 's worth jumped from $ 50million to $ 20billion miss @entity16 , who worked as a lawyer for @entity104 when she and mr. @entity21 married , and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company , also claims that @entity176 undervalued her own contributions to the couple ’s wealth			1
most estimates have stated that @entity104 was worth around $ 50million in 1988 when the couple married , which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $ 20billion behemoth it is today			0
a behemoth that mr. @entity21 has a 68 percent stake in , a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be ' separate property			2
' all this , combined with lingering timeline questions presented by @entity29 that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple 's 1988 wedding , will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years			0
and there 's somehow more			0
that aforementioned $ 9billion fortune of mr. @entity21 's was in fact a $ 20billion fortune as recently as august , with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil			2
started from the bottom : mr. @entity21 was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper working his way up : he pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well filing for divorce in march 2013 , miss @entity16 alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair , citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage			1
mr. @entity21 had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world , a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the @entity19 dream			2
born one of 13 children to a sharecropper , mr. @entity21 worked his way up , picking cotton as a child , pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well			0
and while mr. @entity21 , who was previously married and has three children from that union , is no fan of the spotlight , he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years			0
in 2012 , mr. @entity21 became a big part of @entity275 's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser , a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $ 985,000 to the @entity279			0
mr. @entity21 also hosted a fundraiser at his $ 4.6 million @entity281 , @entity93 mansion for the @entity72 candidate , which raised more than $ 2million			0
it is worth noting that the @entity196 mansion is no longer mr. @entity21 's but , along with a $ 800,000 home in @entity116 , @entity93 , the property of @entity29			2
big score : in 2012 , mr. @entity21 was one of the select few named to the @entity290 , an event he attended with his wife friends in high places : 2012 was also the year mr. @entity21 became an adviser for the @entity275 campaign it was also in early 2012 that mr. @entity21 earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was named to the @entity290 for that year			0
he and his wife attended the ceremony together that april in @entity301 that also honored , among others , @entity304 , supreme court associate justice @entity305 , president @entity306 and @entity307			0
the two posed on the red carpet together , smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another , looking happy and excited			0
miss @entity16 would file for divorce less than a year later .			1

@entity15 , the oldest daughter of @entity21 and his ex-wife @entity16 was married in october at the @entity25 @entity24 resort in @entity27
the wedding occurred as her parents were in the middle of their highly contentious divorce trial , which lasted 10 weeks
in november , miss @entity16 was awarded $ 1billion and property in the divorce settlement
miss @entity16 has appealed the $ 1billion payout she received in her divorce from her ex-husband , oil giant @entity21
in her appeal , miss @entity16 points out 78 alleged errors , while also calling the presiding judge to task for letting her husband have two teams of lawyers
the settlement is the second highest ever in the @entity19 , after the $ 2.5billion reportedly received by @entity141 in 1999
