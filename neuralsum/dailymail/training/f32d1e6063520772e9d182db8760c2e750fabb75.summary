' life - saving : @entity5 was taken to the @entity53 , pictured , after his mother demanded a second opinion			1
they discovered he was suffering a stroke rather than a migraine as first diagnosed ' even with me being a neuro - nurse , i did n't think this could happen			1

@entity5 , 15 , was *tackled* on the rugby pitch four days before being taken ill
doctors now believe the injury severed an artery which *created* a stroke - causing clot

he suffered a second stroke in hospital and has spent the last year learning how to move and speak again because of his injuries
