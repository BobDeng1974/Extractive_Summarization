when summer is up and it ’s time to go back to school , children often suffer from a bout of ' back to school blues ' as they begrudgingly return to class			2
but a researcher has claimed that the effect is n’t limited to people ; dogs also get upset when their young owners leave			1
in a study they found that for many dogs this can leave them feeling abandoned , and some look for a way to lash out			2
it occurs when their young owners go back to school at the end of summer			1
dr @entity30 says this can leave the dogs feeling lonely and abandoned			1
in extreme cases this can lead to them lashing out the research was compiled by dr @entity30 of @entity21 's @entity38 in @entity22			1
make your departure a happy time with toys and treats			2
create a place in the house where the dog feels safe			0
start the new routine before school begins			0
do n't indulge behavior with baby talk or sympathy			0
see a vet if it does n't improve			0
he found that many of the 80 million dogs in the @entity57 had separation anxiety			2
this led them to bark , howl or whine when their owners were gone			0
in more extreme cases the departure of a young owner to school at the start of school can lead to the dogs scratching doors , damaging blinds or tearing curtains in their anxiety			1
and the side effects of children going back to school do n't stop there ; dr @entity30 also says that some dogs refuse to eat when their owners are gone			1
‘ there will be an exuberant greeting when you do come home , one that can last several minutes and be completely crazy , then the dog will run to the food bowl , ’ he said			0
for millions of dogs across the @entity57 , summer is gone and so are their best buddies			0
most dogs object for a while but eventually adjust to the new hours			0
but millions of others will feel abandoned , panicky , sad and unable to cope as they look for ways to lash out , according to research by dr @entity30 of @entity21 in addition , nearly half of anxious dogs were found to have noise phobias , so if a storm hits while they are in an empty house , they can panic			1
dr @entity30 suggests that to ease anxiety in dogs , the departure of children to school should be made a happy time with toys and treats			1
he also suggests creating a place in the house where the dog feels safe			2
but ultimately , if the condition of the dog does n’t improve he suggests seeing a vet is the best option			0
