a @entity1 astrophotographer has captured a dazzling image of the @entity3 from his back garden			2
@entity5 took the colourful photograph from his backyard observatory using a 12 inch f / 4 @entity9 telescope			1
the image show swirls of vivid colours in the star - forming region of the nebula which are created by the release of oxygen and hydrogen gases			1
it is 1,500 light years away from @entity30 and is believed to be 24 light years wide			0
the nebula can be seen with the naked eye near the constellation @entity28			0
it is the closest region of massive star formation to @entity30 and has a mass about 2000 times that of the sun. the @entity3 is one of the most photographed objects in the light sky and it has revealed a lot about how stars are created from collapsing clouds of gas and dust			2
the beautiful image is impressive , but mr @entity5 does admit that it has been processed using computer software including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
mr @entity5 told @entity49 : ‘ the weather was not very good this winter , so it took a few nights to catch the data			1
’ the @entity3 , also known as @entity24 , is a diffuse nebula situated south of @entity26 in the constellation of @entity28			0

mr @entity5 is not the first astrophotographer to capture the nebula from his back garden – mathematician @entity78 , from @entity79 in @entity80 , has also managed to capture stunning images of it from his garden			2
mr @entity78 managed to record the images by using very long exposures to ' soak up ' as much light as possible as his motorised telescope tracked across the sky			0
amazingly , he did it all on a second - hand telescope he received as a @entity91 present			0
the image show swirls of vivid colours in the star - forming region of the nebula which are created by the release of oxygen and hydrogen gases			1

@entity5 used a 12 inch f / 4 @entity9 telescope to take photograph
it contains dazzling colours created by *emission* of oxygen and hydrogen
he admits that it has been processed using software including @entity23
