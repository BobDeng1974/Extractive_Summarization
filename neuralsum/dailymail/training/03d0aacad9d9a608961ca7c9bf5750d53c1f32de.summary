by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 concedes his years of experience have taught him to be ' massively relaxed ' about his @entity5 future			1
ahead of this weekend 's @entity7 @entity6 at @entity8 , @entity2 is currently in limbo as he waits for @entity11 's top brass to make a decision on the team 's driver line - up for next season			1
out of contract in a few months ' time , @entity2 faces the prospect of his 15 - year run in the sport coming to an end			1
in the balance : @entity2 's @entity5 future is uncertain beyond the 2014 season in the driving seat : driving his @entity11 , @entity2 tours in free practice at @entity8 ahead of the @entity7 @entity6 rumours of @entity11 attempting to poach @entity28 or @entity29 , despite both being tied to their respective contracts with @entity32 and @entity33 , have been rife of late			1
@entity2 , however , takes it all in his stride as he said : ' i 've been racing in @entity5 for 15 years			1
you go through a lot in your career , you hear a lot of b * * * * * * *			2
' initially it 's annoying , but then you 're like ' you know what , i 've been here before , been in this situation before , heard it before '			2
' so you just get on with your job , and i love racing in @entity5			1
' every time i jump in a car i do the best job i can - and it does n't matter who it 's for or where it is - i do the best for myself , the team and the fans			0
' that 's not going to change because you never do a half - hearted job , you always do the best you can , you want to beat your team - mate and you want to beat every single guy out there			0
' nothing changes , just the length of time you have available to fulfil your dreams			0
' so i 'm massively relaxed			2
' thinking it over : despite being contracted to @entity32 , @entity28 has been linked with a shock return to @entity11 where he he left under a cloud following a turbulent 2007 season proven champion : current world champion @entity29 has also been linked with a @entity11 move in a recent interview @entity2 remarked if he had ' to retire at the end of the year , then so be it '			1
it is the first time he has mentioned the word ' retirement ' , although claims there was a reason on this occasion			0
' when you 're asked the question ( about his future ) so many times you 've got to say something different else it gets boring , ' said @entity2			1
' not for you guys , but for me it gets boring			0
i 'm so bored of answering the same questions			0
' i said if i was n't racing at the end of the season , so be it			0
that 's what i said			0
' if i 'm not racing , so be it			0
i ca n't do much about that , but it 's not that i 'm getting ready because i definitely do n't want to retire for many years			2
' with regard to @entity11 's overtures towards @entity28 , @entity2 is far from concerned given the @entity101 is contracted to @entity32 through to the end of 2016			1
@entity105 ceo @entity104 recently stated he is a man who respects contracts , and with @entity28 saying he is keen to remain at the @entity108 marque , the rumours appear groundless			1
@entity2 added : ' that does n't change my cause at all			2
it does n't change anything because he was always staying at @entity32			0

@entity2 is in last year of his @entity11 contract
@entity28 and @entity29 linked with moves to @entity118 outfit
@entity2 has no *plans* to retire and is relaxed over his future in @entity5
