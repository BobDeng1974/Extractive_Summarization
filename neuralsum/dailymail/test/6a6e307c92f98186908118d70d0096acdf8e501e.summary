@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes @entity2 is more than capable of handling the highs and lows which accompany the tremendous expectation which rests on his shoulders			1
the 1 - 0 victory over @entity9 , courtesy of captain @entity12 's fifth goal of the season , was a case in point			1
in the first half he produced a brilliant piece of control and skill to skip past three opponents and launch an attack from deep inside his own half which brought @entity24 to its feet			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes @entity2 is capable of handling the pressure on him @entity0 ( left ) said he thought @entity2 was ' different class ' despite a mistake with an ambitious pass however , when his ambitious pass after the break gifted possession to the visitors the all - too familiar sound of loud groans echoed around the ground			1
then , to cap it all , manager @entity38 's decision to replace him with 20 minutes to go - a requirement to help shore up a tight game - was greeted with disagreement and boos			2
it is difficult to know what @entity2 , who was lauded for two substitute appearances for @entity45 in the last 10 days , thought of it , but @entity0 is confident the youngster can deal with the complexities and confusion which appear to surround most of his performances			1
' i think @entity2 was different class , ' he said			1
' i thought he worked really hard for the team and was a real nuisance driving at people and it was brilliant to see him high in confidence having been away with @entity45			2
@entity2 was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go at @entity24 , a decision that brought boos from the crowd ' @entity2 is a good lad and has his feet firmly on the ground and has a lot of people at the club looking after him			1
' he wo n't get carried away			0
we have a lot of characters , a lot of experienced heads in the dressing room and there is no better place to be for him			0
' aside from @entity12 's 16th - minute goal , giving the centre - back his best tally in eight years at the club , the only other notable action saw goalkeeper @entity79 claw away @entity81 's early shot from under his crossbar and throw out a hand , while diving the wrong way , to stop @entity86 's strike			2
@entity1 achieved what they were unable to do earlier in the season and ground out victory to make it three successive wins , moving them to 11th in the table , with the relegation fears of a couple of weeks ago now a thing of the past			1
with nothing to play for in their remaining seven matches @entity0 believes the motivation is to remain unbeaten until the end of the campaign			2
@entity0 is confident youngster @entity2 can deal with the complexities of his sometimes indifferent form ' we want to kick on , go on a winning run and finish the season strongly , ' he added			1
' we have won three games and we want to go unbeaten until the end of the season , although that is easier said than done			0
' there has been a big improvement			0
so far , so good , but we wo n't get carried away			0
' the most important thing was to get three points and dig in deep to secure it with a clean sheet			0
' with leading scorer @entity118 not quite ready to return after a hamstring injury , the onus was on other players to step up , but few would have bet on @entity12 being the match winner against @entity9			0
@entity1 secured a 1 - 0 victory over @entity9 , courtesy of captain @entity12 's fifth goal of the season ' he is different class			1
he is brilliant to have at the club and is a true leader on the pitch , ' said @entity0			2
' a lot of people have been saying the last few weeks he has been exceptional , but for me he has been outstanding throughout the campaign and he is chipping in with goals			0
' @entity9 boss @entity136 conceded his side 's @entity138 hopes were now over , but was still keen to secure @entity141 football next season			0
@entity9 boss @entity136 conceded his side 's @entity138 hopes were now over ' @entity141 football for the club will be a great success if we reach it , ' he said			0
' if we showed the ambition we showed ( against @entity1 ) then we will have a good chance			1
' @entity151 international @entity81 has not scored in nine matches for his club - he did manage one against @entity45 in midweek - but @entity136 still backs him			2
' @entity81 is struggling but that is football , it is normal			0
if i do n't have confidence i do n't pick him in the line - up , ' he added .			0
