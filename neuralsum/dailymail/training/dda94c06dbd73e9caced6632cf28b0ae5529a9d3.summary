by @entity1 reporter published : 11:38 est , 1 july 2012 updated : 11:42 est , 1 july 2012 four @entity3 men , including a retired judge , are being extradited to @entity5 to face @entity7 money laundering charges			1
@entity8 , 68 , his son @entity9 , 31 , and their colleagues @entity11 , 44 , and @entity12 , 41 are accused of using companies they run to launder @entity7 money			1
they intend to plead not guilty , insisting they are completely innocent - but face spending 18 months in jail with hardened criminals before their case even comes to trial			2
the men are being extradited under a controversial @entity24 ( @entity25 ) system that allows foreign authorities to demand suspects without providing any evidence against them			1
retired judge @entity8 , centre , with his son @entity9 and wife @entity31			1
the two men are being extradited to @entity5 on @entity7 money laundering charges the case is the latest in a string of controversial extraditions enforced using @entity25 ’s			1
which were introduced in 2002 by the @entity39 , following the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
the warrants were intended as a means to deal with terror suspects in other countries , but critics claim they are being abused to arrest and extradite people accused of far lesser offences , many of whom are innocent			2
parliamentary figures back up the suggestion , revealing @entity3 surrenders 11 people under @entity53 for every one brought to the @entity3 - prompting @entity55 mp @entity54 to campaign against the unfair use of the warrants			2
mr @entity11 was put on an flight from @entity59 to @entity60 on friday			0
the other three men are expected to join him over the coming days - including mr @entity8 snr , a former criminal barrister , who spent eight years as a judge in courts across @entity65 and the @entity66 - they will then be held at @entity67 on the outskirts of the capital , where they face a wait of a year and a half before they get the chance to prove their innocence in court			1
the four men are alleged to be involved in a £ 344 million money laundering scheme , through @entity65 - based commodity brokerage and telecoms firms companies they run			1
it ’s claimed the companies engaged in carousel vat fraud in @entity5 - acting as ‘ fictitious clients so that money generated by the fraud was laundered through the companies ’ accounts			1
’ they were arrested in february 2010 in a raid on their homes by officers from the @entity95 and @entity96 ( @entity97 ) armed with @entity98 issued by a magistrate in @entity5			0
incarcerated : the four men face spending 18 months in @entity60 's @entity100 before their case even comes to trial their assets were frozen and restraining orders were placed on their homes , to stop them from being sold			0
the men , who have nine children between them , are particularly concerned about the fate of their families - who have only been able to draw £ 300 a week from their frozen assets they fought extradition but lost that battle in january 2011 , when @entity115 magistrates ruled they should travel to @entity5 to face trial for involvement in what an @entity5 judge described as a ‘ transnational criminal organisation consisting of more than 10 people ' and ' complicit in money laundering			1
’ they appealed and appeared at the @entity124 in february before @entity125 , a former colleague of mr @entity8 ' , who denied the appeal , insisting there was sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation			2
last ditch approaches to the @entity131 and home secretary @entity132 failed and the extradition is going ahead - despite the fact the men claim they have never been charged or shown any evidence against them			1
mr @entity8 snr , from @entity136 , @entity137 , told the @entity138 : ‘ we were dragged out of bed at 5am , yet we ’ve never been questioned by the prosecutors in the case			2
we have never been charged or shown details of the case against us			0
as a result we have not been able to put up any defence			0
’ speaking before his extradition , he added : ‘ we have conducted our business dealings with the @entity5 companies impeccably , but the investigating magistrate looking into them on another matter came across our names on a number of documents			0
as a result , instead of coming over here and talking to us about it , he has sought a warrant for our arrest			0
‘ we will be thrown into @entity60 ’s worst prison for what our @entity5 lawyers say could be up to six months before being charged and another year of pretrial detention			0
@entity5 has the worst legal system in @entity167 , where the standard practice is to threaten and induce detainees in order to obtain admission of guilt in exchange for a reduced sentence			0
it ’s worse than plea bargaining , because we are going to be locked up in a foreign country without access to proper legal representation , no bail and our assets frozen			0

four men are being extradited under controversial @entity184
they include @entity8 , a 68 - year - old former judge
accused of using companies they run to launder @entity7 money
men insist they *'re* innocent and have never been shown the evidence against them
