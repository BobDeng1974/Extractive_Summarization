@entity1 captain @entity0 is at the centre of the escalating row between @entity4 and adidas over the leisure kit being worn by the players in @entity8			1
@entity9 are taking action over the way @entity4 have been allowed by the @entity12 to deck the @entity1 squad in their gear with little or no @entity12 branding , in addition to the official supply items for on and off the pitch			2
this has meant @entity0 and the other adidas ambassadors in the @entity1 camp - @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 - being photographed with only @entity4 logos visible , much to adidas ’s considerable annoyance			1
the @entity12 , who are revamping their commercial operation , are relaxed about @entity4 ’s ambush tactics but it puts @entity0 in particular in a tricky position when he wants to concentrate on the football			1

. during a @entity41 in which the @entity62 have fielded their first ever all - black panel - @entity65 , @entity67 and @entity68 - at a major championship as part of a welcome diversity push , the @entity12 parted company with @entity72 , national coach for seven years and one of the few elite black coaches in the game			1
the split has n’t gone unnoticed by the @entity12 inclusion board charged with overseeing the campaign to increase the number of black managers and coaches in the game			0
minister for sport @entity82 said in @entity83 on thursday : ‘ i do want to see much more done across football			0
’ sir @entity85 , who is far more likely to be seen at @entity86 watching the cricket , saw his first @entity1 football away match for 51 years in @entity90			0
the last time sir @entity85 saw @entity1 play abroad was in 1963 while he was a student in @entity93			0
he was invited to @entity1 ’s @entity41 opener after bringing his @entity96 show to @entity83			2

. @entity97 , the @entity98 attorney leading the inquiry into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 @entity101 , has bizarrely been asking about receipts from the 24 @entity104 handbags doled out as gifts by @entity1 ’s doomed 2018 bid			0
if @entity97 wants to see the bags , all of which were returned , they are still gathering dust in a @entity113 cupboard			0
@entity114 special one @entity116 manager @entity115 , who already has ambassador roles with @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and the @entity121 , has started talks with @entity123 about representing them as well			1
@entity123 see @entity115 as their response to @entity125 having @entity126 as their £ 4m - a - year ambassador , although @entity115 is expected to be cheaper for @entity123 , who are also making overtures to sir @entity130 ahead of their @entity132 coverage that starts in 2015 - 16			1
@entity115 used to be a @entity125 ambassador , describing their 2009 football coverage as ‘ special ’			1
call up : @entity115 , who already has an ambassador role with @entity119 , has started talks with @entity123 @entity137 is not the only @entity62 co-commentator who has attracted criticism from inside @entity140			1
@entity142 ’s description of a @entity143 defender bringing down @entity145 ’s @entity144 to preserve the lead as a ‘ good foul ’ brought immediate disapproval from @entity149 on @entity150			2
there is still no plan for how the £ 180m @entity90 stadium will be used after the @entity41 , with no club in the region big enough for its 42,000 - capacity arena			2
an @entity158 state judge suggested it be turned into a detention centre to ease prison overcrowding			0
but security is n’t a @entity8 strongpoint , as the mass @entity143 fan break - in at the @entity165 suggests			0
criticism : @entity142 's use of the term a ' good foul ' brought immediate disapproval from @entity149 they may fancifully claim that 46million tuned into @entity171 ’ @entity173 language coverage of the @entity1 v @entity175 game			1
but the only way @entity178 presenter @entity177 and his similarly forgotten sidekick @entity179 can create even a ripple of interest about themselves is to have a go at your @entity185 columnist on their hopeless @entity188 video on successive days .			0

@entity0 caught up in spat between @entity4 and adidas
@entity62 *unveil* first ever @entity41 panel with @entity65 , @entity67 and @entity68
@entity115 in talks to represent @entity123 as ambassador
@entity142 , like @entity137 , attracts criticism from *fellow* @entity62 staff
