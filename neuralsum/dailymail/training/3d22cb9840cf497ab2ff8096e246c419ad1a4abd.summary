former @entity1 gov. @entity0 said sunday that the thorny question of whether to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples should be decided at the state level			1
the position , a political insider in @entity1 told @entity8 , is calculated to leave his options open as he considers a run for the presidency next year			1
' it ought be a local decision			0
i mean , a state decision , ' the former governor told the @entity17 after a round of golf			2
the people of the state decided			0
but it 's been overturned by the courts , i guess			0
the couple successfully challenged @entity1 's anti-gay - marriage constitutional amendment in federal court @entity1 voters approved a state constitutional amendment banning the practice in 2008 , a year after @entity0 left the governor 's mansion			1
but four months ago a federal judge ruled that the @entity54 @entity53 considers that move an illegal form of discrimination			1
@entity0 said little six years ago about the ballot initiative that temporarily enshrined male - female unions as the only legal ones in his home state , but held the position that a state law banning gay marriage was sufficient			1
his position seemed to evolve in 2012 when he told @entity66 that gay parents could be considered role models			1
but ' traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned ' by governments , he added			0
' if people love their children with all their heart and soul and that 's what they do and that 's how they organize their life , that should be held up as an example to others , because we need it , ' he said then			0
and in a 2014 speech , @entity0 warned that the @entity85 should n't allow itself to be seen as ' anti-gay			2
' some of that rhetoric neatly mirrors what other @entity85 have said as they have appeared to soften their earlier hard line against gays walking down the aisle			0
but the states ' - rights position , an @entity94 campaign consultant told @entity8 , is ' a band - aid approach that will – maybe – give conservatives just enough reason to hold their nose and vote for a @entity0 or a @entity99 if one of them emerges as the 2016 nominee			1
' @entity99 , the @entity103 governor , has drawn flak for cozying up to president @entity105 , particularly after the @entity106 sent much - needed relief funds following @entity108			2
mixed bag : gay marriage is legal in states shaded blue , while states marked in green have court challenges pending fractured : the @entity54 is the only nation where gay marriage rights are split along regional lines on friday , @entity118 gov. @entity117 filed a petition with the @entity54 @entity120 appealing the legalization of same - sex marriage in his state , saying that defining marriage along traditional lines is better for children			1
he also said states – and not the federal government – should have the right to decide the issue			2
same - sex marriage was legalized in @entity118 on oct. 15 after the 9th @entity131 rejected @entity117 's argument			2
he 's now requesting reconsideration			0
in @entity1 , though , the federal government has taken the reins			2
in august , judge @entity136 , decided against the 2008 @entity1 amendment but stayed his ruling until just after midnight monday night to allow for appeals			1
the @entity17 reported monday that ' both a federal appeals court and the @entity54 @entity120 turned down requests from @entity1 's attorney general to extend the stay until the appeal is heard			1
' on thursday @entity136 notified county clerks statewide that refusing to issue marriage licenses to gays and lesbians would be a violation of the @entity53 beginning on tuesday			1
future first couple ? @entity0 ( left ) and his wife @entity150 ( right ) could be the next @entity152 power couple if the former governor can avoid alienating the @entity85 's conservative base global trend : the first gay weddings in @entity157 were held on december 30 , following @entity159 's decision to grant same - sex couples an equal right to marriage @entity0 's position drew jeers from the @entity165 , which suggested his acceptance of state - level laws banning gay marriage made him an unsuitable presidential candidate			1
' so the people should have the right to enact a discriminatory law ? ' asked @entity1 @entity165 director @entity172			0
' that sounds like what he was saying			0
' ' that unfortunately is consistent from what i remember about @entity0 's tenure as governor			1
' @entity0 faces an uphill climb with the right wing of his party as he explores the feasibility of a 2016 @entity106 run			1
conservatives see him as soft on tea - party issues and have already put him in what one @entity85 @entity188 staffer called ' the @entity191 box ' on tuesday			2
' if he runs , he 's going to be the @entity191 guy this time around			0
or the @entity196 guy , ' the aide to a right - wing @entity85 @entity106 member said			0
' and we 've seen how well that turned out			0
' both @entity191 and @entity196 lost their elections to @entity105			0
@entity0 is polling in the top rungs of @entity85 contenders .			0

former @entity1 governor is expected to run for president in 2016
hopes to frame gay marriage as states - rights issue since @entity1 voters banned the practice in 2008
but a federal judge has told @entity1 county clerks they *'ll* be violating @entity53 if they do n't issue marriage licenses to gays starting tuesday
@entity0 risks alienating conservatives by not taking a firmer stand but could benefit from rhetoric *backing* position that 's already lost in court
making gay marriage a states ' - rights issue could mollify *social* conservatives while *tacitly* throwing in the towel
