@entity0 and the @entity1 will not attend the inauguration of @entity3			1
there were suggestions that the move might be seen as a snub after @entity9 president @entity8 revealed that she had asked the pontiff to intervene in her country ’s dispute with @entity13 over the @entity14			1
but a @entity16 spokesman said last night that the prime minister ’s decision to send cabinet ministers @entity20 and @entity22 to the inauguration ‘ is absolutely nothing to do with the @entity14 ’			2
miss @entity8 became the first foreign head of state to meet the new pope , formerly archbishop of @entity38 , at the @entity39 yesterday			1
afterwards , she said : ‘ i asked for his intervention to avoid problems that could emerge from the militarisation of @entity13 in the south @entity44			0
’ the @entity39 refused to comment , saying the meeting was ‘ private and informal ’			0
miss @entity8 ’s relationship with @entity3 before he was elected @entity36 was toxic , as the pair clashed over her government ’s socially liberal policies			1
but after they exchanged gifts , she said : ‘ i was so happy he invited me to meet him and that i got to eat his last lunch with him before he becomes @entity36			0
and never before has a @entity36 kissed me			0
’ after the @entity36 thanked ms @entity8 for her presents , she exclaimed ' never in my life has a @entity36 kissed me ' a gift from home : ms @entity8 presented the @entity36 with a traditional mate gourd and straw to drink tea from ms @entity62 also told reporters : ' i asked for his intervention on the question of the @entity14			1
' we want a dialogue and that 's why we asked the @entity36 to intervene so that the dialogue is successful			2
' earlier this month , the islanders voted overwhelmingly to remain a @entity71			0
it is now known how the @entity36 responded to ms @entity8 , but before he was @entity36 he has been quoted as saying that @entity13 had ' usurped ' the islands from @entity9			1
ms @entity8 also presented the @entity36 with a mate gourd - a sort of traditional tea urn - and a straw , from which he could drink his favourite @entity9 tea			2
afterwards the @entity9 leader said the @entity36 had kissed her to thank her for the gift form his native country			0
tomorrow world leaders will gather in @entity84 to attend his installation @entity85 in @entity86			1
a total of 130 delegations are due to attend the @entity36 ’s inaugural mass today , including one led by the @entity91 despot @entity90			1
the feisty @entity9 premier arrived bearing gifts for the @entity36 , before asking for his help over the @entity14 the 76 - year - old @entity95 , who was born in @entity38 , has previously clashed with the @entity9 premier over her socially liberal policies and with what he has called her government 's ' totalitarianism '			1
ms @entity8 and her predecessor and late husband , @entity103 , defied church teaching to push through sex education in schools , free contraception , and the right for transsexuals to change their official identities			0
in 2010 @entity9 became the first @entity112 country to legalise gay marriage , when the now - @entity36 was then cardinal @entity3			2
according to his biographer , he knew the church would n't win a fight against it , so he urged his bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead			0
seized her chance : the @entity9 president asked the @entity36 for help on the eve of his inauguration @entity85 in @entity84 @entity8 , left , with the @entity36 , and @entity126 vice president @entity125 , on the left with @entity129 pm @entity128 banned from travelling in @entity131 in protests at the human rights record in his southern @entity135 nation , the 89 - year - old is exempted for trips to the @entity39			1
in 2005 , @entity90 joined world leaders at the funeral of pope @entity139 @entity126 vice president @entity125 has also flown to @entity84 for tomorrow 's @entity85 , where he will represent the @entity112 delegation			1
today he was photographed reviewing the guard of honour at the @entity143 with the outgoing @entity129 prime minister , @entity128			0
after today 's meeting between @entity3 and ms @entity8 , the two @entity9 had lunch together - a meal that might have been awkward , given their long history of disagreements			1
but when the bishops shot down his proposal , the @entity150 declared what gay activists called a ' war of @entity156 ' on the measure , and the church lost the issue altogether			0
the chilly relations between the pair became apparent a few years ago when ms @entity8 and her late husband stopped attending the church 's annual @entity163 address challenging society to do better			2
souvenir makers have been busy as more than a million visitors are expected to see the new @entity36 in @entity84 in last year 's address , @entity3 said @entity9 was being harmed by demagoguery , totalitarianism , corruption and efforts to secure unlimited power : a strong message to a country whose president has ruled by decree and left scandals unpunished			1
more recently , a degree of silence was noted on ms @entity8 's normally - chatty @entity183 account when the @entity9 was elected @entity36 last week			1
she posted just one @entity183 all day , saying ' to your holiness @entity3 ' and linking to her letter of congratulations , which was n't even signed			2
@entity39 - watchers said the choice of venue for today 's meeting was unusual , given @entity3 has technically taken possession of the papal apartment in the @entity194 , where such formal audiences are usually held			1
however he has conducted all of his audiences in the hotel to date , including with one with the @entity39 secretary of state earlier today			0
rows of chairs have been laid out ahead of tomorrow 's @entity85 where @entity3 @entity3 will be formally installed as leader of the @entity203 the @entity39 said it planned no statement , describing the meeting as private and informal			1
the meeting with ms @entity8 is just a warm - up for the new pope , given the number of world heads descending on @entity84 for his installation @entity85 tomorrow			1
more than 120 official delegations will witness @entity3 's formal installation as the 266th leader of the 1.2 - billion strong @entity203			1
@entity129 media say @entity84 civil protection authorities are expecting more than a million people to attend the @entity85 , numbers not seen since the beatification of @entity221 in 2011 which drew 1.5 million to @entity222 and the surrounding streets			1
one significant @entity224 is the spiritual leader of the world 's @entity226 , ecumenical patriarch @entity225 the new @entity36 's low - key style has been evident from the start : here he waded into the crowd to meet people his presence at the installation is the first from the @entity236 - based patriarchate since the @entity203 and @entity226 churches split in the @entity238 nearly 1,000 years ago			1
also arriving in @entity84 today was @entity240 president president @entity239 , in what is a rare @entity131 foray for the head of the diplomatically isolated island that underscores the tricky nature of its relations with @entity247 and the @entity39			1
as he arrived in @entity129 he said : ' we want to have much better relations with the @entity39 and i think we will			0
' the @entity240 president said the new @entity36 was a ' wonderful person ' , adding : ' i think he 'll do a very good job			2
' @entity240 has full diplomatic relations with only 23 countries , most of them in @entity112 , @entity135 , and the @entity256			0
its only diplomatic ally in @entity131 is the @entity39 , though even that tie remains tenuous			0
the @entity39 has long expressed a willingness to transfer its diplomatic recognition from @entity262 to @entity263 , though it has made that conditional on @entity247 allowing its @entity203 to worship freely , without @entity265 restrictions			0
@entity247 has congratulated the new pope on his election , but said that establishing formal relations would depend on the @entity39 cutting ties with @entity262 and ceasing activities @entity263 considers interference in its internal affairs			0
pope @entity3 ' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a @entity39 receptionist directly and was told : ' and i 'm @entity276			2
' the new pope , according to @entity279 religious website @entity277 , had announced himself when he called a @entity282 residence in @entity84 on friday and got through to the switchboard			2
he had been trying to contact @entity284 , the superior general of the @entity36 's old @entity282 order			2
but the baffled receptionist - identified only as @entity287 - thought someone was playing a trick on him and quipped back : ' oh yes ? and i 'm @entity276			0
' his holiness eventually got through , after managing to convince the receptionist he was genuine saying : ' i really am @entity3			0
' one @entity39 expert explained : ' you ca n't really blame the poor man			0
no other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls			0
an official usually calls a secretary who places the call			0
' the receptionist is extremely distraught but i think the new pope has a good sense of humour and will laugh it off , ' they added .			0

@entity0 and the @entity1 wo n't attend the installation @entity85
seen as a snub after @entity8 approached the @entity36 about the @entity14
request came at @entity3 ' first meeting with head of state today
he and @entity8 have history of spats over her liberal policies
also arriving in @entity84 today was @entity91 president @entity90 , 89
