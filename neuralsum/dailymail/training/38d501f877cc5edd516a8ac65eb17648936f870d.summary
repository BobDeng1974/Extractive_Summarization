book of revelations : the @entity3 @entity2 is telling all about his wild life before finding @entity5 in 1990 each weekend , the reverend @entity2 takes his two million @entity7 listeners for a gentle stroll along the highways and byways of @entity12 life			1
as presenter of the family chat show @entity15 , his wit and whimsy has been likened to ‘ the aural equivalent of @entity19 ’ ; @entity20 is often described as @entity12 ’s most famous vicar — aside from the fictional central character of the @entity23 hit comedy @entity3 , also based on him			1
he also has a ‘ day job ’			0
twenty - four hours after broadcasting to the nation , the plump , bespectacled clergyman returns to the tranquillity of his role as @entity31 of @entity32 in @entity33			1
his 14th - century parish church of @entity35 has a fine ring of bells and an organ which is said to have been played by @entity39			1
nothing seismic has occurred in this backwater in the heart of @entity43 since the collapse of a landmark folly more than 60 years ago			0
but that is likely to change this week with the publication of the @entity49 ’s autobiography , @entity50			2
his 150 or so parishioners have been warned by him to ‘ brace themselves ’ , for the contents are as far removed from the memoirs of a traditional vicar as can be imagined			1
‘ i had n’t realised quite how eventful my life had been until i sat down to write about it , ’ he said this week			2
‘ the truth is , country parsons often have a more vivid past than you might think			2
’ but surely none is quite so colourful as his			2
there is the gay promiscuity and ‘ dogging ’ with men in a local layby , week - long hard drugs binges , a lost year in @entity67 on @entity68 and amphetamine , rave clubs , a suicide attempt , the deaths from @entity73 of so many friends , and his bizarre pretence over a number of years that he , too , was @entity81 positive , because he thought it made him seem more ‘ glamorous ’ on the gay scene			1
one can almost hear the smashing of dropped tea cups across @entity32			1
and if all that does n’t leave his flock agog , when he next takes evensong they might find themselves reflecting on the episode when he woke up in a warehouse with a tyre mark across his bare torso , without a clue as to how it had got there			2
in his previous life he had been the instrumentalist half of the @entity100 pop duo @entity102 , who had a @entity101 , and a number of other hits which made him millions			1
he grew up in @entity33 and his parents , who were shoe manufacturers , sent him to a minor public school where he was a chorister and , to his horror , realised he was gay			1
in his late teens he took a drug overdose , partly because in the @entity140 being homosexual ‘ was like being a paedophile now — it was a life which seemed to offer only disgrace ’			0
@entity20 moved to @entity142 where he met @entity109 , the @entity143 who became his singing partner in @entity102			1
@entity145 came fast and they had the @entity12 ’s biggest - selling single of 1986			2
but @entity2 was not entirely at ease with this sudden fame			1
he felt he was the gawky , bespectacled , musically trained geek who physically towered over the extrovert @entity151 , but was otherwise lost in his friend ’s shadow			0
friction grew , and it was against this backdrop of drug - fuelled rowing that @entity2 invented the deception which eventually drove him towards @entity5			1
the book details his pain as @entity73 swept away so many friends in the @entity100 ; he ascribes his survival to his unattractive physical appearance and crippling shyness , which stopped him taking part in the deadly promiscuity			0
day job : the vicar 's work at @entity35 in @entity32 , @entity33 , is a million miles from his old life during a @entity171 tour , @entity20 fell ill with shingles , one of the tell - tale signs of the @entity81 condition which leads to @entity73			1
he had a blood test , but before he got the results had an argument with @entity151			0
it ended when @entity2 blurted what he thought to be true at the time : ‘ look , i ’m @entity81 positive			1
’ in fact the blood test came back negative			0
but by then @entity2 admits he had come to like the horrible fiction he had created			1
in one interview this week he said : ‘ saying it got me sympathy , which i liked			2
’ but he told another interviewer : ‘ the harder part to admit was that there was a dark glamour to being @entity81 positive , there was this drama and i was drawn to that			1
’ the lie carried on for an astonishing five years , during which time he says he was ‘ too ashamed			2
i felt like such an idiot ’			0
memoir : the @entity200 ' book about his past it was only after he had found @entity5 in 1990 that he mustered the courage to tell people he had been an @entity81 fraud			1
his damascene moment came in a @entity207 at a central @entity142 church : ‘ i was pierced to the soul at that moment			0
a shutter was flung open , and light flooded in and i could see			0
’ but telling those close to him about his big lie inevitably had unpleasant consequences : his oldest friend never spoke to him again			0
‘ it was so humiliating , ’ @entity2 says			1
‘ but maybe that was n’t such a bad thing ; to be knocked off your pedestal is salutary			0
now it means i am deeply concerned with being as honest as possible			0
’ he said the @entity73 crisis and his own lie about it played a part in his conversion to @entity226			0
he saw the ‘ devoted , patient care ’ of @entity73 patients by @entity229			0
but he also recognised his own failings : ‘ @entity231 was one of the drivers that brought me to @entity5 , because i needed to be forgiven [ for ] selfishness , silliness , wildness , taking s * * * loads of drugs , being irresponsible			1
and lying about being @entity81 positive			1
’ inspired by his new - found faith , @entity2 took a theology degree at @entity242 , @entity142 , before returning to his home county where he began to seriously consider taking holy orders			1
around this time occurred the events which , as recounted in his autobiography , will perhaps jar most with the traditional wing of his church and some of his parishioners			2
having eschewed much of the available gay sex as a conflicted pop star in the @entity100 , @entity2 threw himself into a succession of casual public sexual encounters — now known as ‘ dogging ’ — as a born - again @entity229 in the late nineties			1
he explained to one interviewer who met him at his home in @entity32 : ‘ in the love of @entity259 i discovered i was not so loathsome nor so special as i thought i was			1
’ in fact he had also discovered a layby on a busy road with a wood on either side			0
‘ this place where men could meet other men and have sex			2
i ca n’t say where it is because it ’s not far from here			0
’ club scene : the vicar had a lost year in @entity67 's dance clubs ( pictured ) on @entity68 and amphetamine the location offered , he says , ‘ the perfect infrastructure for late - night debauchery ’			2
what occurred there was ‘ one of the great liberations of my life			0
having lots of casual and anonymous sex with strangers			2
’ in another interview he explained further : ‘ i was very much healed by the experience of anonymous sex with strangers in lay - bys			1
there were moments of profound intimacy with people who were dying to be intimate			0
dying for it — just being close and being able to be vulnerable and express longing			0
’ he has admitted this was n’t consistent with his growing @entity229 calling , but he would n’t repudiate having behaved the way he did then , saying simply : ‘ i had a fantastic time			2
’ in 2005 , he was ordained into the @entity43 priesthood , and now lives a celibate life , albeit in civil partnership with @entity307 , a 37 - year - old curate in a neighbouring parish			2
they met when @entity310 went to hear @entity20 preach in @entity312 seven years ago			0
@entity43 rules dictating the celibacy of ministers in civil partnership coincided with their own sex life ‘ fading away ’			0
they sleep side by side and kiss , but only chastely			0
@entity2 says there is ‘ nothing creditable in the @entity43 ’s position on gay relationships			1
the @entity43 should repent of its hostility to homosexual people and beg forgiveness for its treatment of the gay community ’			0
in the meantime , he might have to rely upon the tolerance , if not forgiveness , of his bishop			0
@entity20 is ready to be unrepentant : ‘ sex in lay - bys and telling a lie about being @entity81 might be too fruity for the @entity43 , ’ he has said			1
‘ but i ’m not going to apologise for telling the truth			0
’ one awaits with interest the views of @entity339 .			0
