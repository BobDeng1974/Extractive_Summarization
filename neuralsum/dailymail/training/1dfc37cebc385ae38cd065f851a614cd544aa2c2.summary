millions of motorists admit to driving ‘ the morning after ’ a night of heavy drinking - even when they suspect they might be over the legal limit , an alarming new @entity5 survey reveals today guzzling water is favoured by nearly four out of ten ( 37per cent ) with a hearty fried breakfast cited by one in six ( 16per cent ) , fruit juice by nearly one in ten ( 9per cent ) , aspirin by one in 17 ( 6per cent ) , going for a run by just 3per cent , the @entity31 drink and chocolate by 2per cent			1
however , the motoring group warns that many of the so - called sober up ‘ remedies ’ are ‘ urban myths ’			1
and although some doctors have indicated that these techniques may help soothe a hangover , there is no evidence that they reduce alcohol levels more quickly			0
so the @entity5 urges motorists that if they are going to drive , even early the next day , then they should not drink			1
the figures are based on responses from 19,887 adults in an @entity5 / @entity49 survey			2
the figures were released to coincide with a @entity51 anti-drink driving campaign from the aa and drinks company @entity55 @entity54			0
but more than half ( 54per cent ) of drivers do try to avoid drink - driving by agreeing a designated driver before a night out			1
drinking lots of water and eating a fried breakfast were the two favourite hang - over ‘ cures ’ used by drivers attempting to reduce their alcohol levels after a late night session the poll showed that nearly six out of ten women ( 58per cent ) were likely to nominate a designated driver before a night out drinking compared to just over half of men ( 52per cent ) but only just over four out of ten ( 43per cent ) 18 tp 24 year olds would do so compared with nearly six out of ten ( 58per cent ) of those aged 65 or over			1
@entity74 ( 40per cent ) were the least likely to agree a designated driver but the most likely to plan to use public transport or taxis			0
drivers in the east of @entity80 ( 61per cent ) and in south west @entity80 ( 60per cent ) were most likely to agree a designated driver			0
in @entity82 , where the legal drink - drive limit has just been lowered from 80mgs to 50mgs , nearly one in ten ( 9per cent ) of drivers opted for soft drink @entity31 as a alcohol - reduction measure compared with just one in every hundred ( 1per cent ) in the rest of the @entity54			2
figures in @entity82 show that of 434 failed breath tests during last week ’s four week drink - drive campaign , 10 per cent were after 6am			2
one in five of us admit getting behind the wheel next day with enough alcohol still in our system to fail a breath test			0
the ‘ drinking - lots - of - water ’ method of trying to sober up was most popular in @entity99 and south east @entity80 , said the report			1
by contrast the fried breakfast strategy was favoured most by @entity74 , those in north east @entity80 and by younger drivers			1
it also noted : ‘ some 9per cent of drivers in @entity82 opted for @entity31 compared to just 1per cent in every other part of the @entity54			0
’ @entity5 president @entity109 said : ‘ alcohol levels in the body can still mean that drivers are over the limit the following morning and we want to ensure that people are fully aware of this when they are making the decision whether or not to get behind the wheel			1
’ he noted : ‘ there are many urban myths and rituals used to try to counter hang - overs and reduce blood alcohol levels but the only save method is to drink less or give adequate time for the alcohol to leave your system			1
‘ but the same penalties , such as minimum year ’s ban , for drink driving apply the morning after as they do the night before			2
’ but mr @entity109 said : ‘ it is encouraging to see that many people are choosing to select a designated driver before a night out but it ’s really important that they also consider arrangements for the morning after too			2
@entity55 @entity54 managing director @entity136 said : ‘ it ’s clear that a lot of people are making the right choices but often they do n’t realise the dangers of driving in the morning after a night of festivities			0
’ breath test data shows that in 2013 , 3 per cent of drivers and riders failed a breath test following a reported personal injury accident			0

in that same year about 6 per cent of killed motorcyclists and around a quarter of vehicle drivers were found to be over the legal alcohol limit when they died .			0
