most want an immediate limit on how much can be gambled on roulette - style @entity2 ( @entity13 ) in bookies ’ shops , a poll shows			2

nearly three - quarters ( 73 per cent ) said the £ 100 maximum stake that can be bet on each spin should be restricted – with 60 per cent of those polled saying it should be slashed to only £ 2			1
in what campaigners say is a sign of growing public concern about the misery @entity24 cause , only 6 per cent said the current level at which customers can bet was ‘ about right ’			0
the machines , of which there are 33,000 in betting shops across the country , have been blamed for a rise in problem gambling and have also been linked to money laundering			2
they account for around half of bookmakers ’ profits but betting shop managers have anonymously told the mail of the toll they take on customers and staff			0
regular players are ‘ like zombies ’ , the managers said , giving examples of how customers could attack staff and vandalise shops when they lose large amounts of money			0
the poll , commissioned by the @entity61 , comes with @entity62 set to announce new restrictions on betting giants which may include stricter gambling limits and powers for councils to oppose the opening of betting shops			0

support for a £ 2 cap is also overwhelming			2
‘ for too long the government ’s excuse has been that there is not enough evidence to enforce restrictions on @entity24 , but this polling has revealed that the public would much rather err on the side of caution			0
