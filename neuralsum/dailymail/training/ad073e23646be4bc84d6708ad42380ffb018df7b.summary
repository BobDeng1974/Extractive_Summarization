by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 14:48 est , 2 january 2014 a couple at the centre of an international five - year manhunt over an alleged £ 1million @entity6 fraud have been arrested in @entity7			1
@entity8 , 44 , and @entity9 , 53 , are charged with eight counts of fraud and conspiracy to defraud the @entity13 , a teaching organisation			1
they allegedly moved to @entity7 after police interviews in 2008			2
the pair were only able to be arrested when they moved from the @entity19 - controlled north side of the island to @entity7 in the south			2
arrested : the pair were taken in by @entity7 police and appeared in court in @entity25 on tuesday unlike the north side , which has no extradition treaty with the @entity28 , the @entity7 does , and allowed @entity8 and @entity9 to be taken in			1
the couple stepped over the border to the @entity7 at the end of last year where they were taken into custody on a @entity34			0
the couple were flown back to @entity28 by @entity7 police and appeared before @entity36 on tuesday			1
ms @entity37 , from the @entity38 , said with a little research the couple would have discovered northern @entity7 to be a ‘ non-convention ’ country , and so has no extradition treaty with the @entity28			1
appeal on @entity44 : the pair allegedly moved to @entity7 in 2008 a @entity44 appeal to help trace the pair was made by the @entity48 in october			1
they were wanted in a joint investigation by @entity51 and the @entity6 ’s counter fraud unit , @entity53			0
@entity9 was employed by the @entity6 as an it manager from 2000 until 2009			2
he was questioned by police over claims he had interests in three it companies used to supply equipment , services and goods to the @entity6			0
the couple are suspected of being involved in a fraud that led to the @entity6 being defrauded out of more than £ 1million			0
the case has been transferred to @entity25 @entity65 for a preliminary hearing later this month			0
criminals have been able to take shelter in northern @entity7 for years thanks to diplomatic tensions over the area			2
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , dozens of criminals began fleeing there to take advantage of the fact that the @entity19 - controlled part of the island has no extradition treaty with the @entity28			1
the situation came about because the @entity28 government does not recognise @entity19 ’s claim to the land			0
the @entity19 government has offered to sign a treaty with the @entity28 , but so far the government has refused to avoid offending @entity7 or @entity86			2
fears have been raised that the situation means the area could become the equivalent of @entity92 's @entity91 in the 1970s and 1980s , where criminals would often go to escape extradition			0
authorities in northern @entity7 have said they will co-operate with @entity28 police			1
this , however , has not stopped the island being a problem			0
last year the @entity100 released a ‘ most wanted ’ list of nine wanted men who were believed to be in @entity7 , in the hope that it would help them be brought to justice .			0

@entity8 , 44 , and @entity9 , 53 , were extradited back to the @entity28
they are charged with defrauding the @entity6 's @entity13
the pair allegedly went to the island in 2008 after being questioned by police
police could only take them in after they strayed from northern @entity7 - which has no extradition treaty - to the @entity7 , which does
