by @entity1 reporter published : 19:12 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 15 july 2013 a drug used to treat diabetes could cut the risk of developing dementia by 20 per cent , a study has found			1
almost 15,000 people aged over 55 diagnosed with the type 2 form of the disease were given the drug metformin over five years			1
but when scientists looked back over medical records they found it also reduced the chances of those with diabetes developing dementia			1
drug aid : diabetes type 2 patients who had been treated with metformin ran a 20 per cent lesser risk of developing dementia in old age @entity25 , one of the most common diabetes treatments , makes the body more sensitive to insulin , which diabetes sufferers can not naturally produce			1
about 800,000 people in the @entity32 suffer from a form of dementia , with more than half being diagnosed with @entity37 ’s disease			2
@entity38 of the @entity39 in the @entity32 said : ‘ diabetes sufferers are twice as likely to develop dementia than those who do n’t have the disease anyway so this is positive news but only time will tell			1
‘ at the moment it ’s still early days and we are not sure exactly how metformin works with regard to dementia			0
‘ but what is becoming increasingly apparent is the role of insulin in the brain and the way it can regulate the brains behaviour			0
’ cause : diabetes type 2 is a is a metabolic disorder which mainly occurs in people over 40 who are overweight , and is treated with medication and diet clinical trials are now underway to establish the use of metformin as a therapy for both dementia and mild cognitive impairment , which is thought could be a precursor to alzheimer ’s disease			1
the study by scientists at non-profit medical group @entity74 , based in @entity75 , presented their findings at the @entity77 in @entity78 in the @entity79 yesterday			0
an @entity39 spokesman welcomed the research and said : ‘ the more we learn about dementia and how it relates to other conditions like diabetes , the more we ’re able to explore whether existing drugs can double as dementia treatments			2
‘ this study suggests that the drug metaformin may be one of the most promising candidates to do just that			0
‘ one in three people over the age of 65 will develop dementia			0
given the huge cost and high profile failures of developing new treatments from scratch , looking at ways to use drugs like this to treat dementia is incredibly important			2
’ experts predict dementia sufferers in the @entity32 will rise to 1million in less than ten years and could soar to 1.7 million by 2051 .			0

@entity25 found to lessen risk of dementia in diabetes type 2 patients
the drug cuts the risk of developing the disease by 20 per cent
