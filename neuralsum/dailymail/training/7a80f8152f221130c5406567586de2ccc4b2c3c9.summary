by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ the last time the @entity2 team had an aura about them was at the @entity4 in 2006			1
they were a bloody difficult team to beat			2
when that team stood in the tunnel , the opposition knew that they would be in for a game			0
there was a presence about @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and captain @entity19 when they took to the field			0
going home : @entity2 's players applaud their travelling supporters after drawing 0 - 0 with @entity25 in their final @entity4 group game bright future : @entity2 boss @entity28 believes the country 's young players can develop ahead of @entity31 final farewell : @entity2 's players were given a rousing reception by fans in the @entity35 at the 2006 @entity4 , the starting line up had 25 top level league titles between them and hundreds of @entity40 appearances - @entity12 ( 6 ) , @entity13 ( 1 ) , @entity14 ( 2 ) , @entity15 ( 2 ) , @entity19 ( 6 ) , @entity17 ( 2 ) and @entity43 ( 4 @entity42 titles )			1
@entity44 had never won a league title at the time , but he had been named @entity47 footballer of the year in 2001			0
that squad had unquestionable pedigree and a wealth of experience playing football at the very highest level			0
how @entity2 ’s head coach @entity28 could do with some of that			1
take his full strength team for the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity57 and there are only 10 @entity60 titles between them : @entity64 ( 2 ) , @entity63 ( 1 ) , @entity18 ( 5 ) , @entity61 ( 1 ) and @entity62 ( 1 )			0
it is evidence of some success , but @entity63 , @entity61 and @entity62 were not influential members of their respective teams when they won the league			0
@entity73 ’s squad was different , with powerful names playing significant roles at @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
they were serial winners with their club sides , putting domestic rivalries to one side when they pulled on the @entity2 shirt under @entity73			1
they did n’t like losing			0
solid : @entity15 , pictured here in action against @entity87 at the 2006 @entity4 , was a key part of @entity73 's defence unfortunate : @entity73 ( right ) and @entity19 ( left ) fell at the quarter - final stage in @entity92 eight years ago experienced : @entity14 and @entity13 , pictured against @entity93 at the 2006 @entity4 , gave @entity2 a solid foundation eventually they were beaten by @entity95 in the quarter - final in @entity97 , knocked out of the tournament on penalties after playing for an hour with ten men			1
they were a stubborn bunch			0
@entity2 had already qualified from the group after opening victories against @entity105 and @entity106			1
they drew with @entity107 and slipped past @entity87 before they went on to play @entity95			2
@entity2 could be beaten , like any other team could be beaten , but you would have to work hard for it			1
@entity73 ’s team played tournament football , keeping their opponents in the group games in @entity92 at arm ’s length as they made their way through to the last eight			2
it was n’t particularly attractive or pretty to watch , but @entity2 were resilient and stubborn			1
they are pre-requisites at this level			0
what @entity28 would give for that after this dismal , depressing @entity4 in @entity124			1
the top teams play on the fear factor , growing in stature and intimidating their opponents with this air of invincibility			0
on the spot : @entity132 had won titles with @entity78 before anchoring @entity2 's midfield all smiles : @entity19 and @entity15 celebrate the midfielder 's winning goal against @entity87 in the last 16 in 2006 turning point : @entity18 's red card against @entity95 in 2006 contributed towards @entity2 's exit on penalties in @entity97 @entity142 fed off it for six years , twice winning the @entity47 championships and the @entity4 while everyone attempted to catch up			1
they won a psychological war , too , convincing people that they had redefined the game and invented a new way of playing football with the principles of tiki - taka			0
their opponents believed they hype			0
@entity142 created an aura and people got carried away with the idea that they had reinvented the @entity157 they really had was a highly - talented group of players who flourished under the stewardship of @entity163 and then @entity164			2
when they were together , they ticked			0
when @entity28 reflects on a @entity4 that he admitted he ‘ under - estimated ’ before tuesday ’s final group game with @entity25 , he must revert to a more pragmatic approach			1
@entity2 will sail through a qualification campaign that includes @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 to qualify for @entity31			1
it 's over the next two years , in the slog around @entity176 , that @entity28 must carefully prepare for his third tournament in charge of the national team			1
champions : @entity142 goalkeeper @entity181 holds the @entity4 trophy aloft after beating @entity183 in 2010 repeat performance : @entity142 continued their dominance by winning @entity187 in convincing fashion since some encouraging friendly results under @entity28 , with victories over @entity192 and @entity124 ( at @entity193 ) , @entity2 ’s results have been on the slide over the past year			1
the @entity4 warning signs were there when they were beaten easily by @entity92 and @entity196 at @entity193 in the build - up to the tournament			2
draws with @entity87 and @entity200 in @entity201 felt insignificant at the time , but few believed that this squad could make an impact at an international tournament			0
when you look at @entity2 ’s defence , their most vulnerable area going into the tournament , they have little experience of playing @entity40 football			2
@entity213 duo @entity212 and @entity214 , who started both of @entity2 ’s group games , have never played in the competition			1
missing out : @entity213 defender @entity214 ( right ) has never experienced @entity40 football room for improvement : @entity2 goalkeeper @entity64 has played in the @entity40 knockout stages just once before good enough ? @entity63 ( right ) has just 18 appearances in @entity176 's elite club competition to his name with the exception of @entity227 , who won the @entity40 with @entity77 in 2012 , the rest of @entity2 ’s defence has never gone deep into the competition			1
@entity63 made 15 appearances for @entity77 and three for @entity230 ; @entity64 has made 19 for @entity231 and @entity227 also has the same number of appearances			0
to bring this team together in two years ’ time and bind them together into a formidable attacking unit will take something special			0
the first step is to make @entity2 difficult to beat again at the very highest level			2
once that has been established , @entity28 can start thinking about adding the finishing touches .			2

@entity2 only *collected* one point throughout this @entity4 campaign
@entity28 's men leave @entity124 2014 without even qualifying past the group stages
