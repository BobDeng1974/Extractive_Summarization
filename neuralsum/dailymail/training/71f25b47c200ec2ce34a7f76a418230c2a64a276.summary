accused : @entity8 who is accused of tasering to death a black ex-marine is also facing court in a brutality and racism case battered : the injuries @entity25 allegedly suffered as he was ' beaten ' by police tasered : @entity9 , pictured in his days as a @entity27 , was allegedly unarmed when he was shot by police @entity8 is also one of six police officers accused of beating two brothers as they were arrested - and describing them as ' rag heads ' in 2008 , the @entity28 reported			1
@entity32 , who is of @entity34 descent , was left with a black eye after allegedly being beaten by officers in 2008			1
his brother @entity37 was also attacked			0
the brutality case - unrelated to the death of @entity40 - is due to go before a court on april 23			1
the brothers claim they were handcuffed to a pole in a police station and beaten with batons			2
although no criminal charges were ever brought , the pair are taking action in the civil courts			0
the pair claim they did not resist arrest			0
as it was revealed that @entity8 is to appear in court , union officials called for him to get a fair hearing over the death of mr @entity40 who was shot in the early hours of november 19			1
police had withheld @entity8 's name since he fired the shots last autumn			1
he now faces an anxious wait to see if he will be indicted by a grand jury over the shooting			0
@entity9 's son @entity64 told the @entity65 : ' i ’m for ( officer ) @entity8 getting a fair hearing			1
' let the facts speak for themselves			0
but did my father get a fair hearing ? no , he ( @entity8 ) played judge and executioner right then and there			1
” the victim , who had also worked as a correction officer , died in hospital hours after he was tasered			2
at first officers said the shooting was ' justified ' as self - defence because the ' deranged ' victim had first attacked officers with a hatchet and knife			1
but , four months later , a grand jury is now being convened to look into alleged inconsistencies in the record of the involved officers ' version of events			1
victim : @entity9 , 67 , who was shot twice with a taser by officer @entity8 this is because fresh evidence , in the form of a recording from medical alert company lifeaid purporting to reveal everything said inside the apartment , has come to light			1
two videos which capture some of the incident , from a building security camera and also attached to a stun gun used by the police , have also emerged			2
lawyers for @entity107 's son , @entity106 , say police were called to the sleeping 68 - year - old 's housing project home in the early hours of the morning			1
he had accidentally triggered his @entity112 pendant and then failed to respond to calls			0
on arrival he told officers banging on his door they were not needed			0
but they heard banging come from the apartment and thought someone could be in serious danger			0
an hour - long stand - off ensued and he became more agitated as he saw armed police arriving			2
on the recording an officer is apparently heard screaming ' i do n't give a f * * * n * * * * * , open the door ' , a second yells ' i need to use your bathroom to pee ' , while others taunted him about his military background			2
claims : a chronically ill heart patient died after police officers - called to deal with a medical emergency - burst into his home and tasered him twice in the chest ( file picture ) on one of the videos , police are shown prying part of the door open			1
a metal object , which could be what police thought was a hatchet , slips through the gap and falls in the hallway			2
they remove the hinges to the door and , on entering the flat , see @entity107 standing in his boxer shorts , with his arms at his side and hands empty			0
family lawyer @entity159 , a former @entity160 assistant district attorney , told the @entity65 : ' the minute they got in the house , they did n’t even give him one command			0
' they never mentioned ' putyour hands up			0
' they never told him to lay down on the bed			0
the first thing they did ... you could see the @entity172 light up ... and you could see it going directly toward him			0
' uproar : the case is similar , some say , to the killing of @entity177 ( left ) by @entity178 ( right ) which sparked outrage because the latter has never been arrested almost 200,000 people have signed an online petition demanding justice in the case			2
@entity160 district attorney @entity186 confirmed a grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the case this month			2
the outrage follows the shooting of black teen @entity177 , 17 , who was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer @entity178 , 28 , in february			0
@entity178 claims he acted in self - defence after being sucker - punched by the teen in a gated community in @entity195 , @entity196			1
the fact @entity178 was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations			0
tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the @entity204 confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman 's criminal past , and @entity177 's history of truancy , drugs and graffiti .			0
