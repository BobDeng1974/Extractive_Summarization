by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:51 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 15:11 est , 22 january 2014 it has been revealed that two armed officers left the area where a shooter opened fire at a @entity9 airport last fall just minutes before he started his spree and killed one security screener and injured three others			1
the new details also note that the armed officers did not tell a dispatcher about their impromptu break as they are required to do			1
the @entity19 officers were outside @entity20 when authorities say @entity22 opened fire with an assault rifle in an attack targeting @entity27 officers			1
it took a call from an airline contractor to a police dispatcher , who then alerted officers over the radio — a lag of nearly a minute and a half , the officials said			1
the officials who revealed the damning details to the @entity1 requested anonymity , saying they were briefed on the shooting but were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation			1
before officers could get to the scene , @entity22 fatally wounded @entity27 officer @entity58 and then headed to the screening area where he shot two more agents and a traveler , authorities said			1
@entity22 was subdued after being wounded by officers in the gate area of the terminal			0
when the shooting started , the two officials say one of the armed officers assigned to the terminal was at or just outside an adjacent terminal			1
one of the officials said the officer was on a bathroom break and the other foot - beat officer was in a vehicle on the tarmac outside @entity20 , headed for a meal break			1
the new details about the whereabouts of the two officers come as authorities review the overall response , including whether emergency medical personnel were forced to wait longer than necessary to remove @entity58 so he could be taken to a hospital			2
the @entity1 earlier reported that @entity58 did not receive medical care until 33 minutes after he was shot			0
a coroner 's release said he was likely dead within two to five minutes			2
crowd control : it has now been revealed that two armed airport police officers were meant to be in the area at the time of the shooting but had taken unannounced breaks , leaving the unarmed @entity27 agents in the area alone departmental procedures require that officers notify a dispatcher before going on break and leaving their patrol area in order to ensure supervisors are aware of their absence and , if necessary , a relief unit can be brought in to cover their area			1
airport police union chief @entity106 said the two officers assigned to @entity20 still were in position to quickly respond to the shooting			1
he said he 'd spoken with both and confirmed one was ‘ going to the restroom or coming back from the restroom ’ and the other was headed out on a meal break but still within his patrol area			0
‘ he had n't gone on break yet			0
he was going to go on break , ’ @entity106 said			0
what typically happens is , ‘ if you 're going to go on a lunch break , you get to your location and you tell them that you 're there			0
’ officers often do this in order to maximize their lunch break so they do n't lose time while traveling			2
within a minute of the dispatcher 's call , that officer had stopped someone who ran out of the terminal and the other officer was heading toward the shooting , @entity106 said			1
mayor @entity138 told the @entity1 in an interview that he 's watched surveillance video and received briefings on the investigation			2
while officers were able to take @entity22 into custody within five minutes of the shooting , he said , ‘ it could have been a lot worse			1
’ response : the dispatcher 's alert over police radio brought an officer on a @entity153 , another on a bike , one on a motorcycle , two in a patrol car and one on foot , said one of the law enforcement officials ( pictured on november 2 ) whatever the investigation 's conclusions , @entity138 said , ‘ i want to make sure that in any terminal , there 's always somebody there , that a bathroom break does n't result in somebody , even for a few minutes , being out of the action			1
’ according to investigators , @entity22 , originally from @entity170 , @entity171 , arrived at the airport on november			0
1 with the intention of killing @entity27 workers			2
authorities have said @entity22 had a grudge against the agency , but they have not indicated what prompted it			0
after entering the terminal , police say @entity22 pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a duffel bag and began spraying the area with gunfire			1
@entity58 was mortally wounded and became the first @entity27 agent to die in the line of duty			1
the dispatcher 's alert over police radio brought an officer on a @entity153 , another on a bike , one on a motorcycle , two in a patrol car and one on foot , said one of the law enforcement officials			2
two of the first responding officers shot @entity22 , who survived and now faces murder and other charges			2
airport police chief @entity205 lauded his officers for what he called a swift and brave response to a gunman			2
he said he was ‘ comfortable with what the officers were doing at the time that the shooting occurred and their ability to respond to the incident			0
’ ‘ it 's not about who was or was not there and how that all occurred , ’ @entity205 said			0
‘ those officers responsible for that terminal were there as quick as anybody else was to deal with those particular issues			0
they were not goofing off			0
’ airports are allowed to make their own security plans for armed officers , as long as they follow basic guidelines and get their plans approved by the @entity27			1
an updated policy at @entity9 was outlined last april in an internal memo that was obtained by @entity1 and verified by one of the officials			0
officers assigned to the terminals must inform supervisors when they want to take a break			0
‘ absent exigent circumstances , ( the units ) shall not leave the assigned terminal area without prior authorization and a relief unit , ’ the memo stated			0
in an important change , officers no longer were required to remain at a podium by the screening area : in an effort to make security plans less predictable , they are allowed to roam the terminal provided they can respond to an emergency at the screening station within three minutes			0
@entity27 officer @entity253 , who works at the airport and is president of the local union , said removing the officers from the podiums at the screening stations has been unnerving for screeners			2
‘ they 're not there , and you 're saying to yourself , ' oh , hopefully nothing happens right now , ' @entity253 said			0
@entity265 , a former @entity266 agent who was chief of homeland security and intelligence at @entity9 from 2007 to 2010 , said the combination of the officers being away and the policy change gave @entity22 the soft target he wanted			1
had officers still been stationed at the screening area , ‘ that arguably would have put them in a position to know about the incident and respond to it in a much more reduced time span , ’ he said .			0

two armed officers did n't tell their dispatcher that they were going on breaks , new details from the investigation reveal
@entity32 *walked* into @entity9 's @entity20 minutes later and took an assault rifle out of his bag and started firing , targeting @entity27 agents
@entity27 agents fled the scene without hitting the panic button which would have alerted police
@entity295 learned about the shooting a minute and a half later after an airline contractor called it in , and then it was radioed over to nearby police
one @entity27 agent died - the first ever in the line of duty - and three others were injured , as well as the shooter who was hit twice by police and survived
