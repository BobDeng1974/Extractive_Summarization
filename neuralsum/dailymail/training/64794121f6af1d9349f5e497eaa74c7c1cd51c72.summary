a @entity1 woman in her 80s got the shock of her life when she found a @entity6 robe belonging to her father from the 1920s			1
the woman , who would not reveal her name was rummaging in her attic for vintage items to auction off when she found the robe			1
nobody in the family knew her father was affiliated with the @entity6			1
the white robe bears the @entity6 's distinctive round , scarlet patch with a white cross			1
for years , it sat in a bag , assumed by family members to be an innocuous garment and not a feared symbol of the white supremacist group			1
the white robe of a @entity27 from @entity28 ( pictured ) is now on the auction block @entity31 @entity30 said when the woman found it and considered selling it , she removed the patch to wash the garment			1
on the back of the patch was her father 's name			1
now tucked between children 's victorian - era button - down shoes and a @entity45 collar bag with collars , the item stands out on an auctioneer 's website touting an end - of - the - year sale			1
@entity30 , who has been in the business for 26 years , said he has never seen one sold at auction and does not know what to ask for it when the auction kicks off tuesday night			0
he already has received some bids by phone			0
' it 's not the sort of thing people would readily buy in front of their neighbors , ' @entity30 said			2
the @entity6 , a secretive society formed in the @entity64 , emerged briefly in @entity28 from about 1923 to 1925 , according to @entity65 , president of the @entity66			2
@entity65 told @entity67 that the @entity6 held a meeting there in june 1924 , when about 10,000 members from @entity1 , @entity71 and @entity72 gathered			2
@entity6 pictured lighting torches to ignite a cross during a @entity6 rally and cross burning on a hog farm outside of @entity77 in 1977 ( library image ) @entity79 , a senior fellow at the @entity80 , said the @entity6 has shrunk nationally from about 4 million at the time of that @entity28 meeting to about 4,000 now			2
there are single chapters in @entity1 , @entity85 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
@entity79 said finding a robe at an auction is fairly rare : he estimates it 's happened half a dozen times in the past 10 years or so			1
the @entity80 , a civil rights advocacy group that tracks hate groups , believes museums are better destinations for robes and other klan artifacts			0
' i think it is true that we ca n't ignore or suppress our history , ' he said			0
' we have a very racist past and the @entity6 was a part of that			2
' @entity30 said he wrestled with whether to sell an item that represents hate but , as he has done with @entity106 paraphernalia , decided the historical significance of the robe outweighed other concerns			1
' my first reaction was , ' i really do n't want anything to do with it , '' @entity30 said			0
' i find it offensive myself			0
but what we really do here is sell history			0
and the way you learn from mistakes you make is to not destroy it			0
after a little soul - searching , i decided it should be sold			0
' besides calls from potential buyers , he has gotten angry calls from people outraged that he would sell such an item			1
he is not sure what to expect at the auction			0
' i 'm hoping people will be adult about it , ' he said .			0
