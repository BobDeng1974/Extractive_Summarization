the complaints are the latest move in an ongoing campaign to win pay of $ 15 an hour and unionization for fast - food workers by publicly pressuring @entity1 's to come to the bargaining table			1
the push is being spearheaded by the @entity18 and began more than two years ago			0
already , it has included protests around the country and lawsuits alleging workers were n't given their rightful pay			0
on the job : @entity1 's workers in 19 cities have filed complaints over burns from popping grease , a lack of protective equipment and other workplace hazards , according to labor organizers ( stock image ) the burns and other hazards were detailed in complaints announced monday and filed with @entity37 @entity36 in recent weeks			1
workers cite a persistent lack of gloves for handling hot equipment and say they 've been burned while cleaning grills that have to be kept on			1
one worker says he was told by a manager to , ' put mayonnaise on it , you 'll be good			0
' the complaints also detail a lack of training for handling hot fryers and slipping on wet floors			1
a representative for the @entity54 , @entity53 , confirmed the complaints were received by @entity36 but said the agency does not discuss ongoing investigations			0
take care : workers cite a persistent lack of gloves for handling hot equipment and say they 've been burned while cleaning grills that have to be kept on ( unrelated photo ) chain reaction : the complaints are the latest move in an ongoing campaign to win pay of $ 15 an hour and unionization for fast - food workers by publicly pressuring @entity1 's to come to the bargaining table in a statement , @entity72 said the company and its independent franchisees are committed to providing safe working conditions for employees , and will review the allegations			1
' it is important to note that these complaints are part of a larger strategy orchestrated by activists targeting our brand and designed to generate media coverage , ' @entity79 , a @entity1 's spokeswoman , said in the statement			1
the complaints extend a central theme of the ' fight for $ 15 ' campaign , which has been to hold @entity1 's accountable for working conditions at its franchised locations			1
that would ease the way for worker negotiations and unionization across the company 's more than 14,000 @entity37 restaurants , the vast majority of which are run by franchisees			2
@entity1 's and other fast - food chains , including @entity104 and @entity105 's , have said they 're not responsible for employment decisions at franchised restaurants			2
the matter has reached the general counsel of the @entity111 , which said late last year that @entity1 's could be named as a joint employer in complaints by workers			1
those complaints have yet to be heard , but whichever side loses is expected to appeal the decision			0
@entity118 , organizing director for @entity119 for $ 15 , said the injuries at franchised and company - owned restaurants mostly came about because understaffing and employees being told to work too quickly - both of which he said were the result of a computer system that tracks sales and staffing metrics			0
the computer system was also cited in lawsuits last year that allege ' wage theft ' by @entity72 and its franchisees for the denial of breaks and overtime pay			0
that system has been key in the argument by labor groups that @entity1 's exerts enough control over franchised restaurants to be considered a joint employer			2
nothing unusual : @entity145 , executive director of the @entity146 , said that the burns and other hazards detailed in the complaints are ' pretty universal ' in the fast - food industry @entity118 noted that workers are looking at every way they can hold @entity1 's accountable , and that workplace injuries are just the latest issue they 're bringing to light			1
although the @entity36 complaint system does n't let workers name joint employers , @entity159 , a health and safety legal expert who was hired by the fight for $ 15 campaign , said there have been other cases where multiple employers are issued citations for the same violations			0
she said she 's not aware of any such cases involving fast - food restaurants , however			0
she said the first onsite @entity36 visits triggered by the complaints took place in the past week or so , and that the agency has six months to issue citations			0
@entity145 , executive director of the @entity146 , said in a conference call organized by labor groups that the burns and other hazards detailed in the complaints are ' pretty universal ' in the fast - food industry			2
@entity1 's , which saw customer visits at established @entity37 locations decline in each of the past two years , has been trying to reinvigorate its image			2
earlier this month , the company 's chief administrative officer , @entity187 , said a big part of the @entity37 turnaround will be what the company is doing around ' the employment image and our employee - employer relationships			0
