by @entity0 for @entity1 seven specks of stardust from outside the solar system have been brought back to @entity5 for the first time			1
these tiny grains , some of which are a millionth of a millionth of a gram , could help scientists explain how solar systems form			1
scientists believe they were created in a supernova explosion millions of years ago and altered by eons of exposure to the extremes of space			1
the largest interstellar dust track found in the @entity20 spacecraft collectors was this 35 micron - long hole produced by a tiny speck of stardust that was probably travelling so fast that it vaporised upon impact ' no one has caught stuff from outside the solar system and returned it to @entity5 before , ' @entity26 , microanalyst at the @entity27 told @entity1			1
their tiny size , meant they took six years to find			2
' for perspective , you can fit a billion of these in a grain of sand , ' he said			0
interstellar dust thrown out by exploding stars is believed to scatter the heavy elements necessary for life - such as carbon , nitrogen and oxygen - across the galaxy			1
after a life cycle of millions of years , the dust can lead to planetary formation and acts as a key component in the evolution of the galaxy , researchers claim			1
the left image shows on the interstellar dust impacts in the foil aboard the @entity20 spacecraft			1
the crater is about 280 nanometres across ; 400 of these craters would span the width of a human hair			0
the right image shows one of the specs of stardust with crystalline mineral olivine ( pink ) , made from magnesium in this sense , everyone on @entity5 is partly made from stardust			0
' they are very precious particles , ' said lead researcher dr @entity73 , from the @entity74			0

these tiny grains , some of which are a millionth of a millionth of a gram , could help scientists explain how dust clouds collapse to create solar systems			1
' fundamentally , the solar system and everything in it was ultimately derived from a cloud of interstellar gas and dust			1
' we 're looking at material that 's very similar to what made our solar system			2
' these particles , collected by the @entity20 spacecraft , are much more diverse in terms of chemical composition and structure than first thought			1
for instance , some of the larger ones had a snowflake - like ' fluffy ' structure , said the researchers , writing in the journal @entity114			1
' the fact that the two largest fluffy particles have crystalline material - a magnesium - iron - silicate mineral called olivine - may imply that these are particles that came from the disks around other stars and were modified in the interstellar medium , ' said dr @entity73			1
' we seem to be getting our first glimpse of the surprising diversity of interstellar dust particles , which is impossible to explore through astronomical observations alone			2
' @entity132 's @entity131 ( artist 's impression pictured ) was launched in 1999 to fly through the coma - the envelope of gas and dust - surrounding comet wild - 2			2
using a ' fly paper ' technique , it was designed to catch cometary dust in tiles of soft aerogel separated by pieces of aluminium foil mr @entity26 said knowing what the dust is made from , and its structure , could will help understand some of the fundamental mysteries of how dust and gas lead to star and planet formation			2
' our solar system is ramming its way through interstellar space			0
as it 's going , it collecting these grains , ' said mr @entity26			0
the dust coughed up by stars during their death throes has always been a mystery to scientists			0
but trying to analyse the behaviour of this interstellar material involves going into deep space - and up until now that has hindered efforts to understand it			0
earlier this year researchers at @entity132 found a way around this problem by designing a machine that can create interstellar dust from scratch here on @entity5			0
the device , dubbed @entity181 , could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars			2
along with the latest discovery , scientists hope they can understand more about interstellar dust and how it forms into planet and other cosmic bodies			2
' for me , the most interesting thing is that some of these little grains may tell us whether any of the dust we are seeing came directly from supernova explosions outside our solar system , ' mr @entity26 told @entity1			1
' knowing the structure and composition of the particle will help us calculate the temperatures of giant dust clouds			1
this is important because it lets you know what kinds of reactions go inside them – how they evolve , collapse , and how solar systems can form			1

a similar collector was placed on the rear of the probe to collect particles from streams of interstellar dust flowing through the galaxy			0
both collectors were dropped by parachute and recovered after @entity20 returned to @entity5 in 2006			2
volunteers with home computers , who called themselves ' dusters ' , were invited to help the professionals scan more than a million dust - track images			2
the citizen science project , dubbed @entity242 , proved critical to the needle - in - a - haystack search			0
dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets and are a key component of the universe 's evolution			1
stars are pictured here in the @entity254 scientists identified just seven particles that were likely to have had an interstellar origin			0
three either lodged or left traces within the aerogel while the remains of four others were found in pits in the aluminium foil			0
these particles were a tenth of the size of comet dust , measuring up to two thousandths of a millimetre across , and varied in composition			0
three particles from in the search contained sulphur compounds which some astronomers argue should not be found in interstellar dust			0
describing the dust residues discovered in the foil , dr @entity278 from the @entity279 said : ' they were splatted a bit but the majority of the particles were still there at the bottom of the crater			0
' their diversity was a surprise , but also these fluffy particles , sort of like a tossed salad , were complex , an agglomeration of other particles , rather than one dense particle suggested by the simplest models of interstellar particles			0
' ' the key thing is this is just the start , ' said mr @entity26			0
' we did n't really know for certain we were going to find this material … it really is breaking completely new ground			0

seven grains of cosmic dust have been captured by @entity20 spacecraft
specks may have been from a supernova explosion millions of years ago
their structure and chemical make - up is more diverse than first thought
for instance , the larger grains have a snowflake - like ' fluffy ' structure
they could help explain how dust clouds collapse to form solar systems
