five teenage girls who showed ' an interest ' in travelling to @entity2 have been barred by a high court judge from travelling abroad			1

he said the ban was a ' draconian ' step , as was the removal of the passport			0
mr @entity4 told the hearing : ' but the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in @entity2 and so many have gone knowing that would be likely			1
' as i said early this week in another case , and i repeat it in this , sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people , ultimately from themselves			0
the judge said the ban was a ' draconian ' step , but necessary to protect the girls			2
pictured : @entity58 , @entity2 ' therefore i am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought			0
' the girls and adults concerned , who were not in court today , can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish			2
the judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family			1
he also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services , and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position			1
' it seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls			0
' authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young @entity22 people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of @entity2 controlled by @entity98 militants			0
