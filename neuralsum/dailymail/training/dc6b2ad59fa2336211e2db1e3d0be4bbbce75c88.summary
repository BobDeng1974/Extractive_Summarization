by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 15 july 2012 updated : 02:01 est , 16 july 2012 work and pensions secretary @entity1 wants people to a life on benefits is not an option thousands of benefit claimants in the 56,000 households that will be hit by a new £ 26,000 - a - year cap on handouts are already looking for work , @entity1 says today			1
official figures released eight months before the @entity1 ’s restrictions come into place suggest the policy is already pushing some people back into employment			0
mr @entity1 , writing for the @entity19 , argues that thousands are finally beginning to realise ‘ life on welfare is no longer an option ’			0
he also launches a strong attack on @entity24 for refusing to back the £ 26,000 benefit cap , accusing the @entity26 of wanting to maintain a ‘ culture of dependency ’			1
data collected by the @entity30 show 1,700 claimants who would have been affected by the cap have moved into work			1
a further 5,000 have indicated they would like to receive support to find jobs			0
officials say the figures are far higher than would have normally have been expected among this high - claiming group			0
letters were sent out in may to those who could be affected by the cap , outlining intensive support that will be offered to help them move off benefits and into jobs before the policy comes into effect in april 2013			1
the figures , released as regulations to bring the new limit into force are laid in @entity53 today , show that 56,000 households will be affected by the benefit cap			1
of those , more than 29,000 have four children or more , and more than 5,000 have six children or more			0
the figures reveal that more than 7,000 families in @entity61 are currently claiming over £ 34,000 a year in benefits – the equivalent of an annual income in the higher rate of income tax of around £ 47,000			1
the £ 26,000 - a - year cap is supposed to ensure that those who are on benefits can no longer receive more in state handouts than the average salary of a working family			1
new official figures suggest a new £ 26,000 - a - year cap on handouts is driving more people back to work			1
( @entity78 picture ) however , senior @entity80 want to go further in the next stages of welfare reform			0
options being considered include a reduced cap of around £ 20,000 or regionalising benefits so that lower limits are applied outside big cities , where housing costs are higher			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ these figures show the benefit cap is already a success and is actively encouraging people back to work			1
‘ they also show that @entity24 ’s criticism of the cap was nothing but needless scaremongering and opposition for opposition ’s sake			2
officials say reforms mean those who go back to work will be better off than those who stay on benefits ‘ when it comes to the tough decisions , @entity24 do n’t have it in them to govern			1
it ’s sheer madness that people on benefits can be getting as much as a higher - rate taxpayer earns			2
we need a welfare state that acts as a safety net and encourages people back to work , not traps them in out - of - work dependency			2
’ the government has made a number of concessions to critics who warned the cap was too blunt an instrument , offering some exemptions for those on sickness benefits and giving those who have been in long - term employment for a year or more before they start claiming longer to find a new job			1
officials pointed to one example of a single parent with six children who has been on welfare benefits since august 2010 and would have been affected by the cap			1
the unnamed woman accepted a @entity139 offer of employment support , with training , and found a 16 - hour - a - week job on the national minimum wage			0
calculations show the household will be £ 100.62 better off per week , and as a lone parent she is now entitled to working tax credit and will no longer have the benefit cap applied			1
the cap will also not apply to those who claim @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 , recognising the extra costs they face			2
those who receive a @entity157 ’s or @entity158 will be exempt , and those who have been employed for 12 months or more and lose their job through no fault of their own will have nine months before the benefit cap applies to them			2
@entity166 , pictured with his wife @entity167 , says he was shocked to discover families claiming £ 100,000 a year in housing benefits today , the government will lay regulations to bring the benefit cap into law			1
it will ensure that people can no longer receive more than £ 26,000 a year in state handouts , the same as the average salary			2
the last government lost control of welfare spending , for in a decade of growth , spending on welfare rose by an enormous 40 per cent			0
spending on tax credits totalled £ 171billion in the last six years , while housing benefit nearly doubled in ten years to £ 21billion a year by the time of the last election			2
worse , @entity24 planned to let it grow to a staggering £ 25billion by 2014 - 15			0
i was shocked when i realised it was possible for families to claim over £ 100,000 a year for help with housing costs , in addition to other benefits			1
it can not be right that families on benefits are paid to live in large houses , in exclusive areas that hard - working people simply could never dream of being able to afford			0
this is unfair to the taxpayer and to those in low - paid work doing their best to maintain financial independence			0
but it also creates a huge stumbling block to those who are unemployed , who can not take the positive step into work because they fear losing their home as their housing benefit is tapered away			0
under the last government , the safety net became a cage , but today marks another step towards ending that trap			0
the benefit system should be seen as a means of temporary support for those who fall on hard times , rather than a lifestyle choice			0
despite the mess the last government left behind , as i have tried to reform the system and bring this under control , @entity24 have set about scaremongering as they opposed each and every one of our changes			0
they have objected to our work experience programme which helps young people back to work , carped at our reforms to sickness benefit and , of course , they oppose the benefit cap			2
despite all the scaremongering , research now shows that of those housing benefit claimants affected by the cap , a third said they would now be looking for a job			1
we are already seeing cases of people moving into work , and many others are seeking out the targeted support available to move into employment – all this some eight months before the cap is even introduced			2
we are witnessing a shift in behaviour as many are finally beginning to realise that a life on welfare is no longer an option			0
despite the economic difficulties , we now have fewer people economically inactive than we have had since the election , and even since records began			0
this is precisely what our reforms are designed to do : create a welfare culture that incentivises work and limits those high benefit payments so that hard - working taxpayers can feel that the system is fair to them , while bringing to an end @entity24 ’s damaging culture of dependency .			0
