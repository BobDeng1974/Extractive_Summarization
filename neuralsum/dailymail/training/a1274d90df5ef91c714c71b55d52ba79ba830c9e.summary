by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 07:00 est , 5 august 2013 a driver who apparently collided with a cyclist after a row on the road bragged on @entity5 she had ' purposefully run him over ' and was ' definitely still drunk ' at the time			2
the motorist , named online as @entity9 from @entity10 , has since apologised and says she has spoken to the @entity11 about her ' exaggerated ' comments , which were picked up by cyclists who began haranguing her			1
she wrote on saturday morning : ' just had a full on barney with a cyclist he started banging on my roof so i purposely run him over lol see yaaaaa # c * * * * ' it comes months after accountancy trainee @entity23 , 21 , boasted about having knocked a cyclist off his bike and through a hedge on @entity5 , and she has since been charged with various driving offences			1
row : tweeting under the name @entity9 , this driver said she had ' purposely ' knocked down a cyclist after a row incident : miss @entity9 claimed that as she overtook a group of cyclists , one pulled out towards her which led to an altercation ( file picture ) in this new @entity5 storm @entity39 wrote : ' i was definitely still drunk ! if there 's anything i hate in this world it 's f * * * * * * cyclists			1
' i did n't kill the poor f * * * * *			2
i knocked him off his bike but still managed to continue my journey with 1 wing mirror lol			2
' the tweets led to her getting abuse on @entity5 and also on cycling forums , where she was called an ' anti-cyclist moron '			1
but today miss @entity9 has clarified her comments and said the incident was ' not a drunken hit and run ' and the tweets were a ' stupid joke '			1
' i would like to start off firstly by apologising for any offence i may have caused other cyclists with my tweets on saturday , ' she wrote			1
' i did not intend to upset anybody			2
truth is i was joking with a friend , i thought it was a conversation between two people			2
this incident was not a drunken hit and run			0
' my comments were terribly exaggerated and made in anger after being physically and verbally attacked by the cyclist			1
' this was investigated by the @entity11 and has been resolved '			1
argument : tweeting a friend @entity39 explained how she had driven off with one wing mirror , but she has since said this was exaggerated claim : this tweet also said ' i was definitely still drunk ' and that the driver hates cyclists explaining her side of the story she wrote : ' on saturday morning at around 9am i was driving behind a group of cyclists riding 3 a breast when i attempted to overtake at a clear point			1
as i did so , a fourth cyclist also tried to get ahead of the others leading to a near collision			0
' i then shouted out of my open window ; you 're going to cause a crash riding like that			0
' the cyclist caught up with me			0
he began hammering on my roof			0
and spitting at me as he shouted through my window " what 's your f * * * * * * problem with cyclists ? ' then there was a brief collision in which nobody was hurt			1
not a " hit and run "			0
this could equally have been caused by him cycling into me			0
' i did not lose a wing mirror it was merely pushed in			0
i appreciate how my tweet may have been misinterpreted			0
' nobody was injured during the incident , there was no impact on the cyclist as he continued to scream abuse as he rode off ! ' the other individual involved has not come forward			0
@entity115 has made several attempts to contact the @entity5 user for comment and the @entity11 says it is unable to confirm the incident was reported to them			1
accountancy trainee @entity23 's boasts about having knocked a cyclist off his bike and through a hedge on @entity5 made national news			1
collision : @entity23 ( left ) tweeted she ' definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier '			0
@entity126 ( right ) , 29 , came forward as the cyclist involved in the collision and alleged he was ' lucky to be alive ' following the crash confession : this tweet by user @entity132 was met with shock and prompted an investigation by @entity137 police writing under the name @ emmaway20 , she tweeted : ‘ @entity141 knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier – i have right of way he does n’t even pay road tax ! # bloodycyclists ’			2
after police tracked her down she was charged with driving without due care and attention and failing to stop after an accident			0
she also has to answer a charge of failing to report the accident after the incident in @entity153 @entity152 , @entity137 on may 19 , and will appear in court this month .			0
