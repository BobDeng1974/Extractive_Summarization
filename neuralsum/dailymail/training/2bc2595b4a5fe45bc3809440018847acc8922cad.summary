as the @entity9 revealed yesterday , prince @entity2 has been urging doctors to release him as soon as possible and , according to one senior royal source , has been in ‘ genuinely good form ’			1

a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity2 continues to make good progress from the procedure			1
' he remains in hospital under observation and in good spirits			1
’ @entity26 , who remains at @entity27 , her private @entity28 estate , is being kept informed about her husband ’s progress			1
other royals went ahead yesterday with their traditional @entity33 pheasant shoot – normally organised by crack shot @entity2 – at his request			1
the senior royal began experiencing severe chest pains on friday night and was airlifted to @entity14 ’s specialist cardiothoracic unit for surgery on a blocked artery			1
his wife , children and grandchildren have all been to see him , although it is believed the duke did not receive any family visitors yesterday			2
dressed to impress : at her first @entity47 of @entity48 looked elegant in a simple maroon outfit by a @entity51 designer , while the @entity26 wore a lavender coat with a glittering diamond and pearl brooch on the way to the church : ( left to right ) prince @entity57 , prince @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , prince @entity61 , prince @entity62 , and @entity63 , @entity64 made their way to the service while prince @entity2 recovered @entity69 centre of attention @entity60 , flanked by @entity58 and @entity62 on either side , in her striking @entity74 hat the irascible royal hates fuss and when he was hospitalised for four days with a chest infection in 2008 he refused to receive any well - wishers , instead catching up on his paperwork			1
although it is expected that the duke will make a full recovery from his ordeal , questions were being asked yesterday as to whether he would be able to continue with his busy schedule of public engagements when he and the @entity26 return to work from their @entity90 break in early february			1
despite his age , @entity2 still undertakes around 350 engagements a year and in 2011 undertook two gruelling foreign tours with his wife – to @entity96 and @entity97			2
next year sees the worldwide celebration of the @entity99			2
she and her husband are due to undertake a comprehensive tour of the @entity51 to mark the occasion			2
surrounded ! @entity59 happily chatted as the public swarmed to meet prince @entity58 's stunning wife meeting @entity59 at @entity90 : the crowds were thrilled to greet the @entity64 brotherly love : prince @entity58 and prince @entity62 spoke to public who clustered around the church ‘ it ’s just too early to say what will happen , ’ a source told the @entity9 yesterday			0
‘ inevitably the duke will want it to be business as usual but he may have no choice but to slow down			0
’ meanwhile the @entity60 continues to enjoy her first @entity90 as a royal			0
all eyes were on @entity60 as she attended church at @entity27 for the first time on christmas morning – and as always , critics were poring over her choice of outfit			0
she won praise for the eye - catching , plum made - to - measure @entity74 hat she wore for the occasion			0
delighting the crowds : @entity59 accepts some flowers from a young girl festive gift : her majesty receives flowers from well - wishers following the @entity138 church service @entity90 as a married couple : prince @entity58 escorted his stunning wife to the church and although the newly - married duchess has her pick of priceless jewels to choose from as a female member of the royal family , she opted for £ 1,900 diamond and citrine earrings – thought to have been a @entity90 present			0
the earrings were by @entity152 - based @entity151 , whose designs were once worn by @entity60 ’s husband prince @entity58 ’s mother , the late @entity154 , @entity154			0
the duchess completed her look with a pair of vertiginous black suede heels by @entity159 designer @entity158 , made especially for the occasion			0
a spokesman for the family firm , founded in @entity163 , said : ‘ they were a special request from her office			0
’ @entity60 paid the full price of £ 169 for the shoes , as her staff said she was unable to accept gifts christmas morning : members of @entity172 , including @entity61 and the @entity64 , arrive at church today for the private mass where they received communion			0
