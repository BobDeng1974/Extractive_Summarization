taking a stance : openly - gay @entity2 ceo @entity1 criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate @entity2 ceo @entity1 has spoken out against two new laws in @entity7 and @entity8 which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on ' religious liberty '			1
@entity1 condemned the laws , saying they were ' very dangerous ' , went against the founding principles of @entity17 , and would take the country back to the days of ' whites only ' signs in shop doorways			1
he added that , as a @entity22 , he supports religious freedom , but said : ' i was never taught , nor do i believe , that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate			1
' @entity1 , 54 , who came out as gay in october last year , made the comments in an op - ed for the @entity30			1
he wrote : ' in total , there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law			2
' on behalf of @entity2 , i 'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation			2
' these bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs , growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st - century economy was once welcomed with open arms			2
' he also addressed legislation in @entity49 that ' would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples			0
' he said such bills ' rationalize injustice ' by ' pretending to defend ' religious freedom , which actually eroding the freedoms of others			1
@entity1 drew upon his background growing up in the @entity61 in the 1960s and 1970s , during and immediately after the @entity63 when blacks were still heavily discriminated against			2
he says @entity17 's ' days of discrimination ' must remain ' deep in the past ' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company			1
he added : ' @entity2 is open			2
open to everyone , regardless of where they come from , what they look like , how they worship or who they love			0
@entity93 is also named the @entity96 , and uses the same wording as the @entity7 legislation			2
the @entity7 bill forbids the state or local government from ' substantially burdening ' a person 's religious beliefs unless that burden is ' essential ' to further a ' compelling ' government interest , and is the ' least restrictive ' means of achieving that aim			1
it allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them , and if the court rules in their favor , allows reparations , including compensation payouts			0
@entity7 's religious freedom act says that the state and local government ' may not substantially burden a person 's right to the exercise of religion ' unless that burden is ' essential ' to furthering a government interest			1
it will be up to the courts to decide what counts as ' substantial ' , but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies			0
for example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony			0
supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states , and were actually signed into federal law by @entity145 in 1993			0
but opponents , including @entity1 , claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue it will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes ' substantial ' , but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it , mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate			1
@entity1 is far from the only one opposing the new law in @entity7 , with musician @entity164 , and actors @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 all speaking out against it			1
the @entity170 , @entity171 , the @entity172 , and @entity173 issued a joint statement saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination			0
@entity177 also messaged to her three million @entity179 followers saying that ' we should n't discriminate against people because of who they love ' following the bill 's passing on thursday			0
businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation , threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest			0
website @entity190 also announced plans to cancel a $ 40 million expansion to its @entity195 headquarters because of the new law			0
' @entity190 is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents , ' the company 's ceo @entity197 said in the statement			0
@entity206 founder and ceo @entity205 also announced on @entity179 that he would no longer send employees or customers to @entity7			1
proud : @entity1 said that , being born a baptist , he supported religion , but added : ' i was never taught that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate ' ( @entity1 pictured centre at gay pride parade in @entity216 ) making a statement : @entity1 previously expressed opposition to the new laws in @entity7 and @entity8 on his @entity179 page @entity1 's op - ed came after thousands gathered outside the @entity82 on saturday to rally against the law , waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as ' no hate in our state '			1
since the law passed , @entity230 senator @entity230 has robustly defended it , saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against ' government overreach '			1
he also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law , which is due to take effect in july , telling @entity239 with @entity240 , that ' the law will stick			0
' @entity230 said there was a ' tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding ' surrounding the legislation , forms of which are already enshrined in law in 20 other states			0
@entity230 told the @entity251 he will support legislation to ' clarify ' the controversial law , and expects it to go before the @entity254 this week			0
while he did not discuss the wording of the new bill , he has previously said the intention of the law is to block government intervention in matters of conscience , rather than allowing people to discriminate against others .			2
