by @entity1 reporter published : 08:16 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 22:07 est , 14 may 2012 @entity3 's latest campaign gambit follows a familiar line of attack as it uses @entity7 's private equity past to cast the @entity9 candidate as greedy , job - killing corporate titan with little concern for the working class			1
the president is not the first of mr @entity7 's opponents to try and paint the former governor of @entity17 as a heartless uber - capitalist - even his @entity9 rivals used the same tactic during the heated primary battle			2
but mr @entity3 's campaign seems to have been particularly unoriginal - as his attack ad is almost identical to one produced by @entity24 for his @entity26 campaign against mr @entity7 in 1994 , featuring unemployed workers complaining about @entity28 , the firm founded by mr @entity7			1
the timing of the @entity3 assault on private equity is also unfortunate , as on monday night the president attended a fundraiser hosted by @entity34 supporter @entity33 , chief operating officer of the @entity35 , which is believed to be the world 's largest private equity firm			1
scroll down for the video lost jobs : @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) are both featured in the @entity3 ad about @entity28 's role in the closure of the gst steel plant in @entity47 in 2001 at work : mr @entity7 was one of the co-founders of @entity28 , a private equity firm that specialized in consulting mr @entity3 is opening himself up to criticism with the attack ad , given how similar it is to the message put out by mr @entity7 's other opponents over the years - but the message has proved effective in the past , as it goes right to the heart of the candidate 's much - touted business credentials			1
the same message - that mr @entity7 is concerned only with profits and not with the well - being of those people whose jobs he cut - was echoed by his gubernatorial competitor @entity65 in 2002 , and then even by his @entity9 opponents @entity67 and @entity68 earlier this year			2
familiar face : one of the men who lost his job at the hands of @entity28 who was shown in senator @entity24 's 1994 attack ( above ) tells a similar tale to those in @entity3 's ad at the center of the @entity3 camp 's push - the president 's most forceful attempt yet to sully @entity7 before the november election - is a biting new tv ad airing on monday that recounts through interviews with former workers the restructuring , and ultimate demise , of a @entity90 , @entity47 , steel mill under the @entity9 's private equity firm			1
‘ they made as much money off of it as they could			2
and they closed it down , ’ says @entity41 , a steelworker for 30 years			2
@entity42 , who also worked in the industry for three decades , adds : ‘ it was like a vampire			2
they came in and sucked the life out of us			2
’ the ad , running for an unusually long two minutes , will air in five battleground states : @entity106 , @entity105 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			0
the campaign declined to describe the size of the ad buy though it 's in the middle of running a $ 25million , month - long ad campaign in nine states			0
a longer version of the ad was being posted online monday			0
the commercial will be coupled with a series of events mr @entity3 's campaign is holding this week in @entity122 , @entity47 , @entity106 , @entity123 and @entity124 to highlight mr @entity7 's role at @entity28 , a company he co-founded			1
it 's unclear whether mr @entity3 , himself , will criticize his @entity9 rival on the subject when the president appears at events in @entity131 on monday or whether he 'll leave the skewering to campaign surrogates as he prepares to meet with foreign leaders during the @entity136 and @entity137 summits later this week			1
also this week , vice president @entity138 holds two days of events in @entity105 , where he 's expected to discuss mr @entity7 's role as a corporate buyout specialist			2
under fire : the ad focuses on @entity28 's work with @entity145 beginning in 1993 , and eventually the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001 lasting impact : about 750 workers lost their jobs , and were left without any health benefits and reduced pension the @entity7 campaign did not comment on the ad early monday			0
the former @entity17 governor was spending the day in @entity156 , with no public events scheduled , after delivering a commencement speech in @entity108 on saturday			2
mr @entity3 's new ad , which reprises criticism leveled at mr @entity7 during the @entity9 primaries , focuses on one of those unsuccessful companies , @entity145			1
@entity28 was the majority shareholder in @entity145 beginning in 1993			0
the company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2001 , which was a period in which the @entity169 steel industry was roiled by a flood of cheap steel imports			0
about 750 workers lost their jobs , and were left without any health benefits and reduced pensions			0
the federal government was forced to infuse $ 44million into the company 's underfunded pension plan			0
@entity28 received $ 12million on its $ 8million initial investment and at least $ 4.5million in consulting fees , according to a january report by @entity180			0
mr @entity7 has accused mr @entity3 of attacking free enterprise and called the criticism of his business background an attempt by @entity34 to distract voters from the president 's record			1
both candidates were entering a new week in the campaign seeking to shift the focus back to voters ' no. 1 issue - the economy - from social issues that dominated after the president announced his support for gay marriage			2
the two campaigns contend that in a nation where unemployment is hovering around 8 per cent , voters will choose between mr @entity3 and mr @entity7 based on economic arguments			1
@entity3 is trying to convince voters to stick with him as he heralds an economic rebound , as sluggish as it is			1
mr @entity7 counters that mr @entity3 has had enough time , and only he - with his deep background in business - knows how to jumpstart the nation 's job market			1
mr @entity3 , hosting his first campaign rally earlier this month in @entity212 , @entity105 , gave a preview of the new line of attack , saying mr @entity7 had ‘ drawn the wrong lessons ’ from his business experience at the helm of @entity28			1
commencement speaker : mr @entity3 addressed the graduates of @entity221 while on a trip to @entity131 today business savvy : mr @entity7 has based the large part of his campaign on his business experience , arguing that it gives him a unique position to help fix the economy ‘ he does n't seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary - whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union - busting - might not always be good for the average @entity169 or for the @entity169 economy , ’ mr @entity3 said then			1
mr @entity7 , a multimillionaire , left @entity28 in 1999 to run the @entity237 but maintained a financial interest in the company after departing			0
driven : mr @entity7 kept a financial stake in the firm after he retired he has said that his firm had a strong overall track record , creating jobs in prominent companies like @entity246 and @entity247 , while acknowledging that some companies @entity28 invested in were unsuccessful			0
mr @entity3 's new ad , which reprises criticism leveled at mr @entity7 during the @entity9 primaries , focuses on one of those unsuccessful companies , @entity145			1
@entity28 was the majority shareholder in @entity145 beginning in 1993			0
the company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2001 , which was a period in which the @entity169 steel industry was roiled by a flood of cheap steel imports			0
about 750 workers lost their jobs , and were left without any health benefits and reduced pensions			0
the federal government was forced to infuse $ 44million into the company 's underfunded pension plan			0
@entity28 received $ 12million on its $ 8million initial investment and at least $ 4.5million in consulting fees , according to a january report by @entity180			0
the commercial shows interviews with former workers at the @entity90 plant who said @entity28 's role led to job losses and slashed benefits			0
it intersperses their claims with clips of @entity7 promoting his business background and empathizing with the jobless during campaign events			0
there also are images of a closed factory , run - down buildings and a road sign that says ‘ @entity290			0
’ inspecting : mr @entity7 spoke with @entity124 senator @entity291 on a foundry tour in @entity293 consulting : mr @entity7 's time at @entity28 , a private equity firm that he co-founding is coming under question ‘ @entity28 walked away with a lot of money that they made off this plant			1
we view @entity7 as a job destroyer , ’ said steel worker @entity296			0
@entity303 , a senior adviser to mr @entity3 's campaign , said mr @entity7 wants to ‘ create the illusion that somehow his experience equips him to lead the economy but there 's nothing about the record that would support that			1
’ ‘ his central premise is that he 's an economic wizard who can really get this economy moving and if that 's the only claim he is making for this office , that 's a premise worth examining , ’ mr @entity303 said			0
during a commencement address at @entity221 , a private women 's college , president @entity3 urged the graduates to fight for their place at ' the head of the table ' and help lead a country still battered by economic woes toward brighter days			1
@entity3 said ' i believe that the women of this generation will help lead the way			1
women , young people and gay voters all made up crucial voting blocs for mr @entity3 in the 2008 election			1
and with the president locked in a close race with @entity9 rival @entity7 , his campaign is focused on rallying support among those groups once again			2
the president 's choice of @entity221 as his first commencement address of the spring underscored the intense focus both candidates have placed on women			2
an @entity347 - @entity346 poll conducted earlier this month showed mr @entity3 with a sizable advantage over mr @entity7 with women voters , 54 per cent to 39 per cent			1
mr @entity3 acknowledged that today 's college graduates are entering a shaky job market			1
but to those who say overcoming the nation 's challenges is n't possible , @entity3 said : ' do n't believe it			1
' he told the graduates that if they ever despair , they should think of the country 's history and what young generations before them have achieved			0
' young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in from @entity362 to @entity363 to @entity364 they did n't just do it for themselves , they did it for other people , ' mr @entity3 said			2
' that 's how we achieved women 's rights , that 's how we achieved voting rights , that 's how we achieved workers ' rights , that 's how we achieved gay rights , that 's how we 've made this union more perfect			0
