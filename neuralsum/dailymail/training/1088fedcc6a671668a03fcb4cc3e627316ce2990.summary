the @entity13 , according to a tv documentary , were determined to have his know - how and not let him fall into the hands of the @entity38			1
both the @entity13 and the @entity39 tried to recruit @entity4 ’s scientists after the war to help with their own space and military programmes			1
but it is claimed that @entity0 ’s record was so monstrous that his death had to be faked and he had to have a new identity			2
‘ the whole history of suicide is staged , ’ said @entity49 historian @entity48			0
‘ there are several documents that clearly demonstrate that @entity0 was captured by the @entity13			2

the history books say that , one day after the @entity68 surrendered on may 9 , 1945 , he either shot himself or took poison in the former @entity3 city of @entity110 , now @entity111 in @entity84			2
his body was never found			0
‘ this whole story of suicide was staged by two of his closest aides who were committed to him , ’ @entity48 tells @entity113 in @entity3			2
at the war ’s end @entity13 , while taking part in the punishment of many top nazis at the @entity121 , also launched the covert @entity124 – the secret exit of top @entity68 scientists			2
@entity113 says in the documentary : ‘ sources say that @entity0 was captured by the @entity13 and interrogated by the @entity128			1
the secret service man responsible was @entity130 , a personal confidant of allied supreme commander general @entity131			0
’ police officers call for stretchers amid the damage cause by a v - 2 bomb attack on @entity135 , @entity136 the sons of the secret service man told programme makers that their father was in charge of the @entity3 weapons expert after 1945			1
one of them , @entity143 , said : ‘ this engineer brought a special treasure from the @entity68 into the @entity13			0
he offered modern weapons for us			0
‘ it was put to my father that he should bring this “ useful ” @entity3 into the @entity13 to prevent him from falling into the hands of the @entity38 intelligence service			0

@entity16 general @entity0 was head of construction and *defence* projects
he planned forced *labour* factories at @entity80 and secret v - 2 rocket plants
