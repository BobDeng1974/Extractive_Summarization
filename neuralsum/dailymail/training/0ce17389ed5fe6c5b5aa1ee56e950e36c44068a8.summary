low calorie champagne contains the same amount of alcohol with almost half the calories of a regular glass as a style editor with over 30 years experience in the fizz - guzzling fashion industry there 's not much that @entity9 does n't know about champagne			1
one things she does know is that she does n't actually like the decadent drink all that much			0
' it reminds me too much of all those dreaded press launches i had to go to when i first started out in magazines , all those over made - up pr ladies with lipstick on their teeth and slightly skew - whiff hair - dos and so forth … ' the 53 - year - old @entity19 journalist told get the gloss when they asked her to review the latest skinny champagne to be causing a stir			2
' i do n't like champagne , or " poo " as we used to call it in the early 90s , but with the dilemma of maintaining one ’s , um , girlish figure and being a highly functioning alcoholic			2
what to do , what to do ? ' red wine gives one red veins , white wine is just too clichéd for words ( do n’t even talk about rose it ’s way too fattening ) , so really there is only one alternative left … and that is champagne			2
' @entity45 generally contains around 100 calories per glass			1
the ' dosage ' is the sugar added at the end of fermentation to ' finish ' the @entity45 and 12 - 17 per cent sugar is standard			1
whilst low sugar , and therefore low calorie , fizz is not a brand new idea - some of @entity60 's most prestigious brands offer extra dry versions of their biggest sellers - it usually comes with a hefty price tag that even regular champagne drinkers find hard to swallow			1
now a new kid on the posh plonk block , created by @entity19 ex showbiz journalist @entity68 , is offering a guilt - free alternative at half the price			2
@entity68 , now a @entity60 wine expert trained at @entity72 in @entity73 , says she was inspired to create a low - calorie drink after her previous job as a showbiz reporter made her worry about gaining weight from attending vip parties			1
working with champagne maker @entity80 she has created the no sugar @entity82 , which is now selling via her @entity84 and @entity85 website for £ 49 per bottle and contains just 60 calories per glass			1
the drink is described as ' high end @entity90 with almost half the calories ' - which sounds like the holy grail for thirsty fashionistas and showbiz hounds doing the rounds			1
@entity97 editor @entity9 and her fashion friends put the latest brand to the test @entity68 said : ' we know that the @entity19 have a history of loving champagne , but in today ’s more calorie - conscious market , i ’ve found a producer who delivers a deliciously dry champagne , but with no added sugar			1
‘ the fashion crowd especially loves the idea of drinking fizz with less fat			0
’ so what is the verdict ? @entity9 says : ' i seriously think it is going to be the new thing			1
part of the reason i ’ve never liked champagne is the sick - y breath it gives you straight afterwards			2
there ’s also the stonking headache you can get the day after if it ’s not super , super expensive			0
but here ’s the thing			0
because this @entity127 champagne is so very , very very brut , you do n’t get the sickly sweet taste and nor do you wake up feeling you need to take the whole day off or you seriously might die			2
more importantly it is less calories than a single shot of vodka			0
' we had it last night at dinner and although it might not have been quite butch enough for my friend @entity138 , us ladies , we loved it , got p * * * * d on it and woke up perfectly able to cope with the new day			0
' does that sound like a champagne for the ladies ? like that beastly despicable marketing campaign by @entity147 to make “ comfortable ” pink and purple pens “ just for her ” ? well , it should n’t			0
forget my friend @entity138 , it is perfectly robust enough to serve at the most manliest of dinners , with the considerable upside of not making one ’s breath smell like vomit			0
' does n’t the idea of ‘ @entity160 ’ for women kind of make sense given that it ’s been clinically proven that we can not biologically keep up with men on the alcohol front ? and another thing			0
i ’m tub - thumping here , but with the mounting evidence that sugar is actually the crack cocaine of the 21st century , i think we should all — man , woman , rough - haired terrier — be cutting down wherever we can			0
' @entity68 gave up her carrier as a tv journalist to study in @entity73 as a wine expert and has now launched a new sugar - free @entity45 , ' @entity180 ' @entity181 , the @entity183 's food and drink blogger , agrees that lower calories are generally better all round , but is n't sure it works for this extravagent drink : ' obviously it is fantastic to have low - calorie champagne but the important thing with something as delicious and luxurious as champagne is that you are not compromising on flavour			1
' @entity196 champagnes can be so dry that they taste almost sour			0
if you are watching your calories , it might be one of those situations where you are better off having one glass of something fabulous rather than two glasses of something that does n't taste great			1
however , if this can tick both boxes , it is clearly worth buying - particularly if champagne is your aperitif of choice			0

' low dosage ' products have same amount of alcohol but *40* calories per glass less than standard champagne
showbiz reporter inspired to create *affordable* version after too many vip parties
