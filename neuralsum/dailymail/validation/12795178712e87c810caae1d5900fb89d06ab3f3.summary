@entity1 has already begun flying its giant drones designed to bring internet access to the world , @entity0 has revealed			1
' as part of our effort to connect the world , we 've designed unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky , ' he posted on his @entity1 page			1
' today , i 'm excited to share that we 've successfully completed our first test flight of these aircraft in the @entity15			2
' @entity0 revealed the final design will have a wingspan greater than a @entity18 but will weigh less than a car			1
it will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time			2
@entity1 aims to use a mix of solar - powered aircraft and low - orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard - to - reach locations			2
the drones , flying at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres ) , will be capable of staying in the air for months			2
they are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			0
the drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on @entity47			0
low - orbit and geosynchronous satellites , which have orbits that match the @entity47 ’s rotation and are effectively stationary , will cover more remote areas in @entity53 and @entity54			1
the internet access would be transmitted in the form of free - space optical communication , or @entity58 , which transmits data using infrared laser beams			0
' the final design will have a wingspan greater than a @entity18 but will weigh less than a car			1
' it will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time			0
' ' aircraft like these will help connect the whole world because they can affordably serve the 10 % of the world 's population that live in remote communities without existing internet infrastructure			2
' at @entity1 's f8 conference in @entity82 , the firm 's @entity1 's chief technology officer @entity79 revealed the firm thought drones were key to getting connectivity around the world			1
' this basically mean going to the sky , ' @entity79 says			0
he showed off the @entity88 , an @entity90 - connected unmanned drone with the wingspan of a 737 and the ' mass of a small car			0
' at a summit in @entity96 earlier this year , @entity1 's engineering director announced the vehicles will be closer in size to jumbo jets , than traditional drones , and they 'll soar at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres )			1
following the tests , it could then be just three to five years until the super-sized , solar - powered drones are hovering above remote parts of the world to provide internet access			1
@entity106 , engineering director of @entity1 ’s @entity107 , told the @entity108 that the planes will be ‘ roughly the size ’ of a @entity114 , but much lighter than the popular aeroplane , which weighs around 600,000lbs ( 272,155kg ) without passengers or fuel			2
@entity1 previously said the drones will be ' relatively cheap ' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			1
the @entity122 - based tech giant has joined forces with @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called @entity130			0
@entity1 has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world			1
drones as large as jets are set to extend the reach of @entity138 around the world			1
they will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet ( 19,800 metres ) above the ground today , around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet , which is just one third of the global population			0
the members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is ' one of the fundamental challenges of our time ' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies , including drones			2
' the final design will have a wingspan greater than a @entity18 ( pictured ) but will weigh less than a car , ' said @entity0			1
' when people have access to the internet , they can not only connect with their friends , family and communities , but they can also gain access to the tools and information to help find jobs , start businesses , access healthcare , education and financial services and have a greater say in their societies			0
' they get to participate in the knowledge economy , ' the report said			0
a recent study by @entity179 found that the internet is already an important driver of economic growth in many developing countries			0
expanding internet access could create another 140 million new jobs , lift 160 million people out of poverty and reduce child mortality by hundreds of thousands of lives			0
in terms of how this could be achieved , mr @entity189 has previously explained that @entity1 is ' looking at a new type of plane architecture			0
' the drones are set to fly at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres ) , because this altitude is a point where winds are at their lowest			0
it 's also above commercial airliners , and even above the weather , and this means the drones will be able to safely stay in the air for months at a time			1
‘ these planes are solar - powered and they sit there and circle around , and have the ability to broadcast internet down			0
’ @entity1 ’s founder and ceo @entity0 announced in march that the social network ’s @entity107 was building ‘ drones , satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone ' the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful signal that covers a city - sized area of territory with a medium population density , according to @entity130			1
the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful @entity223 drones will be tougher and able to fly for longer periods of time than balloons , while also being able to have their location precisely controlled			1
in march this year , @entity1 acquired @entity15 drone maker @entity229 for an estimated £ 12.5 million ( $ 20.2 million )			2
the company is run by chief engineer @entity231 who has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun.			0

@entity1 's drones are set to soar at 60,000ft for months at a time
have a wingspan greater than a @entity18 but will weigh less than a car
they will provide web access to remote areas of the world
the crafts will be as large as @entity18 jet liners , but much lighter
are being *trialled* at a *secret* location in the @entity15
