the controversial hike would go ahead despite the prime minister 's warning that the increase would be ' completely unacceptable ' @entity4 are likely to incur public fury with an inflation - busting ten per cent pay rise next year – an increase supported by the new head of @entity11 's expenses watchdog			1
the plan will see annual pay rise from £ 67,060 to £ 74,000 , as predicted by @entity14 in may last year			1
but @entity15 , who took up his post as chief executive of the @entity18 in june , insisted : ' it is not an excessive amount of money at all			1
' he is reported to have said the controversial hike would go ahead despite the prime minister 's warning that the increase would be ' completely unacceptable '			1
mr @entity15 said politicians should not be paid a ' miserly amount ' for their important job and their salaries needed to ' catch up ' with their counterparts overseas			1
but the proposal is likely to meet with outrage at a time when public sector workers ' wage rises have been capped at one per cent			0
in an interview with @entity36 , mr @entity15 said : ' this is an important job , the job of an mp			2
they are there to represent us all , to form laws , to send young people to war			0
it is not an easy thing to do			0
we want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly			0
' now , that 's not paid in excess but it 's not being paid a miserly amount either ... ' it 's our job to reach the judgment of what the right amount is			2
there are lots and lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that - so it is not an excessive amount of money at all			1
' @entity4 are already due a one per cent increase to £ 67,731 next april , and under @entity18 's plan is will rise again a month later to £ 74,000			1
the watchdog has said it will conduct one further review of the pay rise after the election - as it is legally obliged to do - but mr @entity15 made clear its conclusions were unlikely to shift			1
' we were allowing for any change in economic circumstances , ' he said			0
' at that time we had only just emerged from recession , it was n't quite clear we were going to have the growth that we have got now as a country , so we left the option open to change the position			0
' as of now , september , it does n't look like there is any major economic factor that would change the determination that we reached in 2013			0
' he added : ' @entity11 as a whole has created an independent body to set @entity4 ' pay			1
we have gone through the process in a really rigorous way			0
it is not an arbitrary figure that we have come up with			0
' obviously , it is for parliament to decide whether they want to take back responsibility for setting their own pay			2
i do n't believe that 's right			0
' this is the number that we 've come up with and we talked both to the public and to mps about it			0
but if @entity11 wants to change its mind and to change our remit then that 's clearly for them			2
' mr @entity15 - whose own £ 120,000 salary is £ 10,000 more than that of his predecessor - insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent @entity18 following through on its proposals			1
another potential block to the pay rise was removed over the summer , when @entity18 chairman sir @entity129 was reappointed for another 18 months - meaning he will remain in post after the general election .			2

increase is supported by the new head of @entity11 's expenses watchdog
@entity15 said it is not an ' excessive amount of money at all '
@entity141 would go ahead despite prime minister saying it is ' unacceptable '
@entity4 are already due a 1 *%* pay bump in april next year - to £ 67,731
