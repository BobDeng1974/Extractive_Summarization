@entity1 coach @entity0 has defended his players following criticism of their behaviour during sunday ’s @entity6 final win over @entity7			1
wicketkeeper @entity8 came under fire for his send - off of @entity13 opener @entity11 , and a photograph of @entity8 and all - rounder @entity14 mocking @entity16 after his dismissal cast a shadow over the @entity20 ’s fifth @entity6 triumph			1
@entity8 clapped in @entity11 's face after the @entity7 batsman was bowled during the final but @entity0 insisted @entity8 was following team orders			1
and he was able to cite the @entity26 ’s failure to censure his team as evidence that they had n’t gone over the top			1
‘ he ’s copped a bit , has n’t he ? ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ no one got reported out of the game , so we must have played it fair			2
it was a little bit disappointing , but people are entitled to their opinions and you ’re going to have good and bad times			2
you accept that and you move on			0
‘ we ’re happy with the way we played , obviously			0
we knew we wanted to be really aggressive against them , and look , sometimes it works , sometimes it does n’t			0
’ @entity16 ( left ) was also given a less - than - sporting send - off by @entity8 and @entity14 ( second right ) boorish behaviour on sunday cast a shadow over the @entity20 ’s fifth @entity6 triumph but @entity51 ’s @entity50 , who is part of the @entity26 ’s umpire selection panel , has added his voice to the chorus of criticism aimed at the @entity20			1
‘ i was very disappointed at some of the behaviour in cricket ’s showpiece event , particularly from the @entity20 , ’ he said			0
‘ watching it on my tv , and as a president of a local league , i know what will happen : this will be repeated in leagues across the land , because the players will think it ’s macho			0
’ meanwhile , @entity26 president @entity72 has resigned after falling out with his colleagues			0
@entity72 , a @entity74 , had labelled the @entity26 the ‘ @entity81 ’ after his side ’s quarter - final loss to @entity77 was marred by questionable umpiring , and was barred from presenting the trophy at the @entity80 on sunday .			1
