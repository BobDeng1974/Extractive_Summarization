by @entity0 and @entity1 less than a week before @entity4 's meets up with comet @entity5 , images taken by the spacecraft have revealed remarkable new features			1
the latest images were taken by @entity9 , the spacecraft 's onboard scientific imaging system , on the july 25 , at a distance of around 1,950km ( 1200 miles )			0
one image shows the coma , which is the dust and gas envelope that grows around its nucleus as the comet moves along its orbit and progressively closer to the sun. this image shows the nucleus of comet @entity22 from 1,210 miles ( 1,950 kilometers )			1
one pixel in this image corresponds to approximately 120ft ( 37 metres )			0
the bright neck region between the comet 's head and body is becoming increasingly distinct as @entity4 approaches and its view improves another reveals that the comet is far more irregular in shape than anyone first thought			1
it has already been named the ‘ rubber duck ’ in space			1
' our coma images cover an area of 150 by 150 square kilometres ( 90 by 90 square miles ) , ' said @entity41 from the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			0
most likely these images show only the inner part of the coma , where particle densities are highest			0
scientist expect that @entity51 's full coma actually reaches much farther			0
in the current image , the hazy , bright , circular structure to the right of the comet 's nucleus is an artefact of the @entity9 optical system			1
the coma of comet @entity5 as seen with @entity9 covers an area of 90 miles ( 150km ) across			2
this image was taken on july 25th , with an exposure time of 330 seconds			0
the hazy circular structure on the right and the centre of the coma are caused by overexposure of the nucleus images of comet @entity5 taken on july 14 , 2014 , by the @entity9 imaging system aboard the @entity4 spacecraft have allowed scientists to create this three - dimensional shape model of the nucleus the centre of the image located around the position of the nucleus is overexposed here			1
one pixel in this image corresponds to approximately 120ft ( 37 metres )			0
the image also reveals some surface features of the 4km ( 2.5 mile ) - wide comet , from a few troughs and mounds to the previously - noted bright band around the ‘ neck ’			1
its nucleus has a collar - like appearance of the neck region , which appears brighter than most parts of the comet 's body and head			2
earlier this month , remarkable photos have showed that its target , @entity5 is actually what is known as a ‘ contact binary ’			2
this means it is likely two comets stitched together , in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse			0
it could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second			0
stunning images of the comet @entity4 is heading towards were released last month			1
shown here , they reveal that the comet previously thought to be a single object actually has two parts			2
how these two parts came to be is not known , but more information will be gleaned in the next few months a contact binary occurs when two celestial objects , such as asteroids or comets , slowly move towards each other until they are touching			0
the slow approach of the two means they will form a single - oddly shaped body , rather than rebounding of one another			0
nine near - @entity130 objects are known to be contact binaries			0
however , it is estimated that as many as 15 per cent of all near - @entity130 asteroids more than 650 feet ( 200 metres ) in size are actually contact binaries			0
what is certain , though , is that it poses some intriguing problems for @entity4			2
the most notable will be the planning landing of the @entity141 probe on its surface in november			1
this will be the first cometary landed ever attempted - but now a decision will be made on what part of the comet to land on			0
regardless , @entity4 is still planning to enter orbit around the comet on wednesday 6 august			1
the orbit will gradually be lowered to 19 miles ( 30 kilometres ) once the gravitational field of the comet is known - which could be more odd than expected given its shape			1
according to @entity141 navigator @entity158 , ‘ navigation around such a body should not be much more complex than around a nucleus of irregular spherical type			1
’ but , he adds , ‘ landing the @entity141 probe , however , could be more difficult , as this form restricts potential landing zones			1
’ the images taken by @entity4 reveal a two - lobed comet rather than the single comet expected			1
this could make a planned landing in november by the @entity141 probe more difficult			1
@entity4 is due to enter orbit on 6 august after ten years of travel , when more will be known about the comet speaking to @entity172 , astrophysicist at the @entity174 and part of the team analysing results of the @entity4 mission , said : ' @entity51 does seem to be made of two lumps			1
' on one hand this is unexpected , because the shape model we had based on observations from @entity130 did n’t predict a binary structure			0
that just highlights the importance of these missions - they tell us more			0
' on the other hand , three of the five comets previously visited by spacecraft seem to be composed of two chunks too , so it could be that binary comets are quite common			0
' now we need to find out what this is telling us			0
is this a result of the way comets form , or is it a consequence of their evolution ? ' hopefully , @entity4 will point us to the answer			2
the @entity205 , where this comet is believe to originate , seems to have a very high fraction of binaries , up to 30 per cent depending on where you look , which is also interesting			0
' it could be that many of these objects start out as binaries			0
' in terms of the landing , i think the binary shape just raises more interesting questions			2
' where do we land so that we maximise the science return ? technically , it probably does not change much			0
the landing will be challenging no matter what			0
' the @entity4 spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet @entity5 ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
it will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august , becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet @entity4 will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			1
the probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity130 and @entity247 to line it up with its final destination : @entity250 – @entity251			2
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity4 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity254 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
@entity4 will enter orbit around the comet in august , before putting its @entity141 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
while in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet 's composition , which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar system and discover the origin of comets			2
@entity4 has been firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it 's hurtling towards the comet			1
there will be a total of four before @entity4 comes within 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) of the comet in early august , beyond the orbit of @entity247			1
the final rendezvous will require two more precision maneuvers			0
the probe , launched a decade ago , will spend time observing @entity286 before dropping a lander called @entity141 onto its icy surface in november			2
if the @entity141 lander is successful it will become the first vehicle ever to land on a comet			0
the comet is about 2.5 miles ( four kilometres ) long and orbits the sun every six - and - a - half years			2
once at the comet @entity4 will follow it on its journey around the sun , performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface			1
the spacecraft 's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit , bringing it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet			0
in november of this year the @entity141 lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet			2
here , harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings the comet is heading towards the sun , so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more			0
even though it is still more than 370 million miles ( 600 million kilometres ) from the sun - more than four times the distance between @entity130 and sun - its surface has already started to warm , causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock - ice nucleus			2
as the gas escapes , it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space , which slowly expands to create the coma			1
the warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises , and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail			1
this will give @entity4 some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet 's emissions and find out more about its composition			2
@entity4 and the comet will be closest to the sun in august 2015 , when they will be between the orbits of @entity130 and @entity247			1
on 25 feb 2007 the @entity4 spacecraft returned this stunning image of @entity247 as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet			1
the picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the @entity141 lander at a distance of 620 miles ( 1,000 kilometres )			0
below the solar array an area close to the @entity362 region is visible on the planet 's disk			0

one image shows the coma , which is the dust and gas envelope that grows around its nucleus as the comet moves along its orbit closer to the sun
another reveals that the comet is far more irregular in shape than anyone first thought . it has already been named the ‘ rubber duck ’ in space
could make a planned landing on the comet in november more difficult
@entity4 probe is due to enter orbit on 6 august after ten years of travel
