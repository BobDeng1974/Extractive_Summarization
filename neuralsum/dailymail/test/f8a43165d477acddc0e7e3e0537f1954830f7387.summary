a @entity1 state trooper who did what millions of hip - hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with @entity5 was told he has '' deficiencies indicating need for counseling '			1
@entity10 trooper @entity9 posed for the photograph with @entity5 at @entity12 in @entity13 after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech			1
spears , who is based out of the state 's @entity18 office , posed for the photo at the rapper 's request			1
@entity16 ' bosses at @entity10 saw the posting and then cited him , according to the @entity41			2
the official reprimand read : ' while working a secondary employment job , trooper @entity9 took a photo with a public figure who has a well - known criminal background including numerous drug charges			1
' the public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the @entity52			2
' the counseling advised @entity16 to say no when people ask for a picture with him			0
@entity5 has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted			2
since @entity9 was only reprimanded with counseling , @entity10 does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper can not appeal			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity65 said on wednesday : ' @entity10 does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in @entity69 and 411.0072			0
' supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis , and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department			0
' the counseling advised @entity16 to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that 's about it attorney @entity82 is representing @entity16 and covering the case on his blog			0
he wrote : ' @entity10 claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline , therefore the employee has no right to appeal			0
' yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper ’s chances for promotion or advancement			0
' so it appears that @entity10 commanders are papering @entity9 ’s file with counseling incidents because they ca n’t prove that he violated any law , order , or policy , and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal			1
' @entity104 is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at @entity10			0
it seems the @entity10 has a problem with @entity5 but @entity13 police seem okay with him			2

@entity10 trooper @entity9 was disciplined last week
the trooper posed with @entity5 after rapper 's @entity12 keynote speech
@entity5 posted picture to @entity35 with the caption : ' me n my deputy dogg '
rapper 's past legal problems were cause for *concern* for @entity9 ' *superiors*
he was cited for ' deficiencies indicating need for counseling ' for photo with figure who has ' criminal background including numerous drug charges '
