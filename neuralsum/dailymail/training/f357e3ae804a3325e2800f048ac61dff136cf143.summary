by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 10:32 est , 9 august 2012 @entity1 - all ? statins have had no effect on @entity5 's heart disease rate , study claims statins are not the best way to prevent heart disease , according to new research			1
the cholesterol - lowering drugs are taken by seven million people in the @entity5 , costing the @entity13 £ 450million a year			1
conventional medical wisdom states they are a good ' cure - all ' treatment for heart disease , but making dietary changes could be a more effective tactic , say scientists			1
professor @entity21 , of @entity22 in @entity23 , said statins are an effective treatment for many people with heart problems , especially if they have already had a heart attack or stroke			2
however , this accounts for only a small amount of patients who are actually prescribed statins			2
the majority are given to people seen to be ' at risk ' of the disease			1
professor @entity21 says it is very difficult to predict who is at risk			1
he told @entity42 that cost was the biggest driver to prescribe statins to people at lower and lower risk from heart disease			1
he said : ' statins are cheap and fairly safe			0
the costs of the drugs are as low as £ 1.30 a month compared to £ 24 a month a few years ago			1
' however , the cost from heart disease for hospital admissions , investigations , stents and bypasses is huge			1
' he added to @entity59 : ' for people with no family history of heart problems and others deemed a low risk , other approaches should be used , like eating a good diet full of fish , lean meat , vegetables and low in saturated fat			1
' he is one of the experts who has taken part in a documentary due to be released in september , called ' @entity74			2
' the director @entity75 claims the benefits of statins are routinely exaggerated and that the pharmaceutical industry is partly to blame			0
he told @entity42 : ' creating a drug is a costly and lengthy process so they are encouraging more patients to take existing drugs			0
' mr @entity75 worked for four years as a personal trainer and nutritional coach before writing the book ' $ 29 billion reasons to @entity88 ' in 2009			0
he said he made the crowd - funded documentary because he believes doctors are being provided with too much information that favours the drugs industry			2
however , professor @entity94 , from the @entity95 , contested this saying : ' the most commonly used statins are off patent , which means the drug cmopanies no longer have any financial incentive in expanding the market			0
' it is the medical community who is pushing for wider use of statins since they are convinced by the evidence this will reduce heart attacks and strokes in the future			0
' mr @entity75 also pointed to a 2008 study by @entity114 in @entity115 , which found the heart disease rate did not decline between 1994 and 2006 in men aged 65 to 94 yet high cholesterol levels dropped by 40 per cent			1
he added that average cholesterol levels in the @entity5 are low when compared with the rest of @entity121 , yet the @entity5 has one of the highest rates of heart attacks mr @entity75 said : ' i hope that the film will prompt more people to ask their doctor questions like : if i take this cholesterol medication , how much longer might i live ? ' this question is important because most people will not receive life extension from statins			2
' he added that negative side - effects of statins were not given enough prominence			0
however , @entity138 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity95 , said : ' statins are now a very important part of the lives of millions of people and play a vital role in both lowering cholesterol and helping prevent heart attacks			1
' their importance should n’t be underestimated and the potential risk of side effects are outweighed by the proven benefits			0
the use of statins is the main reason why fewer people have high cholesterol levels now compared to 20 years ago			0
' your body will always make cholesterol so if you stop taking a statin it ’s likely your cholesterol levels will rise			0
so , if you ’re prescribed a statin make sure you take it every day because they ’re most beneficial when you take them on a long - term basis			2
if you develop side effects see your gp as the medicine or dose can be changed			0
' but she added : ' it ’s worth remembering though that you may be able head off the prospect of being prescribed statins by eating a healthy balanced diet , keeping physically active and maintaining a healthy weight and body shape			0

@entity13 spends £ 450million a year on cholesterol - lowering drugs
most are prescribed as a preventative measure for heart disease , however experts admit they find it difficult to predict who is at risk
