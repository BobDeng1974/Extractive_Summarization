@entity0 is sick of women being made to feel guilty for having a baby ' too late ' at some point in the past few years , for me at least , @entity4 has really become the @entity6			1
it 's a notion that inspires guilt and regret in those of us over 40 as we are pummelled daily in the press for ' leaving it too late ' and panic for those in their 20 's and 30 's , regularly admonished to forgoe both financial and emotional security in order to have babies immediately , in particular by successful , insanely wealthy television presenters who did nothing of the sort			1
for women in the thick of it , it 's getting to be rather ugly			1
regularly patronised by ( predominantly male ) doctors and lectured by smug married , financially well off mothers who offer unsolicited advice â€“ fertility just is n't fun anymore			1
additionally , i think the words that most of us associate with fertility with are other @entity33 words , like failure or fear			1
the failure to establish a stable relationship with a man who also wants children in his early 30 's ( which by the way is almost none of them ) or the failure of your body to do what you always believed it could do			2
as a first time mother at 40 , i understand these feelings all too well			2
having your fertility tested , prodded , talked about and analysed at the same moment you are passionate about having a baby is utterly terrifying , no matter what your age or challenges			1
as an older woman who wants to get pregnant it is especially unpleasant			0
you are often made to feel as if you did something wrong			0
you know what ? you did n't			0
life and opportunities happen the way that they do for some of us and some things are simply out of our control			0
that is , if you believe in creating a child with someone you love , who is stable and emotionally involved , which i did			0
as i headed like an unstoppable bullet train towards 40 , fertility became the word i most dreaded reading in newspaper headlines , most of which were heralding yet another new study outlining yet again how the odds were stacked against me			1
the sad truth of the matter though , as it is with most unpleasant realities , these things ca n't really be avoided ; they exist whether we like them or not			0
and whilst it 's undeniable that there is a lot of fear surrounding this word ' fertility ' , waiting to develop courage to tackle it is just another form of procrastination			1
as someone once said , the most successful people take action while they 're still afraid			0
next week is @entity100 aiming to help couples who are trying to get pregnant and so , if you 're like me , @entity100 , kicking off october 27 - november 2nd is something you approach in equal parts scepticism and trepidation			1
from what i can gather , the thinking behind it is well intentioned			0
it 's a week - long endeavour offering both men and women information geared to help increase understanding of fertility issues , which affect one in six couples in the @entity115			1
@entity116 , chief executive of the @entity117 @entity115 , says , ' almost everyone will know someone who has experienced difficulties conceiving , which hopefully will encourage people to support the week			0
' there are some good resources available , if you know where to look			0
it 's not all hype and it 's not all bad news			0
and so , if you are someone for whom the word fertility has taken on a particularly unpleasant connotation , perhaps it 's time to gently nudge yourself back into the conversation			1
three of the @entity115 's top female fertility experts are getting involved			1
and their voices are worth listening to			0
for the first time ever , mini-clinics will be offered free of charge to the public , giving women and men the chance to ask questions and gain insight into fertility options during the week , the @entity115 's leading fertility expert and ' eat yourself pregnant ' author @entity151 is taking questions and offering advice at @entity154 , @entity155 locations all around @entity157			1
for the first time ever , mini-clinics will be offered free of charge to the public , giving women and men the chance to ask questions and gain insight into fertility options			1
these mini-clinics will cover all aspects of fertility : including the role of nutrition , fertility mots and ivf information , as well as prepping for @entity172			1
in honour of the event , @entity173 will be designing a @entity151 ' fertility juice ' , ( from ' eat yourself pregnant ' ) and 50p from the sale of every @entity179 will go to the @entity117 , the @entity115 's leading infertility support network			2
to get dates and times contact @entity181 or @entity183 @entity151 says , ' my aim is to bring fertility awareness to the high street through consultation , in an environment where women and men can have their questions answered by me and my team of experts			1
' @entity151 's clinic , under the leadership of the renowned fertility expert dr @entity194 has one of the highest ivf success rates in the world , if that is bit of a push			2
launching october 31st , @entity205 author @entity204 's new e-book , ' fertility to @entity208			2
' @entity204 says , ' a major part of what i do as a practitioner is to support couples through fertility treatment ; giving the patient some fine - tuning with acupuncture , helping the body and helping to create a calm mind			2
' i know that food and thought are two of the core pillars that underpin a foundation for health			0
the process of going through @entity172 provides it own challenges and there is much you can do to support that process through preparation and during @entity172 treatment itself			0
' @entity204 outlines a healthy eating plan that assists with natural conception as well as a week by week diet for those going through the @entity172 process , available from october 31 on @entity238			0
@entity239 in @entity240 is doing a fertility retreat with fertility specialist dr @entity242			2
the author and expert will offer those attending the 21 - 23 november course information on how to improve their chances of getting pregnant naturally			0
@entity242 , who wrote the best - selling getting pregnant faster says : ' i see so many couples in my clinics struggling to conceive , it 's always satisfying to help individuals better understand their bodies and what factors can affect their fertility , ensuring they are in the best possible shape to conceive			2
' whether we like it or not questions and issues surrounding fertility are here to stay			2
the announcement this week that some companies are going to pay for female employees to freeze their eggs merely proves that these conversations are just beginning			0
when asked about overcoming fears on the road to finding success , @entity269 once said , ' decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it			0
' that 's what i 'll be doing during @entity100 anyway .			1

@entity0 is sick of the stigma that surrounds fertility
she says that it is often a subject that inspires guilt and regret in women
she hopes that @entity100 will help to change that
