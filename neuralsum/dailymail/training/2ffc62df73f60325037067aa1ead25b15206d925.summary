former brewery boss @entity0 , pictured , has blamed the increasing size of @entity4 's @entity3 population for the growing rate of pub closures a @entity8 peer , who is a former brewery boss , has claimed that the closure of many @entity4 pubs is partly due to an increase in the size of the country 's @entity3 community			1
lord @entity0 , who is a former director of pub chain @entity16 , said pubs are closing in areas with growing @entity3 communities			1
speaking in the @entity20 , @entity0 said : ' twenty - five years ago , the company of which i was a director would have operated probably a dozen pubs in @entity24 , the home of the carpet trade			1
the carpet trade has gone and there are three pubs left			0
' in areas of @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 the increase in the @entity3 population who do n't drink leads to many pub closures			1
' it is exceptionally hard for a publican who has put 10 years of his life into trying to build up a business to accept the inevitability of these tides of history			0
' he said the issue was one of the three main reasons pubs were going out of business , along with the ' inexorable rise of regulation ' and the availability of low price alcohol in supermarkets			2
he added : ' the reasons for closure may be portrayed as rapacious owners increasing rent wishing to profit by turning pubs into houses or corner stores , but the tide is running against the ordinary pub. ' lord @entity0 said there was a danger companies would not invest in improving pubs if landlords could opt out of tied arrangements			1
' no pub owner is going to invest many thousands of pounds , hundreds of thousands of pounds in some cases , if the tenant can then walk away from supplier agreements , ' he said			0
he said removing the tie would remove the ' ladder ' by which many people could become self - employed landlords			0
lord @entity0 criticised a @entity82 decision allowing pub tenants to opt - out of agreements with their landlords to provide beer			1
he said he was disappointed that the government will not seek to overturn their @entity82 defeat			0
the defeat happened after mps backed a cross-party amendment to the @entity93			0
lord @entity0 said pubs are under threat in areas such as @entity34 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity35 business minister @entity97 said the government would accept the principle of the amendment and include it in the legislation in a workable fashion			1
however , leaders of @entity4 's @entity103 criticised lord @entity0 's comments			2
@entity105 , director of @entity106 , an organisation which is inter-faith and anti-extremist , told the @entity108 : ' it is quite ridiculous to blame @entity3 for the closure of pubs when in fact the consumption and marketing of alcohol has also changed over time			2
what is also clear is that some pubs have been successful and others have not been able to generate customers and clients			0
' @entity121 , of the @entity122 added : ' it is surprising and disappointing for @entity0 to scapegoat @entity3 for the failure of his business			2
what next ? muslims to be blamed for a fall in pork scratchings sales ? we have come to a stage where it is easy for those in prominent positions to make their points at the expense of @entity3			0

lord @entity0 said pubs were closing in areas like @entity32 and @entity34
he claimed growing @entity3 populations were *threatening* the pub trade
the peer *warned* that low - cost alcohol in supermarkets was a problem
