homeowners and shopkeepers are to be given the right to protect themselves against burglars and robbers			0
they will now be allowed to use reasonable force if they perceive a threat to their property			1
previously they could act only when they feared for their lives			0
the surprise proposal is a response to public outrage over cases such as that of @entity17 , the @entity19 farmer who shot a burglar dead , and @entity21 , who chased and beat a man who had held his family at knifepoint			0
the proposal comes after criticism over cases like those of @entity17 , left , and @entity21 it is one of a series of reforms unveiled by @entity33 in a sharp turn to the right on law and order			1
as well as more life sentences there will be tougher punishments for knife crime			1
@entity42 were quick to condemn the package , especially the pledge for mandatory life sentences for those committing very serious offences twice			1
the prime minister finally scrapped controversial proposals to halve jail terms for offenders who enter early guilty pleas			1
making a point : prime minister @entity33 proposed a raft of new measures at a press conference yesterday grilling : the prime minister was repeatedly asked about the u-turn on sentence reduction other measures include : mr @entity33 and justice secretary @entity60 attempted to deny they were making a u-turn , insisting previous @entity64 policies had merely been ' proposals '			1
slapped down : justice secretary @entity60 , leaving the cabinet meeting , saw his plans scrapped but in reality , yesterday 's package marked not only a rowing back on sentence discounts following a public outcry , but a complete shift of tone and a bid to restore the @entity77 ' reputation on law and order			1
the prime minister 's intervention was a crushing blow for both mr @entity60 and deputy prime minister @entity83 , who chaired a cabinet committee that signed off the reforms			0
the father of murdered schoolboy @entity87 welcomed the about - turn , but called for the justice secretary to be sacked			2
@entity91 said : ' @entity60 does not know what is going on in the streets , he does not know what criminality is about			0
' the justice secretary now has to find £ 130million a year in extra savings , with deeper cuts likely for the probation services and courts			2
after a series of policy u-turns , the prime minister claimed abandoning 50 per cent sentencing discounts was a sign of confidence , showing the government was prepared to listen			0
the ' weak thing to do ' , he claimed , was to keep ' ploughing on ' even when it became clear there was a better way of doing things			0
' being strong is about being prepared to admit you did n't get everything right the first time , you are going to improve it and make it better , ' mr @entity33 said			1
' my mission is to make sure that families can feel safe in their homes and they can walk the streets freely and without fear			0
the public need to know that dangerous criminals will be locked up for a very long time			0
' we want prisons to be places of punishment with a purpose , instead of prisoners setting in their cells			1
we will require them to work hard and reform themselves			2
' the self - defence clause is likely be added to the sentencing bill over the next few months			2
justice secretary @entity60 's proposed cuts to the legal aid budget will have a greater impact than feared after his department admitted making an error in its impact assessment			0
mr @entity60 's plans to cut the £ 2.2billion - a - year budget by £ 350 million are now expected to cost 66,200 legal representations a year , almost 50 % more than the original estimate of 45,000 , the @entity143 confirmed			1
the proposals , which will also cost 500,000 instances of legal assistance , have been met with widespread opposition , with actress @entity152 adding her voice to the calls for mr @entity60 to think again			0
@entity155 , head of legal aid at the @entity157 , said : ‘ it 's surprising that on a matter as important as how many people will be denied help in the future , the @entity143 should make such a mistake			2
‘ clearly the fact that over 66,000 people who have been helped with complex legal proceedings would get no help under the government 's plans is an issue of major importance			1
’ the error was made in a calculation and an updated impact assessment will be published alongside the justice bill			2
guidance to police , prosecutors and the courts will be revised to give clarity about when it is sensible to prosecute			0
they have previously had to decide what constitutes excessive force by using legal precedent			2
amending the law in the way mr @entity33 suggests would make it clear that using force to defend property , as well as the person , is reasonable			1
exactly what constitutes ' reasonable force ' remains to be clarified			1
with 23,000 violent crimes against householders every year , campaigners say the case for a change to legislation is growing ever stronger			0
the tough sentencing rules would mean predatory violent and sexual attackers who carry out a second serious offence will face a mandatory life term			1
the ' two strikes and you 're out ' policy , first proposed by @entity207 in 1997 , will mean the most dangerous criminals automatically receiving a life term after a second offence			1
senior @entity42 expressed their unease			1
lord @entity212 , co-chairman of their parliamentary home affairs committee , said it would be a ' very strange thing ' for mandatory life sentences to be imposed in cases other than murder			1
and @entity42 justice minister @entity220 said : ' the longer i have been in this job the more convinced i have been we should rely on the discretion of a well - informed judge rather than @entity226 trying to second - guess the judiciary			1
' mr @entity83 yesterday claimed he had never supported the shorter sentences policy and appeared to blame mr @entity60 for the fiasco			2
he called the original plans ' arbitrary ' and sources close to him insisted they had been ' badly sold ' to voters			2
yesterday 's announcement that those who use ' reasonable force ' to protect their families will not be prosecuted follows growing resentment of a justice system that is seen as favouring burglars over victims			1
there have been several notable cases of homeowners being jailed for defending themselves against intruders			0
the most recent high profile one is that of millionaire businessman @entity21 , 54 , who in december 2009 was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for attacking a knife - wielding burglar who threatened to kill his wife and family at their @entity252 home			1
both businessman @entity21 , left , and farmer @entity17 provoked public outcry when they were jailed his case provoked nationwide fury when he and his brother were imprisoned for injuring career criminal @entity260 , while the convicted burglar was allowed to walk free			0
but a month after being send down , @entity264 's top judge released mr @entity265 from @entity266 after changing his term to a suspended sentence			2
lord judge said his decision came because of the exceptional nature of the case and the public outrage it has provoked			0
however , the most famous case to date is that of @entity17 , a @entity19 farmer , who in 1999 shot two burglars in the back - killing one - after allegedly having his property raided on ten previous occasions			0
he was first convicted of murder and later manslaughter following an appeal			0
nevertheless , he became a cause célèbre for the homeowner rights movement and helped galvanise support for a change to the law			0
he was released from jail for good behaviour in 2003 .			0
