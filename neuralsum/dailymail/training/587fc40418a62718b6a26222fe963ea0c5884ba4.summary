by @entity0 a simple handshake could reveal the true age of a person , new research has revealed			0
scientists have discovered that hand - grip strength correlated with known markers of ageing , including disability , mental decline , recovery time after hospital treatment and death			1
the team from the @entity15 in @entity16 , believe a ' handshake test ' could be used as a viable test for biological age			0
a simple handshake could reveal a person 's age , a new scientific study has found ' hand - grip strength is easily measured and data on hand - grip strength now can be found in many of the most important surveys on ageing worldwide , ' said dr @entity29			1
the research , published in the online journal @entity32 , reviewed findings from more than 50 studies looking at people of all ages from around the world			0
it found that higher grip strength corresponded with indicators of younger biological age in different population groups			2
co-author dr @entity43 , also from the @entity15 , said : ' we found that based on this survey , a 65 - year - old white woman who had not completed secondary education has the same hand - grip strength as a 69 - year - old white woman who had completed secondary education			1
' this suggests that according to hand - grip strength characteristic their ages are equivalent and the 65 year - old woman ages four years faster due to lower education attainment			2
' a team at the @entity15 in @entity16 have found a direct correlation between hand - grip strength and known markers of ageing including disability , mental decline and recovery time after treatment in hospital previous research has shown that simply measuring the number of years people have lived does not provide an accurate picture of biologically how old they are			1
dr @entity43 added : ' our goal is to measure how fast different groups in a society age			0
' if some group is getting older faster than another , we can ask why that might be and see whether there are any policies that could help the faster ageing group			0

study *underway* at @entity15
@entity16 scientists have found hand - grip strength helps determine age
