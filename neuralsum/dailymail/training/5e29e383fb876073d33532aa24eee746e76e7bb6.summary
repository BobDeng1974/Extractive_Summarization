by @entity1 reporter a bumbling arson suspect is feeling the burn after he appears to have set himself on fire while trying to burn down a building in @entity6 last week			1
adding significant insult to the clumsy injury is the fact that it appears that this is the second time the alleged firebug has failed to burn down the same building , a @entity13 in @entity14			1
and not only did the ham - handed flame - thrower set himself on fire while failing to burn down the temple , video of the entire humiliating incident was recorded by surveillance cameras - and released onto the internet by authorities looking to track down the culprit			1
surveillance cameras recorded the unidentified suspect drive up to the temple , get out of his vehicle and walk towards the building			0
shortly after the suspects walks towards the building , a burst of light is seen coming from the side of the @entity13 as the suspect is seen scampering away			0
bad aim : the suspect apparently was not satisfied with his first attempt to set the building on fire try , try again : after missing his target , the man goes back for the flaming brick to try again to set the building on fire when the fire appears to burn out , the suspect is seen running towards the building , apparently to try again			1
when he backed away , the man 's hand appeared to be on fire			0
he then jumped in his car and drove off			0
police in @entity14 say that fire officials determined that the suspect had used a patio brick with a burning rag attached to it to break a window at the temple on the north side of the building			2
the rag , officials say , was found on the lawn			0
bad idea : after his second attempt to torch the building , the man appears to set himself on fire see ya : after failing to burn the building down - and setting himself on fire - the bumbling firebug ran back to his car and drove off still standing : authorities say the suspect did about $ 300 in damage to the building in what appears to be his second failed attempt to burn it down at the end of the day , the failed flaming brick did about $ 300 in damage			1
authorities say someone attempted to set the same temple on fire on may 14			2
an investigation is ongoing to determine who attempted to set the building on fire , and whether the two attempts are related .			0

the clumsy firebug attempted to burn down a @entity30 in @entity6
just a few weeks earlier , someone - *potentially* the same *wannabe* arsonist - failed to set the same building on fire
after throwing a flaming brick at the building , and apparently missing his target , the man tries to **retrieve** the brick
when he attempted to **retrieve** the brick , the suspect appears to set himself on fire before *fleeing*
in all , the temple sustained about $ 300 in damage
