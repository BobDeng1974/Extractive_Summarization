few teenagers could call on the help and advice of an @entity4 regular and @entity6 winner when they were flung on the @entity8 scrapheap			2
but when @entity11 midfielder @entity10 found himself released from then top - flight @entity12 at 19 - years - old and suddenly stranded in the @entity13 at @entity14 , he had a familiar name to turn to			1
words of wisdom from brother - in - law @entity18 , ignored early in his career , pulled @entity10 from the depths of non-league football oblivion			1
@entity11 midfielder @entity10 ( left ) says @entity18 was his inspiration to make it as a professional the 25 - year - old is now on the verge of playing in the @entity6 , with @entity11 top of the @entity28 , and will test his early potential against top - flight opposition @entity30 in the @entity32 fourth round on sunday			1
' one regret i have is not taking on board what @entity18 said when i was a 16 and 17 - year - old boy , ' @entity10 admits			1
' he warned me of situations that happened and i did n't listen			2
' you get put on a pedestal at a young age when you 're viewed as a promising player			0
@entity18 had seen that for years and years			0
' i was just a 16 - year - old boy who thought he was a @entity6 player			1
and i was nowhere near a @entity6 player			0
' there were certain egos at @entity12 , if young lads get in with the wrong crowd and look up to the wrong sort of player inevitably they 're going to have a bad period for a while and that 's what happened to me			1
' i was probably looking up to players that at @entity12 at that time thought they were better than they were			1
@entity18 had tried to warn me , but for whatever reason , probably immaturity , i did n't listen to him			0
' @entity10 ( right ) has since become an integral part in @entity61 promotion push this season @entity18 , so revered by his critics he was awarded the @entity63 in 2011 and won the @entity6 and @entity64 double with @entity66 in 2005 , is married to @entity10 's sister @entity67			1
the pair met when @entity18 was just 15 and staying at the @entity70 's @entity69 at @entity71			0
introduced by a mutual friend , they have been together ever since and have four children			0
@entity10 was only six - years - old at the time they met			1
none of the family knew that @entity18 would go on to win 18 @entity4 caps , captain his country and play in a @entity81			0
he grew to become the perfect example – clean - cut , respected and hard - working – to a young @entity10 , himself yearning to become a professional footballer			1
but when @entity10 debuted for @entity12 in a @entity64 against @entity85 in 2006 , he shunned @entity18 's help			1
that would be his only game for the south - east @entity91 club and after two years , and loan spells at @entity93 and @entity94 , his contract came to an end			2
no - one in the @entity96 would take him and his career was unravelling			2
@entity18 ( right ) came to prominence at @entity12 - something @entity10 failed to achieve later on in his career , @entity18 ( right ) was awarded the @entity63 in 2011 ' when i got to 19 and signed for @entity18 really came into my life football-wise , ' @entity10 explains			1
' he helped keep me motivated and try to stay as professional as i could			0
' it was probably more me opening up to him and realising i 'm in a bad position and there 's someone in my family who deep down i know i should 've listened to but i chose not to			0
' eventually once i started taking on his advice i tried to live my life similar to the way he lives his			0
i feel my career changed and i became more level - headed			2
i 'm sure he gets a lot of satisfaction out of my success			0
' @entity11 manager @entity113 has been equally as important in his progression			2
@entity113 watched just 50 minutes of @entity10 play in a match for @entity14 and saw enough to bring him to his side just promoted to @entity117 in 2010			1
@entity11 boss @entity113 signed @entity10 in his first spell in charge of the club in 2010 @entity113 left for @entity121 six months later and @entity10 struggled with different managers , but has since flourished since @entity113 returned in 2012			1
' i was seen as no 1 hate figure round here for a year or so , ' he adds			2
' the fans did n't like me			0
' eventually i turned it around and a lot of that was because @entity113 played me every week and liked me as a player			0
' @entity113 could play a man with one leg and the fans would think it was all right , they love @entity113			0
whatever he says is right with the fans , which is lucky for me			0
