by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 backed their two big bowlers to come good in the third test , and @entity5 and @entity6 stood up to be counted on a third day at the @entity7 that was almost as satisfying for their captain as the opening two			1
it is their senior players who @entity2 hoped would carry them through this transitional summer			0
they let the side down at @entity15 but on tuesday @entity5 and @entity6 joined @entity16 and @entity17 in leading the way			1
wickets were never going to come easily on an easy - paced pitch under a fierce @entity22 sun but @entity2 whittled away to leave @entity23 323 for eight , still 246 behind , with two days to try to force a priceless victory			2
scroll down to watch @entity6 discuss the days play , @entity5 partnership and @entity27 @entity5 belter : @entity5 roars with delight after dismissing his nemesis @entity30 what a way to end : @entity6 gets @entity33 ( not pictured ) just before stumps all smiles : @entity27 prepares to take the congratulations after taking the wicket of @entity38 @entity2 vowed to freshen up their pace attack in the aftermath of their second @entity42 defeat and it soon became clear that both @entity44 and @entity45 would be introduced to this @entity47 series in @entity48			1
the question was who would miss out and up until the eve of this match it seemed @entity6 would be rested here after one of his worst tests in years and with his right knee needing an operation sooner rather than later			2
thankfully for @entity2 , such thoughts were resisted , probably because @entity6 insisted he was fit for action , and this most competitive of cricketers was back to his best , at least until the demands of the day appeared to catch up with him late on			1
@entity6 said at the close : ‘ @entity64 told the senior players to go out and play like it was our first test			2
@entity68 and @entity69 were fantastic with the bat and now @entity5 and i have contributed with the ball			2
hopefully the wicket will deteriorate now			0
’ there was never any danger of @entity5 missing out here , not least because he could be suspended for the last two tests , and he was the pick of the attack as @entity23 struggled to climb the mountain that @entity2 ’s 569 for seven represented			2
it could be argued that @entity2 were too quick to ring the changes , even though they were at close to rock bottom after @entity15 , and certainly it is questionable whether leaving out @entity84 and @entity85 has improved their attack			0
the dropped pair took nine of the 20 @entity23 wickets to fall at @entity15 , even though @entity84 was poor in the first innings and @entity85 ’s problem was more with his batting than his bowling , while @entity44 and @entity45 went wicketless			0
sky high : @entity23 batsman @entity94 balloons a delivery from @entity27 into the air and is caught no substitute for class : sub fielder @entity99 ( centre ) is mobbed after catching @entity94 off @entity27 's bowling watching and waiting : @entity38 ( right ) looks aghast as he spoons the ball up in the air and is caught bat out of hell : @entity105 can not believe it after being caught by @entity16 off the bowling of @entity5 grounded : @entity105 falls to the turf after getting out of the way of a @entity45 bouncer @entity44 was dropped after two tests earlier this summer because he failed to take a wicket against @entity113 at @entity114 and there was a clamour to bring back @entity117 but the chopping and changing has not helped him settle			1
he was said to have returned to his red - ball best for @entity120 against @entity121 at @entity122 last week but here he struggled for rhythm and accuracy and left @entity16 a bowler down on another flat pitch			2
@entity45 has been a constant presence in @entity2 squads without being given many opportunities and while he has bulked up and added a yard of pace , this was far from a convincing case for permanent inclusion			0
these were hardly inviting conditions for seam , with little of the pace and bounce promised by @entity22 , but @entity45 was only able to provide a containing job			0
athletic : @entity141 dives full length to stop a straight drive @entity144 : @entity2 seamer @entity44 leaps to stop the ball off his own bowling bail out : @entity147 is bowled by @entity6 ( not pictured ) after playing on attempting to leave the ball sway out of the way : @entity147 narrowly avoids a bouncer from @entity6 that 's out : @entity152 ( centre ) sees the umpire 's finger go up as @entity2 celebrate @entity156 : substitute fielder @entity99 does his dad proud even though @entity16 would have been wary of over-bowling his big two , which he has tended to do this summer , he again seemed reluctant to give as many overs as he should have done to @entity27 ’s developing off - spin			1
what an interesting couple of days @entity27 has had			0
a point to be made about his wrist - band ‘ protest ’			0
this may not have been the best place to make a political statement but we often criticise sportsmen for being vacuous and unaware of the world around them			0
at least here we have an intelligent , principled man , and a proud @entity172 and @entity173 , who wanted to make a point about a humanitarian issue			0
he should not be criticised for that , nor slapped on the wrist by the ineffectual @entity178			0
as a spinner , @entity27 is not and probably never will be in @entity181 ’s league but he is taking wickets and added a couple more here when his captain eventually turned to him , admittedly to awful shots from @entity38 and @entity187 should have had @entity94 much earlier when he was caught down the legside by @entity189 , who had an excellent first full day behind the stumps , but @entity191 made his latest umpiring mistake			1
@entity6 smiles : the @entity2 fast bowler celebrates the wicket of @entity152 , caught behind by @entity189 paying their respects : the @entity2 team observe a minute 's silence before the start of day three to commemorate those cricketers who lost their lives in @entity201 before and after : @entity27 wearing his wristbands on monday ( left ) and without them on ( right ) running in hard : @entity2 , including centurion @entity17 ( second right ) , train before the start of play @entity206 : the message on @entity2 's shirts on day three of the third test eventually @entity27 had @entity94 caught by substitute @entity99 , son of one of @entity22 ’s greatest fielders in @entity212 , standing in for the injured @entity17			1
if @entity27 ’s wickets had an element of fortune , there was nothing lucky about the six taken by @entity5 and @entity6 , who utilised what little orthodox and reverse swing there was in the @entity22 air			1
tail - end resistance has been @entity2 ’s curse in recent times and they will again be frustrated that they allowed @entity23 to recover from 217 for six to their eventual 323 for eight , which gives them hope of avoiding the follow - on figure			0
@entity230 never looks as if he has the technique to survive in @entity2 but he was there at the close , unbeaten on 50 , while @entity30 again launched a punishing counter-attack that this time was nipped in the bud by @entity5			1
how @entity5 , with his immediate future to be decided on friday following his spat with @entity30 at @entity238 , must have enjoyed that one			1
if @entity2 can take the last two wickets quickly on wednesday , @entity16 will probably bat again and try to leave his side a day and an hour to bowl @entity23 out , but whichever way he goes about it , @entity2 are in with a real shout here of levelling the series with two @entity42 to play .			1
