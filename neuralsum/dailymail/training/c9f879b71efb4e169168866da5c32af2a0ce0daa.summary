a former @entity1 prosecutor says actor @entity2 should not be pardoned for a 1988 assault of two @entity5 men because he has never acknowledged the crime was racist			1
@entity2 filed an appeal with the @entity8 in december asking them to pardon him of a 1988 conviction for assault which saw him jailed for three months			1
the @entity13 - tipped performer claims he is a different person from the man that committed the attack 26 years ago , and has tried to make up for his actions in later life			2
however @entity19 , a former state prosecutor who led a case against @entity2 for hurling stones and racial slurs at black children two years earlier , says the appeal should be turned down			1
the case against @entity2 began in 1986 , when he and two white friends were caught chasing three black siblings in @entity41 's @entity40 neighborhood , throwing rocks and yelling racial slurs			1
the following day , @entity2 and a larger group of white friends harassed a group of mostly black fourth - graders until an ambulance driver intervened			2
ms @entity19 helped to prosecute the case against @entity2 , then aged 14 , and he was issued with an order which would allow for a criminal conviction in the event he committed another racially motivated offence			2
two years later , in 1988 , @entity2 was back in court again , this time charged with hitting a @entity5 man in the head with a stick while trying to steal alcohol from a convenience store			1
court papers filed at the time say @entity2 hit one man , named @entity63 , over the head with a five - foot wooden pole while yelling ' @entity5 f * * * * * * s * * * '			1
denied : @entity19 , who lead a case against @entity2 for hurling stone and racial slurs at black children in 1986 , says the appeal should be denied because he has never accepted his crimes were racist @entity2 went on the run from the crime scene , and before he was caught by police he punched another @entity5 man , named @entity77 , in the face			1
after he was arrested @entity2 made references to ' slant - eyed g * * * s ' in front of police			1
his previous court order was triggered , and he ended up being convicted as an adult and sentenced to three months in jail			0
he was released after about 45 days			0
he is now seeking a pardon for that conviction , saying he accepts he was high on marijuana and other drugs at the time , and has tried to become a better person as an adult			2
in an interview in december , the now 43 - year - old said : ' i 've been looking for redemption ( since ) the day i woke up and realized that i done some horrific things and was on a path of self - destruction , as well as causing a lot of people harm			0
' when i decided to petition for a pardon , it was n't based on the things i accomplished in my career			0
' it 's been the things i 've been able to do in my personal life : giving back to the community and helping kids , especially inner - city kids and at - risk youth and kids growing up in that same situation			0
' however , ms @entity112 pointed out that this apology does not acknowledge the racial element of the crimes , and therefore does not go far enough			2
@entity2 ( left ) was 16 when he hit @entity5 man @entity77 ( right ) and another shop owner while making references to ' slant eyed g * * * s ' @entity19 added that @entity2 's status and wealth should not place him in a better position than others to erase his misdeeds			1
she also said that hate crimes should be held to a higher standard			0
representatives for @entity2 , who stars in new film @entity127 and also appeared in ' @entity128 ' and ' @entity129 , ' were not available for comment at the time of publishing			2
the state parole board has to hold a hearing on the request by @entity2 and send a recommendation to the governor , who will decide whether to issue a pardon			1
final say then rests with the @entity140 , an elected body			0
governors generally do n't make pardon decisions until they 're leaving office			0
former gov. @entity145 , a @entity146 , issued just four in the final days of his eight - year tenure			0
his predecessor , @entity148 , a @entity149 , never issued one			0
gov. @entity151 , a @entity149 , took office this month .			0
