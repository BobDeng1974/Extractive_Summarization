she endured second - degree burns to her cheeks and has permanent nerve damage that left her with shooting pain and numbness in her cheeks , even five years after the surgery			1

' mrs @entity3 said she was approached by staff at a medspa in 2007 when she went in to buy makeup			1
they called the procedure a ' laser facial			0
' mrs @entity3 said she never realized that it was actually surgery performed with a powerful laser			1

disfigured : @entity66 said she has had to see neurologists , dermatologists and a plastic surgeon as a result of the laser facial procedure she later learned that the physician supervising the procedure was an @entity74 , not a certified plastic surgeon , she alleges			2

@entity3 , 42 , says the staff at the @entity24 medspa never called the laser treatment ' surgery ' and did n't *properly* warn her of the risks
she endured second - degree burns to her face and still has numbness and shooting pains in her cheeks five years after the operations
@entity66 fears others could suffer the same fate because medspas are *scarcely* regulated in many states and not overseen by qualified doctors
