by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 09:04 est , 21 august 2012 it may look like the most amazing sporting event ever seen , but in fact this @entity4 cosmonaut is helping protect himself by throwing a metal ball into space			0
during a six hour spacewalk , station commander @entity8 and flight engineer @entity9 launched the 9kg ball into orbit to help researchers on earth track space debris			1
they also installed a series of shields to protect the @entity18 from debris			1
the satellite , which is expected to remain in orbit for about three months , is intended to serve as a target for @entity4 engineers working on computer models that evaluate orbital tracking			0
it should help them understand how objects move through space , and improve the tracking of the thousands of pieces of debris that litter space			2
the two veteran cosmonauts sailed through the six - hour spacewalk outside the @entity18 on monday to prepare the orbital outpost for a new module and better shield its living quarters against small meteorite and debris impacts , officials said			1
catch ! the spherical satellite is released , as mission controllers tell the cosmonaut ' good throw ' station commander @entity8 and flight engineer @entity9 opened the hatch on the station 's airlock at 11:37am edt ( 1537 gmt ) to begin a spacewalk to relocate a construction crane , install debris shields and release the small satellite into orbit			1
the sphere is sent into space using a bizarre ' space lacrosse ' system developed by @entity4 engineers			2
their departure was delayed about an hour while engineers assessed a leak between the @entity70 docking module and @entity4 segments of the station , a $ 100 billion laboratory for microgravity experiments and technology testing that flies about 250 miles ( 400km ) above @entity76			0
success : the metal sphere is released and sent spinning into space by an astronaut ( left ) wearing a space suit but the issue was resolved and the experienced spacewalkers more than made up the lost time			0
@entity8 , who was making his ninth spacewalk , and @entity9 , on his fifth , moved a hand - operated , 46 - foot ( 14 - meter ) crane , called @entity90 , from the outside of @entity70 to @entity92 , the cornerstone of the station			0
@entity70 is due to be detached from the station next year to make room for a new @entity4 laboratory and docking module			0
the ' space lacrosse ' attachment can be clearly seen as the astronaut prepares to move on to the next phase of the spacewalk the @entity104 completed construction of its part of the outpost last year and retired its three space shuttles			1
@entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 also are partners on the project			0
with the crane in place , the spacewalkers then used a hand tool to launch a 20 - pound ( nine - kg ) spherical satellite on a path behind the space station			1
' @entity125 throw , ' a flight director in the @entity4 mission control centre outside @entity123 said through a translator monitoring radio communications with the cosmonauts			0
the sphere is seen spinning off into distance over earth , where it will be monitored by researchers on earth to improve the accuracy of tracking space debris			1
the spacewalkers ' last major task was to install five debris shields to the outside of the zvezda module , the crew 's primary living quarters			1
they also retrieved a briefcase - sized experiment that has been exposing various materials to the harsh environment of space and installed two support struts on a ladder			2
@entity8 and @entity9 returned through an airlock and shut the hatch at 5:28pm edt ( 2128 gmt ) , completing the 163rd spacewalk for station assembly and maintenance			0
on aug. 30 , @entity157 astronaut @entity156 and @entity110 astronaut @entity158 , both station flight engineers , are scheduled to make another spacewalk to replace a power relay unit on the station 's truss , set up power cables for the @entity4 laboratory module scheduled to launch next year and install a thermal cover on a docking port .			2
