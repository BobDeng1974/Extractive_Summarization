its smoke - blackened ceilings lit by builders ' lamps , this is the charred @entity5 library nine months into a painstaking restoration			1
opened in 1909 , the @entity8 's dark wood , high windows , ornate balcony and clusters of electric lamps helped it become known as a turning point in modern architecture and one of the finest buildings in @entity17			0
but the much - loved centre of learning was gutted last year by a blaze sparked when canned spray foam , which a student was using for an art project , drifted into a projector fan and caught alight			1
he also designed offices for the @entity44 newspapers the @entity60 and @entity61 alongside the @entity62 in the city			0
its demise began at 12.27pm on may 23 last year in the basement , where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year show			1
an unnamed student was using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in an artwork which involved three large sheets of foam , each up to three inches thick			1
the foam sheets formed three ' walls ' framing a fourth blank wall , onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place			1
as the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room , they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board			1
how it looked : opened in 1909 , the @entity8 's dark wood , high windows , ornate balcony and clusters of electric lamps helped it become known as a turning point in modern architecture and one of the finest buildings in @entity17 precious : the original library			2
the fire prompted anguish in the art and architecture community , which said it was @entity54 's finest work ravaged : the blaze broke out on may 23 last year after a student preparing for a final - year degree exhibition used spray foam near a projector damage : the spray foam fumes were ignited by the projector 's hot circuit board , and the blaze spread to three larger sheets of foam nearby remains : this image released at the time showed the devastating extent of the damage to the library			1
piece by piece , the rubble was cleared the alarm was raised as the fire spread through the spray foam to the larger foam ' walls ' , but it was too late			1
the blaze engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the ' iconic and unique ' building 's west wing			0
eyewitnesses described how firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder , forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school , preventing the blaze from spreading			0
other firefighters then darted in and out of the building , despite the flames , to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by @entity54 after being shown photographs of the artefacts by curators and told where to find them			2
no one was injured in the fire , which after a six - month investigation was put down to a tragic accident by the art school 's leaders			2
nine months later , builders are still assessing the extent of the damage as they stabilise the building to prepare for its restoration			2
behind the hoardings : builders are due to finish their work next month , giving way to nine months of design work for a restored building blackened : a view of the top - floor professors ' studios in the @entity179 , which remain open to the air nine months after the fire open air : @entity183 hope a fully - restored art school with an exhibition space and visitor centre will open in 2018 or 2019 , costing up to £ 35m intact : a spokesman said the ' hen run ' on the roof of the building ( pictured ) , which many thought lost , is in fact still structurally sound long journey : the @entity195 has given £ 5m and fundraisers have handed over £ 1m so far , which the @entity197 has vowed to match hard at work : the building was insured for £ 50m but art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount , as the east wing was untouched thousands of damaged pieces of building material , including blackened stones from the library walls , have been removed and numbered with chalk in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before			1
the building was insured for £ 50million but art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount , because the east wing was almost completely untouched by the fire			2
however , they have already received £ 5million from the @entity195 in @entity216 , £ 1million from fundraisers and another £ 1million in match funding from the @entity197			0
builders are finally due to finish assessing the damage next month , at which a firm of architects will be chosen to lead the restoration project			0
design work will take nine months with builders returning to the site early next year			0
@entity183 hope a fully - restored art school with an exhibition space and visitor centre will open in 2018 or 2019			0
numbered : blackened stones from the walls of the building have been labelled with chalk in the hope they can return to their original positions artefacts : hundreds of items which were recovered after the fire have been carefully catalogued , some of them placed in plastic bags ornate : a plaster cast on the building which survived the blaze ( left ) and a 1901 memorial plaque to one - time chairman sir @entity246 the project is set to cost anywhere between £ 20million and £ 35million , and the finished building will not necessarily resemble the design by @entity54			1
art school leaders are tight - lipped about exactly what the design will look like , but they insist it will be ' holistic ' and consistent across the whole building			0
at the time the @entity5 vowed the library would ‘ rise like a phoenix from the ashes ’ , partly thanks to detailed blueprints which were left to the school by @entity54 himself			1
‘ @entity54 was an amazing designer but he used ordinary materials , ' said a spokesman last may			0
' those materials are still available today and we have the plans for the library and the photographs , so we can rebuild it			0
it wo n’t be tomorrow but we will make it happen			0

century - old library at @entity5 designed by @entity54 was destroyed last may
fire began after flammable spray foam for a student artwork was sucked into projector fan and caught alight
new photos show charred *interior* of library as builders pave way for restoration which could cost £ 35million
blackened stones from the walls are numbered in the hope they can be returned to their original positions
