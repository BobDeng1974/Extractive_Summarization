police in @entity1 have been accused of racism after dna tests proved that two blond children taken from their @entity6 gypsy parents were rightfully theirs			1
detectives were responding to public tip offs fueled by media coverage of the alleged child abduction case involving blonde - haired girl @entity11 and a family of @entity6 in @entity13			1

' taken : the two - year - old , pictured back at home in @entity20 , was kept overnight by authorities he defended the need for police and child welfare officers to remove children from potentially dangerous homes , but cautioned that @entity1 authorities must ensure ' that no group or minority community is singled out for unwarranted suspicion in relation to child protection issues			1

on monday , police went to one @entity6 family 's home in southwest @entity18 and sought the passport and birth certificate of the seven - year - old girl			1
the family produced them , but police opted to issue an emergency child protection order and placed the child in state care			0
police said the @entity98 passport was not useful because it had a baby photo , not the girl 's current appearance , while the birth certificate did not match @entity18 hospital records			1
on tuesday , police in the midlands town of @entity20 went to another @entity6 family 's home and asked both parents to provide mouth - swab samples from their son and themselves			1

much media coverage : @entity131 with husband @entity132 and little @entity11 , the @entity6 couple under arrest in @entity13 over the alleged abduction of the little girl @entity124 said his clients were ' very conscious of the fact that this case has been linked ' with the @entity13 child - abduction case , ' which has nothing to do with them '			1

@entity80 , a @entity18 - based support group for @entity6 , said the police were guilty of racial profiling and child abduction			2
the group 's co-director , @entity153 , said he feared that more children of @entity6 parents who are not dark - skinned and have brown eyes could be taken away for dna tests			2
he said : ' it 's outrageous			0
' in a statement the @entity47 force defended its actions as consistent with child - protection laws			0
the statement added ; ' we take extremely serious ( ly ) all reports received from members of the public concerning child welfare issues			0
