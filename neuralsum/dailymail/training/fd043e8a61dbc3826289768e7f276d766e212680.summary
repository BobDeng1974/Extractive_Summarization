it 's the hottest , most consistently sunny summer many of us can remember , but dressing for hot weather continues to challenge us			0
one quirky brand has decided to embrace the little perils of summer dressing with a new eyebrow - raising fashion range			2
@entity11 - based retailer @entity9 has come up with two new t - shirts which make the wearer appear to be committing snigger - inducing fashion faux pas			1
this top , dubbed the @entity16 , created the illusion that you 're wearing swimwear underneath this cheeky transparent bra back print top is actually aimed at men , as a ( very confusing ) novelty item the first design looks as if it is drenched before you even put it on			0
in fact , it 's designed to make the wearer appear to have pulled a plain white top over a wet dark navy swimsuit - thus causing the top to go soggy and see - through			0
it 's aptly called the soaked - through @entity33 t - shirt , and with it the makers saying they are celebrating the ' idiocy of summertime '			1
the top is designed to make the wearer appear to have donned a plain white top over a swimsuit the design form the book and novelty shop already looks drenched before you even put it on if you 'd rather not give the impression that you 're slippery to the touch , but still want to raise a few eyebrows this summer , @entity9 's second titillating t - shirt is just the thing			1
it features a barely - there outline of black bra straps on the back and the quirky top is actually designed for blokes			0
quite why , we ca n't tell , but the so - called @entity60 's t - shirt is sure to raise a few confused eyebrows down the pub. this men 's @entity63 from @entity65 features the outline of black bra straps on the back @entity9 's second titillating t - shirt is actually designed for blokes , and sure to raise some brows the front is a little more modest , with just a small bra logo stitched into it			1
both designs retail for 2,808 yen ( £ 16.40 ) each and are exclusive to @entity9 's online store			2
the wet t - shirt version is available to buy now ( reportedly selling fast ) , while pre-orders are currently being taken for the men 's bra option reports @entity78			2
the front of the bra - print top is a little more modest , with just a small bra logo stitched into it			0

@entity11 - based novelty shop @entity9 have designed two tops
@entity33 t - shirt and @entity60 's top cost £ 16.40 each
