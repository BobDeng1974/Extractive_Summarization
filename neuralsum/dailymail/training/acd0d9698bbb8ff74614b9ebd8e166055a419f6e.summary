by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 11:13 est , 15 march 2013 it 's a rare and unsettling phenomenon that animal lovers may find hard to swallow - though , perhaps not as hard as the razor - toothed reptile in question			1
but a hungry crocodile has been captured on camera chomping on one of its less fortunate cousins in a rare documented case of cannibalism			2
the two - metre long reptile , nicknamed @entity12 , was hunting for prawns and small fish when he came across the other crocodile			1
but instead of ignoring the younger croc , he attacked the metre long rival , killed and ate it himself head first in a grim , cannibalistic spectacle			1
mr @entity22 said : ' he had obviously killed it and was attempting to swallow it , but it was just a little too big , so he swam away with it			1
' when we saw him a few days later , he had a big belly so he must have finished it			0
' i have been working on the @entity36 river for about 15 years and this is the third time i have seen this happen			0
light bite : the moment was captured by @entity22 , who runs @entity24 boat tours on the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 no messing : the saltwater crocodile is the world 's largest reptile and they are known for their fierce , territorial natures ' the other two times hatchlings were the victims but this was a two - year - old being eaten by a seven - year old			1
while saltwater crocodile attacks on humans are rare , there are almost no recorded incidents of crocodiles eating their own kind			2
they are known to be very lethargic creatures - a trait that allows them to survive for up to a month without eating			2
but when they do eat , their diet tends to consist of almost anything they can sink their teeth into , including crustaceans , fish , turtles , snakes , lizards , birds , bats , kangaroos , dingoes , domestic dogs , horses , cattle , buffalo , pigs and , sometimes , humans			0
they have even been observed feeding on sharks			0
what they can not digest , such as bones and hair , they tend to regurgitate or leave to one side			0
they are known to bring up giant hair balls of feral pig hair			0
when attacking very large prey , they always rely on their lightening - speed ambushing technique - but can also run very fast over short distances if they choose to			2
crocodiles are known to leap out of the water to grab prey and can propel themselves vertically for most of their body length straight up in the air to grab prey			0
' we call him @entity12 , although it could be @entity106			0
he is about two - metres long			1
saltwater crocodiles are opportunistic feeders and there is no emotion involved			0
' while saltwater crocodile attacks on humans are rare , there are almost no recorded incidents of crocodiles eating their own kind			2
signs warning humans not to venture near waters known to house saltwater crocodiles in @entity27 are common , but that has not prevented tragedies from occurring			1
last december , a 12 - year - old boy was snatched by one such beast in the country 's @entity125 , and dragged out into the water where he was devoured			2
less than two weeks earlier a seven - year - old girl was killed by a crocodile in the the same state			1
police searching the waterhole shot dead a 10ft crocodile and an examination of the reptile revealed what were believed to be remains of the child in its stomach			1
the saltwater crocodile is the world 's largest reptile and they are known for their fierce , territorial natures			1
they can grow up to more than six - metres in length and , while known as ' salties ' , they are most commonly found in freshwater			0
they are found in suitable habitats from @entity27 through @entity154 to the eastern coast of @entity156 , historically ranging as far west as off the eastern coast of @entity158 and as far east as waters off of @entity160			1
