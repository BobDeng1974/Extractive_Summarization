by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 08:58 est , 6 february 2013 a prehistoric @entity2 reptile which could walk on all fours or take to the skies on three metre wings has been unearthed by scientists			1
the newly discovered pterorsaur , which is 68million years old , was unearthed in @entity9 's @entity8			1
the creature , named @entity11 , had a long neck and beak and could fold up its huge wings when it needed to walk on all fours			1
preserved elements of @entity11 re-assembled as found in partial articulation : the 68million year old creature walked on all fours and had a wing span of three metres , scientists believe dr @entity22 , from the @entity23 , said : ' @entity11 belong to a group of pterosaurs called the azhdarchids			2
' these were long - necked , long - beaked pterosaurs whose wings were strongly adapted for a soaring lifestyle			0
' several features of their wing and hind limb bones show that they could fold their wings up and walk on all fours when needed			0
' with a three - metre wingspan , @entity11 would have been large , but not gigantic			0
' this is true of many of the animals so far discovered in @entity9 ; they were often unusually small compared to their relatives elsewhere			0
' cervical vertebrae three and four in articulation , showing the presence of circular bitemarks ( arrows ) : the newly discovered pterorsaur was unearthed in @entity9 's @entity8 the discovery is the most complete example of an azhdarchid found in @entity50 so far and it supports a long - argued theory about the behaviour of these types of creatures			1
dr @entity55 , senior lecturer in @entity56 , based at the @entity57 said : ' experts have argued for years over the lifestyle and behaviour of azhdarchids			0
' it has been suggested that they grabbed prey from the water while in flight , that they patrolled wetlands and hunted in a heron or stork - like fashion , or that they were like gigantic sandpipers , hunting by pushing their long bills into mud			0
' one of the newest ideas is that azhdarchids walked through forests , plains and other places in search of small animal prey			1
' @entity11 supports this view of azhdarchids , since these fossils come from an inland , continental environment where there were forests and plains as well as large , meandering rivers and swampy regions			2
' more vertebrae : the discovery is the most complete example of an azhdarchid found in @entity50 so far and it supports a long - argued theory about the behaviour of these types of creatures where the bones were found : the star on this map of @entity9 highlights the area in the @entity2 basin where the researchers found the fossilised remains fossils from the region show that there were several places where both giant azhdarchids and small azhdarchids lived side by side			1
@entity11 's discovery indicates that there were many different animals hunting different prey in the region at the same time , demonstrating a much more complicated picture of the @entity123 world than first thought , the researchers said			2
their findings were reported in the open - access journal @entity127 .			0

the 68million - year - old pterosaur remains were discovered in @entity9 's @entity2 basin
@entity11 had long neck and beak and could fold its huge wings to walk on all fours
find supports theory that the creatures *stalked* the forests and plains of the region in search of small animal prey
