' there is an office syndicate who group together and buy tickets - no one could believe it when they won			1
' the win has gone a bit sour though as there are three people who the others say have n’t paid for their tickets			0
' it ’s all a bit awkward and there ’s a bad atmosphere - it ’s terrible how people can turn so nasty when a bit of money is involved			1
' more than 5,000 people work at the @entity10 offices in @entity59 , @entity60			0
it is thought the @entity10 workers will hold a vote as they do not have a syndicate contract			2
