@entity1 was ruined for tens of thousands of passengers caught up in train chaos when botched engineering work over-ran , a damning report said today			1
more than 115,000 people faced ' widespread confusion , frustration , disruption , discomfort and anxiety ' in the @entity1 rail engineering overruns , the rail regulator said			1
@entity13 came under fire for late - finishing work over the festive period which hit services into @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 stations in @entity22			1
passengers were left in tears in some cases with hundreds of journeys ruined by the overrunning works			2
the disruption caused chaos at @entity19 , @entity20 and at @entity21 where there was overcrowding queues formed at @entity21 station , because of the closure of @entity33 due to overrunning maintenance work @entity37 mainline services into @entity19 were halted over @entity1 for the works between the terminus and @entity21 in north @entity22			1
when they over-ran into the weekend there was chaos as services between @entity44 , the @entity45 and @entity22 were cancelled			0
those that ran were massively overcrowded and delayed , while suburban @entity21 station failed to cope with the crowds			1
the crush was so great at one stage that passengers were unable to disembark			2
some services were ushered into @entity19 by railmen waving red and yellow flags			2
the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) said the catalogue of problems led to ' unacceptable ' service levels			1
' passengers were really let down , ' said @entity56 's railway markets and economics director @entity61			1
the @entity56 report into the disruption , affecting services on saturday december 27 and sunday december 28 , follows @entity13 's own critical report last month which acknowledged the company 's failings			1
in today 's report the @entity56 said : the @entity56 made a number of recommendations to ensure ' that in future passengers do not suffer the same experience '			1
engineers were forced to use red and yellow flags to signal trains in and out of the station today as the chaos at @entity33 continued the report said : ' passengers who travel between @entity1 and the new year include families with young children , the elderly and vulnerable often travelling with lots of luggage in an unfamiliar environment			0
' over the two days we estimate that more than 115,000 passengers were affected in some way by this disruption			1
' the report went on : ' there were impressive examples of good service from individual members of staff but the overall service passengers received was not acceptable			0
' it led to widespread confusion , frustration , disruption , discomfort and anxiety			1
' ms @entity61 said : ' @entity13 has rightly acknowledged it did n't do enough for passengers affected by overrunning engineering works at @entity19 and @entity20 this @entity1			1
@entity13 chief executive @entity104 , who was criticised for not returning from his holiday home in @entity107 when the problems occurred , repeated his apology today ' while the company generally has a good record for delivering engineering work on time , in this instance passengers were really let down			1
' she went on : ' our investigation found that contingency planning did not fully consider the impact of potential overruns on passengers and that this needs to change			1
' in future , plans will address the impact on passengers as well as engineering and train operation issues			2
nr can not achieve this alone , train operators will also need to play their part			0
' ms @entity61 added : ' @entity13 has committed to ensuring all work undertaken this @entity133 has a contingency plan which is fit for purpose , and to implement all recommendations in time for engineering works planned over christmas 2015			1
' @entity56 will audit its progress , to ensure that passengers ' needs and safety are central to @entity13 's and train operator contingency arrangements			1
' @entity13 chief executive @entity104 , who was criticised for not returning from his holiday home in @entity107 when the problems occurred , repeated his apology today			0
he said : ' putting passengers at the heart of our planning is absolutely the right thing to do and we recognise that we let people down during the disruption experienced on december 27 and 28			1
' over @entity1 , we undertook the biggest programme of engineering and investment work ever , upgrading train lines across the country			0
the overwhelming majority of this work went to plan but in the case of @entity19 and @entity20 we accept we got things wrong			1
' our own report has caused us to look again at the work we have planned this year and the contingency plans we have in place and the @entity56 's report underlines the necessity of this work			1
' @entity170 chairman @entity169 said : ' nr must implement the @entity56 's recommendations in full so that passengers do not face avoidable disruption and chaos			2
' the scenes at @entity1 were unacceptable			0
bad planning , the failure of contingency arrangements and breakdown in communication resulted in thousands of people waiting for hours in the cold outside @entity21 station , or stuck on delayed trains			1
' she went on : ' the rail sector must work together to ensure that @entity13 's planning and communication improves			2
@entity13 's investment programme for 2014/19 means that more major and complex engineering work will need to take place			0
nr must learn from their errors to regain the confidence of the public			0
' @entity197 transport secretary @entity196 said : ' over 100,000 passengers were affected by the rail chaos over the @entity1 period			2
we now know that @entity203 's government was warned and failed to act			0
' while it is clear that @entity13 needs to learn lessons , out of touch ministers must learn from their failure too			0
' passengers on trains to @entity211 from @entity22 , one of the worst affected routes yesterday , complained of overcrowding as they were forced to stand in aisles and sit on the floor despite purchasing tickets he went on : ' it is also increasingly evident that there needs to be big reforms to the running of our railway so that we have a rail service that is fit for purpose			2
' the @entity56 is right to say that the rail industry must place passengers at the heart of enhanced contingency planning			1
@entity231 has argued consistently that passengers must be given a proper voice in the running of the railway , so that they are at the centre of the way in which the industry is run			2
' @entity238 , director general of the @entity239 which represents operators and @entity13 , said : ' major projects like those completed over @entity1 are crucial to improving the railway			0
' but many passengers did not get the service they deserved in the days following @entity1 and for that we are very sorry			0
@entity13 and operators are working closely together to avoid making the same mistakes again			0
' he added : ' passengers are our primary focus and it is vital that the industry provides them with accurate and timely information , particularly during disruption			0
' in the coming months train operators will be publishing individual plans to improve customer communications			0
' @entity259 , leader of the @entity261 rail union , said : ' this report reveals that the @entity264 chaos was such a shambles because @entity13 tried to substitute a small suburban station , @entity21 , for mainline @entity19 which has 12 platforms			1
' any schoolboy knows you can not get a quart into a pint pot. for some reason , no one at the top of @entity13 seemed to know that basic fact			0
' when they tried to ignore this very basic sum , tens of thousands of passengers had their holidays ruined			0
' @entity279 , director at rail customer watchdog @entity280 , said : ' thousands of passengers were left angry and frustrated when trying to travel at @entity1			0
' we heard of passengers standing for hours on trains , locked outside stations and left to find out what to do by themselves			2
' he went on : ' this can not happen again			0
we welcome this report from the regulator , which echoes our call for industry to put passengers ' experience right at the heart of planning , especially for plans to cope and compensate when things go wrong			2
' transport secretary @entity301 said : ' passengers should be at the heart of everything the rail industry does			0
the industry must learn lessons to avoid any repeat of the completely unacceptable disruption we saw in december			0
' @entity13 and the operators are delivering essential improvements that we are investing in as part of our long - term economic plan			0
however , it is vital they ensure these works are properly planned and any impacts to services are communicated to passengers			2

@entity56 found 115,000 people were affected by problems
@entity20 and @entity19 were to *reopen* on december 27 after works
but @entity20 was closed all *morning* and @entity19 all day
@entity20 safety work which should have taken two hours took ten
people faced ' widespread confusion , frustration , discomfort and anxiety '
the planning of the @entity19 work did not take proper account of the impact of failing to hand back a working line on december 27 ;
a contingency plan developed on the evening of @entity344 was ineffective and resulted in @entity21 becoming so overcrowded it had to be closed for a time ;
reporting of the progress of the works at @entity20 was *inaccurate* so that the operational contingency plan was not *enacted* until many passengers had already been *severely* delayed .
