wants her job back : 999 call handler @entity2 claims she was sacked by @entity3 for being ' too jolly ' after chuckling with a caller a 999 operator who ' laughed and sniggered ' throughout a call from a man reporting that a suspected drink - driver may have been involved in a hit - and - run has been sacked for gross misconduct			1
@entity2 failed to ' grasp the seriousness of the situation ' after joking with the caller when he made a mistake while giving her the registration of the car			1
a disciplinary hearing was told that she ' got the giggles ' and from then on ' failed to deal with the conversation in a sober and professional manner '			1
she then graded the call with the incorrect heading ' suspicious circumstances ' rather than ' non-stop road traffic collision '			1
miss @entity2 , 38 , who worked for @entity3 , had been told by the caller that a member of his own family may have been drink - driving			1
but she did not take immediate steps to start an investigation or gather evidence that could have helped with the search for the suspect or victims			1
it was only when a dispatcher realised the seriousness of the incident that more immediate action was taken			2
the adjudicator said : ' it is extremely fortunate that the dispatcher who picked up this incident , reviewed and reassessed its nature and urgency and took effective action			0
' the driver in question was found to have been involved in two collisions that evening and failed to stop at both of them			1
one of the victims was a cyclist who was lucky to escape serious injury , it was heard			0
dismissing her for gross misconduct , the adjudicator ruled her actions ' could have potentially put lives at risk and adversely affected public confidence '			1
the call , which was made on november 9 last year , became light - hearted when the caller , @entity62 , struggled to recall the phonetic alphabet and suggested ' e as in @entity65 - i do n’t know the proper one '			1
mother - of - two @entity68 corrected him that it was ' echo '			1
a recording of the conversation reveals the caller laughs first , saying : ' i do n’t know the proper one '			0
after some giggling by both , the caller adds : ' you will be laughing all night now '			0
call centre : @entity3 headquarters in @entity79 , @entity80 , where @entity2 worked for four years a letter from a detective inspector investigating the matter for @entity3 to @entity68 said : ' during the call , when receiving details from the caller , you started to laugh excessively at a mistake the caller had made and you continued to laugh and snigger throughout the call			1
' miss @entity2 , of @entity91 , near @entity92 , @entity3 , says she chuckled with the caller to ' help him relax '			1
she admitted mis - grading the call , but claimed the call was made more than three hours after the alleged incidents			2
speaking after the hearing , she said : ' i was told i was being too jolly , laughing and happy on the phone			2
' the grounds given were that i could have potentially put someone 's life at risk and have a dangerous effect on public confidence			2
' it was not at his expense - he said something funny and i laughed with him			0
it got him over his nerves and helped him to relax			0
' investigating officer miss @entity2 - who had worked at police @entity111 in @entity80 , @entity3 , for four years before the incident - has now launched an appeal against her sacking			1
' people need to know they are talking to a friendly human , not a robot , and you can build a rapport with them			0
@entity121 and helpful is what the public wants			0
' i 've spoken to the caller since and he ca n't believe what has happened			0
there have been calls where i have literally saved someone 's life			0
' @entity62 , who said it was an agonising decision to make the call , was shocked to learn @entity68 had been sacked			0
he made the call , which involved a family member , after much deliberation over the impact it might have on his family relationship			2
he said : ' i was very nervous about making the call but through her professionalism i was able to tell her everything that happened and all the details			0
' if she had not been so good , or if i ’d had someone blunt and rude , i would have hung up			0
' a police spokesman said : ' @entity3 can confirm the civilian member of staff was dismissed from the force for gross misconduct following an allegation of negligence			2
' an appeal against the dismissal has been made and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time			0
