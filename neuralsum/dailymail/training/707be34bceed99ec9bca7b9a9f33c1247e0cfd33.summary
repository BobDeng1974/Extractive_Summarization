share prices in @entity1 plunged today despite the chain 's new finance director @entity70 , left , being parachuted in early following talks between @entity1 ceo , @entity74 , right , and @entity70 's former boss at @entity76 under pressure : @entity1 has taken a hit to profits after competition from low - cost rivals such as @entity82 and @entity83 the couple put on regular workshops and courses to help people achieve a ‘ more compassionate and enriching understanding both of others and ourselves ’			1

it was always a case of , “ what is it now , @entity7 ? ” as he came running into the office			0
‘ there are not many people who think he knows what he is doing			0
’ the source said sir @entity7 ’s biggest failure was to get rid of mr @entity141 when his replacement , @entity70 of @entity76 , was not due to start until december			1
