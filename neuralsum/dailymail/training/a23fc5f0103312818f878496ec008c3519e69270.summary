the ongoing negotiations between @entity62 , his @entity64 ’ association advisers and @entity65 over his severance terms are likely to be combative in the extreme			1
the @entity62 camp will make the most of the widely criticised way @entity65 handled his leaked departure			1
meanwhile , @entity65 are said to be very unimpressed with @entity74 boss @entity73 being so critical of their ‘ unprofessional manner ’ in the middle of sensitive pay - off talks			2
hard times : @entity80 to reach @entity62 ' settlement are expected to be combative @entity82 picked a novel way of showing how long he ’s been out of the first team at @entity9 before his midweek @entity86 semi-final return — he grew a beard			1
