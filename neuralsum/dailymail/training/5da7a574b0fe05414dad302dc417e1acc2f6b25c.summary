@entity3 , 37 , who survived cancer , is suing the @entity5 after she was given the all - clear to a smear test - and got cervical cancer two years later a mother - of - two who was diagnosed with cervical is suing the @entity5 because she was hit with the disease two years after getting the all clear from a smear test			1
@entity3 , 37 , from @entity14 , south @entity13 was one of the thousands of women who went to the doctors for a smear test as part of the ' @entity21 effect ' caused by when the @entity22 star died from cervical cancer in 2009			1
she was given the all clear two years ago , when her results came back as ' normal ' and she continued her day - to - day life			1
but two years later @entity3 went to the doctor with worrying symptoms , and was later diagnosed as cervical cancer			1
@entity3 then had to undergo several weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy , followed by surgery , before being told she was in remission			1
now , she is taking legal action against @entity34 after saying her test was wrongly reported as clear when there were abnormalities			2
she also wants new rules to be introduced which will mean stricter double - checking of test results			2
@entity3 said : “ i passed out when the doctors told me , i was very scared			1
' i had two children aged five and four at the time and i had separated from my husband so i was worried about who would look after my children			0
' the whole ordeal has had a huge physical and emotional impact on me			0
' i go for regular smear tests and it ’s distressing to know that abnormalities were there but they were not reported			0
@entity3 with her children @entity56 , 8 and @entity58 , 10			1
because of the cancer she has had to undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy and will not be able to have children again ' i know that mistakes will always happen but making the screening system safer by ensuring tests are thoroughly double checked could help to capture more cases where errors have been made			1
' this in turn could help to ensure more women at risk of cervical cancer get the treatment they urgently need			2
' one of @entity3 's first tests was five years ago after @entity21 's case hit the news			1
like @entity21 , @entity3 claims that despite having the correct examination clear signs were missed			2
she says her treatment of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and surgery has caused her to have long - term health problems , including not being able to have any more children , and lymphoedema , a condition that causes her legs to swell			1
as a result , she has mobility problems , and has been forced to give up her job as an elderly support worker			0
@entity92 , @entity94 ’s medical negligence solicitor at firm @entity95 said : ' the screen process does involve some smear tests being doubled - checked			2
' however the second ‘ rapid review ’ check is done very quickly , meaning there is greater room for error			0
' as a safety net to pick up cases that were missed on the first check it is not ideal			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity34 said : ' we are aware of ms @entity3 ’s case but due to ongoing legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the matter at this time			0
' cervical screening is about 80 per cent to 90 per cent reliable and can prevent 60 to 80 % of cervical cancers , and there are several factors at play in the taking and reading of cervical screenings which makes it impossible for it to be 100 per cent accurate			0
in addition , a cervical screening will not give a final diagnosis , as it is just a screening test used to detect early abnormalities , not cancer as a whole			0
@entity128 recommends women attend as many screenings as they are invited to and take the advice they are given at these screenings .			0

@entity3 , 37 , of , @entity134 , @entity13 was given all - clear
she was diagnosed with cancer two years after being told she was okay
had to undergo treatment - surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy
now she can not have any more children and has trouble with mobility
she is suing @entity147 , as she *believes* they should have caught the cancer before it developed *fully* when she had the smear test
