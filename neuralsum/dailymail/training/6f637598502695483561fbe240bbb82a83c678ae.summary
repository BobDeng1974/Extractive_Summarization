tired of arduously making your own cocktail when you get home after a hard day of work ? then you might want to invest in @entity6 , a concept from @entity9 design student @entity8 that will make your drink and then fly it to you			1
the robot drone bartender cap apparently make a healthy cocktail , tea or coffee with accurate numbers of calories for your body			2
@entity9 design student @entity8 has revealed his idea for flying robot bartenders ( shown )			1
called @entity20 the concept is part of the 2014 @entity24 contest			1
the flying drones would be capable of making hot and cold drinks and then serving them the ambitious design is just one among dozens of finalists in the @entity24 competition that also includes robot fish that clean your clothes and free - floating fridge bubbles			1
instant cleaning glove this glove disintegrates any stain or dirt from fabrics with a ‘ simple ’ combination of nanotechnology , ultrasound and water			0
air globe make the air and temperature in your house mimic that in another location such as @entity50			0
pure towel device that cleans your towel using ultraviolet rays and a high speed dryer fan			0
@entity56 this is a packaging system that turns leftover food into cubes for easy storage			0
@entity62 mobile device follows your pet and cleans up after them to help people overcome allergies			0
‘ the main idea in the @entity20 concept is making custom cocktails or fresh juices for you , ’ says @entity69 , from the @entity70			1
the drone can be filled with liquid and then would be capable of pouring them in cups of different sizes : 0.25 , 0.33 or 0.5 litres ( 8.5 , 11.2 and 17.6 ounces )			2
once a drink is poured on a flat surface the robot picks the beverage up and flies it to you			2
@entity20 , named after a ‘ fine barman ’ at @entity69 ’s university , would be in the form of a @entity88			2
water and other liquids stored on the robot would be temperature - controlled , so it could be heated or cooled as needed			0
a logo on the side of the robot would show you how much liquid is inside and also its temperature			0
the ‘ smart brain ’ of the robot , which is @entity101 enabled , could respond to voice commands			0
and @entity20 could also to tell you the number of calories , carbohydrates , fats and proteins in your drink			1
@entity20 , named after a ' fine barman ' at @entity69 's university , would be in the form of a @entity112			2
somewhat unnervingly , the robot will also come and find you and wake you up with a drink in the morning , if you desire , as it is supposedly capable of tracking people down ' here you can see the family of tomorrow , ' says @entity8			1
' they have their own @entity20 droids			2
robots are making fresh juices for them			0
' the robot would be capable of making hot and cold drinks , while a logo on the side would tell you the state of the liquid inside @entity69 even claims the ambitious design would be self - recharging			1
‘ the accumulator is a kinetic system that uses kinetic energy of droid , ’ he says			0
‘ so you do n't carry about his energy			0
he is working like luxury @entity138 watches			0

@entity20 is one of many innovative design concepts in the @entity24 competition , the winner of which will receive £ 4,000 ( $ 6,800 ) and a 6 - month internship at an @entity24 global design centre			1
of the many other designs one , called @entity148 , is a tank that contains robot fish			1
when clothes are put inside the tank the fish will apparently eat dirt on the clothes and clean them			1
another bizarre concept is the @entity159 , a floating refrigerator that you can store food inside			2
it uses magnetic forces to float , with the ceiling being the magnetic force provider , and the bubbles can be controlled by a smartphone for you to open them and access the food			0
