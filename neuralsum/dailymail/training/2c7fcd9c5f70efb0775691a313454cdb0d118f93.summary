dr @entity0 specialises in coronary heart disease and diabetes , but her habit of prescribing medicine for the cat became ‘ common knowledge ’ at her surgery			1
the 35 - year old justified the prescriptions by saying she ‘ knew how expensive medication was when prescribed by the vet ’			0
many pet owners will be aware of the painful cost of vets ’ bills – but dr @entity24 ’s sister , @entity23 , 37 , sends her daughter to the £ 10,000 - a - year @entity26 and lives in a large detached house			1
between june and december 2013 , dr @entity24 – who practises at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 – submitted five private prescriptions for insulin , needles and chemotherapy tablets to @entity36 and @entity37 pharmacy in the town			1
all items were charged at cost and the prescriptions were made out ‘ for use in my practice ’ – despite being intended for the cat			2
insulin needles for animals can cost double those for humans , at around £ 13 for 100			0
according to the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) the medical treatment of animals is restricted to those registered with the @entity54 , so by writing a prescription for a cat , dr @entity24 was breaking the law			1
last month , dr @entity24 complained about @entity58 ’ workloads in her local newspaper , saying : ‘ gps are bearing the brunt of trying to save @entity64 money ... we need better funding to recruit to reduce the intensity of our workloads			1
’ but a whistleblower said : ‘ it ’s outrageous			0
perhaps this doctor ’s workload would be less if she stuck to medicine and not veterinary practice			0
’ he said he became aware of the prescriptions because dr @entity24 ‘ was very open about it and it was common knowledge ’			1
the whistleblower complained to the @entity50 , who admitted that dr @entity24 had broken the law – but decided against any further action			1
the @entity50 is the main regulator for doctors , and ensures they meet good standards of medical practice			0
when she initially found out about the complaint , dr @entity24 telephoned the @entity50 to tell them she had consulted with the vet , and justified the prescriptions by saying that vet ’s bills were too expensive			1
between june and december 2013 , dr @entity24 – who practises at @entity28 ( above ) in @entity29 , @entity30 – submitted five private prescriptions for insulin , needles and chemotherapy tablets to @entity36 and @entity37 pharmacy in the town in its response to the complaint , the @entity50 admitted that the prescriptions were for a cat but said further investigation was not warranted			1
it stated : ‘ it is alleged that dr @entity24 prescribed inappropriately and irresponsibly in that she prescribed medication for her sister ’s cat			2
‘ dr @entity24 [ clarified ] ... that she had first consulted with the vet and pharmacist before prescribing the medication			2
the prescriptions were made out “ for use in my practice ”			0
‘ by treating a cat dr @entity24 has transgressed the legal remit of veterinary practice			2
however we note dr @entity24 ’s comment that she had talked to the vet and pharmacist and thus taken steps to ensure that the cat received appropriate medication			2
‘ dr @entity24 did write that the medication was for use in practice , which was not true			2
[ however ] , the case examiners concluded that we do not need to take any action against her registration [ as a gp ] ’			0
@entity133 , chief executive of the @entity50 , said it did not normally comment unless action was taken on a case			0
however he added : ‘ what we can say in general is that doctors have access to the whole range of medications and they must exercise that privilege responsibly			0
that does not include prescribing for animals			0
’ mrs @entity23 and @entity28 declined to comment .			0
