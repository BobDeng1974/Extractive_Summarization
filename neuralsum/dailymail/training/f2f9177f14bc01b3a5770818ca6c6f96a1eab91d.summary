by @entity0 the failure of @entity3 ’s school system is putting huge strain on society by forcing businesses to turn to millions of foreign workers to fill low - skilled jobs			1
too many school leavers lack even the most basic skills to ‘ look people in the eye and get out of bed ’ , according to immigration experts			1
they are also given little incentive to work by the benefits system , the government - appointed @entity15 claimed			2
too many school leavers lack even the most basic skills to ¿ look people in the eye and get out of bed ¿ , according to immigration experts as a result , businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas who are better qualified , more reliable , confident and – unlike young @entity3 – have the good ‘ manners ’ needed to work in shops			1
however , @entity15 said there were significant downsides of adding so many foreign workers to the population since 1997 , with schools , hospitals and roads ‘ struggling to cope ’			1
in a 350 - page report , @entity15 said foreign - born workers now fill 16 per cent of low - skill jobs , compared with 7 per cent in 1997			2
at the same time , the number of @entity3 - born workers in low - skilled jobs has fallen by around one million			1
it blamed a target - driven regime that is interested only in the academically gifted , at the expense of the less able			0
there are now around 1.3million 16 - to 24 - year - olds who are not in full - time education or working , of whom around 600,000 have no ‘ identifiable barrier ’ to employment			1
where they are @entity53 the panel also confirmed the wages of the low - paid @entity3 who do have jobs have been driven down , and cohesion and national ‘ wellbeing ’ are suffering			1
there is also evidence that , in areas where there has been a large influx of migrants , house prices are falling as @entity3 people choose to move out			1
the @entity15 , headed by sir @entity67 , carried out an investigation of the impact of low - skilled workers on @entity3 life and the reasons so many have arrived			1
between 1997 and 2013 there was a 1.1million expansion in the low - skilled immigrant workforce , filling jobs in shops , factories and processing plants , and taking the total to 2.1million			2
one million of them have come in the past ten years , half from central and eastern @entity83			0
@entity15 said it did not believe the ‘ recent deterioration in the youth labour market was a direct consequence of increased competition for jobs following the inflow of migrant workers , especially after 2004 ’			1
sir @entity67 instead laid much of the blame at the door of the education system , which focused on the brightest students , to the detriment of the less academically gifted			0
he said : ‘ schools presently have an incentive to boost the number of a * - c grades in gcse exams			2
‘ this may imply insufficient attention is given to those towards the bottom of the ability range			0
many apprenticeships do not stretch the individual sufficiently and have too little employer input			0
‘ @entity111 attention needs to be given to raising the awareness of , and adjusting aspirations towards , available opportunities and improving the soft skills of those at the lower end of the ability range			0
’ the committee interviewed a string of major employers who suggested that migrant workers meet their requirements , ‘ while @entity3 workers either do not or would not apply for the job in the first place ’			1
sir @entity67 said many school leavers lack even the ability to ‘ look people in the eye and get out of bed in the morning ’			1
last night , immigration minister @entity134 told the @entity135 : ‘ this report is a depressing indictment of @entity139 ’s record , not just on immigration but right across the board : an education system that failed to equip too many people for the world of work , a skills policy that failed to help people with basic literacy and numeracy , and a welfare system that failed to help people off the dole			1
‘ the result was a reliance on low - skilled migrant labour and an immigration system that was out of control			0
‘ this is why it ’s so important for government not just to reduce and control immigration , but to reform schools , reform welfare and get more people into training and apprenticeships			0
’ the @entity15 report said it had found no significant evidence of migrants forcing @entity3 out of the jobs market or leading to a rise in crime			1
but it concluded that the winners of mass immigration were the migrants themselves , who earn higher wages than are available at home			0
their impact on gdp per head , productivity and prices – the crucial battleground between the two sides in the immigration debate – was ‘ very modest ’			2
in response , sir @entity187 of @entity188 said : ‘ this is a remarkably comprehensive report			0
it finds that the impact of low - skilled immigration on both gdp per head and productivity is “ tiny ”			0
‘ it also acknowledges additional pressures on housing , health and education			0
so one has to ask why some people are so keen to promote mass immigration in the teeth of public opinion			0
’ the @entity15 also warned that future expansion of the @entity207 must be handled @entity208 in schools are a recurring concern among business leaders , several of whom have publicly aired their views			0
sir @entity214 , the former @entity215 boss , said too many school leavers struggled with reading , writing and arithmetic			0
the experts found wages of the @entity3 low - paid have been driven down and there is little enforcement of the payment of the minimum wage to migrants			2
overall , just a quarter of councils have absorbed three - quarters of the 2.9million rise in the non-uk born population since 2001 , putting pressure on education , health , and the housing market and potential problems around ‘ cohesion , integration and wellbeing ’			2
the biggest increases have come in @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244			0
the report said the composition of many local areas had ‘ altered rapidly ’ creating ‘ congestion ’			2
this includes pressure on maternity services , transport and schools , particularly from ‘ churning ’ , where the children of migrant workers arrive or leave mid-term .			1

businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas
they are better qualified , more reliable and confident
young @entity3 do not have the good ‘ manners ’ needed to work in shops
