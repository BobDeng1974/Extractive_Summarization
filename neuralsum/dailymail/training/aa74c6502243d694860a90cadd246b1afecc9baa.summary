by @entity1 reporter it ’s cricket mating season in @entity4 and unusually massive swarms of the frisky bugs are terrorizing the state ’s residents			1
not only does the field cricket have a noxious odor and shrieking chirp , it has a tendency toward cannibalism so killing them only makes things worse			1
residents say the insects tend to congregate and feed on carcasses of their dead brethren , but they ’re covering every street , sidewalk , and building so there ’s no way to avoid the occasional crunch			2
@entity39 user furiousd caught this particularly nasty pile of cricket carcasses the more they ’re stomped , worse infestations around homes and businesses become			1
‘ i think we are going to see a little more before it gets any better , ’ @entity46 ’s @entity45 told @entity47			2
experts say weather could be the cause of the usually large swarm			2
‘ these outbreaks seem to occur after periods of prolonged dry weather in spring and early summer followed by rainfall in july and august , ’ said @entity54 , director of the @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity46			2
‘ extensive soil cracking may be an important factor			2
’ bad year : the crickets come out every year , but the weather allowed an unusually large number to emerge from their burrows to mate this season			1
here , the critters congregate at a gas station			2
unavoidable : a thick carpet of the field crickets can be found all across @entity4 on streets , sidewalks , and buildings and stepping on them only attracts more cannibals : experts say the crickets are attracted to the bodies of their dead relatives , so crushing the bugs only makes the problem worse			1
here , a pile up can be seen near a shady set of stairs			2
' a plague has arrived ' : according to @entity54 of @entity46 's @entity88 department			2
adult crickets can be very difficult to control field crickets are found throughout the @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 states , but @entity4 has a special relationship with the chirping creature			1
at the end of every summer , the the inch - long crickets come out en masse to mate in the @entity4			1
july and august rains likely trigger this emergence , but experts are saying this year 's population explosion is the result of a particularly nasty drought followed by an unusually moist wet season			1
when residents try to squash the bugs , things can get even worse			0
according to @entity46 's @entity45 , other crickets swarm the bodies of the fallen comrades for a cannibalistic feast			0
the current brood will eventually die off once they 've all mated			0
but not before they 've laid eggs into the ground , thus planting the seed for next year 's generation			0
unfortunately for @entity4 residents , that wo n't happen for a while yet			1
experts say this year 's onslaught will likely last longer than usual and the state must still endure around 8 more weeks of the chirping plague			0
the crickets lay their eggs and crawl out en masse once it ’s time for mating			1
and though the creatures can be tough to get rid of , experts suggest a few tricks that might ease the problem somewhat			0
‘ crickets commonly spend the daylight hours hiding in dark , damp areas			0
eliminating piles of bricks , stones , wood or other debris around the home will help reduce numbers , ’ said @entity54			0
‘ aerosols applied to baseboards , door thresholds and cracks and crevices where crickets hide will normally control them			0
’ in addition to incessant chirping that can last deep into the night and early morning , some residents say the crickets even stink			0
' after a while they all start dying and it gets to get this rotted meat smell , ' one resident told @entity161			0
' i will not be sleeping tonight ' : the crickets stick to walls , crunch underfoot wherever residents walk , and hang from walls and window screens , making just looking outside a little bit creepy invasion of crickets ! ' these outbreaks seem to occur after periods of prolonged dry weather in spring and early summer followed by rainfall in july and august , ' said @entity54 thick as thieves : the crickets like to congregate in damp , cool places and experts say to remove debris that could offer such environs from around your home			1
' large amounts of crickets are gross ! ' says @entity39 user xnebulousxz they eventually die back , but that wo n’t be for another eight weeks or so			0
‘ i think we are going to see a little more before it gets any better , ’ @entity45 said			0
in the meantime , all residents are left to do is complain and post nauseating photos to their social media streams			0
takeover : ' crickets have taken over weatherford ! ! ! ' writes @entity39 user rscarbrough13 creepy crawly ! the bugs are teeming in @entity4 and the problem could continue for the next eight weeks ' just a small glimpse ' : @entity202 are accustomed to the bugs coming out once a year , but most ca n't remember a time when the problem was this bad along with up close and personal photos of their cricket experiences , @entity39 users had plenty to say about the ' # invasion			1
' ' when i look out my window , this is what i see			0
needless to say i will not be sleeping tonight , ' writes @entity214 with a photo of her cricket - covered window screen			1
' a plague has arrived in @entity219 , ' writes colleendamager			0
@entity221 asked , ' crickets , anyone ? ' user xnebulousx may have siad it best : ' large amounts of crickets are gross ! ' when crickets attack : the creepy crawlies blanket this @entity4 parking lot as @entity39 user rstucker185 pauses to take a pic ' this is not okay ! ' the crickets are n't shy about clinging to people 's homes			1
experts warn homeowners to spray insect killer around doors and windows to prevent a domestic invasion ' crickets , anyone ? ' here , crickets can be seen congregating on a moist spot on a wall			1
experts say the invasion was started by a wet july and august and will continue for weeks			1
