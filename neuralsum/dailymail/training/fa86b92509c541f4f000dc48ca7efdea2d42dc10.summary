@entity0 fears the lingering impact of @entity3 ’s three - match ban will continue to haunt @entity4 in the @entity5			1
@entity3 returns against @entity6 in the @entity7 on tuesday night but , rather than accepting he will be fresh and ready for action , @entity0 predicts his 17 - goal top - scorer will be off the pace after three weeks out			1
' i will start him , ' said @entity0			1
' but i do n’t think it ’s good for a player to be three weeks , three matches without starting a game			2
i do n’t think he will be in the best condition			2
@entity3 will start for @entity4 in the @entity5 against @entity6 @entity4 boss @entity0 at his side 's press conference ahead of the trip to @entity6 on tuesday ' also , @entity21 and @entity22 have played in the last three matches and it is important for them to have minutes , and i am confident i have them both ready for the game too			1
' @entity28 and @entity29 are many people 's favourites heading into the last 16 , but @entity0 disagrees , suggesting that the competition is more than capable of throwing up the unexpected			1
he said : ' i do n't agree at all ( that they 're favourites ) , because the @entity5 always has space for surprises			1
' you go through the last decade and see teams winning the competition who you expect to win , but you also have teams you do n't expect to win			2
you can balance it almost 50 - 50			2
' you have three or four teams people would not be waiting for			0
i really do n't know the candidates when it goes to the knockout stage			0
at the moment there are 16 candidates for me			0
' @entity47 ( left ) scored as @entity6 beat @entity4 3 - 1 in the first leg of their encounter last season @entity51 scores the last - gasp goal for @entity4 that knocked @entity6 out of the quarter - finals last year @entity4 beat @entity6 in the quarter - finals of last season 's competition , losing the first leg 3 - 1 in @entity58 before going on to secure qualification on away goals at @entity61 thanks to a last - minute goal from @entity51			1
and @entity0 is more than aware of just how fine the margins were last time			2
' we beat them but we lost in @entity58 and it was decided in the last minute , ' he said			0
' the details make the difference			0
i ’m not saying we won because we were better than @entity58			0
we won because we scored away and did not concede at home			0
' @entity58 is a great team and basically the same as last season with @entity73 , same coach , same dynamic , same profile , with conditions to be better because when you have stability you can improve			0
' @entity4 have different players			2
we change the profile of our game			0
i do n’t want to say we ’re better but @entity7 will see a different @entity4 to last season			1
' @entity73 is set to line up for @entity6 against his former club @entity4 on tuesday night @entity73 holds off a challenge from @entity85 midfielder @entity84 in @entity6 's 2 - 2 draw in @entity87 at the weekend @entity73 played in both legs against @entity6 for @entity4 last season , before switching to the @entity89 last summer			1
the @entity92 defender implied that @entity4 were the stronger team going into the tie , a suggestion dismissed out of hand by @entity0			1
' i ’m not here to comment on words from opponents , even @entity73 ( @entity96 ) , ' he insisted			0
' i ’m not going to comment			0
