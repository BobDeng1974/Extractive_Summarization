by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 21 november 2013 now seven months pregnant , the @entity1 might have expected all eyes to be on her sizeable bump			1
but windy weather and her flimsy outfit had other ideas			0
@entity1 was left red - faced after the gusts lifted up her £ 38 polka - dot dress , drawing attention instead to her thighs			1
the royal mother - to - be was caught out by the wind as she arrived at the wedding of friends @entity15 and @entity16 , in south @entity17 , just over a week ago			1
whoops : a seven months pregnant @entity1 was hit by an unfortunate gust of wind which blew up her skirt and exposed her thighs seemingly unaware that her skirt had blown up , revealing her shapely legs , she gripped her black and white fascinator rather than her hem , laughing as she did so			1
it happened as she walked towards @entity26 , in the village of @entity28 in the @entity29 , on saturday , may 11			2
the duchess appeared not to have learned her lesson from the last time she wore the @entity33 dress , when she suffered a similar wardrobe malfunction			1
having fun : the royal couple arrived separately at @entity26 , in the village of @entity28 in the @entity29 she was forced to hold down the back of the black and cream outfit as she arrived at the @entity40 - based @entity39 with princes @entity41 and @entity42 , last month			1
the @entity44 bargain sold out within hours of her wearing it , but the dress may not get a third showing after proving unsuitable for the gusty @entity50 weather once again			2
@entity1 attended the wedding with prince @entity41 , who arrived separately and was believed to have been an usher , wearing the same morning suit , blue striped shirt , and dark red tie as the groom			1
gusty : the wind in @entity17 first showed the @entity60 's growing bump before it lifted her flimsy dress , although @entity1 did n't seem too worried as she walked with a male companion arriving alone : @entity1 attended the wedding with prince @entity41 , who arrived separately and was believed to have been an usher the couple have known the @entity15 family for many years and the groom 's niece , @entity67 , was a flower girl at the royal wedding			1
famous : @entity72 's dress blows up in the 1955 movie ' @entity74 ' @entity1 's embarrassing moment , reminiscent of @entity72 in film @entity74 , was one of several for the duchess			1
in july 2011 , during a @entity85 tour , her cream and navy cable - knit @entity80 dress was whipped up by the wind as she met wellwishers in @entity88 , in @entity89			2
on that occasion she was wearing a cream slip , which protected her modesty			0
she was not so lucky four days later as her yellow @entity94 dress flew up on the tarmac at @entity97 airport , briefly revealing her underwear			2
but the duchess , who is expected to give birth on july 13 , handled all the mishaps with her usual poise			2
the exact due date had been shrouded in secrecy , but close friends of the royal couple discussed at a barbecue hosted by a family friend that @entity1 expects to go into labour on july 13 - during the @entity111 's @entity110			2
for the first time , 50 per cent said @entity113 would be a fitting monarch in the @entity115 poll , up 13 per cent from may last year			0
the @entity113 was seen as making a positive contribution to the monarchy by 60 per cent of voters			0
the poll showed , for the first time , a majority believe the @entity111 should abdicate if she becomes too ill to fulfil her duties			0
happy couple : @entity1 and @entity41 were at the wedding to support @entity123 and @entity16 troubles : @entity1 also had problems on her @entity85 tour with @entity41 in 2011 , when the wind blew up her dress twice in four day on saturday , @entity129 made an obligatory appearance at a scoiety wedding			1
but the happy couple ’s choice of toast was more suited to @entity135 is @entity136 than its higher - class @entity138 counterpart			0
guests toasted the bride and groom with @entity142 , a vodka alcopop flavoured with lemon , and knocked back gin shots before the service , according to onlookers			0
@entity148 of @entity150 ’s little sister attended the wedding of @entity152 and @entity153 at the @entity154 and @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157			0
showing off her famous figure in a skin - tight pale pink £ 370 @entity163 @entity162 dress , she looked stylish and svelte as she posed for the cameras			0
cream delight : @entity129 made an entrance wearing a feminine lacy dress by @entity163			0
the £ 370 silk dress featured a chiffon top with a seahorse pattern while the skirt was made from cream lace dates : the 29 - year - old arrived at the @entity154 and @entity155 with her date , banker @entity176 ( left ) , 34 , and younger brother @entity177 ( right ) should n't that be champagne ? @entity152 and her husband were seen clutching @entity142 alcopops as they left the church			0
