when you hit the spot , nothing feels better than scratching an itch			2
and it seems this black bear has done just that			1
throwing its head back , it wiggles wildly up and down a tree in @entity10 , @entity11 - apparently dancing that niggling feeling away			1
the animal , one of just 25,000 of its kind , is caught in the act leaning against the bark of a tree in the sprawling woods			1
lost in the rhythm , it stamps its foot while lunging up and down in a circular motion			0
maximum extension : it throws itself int the air to build momentum as it appears to be enjoying it and back down again : it pounds its paw down on the floor to rub its neck against the bark here we go again : the bear , one of just 25,000 of its kind , then swings back around to start the move again at one point , it slows down , seemingly savoring the moment - before whirling its head around again and getting right back into the swing of it			1
and then - out of the blue - it stops , jumps to its feet , and looks alert as if nothing had ever happened			0
@entity64 users rushed to comment on the adorable video , taken on september 21			0
delightful : the video , by @entity11 wildlife wardens , has been a hit on @entity64 with hundreds commenting who 's there ? then , as if nothing had happened , the bear jumps up alert looking around coolly and calmly one commenter wrote : ' that is so cute ! ' another said : ' i think i 'll have to try that when i 'm next in the woods			2
' and one commented : ' definitely needs to be set to music ... he 's got some mad skills			0
