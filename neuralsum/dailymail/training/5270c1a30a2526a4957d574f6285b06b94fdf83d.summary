the former chief executive of the @entity8 said the party ’s rock - bottom showing in last week ’s @entity12 poll – where it came fifth with less than 1 per cent of the vote – was ‘ unacceptable ’			2
and he warned that the latest failure makes the chances of the @entity8 holding on to dozens of seats at the next general election much harder			2
@entity0 ’s barbed accusation that the @entity8 are now just a minor party will be seen as revenge on mr @entity1 for not allowing him back into the heart of the party			1
the @entity8 peer , who was the party ’s chief executive between 2003 and 2009 , was suspended early this year after a series of women accused him of making sexual advances			1
he denied the allegations , but issued an apology for encroaching on some of the women ’s ‘ personal space ’			0
in august the suspension was controversially lifted – although he was told he would have no role in next year ’s election campaign			0
last week the @entity8 candidate in @entity12 and @entity39 , @entity38 , recorded the worst result of any major party since the war , garnering just 0.9 per cent of the vote and coming fifth behind the @entity44			1
@entity46 ’s @entity45 won the seat			0

lord @entity0 – who notched up a string of by - election victories as strategy chief in the 1990s – made his comments in a blog on @entity57 , entitled reflections on @entity12			2
@entity0 ’s barbed accusation that the @entity8 are now just a minor party will be seen as revenge on mr @entity1 for not allowing him back into the heart of the party he said the ‘ result was not in my opinion unavoidable ’			1
he added : ‘ we should not allow such a result ever again , because polling the lowest vote of any major party , in any by - election ever , casts doubt on our status as a “ major party ”			1
’ @entity0 also criticised those in the @entity8 who fail to grasp the enormity of the crisis engulfing the party by suggesting ‘ we have been here before ’			1
‘ no we have n’t , ’ he said			0
‘ not in terms of parliamentary by - elections in @entity80 anyway			0
’ he added : ‘ to avoid such results as @entity12 again , the party must change its approach to such by - elections , and to all the various sets of elections in which we need to try and sustain our support and build again for the future			0
’ @entity1 has hinted that he would be prepared to form a three - party @entity90 of @entity92 , the @entity8 and the @entity93			1
the surge in support for the @entity97 north of the border has prompted speculation that a ‘ rainbow coalition ’ made up of several parties may be needed after next may ’s poll			0
