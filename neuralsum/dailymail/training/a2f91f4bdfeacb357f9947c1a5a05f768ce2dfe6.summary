the @entity2 could survive without @entity3 but not @entity4 , outgoing @entity1 chief @entity0 has claimed			1
bowing out as @entity5 claimed a @entity7 exit would only ' wound ' the @entity2 project , but the departure of @entity4 would leave it ' dead '			1
and he mocked @entity12 's claim to have vetoed an @entity2 budget rise in 2011			1
the prime minister is expected to use a major speech within days to announce @entity20 plans to curb immigration from the rest of @entity23 , including limiting the total number which can come to @entity3			2
however , he has clashed with senior @entity1 figures and other @entity2 leaders over any attempt to alter the principle of freedom of movement			1
in a farewell lecture in @entity31 today , mr @entity0 said he believed the other 27 member states would be ready to look seriously at @entity34 's demands for change			0
but he insisted that the fundamental principles of the @entity2 were not open to negotiation			2
speaking at the @entity38 of @entity39 last night , mr @entity0 said : ' without the @entity7 , @entity23 would be wounded , even amputated - therefore everything should be done to avoid it			1
without @entity4 , @entity23 - the @entity23 idea - would be dead			0
' looking ahead to mr @entity12 's promised renegotiation and referendum , the @entity45 president said : ' this is primarily a @entity7 debate			1
it is for the @entity7 people to decide			2
' i think that the @entity23 partners would be ready seriously to examine those demands which are important for @entity34 , but not to negotiate on the fundamental principles of our @entity2			0
' however , he took a swipe at mr @entity12 's claim to have vetoed a 2011 treaty change to tackle the euro crisis , describing it as ' an unfortunate attempt at a veto '			2

' for my part , i have never had anything to complain about from the @entity7			0
their government has been constructive in the major negotiations on the @entity23 budget , on the climate or on our strategic agenda for 2014 - 19			0
' and often it has pulled others forwards , on the single market or on certain foreign affairs issues - @entity94 , @entity95			0
' of course , the @entity7 is not part of the largest project - the euro - nor in the @entity99 area			2
but @entity34 has never prevented us from moving forwards			0
' admittedly , there was an unfortunate attempt at a veto in december 2011 , but on banking union - the most important integrationist move since the birth of the euro - @entity3 has been very constructive , and rightly so , because community legislation was necessary			0
