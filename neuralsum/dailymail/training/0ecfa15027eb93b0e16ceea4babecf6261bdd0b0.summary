their two sons and one daughter were born in the @entity59 , but they had precious little money and @entity66 endured ' private horrors ' from her husband in addition to battling her own mental problems			0
their father left their home in the rough neighborhood of @entity73 and when he died he left a wife who could not speak @entity96 and children who could barely speak @entity98			1
however , the sliver of hope for @entity24 and @entity2 was that they found themselves attending the famous @entity71 - the first public school and oldest existing school in the @entity59 , where @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 studied			1
successful studies : @entity2 , ( left ) , sits in a @entity108 at @entity71 in @entity11 , in @entity11 , @entity109 two years ago almost to this day prestige for the hardworking : @entity71 has seen students such as @entity114 's father @entity113 and five of the 65 founding father 's walk its halls their academic excellence carried them to the notice of @entity41 , who became intrigued by the daily dedication of @entity24 , then 17 and @entity2 , then 15 , to making the most of the slim opportunities afforded them			1

that ’s my only option			0

setting the @entity144 alight : @entity41 live tweeted the admission of his protegé into @entity6 today and could n't have been prouder admitted : @entity2 took to @entity12 to announce that he had indeed made it to @entity6 - after years of hard work with encouragement only from one or two others - including his brother and reporter @entity41 @entity41 took them to the presses to be handed the first edition and realized after the piece that he could not now leave them to their lives			1
' i stayed close to the boys , party out of an obligation , but mostly because i cared about them			0
and they were fun , ' said the father - of - two			0
becoming something of a mentor to the boys , @entity41 paid for dinners where he caught up with their lives and even helped bring a fridge to the dorm of @entity24 when he became a freshman at @entity56			0
next step : while his brother is currently studying at the no-less prestigious @entity175 is to start courses next year at @entity48 school @entity6 the story did not stop there			2
@entity41 assisted @entity2 with his school work and encouraged him to aim as high as his grades and ability suggested he could go			0
and then today , in an emotional volley of tweets , @entity41 revealed that the youngest @entity2 had gained admission to @entity6 and as icing on the cake - had his braces removed			1
admitting to crying on @entity12 , @entity41 then revealed he was to take out @entity2 for a slap - up meal to celebrate			2
' and we 've ended up at @entity189 ! seems fitting for a @entity73 kid made good to celebrate with a burger cooked by a @entity192			0
