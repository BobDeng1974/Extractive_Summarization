a tattooed princess preserved in permafrost after 2,500 years is to be reinterred amid fears her upheaval sparked a series of natural disasters			1
the mummified remains of the @entity8 ice maiden were discovered 21 years ago in a high altitude plateau in the heart of south - western @entity11			1
but her removal led to concern among local elders who called for her to be put back in her final resting place to ' stop her anger that caused floods and earthquakes '			1
now the @entity36 has reported plans have finally been put forward to reinter the body back into the ground in the @entity8 's @entity39 and honour her with her own special mausoleum			1

archaeologists also found ornaments made from felt , wood , bronze and gold as well as a small container of cannabis and a stone plate on which coriander seeds were burned			0
from her clothes and possessions including a ' cosmetics bag ' , scientists were able to recreate her fashion and beauty secrets			0
she was dressed in a long shirt made from @entity79 silk , and had long felt sleeve boots with a beautiful decoration on them			0
at this time @entity79 silk was only ever found in royal burials of the @entity86 people , and since it was more expensive than gold it gave an indication of her wealth and status			0
elders in the @entity39 have long called for the mummified remains to be reburied on the @entity95 plateau elders insisted that the worst flooding in 50 years in @entity39 and a series of earthquakes were caused by the dead princess her head was completely shaved , and she wore a horse hair wig on top of which was a carving of a wooden deer			1
the princess 's face and neck skin was not preserved , but the skin of her left arm survived			1
but the most exciting discovery was her elaborate body art , which many observers said bore striking similarities to modern - day tattoos			0
on her left shoulder was a fantastical mythological animal made up of a deer with a griffon 's beak and a @entity125 s antlers			2
the antlers themselves were decorated with the heads of griffons			0
the mouth of a spotted panther with a long tail could also be seen , and she had a deer 's head on her wrist			2
