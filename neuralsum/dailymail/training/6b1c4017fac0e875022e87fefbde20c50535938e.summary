by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 18 september 2012 it has been perhaps the biggest phenomenon to ever hit the @entity2 , influencing everything from celebrity culture to politics to international relations			0
but the site itself has changed little since launch - the @entity8 team perhaps cautious of the criticism @entity10 gets when it revamps a feature			1
but today @entity8 announced its biggest overhaul since its launch in 2006 , in particular introducing a ' cover photo ' to your user account , which will be seen by your followers whether they visit your page on the web , by mobile or by tablet			1
the change brings @entity8 a little closer to @entity10 in terms of having a profile and a cover image , perhaps signalling @entity8 's intent as it continues pushing forward			2
@entity8 2.0 : @entity31 tv host @entity30 , who helped announce the changes , shows off the new profile picture the old style : @entity35 , one of @entity8 's biggest users , is yet to update , giving us a glimpse of the ' old ' @entity8 @entity8 is a cultural phenomenon , with more than 140 million users , 340 million tweets sent every day , and a valuation of $ 8bn			0
however , it is still a @entity44 to @entity10 's @entity45 , which has a billion users , and a $ 100billion stock market flotation under its belt - indeed , the valuation went up by the same amount as @entity8 's total value after a speech by @entity53 last week			2
but @entity8 has taken the headlines over the last few years , adored by celebrities and their legions of fans			0
with internet users migrating towards a more mobile environment , @entity8 has also completely revamped its @entity61 and phone apps , bringing additional features to what were previously quite basic apps			1
founded : 2006 number of users : 140million value : $ 8billion key founder : @entity68 best known for : short communications , celebrity updates , contact with companies founded : 2004 number of users : ~ one billion value : $ 100billion key founder : @entity53 best known for : staying in touch with friends and family , sharing images experts say the firm is also trying to boost the number of people using its mobile apps following competition from third party apps such as @entity87			2
' @entity8 is trying to push people towards their mobile apps , ' said @entity90 of web site @entity91			0
' @entity10 has had cover pictures for a while , but @entity8 has also had the ability to change your page - it 's just not many people used it			2
' new profile pictures : the @entity61 app has been 're - built ' and will also support the new profile images announcing the changes on @entity8 's blog , the team said : ' starting today you can make your presence on @entity8 more meaningful with new @entity8 profiles			0
' upload an all - new header photo on mobile apps for @entity61 , @entity111 and @entity112 or twitter.com , and the same image will appear whenever anyone views your profile on the web or these apps			1
' you can upload your header photo , which appears above your tweets , to express yourself instantly , anywhere			0
' welcome to the family : @entity8 are showing off ( from left to right ) their new desktop version , and new versions for the @entity61 , @entity111 and @entity112 handsets other changes include photo streams that now appear below anyone â€™s most recent tweets on @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity61 , which can be swiped through to see the photos of other users			1
celebrities such as @entity30 have already updated their profiles , having helped launched the changes on @entity31 's @entity135			0
the new versions of the apps bring in the website - based changes , such as the header photos , and there are also more options for updating your profile .			1

each user can now have a ' cover photo ' *similar* to the recently - added feature on @entity10
new @entity61 , @entity111 and @entity112 apps bring new features to mobile users
