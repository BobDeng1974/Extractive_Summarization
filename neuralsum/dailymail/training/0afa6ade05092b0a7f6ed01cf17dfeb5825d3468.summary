starting piano lessons before the age of seven may turbo - charge the brain			2
a study found that learning to play a musical instrument seems to strengthen the brain – with the biggest benefits found in those who began lessons while still very young			1
the researchers said : ‘ early musical training does more good for kids than just making it easier for them to enjoy music			0
beneficial : starting piano lessons before the age of seven may turbo - charge the brain , a study has found ‘ it changes their brain and these brain changes could lead to cognitive advances as well			1
’ the @entity25 researchers studied the brains of 48 men and women aged between 19 and 21			1
all had done at least a year of music practice , with some starting as young as three			0
parts of the brain key to language , planning and time management appeared to be stronger in those who started younger			0
positive : researchers found that learning to play a musical instrument seems to strengthen the brain - particularly in those who began lessons young plus regions involved in hearing sound and in self - awareness were bigger			1
the finding held true even when the number of years spent practising was taken into account , the @entity47 ’s annual conference heard			0
the researchers , from @entity52 , said that some of the brain regions impacted by music develop rapidly early in life			2
research released last week revealed that music lessons are n’t wasted , with adults who had n’t played an instrument since childhood benefiting from practice put in decades earlier			1
the @entity64 study showed that the more years that adults had spent practising an musical instrument in their youth , the faster the cells in their brains responded to sound			2
faster processing of sound should help keep hearing sharp into old age by making it easier to make out a conversation over background noise , or to hear clearly while talking on the phone			0
all instruments , from the piano to accordion helped equally			0
other studies have shown that learning a musical instrument can boost @entity83 , make it easier to pick up new languages and interpret the emotions of others			0
but while music lessons in general seem to be beneficial , it is thought that those who enjoy learning an instrument reap the biggest benefits .			1

learning to play an instrument strengthens the brain , a study has found
biggest benefits are found in those who began music lessons in childhood
