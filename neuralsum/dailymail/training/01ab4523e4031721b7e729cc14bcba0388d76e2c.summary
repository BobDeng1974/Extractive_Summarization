by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 08:13 est , 3 january 2014 two friends who served together during the @entity3 have been reunited 70 years later after a chance encounter revealed they were living just 12 miles from each other			1
@entity6 and @entity7 were radar operators for the @entity9 when they were both teenagers , and became close friends serving at a station in @entity12			1
however , they lost touch towards the end of the war - and although they tried to contact each other during the following decades , they never managed to get in touch			2
but when mrs @entity6 , 89 , from @entity22 in @entity23 , was reading her local newspaper she noticed an appeal for information about a former @entity28 base in @entity29			1
together again : @entity6 , left , and @entity30 , right , have been reunited after 70 years friends : the pair - then known as @entity33 , left , and @entity34 , right - pictured during the war although she did not know that base , she made contact with the enthusiast who placed the advert on the off - chance that some of her former colleagues might have served there			2
she was particularly keen to find her old friend @entity34 - but when she was given a phone number for @entity7 , who she was told lived near her , she had no idea they were the same person			0
mrs @entity6 called the number and asked , ' do you know of a @entity34 ? ' - only to be told , ' that 's me ! ' the day of the pair 's first conversation happened to be mrs @entity7 's 90th birthday , and came 70 years after they had last seen each other			1
the two women , then aged just 17 and 18 , first met at @entity63 in @entity64 after volunteering for the @entity9			0
coincidence : the woman realised that they lived just 12 miles apart in @entity23 thanks to a newspaper ad they were transferred together to radar operations in @entity12 , but lost contact when they moved to different parts of the country			1
the younger woman , then known as @entity33 , met her future husband @entity75 while they were both being de-mobbed at the end of the war			0
@entity34 also changed her surname when she married , and started calling herself @entity7 because other relatives shared her first name			0
mrs @entity6 was so keen to trace her friend that she once called every number listed under ' greener ' in her local phonebook			0
when the pair - now both widowed - finally made contact again , mrs @entity6 was so excited she immediately travelled to mrs @entity90 's @entity89 home via bus and taxi			1
memories : the pair have enjoyed reminiscing about their wartime experiences with the @entity9 her first sight of her old friend was of her waiting on the street outside her house			0
' i think i could have walked past her on the street , but she 's still lovely and thin , ' mrs @entity6 said			2
once the pair started talking about their time in the @entity9 , they could not stop reminding each other of all their unusual experiences			0
both vividly remembered typing out messages on rice paper , which would be given to pilots so they could recognise beacon signals and then eat their instructions if they were captured			0
mrs @entity6 said : ' @entity7 told me , " i used to eat it ! " as we did n't get sweets very much - they were rationed - and i said , " that 's what i used to do ! " ' hard at work : a group of other @entity9 workers pictured during the war working at a radar station they also recalled circling the perimeter of the airfield , attaching metallic strips to planes in order to interfere with enemy radar			1
' @entity130 would get taken around in a van as she was smaller than me and could n't reach up - and i had to cycle , ' mrs @entity6 said			2
her daughter @entity134 , who was present during a second meeting between the pair , said they were soon laughing so much that they appeared to be shaking in photographs			0
the two old friends now intend to keep in regular contact - and mrs @entity6 is keen to get in touch with other former colleagues too .			1

@entity6 , 89 , and @entity7 , 90 , served together as teenagers
the close friends lost touch after the war and never saw each other again
but mrs @entity6 *responded* to a newspaper ad appealing for information
she did n't recognise mrs @entity7 's name because she has since married - but it soon *emerged* the pair lived 12 miles apart in @entity23
