by @entity0 astronauts on the moon and @entity3 could soon have fresh food to eat , thanks to a radical new ' space greenhouse '			1
@entity8 researchers are testing the system , which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer			1
they hope to build a complete greenhouse in @entity13 to test the first space garden in 2016			1
engineer @entity15 holds lettuce at the @entity17 on july 21 , 2014 in @entity18 , @entity8 : researchers hope their system could allow astronauts on the moon and @entity3 to grow their own food			1
the system could eventually be used to create a greenhouse on the lunar surface the greenhouses will contain combined life - support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer , helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and @entity3 environment			1
it also uses specially developed purple led lighting to boost growth rates			0
the system is being developed at the @entity17 in @entity18 , and is called @entity35 ( @entity37 - closed nutrition sources )			0
funded by the @entity39 , the greenhouses will contain combined life - support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer , helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and @entity3 environment			1
the first greenhouse will be tested for nine months in 2016/17 in an inhospitable environment in the @entity45			0
this research initiative focuses on bioregenerative life support systems , especially greenhouse modules and technologies for future human habitats in remote locations in space ( the @entity54 , @entity3 ) and on @entity55 ( @entity45 ) , the team say			2
' one of our projects is to test a greenhouse module at the @entity60 in @entity45 , where the winter team stays in total isolation for nine months in a row in a hostile environment , ' said @entity17 research engineer @entity65			2
engineer @entity15 measures the size of a cucumber at the @entity17 , where scientists and engineers from the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) are developing greenhouses for a potential @entity3 colony			0
the first greenhouse will be tested for nine months in 2016/17 in an inhospitable environment in the @entity45			0
' we want to find ways to meet the group â€™s needs when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables but it will also enable us to study the psychological influence of plants on human isolation			0
' ' ultimately this analog test site will enable to generate good research data for future human space exploration and in extension human settlement in the solar system			2
the greenhouses will contain combined life - support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer , helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and @entity3 environment			1
engineer @entity15 holds lettuce at the @entity17 - and astronauts on @entity3 could soon be using the same system to grow food ' naturally , space travel is interesting in itself , but it is equally important for us to be involved in this project in order to demonstrate that our technology is the light system of choice for plant science research , ' said @entity110 of @entity111 , which manufactures the led lights in the system			0
' we want to be a part of developing the plant growing opportunities of the future , whether it is here on earth or in space .			0
