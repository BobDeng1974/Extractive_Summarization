by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 20:13 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 3 december 2013 poised : @entity1 is set to approve a £ 1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the government 's controversial spending target @entity1 is poised to approve a £ 1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the government ’s controversial spending target			1
the chancellor has cheered @entity11 backbenchers in recent years by repeatedly cutting the foreign aid budget to ensure it does not exceed @entity15 ’s pledge to devote 0.7 per cent of @entity17 ’s income to the issue			1
but better than expected growth figures mean that when he makes his @entity20 on the economy on thursday , mr @entity1 is facing the prospect of having to increase foreign aid in order to hit the spending threshold			1
the money involved is expected to total around £ 1billion over the next five years , although the chancellor is understood to have avoided the need to provide extra cash in this financial year			1
the move will fuel criticism that the ‘ arbitrary ’ aid target is more about political posturing than saving lives			1
in august it emerged that @entity37 , which will receive £ 1.14billion in foreign aid from @entity17 over the five years of the @entity39 , is spending millions to put a man in space			1
the oil - rich country is also mired in corruption			0
estimates suggest between £ 2.5 and £ 5billion is stolen from the state ’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians			2
@entity17 is also spending about £ 280million a year on aid to @entity51 , another country with its own space programme			1
last night @entity11 mp @entity53 described the increase as ‘ absurd ’			1
he said : ‘ the aid budget is going to go up , not because there is more need for it or more poverty in the world , but because we have got better economic growth – it is a nonsense			2
this is why these arbitrary targets are such a mistake			0
' we are still borrowing billions a month but , because growth has gone up , we are going to borrow even more so that we can give it away			0
oil - rich : @entity37 will receive £ 1.14billion in foreign aid from @entity17 over the five years of the @entity39			1
above , the @entity37 onshore oil and gas refinery at @entity69 in the delta of the @entity71 in @entity37 pledge : @entity15 , left , pledged to hit the aid target as part of a pre-election strategy to ' decontaminate ' his party 's uncaring image , while @entity11 mp @entity53 , right , has described the increase in aid as ' absurd ' ‘ it is a bizarre and stupid approach – to be honest it ’s the sort of thing you would expect from a socialist government			1
’ mr @entity15 ’s pledge to hit the aid target was part of a pre-election strategy to ‘ decontaminate ’ the @entity86 ’ uncaring image , but he has come under pressure to drop it in the wake of the financial crisis			2
in march , mr @entity1 said the aid budget would hit £ 11.2billion this year – more than the @entity93 budget			1
aid was cut in the @entity95 , when the growth forecast for this year was reduced from 1.2 per cent to 0.6 per cent			0
experts believe the forecast is likely to be upgraded to 1.4 per cent this week , requiring the chancellor to at least reverse the march cuts , which amounted to £ 1billion over five years			1
the @entity101 declined to comment , but confirmed that the 0.7 per cent aid target will be met			2
the @entity103 also declined to comment			0
one of the biggest recipients of @entity17 aid money was last night accused of covering up allegations of corruption			2
supporters : the @entity110 's backers include @entity111 , right , and @entity113 singer @entity112 , left the @entity114 - based @entity110 , which is set to receive £ 1 billion from @entity17 over the next three years , is said to have watered down a report into corruption in one of its projects in @entity120			2
the publication of investigations into alleged fraud totalling more than £ 16.5 million in parts of @entity125 is said to have been delayed for more than a year			0
the @entity110 ’s backers include @entity126 billionaire @entity111 and celebrities such as @entity113 singer @entity112 and supermodel @entity128 , wife of former @entity131 president @entity130			0
it is one of the world ’s biggest aid organisations , with a focus on tackling malaria , tuberculosis and @entity139 in the developing world			0
it has spent £ 13.5 billion over the last decade and claims to have saved millions of lives			0
an investigation by the @entity146 ’s @entity145 programme last night made disturbing new claims about the organisation ’s attitude to fraud			0
the @entity110 said it had a ‘ zero tolerance ’ approach to corruption			0
it defended its investigation into the @entity120 project , saying : ‘ only evidence that is confirmed as fact can be included in the final version of a report			0
’ a @entity103 source said the @entity145 programme related to ‘ historic ’ allegations , and that ministers had confidence in the @entity110 .			0
