there is no such thing as being fat and healthy , scientists warn			2
they have strongly refuted suggestions that a person ’s physical fitness is more important than their weight			1
the ‘ fat and fit ’ myth has been punctured by research involving 61,000 people and covering a period from the 1950s to the present day			1
the theory was that good metabolic fitness , that is , having normal blood pressure and being able to process sugar easily , would protect people from the consequences of obesity , such as heart disease and diabetes			1
a new study by @entity24 scientists has strongly refuted suggestions that a person 's physical fitness is more important than their weight however , the new research , published in the @entity31 , found that even though high blood pressure , poor blood sugar control and high blood fats are important indicators of disease , the excess weight itself remains critical			1
seriously overweight people who displayed none of these warning signs were nonetheless found to die younger than people at a normal weight			2
@entity24 scientists , from the @entity43 at @entity44 in @entity45 , conducted a review of eight studies published from 1950 onwards to find out whether these metabolic indicators were linked to premature death and heart disease in normal - weight , overweight and obese people			1
the ' fat and fit ' myth has been punctured by research involving 61,000 people from the 1950s to the present day they classified the participants by @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , which gives weight guidelines based on height , and measured lipid profile ( blood fats ) , glucose tolerance ( sugar ) , blood pressure and waist circumference , as well as other metabolic features			1
bad results in these tests have been dubbed ‘ the metabolic syndrome ’ and increase the risk of a range of diseases			0
those supposedly ‘ fat and fit ’ have been described as having ‘ metabolically healthy obesity ’ because they do not have the metabolic syndrome			0
normal - weight individuals can also have a poor metabolic profile , such as high blood pressure or poor sugar control , despite having a healthy @entity57			1
but the study showed that obese people with a good metabolic profile were still more likely to die young or have heart problems in the long term than those of normal weight			2
the scientists also found those with metabolic syndrome were at greater risk of disease regardless of whether they were fat or not			0
dr @entity93 , a gp and medical director of the charity weight concern , said the issue was not well understood			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve read studies that suggest obesity does n’t make you die any earlier at all , and it ’s likely that genetic predisposition will play a large part in whether being overweight results in a range of diseases that may shorten your life			0
‘ many other studies conclude that overweight and obesity make you more prone to disease and premature death			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s clearly a good idea for anyone who is overweight to get as fit as possible because being more active helps in weight loss , and it mitigates the metabolic effects of being fat			0
‘ in my experience , getting exercise is the quickest way to lose weight			0

@entity24 scientists carried out research examining 61,000 people from the 1950s to the present day
the study strongly refuted the suggestion that a person 's physical fitness is more important than their weight
evidence showed despite a person having normal blood pressure and being able to process sugar easily , excess weight alone remains critical
