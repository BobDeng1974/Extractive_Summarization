@entity0 battered @entity1 from pillar to post before the referee belatedly stepped in to end the @entity5 's brutal punishment with less than a minute of the final round remaining			1
fighting for the first time since losing to @entity9 last november , @entity7 delivered the perfect response and is also winning over the @entity12 crowd			1
he dominated from the first bell and it was a miracle that @entity1 remained standing for as long as he did - but only the official will know why he did n't spare him earlier			2
@entity0 fought against @entity1 at @entity17 's @entity16 on saturday night @entity7 looked to exert himself from the off on an impressive evening @entity1 was left battered and bruised after almost 12 rounds of punishment from @entity7 ironically , the fight was almost scrapped an hour before the fighters were due to make their entrance when @entity1 's camp complained about the appointment of @entity12 referee @entity26			1
the issue was resolved at the death when @entity30 's @entity29 stepped in but one imagines mr @entity26 would have been less hesitant			0
a fast start by @entity7 left his opponent , who held the @entity34 interim middleweight world title , with a cut over his right eye by the start of the second round			2
@entity7 switched comfortably from boxing at range to working on the inside but was also guilty of excessive holding			0
the @entity5 had shown in the early stages that he was prepared to fight fire with fire but he was unable to string his punches together in response to @entity7 's bludgeoning blows			2
@entity1 's face was left marked up and he suffered cuts on either side during a torrid fight the @entity53 evades a punch from @entity55 during the @entity34 middleweight bout @entity57 drapes a @entity58 round his son 's shoulders after his impressive victory by the fifth session , @entity7 sensed a stoppage was possible but he would soon learn the visiting man would not go without a tear - up			1
@entity1 was something of a sitting duck by the seventh round as @entity7 picked him off with ease , forcing the doctor to check on the injured eye before the start of the eighth			1
and by the ninth , blood was coming from cuts on either side of his face , yet still he stood defiant			0
only he will know how he survived the next two stanzas but finally , with 49 seconds left on the clock , @entity7 delivered one final , bruising barrage before @entity1 was rescued from his plight			1
' it was a great fight , ' @entity7 said			0
' hats off to @entity1 , i do n't think i 've ever hit someone so many times and he has n't gone down			0
' i 'm surprised the referee did n't stop it [ sooner ]			0
