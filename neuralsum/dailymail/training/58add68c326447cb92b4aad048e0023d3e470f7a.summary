@entity0 gave a lukewarm response to the @entity2 after making his debut for the @entity4 on sunday			1
' my mind was definitely scrambling trying to remember all the rules , ' a smiling @entity0 , a late replacement for the injured @entity6 in the @entity8 team , said			1
with its emphasis on speed , fun and noise , an @entity2 tie comprises five one - set shootouts in men 's and women 's singles , men 's and mixed doubles and a past champions match with the team that wins the most games , not sets , declared the winner			1
@entity0 hits a return shot during his game againstd @entity29 in @entity30 additional features include a 20 - second serve clock , a ' @entity33 ' in which a point is worth double once per set , no advantages , no lets , coaching timeouts and a five - minute shootout if a match is tied at 5 - 5			1
@entity0 won his men 's singles , doubles and mixed doubles against @entity44 at the @entity45 but the 17 - times grand slam champion said he found some of the rules ' strange ' and others unnecessary			1
' the one i think is most unnecessary here is like when you start the motion and let 's say you miss the ball toss , that counts as mistake , ' he said			0
@entity0 ( centre ) , @entity60 and @entity8 @entity4 players pose for a photo on the second day of the tournament ' i think that 's probably most unnecessary			1
' @entity64 said he understood the drive to speed up the game but felt it put a lot of pressure on the players			0
' the way it is right now , i do n't think it will work as a @entity74 event , ' said @entity0 , who agreed to play only the @entity30 leg			2
' maybe there 's something we could take away from this but at the end you know how i am			0
@entity0 ( centre ) , relaxes on the side of the court with @entity85 ( left ) and @entity86 ' i 'm very traditional and i like the way the game is on tour			2
i like the scoring system			0
' @entity0 , however , liked the team format of the league which has also attracted world number ones @entity93 and @entity95 and @entity96			2
' it 's not going to replace how we play the tour but it definitely has a place in our sport to have more interaction , more fun , different rules , ' he said			0
' you bend it , you customise it , it works for everyone involved			0
it 's a very interesting concept			0
