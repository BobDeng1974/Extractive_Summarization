by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 1 december 2012 on trial : the new implant can aid thousands thousands of kidney dialysis patients could receive faster , safer treatment thanks to a new implant being trialled at @entity7 in @entity8 and @entity9			1
about 55,000 patients in the @entity11 suffering with end - stage kidney failure rely on dialysis machines to filter waste and excess water from their blood			1
until now this required regular operations by a specialist surgeon , who has had to join a vein with a nearby major artery to provide sufficient blood flow in the vein for the dialysis machine to operate			1
eventually scar tissue would build up , forcing doctors to place a catheter directly into the major vena cava vein in the heart in a highly risky operation			2
but a new tube , called an @entity32 , may offer a solution			2
firstly , blood flow is temporarily stopped in a specific vein and artery to fit the tube , which is made from silicone			0
the chosen vein is then cut and the narrow end of the tube is inserted inside the vein			0
this end has tiny grips on the outside of it to ensure the tube is fixed tightly			0
a small hole is then punched in the nearby artery , into which the larger end of the tube is inserted			0
this end features two small flanges to prevent the tube becoming dislodged too			0
blood flow is re-established so that the vein can be connected directly to a dialysis machine			1
savior : 55,000 people in @entity11 need dialysis due to failing kidneys the @entity32 tube remains in place permanently , or until a successful kidney transplant takes place			1
@entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 at @entity7 ’s , who was the first surgeon in @entity70 to fit the tube , says : ‘ there has been a huge rise in the demand for dialysis in recent years because of lifestyle - related illnesses such as diabetes			2
‘ this device has the potential to improve and save the lives of so many and , depending on long - term results , should be rolled out nationally by 2013			0
