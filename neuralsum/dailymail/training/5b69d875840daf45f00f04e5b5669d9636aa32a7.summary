a @entity1 widow has made legal history by using her dead husband 's sperm to try to conceive a child – even though it is still against the law			1
the high - flying businesswoman had his sperm extracted without his consent in an ' act of desperation ' while he was in a coma and close to death with a heart condition			2
it is against @entity1 law to take , store , transport and use in @entity21 a man 's sperm without his written consent			1
the businesswoman – who wishes to be referred to as ' ms h ' – has since his death undergone fertility treatment abroad and is now waiting to find out if she is pregnant			1
fertility triumph : @entity30 with her sons @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 ( right ) in 2003			2
@entity30 's husband @entity34 fell into a coma after developing bacterial meningitis in 1995 and later died and doctors extracted his sperm while he was unconscious ruling : the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) instructed @entity1 fertility clinics not to treat mrs blood , however , after a traumatic two - year legal battle , the @entity43 allowed her to seek treatment abroad legal challenge : it is against @entity1 law to take , store , transport and use in @entity21 a man 's sperm without his written consent ms @entity54 , who is in her early 40s , obtained an emergency ruling by a judge to have her husband 's sperm extracted because he was so close to death			1
the judge agreed to the procedure being carried out to allow her time to find proof of his consent			0
despite this never being produced , she was later permitted to take the sperm to another country to begin @entity21 treatment			1
ms @entity54 's case is the first time a @entity1 woman has gone ahead with such treatment without a court hearing			1
the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) did not oppose her bid , meaning the regulatory body effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law			1
@entity80 and @entity81 are among a handful of @entity84 countries where it is legal to use a man 's sperm without his consent in @entity21 treatment			1
the @entity90 's front page after @entity30 won a lengthy legal battle to have her dead husband 's baby in 2002 ms @entity54 travelled with the sperm to one of these countries and was implanted last week			1
her barrister @entity96 said : ' it was an act of desperation , [ but ] that was not her only motive			0
of course she had only had days within which to think things through , but she is a stable , educated woman who sees the reality of her situation – no matter how dire			0
' she was in massive distress , and yet there was also deep love and rationality			0
' both the family of the deceased and that of the businesswoman are supportive of the decision			0
although personal details can not be fully revealed in order to protect ms @entity54 's identity , @entity117 has been told the couple met seven years ago and were married two years later in an @entity120 ceremony in the @entity1 not recognised by @entity1 law			1
they had been planning to undergo @entity21 after initial attempts to become pregnant naturally had failed			2
some 18 months ago , before ms @entity54 and her partner – a financial executive – were able to commence fertility treatment , he fell into a sudden coma due to a previously undiagnosed heart condition			0
doctors advised that he was unlikely to regain consciousness , and that his condition was fatal			0
aware that her partner may not have long to live , ms @entity54 appealed to their medical team to extract his sperm so that it may be stored and used at a later date			0
initially the team refused as she could not provide any evidence of his consent and he was unable to give it			0
such action could be legally classed as assault			0
a clinic storing sperm obtained in this way would also be committing an offence			0
ms @entity54 sought legal counsel and barrister @entity96 successfully obtained an emergency ruling from a judge that allowed for the extraction and storage of the sperm – known as gametes – to take place			2
mr @entity96 explains : ' because of the grave nature of mr @entity54 's condition , the judge agreed that there may not be time to mount a legal case – so allowed the extraction and storage of the gametes			2
' of course there was a chance he could recover and give his consent , but we also sought to find evidence – looking through letters , emails and other documents			0
' no evidence could be found – and mr @entity179 died within days			0
the widow proceeded to pursue further legal action and her legal team later presented a dossier to the @entity39 arguing why she should be allowed to use the sperm in fertility treatment			1
her case follows that of @entity30 , whose husband @entity34 fell into a coma after developing bacterial meningitis in 1995 and later died			2
doctors extracted his sperm while he was unconscious			0
the @entity39 instructed @entity1 fertility clinics not to treat mrs blood			2
however , after a traumatic two - year legal battle , the @entity43 ruled that it was her human right to travel to a different country to have ivf using @entity34 's sperm			1
happy family : @entity30 and sons appear at the @entity204 in 2003 after her late husband @entity34 was finally recognised by law as the father of both children however , it also ruled that this was only because of the unique circumstances of the case and it must not set a precedent			1
mrs @entity30 , from @entity215 , @entity216 , said yesterday : ' at the time of my case i felt the @entity39 was very much against me			1
i 'm glad it has listened and moved forward , which made it easier for this woman and perhaps even easier for other women in the future			0
' she had @entity21 after travelling to @entity227 , which at the time permitted use of sperm extracted in these circumstances to be used in fertility treatment			2
she became pregnant and her son @entity33 was born in the @entity1 in december 1998			0
four years later her second son , @entity234 – again conceived using her late husband 's frozen sperm – arrived			1
mr @entity96 said of ms @entity54 's case : ' my client knew wholeheartedly that she wanted to conceive a child with the man she had built her life with			2
' i was pleased that in this case we were able to work closely with the @entity39 's legal team , who were receptive to our argument and considered my client 's views carefully			1
' however , @entity250 , a solicitor who specialises in ivf and embryo research , said : ' this decision creates uncertainty			0
' the @entity39 is going about things in the wrong way by sidestepping the courts			0
either this is against the law or it is n't – it needs to be clear			0
' the @entity39 did not oppose ms @entity54 's bid to seek @entity21 treatment abroad , meaning the regulatory body effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law an @entity39 spokesman said : ' as the regulator we must act in accordance with the law on the use of gametes			1
in practice , the consent of the person involved has been crucial in determining whether the gametes can be used or not			0
' in the case of @entity30 , the @entity39 sought to uphold the principle of informed consent and , indeed , this was confirmed by the court			1
' the @entity39 has not changed its position since then and the law remains unchanged ; harvesting gametes ( sperm or eggs ) and the storage , and then the use of gametes without the appropriate consent is unlawful and may amount to a criminal offence			1

businesswoman , known as ms h , given permission to use late husband 's sperm in @entity21 treatment abroad
@entity39 effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law
case follows @entity30 who won legal battles to use her late husband 's sperm for ivf
it is against @entity1 law to take , store , transport and use in @entity21 a man 's sperm without his written consent
