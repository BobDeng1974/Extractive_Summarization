by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 11:21 est , 10 march 2014 the sprawling rock stars , their glasses of wine , and the pink flamingo on the mantlepiece are long gone , but there 's no mistaking this iconic @entity10 sitting room			1
two decades after it featured on the cover of @entity14 ' first album , definitely maybe , the room is still instantly recognisable to anyone who came of age in the @entity18 era			2
taken in guitarist @entity21 ’ house in 1994 , the photograph helped the album , which includes the hits supersonic and @entity24 , to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide			1
the sitting room that launched @entity18 : @entity27 lay on the floor while @entity29 strummed his guitar on sofa how it looks today : the sitting room in @entity34 and @entity37 - @entity36 's house is little changed since 1994 spot the difference : despite a few cosmetic changes , the @entity40 ' sitting room is still recognisable and the picture , which shows a young @entity27 lying on the wooden floor while his brother , @entity29 , plays guitar on the sofa , has since become an iconic image for music fans all over the world			1
today the @entity51 townhouse , where @entity14 filmed the music video for their single @entity53 in 1993 , is home to a family with two young children , but the fabric of the room is little changed			1
the wooden floorboards are still uncovered , and while the wooden mantlepiece has since been stripped of its paint , it is the same one the flamingo sat on in 1994 , though the ornate fireplace was taken when @entity21 moved out			2
the picture rails , original cornicing and even the shelves by the window are still there , although the small boxy television ( showing the @entity73 classic , @entity70 ) , has been replaced by a more modern , flatscreen version			0
the walls are no longer pale yellow , having been repainted a more noughties neutral shade , and the beige blinds have been replaced by long brown curtains , but the layout of the room remains the same , with a sofa opposite the fireplace and a seat in the bay window			0
a framed picture of former @entity90 footballer , @entity86 , which stood by the fireplace , is replaced by a flower pot today			0
and there 's no sign of the poster of composer @entity95 , one of @entity29 's idols , which leant against the end of the sofa			0
home : the house in @entity101 , @entity10 , was home to @entity14 guitarist @entity21 and his sisters the floorboards are still bare and the sofa 's still opposite the fireplace , but there are toys in the living room now the convex plastic mirror on the left - hand wall has gone , replaced by a smart rectangular mirror in a wooden frame , and the spot where @entity27 lay on the floor is now covered by a blue rug			1
and the globe light by the fire has gone , as has the pink flamingo , replaced by children 's birthday cards and a watercolour on the wall			0
mother of two @entity126 , 45 , allowed the pictures to be taken of her home in the smart suburb of @entity101 to mark the 20th anniversary of the iconic album , which came out in august 1994			1
a remastered , reissue version of the album called definitely maybe : chasing @entity134 is due out in may			1
but mrs @entity126 said she will not be buying a copy of the reissue of @entity137 because neither she nor her husband , @entity138 , 48 , are fans			2
rear of the house : @entity14 filmed the video for their single , @entity53 , in the garden in 1993 sightseers : mrs @entity126 says she 's used to @entity14 fans peering through the windows but does n't mind them she said : ' my husband @entity138 bought the house in 1999 from @entity21 ’s sisters , then i moved in in 2003			1
' when i first moved in neighbours said " ooh , you ’re moving in to the party house , ’ because they remembered the days when @entity21 used to have the band round for practice sessions and parties			0
' unfortunately my husband and i are n’t @entity14 fans , so we do n’t fully appreciate how special the living room is to others , but we do have had friends and family asking if they can come round to have a photograph taken			2
' the house is included in organised tours for @entity14 fans , and the @entity40 are used to spotting sightseers peering into their sitting room			1
quiet street : the house that used to be known as ' the party house ' is now home to the @entity40 family mrs @entity126 , who works as an education consultant and has children aged four and five months , said : ' to us , it is just our family home but we often get groups of people standing at the gate trying to get a look at the living room			1
' we think it ’s cool really			0
they are always respectful and never come past the gate to have a look			0
' when @entity21 moved out he took the stained glass windows and the fireplace with him - we wish he 'd left them because they are so beautiful			2
' she added : ' once we were in the airport on our way home from @entity199 , and i noticed a picture of the @entity137 album cover			0
it ’s bizarre being able to see our living room pictured all over the world			0
