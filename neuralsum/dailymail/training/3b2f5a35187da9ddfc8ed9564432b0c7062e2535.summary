@entity6 launched the thinly - veiled attack on the @entity9 actress in an interview from the home in @entity12 which she still shares with the @entity14 star			1
it seems to be related to @entity4 and her husband selling pictures of themselves and family – including their 2000 wedding – to glossy magazines			1
sometimes people say things without the slightest proof			0
‘ why would someone who does n’t speak @entity27 or the local @entity12 language or knows nothing about this culture want a house here ? she does n’t even come here much			1
’ and responding to a question about why she was ‘ less visible ’ on the @entity27 resort than the @entity14 actors now , @entity6 , 56 , added : ‘ that ’s because i don ’ t believe in showing off			1
‘ i ’ve never sold photos or kept money from anything and i ’ve always given everything away to charity			2
‘ i ’m proud to be able to say that i ’ve never turned my private life into showbusiness			0
‘ too much public exposure affects children			0

the two mrs @entity54 : @entity56 ( left ) and the current wife @entity4 ( right ) both the @entity59 star , and @entity6 have spoken out in support of @entity53 who was sentenced to nine - and - a - half - years in prison in 2010 for selling methamphetamine and heroin possession			1
a @entity66 judge nearly doubled his sentence after he was found guilty of repeatedly breaking prison rules by arranging to get drugs			0
he was placed in solitary confinement for several months after failing a prison drugs test - and is not scheduled for release until 2018			0
@entity6 said she can now visit him every other weekend following his release from solitary but told respected @entity27 newspaper @entity75 : ‘ putting a drug addict in a jail is like putting a diabetic in a cake shop without treatment			1
‘ it ’s horrible that someone with money and famous parents should receive such tough punishment			2

but last year , he admitted that they should have split much sooner			0
‘ i know i ’m going to get into trouble here , ’ he said			0
‘ i have nothing against her and in fact i ’m very fond of my first wife			0
but we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier			0
‘ it took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counsellor to resolve problems , it ’s in his interest to keep the marriage going			2
‘ because if i end the marriage he ’s got no business			2
i think @entity6 would probably say the same thing			1
that ’s the only clear regret that i have			2
