by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:47 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 01:07 est , 10 october 2012 on a push to expose his softer side , @entity4 presidential nominee @entity3 on tuesday revealed his intimate connection to the attack last month in eastern @entity9 that left four @entity10 dead			1
almost a month after the deadly attack on the @entity10 embassy , @entity3 announced that he personally knew @entity13 , one of the two @entity14 who was killed by attackers			1
republicans , including @entity3 , have cited the attack to criticize president @entity19 's foreign policy			1
the attack also was the centerpiece of @entity3 's high - profile , foreign policy speech monday at the @entity24			1
personal connection : @entity26 ( left ) was one of the @entity14 killed in the september 11 @entity9 embassy attack , and @entity3 revealed today that he met the former seal in either 2009 or 2010 close ties ? @entity3 waited a day to share his ties to the events in @entity9 , telling his story at a rally in @entity34 on tuesday , one of a handful of battleground states @entity3 , pictured at a campaign event in @entity39 , @entity34 , on tuesday , talked about a chance encounter with the fallen @entity41 at a @entity43 party but @entity3 waited a day to share his ties to the events in @entity9 , telling his story at a rally in @entity34 , one of a handful of battleground states where he has been getting personal to help persuade undecided voters to support him			1
the story begins with a chance encounter at a @entity43 party in southern @entity52 in 2009 or 2010			0
he could n't be sure which			0
on a blustery day on an @entity34 cornfield , @entity3 explained that he had gotten a flier at his home in southern @entity52 for a neighborhood @entity43			2
he had n't planned on going but , after noticing a party getting started at a house almost across the street , he and his wife changed their minds and decided to pop over			0
killed in action : @entity13 was 42 years old when he died after the coordinated attack on the @entity10 consulate in @entity9 it was n't until after dinner that they realized they were at the wrong house			1
' turns out , this was n't the neighborhood party			0
this was a family having a party with their friends , ' @entity3 said as his audience laughed			2
' we were a little embarrassed but they treated us well nonetheless and i got to meet some really interesting people			0
' then the story turns serious , as has become the custom in @entity3 's campaign speeches in recent days			2
at rallies in @entity86 , @entity87 and now @entity34 , he has swapped the tales of hard - working entrepreneurs that had filled his speeches for months in favor of anecdotes about people in his life who have died			0
he talks about a 14 - year - old leukemia patient , a quadriplegic classmate and an @entity10 soldier killed last year in @entity98			1
then there is @entity13 , the former @entity100 met at a party he was n't supposed to attend			0
and @entity13 , who was 42 at the time of his death , talked about his work in the @entity109 for a private security company after he finished his tour of duty as a @entity14			0
' you can imagine how i felt when i found out that he was one of the two former @entity14 killed in @entity114 on september 11 , ' @entity3 said in @entity34 , pausing to stay composed			1
' it touched me obviously as i recognized this young man that i thought was so impressive had lost his life in his service of his fellow men and women			0
' misstep : the attack in @entity114 initially created a political headache for @entity3 , whose campaign issued a statement condemning the @entity10 response before the severity of the violence was known also killed were @entity10 ambassador @entity129 , diplomat @entity130 , @entity13 and @entity131 , another former @entity14			1
the attack in @entity114 initially created a political headache for @entity3 , whose campaign issued a statement condemning the @entity10 response before the severity of the violence was known			1
@entity3 was widely criticized by both democrats and @entity4 for trying to gain politically from the loss of four @entity10 lives			1
softening image : @entity3 told an audience in @entity34 about the story of his run - in at a @entity43 party in @entity52 now , considering his personal connection to one of the victims , it is even more surprising that though he was quick to rebuke @entity19 but so slow to show that he had a vested interest in the actions at the embassy			1
in recent weeks , @entity19 's critics have questioned the administration 's handling of the situation			1
officials initially blamed what happened on a spontaneous protest they said was sparked by reaction to an @entity160 video that ridiculed the @entity161 and ignited mob protests at @entity10 diplomatic posts across the @entity109 and in @entity164			2
the administration later said what happened in @entity114 was a terrorist attack carried out by @entity169 - linked militants			2
in the foreign policy speech monday , @entity3 returned again and again to @entity114			2
' i want to be very clear : the blame for the murder of our people in @entity9 , and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries , lies solely with those who carried them out - no one else , ' he said			1
critical timing : initially after the attacks , @entity3 criticized @entity19 's reaction to the deaths but refrained from telling the personal story until tuesday ' but it is the responsibility of our president to use @entity10 's great power to shape history - not to lead from behind , leaving our destiny at the mercy of events , ' he said			1
â€˜ unfortunately , that is exactly where we find ourselves in the @entity109 under president @entity19			2
' his tone tuesday in @entity34 was very different			0
@entity3 said he learned that @entity13 was in another building across town when he and his colleagues found out the consulate was under attack			1
they did n't hunker down where they were in safety			0
they rushed there to go help , ' @entity3 said			2
' this is the @entity10 way			0
we go where there 's trouble			0
we go where we 're needed			0
and right now we are needed			0
right now the @entity10 people need us			0

@entity3 met former @entity220 years before he was killed in the attack on the @entity10 embassy in @entity9
@entity4 was critical of @entity19 administration response to attacks , but waited till tuesday to tell of his connection to the slain seal
