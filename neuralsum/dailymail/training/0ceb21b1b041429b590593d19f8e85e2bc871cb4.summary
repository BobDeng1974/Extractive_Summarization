by @entity0 published : 15:38 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 28 march 2013 these are the @entity2 migrant families who are forced to live in old shipping containers due to a lack of housing			1
for just £ 50 a month , they rent out their metal homes on the outskirts of @entity8			1
millions of rural migrants have flocked to @entity2 's fast developing cities in recent decades , but many are unable to join the property ladder as house prices have boomed and rents have soared			1
left behind : the containers , which house different families , were set up by the landlord , who charges a rent of 500 yuan ( £ 50 ) per month risk : a similar container village in @entity21 was pulled down by the @entity2 authorities in 2011 because it was too ' dangerous ' struggling : there are 18 shipping container homes in this ' village ' on the edge of @entity8 they also struggle for rights to health care and public education because of the government 's household - registration system ' hukou '			1
@entity33 , a native of @entity34 , said she and three other migrant families have lived in the so - called ' container village ' for the last 10 years			2
the old cargo containers were reportedly rescued by a man in his 70s , known simply as the ' old man ' , who acts as landlord after he found them discarded on the side of a road			2
all are equipped with doors , windows , electricity and water and @entity33 said she feels safe			2
she has divided her 15 square metre home into a small supermarket , selling food , drinks and other daily necessities , and a living room with a bed , sofa and even a television			0
safe : all the containers are equipped with water , electricity , doors and windows overcrowded : @entity8 has a population of around 23million but many migrants ca n't afford housing established : the shipping containers are believed to have housed workers for more than 10 years @entity33 told @entity70 : ' it was more than 10 years ago that the ' old man ' bought the containers from local customs			1
he planned to use them as warehouses on the land he rented from the government but later decided to lease them out to migrant workers			0
another female resident living in the container said the ' old man ' took pity on some migrant workers who survived by collecting garbage and charged them very low rent			0
' many people ask me how i feel living in a container			0
i say it 's quite fine as i 've never lived in an apartment in the city , ' said @entity33			0
' the iron containers are quite solid and i do not have to worry about leakages during rain or the roof collapsing			2
' a similar container village existed in suburban @entity100 in @entity21 in 2011			0
but last may , @entity102 government officials claimed the container village ' posed danger to residents			0
' rescued : the old cargo containers were reportedly taken from the side of the road by a man in his 70s who acts as landlord to the workers abandoned : many @entity2 families struggle to find affordable accommodation and are forced to put up with living conditions many would view as intolerable			1

four families *pay* around £ 50 a month to live in old cargo containers
