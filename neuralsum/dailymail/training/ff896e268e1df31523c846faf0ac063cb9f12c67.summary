@entity1 lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle want state delegate @entity4 to resign but he may commute to work soon from jail as part of a work - release program			1
@entity4 began serving a six - month jail sentence on friday after accepting a plea deal in a criminal case that could have sent him to prison for 41 years			1
prosecutors said he engaged in a sexual relationship with a 17 - year - old female office assistant , who is now pregnant , and sent a naked photo of her to a friend			1
part of the evidence against him , which he read to reporters on the courthouse steps in july , was a text allegedly from his young paramour to a third - party , reading : ' @entity28 , i just f * * * ed my boss			1
' he claimed the photo and the text messages were planted by a 24 - year - old female named @entity34 who grew jealous after the now - 18 - year - old college freshman rejected her lesbian advances			1
the 57 - year - old has seen his law license suspended and revoked , has paid a $ 500,000 judgment to a man he brutally beat in 1999 , lost a job teaching law in @entity60 for hiding his disbarment , and earned his nickname – ' @entity63 ' – for engaging in a courtroom fistfight while he was a prosecutor in 1991			1
and the noted gun - control advocate brandished an @entity67 rifle during a 2013 debate in the @entity70 , @entity1 statehouse			0
that brought back memories of a 1994 incident when police recovered an uzi submachine gun in from a heroin dealer – a gun that police had loaned @entity4 , then a prosecutor , for use as a prop when he spoke at schools about drugs and violence			1
all that was before he police found him and a teenage girl at his townhouse			0
special prosecutor @entity89 told the @entity90 at the time that @entity4 ' had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it			1
' @entity4 , who has three daughters including a toddler with three different women , faced grand jury indictments on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor , possession of pornographic images of an underage female , and solicitation to obtain the images			2
the young woman , now 18 and pregnant , has been identified publicly by @entity4 only as ' @entity110			2
' she had been on the job as an assistant in @entity4 's office for less than two weeks , court records show , when he began taking her with him to official events			1
both @entity4 and the younger girl denied engaging in sex , and her mother and grandmother both backed her up			2
at the time he was charged with the felonies , @entity4 vowed that there was ' not a snowball ’s chance in hell ' that he would resign his @entity128 seat			2
that has n't changed , even though he sits in a county jail			0
@entity4 entered what 's known as an @entity133 plea on friday , acknowledging that the government had sufficient evidence to convict him of a single misdemeanor charge			2
he did not admit any specific wrongdoing			0
his 6 - month sentence will likely be over in just 90 days if he maintains good behavior behind bars			0
and a judge has approved a work - release arrangement that would allow him to leave the jail with an ankle - monitor in order to perform his official duties for 10 hours each day			0
some of @entity4 's colleagues are howling			1
@entity149 delegate @entity148 tweeted on friday that ' @entity4 should immediately resign his seat in the @entity128 and disappear			0
forever ! ' @entity151 in the state legislature are more guarded , with one telling the @entity90 that they might pressure him to quit			0
@entity151 governor @entity153 , however , wants no part of him			0
on saturday he called for @entity4 's ' immediate resignation			1
' on sunday the embattled lawmaker said he 's asked his lawyer to examine the @entity158 to see what his options are			0
he 's also planning to sue his accusers , including special prosecutor @entity89 , who persuaded a @entity162 to indict him in 2013			0
@entity89 unsuccessfully opposed the reinstatement of @entity4 's law license in 2011 , claiming he ' completely lacks any moral compass ' and engaged in ' notoriously unethical practices			1
' that opinion came with a litany of evidence			0
he landed two fists on the face of a flamboyant defense attorney during the 1991 courtroom brawl , landing in jail			2
in 1993 the @entity176 yanked his license to practice law after he was indicted on a bribery charge			0
that case concerned his decision to dismiss a rape charge against a defendant whose father allegedly paid his victim $ 25,000 to get himself off the hook , and another $ 25,000 to a list of charities @entity4 chose			1
charges against @entity4 in that case were later dismissed			0
not shooting straight : @entity4 brandished an @entity67 during a floor debate about gun rights , but had earlier admitted losing track of an @entity195 that law enforcement officers had loaned him for use as a prop during speeches five years later , his license was suspended a second time after a 90 - day stint in jail for contempt of court , for tainting a drug prosecution by leaking information to reporters			1
a judge in that proceeding banned him from arguing cases in court for two years			0
in 1999 @entity4 was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after physically assaulting a home contractor			2
according to a legal brief filed by the home contractor 's attorneys , @entity4 shouted , ' i 'm going to kill you			2
i 'm going to beat your head in , ' before beating the victim and ' smash ( ing ) his head into the corner of a brick wall			0
' in 2002 the victim won a judgment against him in civil court , which he paid off with a $ 500,000 check in 2007 , @entity225 reported			1
but @entity4 was n't as diligent with his community - service sentence : a court found he tried submitted phony documentation showing how many hours he had worked off , and sent him to jail for another 90 days			2
the bar association ' disbarred ' him for that offense , tearing up his law license permanently – but relented a decade later and reinstated him in 2012			0
but meanwhile , @entity4 made headlines for losing his job teaching law in @entity60 when authorities there learned of his disbarment in the @entity244			1

@entity4 's decades - long legal career includes a disbarment that he hid from *clients* – and from an @entity60 *university* where he taught
last year he was arrested for allegedly *sleeping* with a 17 - year - old office assistant and sending a naked picture of the now - pregnant girl to a friend
both denied a sexual relationship despite *mounting* evidence of time they spent together ; he claimed a *hacker* planted photos and texts on his phone
one text , allegedly from the young girl , read : ' @entity28 , i just f * * * ed my boss . '
' @entity270 got his nickname from a 1991 courtroom fistfight during his years as a prosecutor
in 2007 @entity4 paid a man $ 500,000 to *settle* a court judgment against him for a separate 1999 physical assault
