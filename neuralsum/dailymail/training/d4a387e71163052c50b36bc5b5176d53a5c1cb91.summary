@entity1 globetrotters will now be able to get their much - loved flat whites while travelling across the @entity3 , with @entity4 finally adding the beverage to its menu			1
while most bemoan the coffee - making abilities of @entity3 , the @entity7 put the coffee giant 's version of the beloved hipster drink to the ultimate test by calling on radio announcer @entity13 to try out the new addition			1
@entity13 is best known for his role as the prickly judge of hey hey it 's saturday 's @entity18 and lead guitarist of rock bank @entity20			1
@entity13 - whose drink of choice is the flat white - told the national broadcaster he often had to coax @entity3 baristas through the process of making a good cup of joe			1
' in order to get a decent coffee here you have to get a cup and you say " i 'd like an espresso , and then can you put another espresso in that cup , and then can you pour some milk on top - no that 's enough " , ' he said			0
a @entity4 ' flat white is made with ' steamed whole milk poured over two shots of espresso , topped with microfoam swirled into beautiful latte art ' , according to its website			1
@entity13 is best known for his role as the prickly judge of @entity62 's @entity18 and lead guitarist of rock bank @entity20 and it seems the cafe chain is on to something good but still has room for improvement			0
in the initial first sips , @entity13 said the coffee was a bit weak for his liking but he was ' happy with the foam '			1
he also questioned the lack of promised ' latte art '			0
' the important thing is , maybe it 's not how coffee should be , but they 're having a go , ' he said			0
for years , there has been much debate surrounding the origins of the flat white			2
it has been reported the beverage first appeared in the early 1980s in @entity85 but @entity86 have laid claim to creating the concoction , saying they were drinking them as early as the 1970s			0
but over the ditch in @entity94 , @entity92 coffee makers credit themselves with the invention of the flat white we know today in the later 1980s , the @entity90 reported			1
@entity4 has started serving the flat white , which some say originated in @entity1 , in stores while social media has been abuzz with the new drink options , @entity1 were less than enamored by the inclusion @entity105 's @entity104 wrote : ' if starbucks u.s flat white attempt is similar to their " cappuccino " attempt , ill stick to black coffee while i am there ' while social media has been abuzz with the new drink options , @entity1 were less than enamored by the inclusion			1
' so @entity3 is in a flap about the flat white			2
the really big deal is that @entity4 has found a new style of coffee to f * * k up , ' @entity119 's @entity118 tweeted			0
while @entity105 's @entity104 wrote : ' if starbucks u.s flat white attempt is similar to their " cappuccino " attempt , ill stick to black coffee while i am there '			2
and for @entity3 , @entity4 ' flat white is more of an acquired taste			2
' the @entity133 is just a glass of warm milk , ' @entity132 said			0
@entity136 echoed his sentiments : ' the @entity133 is just a glass of warm milk			0
