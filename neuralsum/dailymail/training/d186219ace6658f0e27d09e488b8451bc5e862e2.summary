by @entity0 published : 00:48 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 02:15 est , 20 november 2013 nearly thirty years of @entity2 ’s street art history was wiped out overnight monday when a warehouse that was once the city ’s graffiti @entity4 was completely painted over			1
known as @entity7 and referred to lovingly as the @entity10 of @entity11 , the @entity9 warehouse was the most impressive and beloved of the few remaining spots in the city where aerosol - wielding artists could legally do their work			1
the covert move came after a struggle between graffiti lovers and the building ’s owner @entity20 , whose plan to raze the landmark to build luxury condos was approved in october			1
but @entity20 ’s decision to paint over the painstaking work of some 1,500 artists at night and without attempting to preserve anything at all leaves @entity30 supporters angry and puzzled			1
then and now : a building that was known around the world as the @entity4 of @entity2 was quietly painted over monday night by the building 's owner who plans to build condos the final blow against the internationally known , unmistakable building visible right off @entity37 ’ elevated 7 line train came earlier this month when a judge denied an effort by graffiti artists to stop the planned demolition			1
the building ’s fate had been all but sealed since october when @entity20 , who has owned the warehouse since 1971 — and actually gave the first okay that led to the creation of 5 @entity7 — had his plans to knock it down in favor of profitable condos in the burgeoning @entity9 enclave approved			1
‘ this is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffiti , ’ a tearful @entity53 , a spokeswoman for the group behind @entity30 told the @entity55			0
‘ he ’s painted over the work of at least 1,500 artists			2
’ erased history : seen easily from the city 's busy 7 line train , the so - called @entity10 of @entity11 had hosted the works of artists from around the world over nearly 30 years and had become a landmark of sorts in the borough of @entity9 humane : @entity20 , who owns the @entity9 building says he painted over the graffiti covertly and instead of just tearing down the building because it was the ' humane ' thing and would limit confrontations with graffiti lovers ' i cried this morning ' : @entity20 , who actually gave the first okay that allowed the building to become graffiti @entity30 , says he loved the place but not enough to preserve it @entity53 was one of many who fought to preserve @entity7 after @entity20 ’s plans were revealed			1
‘ it ’s like @entity89 , ’ the spokeswoman said in june			0
‘ what the landlord does n’t understand is that @entity7 is a brand and an icon , and if he knocks it down it will be missed			0
’ now , that grieving process has begun			0
supporters of the iconic spot gathered tuesday and made plans for a candlelight vigil			0
endangered species : @entity30 was one of the last , the largest , and most iconic place in @entity2 where graffiti artists can legally practice their art @entity20 purchased the complex , made up of mostly abandoned buildings at the time , that makes up @entity7 in 1971			1
he leased space to a company that first produced record player accessories , then eight tracks , then @entity112 cases before moving out in the early 90s , reports the @entity55			0
@entity20 then filled the void by renting studio space out to artists for a few hundred dollars per month			1
he says a man at the time asked him if graffiti artists he knew could use the warehouse as a canvas			1
he agreed and the open air art space began to flourish as @entity20 allowed them to use more of the warehouse 's exterior			2
in 2002 , the by then iconic walls of @entity20 's building became an official art space as a graffiti artist named @entity129 took over the operation as curator and named it @entity7			1
in the years since its humble inception , @entity7 had become a international destination			2
it had become a graffiti museum of sorts attracted tourists from around the world eager to see the unique spectacle			0
@entity129 brought in a rotating lineup of artists from areas as far as @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 to add their vision to @entity30 's history			0
a particularly striking likeness of murdered rapper @entity149 , an unmissable sight from the elevated 7 train , was actually painted by a @entity153 artist			0
graffiti has piled atop graffiti at @entity30 and no one disputes the ephemeral nature of the art form			0
but @entity20 's take on the perpetual battle of the old versus the new spells the true end of @entity7			2
@entity20 's plan to put 2 million square feet of luxury condos was okayed by city planners in october and attempts to halt @entity30 's demolition were struck down in court earlier this month			2
' it ’s time for me to put something else there , ' @entity20 told the @entity55 , before launching into a pitch for @entity173 - adjacent development before its even begun			2
' i can get you to 53rd and @entity175 in 12 minutes ! ' one such supporter , who gave his name as @entity178 , just stared at the newly white walls for hours			0
this is not just about graffiti — it ’s about the unity of people who met here from all over the world			0
that ’s what really hurts			0
’ @entity20 told the @entity55 that painting over the graffiti on the 200,000 square foot warehouse was the ‘ humane ’ thing to do , but admits he also did so at night to avoid confrontation			1
‘ i am telling you , i did not like what they did — i loved what they did , ’ said @entity20			2
‘ i cried this morning , i swear to you			0
’ progress ? the area will soon become home to a proposed 2 million square foot development destination : a roster of thousands of the world 's most dedicated street artists would visit @entity30 each year to place their work , legally , among the best in the game @entity20 ’s approved proposal laid out plans to erect two million square feet of development in a trendy area where luxury one bedroom apartments easily stretch toward $ 4,000 per month			1
@entity20 says his love of the artists for whom he ‘ had nothing but admiration ’ prompted the overnight whitewashing			2
‘ the last thing i want is for any of them to get arrested , ’ he said			0
over the years , @entity7 had become an international destination for street artists in addition to its home grown fans			1
controlled chaos : more than a spot for graffiti , @entity7 actually had a curator and a rotating roster of visiting artists outgunned : graffiti artists only just this month lost a legal fight to preserve @entity7 as an historic landmark @entity20 , who has owned the building since 1971 , was granted permission to move forward with his 2 million square foot development in trendy @entity9 , @entity9 back in october while the battle to save the building was still being waged , @entity238 graffiti icon @entity237 showed his support in a final message to @entity2 at the tail end of his recent high profile stay in the city			1
‘ @entity246 , ’ he wrote			0
unfortunately for graffiti lovers , that message went unheeded by those who wield the wrecking balls			0
the end of the @entity30 era will take an agonizing three or four months as the building that once hosted a thousand artists a year is slowly demolished			2
@entity20 says there will be a 60 - foot wall near the proposed towers in where graffiti artists may continue to paint			1
mourning : graffiti lovers gathered tuesday to mourn the loss of their @entity2 @entity4 and to plan a vigil some people left handwritten notes atop the whitewash paint on tuesday			0
this is not just about graffiti ¿ it ¿ s about the unity of people who met here from all over the world			0
that ¿ s what really hurts @entity271 said one mourner consolation prize : over the next several months , 5 @entity276 will be torn down and luxury condo towers will be put in its place			1
the owner says a 60 foot wall will be put in place on which street artists may continue to paint end of an era : a street artist known as @entity287 works on a memorial mural on tuesday			1

5 @entity276 , a warehouse in @entity9 , @entity9 known as the @entity10 of @entity11 for its international renown is now a plain white building
street artists had recently lost a legal fight to preserve the spot where thousands had left their marks legally over nearly 30 years
building owner @entity20 says he loved the graffiti and though he *'ll* be tearing down the building , he painted over it first as the ' humane ' thing to do
