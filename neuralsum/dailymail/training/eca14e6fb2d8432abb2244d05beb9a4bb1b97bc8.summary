by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:47 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 08:32 est , 1 august 2013 a year ago , the world 's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , identifying what is believed to be the @entity9 -- the long - sought maker of mass. today , its computer screens are dark , the control desks unstaffed and the giant , supercooled tunnel empty of the crashing proton beams whose snapshots of the @entity17 helped flush out the elusive particle			1
but the silence is an illusion			0
behind the scenes , work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade , enabling it to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther			2
a worker stands below the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , a general - purpose detector at @entity35 's @entity34 , during maintenance works			1
deep below the border between @entity40 and @entity41 , the tunnel stretches out of sight , decked with silver installations fit for a starship the 27km circular lab , straddling the @entity41 - @entity40 border 100metres underground , went offline in february for an 18 - month overhaul			1
and when experiments resume in 2015 , scientists at the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter , dark energy and super symmetry -- ideas considered as wild as the @entity9 was , half a century ago			1
as engineers focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) has churned out since 2010 , for there could be more nuggets to find			1

a year ago , the world 's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , identifying what is believed to be the @entity9 -- the long - sought maker of mass ' the things that are easy to spot have already been exploited , and now we 're taking another look , ' said @entity78 of @entity35 , noting wryly that dealing with the unknown was , well , unknowable			1
' we always say that astronomers have an easier task , because they can actually see what they 're looking for ! ' the @entity34 's particle collisions transform energy into mass , the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe			1

the 27 kilometre circular lab went offline in february for an 18 - month overhaul			1
when experiments resume in 2015 , scientists at @entity35 will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter , dark energy and supersymmetry at peak capacity , the ' old ' @entity34 managed a mind - boggling 550 million collisions per second			1
' we give the guys as many collisions as we can , ' said @entity106 , head of its operating team			0
' that 's our bread and butter			0
most of that stuff is not very interesting , so there are real challenges sorting out and throwing most of that away , and picking out the interesting stuff , ' he explained in the tunnel , which mixes installations fit for a starship with the low - tech practicality of bicycles for inspection tours			0
@entity35 's supercomputers are programmed to identify within microseconds the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter			2
the @entity34 's computer screens are dark , but behind the scenes , work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade , enabling the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther ' we want to understand how that behaves , why it sticks itself together into tiny things that we call atoms and nuclei at really small scales , into things that we call people and chairs and buildings at bigger scales , and then planets and solar systems , galaxies at larger scales , ' said @entity35 spokesman @entity158			1
@entity35 's work can bemuse beginners , but the researchers find ways to make it simple			0
' everybody knows what an electron is , especially if they put their finger in an electric socket , ' joked @entity170 , whose team has just provided the most exhaustive confirmation to date of the @entity173 , the chief theoretical framework of particle physics conceived in the 1970s			0
at peak capacity , the ' old ' @entity34 managed a mind - boggling 550 million collisions per second			1
' we give the guys as many collisions as we can , ' said @entity106 , head of its operating team			0
here , an engineer observes the @entity32 they achieved the most accurate measurement yet of a change in a particle called a @entity189 , showing that out of every billion , only a handful decay into smaller particles called muon , and do so in pairs			0
for the experts , that finding was almost as thrilling as tracking the @entity9 -- nicknamed the @entity9			2
it was theorised in 1964 by @entity198 physicist @entity197 and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others , such as light , have none			0
as engineers ( pictured ) focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the @entity34 has churned out since 2010 , for there could be more nuggets to find it is believed to act like a fork dipped in syrup and held up in dusty air			1
while some dust slips through cleanly , most gets sticky - in other words , acquires mass. with mass comes gravity , which pulls particles together			0
the @entity173 is a trusty conceptual vehicle but it still lacks an explanation for gravity , nor does it account for dark matter and dark energy , which comprise most of the cosmos and whose existence is inferred from their impact on ordinary matter			0
some physicists champion supersymmetry , the notion that there are novel particles which mirror each known particle			2

when it is back in business , the supercomputers are programmed to identify the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter ' we have a theory that describes all the stuff around us , all the ordinary , visible matter that makes up the @entity260			0
except , the problem is , it does n't			0
it makes up around five percent of the @entity260 , ' said @entity158			0
the @entity34 replaced the @entity264 ( @entity264 ) , which ran from 1989 to 2000			2
@entity265 it came online in 2008 , but ran into problems , forcing a year - long refit			0
the @entity34 's particle collisions transform energy into mass , the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe			1
here a scientist gestures in front of a diagram of one of the many goings on at the @entity34 it went on to reach a collision level of eight teraelectron volts ( @entity285 ) -- an energy measure -- compared to the @entity264 's @entity285			2
after the 50 million @entity40 franc ( $ 54 - million , million - euro ) upgrade , the target is 14 tev , meaning bigger bangs and clearer snapshots			0
" ' every time we pass a significant amount of data collected , someone will find an excuse to open a bottle of champagne , " said physicist @entity292 , glancing at a lab corner piled with empties			2
" we 're going to run out of space eventually ! ' the particle was theorised in 1964 by @entity198 physicist @entity197 and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others , such as light , have none			0
the search more knowledge about the @entity9 will resume when the @entity34 opens again after its upgrade			1

the 27 km circular lab went offline in february but will *reopen* in 2015 with more *firepower* to help scientists solve the *mysteries* of the universe
a year ago , the @entity34 made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , identifying what is believed to be the @entity9
as engineers focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through data that the mighty atom smasher has churned out since 2010
