' we are thrilled to enhance our relationship with the launch of @entity4 movies on demand , and even more excited about bringing our members so much new content in the process			1
' @entity2 announced the deal with @entity4 as rivals @entity52 revealed that it had signed its own contract that will see its service offer new shows from @entity56 from 2014			1
though financial details were not disclosed , @entity52 said the agreement includes more than 300 hours of new tv episodes in a multi-year deal			2
analysts estimated the contract could be worth several hundred million dollars over time			0
the transaction is a major coup for both the video streaming company and the movie studio that produces the new content			0
it helps @entity52 compete with pay tv channels such as @entity70 and @entity71 , and it gives @entity56 a potentially lucrative outlet for its shows as it tries to shed its reliance on two or three big - budget movies each year			1
new to @entity52 : @entity56 ' @entity76 ( pictured ) will be exclusively viewable on @entity52 ' this is arguably a groundbreaking deal , ' said @entity78 , a @entity79 's equity analyst who covers both @entity52 and @entity56 while concerns remain about how much the deal will cost @entity52 in the end , the company said it can debut the original series in the 40 countries where @entity52 operates			1
that could help spread the costs over more territories and more subscribers if @entity52 continues to grow overseas			2
' the big question is if this is going to be an international catalyst in terms of subscriber growth , ' @entity78 said			0
investors hailed the deal as a win - win			0
@entity52 shares rose $ 15.24 , or 7.1 per cent , to close at $ 229.23 on monday , while @entity56 shares rose 93 cents , or 4 per cent , to close at $ 23.74			1
mutually beneficial : the deal gives @entity56 a potentially lucrative outlet for its shows as it tries to shed its reliance on two or three big - budget movies each year @entity52 is doubling down on original children 's programming , hoping to strengthen its push to become a family entertainment brand			1
the new content should ease some of the pain of losing a range of kids shows from @entity114 's @entity113 network , including future episodes of ' @entity116 , ' which @entity18 snapped up for its streaming service in early june			0
the deal suggests @entity56 will significantly ramp up its production of tv shows			2
currently , it only produces ' @entity121 : riders of @entity123 ' for @entity124 , which completed a run of 20 episodes at 23 minutes each - less than 8 hours of content in all - in march			0
hit : the success of ' @entity132 , ' the political drama starring @entity129 that debuted to rave reviews on @entity52 in february , paved the way for the company to buy more original content a second season of ' @entity121 ' is set for release in the fall , and @entity52 had already contracted with @entity56 for a series based on its upcoming film , ' @entity141			1
' but the deal suggests that several new series will have to debut each year to fulfill the industry standard deal length of five to seven years			0
new series will be based on characters either from future film hits , past franchises like ' @entity149 , ' or even older hits , including the hundreds of characters like ' @entity152 , ' which @entity56 acquired when it bought @entity153 last july for $ 155 million			2
miss : after ' @entity156 ' debuted last month , @entity52 's shares dropped more than 6 per cent because critics had mixed reviews the multi-year agreement tops the undisclosed amount @entity52 spent on ' @entity132 , ' the political drama starring @entity129 that debuted to rave reviews on @entity52 in february			2
@entity52 has been adding original programming to its roster of older movies and tv show reruns , and is set to launch the @entity167 - created ' @entity168 ' next month			1
the company has said that for the next several years , it will contain original content spending to within 10 per cent of its $ 2billion in annual content costs			0
@entity52 's increased focus on children 's programming is seen as a departure from the tactics of traditional premium pay tv channels such as @entity70 , @entity178 and @entity71 , whose original shows tend to be tailored to adults			2
it also ramps up the competition for children viewers with @entity18 , which said last month it will produce three new original kids shows for members of its @entity187 subscription plan			0
@entity52 has said it has 29.2 million streaming video subscribers in the @entity189 and 7.1 million internationally as of the end of march			2
those figures are up 5.8 million and 4.1 million respectively from a year ago			0
in december , @entity52 announced it will offer @entity4 movies , starting with films released in 2016			1
it declined to make a similar deal for the rights to @entity197 movies starting in 2016 , which was kept by @entity178			0
new to @entity52 : @entity56 ' @entity76 ( pictured ) will be exclusively viewable on @entity52 @entity52 has gradually been shifting where it spends money - preferring exclusive and original content over shows that appear elsewhere , as was the case with content from @entity178 and @entity114			1
it let both of those deals lapse			0
the company studies the viewing habits of its subscribers to gather insights into whether the programming is likely to be a hit on its service , and how much to pay for it			0
but not all of its picks have been winners			0
after ' @entity156 ' debuted last month , @entity52 's shares dropped more than 6 per cent because critics had mixed reviews			2
monday 's gains more than made up the lost ground .			0

@entity2 to show ' growing list ' of classic and modern @entity4 titles
@entity52 will show exclusive @entity56 content from next year
