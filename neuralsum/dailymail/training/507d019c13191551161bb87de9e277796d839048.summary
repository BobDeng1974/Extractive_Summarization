by @entity0 published : 17:44 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 19:21 est , 29 may 2013 her provocative pose , thigh - high stockings and black bondage - style bra look fit for the heroine of @entity7			1
in fact , the only thing missing is a riding crop			0
in other photographs , the heavily made - up twentysomething model wears lacy hold - ups , cut - out knickers and a plunging bodysuit which leaves little to the imagination			1
but this is n’t a campaign for @entity19 or even @entity20			0
instead , they ’re the newly - released images from @entity22 ’s revamped @entity25 / @entity24 lingerie line , masterminded by its latest style director @entity26			1
@entity27 marks : @entity22 's lingerie collection is decidedly risque her new clothing collection for the struggling retailer was rapturously received when it was unveiled this month , with commentators praising the flattering cuts and grown - up detail			1
however , @entity26 ’s lingerie line is ‘ adult ’ in a rather different way			1
judging by the pouting model and the very saucy styling , the nation ’s favourite bra and pants outlet has shot itself in its suddenly slinky , stocking - clad foot			2
for who on earth thought that putting the s&m into good old @entity22 was a sensible idea ? could it be that falling profits and dire clothing sales have got someone ’s knickers in a twist ? after all , the average shopper at @entity22 is a size 14 - 16 , 49 - year - old mother who probably does n’t want to go out feeling as trussed - up as an oven - ready chicken			1
' judging by the pouting model and the very saucy styling , the nation ’s favourite bra and pants outlet has shot itself in its suddenly slinky , stocking - clad foot ' in these straitened times , it also seems unlikely she ’ll be willing to pay £ 19.50 for a pair of knickers and £ 35 for a slip from this collection			2
most women i know go into @entity22 for comfy underwear that will wash well , does n’t break the bank and wo n’t dig into the skin , bag , sag or show under clothing and will look subtly sexy in front of their husbands			1
they ’re just not in the market for becoming @entity84			0
just because almost every woman in the country has read @entity7 does n’t mean we want to act it out			0
and to assume so is , frankly , insulting			0
now do n’t get me wrong			0
i may be 60 , but i ’m no prude when it comes to underwear - or anything else			1
this week , i ’ve been devouring a very raunchy contemporary retelling of @entity93 - i take you , by @entity95 - in preparation for a @entity98 debate about women and erotica at which i ’m speaking			2
in @entity95 ’s book , the heroine does n’t wear knickers at all			0
feminine : @entity0 approved of the sensuous silks and subtle prints in @entity22 's range with @entity110 - @entity109 when @entity113 entrepreneurs @entity114 and @entity115 took risque underwear mainstream in 1994 , they proved sexiness was n’t just the province of men in dirty raincoats			1
@entity121 and @entity122 stripped off for the brand and it went global , with @entity114 and @entity124 reported to have sold 80 per cent of their business for a cool £ 60 million in 2007			2
smalls are big business , as also evidenced by @entity19 ’s flagship store on @entity130			0
women , these days , see no contradiction between femininity and feminism			0
outrageous underwear is part of our seduction tool kit			0
i ’m an underwear addict and love sexy smalls , but i do n’t want to buy them from @entity22			1
why ? well , there ’s enough pressure on women to act like sex objects 24/7 without @entity22 wading in			1
it ’s like finding an old and trusted friend is moonlighting as a stripper			0
when i split from my husband at the age of 55 , one of the first things i did was go on an underwear binge on a just - in - case basis			2
i bypassed @entity22 and spent an entire day at @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 before settling for three bra - and - pants sets ( one in jade , one in raspberry and one in black ) , plus several pairs of hold ‑ ups , which set me back close to £ 300			1
traditional market : @entity22 lingerie is usually popular because of its comfort over style even though i was worrying about how i was going to pay my bills , i felt this was an indulgence i deserved			1
it was many months before anyone actually got to see any of it , but these subtly sexy sets under my jeans and t - shirts gave me a confidence boost when i needed it most			2
and that ’s where the @entity22 range goes wrong - it seems more about pandering to male fantasies than quietly making women feel good about themselves			1
with the multitude of straps and bondage - like constructions , i ’m reminded of the @entity189 in @entity7 rather than getting the support i want when i wear something tight and want to avoid anyone glimpsing bulging back fat or a post-menopause pot belly			2
of course , this bizarre departure from its heartland style could have a lot to do with the fact that the foundations of @entity22 ’s underwear department have been crumbling for some time			1
in january this year , @entity201 , former chief creative officer at @entity19 and original founder of the @entity204 chain , was hauled in to revamp @entity22 ’s lingerie			1
but by april , she had resigned , citing excessive red tape and meddling from on high , with insiders hinting there was a culture clash			0
misguided revamp : @entity0 fears the new range could alienate die - hard customers of the ailing store then last week , @entity22 reported its lowest pre-tax profits for eight years , at just £ 564 million , compared to £ 658 million a year ago			1
this decline took place before @entity22 hired its latest weapon , @entity26 , 51 , to stop the rot			1
but it seems that instead of underpinning her new strategy with underwear that ’s as on - the - button as her classic outerwear , what women really want has been roundly ignored in favour of lingerie likely to attract headlines			1
which is strange , as underwear is big business at @entity22			1
it remains the nation ’s leading retailer , selling more than 61 million pairs of knickers a year , with different shapes and sizes , ranging from six to 28			0
they say one in three women buy their lingerie at @entity22			1
what do they think this misguided revamp will achieve ? new direction : @entity26 is @entity22 's latest style director of course , i expect @entity22 to modernise along with the rest of the @entity251 , but is n’t the point that @entity22 has always embodied traditional values ? i go to there to feel safe and comfortable			1
i expect good value for money			0
when i talk to my friends , all ‘ women of a certain age ’ , they want the same things from the @entity22 underwear department : sales people on the floor who can actually advise you ( i ’ve not been able to find one there for years , at least not without a 20 - minute hunt and then practically having to beg for help ) ; shapewear that does n’t constrict ; knickers that do n’t leave you worrying about a visible panty line ; and bras that give you a boost without looking like armour			1
the words ‘ flattering ’ and ‘ feminine ’ come up often ; the word ‘ sexy ’ , in relation to @entity22 , never			2
‘ i love saucy underwear , ’ says one friend , ‘ but i ’m just not in the mood for it when i go to @entity22			2
i mean , the lighting ’s enough to put you off for a start - you can see every lump and wobble			0
‘ i ’ll get my sexy knicker kicks elsewhere , thank you			0
’ another friend scoffs when i showed her the publicity pictures			0
‘ i ’m 56 and a size 16			0
i ’d feel an idiot trussed up like that			0
’ my 60 - year - old neighbour remarks : ‘ if i suddenly came into the boudoir wearing that after 30 years of marriage , i think my husband would have a heart attack			2
’ it seemed to me that @entity22 was getting something very right when it launched model @entity110 ’s range last year			2
the sensuous silks and subtle prints made for a distinctly feminine collection that was a huge sales hit and is still going strong			0
so why it has veered off in this bordello direction is a mystery			0
so , dear @entity22 , for whom i still have a lingering affection , please get your initials in order			2
repeat after me : @entity311 is just not required			0
leave that to other shops and stick to classy , classic cuts			0
perhaps the time has come for your customers to whip you into shape , rather than the other way around .			0

@entity25 / @entity24 lingerie line *includes* lacy hold - ups and plunging bodysuit
but @entity22 's shoppers want classic , comfortable fit says @entity0 , 60
she said they *'re* pandering to male fantasies
