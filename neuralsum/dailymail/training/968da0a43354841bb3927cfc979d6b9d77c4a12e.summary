when @entity2 the elderly goldfish developed swim bladder disease , the future looked bleak			1
the ailment , which is common in aquarium fish and controls their buoyancy , caused him to turn upside down and sink to the bottom of the tank			2
but now things are looking up , after his owner @entity12 , 32 , from @entity13 , made him his very own life jacket			1
warehouse worker mr @entity12 , 32 , said : ' @entity2 's been suffering with ill health on and off for about two years			1
' he 's always been a fighter so when he sunk to the bottom one day and could n't get back up again it was a very sorry sight			2
' it broke my heart to see him so helpless			0
' i started looking at floating aids and saw one where an owner kept his koi carp afloat by attaching it to a wine bottle cork but that looked quite painful			2
' i wanted to build something that would allow @entity2 to move his fins a little bit and be comfortable at the same time			0
' mr @entity12 spent three hours designing the life jacket from fish tank aeration tubes , and adjusted the fit so it comfortably cradled @entity2			1
he added : ' he wriggled a bit a first and he was n't too keen on the idea			0
' he kept catching on to plants and getting stuck but since i 've rearranged the tank to make it disability friendly he 's been absolutely fine			0
' things are going swimmingly : @entity2 now has to be fed using a straw because his life jacket stops him getting to the surface disability : swim bladder disease is a common ailment among aquarium fish and affects their buoyancy the float means that @entity2 can not reach the surface to feed so @entity12 drops him food through a tube which he lowers into the water			1
if the fish is particularly unwell he can pick him up with his little life jacket to make sure he gets the food			1
@entity12 said he is now looking forward to teaching new tricks to @entity2 , who shares his tank with fellow goldfish @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity73 , he said : ' they 're one big happy family now , but he 'll have to wear it for the rest of his life			1
' people have said i 'm crazy but every animal is a valued family member and i do my best to help every one of them			0
' i 've tried to train all of my fish but @entity2 's really shone above the rest - he 's my star pupil			0
' he can already swim through my fingers and through hoops using a feeding wand			2
i was just getting him into fish football before he got sick			0
' people can be dismissive of goldfish as pets but they are intelligent animals as @entity2 proves			0

@entity95 suffers from swim bladder disease which affects buoyancy
owner @entity12 , 32 , made him a life jacket out of recycled tubing
swimming aid allows him to swim the right way up and even perform tricks
