in the past year solar power in the @entity1 has more than doubled while in the @entity3 it has grown by 30 per cent			0
but many current systems fail to solve the problem of how energy is managed and used overnight when the sun sets			2
traditionally , energy gathered during the day is sent back to the grid , but this can prove costly if you need to buy it back - unless you have a smart battery that stores the excess energy in your home			2
@entity16 ( pictured ) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels			1
this energy can be used throughout the day , and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down			0
rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid , homeowners can then use their stored supply for power with this in mind , @entity29 firm @entity28 ( @entity30 ) and designer @entity31 have created the @entity16			1

rather than selling this excess electricity to the grid , and potentially having to buy it back at a later date or time , homeowners can use this stored supply to power their home until the sun rises again			0

it additionally has a sleep mode that ensures the storage system never runs low and will automatically go into standby when not in use although it is designed to be completely independent of the national power grid , it can equally be wired up in the case of emergency			2
for example , whenever there is energy in the battery available , the connection to the grid is locked			2

the system comes in different sizes ranging from the @entity16 300 , which is 4.8 @entity101 , to the @entity16 600 at 8.06 kwh up to the 1000 model which offers 13.44 kwh			1

if a home is predominantly powered by the grid , the @entity16 will still store energy and instead act like a generator during a power cut			2
' we wanted to create a storage system that makes you truly independent of the national power grid , that adequately supplies all of your household appliances at all times , and that remains efficient and trouble - free for at least 20 years , so that you can have the peace of mind that your investment really is worth every penny , ' said the firm			0

the firm said an average home can save around € 1,200 a year ( £ 876 ) , so it would still take around seven years to recoup the costs , but the system will last for 20 years .			1

@entity16 was designed by @entity31 and @entity29 firm @entity30
its lithium iron phosphate battery stores energy from solar panels
*cheapest* model is € 8,450 ( £ 6,170 ) , but it will save money on electricity *bills*
it also comes with ' intelligent management system ' that controls current
