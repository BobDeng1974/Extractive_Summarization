these pictures show @entity1 , the world 's largest beetle and one of the most mysterious creatures on the planet			1

@entity1 is the world 's largest beetle but is one of the most mysterious creatures on the planet			2
the @entity20 beetle can grow up to seven inches long and has a jaw so strong that it can snap a wooden pencil in two the insect hides away in @entity25 's humid tropical rainforests and only ventures out to find a mate			1
intriguingly the larvae of the giant insect has never been seen			2
however , scientists believe that the grubs are two inches in diameter and can be up to a foot long			1
judging by large boreholes found in dead trees , scientists believe the grubs feed on decaying wood underground for several years before they are fully grown , the male beetle does not feed during its adult life but needs energy to fly			1
the energy comes from the reserves it gathered in its pupa stage and is used to fly just long enough to find a mate			1
the creature is so large that it does not have enough energy to fly from the ground so instead must climb trees and launch itself from a branch before it actually takes to the air			0
females wait for the males to find them and fertilise their eggs so are consequently very rarely seen			0
the male beetle ( pictured ) does not feed throughout its adult life but needs energy to fly			1
this energy comes from the reserves it gathered in its pupa stage and is used to fly just long enough to find a mate they defend themselves by hissing in warning and then use their huge jaws to bite attackers			1
the @entity20 beetle also has incredibly strong legs and sharp claws that can tear animal and human flesh , but reportedly do not attack unless provoked			2
they live in the rainforests of @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , the @entity80 and @entity81 , where locals attempt to catch them after dark with bright lights			0
while many people try and avoid the fearsome beetle , some tourists pay a lot of money to attempt to see the insect in its natural habitat			0
indeed the creature is a brilliant example of a successful eco-tourism initiative			0
the largest @entity20 beetle ever discovered was a staggering 16.7 centimetres long and was found in @entity97			0
a specimen of a normal - sized beetle can cost up to Â£ 400			0

larvae of the insect giant has never been seen but scientists believe it could be a foot long and around two inches wide
the male does not feed throughout its adult life and uses all its energy flying for just long enough to find a mate
