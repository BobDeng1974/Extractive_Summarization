the deputy prime minister is preparing defy his grassroots to refuse to campaign in 2015 on a promise to scrap £ 9,000 tuition fees			1
but as new figures showed @entity5 membership has slumped by a third in three years , a survey of activists revealed most would prefer to see @entity7 ’s @entity17 installed as prime minister next time round			1
choice : @entity5 members overwhelmingly prefer the idea of @entity7 returning to power after the 2015 election choice : @entity2 is under pressure from @entity5 members to shun a new coalition with try @entity28 ( left ) to form a power - sharing deal with @entity7 's @entity17 ( right ) a survey of members by @entity5 voice shows 40 per cent want to their party to form a full coalition with @entity7 after the 2015 general election , compared to just 13 per cent who want a repeat of the power - sharing deal with @entity28 ’s @entity39			1
a further 15 per cent would like a ‘ confidence and supply ’ agreement with @entity7 , which would stop short of a coalition and leave the @entity5 free to vote on an issue - by - issue basis , but agree not to bring down the government or vote against its budget			2
it means more than half ( 55 per cent ) of @entity5 members want to see some form of arrangement with @entity7 compared to fewer than 1 in 5 ( 18 per cent ) who want to return to power with the @entity39			1
@entity7 's income in 2012 was around £ 2.75million more than that of the conservatives and @entity5 combined			1
@entity17 's party had a total income of just over £ 33million and spent around £ 30.2 million			1
it compared to an income of £ 24.2 million and expenditure of £ 23.3 million for @entity28 's @entity39			2
meanwhile , @entity2 's @entity5 took in just over £ 6 million and spent more than £ 6.4 million however the accounts , released by the @entity62 , also @entity7 's membership also dropped , from 193,961 in 2010 and 193,300 in 2011 to 187,537 last year			1

both the @entity66 and the @entity68 @entity67 bucked the trend of falling membership figures			0
the @entity66 saw membership soar from 16,232 in 2010 to 24,732 in 2012 , on the back of the party 's capture of overall control in @entity76 , while @entity77 's @entity67 has grown from 15,535 in 2010 to 20,409 last year			2

the @entity66 had an income of £ 2.3 million in 2012 , @entity67 £ 1.2 million and the @entity79 £ 462,450			0
@entity81 , editor of @entity82 , said : ‘ tactically , it makes sense for the @entity5 to want to choose @entity7 next time : it would show the party is n’t simply an adjunct to the @entity39 but can work with both other major parties if that ’s how the public votes			1
‘ on a principled basis , @entity7 ’s position on a range of big economic issues - tax - cuts for the low - paid , the ‘ mansion tax ’ , ending universal benefits for wealthier pensioners - has moved towards the @entity5 ’ in recent months			2
’ latest data from the @entity62 showed the @entity5 took in just over £ 6 million in donations in 2012 , and spent more than £ 6.4 million			0
the accounts also showed revealed a steep decline in membership for the @entity5 , down from 65,038 in 2010 to 48,934 in 2011 and 42,501 last year			2
the stage is set for another stand - off between mr @entity2 and his members at the party ’s annual conference in @entity108 in september			1
the party leader intends to go into the general election with an explicit pledge to keep annual university tuition fees of £ 9,000			1
@entity5 will be asked to back the plans to retain the controversial fees , a move which would allow it to become a manifesto promise			0
the fallout of the row over tuition fees has hung over the party since it fought the 2010 election opposing increases before swiftly agreeing to introduce significantly higher costs			1
mr @entity2 later apologised for breaking the pledge in a video that was quickly spoofed and went viral on the web			0
last month , he told party members that the 2015 manifesto will make a clear distinction between ‘ commitments ' and ' ambitions ' and will also spell out the party 's red lines for any coalition negotiations			0
policy papers have been drawn up by the @entity5 higher education working group , led by @entity138 @entity137 , which dismiss calls to reduce the fees to £ 6,000 or replace them with a graduate tax			2
it recommends retaining the £ 9,000 limit with a new government then reviewing the policy			2
party sources said that work would focus on how effective the policy had been			0
under @entity5 rules , proposals must be backed at its conference to become party policy			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this will be debated at conference			0
’ not again : only 13 per cent of @entity5 members surveyed by @entity82 want to see a repeat of the coalition with the conservatives a senior @entity5 source told @entity163 : ‘ we know that we must not go into the next election making unrealistic promises that we wo n't be able to keep			0
‘ everyone from grass - roots activists to government ministers has taken flak on this and we all emerged from that experience bruised , so we are determined not to repeat the mistake			0
‘ that experience has taught us all the importance of realistic , costed policies that we can be confident could be delivered in government			0
‘ that 's why we have thoroughly examined the current system and the alternatives and have concluded that we should stick with the current system and review it once it has been given a proper chance to bed in			0

majority of activists would prefer to see @entity17 's party in power
