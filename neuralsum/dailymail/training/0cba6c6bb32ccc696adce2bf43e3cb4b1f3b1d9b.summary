by @entity1 reporter published : 12:49 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:38 est , 7 march 2014 the dating app @entity4 has come under fire over a ‘ slut - shaming ’ safe sex ad that is appearing in fictitious female profiles			1
the campaign , created by the @entity9 , suggests to male users that they may catch an std from hooking up with female @entity4 users with the tagline : ' you 're probably not her only match			1
' responses to the ad have been vitriolic , with @entity21 users calling it ‘ disgusting ’			2
the campaign : @entity4 has been accused of slut - shaming for a campaign created by the @entity9 @entity26 , @entity27 wrote : ' this actually makes me sick			1
’ another , @entity31 , responded : ‘ two steps forward , one step back ... ’ and @entity32 , said that ‘ slut - shaming just needs to stop			0
’ according to a video about the campaign , published by the @entity40 advertising firm behind it , @entity39 , @entity4 's male users reach the message through fake female profiles			1
each shows photos of an attractive woman posing suggestively alongside multiple partners			0
the last photo in the fictitious profile ’s slideshow reveals the app 's controversial message			0
a representative for @entity4 told @entity54 that it was ‘ not involved with this @entity59 project in any way ’ – and indeed it does seem that the app is simply being used as a platform for the @entity9 message			1
the @entity61 , which initially noticed the ad , argues that the @entity9 campaign is still effective , despite the anger surrounding it			0
‘ to be fair , the campaign is clever — what better way to spread a positive social message than to broadcast it on an app used by millions every day ? ’ writes reporter @entity66			0
‘ and it ’s never a bad idea to advocate for safer sex practices , especially on a platform that ’s implicitly , if not explicitly , used primarily to find casual sex partners			0
’ tagline : the campaign has been named the @entity78 , but @entity4 has denied involvement in its creation how it works : the app has installed multiple fake profiles that feature attractive people posing with multiple partners of the opposite sex , telling men to use protection to protect against @entity89 the site concurs with critics , however , that the ‘ social message is compromised by blatant slut - shaming			1
’ but while @entity39 ’s video tells us that ‘ having a one - night - stand has never been easier , ’ @entity4 ’s 27 - year - old creator insists otherwise			2
@entity98 told the @entity99 in december that @entity4 is n’t a hook - up app , ‘ because women are n’t wired that way			2
’ @entity4 does not reveal how many users it has , but recently disclosed that it facilitates around 750million profile ratings per day , leading to more than 5million matches			2
the platform ’s international growth has become so astounding that @entity4 says it plans to expand to @entity111 by the end of this year .			0
