forgive the gross presumption in offering career advice to @entity2 , but he has given his father ’s management the flick and told @entity8 ’s @entity7 their services are no longer needed			1
he , a novice in such entanglements , is now negotiating his own future , albeit with the help of a lady lawyer of impeccable and long - standing loyalty to the family			2
we are told by @entity17 that a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the season is a formality			1
@entity2 has said he wants to sign it			1
@entity17 driver @entity2 celebrates his win at the season - opening race in @entity26 , @entity27 - but is yet to sign a new deal with the team @entity2 's current @entity17 contract runs out at the end of this season and no new deal has been agreed yet yet four months after he won the world championship in @entity35 , there is only one important fact : no deal has been concluded			1
it is literally only an afternoon ’s job sorting out the terms of a contract if there is a willingness on both sides to tie it all up			2
so why the delay ? it may be that @entity2 is holding out for the salary he wants			1
it is not £ 1million a week he seeks , despite some reports to the contrary			0
it is probably about € 1m – or the piffling matter of £ 720,000 according to the current exchange rate			2
perhaps the two sides will yet come to a mutually agreeable financial arrangement			0
but , as one of my mentors advised me about the chicanery of the paddock , there is a reason behind everything in @entity65			1
mercedes say a new contract is a formality while @entity2 says he wants ti sign , so why the delay ? @entity2 celebrates his @entity27 gp win in front of second - placed @entity73 and @entity74 i hope that the delay is because @entity2 is seeking a move to @entity77			1
@entity78 ? no. by the end of the season , he hopes to have emulated his hero @entity81 in winning three world titles – the number that most clearly defines a driver ’s status in the pantheon			1
what has he got to lose ? such is @entity81 ’s immortal fame that here in @entity27 , from where i write this , @entity81 ’s face is still emblazoned on billboards advertising @entity93 watches			0
never mind that he died in 1994			0
before his fatal accident at the @entity97 , @entity81 , as has since become common knowledge , talked to @entity77 about racing for them			1
i suspect scratching the itch that @entity81 could not - namely , competing for the sport ’s most evocative marque - would mean more to @entity2 than the possibility of clocking up win after win , title after title			1
he has never been a chaser of records for their own sake			0
that kind of thing is for @entity74 and the birds			1
@entity74 joined @entity77 ahead of the new season after six seasons driving for @entity117 the @entity118 finished third in his first race for the @entity77 in @entity26 eight days ago however , there is no reason why @entity77 , with their vast resources , could not deliver title - winning cars for him			1
then , he would have won championships with three teams , @entity128 , @entity17 and @entity77			1
his status would be further embellished			0
another tantalising , legend - making prospect is a straight fight in identical machinery between @entity2 and @entity74			1
@entity2 , like @entity133 , thinks himself a better racer than @entity74 , who , so the theory goes , was flattered by his @entity117 car in winning four world titles			1
by replacing @entity138 , whose contract runs out at the end of the season , @entity2 could prove what he has always believed			1
i can hear the chorus of the cautious			0
mercedes are a super-team ; @entity77 are in upheaval and struggling for form			1
yes , but success in sport is often cyclical			0
@entity77 are fabulously well - resourced			1
and who knows whether the team that @entity153 built at @entity17 will thrive so dominantly in the long run ? will @entity155 and @entity156 work harmoniously if the wheels fall off ? how will @entity159 ’s scattergun style of chairmanship play out ? if @entity2 wants to be bold and take the plunge , he has a big ally at @entity77			1
i hear from unimpeachable sources that the @entity77 ’s president , @entity165 , rates @entity167 top of the drivers available to him			1
@entity74 won four consecutive world championships as @entity117 dominated @entity65 it seems journalism is not a crime , @entity173 i hope it wo n’t spoil our next very agreeable lunch if i point out to @entity173 that it has emerged from the @entity178 that journalism is not a criminal offence , after all			1
for , in a blow to the former @entity187 president 's censorship - seeking pressure group hacked off , four @entity182 journalists were cleared last week of paying public officials for stories in a case that delved far into the ethics of the @entity192			1
my trade 's hero of the court is mr @entity196 for his reaction to the prosecution ’s haughty counsel , mr @entity198 , who implied that the @entity182 ’s chief reporter , @entity200 , was wrong to describe the death in @entity202 of prince @entity205 ’s @entity204 mentor as ‘ a belting exclusive splash ’			2
the judge said : ‘ the mere fact of it being a tragedy does not stop it being a good story			0
’ @entity210 suffered a horrific crash at the @entity212 @entity97 in october last year this reminded me of a furore after @entity210 ’s awful accident in @entity216 last year			2
several bloggers – some of whom , we note , have never remotely held down a staff job at a blue chip media organisation – fulminated piously on their websites about the supposed insensitivity of at least one of my @entity226 colleagues in seeking facts and answers from @entity210 ’s @entity230 team and the @entity187 in those worrying hours immediately after the crash			0
the critics did not understand that when a sports event immediately becomes a news inferno , the reporter must adapt			2
it was not insensitivity that led journalists to ask detailed questions of those whose job it was to answer them ; it was a professional requirement			0
i shall stop being sanctimonious myself , now			0
but if anyone doubts the sense of what i say , i cite mr @entity196			0
former @entity187 president @entity173 arrives the @entity246 in @entity247 for the @entity248 it 's a shame to lose the @entity118 @entity97 it is bad enough being a @entity252 visitor @entity253 when the @entity27 team are blazing their way towards cricket 's @entity257 final and the boys who briefly masqueraded as the @entity261 team are already back and badly bruised in @entity262			2
but it is not only born and bred @entity27 to be dodged			0
there was also the @entity266 - supporting taxi driver in @entity26 , who dissected @entity261 ’s failings , brought me up to date with @entity270 ’s latest political plans and was about to fly next morning to @entity271 to watch his @entity273 team lose , as it predictably turned out , to @entity27			1
then you go to @entity275 and are driven back from @entity276 by a @entity278 taxi driver			2
he hoots with laughter at how his heroes gave our lot a national disgrace of a caning			0
@entity261 were dumped out of the @entity257 after a defeat by @entity287 earlier this month but it was still a rare thrill to go to the giant bowl of the @entity291 to watch one of the 49 days of cricket in this absurdly protracted competition			0
sitting in the members ’ area , we could visit the library , sip refreshments in reasonable comfort and gawp at the galleries of pictures of heroes like @entity304 , who , as captain of the 1932 - 33 ‘ @entity307 ’ team , led the most notorious touring party to these shores since the @entity310			2
a few hours after returning from the @entity291 it was announced that the @entity118 @entity97 was off			0
like most @entity65 devotees , i was sorry			2
this is a heritage race			0
but could either @entity118 venue , the @entity316 or @entity317 , claim that they offered a world - class experience for punters or the travelling @entity65 family ? @entity2 drives his mercedes to third in last season 's @entity118 @entity97 at @entity317 @entity65 is missing the voice of @entity325 @entity27 television sport is said to be a tough and jealous business			1
especially so if you sound as @entity261 as @entity329			0
but a few of our chaps have really cracked it : @entity334 and @entity335 , both from cricket , and , spectacularly , @entity325			0
@entity325 ’s friend and successor , @entity339 , told me once that by his reckoning only sir @entity342 and , possibly , @entity341 stood higher in the esteem of @entity27 motor - racing than our own high - decibel warbler			2
reflecting on the dissatisfied response to the first race of the season in @entity26 , i wondered how different perceptions among tv viewers would have been if @entity325 had been behind the microphone rather than watching , headphones on , from the study of his @entity357 home			0
the famous @entity65 commentator @entity325 had the ability doubled the excitement levels just by being there for all the blanket coverage provided by @entity365 ’s pioneering crack team , and the @entity367 ’s excellent professional output , there is no longer that one voice which doubles the excitement levels just by being there			2
transcendent commentators come along in any sport once in a generation , if we are lucky			0
@entity375 was one such golden larynx in athletics , a sport that has lost a little of its allure since he left it			0
@entity325 , on two continents , was another .			0

@entity2 's current @entity17 deal expires at the end of this season
mercedes say a new contract for the world champion is a formality
@entity2 says he wants to extend his stay , so why the delay ?
hopefully the 30 - year - old is holding out for a move to @entity77
@entity2 could finally prove that he is a better driver than @entity74
