by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 13:18 est , 10 april 2012 misconduct : capt. @entity3 is said to have been at the centre of late night , alcohol - fulled parties in @entity6 late night alcohol - fulled parties and skinny dipping in a canal are a few of the reasons captain @entity3 was fired as a commodore in @entity6 last year , according to a new report			1
when he was sacked from his position in the 5th fleet , the @entity15 would only say that there was a ' loss of confidence ' in his ability to command and that an investigation into ' alleged inappropriate conduct ' was continuing			1
but now a report in the @entity26 has claimed that the commanding officer nicknamed ' @entity28 ' was at the centre of a several raucous parties			2
the investigation into @entity3 's relief , was obtained by the paper via a @entity35 request			2
the main incident which led to @entity3 , 45 , being discharged from the @entity15 is alleged to have happened last june , after a full day of drinking at a glamorous apartment complex called the @entity39			1
the host , reportedly a junior officer , had just moved into the complex and threw a house - warming party , inviting a mix of colleagues from her command , friends and neighbours			0
she surprised her guests when she stripped off her bikini top , but was soon joined by another male and female who went skinny dipping with her in the canal			0
witnesses said that was when capt. @entity3 , the most senior officer at the party and commodore of the logistics task force responsible for supplying all naval assets in 5th @entity62 , removed his bathing suit and swam naked in the water			1
according to investigators , the canal is in the middle of the luxurious complex , so their naked frolics were in ' plain view ' of neighbors and people walking past on the street			0
over the next five months , the junior officer 's home became the location of many more parties - including fancy dress such as toga and wear - a - tie night			2
party hub : the @entity39 complex in @entity6 was the centre of raucous the parties			1
last june after a full day of drinking witnesses said the commodore removed his bathing suit and swam nude in the water , with the topless party host fired : capt. @entity3 , left , shakes hands with capt. @entity90 after relieving him as commander , @entity92 ( @entity93 ) 53 at a ceremony at @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity6 at a lingerie party , where guests wore pajamas and silky lingerie , @entity3 donned a bathrobe and what appeared to be either a swimsuit or boxers underneath - although one @entity106 at the party later remembered them as ' black silk shorts			1
' damning find : the investigation into @entity3 's relief , was obtained by @entity26 via a @entity35 request on one occasion , the party - goers jumped onboard a boat belonging to a @entity117 couple who lived in the complex , leaving a mess of drink stains , cigarette butts and rubbish			2
' we are in a region where our behavior is repeatedly stressed to us from the minute we get off the plane , ' one officer , who left the party disgusted after seeing @entity3 swim naked , told investigators in a sworn statement			0
' but seeing these rules openly violated by the chain of command makes me wonder how seriously it is taken , ' he said reported the @entity26			0
the parties did not slip completely under the radar - neighbours , and other officers complained , saying such behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the @entity142 country			0
@entity3 was at the centre of the parties - he emailed junior officers from his government computer account to help arrange parties and texted them on his official @entity148 organsing to meet up at clubs and bars			1
but @entity3 's hedonistic lifestyle took a toll on his reputation among other colleagues who did not attend the parties , but heard the stories - officers began to feel that an ' in - crowd ' had formed around him and began to think he was only picking his fellow party goers for trips abroad and awards			1
@entity15 @entity6 : @entity3 's firing prompted major changes for the @entity15 in the country - 5th @entity62 prohibited all drinking on - and off - base from midnight until 6 a.m. , every day of the week staff who knew of the wild parties were too worried about their position if they reported @entity3 ’s indiscretions - it was made more tricky as one staff officer said that both the legal officer and the command ’s equal opportunity manager frequently attended the parties			1
if he came forward , one officer said , his expectation was : ' i will get crushed			0
' once a complaint was finally made via email to rear adm. @entity183 , deputy commander of @entity184 , events changed very quickly			0
five months after the skinny dipping party , @entity3 was relieved in mid-october by vice adm. @entity186 , 5th @entity62 commander , becoming the 19th of 22 cos fired in 2011			2
unwelcome : capt. @entity3 's behaviour in @entity6 , was not well received - neighbours , and other officers complained , saying such behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the @entity142 country @entity3 received nonjudicial punishment for failure to obey regulations and for conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and three other officers were also reprimanded two weeks after his removal , the 5th @entity62 prohibited all drinking on - and off - base from midnight until 6 a.m. , every day of the week - the new rules includes bars , restaurants , and public spaces , tellingly including canals			1
the damage the parties and raucous behavior caused to relations in @entity6 is unclear			2
@entity62 is ' unaware of any host - nation impact ' from the indecent parties , lt. @entity214 , a spokeswoman for the fleet , said in an emailed reply to questions from the @entity26			0
@entity3 has been reassigned to @entity220 in @entity221 , @entity222 , according to @entity223			0
he did not respond to repeated calls and email requests for comment .			0

capt. @entity3 was fired as a commodore in @entity6 late last year
@entity15 said he was fired because there was a ' loss of confidence ' in him , but new report *suggests* he was at the centre of alcohol - fuelled parties
