migrants have forced tens of thousands of @entity2 out of the workplace , a landmark report warned yesterday			1
an independent panel of advisers found that , between 2005 and 2010 , 160,000 people had been ‘ displaced ’ , or left jobless , by a huge influx of foreign workers			0
for every four migrant workers who come to the country from outside the @entity13 , one @entity2 job is lost , the experts said			1
an increase of 100 foreign - born working - age migrants in the @entity2 was linked to a reduction of 23 @entity2 in employment between 1995 and 2010 , the @entity14 said the @entity14 also criticised the way ministers have used the potential impact on @entity22 , or gdp – the total size of the economy – to decide whether large - scale immigration was desirable			1
professor @entity27 , chairman of the @entity14 , said it had led ‘ inexorably ’ to ‘ pro-immigration ’ policies because more migrants will logically expand the economy			1
he called on ministers instead to consider the impact on schools , hospitals , congestion , crime rates and house prices			1
@entity39 outside the @entity40 in @entity41 seeking a visa which will give them entry to the @entity2 referring to the current system , professor @entity44 said : ‘ the main gainer is the migrant			2
it ’s not the @entity2 resident			2
the focus should be on the @entity2 resident			2
’ @entity53 ministers were last night urged to seize on the findings of the report to impose far stricter border controls			0
to date , the @entity57 have been undermining attempts to crack down on economic migration			0
but , in the first study of its kind , the @entity14 – set up by the last @entity63 government , and independent of @entity65 – said large - scale immigration was having a significant impact on the job prospects of the ‘ native ’ population			1
the report , which follows years of controversy over whether immigration leads to fewer jobs for @entity2 workers , showed that every increase of 100 foreign - born working - age migrants in the @entity2 was linked to a reduction of 23 @entity2 in employment between 1995 and 2010			1
between 2005 and 2010 alone , the number of working - age migrants in employment rose by 700,000 and displaced 160,000 @entity2 - born workers , it said			1
average wages remain the same , the @entity14 said , but the highest wages get higher and the lower wages get lower			0
asked if there would be 160,000 extra jobs for @entity2 workers if there had been no immigration , professor @entity44 said : ‘ yes , that would be a reasonable way of putting it			1
’ it follows a contrasting report by the @entity96 which said the number of immigrants coming to the @entity2 had little or no impact on the number of unemployed			1
the @entity14 report found that house prices and rents are being pushed up by the number of migrants coming to the @entity2			1
it added that migrants will inevitably contribute to the demand for public services , commit crime and generate congestion in the same way any increase in the @entity2 - born population would			2
however , the report concluded that migrants from inside the @entity13 , including @entity116 , have ‘ little or no impact on the native employment rate ’			1
professor @entity44 said : ‘ it may well be that the @entity13 migrants are disproportionately less skilled and it may be that the labour market can adjust			2
’ it is likely that hard - working migrants from countries such as @entity126 are doing jobs which @entity2 workers are unwilling to take			1
sir @entity128 , chairman of @entity129 , said : ‘ this is a thoroughly professional report			0
‘ the committee have had the courage to say straight out that immigration can add to unemployment , especially during a recession			0
‘ they are also right to draw attention to impacts that are harder to quantify such as housing and congestion			0
’ on monday , @entity129 said it would be a ‘ remarkable coincidence ’ if there were no link between a 600,000 rise since may 2004 in the number of eastern @entity146 migrants working in the @entity2 and a 450,000 rise in youth unemployment in the same period			2
immigration minister @entity150 said : ‘ controlled immigration can bring benefits to the @entity2 , but uncontrolled immigration can put pressure on public services , on infrastructure and on community relations			0
‘ this report makes clear that it can also put pressure on the local labour market			0
we thank the @entity14 for its work and will now consider the report more fully as we work to regain control over our immigration system			1
’ research from the @entity96 has contradicted claims by campaigners that foreign workers are crowding the jobs market			0
instead , the institute 's study found that there was ' no association ' between higher immigration and joblessness			0
researchers even suggested the opposite might be the case and immigration acts as an economic stimulus , pushing total employment levels higher and dole claimant numbers lower than they would otherwise have been			0
research from the @entity96 found that there was ' no association ' between higher immigration and joblessness the report said : ' perhaps surprisingly , the interaction between migrant inflows and gdp emerges as positive , indicating that during periods of lower growth , migrant inflows are associated with ... slower [ dole ] claimant growth than would otherwise have occurred			0
' the researchers did concede that the stimulating effects of migration on the overall labour market at a time of recession are likely to be small			0
it follows claims made yesterday by immigration pressure group @entity129 that rising immigration from @entity116 and @entity204 since @entity13 enlargement in 2004 had contributed to a surge in youth unemployment in @entity2 , which is now above one million			1
migrants are ' pushing up house prices ' the @entity211 report also showed that house prices and rents are being pushed up by the number of migrants coming to the @entity2			1
migrants will add 8 per cent to the demand for housing , which ultimately leads to an increase in housing costs , especially in @entity225 , the south and certain parts of @entity219 , it found			0
the report added that migrants will inevitably contribute to the demand for public services , commit crime and generate congestion in the same way any increase in the @entity2 - born population would			1
estimates showed migrants cost schools £ 2,216 per person per year , a third more than the £ 1,662 cost for non-migrants , perhaps because migrants tend to be both young and fertile , the @entity211 said			2
but health services for migrants were likely to cost £ 2,450 per person per year , compared with £ 2,765 for non-migrants , possibly because migrants tend to be young and healthy			0
the report also showed that more than 70 per cent of households headed by skilled migrant workers initially rented , with only 20 per cent owning and living in their own home , compared with 68 per cent of all households in @entity253			0
the @entity211 added that @entity255 migrants were more likely to live in larger metropolitan areas than the average @entity2 national , due to greater employment opportunities and more developed transport systems			1
it also revealed that migrants were likely to make use of public transport , walking , car - sharing or cycling rather than driving in the years immediately following their arrival in the @entity2			2
migrants have a negative impact on the @entity2 road system through the use of their cars , although it is not as great as the impact made by the average @entity2 - born individual as they tend to make less non-work journeys			2
but crime rates were likely to go down as a result of migration because migrants were less likely to commit crime , the report said			0
migrant groups were also found to have more trust in @entity2 political institutions , and to express a higher sense of belonging to @entity2 than the average @entity2 - born individual without any migrant heritage .			0

23 fewer jobs for @entity2 workers for every 100 migrants from outside @entity13 , says report
@entity14 findings contradict different study which says migrants do not keep @entity2 out of work
migrants are also pushing up house prices , @entity211 report finds
