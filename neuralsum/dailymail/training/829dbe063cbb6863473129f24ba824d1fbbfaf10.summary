when the two top teams in @entity2 met on sunday night , it was always going to be a feisty encounter			0
that it was settled by a piece of brilliance , rather than a refereeing howler , was reassuring , but not entirely fitting			0
not only do these two teams not like each other , but there was also a huge amount at stake - neither side had dropped a point yet in the league this season			0
but few could have predicted just how much controversy would be crammed into this clash , during which referee @entity18 awarded three penalties in the first half and showed two red cards in the closing stages , nor the source of the stunning winner			1
it was a goal worthy of winning any game , but this match will be remembered for so much more			0
the controversy began with a @entity25 freekick in the 26th minute			1
@entity65 struck it , and it struck defender @entity68 on the arm , seemingly just outside the box			0
@entity18 awarded a freekick , but , once the @entity25 players had pointed to his magic spray line , clearly inside the area , changed his mind			2
@entity44 dispatched the penalty , @entity49 was sent to the stands for his reaction , apparently immitating playing a violin			2
the referee brandishes a yellow card as @entity26 are awarded a penalty for a clear foul by @entity83 @entity25 had still not conceded in their five league games this season , and would have been confident that @entity44 's penalty was a significant advantage			1
but @entity26 are a different prospect , and this game had much more drama to come			2
just five minutes after going ahead , @entity25 shot themselves in the foot , @entity92 defender @entity83 inexplicably wrestling @entity93 to the floor inside the box			1
if @entity18 was looking for an opportunity to level things up , he could not have asked for a more blatant one			0
@entity93 , like @entity44 , made no mistake from twelve yards			1
@entity93 , who had been wrestled to the ground , picked himself up to level the scores from the spot @entity103 celebrates his goal which put @entity26 in the lead shortly before half time , after @entity107 's pass now it was @entity26 who had a spring their step , and a minute before half time they were ahead			1
@entity107 , the danger - man so often since his move from @entity112 , drove at the defence before slipping in @entity103 , who finished nicely			1
the home support were getting restless - they are not used to being behind - but mr @entity18 was on hand to level things up again just a minute later			2
@entity118 cut in from the left hand side , and as he passed @entity120 , the @entity122 midfielder went to ground			0
contact , if there was any , was minimal			0
where it occured , if anywhere , was the subject of much debate , but @entity18 decided it was just inside , rather than just outside , the box			0
two goals each at half time			1
@entity103 's goal was the stand - out moment of quality in a first half packed with controversy the @entity26 players ca n't believe it as @entity18 awards @entity25 a second controversial penalty before half - time @entity44 made no mistake , converting for the second time into the same corner to make it 2 - 2 in truth , the second half looked like it might not be living up to the drama of the first			1
both sides pushed for the win , but neither looked particularly likely to get it before @entity40 stepped up			2
however , it was only right , in a game like this , that the last word should go to the referee			0
@entity28 , superb until this moment of madness , squared up to @entity32			1
the two clashed heads , but , in truth , neither needed more than a yellow card for what was more handbags than a true fight			0
the referee was back in centre stage			0
veteran @entity174 stars @entity93 and @entity65 exchange words as @entity176 runs to the scene the @entity174 defender got some way off the ground before unleashing the powerful low volley @entity182 celebrates his stunning late winner which keeps @entity25 top of @entity2 @entity40 leads the celebrations as @entity25 maintained their 100 % record at the expense of @entity26 's			1

@entity44 puts @entity25 ahead from penalty spot after referee changes his mind
@entity93 equalises five minutes later with another penalty
@entity26 take the lead through @entity103 after brilliant @entity107 assist
@entity44 makes it 2 - 2 on the stroke of half time after @entity200 penalty
@entity40 volleys home winner in 86th minute from 20 yards
@entity28 and @entity32 see red in final minute
