@entity0 faces a growing headache over his starting line - up to face @entity3 on tuesday night with all his star names desperate to be part of the action			1
the @entity8 boss had planned to rest most of those who battled their way to a bruising and draining @entity13 win over the @entity14			1
but the players have told @entity0 they are keen to face @entity3 in the @entity17 friendly and the @entity19 boss is now rethinking his original plan to hand those on the edge of his first xi a @entity24 start			1
@entity8 skipper @entity25 leads the way during training on monday ahead of the clash with @entity3 @entity0 says his stars are all desperate to play against @entity3 on tuesday @entity30 keeper @entity29 is put through his paces during the session after settling on a line - up over the weekend , @entity0 admitted the issue is now far from decided			1
‘ i had an idea a couple of days ago - but the players who played the other night keep banging on that they are fit enough to play again , ’ he said			2
‘ they ’ re dropping hints everywhere i go			2
‘ i need to rethink my strategy			2
from the training today nobody wanted to be rested , that ’s for sure			1
‘ it was like the first day of pre-season in training			2
we ’ve so many players who want to play			0
there were a few bumps but it was old - school rub it down and get on with it			0
’ despite the @entity62 game dominating the national mindset for the last month , a rare chance to face the @entity57 in a reprisal of the world ’s oldest international fixture holds huge appeal for @entity0 ’s squad			1
‘ i would say a wee bit of that is because it ’s the fixture , ’ he admitted			0
‘ we ’ re only human @entity0 says he has a selection headache for the game at @entity17 @entity0 oversees training on monday as his players try to stake a claim for a starting spot @entity8 star @entity75 was all smiles following friday night 's win against the @entity14 @entity0 takes a moment to mull over a question from reporters during his press conference @entity25 shows off his keepy - uppy skills during training as he prepares to lead his troops into battle ‘ if someone said to us we are playing some team that ’s 70 - odd in the rankings we would n’t be as excited around this table , all of us			1
we only want real , competitive games			0
this is a competitive game for different reasons , even if there are no points available			0
’ @entity0 planned to field the likes of goalkeeper @entity97 , @entity99 ’s @entity98 and @entity101 ’s @entity100 – posted missing from the @entity62 game with a severe virus			1
@entity100 ’s condition has improved , but both he and @entity98 are still doubts after the @entity107 man failed to train on monday			2
that could force @entity0 to turn to old stagers like @entity25 and @entity110 for their second international game in a week – despite an intense workload at club level			1
playing down suggestions of tiredness amongst his squad , the @entity19 boss added : ‘ it ’s not so much the players who say it , it ’s the coaching staff			1
‘ as one famous manager said “ i ’ll tell you when you ’re tired ”			0
when he asked the question “ who ’s tired in here ? ” and some unfortunate kid put their hand up and we just stood by and watch him get terrorised			0
@entity0 grabs a word with @entity133 forward @entity132 @entity134 briefs @entity8 's shot - stoppers before the session near @entity137 ‘ you have to remember @entity138 and @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , they ’ re all playing 60 - odd games			1
the top players ’ mindset is “ play , play , play ” so then what you think is hard work is not hard work to them , it ’s the norm			0
‘ top players now have to play 60 games a season			0
if you want an easy life go to a mediocre @entity158 club and you can get nine weeks break sometimes			0
if you want to be a top player get your mind around playing every week and dealing with that			0
’ opposite number @entity162 arrived with his squad on monday afternoon and immediately took the opportunity to familiarise them with @entity17			2
@entity162 is buoyed by last year ’s 3 - 2 win over @entity8 at @entity168 although a disappointing @entity170 campaign means he does not have to look far for critics			2
@entity172 juggles with the ball as @entity8 's stars looked relaxed ahead of the friendly fixture @entity172 made light work of the slalom during the training session in @entity179 a less than exciting @entity181 qualifying group for @entity3 means the fixture has an added air of importance and @entity162 is looking forward to tasting the white hot atmosphere			1
‘ the fans here , they ’ll certainly give @entity189 and @entity8 incredible support and that ’s something we ’ll have to deal with in terms of not letting it affect us too badly mentally , he said			0
‘ for some of our younger players they wo n’t necessarily have experienced that type of atmosphere in their careers			0
’ when asked which fixture between the two nations stood out in his mind , he replied : ‘ the one that we played last year at @entity168			0
it was an excellent game , very , very close , very well - fought and incredible atmosphere because a lot of @entity19 fans had travelled down to @entity168 for the game			1
‘ it ’s a very exciting game , it ’s a big game			0
we know we ’ll be given a very tough test up here and we know that @entity8 will be very keen to win the game and i ’m certainly hoping that we have the same degree of hope and expectation from our side			1

@entity0 's side looked relaxed during training on monday
@entity19 *boosted* @entity13 qualifying hopes with vital win over @entity62
@entity0 is weighing up whether to make changes against @entity57
