by @entity0 a quarter of women who have an abortion go on to have another one , new figures show			1
and 57 per cent of young women who had an abortion claimed to have been using contraception when they conceived			2
the majority of these women were using short - term methods of contraception , such as the pill or condoms			1
a quarter of women who have an abortion go on to have another one , new figures show ( file picture ) the figures , from reproductive health charity @entity21 @entity20 , also revealed that only 12 per cent of women have used emergency contraception and that the older a woman is , the more likely she is to have had more than one abortion			2
they also showed that a month after having an abortion 86 per cent of women are using contraception , but 67 per cent use their chosen method of contraception for less than a year			1
reasons for stopping include menstrual irregularities and not renewing supply in time to take the @entity13			1
after having an abortion , 63 per cent of the women surveyed were given long - acting reversible contraception – compared to 30 per cent of young women in @entity42 as a whole – and they were more likely to choose these methods of contraception if they had had more than one abortion or if they had had a surgical abortion			1
the researchers analysed five years of @entity21 @entity20 ’s patient data , surveying 430 women - 121 of whom had previously had an abortion – and all of whom were between the ages of 16 and 24			2
although the total number of abortions in @entity42 and @entity61 has gradually declined in recent years , the number of women seeking abortion who had one or more previous abortions is increasing			0
some 57 per cent of people who have an abortion were using contraception when they conceived - most were using the @entity13 or condoms @entity66 , director of policy at @entity21 @entity20 , said : ‘ women have three fertile decades to manage , but too many women are being let down by a lack of on - going support in choosing and using the most effective method of contraception			1
‘ if we tackled the lack of sex and relationship education in schools , invested in contraceptive training for health professionals and bridged the gap between abortion , contraception and sexual health services , we ’d see the rates of unwanted pregnancies plummet			2
’ the researchers say that with typical use , nine in 100 women become pregnant each year while taking the pill and that condoms have a failure rate of 18 per cent			1
this failure rate means that of the people who say condoms are their chosen method of contraception , 18 per cent will actually not be protected from pregnancy each time they have sex			0
this can be because they do not actually use a condom , because they do not use it properly , or because it breaks			0
in contrast , there is a less than one per cent failure rate for long - acting methods of contraception , such as implants and coils			0
ms @entity66 added : ‘ we have got to get better at talking about contraception and abortion			0
one in three women will have an abortion and one in four of them will go on to have another			0
‘ our research shows there is no particular demographic group who are more likely to have abortions – it can happen to any of us			0
but for the majority of women , it was more often the short - term methods that failed them			1
‘ getting this right is also good for the public purse			0
fitting a coil costs about £ 40 and lasts ten years – that ’s less than 8p a week and it repays the @entity130 many times over in abortion or maternity costs			0

the majority of women who conceive while using contraception are taking the @entity13 or using condoms - very few are using longer - term contraceptives
a month after having an abortion , 86 **%** of women are using contraception
but 67 **%** have given up using their chosen contraceptive after a year
common reasons are menstrual *problems* or *forgetting* to pick up the @entity13
