by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 16:02 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 09:48 est , 18 december 2012 four of the tragic child victims of @entity5 gunman @entity4 lived within short walking distance of the $ 1.5 million home the killer shared with his mother , whom he also killed			1
the startling measure of how close knit the community of @entity5 really is comes as it was revealed that one of the victims of the school massacre , six - year old @entity5 , was a neighbor to the 20 - year - old shooter			2
and it is now known that three other victims , @entity5 , 6 , @entity5 , 6 , and @entity5 , 7 , all lived within a one - mile radius of the troubled killer who shot dead 26 people in cold blood , including 20 children 1st grade children at the @entity2 school on friday			2
flowers have been placed at the entrance to the residence of six - year - old @entity5 six - year - old @entity5 and the basketball nets that stand in the driveway of her parent 's home the @entity35 family residence on @entity36 where family 's dog has been spotted patrolling the lawn ' blonde hair and blue eyes ' : @entity5 was described by neighbor @entity42 as ' like a little @entity44 doll ' it is possible to actually see @entity4 's home from the front door of the @entity49 family residence on picturesque @entity50 around those homes , police officers are now patrolling the streets of the affluent neighborhood and have sealed off @entity55 , where @entity4 lived with his mother @entity56 and where @entity57 and @entity58 are grieving the loss of their boy			1
just five minutes walk from there at the junction of a main road is the beautiful family home where @entity5 lived with her parents on picturesque @entity50			1
set atop a high driveway with a police guard currently outside the house , it is possible to actually see @entity4 's home from the front door of the @entity49 family residence			1
@entity49 has been described as ' utterly adorable ' and ' full of life			0
' while her parents have not yet spoken to the media , the @entity76 has learned that they are going through ' indescribable ' pain			0
neighbour @entity42 , 49 , said : ' i just choke up when i think about it			0
' i used to see her waiting for the school bus over the road from our house every day			2
' she had blonde hair and blue eyes - she was like a little @entity44 doll			0
' @entity5 's home in @entity1 , @entity2 , where she was found shot dead from a gunshot wound to the face @entity5 was murdered at her home by son @entity4 who then went on a rampage murdering 20 local school children and several teachers police have sealed off @entity55 , where gunman @entity4 lived with his mother @entity56 and where @entity57 and @entity58 are grieving the loss of their young son @entity105 compounding the sense of a community tragedy , just one street along from @entity50 at @entity108 is where @entity5 lived with his now bereaved parents			1
modest compared to the other properties in the area , the @entity113 's declined to speak to the media and the police officer assigned to their home said that the family was grief stricken			0
and then from there , just a ten minute walk along @entity108 is the home of @entity5 , who lost her life to the random mass shooting that @entity4 inflicted upon the devastated town of @entity5			2
poignantly the family pet patrols the front of the @entity35 family residence on @entity36 , it 's barking the only noise heard on the silent street packed with homes decorated in the most elaborate @entity136 lights			2
in the driveway of the home , basketball nets stand and when @entity142 's distraught mother answered the door she declined to comment			0
@entity5 : a police officer assigned to his parent 's home said the family was grief stricken at @entity108 is the home where @entity5 lived with his now bereaved parents indeed , the close knit community has been hit hard by the tragic events of friday and has closed itself off from the gathered media			1
back on @entity55 , where @entity156 's and the @entity157 's homes are , police patrol cars are parked across the road closing off access to the quiet street			0
all of @entity4 's child massacre victims were first - graders , aged six or seven			1
seven adults , six women who worked at the school , plus @entity4 's mother also died at his hands , before he killed himself			1
the day before his killing spree the 20 - year - old ' goth ' was reported to have visited the school - where he had been a pupil at least a decade ago - and had an ' altercation ' with four members of staff			0
six - year - old @entity5 was a neighbor to the 20 - year - old shooter who murdered him the family house ' @entity177 ' where @entity5 and his family lived before moving to the @entity179 from the @entity180 three of those four are now among the dead			1
however , it was still not clear yesterday precisely what caused @entity4 , a socially awkward loner , to snap , though detectives said they had found ' clues ' thought to be emails , at his mother ' @entity56 's home on @entity55			2
police said they had found ‘ very good evidence ’ they hoped would answer questions about the motives of the 20 - year - old gunman , described by those who knew him as brilliant but remote			0
and investigators said they found no note or ‘ manifesto ’ of the sort they have come to expect after other murderous rampages			0
just one person , a woman who worked at the school , was shot and survived – an unusually small number in a mass shooting – and police lieutenant @entity208 said her testimony would be ‘ instrumental ’ in the case			0
the car driven by @entity2 school shooter @entity4 is towed from @entity5 on sunday a sign for victims of the @entity5 shooting hangs in the window of a women 's dress shop in @entity1 , @entity2			1

@entity5 's family live on the same road as the gunman
@entity5 's parents can see @entity4 's house from their front door
@entity5 and @entity5 also lived in the neighborhood
