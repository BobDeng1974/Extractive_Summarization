by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 15:57 est , 28 january 2014 a leaked @entity3 report has revealed that cancer patients in the @entity5 are being treated with obsolete radiotherapy machines			1
out of 269 machines , known as linear accelerators , 38 are more than 10 years old and should be replaced , while a further 139 are at least eight years old			1
modern machines , such as a state - of - the - art @entity11 machine , give patients better treatment			1
the @entity3 is using radiotherapy machines that are 10 years old and should have been replaced , it has been unveiled			1
file picture the outdated machines , which use radiation to shrink tumours , also kill healthy tissue surrounding the cancer			1
modern machines use a single dose of highly focused radiation , designed to destroy only the tumour and leave the surrounding healthy tissue undamaged			2
the document calls for an urgent review into the machines and states : ' the expected lifespan of a linear accelerator is 10 years			2
' machines older than this are considered outdated and often can no longer deliver modern radiotherapy techniques , which are linked to better patient outcomes			2
' the document , seen by the @entity38 , was blasted by @entity40 mp @entity39			0
she said : ' patients wo n’t be safe if they keep these old machines working			1
' they should be replaced with modern machines fit for the 21st century			1
' she added that the @entity5 is trailing other @entity46 countries in modern radiotherapy treatments			0
the @entity11 is only available in four @entity49 cities			0
@entity50 , chief executive of the charity @entity52 is worried about the revelations in the report			2
he said : ' radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of bowel cancer			1
@entity40 mp @entity39 says the @entity5 is severely lagging behind other @entity46 nations in radiotherapy care ' it ’s vital that patients have access to the latest advanced radiotherapy techniques which target the cancer and cause less damage to surrounding healthy tissue			1
' we ’d be concerned about any apparent inequalities in the treatment of bowel cancer as a result of " outdated " technology			1
' @entity74 , head of policy at @entity76 , said : ' radiotherapy is a life saving treatment , contributing to around four in 10 cancer cures			1
' we want all patients who need it to have access to advanced radiotherapy techniques such as @entity77 that target the tumour more accurately and have fewer side effects			2
' since 2013 the @entity86 has given thousands more patients access to @entity88 and the @entity3 must be in a position to build on this success			1
' a spokesperson from @entity92 said : ' the commissioning of radiotherapy services is the responsibility of @entity92 however the running and replacement of linear accelerators is the responsibility of the individual hospitals where the machines are located			2
' @entity92 is aware of the age of the current national stock of machines and supports the replacement of machines as they reach the end of their operational life			2
to support hospitals with older machines , the @entity109 has recently launched a scheme to assist with purchasing of new linear accelerators			0
' @entity92 and @entity76 will shortly be publishing a document outlining a vision for innovative radiotherapy services			0
this will be used to inform the production of a 5 - year strategy for radiotherapy services			0
' this will be supported by two other pieces of work being carried out by @entity92 , which are close to completion , looking at the current provision of stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy services and the future anticipated capacity and demand			0
' this will allow @entity92 to plan services for patients which are clinically effective , accessible and represent a responsible investment of public monies			0
' radiotherapy is a treatment that involves the use of high - energy radiation			0
it is commonly used to treat cancer			0
almost half of all people with cancer have radiotherapy as part of their treatment plan			1
more than 120,000 patients every year benefit from radiotherapy , which cures more people than cancer drugs			1
tumour cells are destroyed quickly by x-rays , unlike normal cells			0
radiotherapy has to be aimed precisely			0
even the slightest movement – such as the patient breathing – increases the risk of errors			0
it is also sometimes used to treat benign ( non-cancerous ) tumours and other conditions - such as thyroid disease and some blood disorders .			0

one in eight machines are a decade old and should have been replaced
