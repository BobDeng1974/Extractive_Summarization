given the choice , @entity1 veteran @entity0 probably would n't want the formality and fuss of being honored on a military base with men and women standing at attention , dressed in full regalia — even if it was with a fistful of long - overdue medals he waited decades to receive			1
so it 's fitting that the awards were presented to the humble @entity16 - area man monday evening in an informal ceremony at the @entity18 , with family and fellow veterans in attendance and little pomp and circumstance			2
' i thank the lord for watching over me			0
' a couple of dozen people applauded wildly after the medals were presented to @entity0 , who was seated in a wheelchair			1
he lifted his ball cap in recognition , exposing a shock of silver hair			0
' i 've been blessed to come this far in life , ' he said , a tear streaming down one cheek			0
' i thank the lord for watching over me			0
' @entity33 's @entity59 said @entity0 visited the site of the former pow camp in @entity62 next to a now defunct copper mine where he was put to forced labor			1

@entity0 , who lives in @entity70 in northeastern @entity71 , served as an infantry machine gunner in the @entity73			1
he is also a survivor of the @entity27 in the @entity74 in 1942 , when the @entity33 military forced tens of thousands of @entity36 and @entity74 soldiers to trek for 65 miles with little food or water in blazing heat			1
as many as 11,000 died along the way			2
pow : @entity0 spent time in a torturous pow camp in @entity62 , @entity33 , after surviving the @entity27 it 's not clear why @entity0 did n't get his medals before now , but such occurrences with awards are not uncommon in the military			1
' it continues to trouble me that there are instances where service members do not receive the service medals they have earned through the course of their careers , ' said @entity36 sen. @entity96 , whose office contacted the military three weeks ago about the missing medals			0
' but it is extremely rewarding for me and my staff to be able to help veterans and active - duty members receive the honors they have fought for			2
' retired maj. gen. @entity104 , @entity71 's secretary of military and veterans ' affairs , said most veterans were — rightly — more focused on reuniting with their families than chasing after military ribbons when they returned after the war			0
@entity104 presented the medals to @entity0 during the airport ceremony			2
@entity114 : @entity0 survived the @entity27 at the hands of the @entity33			1
11,000 people were killed during the march @entity16 veteran @entity118 , who served in the @entity119 , helped @entity0 and his family to find out why his medals had n't been issued			1
for the past 10 years or so , @entity122 has helped recognize about 150 area veterans by memorializing their names , ranks and branches of service on granite plaques that are presented to them and their families			0
' i have a passion for these servicemen , ' @entity122 said earlier monday			0
' they just sacrificed so much			0
it does n't matter to me whether they were a cook or a four - star general , just for them to get this million - dollar smile on their face when they know they are n't forgotten			0
