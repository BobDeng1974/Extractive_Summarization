by @entity0 published : 03:12 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 29 may 2013 for a dazzling 24 hours , beauty pageant contestant @entity2 felt like a queen - she had been crowned @entity3			1
but just a day after receiving her crown the winner was abruptly told that her reign was over - because competition organisers had made a huge mistake in their counts			1
a mathematical error meant ms @entity2 was named the winner , when she was actually the third runner up			1
@entity2 's reign as @entity3 was a brief one - she was notified of the mistake 24 hours after being told she was the winner the crown really belonged to @entity16 , from @entity17 , @entity18			1
ms @entity2 , a biomedical sciences graduate who has a black belt in @entity20 and a grade 8 in piano , was left devastated after officials realised the terrible mix - up			2
the real winner ! @entity16 was crowned @entity26 after the mistake pageant director @entity29 said : ' during the validation of the computerized scoring results ( which occurs the following day ) , a typo was discovered in the top five entries , which significantly impacted the final results of the competition , ' the @entity28 reported			1
' this is the first instance of this type of error in the 11 years that @entity39 ( @entity40 ) has produced the @entity3 pageant			1
' this is an unfortunate circumstance where a human error was made , and in such a situation , as difficult as it is , it is only right to correct the error			0
' mr @entity29 apologised to ms @entity2 , from @entity48 , who dreams of a career in the medical or science field focusing on cancer			2
now the title has been transferred to the real winner , ms @entity16 , the @entity28 reported			1
ms @entity16 had already flown back to @entity18 when the mistake was realised - but has been reunited with her crown			1
the 26 - year - old true winner studied engineering and previously served in the armed forces when she was a teenager , enrolled in the @entity59 with 15 @entity60			2
she said on the @entity62 website in the run up to the competition : ' becoming the next @entity3 means much more than merely winning a crown			2
' it would give me the opportunity to serve my country and empower women to achieve their dreams			0
not everyone aspires to be a beauty queen , but everyone deserves to achieve their dream			0
' as a woman who believes in a beautiful mind and spirit , i hope to encourage more young women to become the movers and shakers in any field of their choosing			0
' but despite the profuse apology , the humiliating error could still be seen on the beauties of @entity89 website , with correct winner @entity16 announced at the top of the page , but the proclamation that @entity2 was @entity3 further down			1
created in 2002 , the ' beauties of @entity89 ' @entity95 has the exclusive rights to send a @entity89 representative to the @entity98			0
the mortifying mistake comes after a controversial row last year - when a transgender competitor was initially banned from entering the competition			0
@entity103 , then 23 , competed with 61 contestants and was among the final 12 contestants			0
( from left to right ) @entity106 , seen in 2011 with miss @entity109 world @entity107 , and miss @entity112 universe @entity110 , in @entity113 for a charity event for the @entity115 mortifying mistake : the @entity3 2013 website still shows the error - which incorrectly names @entity2 as the winner the @entity122 , @entity123 , native was initially denied entry to @entity89 's pageant because she was not a natural - born female			1
she had already reached the finals of the @entity98 @entity122 pageant before officials stepped in after it was claimed she lied on her application about her natural - born gender			2
the only requirement stated on the @entity3 website is that to enter , women must be a @entity89 citizen and between the ages of 18 and 27			0
the application form made no mention of rules regarding sexual reassignment surgery			0
@entity144 activists claimed the organisation was being discriminatory , and more than 20,000 people signed a virtual petition on @entity148 demanding that she be re-instated			0
@entity150 , who runs the @entity95 , subsequently overruled that decision .			0

@entity2 , 26 , mistakenly crowned as @entity3
@entity154 was actually third runner - up in beauty pageant
lost out to real winner , @entity16 , 26 , from @entity17 , @entity18
organisers say computerised scoring results affected by *spelling* error
