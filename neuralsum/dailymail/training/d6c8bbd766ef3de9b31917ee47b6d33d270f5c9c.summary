by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 believes the attacking weapons already at his disposal will be enough come the business end of the season despite the widely held belief his @entity9 squad lacks a top level striker			2
despite being linked with a number of available stars during the transfer window - including @entity14 and @entity15 - @entity2 is preparing fans for the news that there may be no news on any further additions to his line - up before monday 's deadline			1
the imminent return of @entity24 from injury boosts the manager 's options up front after @entity2 reinforced his faith in @entity30 , whose winning header at the death against @entity33 on saturday snatched a hard - fought draw			1
‘ we have @entity57 [ @entity35 ] and [ @entity58 ] @entity56 coming back			2
let ’s not forget that			0
' out of all the names @entity2 lists though , only the @entity43 21 - year - old @entity24 joins @entity30 as a recognised striker - with the others , despite what the players themselves think , preferred in wider positions			1
@entity36 impressed in the preseason , with a four goal blitz in 22 minutes against @entity70 the pick of his performances			0
he 's anything but the finished article , but @entity2 showed signs he clearly rates the young striker by starting him in the @entity79 final against @entity80 and in their @entity82 opener against @entity83			2
front line : @entity30 is @entity2 top - choice striker , with 21 - year - old @entity24 emerging as his understudy on the attack : @entity87 's @entity54 , who 's returned from loan , can also play in a forward position threat : @entity91 forward @entity35 is also strong in the final third , though not a recognised striker as far as @entity2 is concerned , he 's better to be happy with what he has than to try and shoe - horn an expensive no 9 into his system			1
‘ all of our opponents look for strikers as well and nobody finds a world - class striker available who is better than the strikers you have , ’ he says			0
' you do n’t put a pot of players together and bring in people just to have them there			0
' it ’s not too late to play @entity111 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

gunners have been linked with @entity14 and @entity15
but @entity2 is *n't* *convinced* his side need a *big* name striker
the manager says 21 - year - old @entity24 's return from injury is significant
he adds that while not strikers as such , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity35 are attacking threats
@entity56 is also *due* to make his return from a knee injury
