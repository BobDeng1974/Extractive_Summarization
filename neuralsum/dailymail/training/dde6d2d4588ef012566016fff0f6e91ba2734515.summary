unlike traditional speed cameras , the new gantry devices , pictured , are painted grey , making them harder to spot motorists risk heavy fines following the introduction of a new generation of speed cameras on @entity10 ’s busiest motorway			1
digital technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the @entity14 in @entity15			1
it was reported last night that the devices – dubbed ‘ stealth cameras ’ by critics – have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months			1
unlike traditional yellow speed cameras , the gantry devices are painted grey , making them harder to spot for drivers			1
the same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the @entity14 and also parts of the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
front and rear - facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle ’s speed			2
and , while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time , the digital cameras can scan four			2
they are similar to cameras used during roadworks but do not work on the basis of calculating an average speed over a fixed distance			2
motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £ 100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit			1
the @entity54 recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone			1
@entity57 , one of the founder members of the @entity59 , said they did not believe targeting drivers on the motorways was the best way to improve safety and that punishing drivers for exceeding the 70mph limit was often unnecessary			1
' the 70mph limit is not a speed that a lot of people bother to observe any more , ' he said			1
' it was originally brought in as an experiment and was made permanent without any real testing			0
it was brought in at a time when the stopping power of cars was a bit like stopping an oil tanker , and the maximum speed of most cars was 74mph			2
we 've moved on now , some 50 years later we have cars that stop much more quickly			0
' the amount of traffic that exceeds the 70mph limit is enormous			2
most people are driving at 80mph on motorways , and these are our safest roads in the country			2
' mr @entity57 said he did not think using speed cameras on the @entity14 was appropriate because there are many times , particularly late at night or when there is little traffic , when it is safe to driver faster than 70mph			1
he also said these should be made more visible , rather than disguised to try and catch drivers out			1
in the two months since they have been installed on the @entity14 , pictured , almost 700 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit where the new cameras will be placed : several stretches of road are being upgraded to become ' smart motorways ' , with new speed cameras a part of improvements			1
above , a map detailing which will be affected he added : ' we seem to want to punish drivers rather than help them			1
our whole philosophy about speed cameras in this country is wrong			1
' in @entity119 , for example , if they need to slow traffic down for a particular junction or nasty bend they bit up a great big sign , miles before the camera			0
we just whack cameras up for no reason whatsoever			0
' the idea of a camera should be that you want people to see it and slow down			0
' mr @entity57 said he believed cameras only looked at a small fraction of the problem and could not test how tired people were or if they had taken drugs or been drinking			0
he said the best way to make roads safer was to increase the number of police on the roads			1
in 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009			0
ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were in operation for 24 hours a day			1
in total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £ 100 that year			0
it was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £ 2,500 to £ 10,000			0
in 2012 - 13 the government collected £ 284million in speeding fines			0
@entity155 , managing director of the @entity156 , said he was ' shocked ' officials had decided to use this type of speeding enforcement			0
he said : ' this is a another missed opportunity			0
the @entity161 is introducing so called ‘ smart motorways ’ but relying on dumb enforcement			0
it is policing by numbers , by remote control			0
' the completely ignored key to road safety is driver training			0
if drivers who had competed some advanced training ‘ earned ’ the right to drive at a higher speed on motorways , many millions would take such training , learn proper observation , anticipation and planning in their driving and accident figures would plummet			2
drivers would even be prepared to pay out of their own pockets and the benefits would affect all roads not just motorways			2
' professor @entity187 , director of the @entity188 , told @entity189 : ‘ the law is the law but it needs to be applied consistently			0
many constabularies have followed the @entity54 guidance			0
‘ if the new approach is one of zero tolerance then it needs to be equally applied across the network and understood by motorists and police forces			0
’ the @entity161 said signs warning about speed cameras should be displayed on every gantry of the motorway where they are used			1
studies have shown that nine out of ten drivers admit to breaking the motorway speed limit			1
the government had planned to raise the limit to 80mph before the proposals were shelved by transport secretary @entity211 two years ago			0
brake , the road safety group , has previously said that raising the speed limit would cause more accidents and deaths on motorways			1
the first cameras were installed between junctions five and six of the @entity14			1
@entity15 police figures showed that 668 speeding offences were logged in just over two months			1
until now , cameras have mainly been used to keep drivers below 50mph in sections of the network undergoing roadworks			2
the @entity161 , which is responsible for the nation ’s main roads , is creating so - called ‘ smart ’ motorways where the hard shoulder can be used as an additional lane to help ease heavy traffic flow at peak times			0
a spokesman said : ' variable speed limits on smart motorways are primarily there to smooth traffic flow , reduce congestion and make journeys more reliable			2
' hundreds of thousands of motorists use this stretch of the @entity14 every day			2
the vast majority are sticking to the speed limits and are experiencing better journeys as a result of smart motorways			0
' there are clear signs where cameras are in place and the new cameras are more visible than the previous versions			0

a new generation of speed cameras being introduced on the @entity14 in @entity15
they have been installed to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit
unlike traditional yellow cameras , they are painted grey and harder to spot
have already caught almost 700 motorists on the @entity14 in just two months
same technology is now set to be introduced on the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32
*association* of @entity10 drivers said they were not appropriate and were being introduced to punish drivers rather than make roads safer
