last week , the alleged victim testified that @entity14 , whom she was dating , plied her with alcohol one night in june 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room			1
the jury saw surveillance footage showing her being dragged to @entity14 's dorm room			1
deliberations : a jury will decide whether to find @entity14 , pictured left on tuesday , and @entity15 , pictured right on monday , of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery waiting game : the defense gatherers after the jury was read the charges against @entity14 and @entity15 support : @entity15 gets a hug from a friend after the jury leaves the room to begin deliberations on tuesday inside the room , @entity14 switched on porn and encouraged @entity15 and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her , prosecutors said			1
the jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the alleged sexual attack , which the men had recorded			2
@entity14 then sent some footage to friends			2
one of the men , @entity52 , allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as @entity14 said , ' squeeze that s * * * ' , the video showed			2
@entity15 then allegedly urinated on her			2
' it was n't just about sexual gratification and fun , it was about degrading her , humiliating her , ' deputy district attorney @entity56 said in his closing arguments on tuesday			2
the woman was then ' thrown in the hall like a piece of trash by the man she trusted , @entity14 , ' @entity56 said			0
' she 's not a piece of trash , ' he continued			0
' she 's a victim			0
a victim that had the courage to take that stand and face her attackers			0
a victim that had the courage to come in here and fight for justice			0
' the woman testified last week that she could not remember any of the attack			1
throughout the trial , the defense had argued that the men had become swept up in a promiscuous college culture , where people walked around naked and binged on alcohol			0
questions : on monday , @entity15 , pictured as he testified on the stand , said he blacked out from drinking so much on the night of the attack and could not remember what had happened but @entity56 said that was not the culture that was revealed during the trial			1
' the culture you really saw was entitled athletes thinking rules do n't apply to them , that 's the real culture you saw here , ' he told the court on tuesday			1
' their mindset that they could get away with anything			0
" the rules do n't apply to us "			1
' defense attorneys for the men had also argued that due to the copious amounts of alcohol they had consumed - one estimate put @entity15 's consumption at as many as 22 drinks - they were not aware of their surroundings			1
@entity15 took the stand on monday and claimed he had ' blacked out ' and did n't remember what happened that night in @entity14 's dorm room until he later saw cellphone images			1
' i was just drunk out of my mind , ' @entity15 testified			1
' this is something i would never do in my right state of mind			0
' but @entity56 dismissed the claim , pointing out that @entity15 had lucidly texted a friend to say he wanted a quesadilla - with the word correctly spelled - just 30 minutes before the alleged attack			2
he then went for a shower and made phone calls to friends before hanging out with his girlfriend			0
' attackers ' : @entity133 , left , and @entity52 , right , are also accused in the rape case regrets ? @entity133 also took the stand during his teammates ' trial and insisted he had not touched the girl ' is that a blackout ? ' @entity56 asked			0
' is that a person who does n't know what he 's doing ? is that a person who 's not acting knowingly ? ' similarly , he said that @entity14 had been drinking , yet nobody during the trial testified that he was not aware of his surroundings			1
in the aftermath of the attack , @entity14 pressured his friends to delete the graphic videos and attempted to destroy evidence on cellphones and computers , prosecutors said			1
he also emailed the victim and pressured her not to say anything negative about him , they said			0
' are those the actions of a person who is not criminally responsible ? ' @entity56 asked			0
' there 's an inference of guilt when you attempt to destroy evidence ... innocent people do n't destroy evidence			0
' but @entity14 's attorney interpreted his client 's attempts to destroy the photos a different way			1
' he at least had the sense afterwards to be upset about it , ' @entity178 told the jury			0
injuries : @entity183 , a nurse at @entity184 who carried out a rape kit on the victim , said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks , and scratches on her feet he also insisted that @entity14 had not penetrated the woman so could not be found guilty of rape			1
@entity14 had consumed too much alcohol to be able to rape her , according to earlier testimony			2
@entity178 added that there was not enough evidence that @entity14 had encouraged the other men to rape the woman			1
the jury will now have to decide whether @entity14 should be convicted of rape even though he did n't penetrate the victim , and whether @entity15 was so drunk that he could not have formed the intent to commit the crime			1
' i care what the law is , and they have n't met it , ' @entity178 said in his closing arguments			0
all four men are charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery			0
@entity14 is also charged with tampering with evidence and unlawful photography			0
all four have pleaded not guilty , including the two men not on trial : @entity133 and @entity52			2
@entity133 also testified at the trial , saying he did n't touch the woman but took pictures			2
a trial date for the two men has not yet been set .			0

*warning* : graphic details
@entity14 , 21 , and @entity15 , 21 , are on trial for raping an unconscious *student* in a dorm room in june 2013 with two other men
@entity14 ' took her back to his room after she blacked out from drinking and then encouraged the three others to sexually assault her '
she testified last week that she can remember nothing of the attack
@entity14 's attorney says his client did take photos of the attack but should not be found guilty of rape because he did not penetrate her
@entity15 's attorney said he was so drunk he did n't know what he was doing
but prosecutors said both men were in control and were ' entitled athletes who thought rules did n't apply to them '
