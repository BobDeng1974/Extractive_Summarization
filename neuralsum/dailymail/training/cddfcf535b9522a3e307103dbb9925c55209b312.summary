@entity0 and another boy walked away , climbing over the low @entity153 wall into the parking lot			1
@entity48 and @entity9 began discussing what to do with the jug of rubbing alcohol			0

@entity206 ran over to where @entity0 was in the pool , dialing 911 on a neighbor 's cell phone			1

in the background on the call @entity0 can be heard screaming in pain			1
' he 's 15 years old ... and , and his skin is peeling off , ' @entity206 told the dispatcher			0
' somebody poured stuff on him			0
' ' please help me ! ' @entity0 yelled over and over			1
