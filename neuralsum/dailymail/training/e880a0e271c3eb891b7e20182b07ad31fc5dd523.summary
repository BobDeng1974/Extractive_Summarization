the @entity0 has enraged licence fee - payers by allegedly downplaying the role of @entity4 gangs in @entity6 's sex abuse scandal			1
yesterday 's landmark report singled out @entity4 men as the main perpetrators in the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 children over 16 years - and warned council staff 's fear of acknowledging their race compounded the scandal			1
but this morning , four of @entity18 's seven articles on the report made no reference to @entity4 men			1
yesterday 's report singled out @entity4 as the main perpetrators and warned of a fear of racism blasting the @entity0 's omission as ' spineless and gutless ' , @entity30 , @entity32 's @entity31 and @entity33 , told @entity34 : ' are they worried about being racist ? ' there is no way around it : the people involved in this scandal were from the @entity4 and @entity41 communities			1
' we have to be brave			0
it 's not about racism , it 's about welfare			0
' unfortunately the people involved in this worried about being called racist			0
we have to face up to that fact and tackle this head - on in the community			0
' professor @entity51 , author of the council - commissioned report , highlighted political correctness as a key factor in the long - running scandal			1
she warned police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist			0
concerns about damage to community cohesion were put above the need to protect the vulnerable , the report said			2
readers took to social media in anger accusing the corporation of sanitising its online coverage			2
reference was made to @entity4 men in the @entity0 's evening news broadcasts and this morning 's radio			1
however , the lead articles online this morning simply referred to the perpetrators as ' criminal gangs '			2
one commenter tweeted : ' @entity0 unable to even say " @entity4 " & point fingers			2
if your name is @entity82 however , they 'll send a tv helicopter			0
another said : ' the reference to perpetrators being virtually all @entity4 has been removed from the @entity0 piece # @entity6 '			1
and one wrote : ' main @entity90 website story on # @entity6 does not mention @entity91 / @entity4 once , they are " criminal gangs " '			1
the report stated : ' the issue of race , regardless of ethic group , should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is known to be a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised abuse in any local community			2
' report : professor @entity51 warned officers had failed to speak out for fear of being seen as racist council staff were given ‘ clear directions ’ from managers to downplay the ‘ ethnic dimension ’ of the abuse despite almost all the perpetrators being of @entity4 heritage			1
three separate reports warning of the scale of the abuse were ‘ suppressed or ignored ’ by the council because it was ‘ in denial ’ about the crimes			0
despite the appalling failures in the case , no one in authority has been sacked or even disciplined			0
mps and charities said the scale of the abuse was almost ‘ incomprehensible ’ and called for a criminal investigation into those who helped cover it up			0
and at least six victims have now launched a class action against @entity6 council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation			2
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' any suggestion we ’ve sanitised our reporting is nonsense			0
' our coverage on @entity90 , including online , has made it clear that the abusers were predominately @entity91 and that council staff feared being labelled racist			1
' stories on the website are constantly evolving but all have clear links to articles which explain the full context			0
' we spoke to members of the @entity4 community in @entity6 on today , @entity149 , the @entity90 and more reaction is expected online later			1
' as the story has evolved we have covered other key developments such as the resignation of the council leader and calls for the resignation of @entity157 and we ’ll continue to explore all the different angles			0
