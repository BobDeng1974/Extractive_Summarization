by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 09:14 est , 1 august 2012 pulled : @entity1 said the video got the ' tone wrong ' , so the @entity4 took it down a government minister has been accused of ' trying to censor ' a video aimed at helping people to appeal when they have been stripped of their disability benefits			1
employment minister @entity1 interfered with the content of an official film to make it more difficult for people to overturn decisions , @entity10 claimed today			1
the video , which has since been removed , told viewers that if they appear at a hearing in person they are twice as likely to win , which mr @entity1 told officials made its ' tone wrong ' and ' negative '			1
the minister said it distracted from the issue that appeals will consider the facts of the case in front of them , not if someone has turned up			1
it also said that the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) do n't always send a representative to hearings			0
' a couple of times it 's noted that a claimant is twice as likely to win their appeal if they turn up in person – again this is broadly true , but does n't help to reduce the opinion that it is n't the facts of the case that are important , but the turning up in front of a tribunal and pleading their case , ' an email from mr @entity1 to the @entity4 said			1
after this e-mail was sent the video , presented by appeals doctor @entity52 , was taken down so its content could be considered			0
it was also removed from @entity56 for copyright reasons			0
it may be that we feel the whole tone of the video is wrong and could not be fixed , ' an email from the minister 's account later said			1
@entity73 told the @entity74 today the emails a showed mr @entity1 is ' ignoring the needs of disabled people			1
' ' many people are finding they have to appeal against wrong decisions on their disability benefits , ' he said			1
' with cuts to legal aid , it will be harder in future for them to get help			0
now @entity33 ministers are stopping people even from seeing a video that might help them , produced by the @entity4			2
' complaint : the minister said the video detracted from telling people to concentrate on the facts of their case down : the video was removed for copyright reasons and its content is still being reviewed by the @entity4 the @entity33 told @entity98 mr @entity1 never asked for the video to be pulled			1
' at no point did the @entity33 ask for the video to be taken down , ' a spokesman for the @entity33 said			0
' we raised some concerns about factual inaccuracies in the video , @entity4 officials agreed with our concerns and sought to revise the content			0
' this week it was revealed that thousands of people have been on sickness benefits for a decade or longer because they suffer from conditions including acne , bad backs and persistent coughs			2
official figures show that 885,100 have been signed off as being too sick to work and given incapacity benefit for ten years or more			2
they have a bewildering array of conditions			0
nearly 70,000 have been signed off due to bad backs while a further 140,000 have been away from the work place because of ‘ depressive episodes ’			0
ten people have been on incapacity benefit for a decade or more because of acne , while 670 have been signed off because they are obese			2
' reform of the broken incapacity benefit system is about saving lives , rather than writing people off to a life on benefits as used to happen , ' mr @entity1 said			1
‘ the reassessment of 1.5 million people on incapacity benefit and the work capability assessment we use means we can take account of conditions that change over time			2
if you can work you will get all the help and support you need to do so			0
’ he added : ‘ these figures show the scale of the problem and the ludicrous situation that used to exist and why we are right to reform the system			0

the film was made to help people appeal against benefits decisions
it said that you were twice as likely to succeed if you turned up to your hearing
emails from employment minister @entity1 show he *disliked* its ' tone ' and said it was ' negative '
after it was taken down @entity10 say it shows @entity164 is ' ignoring needs of disabled '
