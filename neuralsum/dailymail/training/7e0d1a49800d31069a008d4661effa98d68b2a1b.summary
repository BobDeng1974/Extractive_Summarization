' this was an airliner headed towards @entity7 airspace , ' the @entity15 @entity14 said on @entity19			2
' and it has the earmarks – and i 'm not concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was @entity10			2
' ' if that 's true , this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are			0
and there will be incredible repercussions if this is the case			0
' ' if it is the result of either separatist or @entity7 actions mistakenly believing that this is a @entity10 warplane , ' @entity2 warned , ' i think there 's going to be hell to pay and there should be			1
