last week @entity0 questioned the culture of golden caps and glass cabinets when @entity5 players make their 100th international appearance			1
‘ what does 100 caps mean ? ’ he asked			2
‘ did you win something ? no. ’ @entity11 did n’t win anything with @entity5 - other than the player of the year awards in 2004 and 2005 - but 106 caps is an exceptional achievement			1
it is 15 years since @entity11 made his debut , against @entity26 in october 1999			1
there were no gifts during @entity11 ’s international career			1
he earned every cap under @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
@entity11 timed his run to retirement , announcing it 48 hours before @entity35 names his first @entity5 squad since the diabolical performance at the @entity42			1
‘ @entity11 has been a superb representative of the @entity44 game , ’ said @entity35			1
‘ it is with regret that i accept and understand the decision he ’s made			0
’ beginnings : @entity11 on his @entity5 debut - against @entity26 at the @entity51 in october 1999 when he was off form or out of favour with a manager , @entity11 was n’t the type to pull a hamstring or get a doctor ’s note if he thought he was n’t going to play			1
‘ i ’m proud to get to 100 caps and to say i have done it like @entity62 because i grew up on stories of him , ’ he revealed when he was on 99 caps last september			2
on tuesday , after a final conversation with @entity5 ’s head coach , @entity11 confirmed he was stepping aside			1
he is a @entity66 player now , on loan at @entity68 until january , and his influence around the @entity5 camp would have been limited			1
‘ it has been a very tough decision			0
i have given it so much thought since the @entity42 , ’ he admitted in a statement on tuesday			0
‘ due to my club career going in a different direction it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first and also to concentrate on how i can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football			0
’ all smiles : @entity11 played under @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity82 , @entity34 and , latterly , @entity35 during his @entity5 career which spanned 15 years during the @entity42 in @entity84 he was a bystander , making his final @entity5 appearance , as captain against @entity87 , when the team had already been knocked out			2
with @entity90 also retired , at least we will never again have to suffer the debate about whether they can play in the same midfield			0
his biggest regret in an @entity5 shirt was his miss in the shoot - out against @entity98 at the 2006 @entity42			0
‘ my dad gave me a little jolt on the phone to make sure i got my head down and got through it , ’ he remembered			0
‘ you have ups and downs in your @entity5 career , but you do n’t get to 100 caps unless you get through these moments			0
’ the following season , back in the a @entity110 shirt , he was taunted by opposition supporters singing : ‘ you let your country down ’			1
the reality is that he never did			0
bad times : @entity11 reacts after missing his penalty in the shoot - out with @entity98 at the 2006 @entity42 he worked too hard , motivated throughout his career by the words of a former @entity120 team - mate when he was doing extra sets of ‘ doggies ’ after training			2
‘ what the * * * * are you doing ? ’ shouted @entity124 , getting a laugh out of the young players for saying it			0
where are they now ? @entity11 is a proud @entity44			2
he wishes the famed golden generation could have won a major tournament			0
perhaps @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity0 , @entity90 and @entity11 could have done more			2
they certainly had the talent			0
one final tournament : lampard pictured in @entity144 during the @entity145 @entity146 announces @entity5 retirement @entity11 said : ‘ it is time to move forward and i feel confident that with @entity35 in charge , the young players we have and the changes being made to the youth system , that we will have success and a team this country deserves			1
‘ i have always been exceptionally proud and honoured to represent my country i enjoyed every minute of wearing the @entity5 shirt			0
’ after wearing it for 15 years , @entity11 has earned a rest .			1
