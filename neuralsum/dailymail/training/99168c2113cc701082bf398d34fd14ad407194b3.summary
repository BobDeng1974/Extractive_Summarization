by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 20 august 2013 @entity2 : 15:20 est , 20 august 2013 @entity4 's powerful speeches have long been credited with helping to win the war , but one leading academic says there is ' little evidence ' his oratory inspired the @entity10 to beat @entity11			1
professor @entity12 also claims that the @entity15 leader 's ' finest hour ' radio address , one of his most famous , lacked impact ' because many people thought that he was drunk '			1
the @entity20 academic claims in a new book that @entity4 was not a decisive influence on the nation 's willingness to fight on against @entity25 when @entity10 was almost on its knees in 1940			1
his research also found that when @entity28 fell to the @entity29 in 1942 , one @entity30 said his rallying speech was ' f * * * * * * bull * * * * ' and a ' f * * * * * * cover - up '			1
scroll down for audio pm : after the war was won , @entity4 addresses a crowd of 20,000 at @entity39 , @entity30 , but an academic has cast doubt on the effect @entity4 's wartime speeches had on the @entity10 public in a new book @entity4 's legendary oratory , which included unforgettable phrases like ' we shall fight on the beaches ' and ' never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few ' , had moved many to join up and fight the @entity53			1
but professor @entity12 denies the traditional view that @entity4 was universally loved and said his speeches had led to criticism and controversy			1
' @entity4 's first speeches as prime minister in the dark days of 1940 were by no means universally acclaimed , ' he said			2
' many people thought that he was drunk during his famous " finest hour " broadcast and there is little evidence that they made a decisive difference to the @entity10 people 's will to fight on			1
' well - qualified : @entity68 academic @entity12 , who is an expert on @entity4 , looks in detail at how people reacted to his speeches in his book , @entity73 prof @entity12 's new book - the @entity74 - examines government documents and surveys , as well as the diaries of ordinary people			1
he used both the home intelligence reports and the mass observational archives to analyse what people thought of @entity4 's speeches at the time and separate that reaction from what people later remembered or thought they remembered their reactions to be			1
and he admitted that even he was surprised by the results			2
he said : ' i thought the established story was completely true i simply thought one had to check it out and find confirmatory evidence for it , i even thought it might be rather dull			2
' but when i actually started analysing the records i realised that i was n't finding the established story that i was expecting			1
' i 'm not saying @entity4 's speeches were bad speeches but people often got depressed by them and that is perfectly understandable because they were often conveying very sobering messages			1
' in july and august 1940 we do genuinely find people being excited by his speeches but this feeling then gets projected throughout the whole period and it 's actually much more complicated than that			1
' i would argue that by the summer of 1940 moral had actually improved on account of the @entity10 action in @entity107 and that bucked everybody up			1
' that fact that moral had gone up improved the reception which @entity4 's speeches got rather than his speeches improving moral			2
' the material i used has all be around but no - one has ever looked at it for these purposes before - to systematically analyse the public response to @entity4 's speeches			2
' one of the most vivid accounts was written by a journalist who had joined the @entity121 and had written down in shorthand the comments of his friend @entity123 , a 24 - year - old @entity125 polisher from south @entity30			1
hero : sir @entity4 is regarded by many as the man who saved @entity10 from the clutches of @entity25 's @entity11 as @entity123 listened to @entity4 's speech on the fall of @entity28 in february 1942 , he reportedly said : ' f * * * * * * bulls * * *			1
what a f * * * * * * cover - up			1
any normal person could see it 's just pulling the wool over their eyes			2
' prof @entity12 , who works in the @entity141 at the @entity20 , said : ' there was a complexity to people 's reactions to @entity4 's speeches at the time , as the evidence shows that they may have liked one bit of a speech and not another section , or liked some speeches but not others			1
' people sometimes changed their minds following discussions with friends or after reading newspaper commentaries			2
' there was not a blanket acceptance and positive reaction			0
a more measured response to his speeches is in evidence			0
this is possibly why the speeches did n't always have the effect now credited to them			2
' prof @entity12 said @entity4 's famous ' we shall fight them on the beaches ' speech of june 1940 was to the @entity174 , and never broadcast , but people convinced themselves they heard it			1
' it was never broadcast , though it was reported on the @entity178 by an announcer and quoted in the press , ' he said			0
' however , people claim to remember having heard this famous speech from june 1940 , even though they had n't			1
' it was recorded for posterity along with others of his wartime speeches nine years later			0
' mr @entity12 has some academic pedigree , after a phd from @entity188 , his book @entity123 and @entity4 : rivals for @entity191 , won him awards , including @entity193 in 2007			1
three years later he wrote the book : @entity4 's @entity195 : @entity196 that made him and the @entity197			0
may 13 1940 in his first address as prime minister : ' i would say to the @entity174 , as i said to those who have joined the government : " i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat			2
" ' we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind			0
we have before us many , many long months of struggle and of suffering			0
you ask , what is our policy ? ' i will say : it is to wage war , by sea , land and air , with all our might and with all the strength that @entity222 can give us ; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny , never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime			0
' that is our policy			0
you ask , what is our aim ? i can answer in one word : victory ; victory at all costs , victory in spite of all terror , victory , however long and hard the road may be ; for without victory , there is no survival			0
' june 4 1940 following the evacuation of forces from @entity244 : ' we shall not flag or fail			0
we shall go on to the end			0
we shall fight in @entity125 , we shall fight on the seas and oceans , we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air			2
' we shall defend our island , whatever the cost may be			0
we shall fight on the beaches , we shall fight on the landing - grounds , we shall fight in the fields and in the streets , we shall fight in the @entity258 shall never surrender ! ' june 18 1940 following the collapse of @entity125 to @entity11 forces : ' upon this battle depends the survival of @entity264 civilisation			1
upon it depends our own @entity10 life , and the long continuity of our institutions and our @entity195			1
' the whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us			0
@entity25 knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war			0
if we can stand up to him , all @entity273 may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad , sunlit uplands			0
' but if we fail , then the whole world , including the @entity278 , including all that we have known and cared for , will sink into the abyss of a new @entity280 made more sinister , and perhaps more protracted , by the lights of perverted science			0
' let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves that if the @entity285 and its @entity286 last for a thousand years , men will still say , " this was their @entity288			0
" ' august 20 1940 in tribute to the @entity291 : ' the gratitude of every home in our island , in our @entity195 , and indeed throughout the world , except in the abodes of the guilty , goes out to the @entity10 airmen who , undaunted by odds , unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger , are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion			1
' never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few			0
' september 9 1941 on @entity10 's increasing strength in battle : ' the mood of @entity10 is wisely and rightly averse from every form of shallow or premature exultation			1
' this is no time for boasts or glowing prophecies , but there is thisâ € ” a year ago our position looked forlorn , and well nigh desperate , to all eyes but our own			2
today we may say aloud before an awe - struck world , " we are still masters of our fate			0
we still are captain of our souls			0
" ' november 10 1942 following the victory at @entity323 , @entity107 : ' the @entity324 have received back again that measure of fire and steel which they have so often meted out to others			2
now this is not the end			0
' it is not even the beginning of the end			0
but it is , perhaps , the end of the beginning			0

professor @entity12 says his oratory did n't inspire all of @entity10 to fight
@entity341 looked at government documents , surveys and @entity10 ' diaries
@entity123 , 24 , in 1942 called his speech on fall of @entity28 ' f * * * * * * bulls * * * '
@entity12 says people *falsely* remembered ' fight them on the beaches ' speech
