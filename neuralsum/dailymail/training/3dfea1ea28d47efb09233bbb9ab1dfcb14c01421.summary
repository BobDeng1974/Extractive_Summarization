the appeal was filed with the 1st @entity9 @entity10 hours after @entity9 district court judge @entity11 denied the change - of - venue request and a motion seeking a nine - month delay in the start of the trial			1
the defense is now asking @entity11 to postpone jury selection , scheduled to begin monday , pending the outcome of the appeal			2

he could face the death penalty if convicted			1
denied : @entity2 bombing suspect @entity1 was denied a change of venue for his upcoming trial in @entity28 the defense lawyers , in their appeal to the higher court , again argued @entity1 could n't receive a fair trial in the @entity28 federal courthouse a couple of miles from where the bombing occurred			1
prosecutors , they said , were likely to depict the crimes as having affected not only those killed and injured but nearly the entire greater @entity28 community			0
' thus , every member of the jury pool is , in effect , an actual victim of the charged offenses , ' the defense attorneys wrote			0
as an alternative to ordering the trial moved , the lawyers suggested the appeals court order @entity11 to hold a hearing on " disputed issues of fact " and reconsider the previous change - of - venue motions			1
@entity11 said in his ruling earlier wednesday he would provide a detailed explanation for it later			0
in rejecting @entity1 's first request in september to move the trial , @entity11 said defense lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point an impartial jury could n't be chosen in @entity28			1
the defense has compared the coverage to that in the case of @entity69 bomber @entity68 , whose trial was moved to @entity71			0
@entity68 was convicted and put to death for the bombing , which killed 168 people			0
in wednesday 's appeals court filing , @entity1 's lawyers noted @entity77 recently named the aftermath of the marathon bombing the top @entity81 news story of 2014 and gov. - elect @entity82 , in response to a question posed by the @entity85 in october , said @entity1 was the living person he despised the most			1

" the ban includes law enforcement uniforms and badges , except for those worn by on - duty @entity9 marshals or court security officers			2
defense lawyers said in motions seeking a trial delay the prosecution has not handed over everything they have requested , including information they believe may show @entity1 was under his brother 's influence			2
the defense also wanted more time to review information regarding @entity127 , who recently pleaded guilty to having possessed the gun prosecutors said the bombing suspects used to kill a @entity131 police officer			0
in a court filing opposing the request for a delay , prosecutors rejected complaints by @entity1 's lawyers about their ability to digest the volume of material provided by the government			2
prosecutors said much of that information was demanded by the defense and voluntarily turned over by the government ' in the spirit of openness			0
