pictured above in court on tuesday jurors were shown pictures of @entity15 ( right ) for the first time on thursday but @entity10 ' attorneys told the jury that the searches were evidence that @entity10 loved her child , and wanted to know what was wrong with him			1
they also pointed to a text message @entity10 sent right after her son died , on january 25 , which read : ' i love him ! ! ! he 's my entire world , my soul ! ! ! ! ! i lived for him ! ! ! ' they said @entity10 was so torn up about the loss of her son , that she googled different ways to commit suicide including by overdose of sleeping pills and self - injecting insulin			1
thursday 's court session also marked the first time that jurors were shown pictures of little @entity15 , showing the blonde - haired blue - eyed boy looking healthy , eating and painting , just two weeks before his death			1
the most recent picture shown of the boy to the court was taken on january 25 , 2014 in the hospital with his eyes closed and jaw slack			2

defense lawyer @entity96 told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27 - year - old @entity92 poisoned her son			1
he added : ' there is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question " why ? '' @entity10 's attorneys said in court on thursday that text message conversations prove she was a loving and caring mother who did n't poison her own son			1
pictured in court on tuesday @entity96 also appeared to blame the hospital , in the @entity12 suburbs near the @entity114 ' @entity11 home , noting it was only there that a high sodium level was detected			0

' the @entity120 lived in @entity11 at the time of @entity15 's death			0

@entity15 's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and a blog			2
many of the postings will be used in evidence , along with @entity10 ' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from @entity12 , @entity140 and @entity10 ' native @entity141			0
also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt â€” and which they say she tried to hide after @entity15 's death			0
defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of @entity152 by proxy , a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy			0
some experts believe that disorder fits @entity92 ' actions .			0
