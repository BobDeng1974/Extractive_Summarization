fans desperate for pictures with the @entity3 cyclists are creating danger for riders by trying to take ' selfies ' as they race past at 37mph			1
competitors have warned that spectators could get seriously hurt if they step into the road when they have their backs to the fast - moving peloton			2
@entity13 branded the craze ‘ a dangerous mix of vanity and stupidity ’ and appeared to be complaining on @entity18 on sunday night that he suffered a knee injury after a collision with a spectator			1
while some spectators ( such as this man pictured ) made sure there was a clear distance between them and competitors , others were not so careful while riders have said they appreciate the support , they have said that creeping nearer to the road to get a better shot is endangering both them and fans			1
the spectator pictured above keeps a safe distance from the riders			1
