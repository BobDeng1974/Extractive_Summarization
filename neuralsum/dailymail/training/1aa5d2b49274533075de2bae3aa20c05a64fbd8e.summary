a short while later , as the teenager chatted to her friends and prom date while swaying to the music , she said she noticed a group of fathers staring at her from a balcony			2

@entity13 's date also tried to explain that because the group had arrived together , if she was made to leave they would all have to go			1

as she was being escorted , crying , from the venue , @entity13 says she asked the security guard what he made of the situation			2
' i asked the security guy if my dress was compliant with the dress code and if he had noticed any inappropriateness in my behavior and he said he did n’t think i did anything to get kicked out but it was n’t his call , ' @entity13 wrote			1
support : @entity13 's prom date , pictured , and her friends , who drove to the dance together , are demanding a refund after having to leave early ' we walked out of the prom , frustrated and angry and feeling very disrespected and violated , ' @entity13 said , admitting that in a moment of immaturity they had shouted profanities			1
@entity13 added that she felt singled out for her appearance , and is demanding that the @entity134 organizers refund her friends who were forced to leave alongside her			1

' my group of five people had to leave the prom because i stuck out , i have long legs and i was wearing a sparkly dress , i did n’t look like most of the 13 - 15 year old girls there			1
' the experience has left the teenager feeling frustrated and angry at being singled out for her appearance			0
' i was talked to disrespectfully , ganged up on and treated as less then a person by people in authority , and when i requested to have one of my peers present to validate later what was said in this " meeting " i was denied that right , ' she said			0
big night : the prom for home school students was being held at the @entity160 in @entity1 ' i felt violated by the sheer number of male parents that were assigned to do nothing for five hours other then watch girls in short dresses and heels dance to upbeat music , ' @entity13 added			1
' i think that it is sick and wrong that they assigned them to sit on a balcony above us and look down on us and single us out for our clothes or dancing			0
' friends of the teenager told her later that as the evening went on , other students were dancing proactively , yet no one intervened to stop them			2
' i ’m only 17 , but i can see there ’s something wrong about this ... please tell me i ’m not the only one who think it does n’t matter how people are dressed or how they move their bodies , we should still treat them with respect and decency			0
' the teenager said she wants answers from the organizers about the way she feels she was treated			0
' [ is ] @entity134 adult enough to own up to their wrong actions as well			0
and refund my group as they verbally promised to do , and issue an apology for kicking me out of my senior prom because their husbands felt as though my body was something they had a right to control , ' she said			0
organizers for the @entity134 have not yet responded to a @entity208 request for comment			0
