world number one @entity2 interrupted proceedings between games , getting the crowd to slow - clap him as he removed his top , swinging it above his head and flexing his muscles			1
and his ambitious young contender duly hit back with a fine return , stripping and throwing his top into the crowd			1
@entity12 , the 22 - year - old boyfriend of @entity27 , is fast becoming better known for his looks than his ability with a racket , making headlines for showing off his body during a previous match just three days ago			1
the brief moment of light entertainment came during a match at the @entity38 tennis competition in @entity6 yesterday afternoon			1
after @entity2 , 26 , beat his opponent 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 10 - 6 , he proceeded to taunt him by making fun of his girlfriend			1
prompted to treat the crowd with his notorious impression of @entity27 , @entity2 shouted out : ' i have n't done my @entity27 impression for a while now , but i think @entity12 is probably better at it than me now			1
' @entity12 took the goading well and agreed to compare @entity27 acts for the crowd , saying : ' i 'll do the walking ' as @entity2 replied : ' i 'll do the serve			1
' @entity52 , who stands at 6ft 2in tall and is ranked 31st in the world , proceeded to skip and storm across the field with his head down , causing fans to erupt into cheers and laughter			2
making a point : the @entity61 sits down and challenges his young opponent @entity12 to follow suit yesterday but the larger applause came for @entity2 , who pranced around the court before sticking out his bottom and pretending to tuck long hair behind his ears , steadying himself to serve			2
he then threw the ball in the air and hit it , grunting like a wild animal			2
' it was one of the funniest things i 've ever seen in a sports match , ' said @entity77 , 30 , who was in the audience			2
' he is such an entertainer			0
he was flicking his hair and grunting really loudly			0
it was like when @entity81			0
@entity12 took it well and joined in			0
i 'd love to know what @entity27 thought			0
' earlier @entity2 removed his top before pointing dramatically to his opponent so he could do the same			1
oh i say : the crowd are loving it as @entity12 dares to bare ( left ) , before the @entity90 's strip is complete ( right ) the fan added : ' the crowd went wild			2
it was full of middle class women - the @entity96 brigade - but they loved it and got out their cameras to take pictures			0
' it was one of the funniest things i 've ever seen in a sports match ' @entity77 , 30 , crowd member ' at first @entity12 would n't take his top off because he did n't have another one with him			1
but a ball girl got him one and he took his other one off and threw it into the crowd			0
' @entity2 also performed an impression of a ball girl for the crowd before having a rally with a five - year - old on a neighbouring court			1
the world 's top player has form for stripping for the crowd			1

@entity12 , meanwhile , has been proudly showing off his gorgeous @entity124 girlfriend			0

' i have n't done my @entity27 impression for a while now , but i think @entity12 is probably better at it than me now ' @entity2 after yesterday 's match , @entity2 said : ' everything is going according to plan and hopefully i can get in the best possible shape for the start of @entity15			1
' there 's no bigger motivation than playing in the most prestigious tournament in the world in our sport , the one that i always dreamed of winning			0
