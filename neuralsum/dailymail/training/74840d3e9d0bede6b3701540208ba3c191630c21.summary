the @entity9 wants ' assurances that @entity3 is countering improvised explosive devices in their country that are targeting our coalition forces ' , @entity87 , a @entity89 @entity88 , said			1
some $ 20billion of security and economic aid has been allocated to @entity3 by the @entity9 since the start of the war in @entity28 in 2001 - much of it in the form of reimbursements for assistance in fighting militants			1
but @entity9 politicians have expressed increasing frustration with @entity3 's efforts in the war			2
there have been proposals to make @entity9 aid to @entity3 conditional on more cooperation in fighting militants such as the @entity20 - linked @entity112 , which @entity113 believes operates out of @entity3			2
cause for complaint ? as the @entity9 stepped up its attacks on @entity82 insurgents , the numbers of civilian deaths have increased in @entity3 , particularly after strikes by drones 2001 - @entity3 becomes an ally in the war against terror after the september 11 attacks 2009 - @entity9 launches strategy to destroy @entity20 holdouts in @entity3 and prevent insurgents crossing the border into @entity28			1

@entity3 strongly denies the comments december , 2011 - @entity1 freezes $ 700million in aid over @entity3 's failure to prevent spread of homemade explosives into @entity28 @entity3 says it is doing all it can to fight @entity20 and the @entity82 and has lost thousands of soldiers since it joined the @entity9 led war 10 years ago , some at the hands of coalition troops			1
@entity170 has accused @entity171 of deliberately killing 24 @entity3 soldiers in an air strike near the @entity28 border last month and shut down supplies for foreign troops in anger			1
former general and security analyst @entity178 said : ' i think the @entity3 side will understand the type of signal that is coming , which shows it 's not only a question of aid			0
' the whole attitude of the @entity9 and the relationship will be affected by these measures because they know @entity3 will not be in a position to control smuggling			2
' @entity88 senator @entity69 said last week : ' the vast majority of the material used to make ieds used against @entity9 forces in @entity28 originates from two fertiliser factories inside @entity3			1
' a @entity198 report in october said the @entity3 factories , owned by one of the country 's biggest companies , @entity201 , have been producing over 300,000 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate per year since 2004			0
the @entity9 has urged @entity3 to strictly regulate the distribution of ammonium nitrate to @entity28			1
so far , @entity3 has only produced draft legislation on the issue			0
analysts say @entity9 demands will be tough to meet because of rampant corruption on both sides of the porous border that makes smuggling easy			0

" we pay a 1,200 - rupee ( $ 13 ) bribe to the @entity222 on the border for every car carrying fertiliser , " said @entity216 in the border town of @entity218			0
" @entity226 is smuggled on trucks , pickup trucks , motorcycles , bicycles and donkey carts			0
' @entity3 's fragile economy is heavily dependent on agriculture , so cutting down on fertiliser output would hurt the sector			0

it is part of compromise legislation authorising @entity9 defence programmes expected to be approved this week , mr @entity87 said			0
