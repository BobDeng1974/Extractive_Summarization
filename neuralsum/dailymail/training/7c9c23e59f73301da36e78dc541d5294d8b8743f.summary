by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will not order @entity3 to end his media commitments but is convinced the centre - half will focus squarely on @entity6 for the next 12 months			1
@entity2 believes 35 - year - old @entity3 , who won six @entity8 titles , is motivated by a desire to prove he can still perform at the top after losing his place at @entity12			1
' what we ’re paying him here is n’t going to change his life , ' said the @entity6 boss			1
' he can walk away , do anything he wants			0
he ’s on the @entity19 at the @entity20 , up there with @entity22 and @entity23 at the @entity25 final , the day they had to go bosh and pick the top three pundits			1
i would n’t want to him on tv at 5.30 on a saturday night , after coming off 10 minutes from the end			0
' there was a player a few years ago who kept turning up on the radio on “ 606 ” and i thought : " how on earth has he got there ? " ' @entity3 rejected moves to @entity53 and @entity38 and mind - bogglingly lucrative offers to play abroad			1
he started life at @entity6 with a double training session on friday			1
he impressed as a @entity25 pundit at the @entity20 and will continue to work as an ambassador for @entity60 but @entity2 insisted : ' @entity61 is going to concentrate on his football			1
' he ’s a focused boy			0
he ’s got other business interests but he wo n’t come here unless he ’s sure			0
why mug yourself off when you ’ve been a top player ? why put yourself under that pressure for a few quid ? ' he ’s not stupid			0
he ’s doing it because he believes he can still play at the top level			2
he wants to come here and play football			2
otherwise he would have walked away to be an ambassador in @entity74 or earn a fortune in @entity76			0
he said : " no , i want to play football			2
" he ’s here to play			0
' @entity2 has earned a reputation in his career for squeezing a few more years from high - calibre footballers , including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
' you will always get doubters and people who say he ’s finished , ' said the @entity6 boss			1
' i back my own judgement and opinion			0
everybody said @entity84 was finished when i took him and he was as good as any centre - half in the @entity8			0
' @entity61 did n’t need convincing			2
he wanted to come to @entity6			2
he spoke to two top @entity31 clubs , but he wanted to come here and to play			2
he could have gone elsewhere and maybe not played at times			0
' new chapter : @entity3 posted an image on his @entity101 account after signing farewell : @entity3 left @entity12 after 12 years of success at @entity103 @entity104 : @entity31 , nov 7 1978 ( age 35 ) 1996 - 2000 : @entity38 ( 127 apps , 2 gls ) 1996 - 1997 : @entity109 ( loan ) ( 10 , 0 ) 2000 - 2002 : @entity110 ( 54 , 2 ) 2002 - 2014 : @entity12 ( 312 , 7 ) 2014 - now : @entity6 there was also a glowing reference from @entity113 , who confirmed @entity3 was in good physical shape , despite only started 21 games for @entity12 last season , and theories that he was not able to play twice in a week			1
@entity2 said : ' i spoke to @entity113 , not that i had doubts , just to ask how much training @entity61 did and @entity113 said if he had still had been his manager this year then he would have been his @entity122 centre - half			1
when he took over last year the first thing he did was put @entity61 back in the team			1
' he was fit all year , but @entity125 ( @entity126 ) came in and wanted to change the team around			0
he did n’t pick him			0
we got his records from @entity12 and he was the fourth or fifth highest player , in terms of being available for training and playing			2
' @entity3 will not have to wait long to go back to @entity103			1
@entity6 are due there on september 14			2
@entity2 was manager at @entity38 when he first saw @entity3 and pipped @entity131 to sign the schoolboy			1
old : @entity3 started his senior career at @entity38 in 1996 before going to @entity110 in 2000 ' he came and played in our youth team and from @entity136 i knew , ' said the @entity6 boss			1
' when he was 16 , i said he would be the best defender in @entity139 one day and he was			0
i was n’t a bad judge really			0
' i was away with the first - team at @entity142 one day when the youth team had @entity144 and my @entity145 went to watch and said he ’d seen the best kid he ’d seen in years			0
' i went through about seven of our kids and he kept saying no. then he said @entity3			2
i said " nah , he could n’t have played @entity145 , he is still a schoolboy			0
" it was a @entity150 final			0
' i was at the first game , when we lost - we got beat something like 4 - 2 - and then we won the second leg at @entity155 and we won the cup on aggregate			0
' when i spoke to our youth team manager @entity158 and asked if @entity3 had played he said he ’d never seen anything like it			2
' @entity2 expects @entity3 to bring a positive influence to @entity163 on and off the pitch , and the first of those may be to convince @entity167 to sign			1
@entity168 have accepted a bid from @entity6 for @entity167 but @entity170 are also interested			1
' he would like to play with @entity61 , ' said @entity2			1
' he feels if he plays with @entity61 it would help him get back on track with the @entity173 team , which i think he is capable of doing			1
it ’s still not done			0
we agreed a fee a couple of weeks back			1
' he did not deny interest in @entity182 pair @entity181 and @entity183 , and wants to sign @entity184 from @entity185 but admitted it was ' dragging on a bit '			0
@entity189 wants to leave for @entity191 football , @entity188 is keen to return to @entity192 where he spent last season on loan , and the @entity6 boss would like to recruit more players but he is wary not to repeat the same mistakes the club made when they were last promoted to the top flight and loaded the squad with players of questionable quality on bloated contracts			1
' we are determined not to make those mistakes again , ' said @entity2			2
' i think ( chairman ) @entity206 ( @entity208 ) and the board have learned from that so we have got to make sure this time as best we can we make the right decisions and get the right characters in here			0
' we do n’t want people who are going to come here just for the money and not be interested in the club			0
we want people genuinely want to come here and play and do well for us			0
