@entity0 believes @entity1 " will suffer " if he decides to play in the @entity2 at @entity3 , which gets under way on thursday			1
@entity1 is a major doubt for the final major of the year after withdrawing from the @entity7 during sunday 's final round at @entity9			1
the former world no 1 looked in severe pain from his back after hitting his tee shot on the ninth hole in just his third tournament since undergoing back surgery on march 31			2
@entity0 also postponed a press conference in favour of more practice , but told @entity30 : ' i saw the tv pictures on sunday evening and really , how can he can play again this year , never mind within three days ? ' whether he can handle this i 'm not sure			1
this is a big golf course , the rough is heavy again			0
he 's hitting the ball i hate to say , not straight , he will be in the rough and he will suffer			0
' whether it 's good for his long term future in the game to play here or not i am not sure			2
obviously we would love him to play , it 's a bigger and better event when he does			0
' rough deal : @entity0 thinks @entity1 will suffer if he tries to play at @entity3 @entity45 highlights @entity0 has not played in the @entity23 @entity2 since 2010 and made the cut just twice in his last nine appearances , but qualified courtesy of winning his first of two senior major titles this season , the @entity51 in may			1
and the former @entity53 captain believes @entity1 will have to be honest with himself and @entity23 captain @entity54 if @entity54 considers him for one of his three wild cards for @entity57			1
' it would be very difficult to say if @entity1 was fit , not to pick him , ' @entity0 added			1
' can @entity54 go to @entity57 and , the horrible thing is , lose having left @entity1 here ? ' he has more of an excuse now because @entity1 might not be fit for five rounds in three days			2
he has to take players who can play five rounds in three days			0
can he play that ? right now the answer is no. watchful eye : former @entity53 captain @entity0 is now a regular on the senior circuit ' @entity1 has to sit down and be very , very honest with @entity54 and say ' am i going to help you ? can i win three and a half out of five points ? '			1
if he can say that obviously you take him			0
if he 's honest , right now , it 's no , but he 's got this week to prove himself			0
' @entity1 has up until just before his tee time of 8:35am on thursday to decide whether to play or miss three of the year 's four majors for the first time in his career			2
knee surgery in 2008 to replace his anterior cruciate ligament - just after his last major victory in the @entity80 at @entity81 - forced him to miss the @entity80 and @entity2			0
in 2011 he failed to tee it up at the @entity80 and the @entity83 because of an @entity85 complaint .			0

@entity1 a major doubt for the @entity23 @entity89 starting in @entity3 this week
former world no 1 was in obvious *discomfort* at @entity9 last week
