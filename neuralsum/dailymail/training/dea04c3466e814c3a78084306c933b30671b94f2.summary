i am covered top - to - toe in a gloopy mess of tomato juice and mud			1
pieces of tomato and tomato skin are stuck to my skin			0
there are infinite pips in my hair , ears , and various other crevices			0
i have just taken part in a @entity15 - style fight in the far corner of the @entity18 site			1
this is where only the bravest of the brave venture , knowing that they will come out smothered - to face either ridiculous queues for a shower , or a day - long baby wipe session , afterwards			1
yet i am laughing joyously like a child in a sandpit , safe in the knowledge that i will be heading back to my very own bathroom and incredibly comfortable double bed			0
mayhem : @entity32 enjoyed a session of mud and mess in @entity15 - style tomato battle in the red : the tomato fight took no prisoners - everyone was left splattered and battered by fruit in fact , in an ultimate act of smug rebellion , on arrival back at @entity45 , the newest and closest pop - up hotel to the famous festival site , i decide to do a mud slide and get as dirty as possible			1
the luxury of a fully - functioning private bathroom and plush bed is just one awesome perk that comes with staying in a @entity54 at @entity18			1
the pop - up consists of around 30 adjoining compact rooms			1
they each feature everything you might need for a stress - free stay , including wifi , @entity63 , air conditioning and heating , en - suite wet - room with hot shower , personal safe , power sockets , fresh towels and sheets daily ( thanks to a turn - down service ) , and complimentary toiletries			1
outside , a paved pathway leads to a greenhouse - marquee structure that they call the ' social area ' - basically a reception / breakfast room with tables , chairs and sofas perfect for catching up with everyone			2
there , you will find at least one or two chirpy and helpful staff , seemingly at any hour			0
a shelter from the storm : @entity88 offers comfy accommodation for non-camping festival - goers comfy : snoozebox suites have wet - rooms with hot showers , and come with fresh towels and sheets every day aside from providing great company , the @entity88 team serve a hot breakfast each morning , ferry guests to and from the festival site in a swanky @entity102 at a phone call 's notice , and are always on hand with any hot or cold snacks , booze or soft drinks that anyone requires – including prosecco and delicious @entity112 coconut mylks ( perfect for a hangover )			1
it is all included in the package			0
it should be , too			0
those staying at @entity45 for the full five days of the festival will be investing almost £ 2,000 for the privilege - but will save a considerable amount on food and drink ( especially alcohol )			1
the festival ticket is not included			2
i embrace the haven fully			0
each day , i get up for breakfast , head out to the festival at around midday , head back to @entity54 for a rest , snack and pre-drinks at around 5 or 6 - and dash back out to see some awesome music and creative arts at about 8 or 9			1
even if you miss the 1.30am shuttle curfew , a cab back to the hotel is around £ 6 , or a 15 - 20 minute walk up the road			2
it is worth bearing in mind that the site for the pop - up is based just outside the north - east corner of the ( absolutely massive ) festival site			1
so allow yourself a good hour to get from a to @entity148 the distance strikes a fine balance between not - too - far - to - get - to and far - enough - away - for - some - genuine - privacy - and - peace			2
this makes it ideal for festival fans , artists and music professionals alike			1
every now and again , somewhat surreally , i spot a face at breakfast who i will be watching on the pyramid stage later that day			0
hop in : @entity88 staff ferry clients to and from the festival site in a swanky @entity102 at a phone call 's notice furthermore , it seems that extensive walking is , in general , a done - thing at @entity18 , wherever you may be residing			1
the size of the site is immense - and it needs to be to cater for the prolific and diverse stalls and entertainment on offer			2
there is an abundance of experiences , aside from some of the finest music acts in the world			2
you can easily ignore the bands entirely , but still have an awesome time			0
but in five days , it is impossible to explore the whole place , or see and enjoy everything fully - which is bittersweet			1
there is a circus , plus comedy and cabaret tents - where you find acrobats , jokers and dancers			2
children 's tents provide fun and games for the little ones , and you find hippies strumming guitars and embracing environmental issues at the @entity205 and @entity206 areas			0
a festival for all : alternative entertainment includes circus , comedy , cabaret and children 's tents suitably refreshed : @entity32 heads off to the festival site after another rest at @entity45 while @entity216 totally outdo themselves with a faultless headline set of back - to - back anthems , complete with a @entity220 cameo , i end up falling equally head - over - heels for an altogether more surreal area - the dark and very adult south - east corner			1
@entity224 - or , more specifically , its sub-section @entity225 - is an installation staffed entirely by method actors			2
@entity229 - haired bouncers at a metal club called @entity231 will only let you in if you know the best guitar amp to buy			2
elsewhere , there are inked - up goths manning a dive called @entity237 - who will only allow you access if , you guessed it , you flash them a tattoo			0
the best club is a place called the @entity243 , where a woman at front desk will ask if you have an appointment , before letting you in			0
the dj is dressed like @entity248 from the it crowd doing paperwork between tracks			0
' staff ' and ravers alike pass files and folders back and forth , and every now and again the ' fire alarm ' will go off , and everyone will be ' evacuated '			0
@entity259 's magic : festival - goers have to flash ink for access to certain areas of @entity225 club classic : at the @entity243 , staff and ravers pass around files and folders as the fire alarm goes off great fun - but is is lovely to come home to cosy comfort after such a mad night			1
despite the genuine pilgrimage of the walk it takes to get there , i end up making the journey three or four times , happy that i am burning off all those calories from the insanely delicious ( though pricey - £ 7 for a chicken wrap , for example ) festival food on offer			1
in letting you take time out from the festival site in the morning and evening , @entity54 allows you to experience more , not less , of @entity18			0
the combination of hot food , comfortable rest , companionship and camaraderie recharges batteries to the point that you can keep going till 6 or 7am each night - all the way to sunday			0
if you can stomach the price , there is no longer any reason to camp			0
