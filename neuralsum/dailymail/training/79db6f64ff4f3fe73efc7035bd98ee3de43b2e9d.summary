the deadly ebola virus could spread across the world infecting people from the @entity4 to @entity5 within three weeks , scientists have warned			1
there is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the @entity12 by october 24 , a team of @entity4 researchers have predicted			1
using @entity15 spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world			1
they estimate there is a 75 per cent chance @entity15 will reach @entity23 shores by october 24			1
and @entity24 has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory , while @entity28 and @entity29 have lower risks of 14 per cent each			1
the virus is spreading rapidly across @entity32 , with more than 3,400 people known to have died and 7,500 infected			1
volunteers in @entity55 , @entity56 are pictured carrying a man , suspected of having the virus , to a health centre in the capital the numbers are based on air travel remaining at full capacity , and are being constantly updated by the researchers , who last reviewed the figures based on data from october 1			2
but assuming there is an 80 per cent reduction in travel to reflect that many airlines are halting flights to affected regions , the scientists predict @entity23 's risk is still 25 per cent , and the @entity12 's is 15 per cent			1
but the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity78 , said the risks change every day the epidemic continues			2
professor @entity81 of @entity37 in @entity38 , who led the research , said : ' this is not a deterministic list , it 's about probabilities â€“ but those probabilities are growing for everyone			0
' it 's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky			0
' air traffic is the driver			0
' but there are also differences in connections with the affected countries ( @entity99 , @entity56 and @entity100 ) , as well as different numbers of cases in these three countries - so depending on that , the probability numbers change			0
' dr @entity106 , of @entity107 , an expert in viruses who has been tracking the epidemic , said : ' it 's really a lottery			0
' if this thing continues to rage on in @entity32 and indeed gets worse , as some people have predicted , then it 's only a matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to @entity120			1
' @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity4 - where the first case was diagnosed on tuesday - have all seen people carrying the haemorrhagic fever virus , apparently unwittingly , arrive on their shores			1
experts warn the virus could also reach @entity24 , @entity28 and @entity29 within the next three weeks @entity23 is among the countries deemed most likely to be hit next , because the worst affected countries include @entity99 , a @entity23 - speaking country with busy travel links back			1
@entity12 lies dangerously in the path of the virus , due to @entity135 's status as one of the world 's biggest travel hubs , with frequent links to @entity121			1
the researchers at @entity37 , in @entity38 , calculated the countries most at risk in the short term , are : @entity23 and @entity12 have each treated one national who was brought home with the disease and then cured			1
the scientists ' study suggests that more may bring it to @entity120 not knowing they are infected			2
the @entity150 has not placed any restrictions on air travel and has encouraged airlines to keep flying to the worst - hit countries			0
@entity155 and @entity156 have suspended some flights but other airlines continue to fly to the region			0
patients diagnosed with @entity15 , which is transmitted via bodily fluids , are most contagious when they reach the terminal stage			2
in its final attack on the body , the virus causes both internal and external bleeding , profuse vomiting and diarrhoea , all of which can contain high concentrations of the infectious virus			2
there is still a high risk of the virus being passed on in earlier stages , especially since people may not know they are infected , with symptoms taking between two and 21 days to emerge			1
it is therefore feared a sufferer could travel to @entity12 without knowing they had the disease and infect others			1
last week @entity184 became the first patient to fly into @entity4 without knowing he had @entity15 and 114 people came into contact with him before he was diagnosed			1
study author and expert in viruses who has been tracking the epidemic , dr @entity106 , of @entity107 , said : ' it 's really a lottery			0
' volunteers are pictured pushing a cart through the streets of @entity55 , @entity56 , carrying a suspected victim of the deadly virus to a local health centre @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity4 - where the first case was diagnosed on tuesday - have all seen people carrying the haemorrhagic fever virus , apparently unwittingly , arrive on their shores			1
a man suspected of having @entity15 waits to be admitted to the @entity207 in @entity55 , @entity56 - one of the worst hit nations they were tracked down by health authorities and ten remain under surveillance			0
within the @entity215 , free movement of people means someone unknowingly infected with @entity15 could easily drive through several neighbouring countries before feeling ill and seeking help , and spend weeks in contact with friends or strangers before becoming sick enough to show up on airport scanners			1
vital supplies destined to help in the fight against @entity15 raging through @entity100 have been sitting idly on a dock side for nearly two months			0
a shipping container packed with medical supplies has been locked at @entity230 port in the country since august 9 , the @entity226 reported			0
it contains 100 bags and boxes of hospital linens , 100 cases of protective suits , 80 of face masks , as well as gloves , stretchers , mattresses and other supplies vital to helping fight the epidemic			0
the items were donated by individuals and hospitals in the @entity4 , according to @entity246 , who organised the shipment			2
mr @entity249 is an opposition politican from president @entity252 's hometown of @entity253 - a region hit by the epidemic			0
a government official , told the @entity226 , he believes political tensions may have caused the delay in releasing the supplies , to prevent the opposition benefiting from being seen to bring in the donations			0
mr @entity249 said he expected the shipment to be welcomed by the authorities , and said he he expected the shipping fee of $ 6,500 would be a small price to pay			0
he said : ' they are blaming us for shipping in without authorisation			0
' it appears all they are interested in is cash donations			0
and all we have are supplies			0
' professor @entity272 , professor of molecular virology at @entity274 , said many cases ' can slip through the net ' despite screening at @entity32 airports			2
he added : ' whilst the risk of imported ebola virus remains small , it 's still a very real risk and one that wo n't go away until this outbreak is stopped			2
ebola virus is n't just an @entity32 problem			1
' however , the chance of the disease spreading widely or developing into an epidemic in a wealthy , developed country is extremely low , healthcare specialists say			1
according to the latest @entity15 risk assessment from the @entity293 , which monitors health and disease in the region , ' the capacity to detect and confirm cases ... is considered to be sufficient to interrupt any possible local transmission of the disease early '			2
dr @entity106 cited @entity121 as an example of how @entity15 can be halted with swift and detailed action			0
despite being in @entity32 and being home to one of the world 's most crowded , chaotic cities , @entity121 has managed to contain @entity15 's spread to a total of 20 cases and eight deaths , and looks likely to be declared free of the virus in coming weeks			1
' even if we have a worse case scenario where someone does n't present for medical treatment , or			2
. it 's not correctly identified as @entity15 , and we get secondary transmission , it 's not likely to be a very long secondary transmission chain , ' he said			0
' people are n't living in very crowded conditions ( in @entity120 ) , so the disease does n't have the same environment it has in a shanty town in @entity55 , where the environment is perfect for it to spread			2
' it 's a different matter in modern western cities with the very sanitised , sterile lives that we live			0
' so far one @entity330 , 29 - year - old nurse @entity329 , has contracted ebola , but he was diagnosed while volunteering in @entity100 and was transported to @entity12 in an isolation tent			1
mr @entity329 recovered and was discharged from the @entity333 in north @entity334 10 days after he landed .			0

disease spreading rapidly across @entity32 ; more than 3,400 people dead and 7,500 infected
the first case was confirmed in the @entity4 last week
114 people came into contact with him before he was diagnosed
scientists believe an infected person will arrive in the @entity12 before october 24
estimate a 75 ***%*** chance of the virus reaching @entity23 in that time
@entity24 has a 40 ***%*** chance of the disease reaching its shores , while @entity28 and @entity29 have lower risks , at 14 ***%*** each
