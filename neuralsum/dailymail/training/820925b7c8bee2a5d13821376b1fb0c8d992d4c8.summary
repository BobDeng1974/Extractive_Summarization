the @entity0 has ruled that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be banned in every country across the continent			2
in a declaration that will have huge implications on human rights laws in its 47 member countries , the @entity6 - based organisation announced that such practices ' must always be prohibited '			2
the move will represent a major setback to assisted dying campaigners in the @entity15 who want @entity15 to follow @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 in allowing doctors to help to end the lives of their patients			0
@entity23 issue : euthanasia and assisted suicide could now be banned in 47 member countries across the continent ( file picture ) the explicit condemnation of euthanasia was inserted into a non-binding resolution entitled ' protecting human rights and dignity by @entity32 '			2
the resolution had originally simply focused on the human rights questions of ' advance directives ' , or ' living wills ' , in which people set out how they wish to be treated if they became mentally incapacitated			1
but members of the @entity39 argued that living wills , which became legal in the @entity15 under the @entity41 , were inextricably connected to euthanasia			1
they successfully moved an amendment forbidding euthanasia by 34 votes to 16 with six abstentions			0
the amendment said that ' euthanasia , in the sense of the intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit must always be prohibited '			2
among those fighting for the amendment was @entity15 member @entity56 , the @entity57 mp for @entity58			1
thwarted : the move is a major setback for campaigners who had hoped @entity15 could follow @entity16 and @entity18 in allowing doctors to help patients end their lives ( file picture ) he referred to the case of @entity68 , a 26 - year - old from @entity69 who died in 2009 by poisoning after her living will prevented doctors from resuscitating her			1
he said : ' can my fellow delegates here in @entity6 imagine how they would feel if they received a phone call informing them that one of their children had drunk poison and that ambulance and hospital staff who had everything necessary to save the child â€™s life stood by not helping instead as the child lay dying ? ' that is a situation that advanced directives or living wills allow , ' mr @entity56 said			1
' this is not alarmist talk - this is the historic fact , the track record			0
' but @entity92 , the @entity93 mp for @entity94 , fought the amendment , saying it changed the ' entire nature ' of the report			1
' eighty - five per cent of the people of @entity15 are demanding reforms and demanding change , ' he said			0
' we as legislators must also take into account the majority view of the people , ' mr @entity92 added			0
' it is an important human right to have the right to die in a manner of our choosing			1
' @entity0 was set up in 1949 to further @entity114 integration by harmonising human rights laws , although it is unable to pass laws itself			0
its new resolution on euthanasia will , however , help to define the principles that should govern the application of living wills across its member states			1
it will be therefore hugely influential in helping governments to resist pressure to weaken or abolish laws prohibiting assisted suicide and euthanasia			0
@entity0 bases its work on the @entity132			0
it includes the @entity133 , which enforces the convention and to which @entity114 can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their rights .			0

delegates claim ' living wills ' for mentally incapacitated are inextricably linked to euthanasia
@entity57 mp cites death of 26 - year - old who could not be resuscitated after *drinking* poison
@entity93 mp says it is a human right to be able to die in manner of our choosing
