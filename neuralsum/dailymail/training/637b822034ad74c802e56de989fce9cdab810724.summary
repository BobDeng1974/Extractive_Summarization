@entity0 enjoyed their first @entity1 night since 2009 , seeing off @entity3 side @entity2 4 - 1 at @entity4			1
a @entity6 own goal set @entity8 's side on their way , before full backs @entity11 and @entity13 each scored			1
@entity15 added a fourth late on after being put through by @entity16 as @entity8 was given the perfect welcome to @entity1 football , and not even a brilliant stoppage - time @entity6 free kick could dampen the high spirits at @entity4			1
@entity22 's @entity21 was there and rates the @entity0 players ' performances below			2
@entity26 celebrates @entity0 's first goal which came when his shot was deflected in by a defender @entity30 7.5 not quite his @entity33 @entity32 heroics but an obstinate barrier nonetheless with a particularly fine diving stop from @entity36			1
@entity11 7.5 had the legs to face up to the challenge of facing former @entity40 winger @entity39 , and even popped up in the opposition penalty area to nod @entity43 second			2
@entity11 heads in @entity0 's second goal during a clinical performance against @entity2 @entity11 defended solidly against danger man @entity39 and popped up with a goal @entity47 6.5 been quite a season for the @entity50 new - boy and this was another no - nonsense display belying his years			1
@entity53 6.5 captain led by example , constantly encouraging and digging out colleagues			0
not in his best form bit certainly not hiding			0
@entity13 8 there is no finer sight than @entity13 roaring forward from left - back			0
his surge and supply to @entity26 led to the opening goal and as usual he made no mistake from the spot for number three			2
@entity13 tucks away his penalty during an excellent performance that saw him star for @entity0 @entity71 6 just his presence is reassuring for @entity8 given his experience			1
provided the security so @entity13 and @entity11 could bomb forward			2
did n't try anything spectacular but that is what @entity8 wants , covered the hard yards to help keep @entity2 out			0
@entity79 6 technically gifted , it was one of those evenings where a lot of his best work went unrewarded until he was fouled outside the area - and the referee awarded a penalty ! @entity26 7.5 on @entity91 referendum day , it was almost inevitable he should have a stormer			1
the @entity0 faithful chanted his name after his shot led to @entity6 's own goal			1
@entity26 runs at the @entity2 defence during a typically tenacious display at @entity4 @entity15 5.5 one of four @entity99 on show but it did n't inspire him			1
ran down too many blind alleys			0
booked but did partially redeem himself by scoring a well - taken late fourth			0
@entity104 6 it 's not quite happening for the Â£ 28million striker			0
had a wild slash into the sidenetting with a decent chance and failed when he took a free - kick in @entity13 territory			2
@entity104 was unable to produce his best play but worked hard as @entity0 's target man subs : @entity16 ( for @entity104 69 ) 6 @entity117 winner worked hard enough while slumming it in the @entity119			0
@entity120 ( for @entity26 82 ) manager : @entity8 7.5 will be delighted with his own @entity1 debut			0
put @entity2 away with attacking intent .			0

@entity13 involved in first three goals as @entity0 win easily
@entity26 shot leads to own goal
@entity11 heads in the second before half time
@entity13 *converts* a penalty after @entity79 was fouled outside *box*
@entity15 scores fourth late on
@entity6 scores brilliant free kick in stoppage time for @entity2
