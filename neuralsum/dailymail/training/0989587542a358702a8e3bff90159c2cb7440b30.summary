by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:38 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 16:16 est , 17 january 2014 ' lawfully killed ' : an inquest into the death of @entity5 , 29 , said he had been ' lawfully killed ' by police but they were criticised over the way they dealt with intelligence			1
the @entity11 said it is pursuing ' a number of significant lines of inquiry ' police firearms officers are to be banned from conferring after fatal shootings in the wake of the death of @entity5			1
the @entity11 is drawing up guidance to stop the practice of allowing marksmen to discuss what happened before they produce statements			1
the police watchdog announced the move yesterday as it apologised to the @entity26 family for releasing wrong details about his death			1
conferring over notes is currently allowed in guidelines set out by the @entity32			2
but there have been a number of attempts to stop firearms officers comparing notes following a series of high - profile police shootings , including that of barrister @entity40 who was killed during a siege in @entity42 in 2008			1
his family tried to have an @entity11 investigation into his killing ruled unlawful because officers talked among themselves before providing statements			1
they failed , although mr @entity50 agreed that conferring opened the gates for institutionalised collusion			0
@entity5 ’s family sought a judicial review of police protocol on the issue , but were unsuccessful			1
now the @entity11 – which has itself called three times for conferring to end – wants the home secretary to sign off statutory guidance forcing officers to separate before they give statements on fatal incidents , including deaths in custody			1
@entity11 deputy chairman @entity67 said : ‘ we will expect police officers to comply with it			1
’ the @entity11 is still pursuing lines of inquiry following the conclusion of @entity26 ’s inquest last week			1
investigators want to talk to officers involved in the case who have refused to be interviewed in person			0
the gangster was shot by a @entity81 marksman in august 2011			0
the inquest jury found he was lawfully shot , despite not having a gun in his hand			2
the @entity11 was criticised for failing to contact his family in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , and for initially wrongly telling journalists he had fired a shot			1
@entity67 , deputy chairwoman of the police watchdog , revealed the body is trying to speak to officers who have either so far refused to be interviewed or who have given conflicting accounts of what happened			1
seeking justice : mr @entity26 's aunt @entity99 ( pictured ) claimed he had been ' executed ' and his family have vowed to fight for justice			0
the @entity11 was heavily criticised for failing to contact his family in the immediate aftermath of his death although the inquest concluded that mr @entity26 had been ' lawfully killed ' it criticised the @entity104 and @entity105 over its intelligence regarding the 29 - year - old collecting the gun			1
the inquest finished last week but the @entity11 is still trying to clarify inconsistencies over how the police acted by speaking to people who have given information that contradicts ' other evidence '			1
it is set to issue new guidance that will ban officers from conferring before giving statements in the aftermath of fatal shootings			1
the police watchdog has apologised to the family of @entity5 , whose death sparked the @entity42 riots of 2011			1
ms @entity67 said she ' sincerely apologised ' for the media being ' wrongly ' told he had fired at police before he was shot			0
she stressed the watchdog is determined to speak to witnesses who have so far refused or have given potentially misleading information			2
' we expect police officers to cooperate fully with us if required , including answering questions at interview , something they have so far refused to do			0
” mr @entity26 ’s family and their lawyers met with chairwoman of the @entity11 @entity139 and ms @entity67 on tuesday to discuss the watchdog ’s investigation			1
relatives of the father - of - six were left furious at the inquest finding that he was lawfully shot by police , despite not having a gun in his hand at the time			2
the @entity11 was also heavily criticised for failing to contact his family in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , and for initially wrongly telling journalists that he had fired a shot			2
ms @entity67 added : ' we know that the family ’s confidence in us and our investigation was damaged by mistakes made in the early stages - both in relation to inaccurate information we provided to the media , and the initial management of the incident			0
' i would like again to record my sincere apology to them that on the evening that @entity40 was fatally shot by a police officer a member of our staff wrongly led the media to believe that he had fired at police officers			0
i fully understand the damaging impact of this			0
” ' this inquest and our own review of the way we investigate deaths show the problems that can arise when officers confer when writing up their notes following fatal incidents , ' she said			0
' we have therefore decided to issue our own statutory guidance on post-incident management following death or serious injury			0
the guidance will cover conferring and the separation of officers			2
legally , we have to consult on the content of this guidance			0
' once agreed by the home secretary , we will expect police officers to comply with it , and call them to account if they do not			0
' police believed he planned to collect a gun from another man , @entity203 , and then go on to @entity204 , also in @entity205			0
officers involved in the case have refused to be interviewed in person by the @entity11 , only agreeing to answer questions in writing			2
dame @entity139 said their failure to co-operate had delayed the inquiry by nearly a year			0
@entity212 , from the charity inquest that has backed mr @entity26 ’s family since his death , said : ' i think the failure of police officers to agree to be interviewed is one of the most contentious issues following deaths in police custody			2
' it ’s one that has caused serious concern and frustration among bereaved families			0
' if you are a citizen you have the right to silence but an inference can be drawn from it , and you would be pursued			0
it would n’t be the same for a police officer who fails to co-operate and just gets on with their life			0
