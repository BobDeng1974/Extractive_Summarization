in a 35 - minute conversation with his @entity6 lawyers last week , mr @entity1 also told how he was made to watch as a @entity39 detainee was beaten in front of him : ' [ the man was ] stripped to his underwear and hung upside down			1
' they beat the soles of his feet , poured cold water on him and said they would electrocute him			2
there was screaming all around me and it was pretty horrific			0
' mr @entity1 claims that the next day he was taken out of his cell and warned that if he did not co-operate he would be abused and beaten in the same way			1
he says the @entity17 interrogators then stripped him to his underwear , blindfolded him and told him he would be sexually abused			1
during the first three weeks of his detention , mr @entity1 claims he was interrogated only by @entity17 officers in a cell in the intelligence headquarters near the @entity58 in a downtown area of the capital , @entity61			1
other detainees sharing his cell told how they had been tortured			1
he said many had been forced to endure ' beatings , being sexually abused , being pinned down naked and their testicles beaten '			1
mr @entity1 claims that he was then handed over to the @entity20			1
he described how the first team of two @entity20 interrogators ignored his pleas to alert the @entity6 authorities to his detention and torture			0
jails : @entity1 is in the @entity73 in @entity28 where his family tracked him down just before @entity31 he claims they knew that he had been badly treated , but let him believe that he faced far worse if he refused to co-operate			1
a second team of three @entity20 interrogators – whom he says treated him better – then persuaded him to sign a confession and ' disclaimer ' in which he agreed to waive his right to silence			1
it was also believed at first that mr @entity1 was held for a time at @entity20 's military base in @entity17 , @entity85			1
mr @entity1 , a former care worker , lost contact with his family while staying in @entity12 last year			1
when they began looking for him , they were told by @entity90 officials that the @entity6 government could not provide assistance because home secretary @entity93 had issued an order depriving him of his @entity6 citizenship over allegations of @entity98 extremism			2
now it has emerged that between august and the middle of november he was being questioned by teams of agents from the @entity10 and @entity103 while being held in @entity17			0
mr @entity1 was picked up with two @entity39 somalis by @entity17 police after he travelled to the country during the summer			1
after his alleged four - month ordeal , mr @entity1 was shackled and put on a plane to the @entity20 , where he is now to stand trial on charges of terrorism			1
critics have warned that mr @entity1 's case raises serious concerns about @entity20 's reliance on torture techniques and rendition programmes in the fight against terror			1
many of these have been highlighted in the @entity123 - nominated film @entity122 , which focuses on the hunt for @entity125			0
a @entity126 at @entity85 in @entity61			0
mr @entity1 claims @entity20 interrogators persuaded him to sign a confession in the movie , which is released on friday , a prisoner is waterboarded for information about future terror attacks ; later , the same prisoner gives up the code name of @entity125 's courier			1
it is this information that eventually leads to his capture and death in an isolated @entity140 compound on may 2 , 2011			0
critics of @entity122 , who include senator @entity142 and filmmaker @entity143 , say the film is an endorsement of torture because it connects ' enhanced interrogation ' to successful and accurate intelligence			0
mr @entity1 's @entity6 lawyers , @entity150 and @entity151 , claim @entity10 interrogators fully exploited the torture techniques of the secret police in @entity17			1
mr @entity151 said : ' these revelations will cast serious doubts on the credibility of the evidence that is being used against @entity1			1
' the prosecuting authorities in the @entity20 should be compelled by the trial judge to explain the exact circumstances in which this evidence was gathered			0
' if @entity6 is involved in rendition to @entity17 or @entity20 , government ministers need to be reminded that the police have opened a criminal investigation against @entity167 for the allegations of complicity on the renditions of @entity172 opponents to @entity173			0
' the events leading up to the kidnapping and rendition of @entity1 seem to indicate that while the government may have changed , old practices continue			1
' mr @entity167 , who was home secretary and then foreign secretary in @entity179 's @entity177 , has always strenuously denied these allegations of complicity in rendition			0
@entity182 , a spokesman for human rights charity @entity183 , said : ' we believe that because of the problems that the @entity188 has had with deportations and extraditions , it has been easier for them to remove the citizenship of individuals , thus allowing them to be victims of rendition by third - party countries			0
' last night it emerged that a @entity6 court will hear mr @entity1 's case to restore his @entity6 passport			1
it raises the prospect that his @entity20 trial could take place before his lawyers have the chance to challenge the home secretary over her decision to strip him of his nationality rights			0
the @entity209 in @entity22 dismissed mrs may 's attempts to block mr @entity1 's claim and lifted an anonymity order stopping the media from reporting his case			2
documents have also been released by the @entity217 of the @entity218 , which reveal that mr @entity1 and two @entity39 men were detained in @entity9 by ' local authorities ' in august before being handed over to the @entity103 on november 14 and flown to @entity28 the following day			1
detained : mr @entity1 was believed to be held for a time at @entity20 's military base in @entity17 , @entity85 ( pictured ) they accuse the three men of providing material support to @entity225 , which is fighting a war against the @entity20 - backed government in @entity12			2

if convicted , he faces life in prison			0
mr @entity1 arrived in @entity22 at the age of five after his family left @entity12			2
had he remained a @entity6 citizen , he would have been put on trial in the @entity6 over allegations of supporting international terrorism			0
his family strongly deny that mr @entity1 has ever been involved in terrorism and insist that he was planning to return to @entity22 to complete his education			2
the case has led to allegations that the @entity20 and the @entity6 governments may have conspired to kidnap him and then send him to @entity17 , where @entity20 has a counter- terrorism base			0
his parents , @entity248 and @entity249 , first became concerned about their son 's safety after being tipped off that he had been taken to a prison in @entity17			0
the information was passed to them by another prisoner after their son begged him to get a message to his family			0
the note contained claims that he had been ' mistreated ' and was being interrogated by men working ' for @entity20 '			0
after the prisoner was released , he made his way back to @entity12 where he contacted mr @entity1 's wife			1
although his mother - in - law travelled from @entity265 in @entity12 to the @entity17 prison in a bid to contact him , prison staff refused to say whether he was there			0
the family also approached the @entity20 authorities , but were told that they had no information about him			2
in october , @entity272 revealed that , even though mr @entity1 was not in the @entity6 , the home secretary had used a little - known power to deprive him of his rights as a @entity6 national			2
mrs may has issued at least nine of the deprivation of citizenship orders – which do not require a court order – against @entity6 nationals , the majority of whom have been @entity286 men			0
the most public case was that of the @entity289 spy @entity288 , who was married to a @entity6 national			0
the order signed by mrs may , and seen by @entity272 , states that mr @entity1 lost his rights to live in the @entity6 because of the ' public good '			2
the letter adds : ' as secretary of state , i hereby give notice ... that i intend to have an order made to deprive @entity298 of your @entity6 citizenship			2
' this is because i am satisfied that it would be conducive to the public good to do so			0
the reason for this decision is that the @entity306 assess that you have been involved in @entity309 extremism and present a risk to the national security of the @entity6 due to your extremist activities			0
' mr @entity1 's family say they only discovered the harsh terms of the order when they approached the @entity90 for help to find him			2
