by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:45 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 09:53 est , 26 september 2013 the @entity2 has moved to distance itself from the outspoken @entity4 official who attacked the government ’s welfare reforms			1
@entity7 branded @entity8 a ‘ loopy @entity4 leftie ’ after she flew into the @entity9 to criticise the ‘ bedroom tax ’ changes to housing benefit			1
now the @entity2 has slapped her down , insisting she is not a member of staff and has nothing to do with @entity17 ban ki - moon			1
controversy : the @entity2 's @entity19 on the right to adequate housing , @entity8 , declared : ' my immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished ' miss @entity8 ’s extraordinary intervention in @entity9 politics , claiming cuts to benefits was an infringement of human rights , sparked warnings that she had undermined the impartiality of the @entity2			1
in her two - week tour @entity33 , who is the @entity2 special rapporteur on housing , repeatedly borrowed @entity38 ’s favoured description of the policy as a bedroom tax and appeared with campaigners at protest rallies			1
she also suggested the idea of rent controls in the private sector , condemned the right - to - buy policy on council homes and insisted more public money should be spent on building social housing			1
@entity51 chairman @entity50 wrote to mr @entity52 demanding an investigation into the official ’s conduct			2
but aides to the @entity17 have disowned her remarks			0
@entity58 , from the officer of the @entity60 , insisted miss @entity8 was in the @entity9 in an ‘ independent capacity ’ and is ‘ neither accountable to nor appointed by ’ mr @entity52			1
disowned : @entity2 secretary general @entity17 has distanced himself from miss @entity8 's remarks in a letter to mr @entity50 she said : ‘ ms @entity8 is one of 72 independent experts appointed by the @entity65 - the led @entity2 body responsible for human rights – on the basis of their expertise and independence , and following a competitive selection process			1
‘ as in the case of all mandate holders , ms @entity8 serves in an independent capacity and in accordance with a @entity78 adopted by the @entity65			1
‘ she is not a staff member of the @entity2 , is neither accountable to nor appointed by the @entity17 , and does not receive any compensation beyond a daily allowance when engaged in mandated activities			1
’ miss @entity8 is expected to submit a final report to the @entity2 in march next year			1
but the slap down from mr @entity52 ’s officials will limit the impact of her final recommendations			2
mr @entity50 said : ‘ people expect the @entity2 to be neutral , yet on this occasion a former @entity90 politician came with a clear agenda			1
’ ministers say the removal of the ‘ spare room subsidy ’ brings social housing into line with the private sector where renters do not get spare rooms for free			0
the change will is expected to save around £ 500 million every year			0
tenants affected by the shake - up will face a 14 per cent cut in housing benefit for the first excess bedroom , and 25 per cent where two or more bedrooms are unused			2
ministers , who estimate the average affected household will lose £ 14 a week , say the policy will save taxpayers £ 500million a year			0
they also say it will encourage people to move into smaller properties to relieve pressure on stock , helping families crammed into homes that are too small			0
during her visit @entity33 revealed a shaky grasp of @entity9 house prices by saying : ‘ how many people can afford to buy a £ 120,000 apartment ? not many			1
’ mps pointed out that in @entity4 tens of millions of people are condemned to living in shanty towns , or favelas the @entity4 , who has spent much of her five - year @entity2 post looking at human rights violations in countries including @entity131 , @entity132 , and @entity133 , has decided that @entity9 ’s housing system is ‘ going backwards ’			1
she said at the end of her visit : ‘ my immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished			0
' i was very shocked to hear how many people feel abused in their human rights by this decision and why - being so vulnerable - they should pay for the cost of the economic downturn , which was brought about by the financial crisis			1
‘ the right to housing is not about a roof anywhere , at any cost , without any social ties			0
‘ it is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night			0
' it is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds , their local schools , work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights , like education , work , food and health			2
’ the academic , brought up a @entity169 , actually offered an animal sacrifice to @entity171 her lengthy cv lists countless qualifications , civic achievements , books and publications – but @entity8 makes no mention of dabbling in witchcraft			1
yet the architect and urban planner appears to be an avid follower of @entity182 , an @entity184 - @entity4 religion that originated during the slave trade			2
the academic , brought up a @entity169 , actually offered an animal sacrifice to @entity171 when she was studying for her masters degree in architecture so ‘ he would leave her alone ’ to study in peace			0
according to her elder sister @entity193 , a well - known @entity4 psychoanalyst and intellectual , @entity8 had become ‘ contaminated ’ by other philosophies and offered the sacrifice to appease the @entity197 revolutionary socialist			1
the @entity2 special rapporteur ’s fascination with @entity182 rekindled memories of another controversial figure ’s links with the religion that worships @entity184 gods			1
in 2001 , @entity205 was ridiculed when reports emerged that his @entity4 partner , @entity207 , had engaged a @entity182 witch doctor to put a hex on political enemies in a ceremony involving the slaughter of a chicken			2
it was claimed that the @entity38 spin doctor – now a peer – held a live chicken by the neck while a priest in @entity220 cut off its head , splashing mr @entity205 with blood			0
mother - of - two @entity223 lives in @entity224 , @entity4 ’s biggest city , and is a professor at the city university ’s faculty of @entity228 and @entity229			2
her @entity231 grandfather died in the holocaust and her parents emigrated to @entity4			0
she has held various government positions , speaks six languages , and was appointed to her @entity2 post in 2008			1
in an interview , her sister suely gave more clues about @entity8 ’s upbringing and background			1
she said : ‘ my little sister – who is much younger than me – and i have always felt the same			0
' i was born in @entity246 [ a poor area of @entity224 ] , my parents are immigrants and we never tried to hide this , we do not feel well in high class , bourgeois places			0
‘ she was always brilliant academically			0
so she wanted to show that these forms of housing , including tenement houses , favela housing etc , are n’t the only solutions to poverty			0
she wanted to show that there were other alternatives			0
‘ she lived in communes at the time , she went to @entity184 , the @entity261 , @entity262 , she went to the houses of @entity184 witch doctors to find out what was the memory of housing in @entity184 , during slavery			0
but the university did n’t accept her thesis			0
‘ i greatly admire her work , her courage , the work she is doing with the @entity2 is fantastic , she is very precocious			2
’ @entity193 said @entity8 came to live with her in @entity273 in the 1970s and became interested in @entity275 philosophers			2
‘ when she went to do her masters , she offered an ebo – an animal sacrifice – to @entity171 , so he would leave her in peace			0
‘ because , as well as having a @entity169 formation at the university , when we were small our parents put us in the @entity284			0
‘ @entity8 had a really solid @entity169 formation			2
so she had to give an ebo to @entity171 in @entity182 so he would leave her alone			0

@entity8 flew into the @entity9 to assess impact of benefits changes
she said that so - called ' @entity291 ' is a *breach* of human rights
@entity7 condemned the political attack and demanded an *inquiry*
@entity2 secretary general ban ki - moon disowns the ' independent ' official
