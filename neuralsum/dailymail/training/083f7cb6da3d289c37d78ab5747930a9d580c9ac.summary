many a fan enjoys watching the tennis while sipping tea poured from a @entity4 flask			2
but now terrorism fears have ended even this most innocent of @entity8 activities			1
security guards are confiscating flasks during compulsory bag searches at the entrance gates			1
tea-less at tennis : @entity8 fans have been forced to leave their tea at the gate after a new ban on @entity19 has been enforced fans who arrived unaware of the crackdown were forced to leave their flasks at left luggage areas in the car parks – for a £ 5 fee			1
simply handing the flask to security and returning later to pick it up is not an option as the flask will be thrown away			2
spectators called the ban outrageous , particularly because cups of tea and coffee on sale inside the club cost £ 3			1
one @entity39 guard told an irate woman made to surrender her flask that the ban was being enforced because of last year ’s atrocity at the @entity44 , where a pressure cooker in a rucksack was used as an explosive that killed three and injured 176			1
safety measure : thermos flasks have been banned in the wake of the @entity44 bombings there are fears that thermos flasks - or vacuum flasks – could also be turned into bombs if packed with explosives			1
at one entrance to @entity8 yesterday , security staff had confiscated a dozen flasks by midday			1
a guard said that while the ban was introduced last year , security had been briefed to rigorously enforce it at this year ’s championships			1
as well as the risk of terrorism , there were also concerns that disruptive fans might lob them onto courts during play , he said			1
but @entity74 , philanthropy advisor and author , said : ‘ i queued on monday , as i have in about four previous years , and i ’ve always thought it rather delightful that one can take in food and drink			2
‘ i ’ve always taken a flask of tea but this year you ca n’t take them in , so i had to check mine in the left luggage before security - tea and all			2
‘ if you look at their hilarious leaflet about ‘ the queue ’ , the list of banned items includes thermos flasks , but not hard - sided bottles of water			1
‘ honestly , what injury can you cause a player with a thermos that you could n’t cause with a @entity101 bottle ? of course @entity102 want to bring tea			1
’ novelist @entity104 wrote on @entity105 : ‘ @entity8 security guards confiscated my coffee thermos			1
‘ i fought for my rights but they were steely eyed and relentless # thirsty @entity8 ’ and @entity110 posted : ‘ ca n’t serve yourself some hot tea while watching the games ? outrageous ! # @entity8			2
’ as anger grew , one local cafe helped thirsty fans by offering free cups of coffee in @entity8			1
@entity118 said on @entity105 : ‘ thermos flasks banned from # @entity8			1
need a @entity121 fix ? we ’ll be serving # free # coffee in # sw19 this fortnight ! ’ spectators can not leave thermos flasks at the gate and collect them later			1
any that are left will be thrown out			2
however , they have the option to take them to left luggage areas near car parks around the club for a £ 5 charge			0
tradition : several fans have protested against the new ban , lamenting not having a hot drink while watching the tennis cool boxes and camping chairs are also banned but bottles of wine and spirits and up to two beers are allowed			1
other items spectators are banned from bringing include bags exceeding 16 ’ by 12 ’ and items which may be interpreted as a ‘ potential weapon ’ including knives , large corkscrews and ‘ personal protection ’ sprays			2
clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification intended for ‘ ambush marketing ’ are also forbidden , as are banners , rattles , klaxons and oversized hats			0
@entity161 flouted an additional @entity163 rule which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft when he unfurled a @entity165 in the @entity166 on @entity167 after @entity169 ’s historic win last year			0
the @entity171 first minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife ’s handbag before waving around behind @entity178 ’s head as he celebrated the victory			0
he later insisted no - one sticks to the rule banning large flags around @entity167 , and after waiting 117 years for a @entity182 to win the men ’s singles ‘ a few @entity181 hoisted over @entity8 does n’t really harm at all ’			0
a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we try to ensure that visitors know in advance our conditions of entry which are widely publicised			0
’ emotional : @entity189 was visibly moved on the court tuesday reigning @entity8 champion @entity189 wept as she stepped out on @entity167 for the first time since lifting the trophy last summer			0
the @entity194 tennis star , who has since been forced to retire due to a shoulder injury , became emotional after she received a standing ovation from the crowd			2
it was all the more poignant because she was taking part in a commemorative coin toss in honour of @entity202 , a former @entity204 number one , who died of liver cancer last month aged 30			0
the 29 - year - old wiped away tears before she performed the toss with @entity209 , a nine - year - old pupil at the @entity210 , in @entity211			0
she later apologised for her tears , tweeting : ‘ i ’m sorry i got so emotional			0
i could n’t hold my tears being on the @entity167 & supporting # rally4bally , ’ referring to @entity202 ’s charity			0
last year , miss @entity189 was the victim of sexist remarks by @entity217 commentator @entity216 , who suggested she had become so successful because she was ‘ never going to be a looker ’			0
however , the pair worked together at the @entity220 last month and she proved she had put the comments behind her by sitting on the @entity217 sofa yesterday to give her verdict on her fellow players			0
asked about the episode earlier in the week , she laughed and said she had a ‘ very short memory ’ , adding : ‘ last year for me it was all about winning @entity8			0
’ in the @entity166 yesterday , there was a face - off in the moustache stakes			0
sir @entity232 , seen above with @entity234 co-host @entity233 , was preened to perfection but he was eclipsed by a rather dastardly looking @entity236 , who is playing @entity237 in a new movie .			0
