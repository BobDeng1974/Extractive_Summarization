by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 storm clouds gathered around @entity3 ’s as gloom enveloped @entity5 and an @entity7 side who will surely crash to defeat in a second test the captain could not afford to lose			1
not even the rain that lashed much of @entity12 could save @entity5 as @entity3 ’s remained stubbornly dry but dark and threatening , a reflection of the mood that has taken hold of the @entity7 captain and his developing side			1
@entity5 battled so hard to reach 22 off 93 balls and hand @entity7 a tantalising glimpse of a successful pursuit of 319 to win this crucial match before he fell in what has become a grimly predictable fashion outside off stump			1
what a pickle @entity7 will be in if an @entity52 team who have not won abroad for three years go on to take the last six wickets and claim a 1 - 0 lead with three to play in this @entity57 series			1
@entity52 have won just one of their 16 tests at @entity39 before now and only five @entity59 anywhere in @entity7 , a reflection of the travel sickness that should have made them perfect opponents for the ‘ new ’ @entity7			1
that is how bad defeat here would be but there remains no appetite within the @entity71 nor among his team for @entity5 to stand down now			0
not after @entity7 have invested so much in him in the wake of an @entity77 disaster that claimed so many high - profile @entity79 casualties			2
the @entity71 believe that @entity5 and @entity80 are creating the culture and environment for young players to flourish they wanted post-ashes and that it is the senior men who are letting the captain down at the worst possible time			2
only if @entity5 falls on his sword ahead of next sunday ’s third test will there be a sad end to his captaincy now and even if he is inclined to do that there will be influential voices who will urge him to fight on			2
no - one at @entity39 would have believed at the start of this season that @entity7 would lose in all formats to @entity100 and then go one down to @entity52 , with the captain extending his long run without a century to 27 innings			1
yet that will be the sorry scenario unless @entity106 and @entity107 extend their unbeaten partnership of 32 to the point where the second highest successful run chase in @entity7 ’s history once again comes into view			2
@entity113 evenly poised - @entity26 bowled : @entity30 fails to deal with a ball from @entity32 during the fourth day of the second test bad day : @entity116 sums up @entity7 's feelings on day four of the second test rare celebration : @entity119 gets @entity52 's @entity120 out for 68 during the second test at @entity39 it is conceivable , with @entity7 batting so far down , that they could yet score the 214 runs they still need but this is a team who have forgotten how to win , an @entity7 side enduring a run as bad as any suffered in the last 21 years			1
even if @entity5 and @entity7 stand firm and battle on they will still have to accept that this would be the most horrible , embarrassing defeat in conditions that were tailor - made for them once they had won a crucial toss			1
@entity7 could justifiably claim that their groundsmen , who had provided subcontinental pitches this summer before now , were doing nothing to help them but @entity139 gave them the perfect stage here to finally flourish			0
this indeed has been close to the perfect @entity59 pitch , with help for the seamers on day one , then decent if challenging batting conditions before spin started to play its part on day four			0
it is a model every ground should follow			0
but that simply exacerbates @entity7 ’s misery			0
they did not bowl well enough again on sunday as @entity52 , 145 ahead overnight , were able to move into a position where they would become hot favourites in a compelling test			0
delighted : @entity7 captain cook looks happy at catching out @entity52 's @entity158 there was hope for @entity7 when they took two wickets for one run just ahead of the new ball but once again they allowed the tail to wag vigorously , a stand of 99 for the eighth wicket between @entity120 and @entity167 leaving the wheels well and truly off @entity7 ’s wagon			1
how painful for @entity7 that their tormentor should be @entity120 , the man at the centre of the incident at @entity173 that leaves @entity174 facing a suspension when a preliminary hearing begins via @entity177 on tuesday			0
the combative all - rounder signalled his intention to attack from the off , and could easily have holed out to @entity107 , who was again under - used by @entity5 , before he settled in to smash 68 from 57 balls that should prove decisive			2
alongside him again was @entity167 , who should have been caught by @entity106 on two , a hugely costly miss , but who then went on to score his third half - century of the series from no 9 to add to his six - wicket first - innings haul			0
high expectations : @entity7 failed to impress home crowd at a packed lord 's on day four of the second test @entity174 and @entity36 , in particular , could do little to stem the flow , 66 runs coming in 10 overs after lunch , and it would be no surprise if @entity36 ’s badly hurting knee stops him playing at the @entity197			0
he is woefully short of his best			0
it was @entity120 , struck on the helmet by @entity174 when he batted , who was again a thorn in @entity7 ’s side with the ball , trapping @entity204 on the front foot with his first ball to gain a correct decision that never would have been given before the decision - review system			0
@entity5 and @entity216 steadied the ship , helped by some bizarre captaincy from @entity35 , until @entity7 ’s house came tumbling down with those three quick wickets , the captain trudging off to a sympathetic reception from @entity212 members that is a reflection of the affection he still commands			1
the question now is whether that is enough for @entity5 to ride a storm far greater than the thunder and lightning that rumbled around the home of cricket but refused to come to @entity7 ’s rescue			1
familiar sight : @entity52 celebrate the wicket of @entity7 's @entity216			0

@entity7 were set a target of 319 to win the second test at @entity39
under - fire @entity7 captain @entity5 out for 22
@entity30 bowled out for just one run off the bowling of @entity32
