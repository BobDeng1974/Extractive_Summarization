' if @entity10 targets @entity3 , @entity6 bears responsibility			1

' personally i do not expect the @entity10 enemy - at least in the coming months or foreseeable future - ( to wage ) an attack on the @entity43 of @entity3 , ' he said			1
@entity3 has previously claimed to have the capability to carry out these threats against @entity6 bases			0
on july 4 , @entity3 declared that it could destroy nearby @entity6 military bases and strike @entity10 with minutes of an attack on their country			1
general @entity51 of @entity3 's @entity52 said in july that @entity6 bases are in range of @entity3 's missiles and could be targeted in retaliatory strikes			1

@entity70 has approached @entity37 through two unidentified @entity72 countries , the @entity69 newspaper said			0

deal made ? @entity10 ¿ s biggest - selling newspaper says @entity6 has secretly negotiated with @entity3 to keep the @entity6 out of a future @entity10 - @entity3 war ; @entity3 's prime minister @entity83 , left , is welcomed by @entity3 president @entity84 in @entity37 last week an @entity10 official , who asked not to be identified , described the report as illogical			1
the @entity87 did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the @entity10 newspaper story , which appeared during the @entity92 holiday			2
president @entity93 is fighting accusations from his @entity96 challenger @entity95 that he is lax in support for @entity10 , @entity70 ’s long - term ally in the @entity7			0
the @entity93 administration says it is strongly committed to @entity10 ’s security and to preventing @entity3 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			2
@entity87 spokesman @entity102 said on sunday : ' i can tell you that there is absolutely no daylight between the @entity6 and @entity10 when it comes to the necessity of preventing @entity3 from acquiring a nuclear weapon			1
' an @entity10 official said : ' it does n’t make sense			0
there would be no need to make such a promise to the @entity3 because they realise the last thing they need is to attack @entity6 targets and draw massive @entity6 bombing raids			2
' the @entity6 and @entity10 both accuse @entity3 of developing nuclear capability that could be used to make a weapon , and have both said they reserve the right to take military action to prevent @entity3 from making a bomb			1
@entity93 's assurance : @entity10 ¿ s deputy prime minister @entity129 said he still believed @entity93 ¿ s assurances that @entity70 was prepared to use force if needed to prevent @entity3 from developing a bomb however , the @entity93 administration has repeatedly made clear in public that it thinks diplomacy and tough new sanctions have not yet run their course , even as @entity10 officials say the window for effective military action is rapidly closing			2

' @entity10 ’s deputy prime minister @entity129 said he still believed @entity93 ’s assurances that @entity70 was prepared to use force if needed to prevent @entity3 from developing a bomb			0
' i do n’t know what kind of messages @entity69 heard , ' @entity129 said			0
' but i think the @entity3 understand ... that if they cross a line towards a bomb , they could encounter very strong resistance , including all the options that are on the table - as the @entity6 president has said			0
' drawing the line : on sunday , @entity10 prime minister @entity161 said the time had come for world powers to declare a ' clear red line ' for @entity3 's nuclear activities @entity69 is a mainstream newspaper , not known for taking a particular political line on @entity6 - @entity10 ties			1
