the glare of a low - lying sun - a particular problem for drivers each october - has contributed to an average of 28 road deaths a year since 2010 , according to figures highlighted by the @entity7			1
around 3,900 road users a year are injured after being dazzled by the sun , with north west @entity11 drivers the worst affected , the @entity7 said			1
the motoring organisation drew attention to the figures as sunrise and sunset move into the morning and evening rush hours until the clocks go back on sunday october 26			2
at this time of year many @entity35 motorists have to contend with a low sun on their morning commute and then face being dazzled as the sun sets as they travel home in the evening			2
the @entity7 said that in north west @entity11 , 2.2 people are killed or injured for each reported sun - dazzle accident - well above the national average of 1.4			1
another badly affected area is @entity44 and @entity45 where the figure is 1.6			0
@entity7 president @entity47 said : ' many slower and more vulnerable road users - joggers , dog walkers , pedestrians , cyclists and horse riders - will be trying to take advantage of the last of the light evenings before the clocks go back			1
all road users need to be fully aware of the potential twilight dangers			2
the @entity27 , which takes drivers towards @entity29 , is a particularly bad road for glare from the sun ' joggers , dog walkers , workers returning home on foot and other pedestrians walking with their backs to vehicles are almost twice as likely to be killed or seriously injured in road accidents			1
' mr @entity47 went on : ' research conducted for the @entity7 , from official 2004 pedestrian casualty statistics , shows that 10.8 per cent of the 5,566 pedestrians killed or seriously injured when in the road were walking or running with their backs to the traffic			0
this compares with 5.9 per cent of the casualties who were facing oncoming cars			0
' @entity81 research also shows that the rate of head - on crashes involving lorries nearly quadruples in twilight conditions			0
' although up to 10 per cent of accidents in which trucks leave the road , roll over , hit each other head - on or up the back happen in twilight conditions , up to 40 per cent of head - on accidents with cars happen when the sun is low in the sky			0
they also tend to happen on rural roads			0
