ms @entity12 , who presents alongside @entity33 , said it was a miracle no one died police began a chase in @entity38 , @entity39 - near @entity40 - and scrambled several cars and a helicopter before it ended beside west @entity7 's @entity24 at 1pm yesterday			1
the @entity43 , which had been chased by a convoy of officers along the @entity46 into @entity7 , smashed into a @entity47 behind @entity49 presenter ms @entity12 's car			1
the @entity43 spun five times across the road , passing within inches of ms @entity12 's car , while the driver of the @entity54 had to be taken to hospital with neck injuries			1
by chance the crash was also witnessed by @entity11 veteran ms @entity10 , 44 , as she walked with her three - year - old daughter and pushed her four - month - old baby in a pram			1
the ' dazed ' driver of the @entity43 - which ms @entity12 said had been travelling at up to 70mph - remained shocked in his car before escaping on foot			1

' it was one of those moments when you think " one of my nine lives has been used up " , ' she said			0
' i think it 's a miracle no one was killed			2
the guy was completely crazy , all over the place			0
' we were pulling out of the road when the crash happened and the car the got hit was behind us			2
the @entity43 spun round about five times and ended up face to face with us			0
' there was debris everywhere and we were right in the middle of it all			0
' we went to help the guy in the car before realised he was being chased by police			2
he was in the car with the airbag up , his head back and his eyes were rolling back			0
he then got out the car and ran			0
' we then turned our attention to this other guy , the driver of the car that got hit , who got dragged out of his car			2
' he was on his knees and covered in blood			0
it 's a miracle he did n't get killed			2
' it happened so fast - a huge noise and impact and you kind of process it what 's happened afterwards and realise it could have been a lot worse			2
my thoughts are with him and his family			0
' the driver of the @entity54 was taken to @entity81 in @entity82 , south @entity7 , with neck injuries which were not thought to be life - threatening			1
@entity24 was also closed as the debris was cleared up			0
ms @entity12 said the incident had made her look at news reporting differently			1
she said : ' i reported the worst ever motorway crash , on the @entity146 in @entity147 on @entity148 , and i was on the side of the road for several days but i guess this is the first time i 've been a bit too close for comfort			0
damage : the front of the @entity54 was left wrecked in the crash , and the driver had to be taken to hospital cleanup : the road was closed as dozens of witnesses gathered at the scene to help those affected ' as a journalist you report on the most horrendous things and it 's just part of the job			1
but when it 's " real life " it 's totally different and makes you think about how you report these things			0
' she and ms @entity10 live in the same area of west @entity7 , but have never met socially			1
' we messaged on @entity173 and we will probably be quite pally through this , ' she said			0
' i saw that she tweeted about it so i sent her a message saying " glad you 're okay "			0
we were both a bit shaken up			0
' a @entity181 spokesman said : ' at around 12.20pm yesterday , a @entity43 failed to stop for a marked police car in the @entity38 area of @entity39			1
' a pursuit followed which involved a number of @entity181 vehicles and a police helicopter			0
' the @entity43 travelled onto the @entity46 and into the @entity7 area where the @entity189 joined and led the pursuit			2
