the man in the mask is back			2
but it might take more than a slice of carbon fibre to protect @entity5 from what could be a quite hateful reception when he takes his first steps at the @entity9 since he left to join @entity10			1
that 2011 move was seen and widely accepted - externally - as the prodigal son going home			2
this next fixture is seen by some as the return of a player who rejected a second coming at @entity19 in favour of @entity21			1
he will surely win the league , having already won the @entity24 , but what has he lost at the club that made him ? what of the line of communication he once had with @entity31 ? @entity5 will be making his first return to the @entity9 since leaving @entity19 in 2011 the 27 - year - old is expected to wear a protective mask when he travels to north @entity35 this weekend fabregas joined @entity19 as a teenager ( left ) before returning to the @entity38 with @entity21 ( right ) @entity19 boss @entity31 speaks to a young @entity5 after snatching him away from @entity10 in 2004 it has been suggested they have not spoken since @entity5 made the summer move that got so many backs up			1
there is nothing terribly unusual in that except they used to be so close , to the extent that @entity31 continued to text @entity5 on birthdays and career milestones while he was at @entity10			1
‘ he has n’t spoken to me since i came back , ’ @entity5 was quoted as saying in september			1
‘ it was the kind of relationship i always would have liked to keep			2
‘ but i 'm sure once everything dies down a bit in the future we will talk			2
i 'll always be grateful to him whatever happens			2
’ except there is still believed to be only silence from the man he once called his ‘ second father ’			2
and for the first time , the @entity5 narrative is something less than delightfully romantic			1
until now he had followed a largely clean script			2
he was the boy who attended his first @entity10 match as a nine - month - old baby with his grandfather			2
the tale of how he came to be their player 10 years later is wonderful			0
the story goes that he was playing for @entity77 , 35km north of @entity10			0
@entity78 used to search the surrounding areas for young players for @entity10 ’s under 11s side and one day watched @entity5 ’s team			1
when he came back , two months later in september 1997 , he saw a midfielder he simply needed to sign			0
@entity87 legend @entity86 watches on as @entity5 plays a pass during training early in his career @entity5 ' only piece of major silverware with @entity19 was winning the 2005 @entity93 against @entity94 former captain @entity95 ( right ) helped @entity96 come through the ranks at @entity19 fabregas impressed by scoring against @entity99 as @entity19 reached the 2006 @entity101 final the @entity102 is involved in a scuffle with his future club during the 2007 @entity24 final ‘ i went to see them play again and suddenly i saw this one player who was simply wonderful , ’ he told the @entity106			1
‘ they told me he was called @entity5 and he was one year younger than the rest			1
he was good at running with the ball , had a fantastic pass over short , medium and long distances			2
he was very mature for his age and had all the attributes we were looking for at @entity10 at that time			0
‘ at half - time , i asked the coach why i had not seen this kid before			0
he admitted that , when he saw me coming , he had decided not to play him because he knew that if i saw him i would take him			0
’ he ultimately became part of a group that included @entity124 , coming through the ranks			0
his idol was @entity128 and when @entity5 ’s parents divorced in 2001 , @entity128 handed him a signed shirt with the message : ‘ one day , you will be the number four of @entity10			1
’ @entity31 bestows his wisdom on a young @entity5 during a training session at @entity134 in 2008 @entity5 celebrates a a goal with former @entity19 team - mates @entity137 ( left ) and @entity138 @entity5 holds aloft the trophy after winning the the 2008 @entity140 with @entity141 @entity5 lifts the @entity142 after winning the pre-season tournament with @entity19 in 2009 @entity5 trains with another @entity19 star to leave the @entity9 , @entity145 , in 2010 the @entity19 playmaker scores a penalty against @entity148 in the @entity101 in 2010 alas , he left for @entity19 in 2003 having not been picked for a single first - team game			1
by the time he returned in 2011 , he had become @entity19 ’s youngest first - team player , their captain and a @entity153 and @entity154 winner with @entity141			1
in 2005 , aged 18 and with 60 first - team games already played , he told @entity156 : ‘ i will always be a fan of @entity10			0
but @entity19 gave me an opportunity			1
it 's like you are standing at a station and there 's a train that you must take			0
it 's the opportunity of your life			0
‘ at @entity10 , i was playing for the @entity165			0
here , they gave me the opportunity to play for the reserves straight away , soon the @entity24			0
it gave me the motivation that i needed			0
now i want to improve , get more mature , get more experience			0
’ @entity5 celebrates with @entity141 team - mate @entity169 en route to wining the @entity171 in @entity172 @entity141 team - mates attempt to engineer a move to @entity10 by pulling a club shirt over @entity5 in 2010 @entity5 walks off dejected after @entity19 crash out to his boyhood club @entity10 in the 2011 @entity101 the midfielder 's relationship with mentor @entity31 became strained after he left @entity19 in 2011 six years on from that interview , he detailed his relationship with the club and @entity31 as he explained why he was joining @entity128 ’s @entity10			1
‘ i only won one @entity93 really , and this is the biggest regret i will have in my career , probably , not to be able to lift a trophy as @entity19 captain , ’ he said			1
‘ i will always be an @entity19 fan because what they have done for me is unbelievable and i will never forget it			1
‘ @entity31 is a special person to me			1
he 'll always be a second father to me			0
i think if @entity19 want to keep being the club they are then they have to always be under his control , because he 's the best , everyone respects him , and for me , he will always be the best person that i 've met in football			1
‘ i 'll never be able to find the words to express my thanks for what he did for me			0
’ @entity5 is given a hero 's welcome on his return home to the @entity200 with @entity10 @entity124 ( right ) celebrates with @entity5 after scoring his first goal for @entity10 in 2011 fabregas scored against @entity203 in the group stages as @entity141 went on to win the 2012 @entity153 @entity5 gets involved in a row with @entity21 stars as @entity10 are sent out of the 2012 @entity101 @entity141 stars @entity207 ( left ) , @entity208 ( centre ) and @entity5 crash out of the @entity211 by that point , it would be hard to blame the rationale in wanting a move to @entity10 , but staff at @entity19 were disappointed in how the switch was pushed through			1
what followed was a three - season spell that has , perhaps , been unfairly characterised			0
the suggestion is that he under - performed at @entity10 , which in part is the fault of the club itself			0
upon leaving last summer , the club , oddly , flagged up in an official statement that he tends to flag in the second half of seasons			2
they were right , as this campaign has proved , but it was unusual for a club to say so much			0
in any case , he won @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 winners ’ medals and in his second season , only @entity242 had more @entity237 starts			0
it was not exceptional , though , and last summer came the chance to leave , bringing with it much of the confusion that still surrounds the midfielder			0
wenger himself gave the impression that there is more to know about the circumstances behind the move to @entity21 , saying on thursday : ‘ we will have to discuss that one day			1
’ the 27 - year - old celebrates scoring against @entity258 in his debut season at @entity260 @entity5 played against his former club with @entity21 for the first time in october 2014 @entity5 still keeps in touch with @entity19 legend @entity95 , with the pair attending a @entity266 game in @entity35 @entity5 celebrates scoring the only goal against local rivals @entity268 at @entity269 earlier this month @entity5 wears a protective mask as @entity21 defeat @entity94 to close in on the 2015 title sport analysts @entity273 are predicting a tight match , with @entity19 slight favourites to beat @entity21 @entity5 said in a statement last summer that @entity19 ‘ decided ’ not to trigger an option they held to re-sign him			1
@entity31 has previously claimed that by the time he knew @entity5 was available a deal with @entity21 was almost done			1
it is interesting to wonder how much from either side is @entity281 and how much is genuine			0
did either side really want the other ? at the very least @entity96 will likely endure a tough afternoon under his mask on sunday			2
he might soon have that league title he craved , but it will not have come without some significant losses .			0

@entity21 travel to @entity19 for their @entity38 clash on sunday
this will be @entity5 ' first return to the @entity9 since leaving
his relationship with @entity31 has *deteriorated* since he left in 2011
wenger : @entity19 fans should give @entity5 a good welcome
