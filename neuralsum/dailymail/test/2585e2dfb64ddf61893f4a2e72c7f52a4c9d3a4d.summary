it was , as so often this season , the story of two @entity3 rising stars in the form of their young lives			1
they have rampaged through opposition defences both at home and abroad all season			2
they have already been crowned kings of @entity12 in the @entity13			0
and here , with yet another devastating performance , they put @entity3 within touching distance of retaining the @entity16 , in the process further augmenting their remarkable goalscoring tallies and enhancing their growing reputations			1
@entity20 wheels away in celebration as he notches for @entity3 away at @entity24 in the @entity16 final first leg @entity3 striker @entity26 opens the scoring against @entity28 with an impressive right - footed shot into the far corner @entity31 is mobbed by his @entity24 team - mates following his equaliser against @entity3 in the @entity16 @entity26 is congratulated by his @entity3 team - mates as his acrobatic effort regained their advantage against @entity24 @entity26 is congratulated by his @entity3 team - mates having given the west @entity38 side the lead against @entity24 after @entity24 were put to the sword in this first leg on monday night , the pair ’s records for the season stand like this : @entity20 - 36 goals ; @entity47 - 35 goals			1
that ’s one hell of a return			0
both are in that special moment of form where it is nigh on impossible to miss and that was the case here as the dark @entity56 from @entity38 established a healthy advantage to take into the second leg at @entity59 in seven days ’ time			0
when @entity47 had raced through to make it 3 - 1 just before the end , you sensed it was a fatal blow			1
of course there is a chance @entity24 may fight back - nothing is out of the question in youth football - but there was something about @entity3 ’s dominance here that suggests it is unlikely			1
this was the most high - profile meeting yet of @entity78 ’s two most ambitious and well - resourced academies and , for the moment , it is definitely @entity3 who are on top			2
another tickertape parade surely awaits for this group of players next week			0
‘ obviously it ’s a daunting place to come , ’ said @entity3 coach @entity86			2
‘ but we wanted to make sure we did what we do best , dominate possession , get right up against them and press hard			0
the way the lads implemented what we spoke about before the game was outstanding			0
’ indeed it was and the unfailing right boot of @entity26 provided a moment to savour after just seven minutes			1
even the technically fiendish chances are flying in for the unstoppable @entity78 under 18 forward at the moment and that was proven when he controlled @entity104 ’s laser - guided cross-field pass and sent the ball arrowing beyond goalkeeper @entity106 into the top corner			0
within minutes , @entity26 was trending on @entity113 , clips of his immaculate hit racking up the retweets the world over			1
by half - time , his name was attracting more interest in the @entity117 than any other subject			0
by then he had a second , restoring @entity3 ’s lead on 20 minutes after @entity121 had briefly restored parity for the hosts			1
goal no 36 of the campaign was n’t quite as memorable as no 35 but it was athletic , @entity26 hooking the ball home from six yards out after @entity130 ’s header from a @entity104 corner had been saved by the foot of @entity106 and then headed back into his vicinity			1
from then , aside from a five - minute flurry late on when @entity24 had genuine chances to equalise , @entity3 were in complete command			1
they enjoyed the lion ’s share of possession and looked comfortable in their game plan , in each other and in themselves			0
@entity3 youngster @entity47 scores the west @entity38 side 's third goal of the game with just minutes to play @entity24 goalkeeper @entity144 comes under pressure from @entity3 as both sides look to win the aerial ball @entity47 ’s late third was a hammer blow after the @entity24 pressure , a typically calm finish after @entity152 slipped him through			1
it had actually been a quiet night for @entity47 but this goal preserves his remarkable record of scoring in every round of this season ’s @entity16			1
incidentally , he also scored in every round of their @entity13 triumph too for good measure			0
@entity24 , who were watched by @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and a near - full house at their handsome @entity167 , had levelled within two minutes of @entity26 ’s opener			1
@entity3 were guilty of a lapse in defensive concentration very unlike them and @entity24 swept through to punish			1
under - fire @entity24 manager @entity163 ( centre ) enjoys a night in the sun as he watches the club 's future stars in action @entity26 shows he 's not scared of a tackle as he comes up against @entity24 's @entity178 in the @entity16 final injured @entity24 defender @entity164 watches on as the club 's youngest stars take on @entity3 in @entity28 @entity24 : @entity106 ; @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 ( c ) , @entity185 ; @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity178 ( @entity188 85 ) , @entity121 , @entity189 substitutes not used : @entity190 ( gk ) ; @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 scorer : @entity121 9 @entity3 : @entity195 ; @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity130 ( @entity201 90 +1 ) , @entity104 ( c ) , @entity26 ( @entity202 67 ) , @entity152 ( @entity203 89 ) , @entity47 substitutes not used : @entity204 ( gk ) ; @entity202 , @entity183 scorers : @entity26 7 , 20 ; @entity47 89 referee : @entity207 ( @entity208 ) attendance : 6,421 @entity189 spent much of the first - half struggling in his battle with @entity196 on the @entity24 left but on this occasion , he dived in - field and made a purposeful run in the direction of the @entity3 box			1
looking up , he saw @entity121 darting through and supplied a slide - rule pass that the forward slickly rolled past @entity195 into the far corner			2
but they did n't kick on and seize control			0
@entity26 ’s exertions eventually took their toll and he went off in some discomfort midway through the second - half			2
it proved the catalyst for a @entity24 revival and the chances missed in this bright spell would prove costly			2
first , @entity228 nutmegged @entity229 and brushed off @entity200 but blazed wastefully wide			0
and there was soon an even - better chance for @entity186 , who stole the ball from @entity104 , but fired over from a great position			0
they ramped it up further with @entity189 running clear down the left and forcing @entity195 to block with his feet			0
a minute or two later , @entity47 scored			2
@entity86 was proud of the performance but still exercised a note of caution : ‘ we got the goal on the break , @entity47 was very clinical and i think that 3 - 1 scoreline does n’t overly flatter us because their spell was just a spell in amongst a game we dominated			1
‘ we do n’t need to be reminded that you need to be switched on and professional next week			0
’ his city counterpart @entity251 was bullish about the chances of a comeback : ‘ it ’s definitely not game over , we ’ll go down to @entity59 and anything can happen down there			0
if we get a goal , we ’ll see what character they ’ve got			0
at 3 - 1 we ’re still in the tie			0
' but for that to happen , they ’ll have to neutralise @entity3 ’s relentless , remorseless forward duo			2
@entity3 youngster @entity263 battles alongside @entity178 during the @entity16 final first leg in @entity28 @entity24 coaching duo @entity265 and @entity266 watch on as @entity24 's young stars take on @entity3 in @entity28 @entity3 striker @entity130 does his best to brush away the attentions of @entity24 's @entity269 in the first half			1

@entity20 opened the scoring for @entity3 with a fine strike with just seven minutes of the game played
but , @entity3 's lead did n't last long as the hosts levelled the scores two minutes later via @entity121
some poor defending from @entity24 allowed @entity26 to grab an acrobatic second to restore their lead
@entity3 wrapped up the win in the closing stages when @entity47 broke free and *slotted* an effort home
