a @entity2 's branch emptied its kosher food shelf after the manager feared anti-israeli protesters outside would attack it , the supermarket giant has said			1
meats , cheeses and sauces were removed from a @entity2 's local branch in @entity10 , central @entity11 , as it was picketed by demonstrators who were calling on the grocer to boycott @entity15 goods			1
the incident yesterday afternoon happened on the same day @entity19 activists ' wreaked havoc ' at a @entity21 branch of @entity22 when a demonstration got out of hand			1
actor @entity25 took a photo of the empty shelf , prompting uproar online as hundreds condemned the grocer for appearing to succumb to the demands of the protesters			2
people also pointed out that many of the goods were not from @entity15 and instead came from nations including @entity37 and @entity38			1
but a passer - by claimed staff said : ' we support @entity48 ' mr @entity25 wrote that a staff member defended the decision by stating : ' we support @entity48 '			1
when he then pointed out the distinction between @entity15 and kosher goods , staff ' walked away ' , he wrote			1
the move yesterday sparked online accusations of @entity56 by the grocer – despite the @entity60 ’s well - documented @entity59 ancestry dating back as far as the 19th century			0
@entity2 's insisted the decision was taken in case protesters hurled food from the shelves , which would then have to be thrown away			1
but @entity66 user @entity65 made a formal complaint about the incident , which happened half a mile from the company 's headquarters at @entity11 's @entity71			1
he wrote to @entity2 's : ' i presume you are aware that kosher food is produced in countries other than @entity15 ? you are therefore not making a political statement against @entity15 but instead are targeting a group based on race - i.e. @entity59			1
before and after : theatre actor @entity25 visited the store when the goods were removed yesterday ( left ) before returning today ( right ) , assuring other internet users that a staff member had been ' suitably chastised ' controversy : the incident yesterday happened at this @entity2 's local branch in @entity10 , central @entity11			1
a spokesman insisted it was ' not company policy at all ' and had only been done to stop food being damaged ' as a jew i find this deeply offensive			1
naturally i am against the death of innocent children in @entity95 so why are you persecuting me by denying me the right to buy kosher food ? ' i presume you are also removing @entity100 food in protest against the @entity102 slaughtering @entity103			0
clearly not - therefore you have blurred the line between political statement and hate crime			0
' the incident at the @entity109 's branch comes in the context of a rise in anti-semitic attacks			2
last month @entity37 saw the second-most anti-semitic incidents in any month since records began in 1984 , according to a jewish community organisation			2
the @entity116 recorded 200 incidents in july , suggesting a huge increase since the @entity95 conflict began on july 8			0
the first six months of 2014 saw 304 anti-semitic incidents , a 36 per cent rise on the same period last year , the @entity116 said			0

he said : ' it is more important than ever that in the face of the deeply upsetting events taking place in @entity95 , @entity15 , @entity130 and @entity131 that @entity37 ’s many diverse communities stand united in supporting our shared @entity37 values of understanding and mutual respect			1
' former @entity138 mp @entity137 also waded into the row , writing on @entity140 : ' @entity142 kosher is @entity59 food			0
@entity145 equate @entity59 ' food to @entity15 , how dare you # @entity148 '			2
pro-palestinian protesters in @entity37 have long urged supporters to boycott @entity15 goods , though not kosher goods , to send a message to @entity15 over its blockade of @entity95			1
the incident yesterday happened on the same day as demonstrators ‘ wreaked havoc ’ in a @entity22 store after a protest against its stocking of @entity15 food got out of hand			1
protesters accused of hurling produce and attacking police at the supermarket in @entity166 , @entity21 , are being hunted by officers			0

@entity22 sells fruit , peppers , potatoes and herbs from @entity15 , along with branded goods			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we do this in line with the @entity195 position on trade with @entity15 , and we mark all products clearly with the country of origin , so customers can make informed choices about what to buy			2
’ the protest outside the @entity204 's was thought to have been a smaller demonstration , not one of the huge marches which have taken place in @entity11 since the @entity95 conflict began on july 8			2
the @entity210 coalition organised a protest in central @entity11 yesterday but it marched through a different part of the city , from the @entity215 embassy in @entity216 to @entity217			1
fury : former @entity138 mp @entity137 waded into the row , saying to remove the food was discrimination debate : she called anti-israeli protesters ' racist b * * * * * * * ' and said the supermarket should not have moved food protest : ms @entity137 used the hashtag # @entity229 to criticise the branch manager 's decision mr @entity25 returned to the branch this evening and found the kosher food shelf had been fully reinstated , adding : ' @entity2 's assure me the staff member has been suitably chastised			1
' the firm admitted the kosher food was removed but challenged mr @entity25 's version of events			2
a @entity2 's spokesman told @entity242 there was ' no evidence ' that a staff member had made the ' @entity48 ' comment and instead the decision was taken to stop protesters damaging the food			1
the spokesman added : ' it was the manager 's decision there and then - not company policy at all			2
we are a non-political organisation and we 're not coming down on either side of the argument			0
' we have had similar demonstrations at stores where people have gone in and removed goods , though no great damage was done			2
' a decision was taken by a store manager faced with a challenging situation outside the store '			0
anger : the incident happened yesterday as police officers were allegedly attacked when an anti-israeli protest at this branch of @entity22 in @entity166 , @entity21 , got out of hand			2
stock was thrown around the store heavy police presence : several officers were pictured outside the @entity22 during the demonstration she confirmed the protest had been specifically against the @entity2 's , but was unable to say how large it was			1
it was not believed to be targeted at the giant 's nearby headquarters			0
@entity2 's added in a statement : ' the decision was taken to move these products to chilled storage elsewhere in the store for a short period on saturday as a precautionary measure during an ongoing demonstration close to the store			1
' they were returned to shelf as soon as was practically possible			0
we apologise for any inconvenience caused			0
' there was still no firm peace deal as the clock ticked towards a five - day ceasefire expiring in @entity95 tomorrow at midnight ( 9pm gmt )			0
officials said tonight that @entity302 was still opposed to the latest proposal but other @entity305 factions , including delegates representing president @entity307 , were inclined to accept			0

some 67 @entity15 have also been killed , 64 of them soldiers			0
@entity302 officials said they were holding out in the hope of winning more concessions in the talks , which have been mediated by @entity215			0

' we are less optimistic than we were earlier , ' he said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the talks with the media			0
@entity302 is demanding an end to the @entity15 - @entity215 blockade on @entity95 which has existed in its current form since 2007			0
the blockade , which @entity15 says is needed to prevent arms smuggling , has ground @entity95 's economy to a standstill by restricting imports , limiting the movement of people in and out of the territory and blocking virtually all exports .			2
