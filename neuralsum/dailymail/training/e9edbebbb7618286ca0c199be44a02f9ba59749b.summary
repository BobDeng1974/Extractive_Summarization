the ice bucket challenge may seem cool if you live in a place which is usually quite hot , but for those who dwell in a cold climate the idea is probably less impressive			1
like if you lived in chilly @entity11 , for example , the sensation of tipping a bucket of ice water over your head is probably not dissimilar to leaving the house on a rainy day			2
so it 's perhaps no wonder that it 's a @entity11 scientist who has staged the most spectacular spin yet of the ice bucket challenge â€“ using minus 195 degree @entity20 liquid nitrogen			1
cool cat : @entity11 scientist @entity22 grabs a bucket and pours liquid nitrogen over his head survivor : mr @entity22 before and after the challenge , which appears to have been staged outside his work a spectacular video shows @entity22 , 34 , a physicist from @entity30 , @entity31 , as he grabs the bucket and pours the bitterly cold liquid over his head			1
seconds earlier he had taken a branch with some leaves from a nearby tree and plunged into the liquid nitrogen , freezing it instantly so it could be crumbled into shards in his hands			0
yet when he pours the liquid nitrogen over his head , instead of freezing himself solid , he simply shakes his head and indicates yes , it is cold , but i 'm still here			2
the video first appeared on the @entity46 channel of @entity47 as part of a project called ' what happens if we try this ... ' mr @entity22 said before the challenge : ' i am putting my faith in the laws of physics , biology and mathematics and i hope nothing will go wrong			1
' just to make sure he is not frozen solid after taking the liquid bath , his friend pokes him to check he is still soft as the intrepid scientist laughs into the camera			0
you still human bro ? mr @entity22 is poked by his friend to make sure he 's not turned to ice ice cold : before enduring the challenge mr @entity22 had shown the effect of the liquid nitrogen on a leaf by dipping it in for a few seconds then crumbling it between his hands it 's possible for liquid nitrogen to pass on top of human flesh without freezing , because when it is poured onto the human body , something called the @entity83 effect comes into play			1
this is a phenomenon in which a liquid produces a layer of insulating vapour that prevents the liquid coming into direct contact with a surface significantly hotter than the liquid 's boiling point			0
that is to say , because liquid nitrogen has such a low temperature , when it comes in contact with human skin , the temperature difference causes the @entity83 effect and it simply skims off the surface of the body			2
similar effects can be seen when water is sprinkled onto a heated pan that is above the water 's @entity83 point			0
the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate because of the layer of vapour forming around the liquid			0
however , if you were to keep your hand in liquid nitrogen and it cooled down to below the @entity83 point , it would be subject to the harmful effects of liquid nitrogen as we know it .			0

the bitterly cold liquid has a temperature of minus @entity124
but @entity22 , 34 , is *unafraid* to pour a bucket of it over his head
' i am putting my faith in the laws of physics , ' he says before the challenge
