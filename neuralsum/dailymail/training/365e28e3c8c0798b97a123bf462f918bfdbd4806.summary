by @entity0 a pensioner is claiming he has cured himself of diabetes - thanks to two intense 12 - minute work outs a week			1
@entity4 , 67 , of @entity5 in @entity6 , suffered so badly from the condition he was worried it would kill him any minute			1
he had been classed as having a high risk of a heart attack or stroke , and it got to the point where his condition was so bad he feared going to sleep in case he failed to wake up			1
@entity4 , a 67 - year - old pensioner from @entity5 in @entity6 has claimed that his intense 12 - minute exercise routine twice a week has cured his diabetes and halved his cholesterol doctors were stunned when they saw the results of the short bursts of exercise , and have begun to consider weaning him off of his diabetes medication for seven years the retired @entity25 officer battled the condition , failing to reduce his dangerously high cholesterol , blood sugar and blood pressure levels			1
he altered his diet and walked five miles a day , but nothing helped his condition			0
in a last ditch effort he began exercising in two 12 - minute bursts a week , a fraction of the recommended two and a half hours , but he claims this has turned his life around			1
his sessions , which take place at his local community centre in @entity5 , consist of warm ups and then a series of high intensity aerobic activity			2
the programme supports new thinking that short , intense , exercise sessions can be just as beneficial as longer work - out regimes			2
mr @entity4 joined four months ago in which time his glucose and cholesterol levels , which were nearly double what they should be , have almost halved			1
his reduced blood sugar and blood pressure levels have even caused doctors to plan to start weaning him off of his diabetes drugs , and his twice daily blood sugar tests have become only once daily			1
the exercises raise mr @entity4 's heart rate and have reduced his blood sugar and blood pressure levels mr @entity4 said : ' the exercises might only be for 12 minutes but my metabolism keeps working hard for the next 24 hours			1
' i noticed an improvement in the first month			0
' when i went back to the doctors two weeks ago , they were absolutely astounded			0
' they said ‘ what on earth have you been doing ? ' ' i do n’t consider myself to be a diabetic any more			0
' i feel free to enjoy my life			0
i ca n’t believe the difference in myself			0
' mr @entity4 was told he had type 2 diabetes the day after his 60th birthday , after complaining of severe tiredness and thirst and being referred for tests			1
his declining health culminated with a minor stroke while at work two years ago			2
' i felt a strange tingling feeling down my face			0
' i felt sort of wobbly , one side of my face started to droop and i could n’t hold my pen			0
' a colleague drove me to my gp and the doctor said you ’re not leaving here unless in an ambulance , so i was taken to hospital where i was told i ’d suffered a minor stroke , a forewarning to a bigger one			2
' the minor stroke caused @entity4 to take retirement , fearing the stress of work was a contributing factor			1
mr @entity4 is on an exercise programme called @entity100 , or @entity101 for short			2
it is a new programme and has already shown health benefits , such as weight loss and the reversal of type 2 diabetes			1
it can be achieved by exercising for just 12 minutes two or three times a week			0
it starts with a brief warm up and then participants begin stretching , running and jumping - all to raise the heart rate quickly			0
the exercises last for 30 seconds each and are followed by a 90 - second recovery			0
@entity101 sessions are run by the health and exercise charity more @entity119 .			0
