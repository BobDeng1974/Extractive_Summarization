by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 26 february 2013 traces of extraterrestrial life are most likely to be first detected on planets orbiting dying stars , according to new research			1
a theoretical study of @entity8 - like planets orbiting white dwarf stars found we could detect oxygen in the atmosphere of one much more easily than on those orbiting a star like our own @entity15 large quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere of a distant planet would signal the likely presence of life there			1
this is based on the fact that if all life on @entity8 was to die out , our atmosphere would become devoid of oxygen , as it relies on plant life to replenish the supply through photosynthesis			1
new research claims signs of life would be easier to detect on such planets using space telescopes ' in the quest for extraterrestrial biological signatures , the first stars we study should be white dwarfs , ' said @entity47 , of the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			1
when a star like the @entity15 dies , it sloughs off its outer layers , leaving behind a hot core called a white dwarf			0
typically about the size of @entity8 , a white dwarf slowly cools and fades over time , but it can retain heat long enough to warm a nearby world for billions of years			0
since a white dwarf is much smaller and fainter than the @entity15 , a planet would have to be much closer in to be habitable with liquid water on its surface			1
such a planet would circle the white dwarf once every 10 hours at a distance of about a million miles			2
before a star becomes a white dwarf it swells into a red giant , engulfing and destroying any nearby planets			0
so a planet would have to arrive in the habitable zone after the star evolved into a white dwarf			2
it could form from leftover dust and gas ( making it a second - generation world ) , or migrate inward from a larger distance , researchers say			0
previous research has suggested that the abundance of heavy elements on the surface of white dwarfs indicates that a significant fraction of them have rocky planets			0
professor @entity47 and his colleague @entity88 , professor of physics and astronomy at @entity91 , estimate that a survey of the 500 closest white dwarfs could spot one or more habitable planets			0
last hurrah : this @entity96 image shows a star as it casts off its outer layers of gas , which formed a cocoon around the core			0
the white dwarf star which remains appears as a white dot in the centre the best method for finding such planets is , they say , a transit search - looking for a star that dims as an orbiting planet crosses in front of it			2
since a white dwarf is about the same size as @entity8 , an @entity8 - sized planet would block a large fraction of its light and create an obvious signal			2
more importantly , we can only study the atmospheres of transiting planets			0
the @entity122 ( sometimes called @entity122 ) is a large , infrared - optimised space telescope due to be launched in 2018			1
with a large 21.3ft diameter mirror and a sunshield the size of a tennis court , the new space telescope is set to succeed @entity96 as the foremost deep space observatory			0
it will float in an orbit one million miles from @entity8			0
@entity132 said : ' @entity133 will be the premier observatory of the next decade , serving thousands of astronomers worldwide			0
' it will study every phase in the history of our @entity139 , ranging from the first luminous glows after the @entity142 , to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like @entity8 , to the evolution of our own @entity148			2
' several innovative technologies have been developed for @entity133			0
these include a folding , segmented primary mirror , adjusted to shape after launch ; ultra-lightweight beryllium optics ; detectors able to record extremely weak signals , microshutters that enable programmable object selection for the spectrograph ; and a cryocooler for cooling the @entity163 detectors to @entity164			2
there will be four science instruments on @entity133 : the @entity167 ( @entity168 ) , the @entity169 ( @entity170 ) , the @entity171 ( @entity171 ) , and the @entity173 / @entity172 and @entity174 ( @entity175 )			0
@entity133 's instruments will be designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum , with some capability in the visible range			0
it will be sensitive to light from 0.6 to 28 micrometers in wavelength			0
the new space telescope is an international collaboration between @entity132 , the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) , and the @entity187 ( @entity187 ) , with the project managed from @entity132 's @entity189			0
when the white dwarf 's light shines through the ring of air that surrounds the planet 's silhouetted disk , the atmosphere absorbs some starlight			1
this leaves chemical fingerprints showing whether that air contains water vapour , or even signatures of life , such as oxygen			1
astronomers are particularly interested in finding oxygen because the oxygen in the @entity8 's atmosphere is continuously replenished , through photosynthesis , by plant life			1
were all life to cease on @entity8 , our atmosphere would quickly become devoid of oxygen , which would dissolve in the oceans and oxidise the surface			1
thus , the presence of large quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere of a distant planet would signal the likely presence of life there			1
it is hoped that @entity132 's @entity122 , scheduled for launch by the end of this decade , will have the ability to sniff out the gases of these alien worlds			1
professors @entity47 and @entity88 created a synthetic spectrum , replicating what space telescope would see if it examined a habitable planet orbiting a white dwarf			2
they found that both oxygen and water vapour would be detectable with only a few hours of total observation time			2
' @entity122 offers the best hope of finding an inhabited planet in the near future , ' said professor @entity88			1
recent research by @entity48 astronomers @entity243 and @entity244 showed that the closest habitable planet is likely to orbit a red dwarf star ( a cool , low - mass star undergoing nuclear fusion )			0
since a red dwarf , although smaller and fainter than the @entity15 , is much larger and brighter than a white dwarf , its glare would overwhelm the faint signal from an orbiting planet 's atmosphere			1
even an instrument as sophisticated as the @entity122 would have to observe hundreds of hours of transits to have any hope of analyzing the atmosphere 's composition			1
' although the closest habitable planet might orbit a red dwarf star , the closest one we can easily prove to be life - bearing might orbit a white dwarf , ' said professor @entity47 .			1

chemical ' fingerprints ' of oxygen easier to detect on such worlds
oxygen in the atmosphere would suggest the planet harbours plant life
but *conclusive* evidence will have to wait until the launch of the @entity122 in 2018
