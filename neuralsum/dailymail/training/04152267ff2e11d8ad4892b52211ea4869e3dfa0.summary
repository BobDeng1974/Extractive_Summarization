a super-slick , catamaran - like craft is being touted as the 21st century answer to the speedboat			2
the @entity3 uses c - shaped hydrofoils to lift the craft out of the water , allowing it to reach a top speed of 25mph ( 40kph )			1
the shape of the four foils creates lift , to haul the vessel above the surface of the water and travel with minimal water resistance and in turn very little noise			0
the @entity3 ( pictured ) uses hydrofoils to lift the craft out of the water and allow it to reach a top speed of 25mph ( 40kph ) marine engineers from @entity26 , who invented the craft , described it as ‘ a thrilling yet quiet and eco-friendly watercraft ’			1
‘ its silent motor and zero emissions enable it to ride on lakes , rivers , seas & eco-zones where most motor boats and @entity39 ’s are not allowed			2
no noise , no waves , no emissions			0
’ the @entity3 has four hydrofoils , which are wing - like lifting surfaces that operate in water			1
they look like airfoils used by aeroplanes and are mounted on struts below the hull when speed is gained , they lift the boat 's hull out of the water , decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds			1
the foils are shaped to move smoothly through the water causing water flow to be deflected downward , which exerts an upward force on the foil			0
this turning of the water causes higher pressure on the bottom and reduced pressure on the top of the foil			0
this pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference , so the resulting flow about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other			0
when used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat , this upward force lifts the body of the vessel , decreasing drag and increasing speed			0
the shape of the four foils creates lift , to drag the vessel above the surface of the water ( pictured ) and travel with minimal water resistance height : 3ft 11 inches ( 1.2 metres ) length : 9ft 10 inches ( 3 metres ) width with foils : 8ft 2 inches ( 2.5 metres ) weight : 220lbs ( 100kg ) seats : 2 speed : 25mph ( 40kph ) range : 62 miles ( 100km ) on a full battery batteries : @entity98 cost : € 22,500 ( £ 17,586 or $ 28,144 ) shipping date : march 2015 the craft costs € 22,500 ( £ 17,586 or $ 28,144 ) and will be shipped in march next year			1
it is powered by an electric motor and will cost less than 80p ( $ 1.3 ) an hour to run			1
the @entity3 is easy to operate , according to its creators and the steering wheel has an integrated touch screen display to show a user how much battery power the boat has left , as well as its range and speed			1
the battery will give the craft a range of 62miles ( 100km ) on a single charge			1
the wheel will act as a detachable key , so that no - one else can start the engine when it is removed			0
the boat has an integrated steering system , which is designed to keep the craft stable , prevents drifting and makes the craft responsive			2
it is made to be stable and stay horizontal at all times because of the foil design , which places the centre of gravity 26 ft ( eight metres ) above the vessel			0
the lightweight hull is built from composite materials and weighs just 220 lbs ( 100kg )			0
despite claiming the @entity3 is unsinkable and super stable , the craft will come with two life jackets , a paddle and safety whistle			2
the craft ( pictured ) , which costs £ 12,000 ( $ 19,200 ) is powered by an electric motor and costs less than 80p ( $ 1.3 ) an hour to run			1
it is designed to be a luxurious recreational vehicle the boat has an integrated steering system , which keeps the craft stable , prevents drifting and makes the craft responsive			2
it is designed to be stable ( illustrated ) and stay horizontal at all times because of the foil design , which places the centre of gravity 26 ft ( eight metres ) above the vessel			0
