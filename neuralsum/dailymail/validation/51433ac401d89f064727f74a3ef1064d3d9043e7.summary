no parent wants to hear that their child is a bully - and thanks to the stiff punishment he dreamed up , this father is unlikely to hear it twice			2
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was shocked to find out his son @entity11 had been mistreating a classmate , and in response gave him a tough workout , gardening duty and instructions to apologize			1
for the physically grueling stages of his 5 - part punishment , @entity11 was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push - ups on his fists			1
spelling it out : @entity8 was shocked to heard his son , @entity11 , had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him next , the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher , incline push - ups , then running a mile			1
early - morning @entity10 temperatures are still routinely below freezing			2
but @entity11 's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time			0
punished : @entity11 , pictured , was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs but the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with @entity11 also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after , which was set to happen wednesday			1
@entity8 then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment , and encouraged people to share it			0
