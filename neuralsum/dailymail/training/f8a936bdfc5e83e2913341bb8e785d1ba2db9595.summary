by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the image of the lazy student should be consigned to the history books , according to the minister in charge of the nation ’s universities			1
instead of ‘ dossing around ’ fantasising about revolution in @entity12 , the new crop of undergraduates work for longer hours , miss fewer lectures and complain about homework not being marked on time			0
@entity17 minister @entity16 told @entity1 students are now ‘ more - serious minded ’ , and willing to complain if their university is not giving them the £ 9,000 education they are paying through fees			1
instead of skipping lectures to stay in bed , today 's generation of students are demanding more from their universities to get value for money for their £ 9,000 tuition fees instead of clutching a copy of @entity32 today ’s students are more likely to be perusing the complaints procedure at their faculty , mr @entity16 claims			1
mr @entity16 said : ‘ my experience now going to meet students is that they are not , by and large , plotting @entity38 revolution in @entity12			1
‘ they are instead frustrated that their seminars are too crowded , it takes too long to get an academic to resound to their academic work			0
‘ there are always individual students who are n’t focused and who are just dossing around			2
‘ but overall they are more serious - minded than ever			1
’ latest figures show an increase in the number of hours students spend working , albeit a modest one			2
mr @entity16 believes it is in part fuelled by students demanding value for money since tuition fees were increased to £ 9,000			1
the survey by the @entity60 of first and second year students found 29 per cent thought their course was poor value for money			2
‘ universities do need to do more to raise the quality of the academic experience , mr @entity16 said			1
universities minister @entity16 told @entity1 students are now ' more serious - minded ' ‘ the student experience in @entity71 universities has not been good enough and at last it is beginning to improve			1
’ the minister points out that in extreme cases the worst universities could end up in court for breach of contract			1
‘ the structure of fees , although they do n’t pay the fees upfront , has given them a real claim on the universities , ’ mr @entity16 said			1
‘ students do have rights : ultimately universities have to provide them with up to £ 9,000 of education			1
’ and if they do n’t , the universities could find themselves being sued			2
‘ ultimately there is a legal contract for the university to deliver services			0
that does n’t mean we want lots of people pursuing universities through the courts			2
‘ but there is this body , the @entity102 , which will try to resolve student complaints if they ca n’t be done through the university			0
’ more than 20,000 students complained to their universities last year , a 10 per cent rise on 2010 - 11			1
@entity108 of the complaints are class sizes and lecturers taking too long to respond to questions and mark essays			0
latest figures show that students attend more than 9 out of 10 lectures , and most of those they miss are because they do not think they are worth their time			1
bright teenage girls should not fixate on becoming doctors because there are not enough places to study medicine , @entity16 warned			1
the universities minister said limits on places based on @entity128 demand for staff meant courses were always oversubscribed			1
he highlighted the problem of students , especially girls , only studying a-levels needed for medicine such as chemistry and biology			0
' the subject which is most oversubscribed where people are sadly least likely to get to fulfil their ambition is medicine , ' mr @entity16 said			2
' within that it is particularly girls applying for medicine			0
' if they have given up physics at gsce despite perhaps having got a good gcse because it ’s medicine that they are thinking of , it is hard for them to move across and convert to doing another form of science or engineering			0
' they are all interested in science but it is medicine they are untested in so they do n’t need physics for medicine so they drop the physics			0
' there are lots of other ways of doing science which also make the world a better place , and not place all your bets on the medical option			0
' first and second year students on average had 14.2 hours of time - tabled sessions scheduled and attended 12.9 hours			2
asked why they missed lectures , half said they did not find them ' very useful ' and 41 per cent said they did not need to attend because they could find the notes online			0
just 31 per cent of those who missed sessions said they ' could n't be bothered to attend '			0
some students are now so fed up with the quality of their courses they have carried out analysis of the amount - and quality - of the tuition they receive to see if they are getting their money ’s worth			1
in 2010 , the coalition controversially trebled the maximum amount universe is can charge in tuition fees to £ 9,000			1
to date there has been little impact on the numbers of people still wanting to go to university - in part because they only start paying it back after starting work and earning more than £ 21,000			2
@entity206 students in @entity207 are demanding fewer multiple choice exams - which are easier to mark - and more open - ended essays which will take more time for their lecturers to assess			1
some 35 per cent of students surveyed said it took more than three weeks to have an assignment marked and returned to them while a quarter complained about not always getting prompt feedback			0
overall 87 per cent said they were satisfied with the quality of their course , but 13 per cent were dissatisfied mr @entity16 added : ‘ i think increasingly students are more serious minded			1
there is a slow and modest rise , but nevertheless the trend is the amount of hours of academic work done by students appears to be going up			0
‘ talk to a student union and you are as likely to get complaints about how long it takes to get an essay back with a mark and feedback from an academic than anything about wider politics			0
‘ so yeah i think they are more serious			0
’ despite the rise in fees , he insists it is still worth going to university			0
according to the latest @entity246 , the average salary for graduates with one degree is £ 32,000 , compared to £ 20,000 for non-graduates			2
‘ that kind of brings home in a vivid way the scale of the gap , ’ mr @entity16 added			2
‘ individuals will obviously decide for themselves			0
it is not the right thing for every individual			0
but overall yes it is the right thing			0
