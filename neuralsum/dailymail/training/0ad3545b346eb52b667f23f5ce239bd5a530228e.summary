by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:31 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 10 october 2013 tough : home secretary @entity2 will push ahead with plans to ' deport first and hear an appeal later ' banks will be forced to carry out background checks to stop illegal immigrants opening accounts			1
the proposal – one of several in the long - awaited @entity11 – would force managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally			1
applicants for a driving licence would also have to prove they were in @entity19 legally			1
those who are unable to do so would be turned down			0
ministers said the law would stop illegal immigrants using public services and discourage them from coming to @entity19 in the first place			1
the stricter rules follow elements of the @entity11 already announced , such as requiring private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants			2
temporary migrants , such as foreign students , would also have to make a contribution to the @entity32 before they could use @entity33 and hospital services , following concerns about the cost of health tourism to the taxpayer			0
however , ministers are thought to have dropped a proposal to make gps check the immigration status of new patients			2
home secretary @entity2 will push ahead with plans to ‘ deport first and hear an appeal later ’ in cases involving foreign criminals , terrorists and illegal immigrants			1
mrs may told @entity50 : ' i think most members of the public - if you ’re working hard - you want to know that people who are being given access to rented accommodation to various other public services , to things like bank accounts and driving licences , you want to say " well , hang on a minute - if they ’re here illegally , if they have no right to be here in the @entity19 , why is it that people are able to have access to these things ? "			1
' surely the government should do something about it , and that is exactly what we ’re doing			0
' she went on : ' crucially , in the @entity11 what we ’ll be doing is addressing the issue that people get fed up when they feel that people are able to come into the country and access the health service without having contributed to it			0
' so we will be asking for a surcharge - there ’ll be a sort of levy on people who are going to be coming here to be staying for a while to contribute so that people can feel it ’s fair that actually people are being asked to contribute to public services such as the @entity32			1
' the proposal would force bank managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally the shake - up of immigration law will let the government remove dangerous migrants from the country while their cases proceed instead of having to let them remain in @entity19 for years during their appeal			1
in addition , the list of grounds for appeal will be slashed from 17 to just four			0
this is a response to the debacle of the deportation of @entity113 , who was flown home to @entity115 in july after a 12 - year legal battle			0
it is expected to cut the 68,000 cases lodged against the government every year by more than half			0
the @entity11 will also : immigration minister @entity121 said : ‘ the @entity122 will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled , reduce the factors which encourage people to come to the @entity19 and make it easier to remove people who should not be here			1
‘ we welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society			0
‘ hard - working people deserve an immigration system that is fair to @entity19 citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law			2
’ net migration has been cut by a third since 2010 but ministers fear a voter backlash if thousands of @entity143 and @entity144 come to @entity19 when border controls end in 2014			2
@entity146 , @entity147 's shadow immigration minister , said : ' @entity2 has a history of promising big and pretending all is well , but the government is continuing to fail on immigration policy			0
' this government is still failing on immigration even on its own measures , with net migration now going up again rather than being in the tens of thousands as the prime minister promised			0

the proposal is one of several in the long - awaited @entity11
driving licence applicants would have to prove they were in @entity19 legally
ministers say the law would stop illegal immigrants using public services
it may also discourage them from coming to @entity19 in the first place

*restrict* the right of immigration *detainees* behind bars to apply *repeatedly* for bail ,
