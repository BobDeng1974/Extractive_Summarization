by @entity0 and @entity1 this is the first picture of the 11 - year - old boy whose parents have been arrested on suspicion of neglect and child cruelty after allowing his weight to balloon to 15st			1
the couple , from @entity9 , @entity10 were caught out when they met with social workers with the explicit intent of trying to get a wet room installed at home - but were investigated			1
they claim that teachers encouraged them to contact a social worker for the state - of - the - art wet room which would have cost over £ 2000 as a trick to make authorities drop in			1
overweight : this is the 11 - year - old boy whose parents allowed him to balloon to 15 stone - but blamed genetics according to @entity30 police stepped in after doctors raised concerns about the boy ’s welfare following two visits to hospital earlier this year			1
yesterday the parents admitted that they called their obese son ‘ @entity39 ’ because of his size – but blamed genetics rather than his diet and lifestyle			1
both parents have been arrested on child cruelty charges and been bailed			1
however his mum is adamant that the wet room would have made life easier for them as their son had refused to go upstairs - but it led child protection services to show up a month later			1
following a meeting with social workers this week , the couple have agreed to a letter of intent over the boy ’s care outlining what they will do to help him lose weight			1
if they fail to stick to the terms , legal proceedings will be started to take the boy into care			0
the 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 – close to double the healthy level			0
according to the @entity77 ’s online @entity76 calculator , the healthy weight range for his age and height is from 6st 14lb to 9st 7lb			2
a social services report is said to record that he fell over during a school swimming session and was unable to stand up by himself			2
it also details admissions to teachers that the boy – who is supposed to be on a strict diet – had eaten takeaways and been to a milkshake parlour			2
the boy ’s 20st father said yesterday : ‘ my son ’s always been big			2
he was born with shovels for hands and spades for feet			0
everyone on my side of the family is big			0
‘ there ’s nothing we can do about it			0
i only eat occasional kebabs			0
our son ’s favourite snack is steamed broccoli – and he ’s still big			0
’ the father , 49 , and his unemployed wife , 43 , told @entity30 they try to encourage their son to play sport by giving him toy guns to fire in their garden at home			0
he also plays regularly on his @entity113 , a computer games console in which players depend on physical movements to control actions on the screen			0
the couple had signed up to a voluntary plan to tackle the boy ’s weight when they were threatened with legal action earlier this year , but it brought no improvement			2
concerns were raised by teachers at the specialist school he attends for help with autism , and the parents agreed to see a social worker			1
the 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 - close to double the healthy level - but the @entity77 's online @entity76 calculator , the healthy weight range for his age and height is between 6st 14lb and 9st 7lbs ( file picture ) but doctors at the boy ’s local hospital called police after he was twice admitted for treatment in march , and officers then visited the family ’s home			1
the boy ’s mother , who describes herself as ‘ chubby ’ , said the family were trying their best to help him			0
‘ the idea they could take away my son scares me so much , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m nothing without my kids			0
his weight is n’t that much of a big deal … it ’s genetics – you can be genetically fat			1
’ police said it would be ‘ inappropriate ’ to comment on the case , but added that a child ’s welfare was ‘ paramount ’ in such situations and that officers only intervened when ‘ other attempts to protect the child have been unsuccessful ’			2
