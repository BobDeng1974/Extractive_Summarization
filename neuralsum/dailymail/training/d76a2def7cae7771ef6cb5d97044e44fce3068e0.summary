by @entity0 astronomers believe they have found the sun ’s ‘ long - lost brother ’ – a stellar body born from the same gas cloud as our own star			1
the researchers claim there is even a ‘ small ’ chance that this solar sibling could host planets that harbour life			2
but even if its solar system proves barren , the discovery could help scientists find other stellar twins that may help shed light on how our sun formed			1
the @entity22 says the star , called @entity24 , is 15 per cent more massive than our sun and located 110 light - years away in the constellation @entity26			1
the star is not visible to the unaided eye , but easily can be seen with low - power binoculars , not far from the bright star @entity31 the sun ’s ‘ long - lost brother ' is a star called hd 162826			1
it is a star 15 per cent more massive than the sun , located 110 light - years away in the constellation @entity26			1
the star is not visible to the unaided eye , but can be seen with low - power binoculars , not far from the bright star @entity31			1
‘ we want to know where we were born , ’ professor @entity40 from the @entity22 said			2
‘ if we can figure out in what part of the galaxy the sun formed , we can constrain conditions on the early solar system			1
that could help us understand why we are here			0
’ in their earliest days , collisions could have knocked chunks off of planets , and these fragments could have travelled between solar systems			0
these may have been responsible for bringing primitive life to @entity55			2
or , fragments from @entity55 could have transported life to planets orbiting solar siblings			2
scientists believe the stellar body was born from the same gas cloud as our own sun ( pictured )			1
the researchers claim there is a ' small ' chance that this solar sibling could host planets that harbour life @entity71 ’s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the @entity73			2
it will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1 % of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home @entity80 to help answer questions about its origin and evolution			0
repeatedly scanning the sky , @entity71 will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years			2
in addition to positions and motions , @entity71 will also measure key physical properties of each star , including its brightness , temperature and chemical composition			2
eventually , the @entity71 data archive will exceed a million @entity101 , equivalent to about 200 000 dvds of data			0
‘ so it could be argued that solar siblings are key candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life , ’ professor @entity40 said			0
the solar sibling his team identified is a star called @entity24 , a star 15 per cent more massive than the sun , located 110 light - years away in the constellation @entity26			1
the star is not visible to the unaided eye , but easily can be seen with low - power binoculars , not far from the bright star @entity31			1
while the finding of a single solar sibling is intriguing , professor @entity40 points out that the project has a larger purpose : to create a road map for how to identify solar siblings , in preparation for the flood of data expected soon from surveys like @entity71			0
‘ the idea is that the sun was born in a cluster with a thousand or a hundred thousand stars			1
' this cluster , which formed more than 4.5 billion years ago , has since broken up , ’ he said			1
the member stars have broken off into their own orbits around the galactic center , taking them to different parts of the @entity73 today			0
a few , like @entity24 , are still nearby			1
others are much farther afield			0
the data coming soon from @entity71 is ‘ not going to be limited to the solar neighborhood , ’ professor @entity40 said			0
‘ the number of stars that we can study will increase by a factor of 10,000 , ’ he said the project hopes to create a road map for how to identify solar siblings , in preparation for the flood of data expected soon from surveys like @entity71			0
pictured is the young star cluster @entity156 taken as part of calibration and testing before the science phase of the @entity71 telescope mission begins he says his team ’s road map will speed up the process of winnowing down the field of potential solar siblings			0
' do n’t invest a lot of time in analyzing every detail in every star , ' he said			0
' you can concentrate on certain key chemical elements that are going to be very useful			0
' these elements are ones that vary greatly among stars , which otherwise have very similar chemical compositions , and are largely dependent on where in the galaxy the star formed			2
@entity40 ’s team has identified the elements barium and yttrium as particularly useful			0
once many more solar siblings have been identified , astronomers will be one step closer to knowing where and how the sun formed			1
to reach that goal , the dynamics specialists will make models that run the orbits of all known solar siblings backward in time to find where they intersect : their birthplace .			0

the star , named @entity24 , is 15 per cent more massive than our sun
scientists believe it was born from the same gas cloud as our own star

as well as helping find alien life , star could shed light on how sun formed
