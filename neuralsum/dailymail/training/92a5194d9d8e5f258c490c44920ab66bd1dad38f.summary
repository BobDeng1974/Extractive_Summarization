by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:14 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 21 october 2013 senior judge : @entity4 said it was ' not appropriate ' to hand out a whole life sentence a senior judge who refused to sentence a triple killer to die in prison because of his human rights found himself on a collision course with the government last night			1
@entity13 , 55 , butchered @entity14 , 66 , while on day release in july from an earlier jail term for murder			1
but mr @entity18 yesterday said it was ‘ not appropriate ’ to hand out a whole life sentence because of a @entity21 ( @entity23 ) decision earlier this year			2
the judge also indicated that a second killer in an unrelated case , @entity27 extremist @entity25 , who yesterday admitted murdering an elderly @entity30 man , would not be given a whole life term when he is sentenced on friday			1
his comments ignited a row over who decides sentencing policy , and sparked a rebuke from justice secretary @entity39 , who said the public expected whole life tariffs for the most serious offenders			0
mr @entity39 , who is also @entity43 , said : ‘ the domestic law on this has not changed			0
we are considering the government ’s response to the @entity23 ’s recent ruling , but this in no way alters that fact and courts should continue to impose whole life tariffs where they wish to do so			2
’ @entity57 sources suggested the judge had ‘ got it wrong ’ by following the letter of the @entity62 ruling before it had been considered by ministers and @entity64			0
in july , the @entity62 court said ‘ life means life ’ sentences were a breach of @entity70 , the protection against inhuman and degrading treatment			2
terrible crime : double murderer @entity73 , above left , has admitted killing @entity14 , 66 who had gone to help his neighbour victim : convicted paedophile @entity78 's screams for help were heard by mr @entity14 , who then lost his life intervening in a robbery at the time , mr @entity39 said the ruling was a ‘ terrible day for @entity84 justice ’			1
following the judgment , ministers were given six months to decide how they will respond			0
last night @entity88 mp @entity87 said : ‘ a toxic mix of @entity62 case - law and the @entity91 is infecting our court system , with the result that dangerous murderers are being given the chance of release , when we should be locking them up and throwing away the key			0
’ @entity13 killed mr @entity14 on the first day he was eligible for day release during a 25 - year sentence for murder			1
mr @entity14 intervened to stop him robbing his vulnerable elderly neighbour in their @entity103 village			1
@entity13 had already served a long sentence for manslaughter after a hammer attack on a gay man almost 30 years ago			0
sentencing him at the @entity110 to life in prison , with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 40 years , the judge said : ‘ it is incumbent on me to pass a sentence that is compliant with the @entity23 [ on human rights ] if i can and it is not appropriate to impose a whole life term			1
’ family man : @entity14 , 66 , who died in the latest killing , is circled in a family photo heartbroken : @entity122 , pictured reading a statement outside the @entity110 , said her life had been ' turned upside down ' by her husband 's murder the @entity21 ruled in july that life sentences with no possibility of review are inhumane and degrading			1
the whole - life tariff applied in the @entity84 to just 48 men and one woman – @entity133 – whose crimes courts regard as so heinous they must never be let out			1
but three of them – @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 – appealed to @entity139 , saying their sentences ‘ undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit ’			0
and the highest body of the @entity21 , the @entity21 , agreed with them			0
it said refusing the 49 any prospect of release amounted to a breach of @entity70 of the @entity23 , which prohibits torture , and ' inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment '			0
all the killers must now be allowed a review – with the prospect of release if they have been ‘ rehabilitated ’ and are deemed harmless			0
and today the full impact of this ruling was felt as mr @entity18 said that he was barred from passing a whole life term on triple murderer @entity13 because of it			1
the judge instead ordered that @entity162 serve a minimum of 40 years in prison			1
it is believed to be the first time that a multiple killer has escaped a whole life term because of the @entity139 ruling			2
the horror attack took place within hours of @entity13 hitching a lift from @entity173 , near @entity174 , on saturday , july 13 , while on unsupervised day release from a 25 - year sentence for stabbing his landlord to death			1
he went straight to the house of @entity182 , 87 , an @entity183 he met in prison two years earlier while @entity182 was serving a 30 - month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten - year - old boy			2
as @entity13 filled a pillowcase with family heirlooms and cash , his victim shouted for help from a window			0
mr @entity14 came over to investigate and was confronted by @entity13 , who dragged him inside the house and slashed his throat			2
mr @entity14 ’s wife @entity122 , 55 , a nurse , said : ‘ to kill him was the most senseless , vicious act of violence and cowardice possible			0
his family and friends will never be able to make sense of what happened			0
’ in 1984 , @entity13 was jailed for ten years for manslaughter after he killed @entity205 , 49			1
in 1992 , he was jailed for life , with the recommendation that he served 25 years , after stabbing @entity208 to death			2
this was later reduced to a 14 - year minimum term			0
last night the attorney general ’s office said the sentence handed to @entity13 had been referred for review on the grounds it was ‘ unduly lenient ’			0
forensics officers working at @entity182 's stone house in the village of @entity220 , @entity103 tragic : much loved mr @entity14 rushed from his home ( pictured on the day he died ) to help a neighbour in need			1

@entity13 , 55 , stabbed to death @entity14 in july after going on run
jailed for life again today and must serve minimum of 40 years in prison
*pensioner* died after rushing to help neighbour when he heard screams
@entity236 was robbing @entity237 at home , having met him in jail
@entity13 has killed 3 men since 1984 but still not given whole - life term
judge : ' whole life order would breach *article* 3 of the @entity23 '
