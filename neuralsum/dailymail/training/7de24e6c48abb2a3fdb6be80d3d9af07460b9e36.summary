by @entity0 have you ever wondered how tiny chihuahua can be related to a rottweiler or a pit bull terrier can be similar to a dalmatian ? one artist has created a dog family tree that highlights the diversity of dogs and how breeds are interconnected			1
from terriers to toys and mountain dogs to sight hounds , it delineates almost every standard pure - breed dog so you can see how one canine is connected to another			1
for example , the chart shows that a chihuahua – the smallest breed of dog that heralds from @entity44 – can be easily linked to rottweilers , which are popularly known to make good – and sometimes ferocious – guard dogs			1
according to the chart , chihuahuas are part of the toy group and are closely related to toy pinchers , which are in turn linked to pinchers and then common guard dogs such as the rotweiller			2
in the similar way , the giant saint bernard is related to the little pug via the working dogs group , then common guard dogs group , followed by the pincher and toy pincer groups , which then link to the ' toy ' dogs of which the pug is a member			1
from terriers to toys - such as pugs , pomeranians and shih tzus ( pictured in this portion of the chart ) - and mountain dogs to sight hounds , the dog family tree delineates almost every standard pure - breed dog so you can see how one dog is connected to another it might seem incredible that dogs with such different visible characteristics – from their size to their type of hair – can be so different , but it is because all dogs are members of the same species – canis lupus familiaris			1
their genetic code is relatively simple compared to other species and is therefore easily adaptable as drastic changes - such as the type of hair or ears – is controlled by a single genetic variation			2
the family tree makes it easy to see which dogs belong to the same ‘ family ’ groups			1
for instance , groups of dogs such as setters , pointers , spaniels and retrievers belong to the ‘ sporting dogs ’ group , as well as individual breeds including the vizsla and wirehaired pointing griffon			1
the chart shows that a chihuahua – the smallest breed of dog that heralds from @entity44 ( pictured , left ) – can be easily linked to rotweillers ( right ) , which are popularly known to make good – and sometimes ferocious – guard dogs			2
chihuahuas are part of the toy group and are closely related to toy pinchers , which are in turn linked to pinchers and then common guard dogs such as the @entity129 the chart features 181 dog breeds from tiny ' toy ' animals like the pug and the fluffy pomeranian to working dogs like the alaskan malamutes and family favourites such as golden retrievers and @entity140 , which are pictured in this portion of the family tree dalmatians are relatively closely related to a number of unlikely breeds			1
according to the chart , the spotty dogs are closely linked to the diminutive @entity149 bulldog and candy - floss like bichon frise			2
the ‘ diagram of dogs ’ is for sale as a limited edition print and @entity154 , the company selling it , said : ‘ dog lovers of every preference are sure to spot their favourite canine compadre in this pedigreed presentation of man 's best friends - a taxonomical treat that 's best in show			2
’ according to a study published earlier this year , dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor between 11,000 and 34,000 years ago			0
it might seem incredible that dogs with such different visible characteristics - from their size to their type of hair - can be so different , but it is because all dogs are members of the same species - canis lupus familiaris			1
some of the largest types of dogs fall in the ' working dogs ' category , which is shown in this part of the dog family tree @entity186 scientists said that part of the genetic overlap observed between some modern dogs and wolves is the result of interbreeding after dog domestication and not a direct line of descent from one group of wolves			1
they believe their research reflects a more complicated history than the popular story that early farmers adopted a few docile , friendly wolves that later became our modern canine companions			0
instead , the earliest dogs may have first lived among hunter - gatherer societies and adapted to agricultural life later , according to the study			0
researchers from the @entity209 said that dogs are more closely related to each other than to wolves , regardless of geographic origin as they do not descend from a single line of wolves			0
some of the most popular dog breeds , including labradors and golden retrievers but it are shown in this portion of the chart , but it is easy to see how they are closely related to more ' exotic ' breeds such as the vizsla @entity143 ( pictured ) are relatively closely related to a number of unlikely breeds , according to the chart			1
they are closely linked to the diminutive french bulldog and candy - floss like bichon frise every breed of dog is a member of exactly the same species - canis lupus familiaris , regardless of its coat , shape or size			2
while some variation between breeds has occurred naturally , most of the very obvious differences are the direct result of human breeding			0
many dogs nowadays are bred for their aesthetic qualities but in the past there were more practical motivations behind human intervention in the gene pool			0
lots of dogs were raised to be the best possible hunters , such as the dachshund , which was bred to get in to badgers ' setts with their low , narrow entrances - hence its name , which means ' badger dog ' in @entity260			0
one possible reason dogs are so easily adaptable is because changing their genetic code is relatively simple compared to many other species			0
in human genes , for example , nearly every characteristic is governed by a complex network of genes , which work in combination to display certain outcomes			0
but with dogs , many quite drastic changes , such as fur type and ear shape , are controlled by a single genetic variation			0
in fact , a huge research project called @entity277 determined that every single biological difference affecting dogs ' appearance is controlled by one of around 50 gene variations			0
this simplicity is partly a result of the human activity which has tinkered with canine biology for thousands of years , and has therefore picked out the characteristics most easily changed by simple genes .			0
