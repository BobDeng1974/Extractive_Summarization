by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 14 august 2013 determined : home secretary @entity1 has staked her reputation on kicking foreign criminals like @entity4 out of @entity5 efforts to deport a @entity8 murderer have failed because judges have ruled it would be ' stressful ' for him to be returned to his home country			1
an immigration tribunal ruled that returning the man who moved to the @entity5 from @entity14 at the age of 13 would breach his right to family life under @entity18			1
instead it ruled that he should be allowed to stay in @entity5 indefinitely even though he stabbed a friend to death in what the immigration tribunal called an ' unprovoked attack			1
' tribunal judges also ruled that the man 's identity should be kept secret to protect him despite his criminal past and potential threat to the community			2
the 48 - year - old killer moved to @entity5 with his mother in 1978 as a young teenager when she got a job at the @entity8 embassy			1
twenty years later he took a knife from the family home and a stabbed a friend to death in a drink and drug fuelled attack			1
he admitted manslaughter at the @entity44 and was sent to to a secure mental health unit but was released into the community in 2008 after serving less than a decade for the killing			0
two years later he suffered a ' relapse ' and was returned to care			0
but in 2011 he was freed again and now lives in supported accommodation			0
now efforts by the @entity52 to deport him have been blocked because it was judged that he had lived in the @entity5 for too long to be expected to go home			1
the tribunal heard that as a result of his 36 years spent in @entity5 he had ' extinguished ' links with his home country and that the move would cause him ' stress			1
' it said : ' adjusting to life in @entity8 was likely to be a significant challenge for the appellant after 36 years in the @entity5 ' he was vulnerable to stress and the social impact of a move to @entity8 was likely to destabilise his illness			1
' the @entity52 appealed the decision to keep the killer 's identity secret but this too was rejected on the grounds that there was ' no evidence ' the man posed a risk to the public			2
hate : @entity82 suspect @entity4 represents one of the most infamous examples of criminals being protected by @entity87 legislation , it took eight years and almost £ 2million of legal fees to get him finally deported in july this year speaking yesterday a spokesman from the @entity52 confirmed they had no plans to further challenge the judgement but said : ' we do not routinely comment on individual cases			0
' the news comes just a month after it was revealed that police forces up and down the country are defying national guidelines and protecting the identity of prisoners			0
violent : @entity102 @entity101 pleaded guilty to stamping her husband to death and was jailed for two years but has been allowed to stay in the @entity5 more than half of forces in @entity107 and @entity108 do not publish mugshots of offenders unless they have been jailed because of concerns and about data protection and the criminals ’ human rights			1
this means that only a tiny proportion of the 1.2million convicted in criminal courts each year have their photos published			0
this despite the fact that it is widely acknowledged that publicity can link offenders to other crimes and even prevent more from being committed			0
in one well known case from 2007 @entity124 refused to release photographs of two murderers who had fled from an open prison			0
they argued that the pair were likely to have left the area and therefore posed no risk to residents so there was no need to identify them			0
pictures of @entity138 and @entity139 were eventually published by another force			0
in april this year the country 's most senior immigration judge ruled that a polish woman who killed her husband by repeatedly stamping on his head could not be deported from @entity5 because it would breach @entity146 rules			1
@entity147 , who arrived in the @entity5 in 2007 claimed she ' lost control ' when she returned home to find her alcoholic husband drunk when he was supposed to be caring for their three - year - old son			1
mr @entity153 died from blunt force trauma to the head in 2009 after his wife repeatedly stamped on his face and neck , breaking his nose and spattering her own clothing with his blood			0
chief constable of @entity124 , @entity163 , believed pictures of escaped murderers should not be published because it was likely they had left the county and did not pose a risk to locals she pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for two years.last year she was assessed as posing a ' medium risk ' of @entity173 mr @entity172 ruled that she could stay in @entity5 because her crime did not cross a ' seriousness threshold ' under @entity178 law on the grounds that @entity146 citizens can only be ordered out of the country if they have committed crimes in ' exceptional circumstances			2
last month the home secretary @entity1 may finally won her battle to deport @entity186 hate preacher @entity4 after an eight year legal fight that cost @entity5 taxpayers around £ 1.7million			2
the costs , revealed in a letter by miss may to the @entity192 in june included @entity194 's legal aid costs of £ 647,658			0
@entity194 – once dubbed @entity196 ’s right hand man in @entity178 – lost his appeal against deportation in 2007 but has repeatedly used human rights laws to thwart his removal to face terrorism charges in his homeland			1
miss may on the other hand staked her reputation on being the home secretary that would eventually get rid of him			2
she finally secured his deportation by signing a fair trial guarantee treaty with @entity186 in march and after more legal wrangling he was flown home from @entity212 in july .			2

killer moved to @entity5 at 13 when his mother got a job in the @entity8 embassy
he stabbed his friend to death with a knife *stolen* from family home in 1998
but judges ruled that sending him home would violate his human rights
