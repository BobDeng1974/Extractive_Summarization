a pair of music - loving bartenders have invented a piano capable of mixing a range of cocktails @entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , have created a ' @entity11 ' that can mix up to five different types of drink , including @entity14 and @entity15 the pair have designed the instrument to make complicated concoctions with each drink represented by a different piece of music when pianist @entity36 , 26 , starts playing , the ingredients are mixed together and served up in a bowl			1
ms @entity7 , 27 , said : ' the operating principle is rather simple ; when you hit a key it triggers an impulse which makes the beverage flow from a certain container , mix on a chute , drop in a bowl and creates the cocktail for the specific piece of music			1
' so , when for example , @entity36 plays @entity51 's @entity50 , the piano makes a @entity15			1
' ms @entity8 , also 27 , added : ' the idea came from reading a book by @entity56 author @entity55 called @entity11			2
' there 's a scene in the book where a piano makes cocktails , with every song having a different flavour and i thought it would be great to be able to taste a melody			1
' @entity8 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) say they want to expand the number of drinks it can make when the pianist hits certain keys it triggers a device which makes the drink flow from its container before the liquid drains off into a mixing bowl the duo , who are both 27 - years - old , have now applied to have their musical invention registered now the pair , who are taking their cocktail - making piano around the capital , say they want to expand the number of drinks it can make			1
ms @entity7 said : ' at the moment it can only make five , but in the future we want to be able to do more , which will mean not only more drinks but more songs too			0
' so far their piano cocktail is proving a hit			0
pub - goer @entity99 , 25 , said : ' it 's pretty cool although it does take a bit of time to get your drink			0

' the duo have now applied to have their invention registered .			0
