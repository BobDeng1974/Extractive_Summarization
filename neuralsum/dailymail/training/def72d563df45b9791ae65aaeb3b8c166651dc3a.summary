the team formerly known as @entity1 have taken a step closer to appearing on the @entity4 grid this season			1
@entity1 went into administration towards the end of last season , missing the final three grands prix of the campaign in the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
behind the scenes talks have continually taken place in the hope the team , down on the @entity20 entry list for this year as @entity21 , would emerge from the ashes of its demise			2
@entity1 could emerge as a side named @entity21 and compete in the new @entity4 season @entity1 did not compete in the final three races last season due to their financial difficulties last month those hopes were raised slightly when a planned auction of @entity1 's assets was cancelled to allow for discussions to continue with a third party			1
those discussions remain ongoing and appear to be drawing towards a fruitful conclusion that would see the team compete this year , albeit using the 2014 car			0
crucially , it is planned for @entity1 to exit administration on february 19 via a @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , which is a key positive move towards salvation			2
from there the team could then plan for the opening race of the year on march 15 in @entity47			0
@entity48 , joint administrator , and partner at @entity50 , said : ' since the appointment of administrators negotiations have taken place with a number of parties to try and secure a long - term solution for the team			0
' we can confirm that negotiations continue towards a longer term viable solution for the business and participation of a team in the 2015 season			0
' it is envisaged that , prior to the commencement of the first race of the 2015 season , investment into the business will be made upon the company exiting from administration via a @entity40 , which is planned for 19 february 2015			1
the emergence of @entity21 in place of @entity1 means a side could race in the new @entity4 season ' a cva is a restructuring process agreed with the company 's creditors which allows for a turnaround of the business and the creation of a longer term viable solution for the team			1
' given the confidential nature of the negotiations underway we are unable to provide further details			0
' the joint administrators would like , on behalf of @entity88 , to thank all involved with the team for their support during this process			0

@entity1 went into administration at the end of last season 's @entity4
they missed the last three races in the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13
but they could now emerge as @entity21 and race in the 2015 campaign
