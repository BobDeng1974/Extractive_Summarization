@entity0 has spoken of his fear that his all - conquering @entity3 side will experience burn - out as they seek to add the @entity5 to the @entity6 they lifted in @entity7 back in july			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 will sit out their country ’s clash with @entity14 in @entity15 on wednesday evening – although only the latter remains a doubt for the @entity19 curtain - raiser with @entity20 in @entity21 on sunday			1
just 52 days after watching @entity22 lift the game ’s biggest prize in @entity25 , @entity0 is deeply concerned that a lack of proper rest for his star performers coupled with the demands of elite club football will adversely affect their chances of a smooth qualification passage			1
and @entity0 – who has named @entity33 as his long - term skipper despite the @entity36 man also being currently sidelined – intends to counter the burn - out issue throughout the qualifiers by drip - feeding uncapped players into his squad			1
fears : @entity42 coach @entity0 is worried his @entity42 players risk burn - out ahead of @entity19 management : low intends to blood uncapped players throughout @entity48 qualifying to restrict their workloads ‘ it ’s exciting that the @entity51 has just begun but it ’s clear there is a @entity6 aftermath – the effect of playing lots of games in such a short period of time , ’ he said			1
‘ many players need more rest			1
@entity62 have approached the season with knocks and problems that they probably inherited from the @entity6			1
‘ that will be a factor in the next few weeks and months			0
‘ it will be difficult for me and the @entity51 coaches to bring all the players in their squads up to the same level			2
‘ we respect the qualifying system			2
but we have many young players trying to get into the squad , like @entity78 ( of @entity21 )			0
‘ we have to give these players an opportunity when the established ones are ruled out for whatever reason			0
‘ so we definitely need this qualifying process to take the up and coming players by the hand – and allow them to be blooded for the highest level			2
‘ look at @entity87 , for example			0
we might need to leave him out if he ’s irreplaceable for @entity89			0
i have to accept that because sometimes @entity6 tournaments can affect players ’ stamina and physical condition			1
‘ it ’s difficult for them to have just three weeks ’ holiday and then go into pre-season training			0
they ’ve been thrown into the deep end again very quickly			0
out of action : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) are among @entity42 stars out of action this week ‘ so it ’s likely that they ’ll fall into a “ performance hole ” and suffer a little crisis			1
that ’s when other players have to step up to the mark			0
‘ for the established players , it ’s been very hard for them to get back to normal in the @entity51 so i need potential candidates in my squad to fill their positions			0
’ @entity0 ’s immediate thoughts are with a rematch against the nation they defeated in @entity25 to lift their fourth world title			2
but , with the more meaningful game against @entity123 ’s side lying around the corner , he admitted the @entity125 would not have been the team of choice to face in the first competitive game since the triumph in @entity7			0
‘ @entity20 is the kind of team @entity42 have always struggled against , ’ he added			1
‘ with @entity20 ’s sheer commitment and their running – they are a team who never give up no matter what the score is – then they are difficult opponents			2
tight unit : low and his now captain @entity33 will lead the next wave of @entity42 players ‘ their fans get right behind them and drive them on			1
‘ if you look at this group and the likes of @entity20 and @entity149 , they come across as similar teams			2
‘ they have similar playing styles , who excel for their passion and the physicality of their football			0
‘ we know this group is anything but easy because all the teams will try as hard as they can to make life difficult for us			0
‘ the likes of @entity20 have not been at the last few tournaments so they will give their all to be at the next @entity5			2
’ while the focus must now be on the @entity164 , @entity0 feels drawing a psychological line under what went on in @entity167 may prove easier said than done			2
‘ it ’s nothing that comes automatically and it ’s almost impossible to tell players to forget the @entity6 , ’ he conceded			1
last time out : now - retired captain @entity22 holds the @entity6 trophy aloft in @entity25 ‘ it ’s difficult for players to motivate themselves and be fully aware of the situation			1
‘ it wo n’t be easy but we want to win the game on sunday			0
‘ despite the fact we have some players missing we still have enough quality to beat opponents such as @entity20			1
‘ but , that said , it wo n’t be easy over the next few months			0
‘ we wo n’t have players playing at the same level because some will have personal ups and downs , physical difficulties			0
‘ their bodies will demand a longer period of rest , so things will be different in the months ahead			2
‘ the players will be robbed of physical strength because of the @entity6			1
@entity25 was really great but the message has to be – let ’s now focus on @entity197 2016			0
that cycle begins with the match against @entity20 on sunday			1
’ it 's not too late to play @entity201 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity0 is worried his @entity42 stars will burn out ahead of @entity19
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 among players who will miss their *friendly* @entity6 final replay against @entity14 on wednesday
