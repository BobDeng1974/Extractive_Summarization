with @entity1 just a few weeks away , chocolate may be among the treats @entity3 plans to give up for the religious fasting			1
so he may want to start tucking into this chocolate gift now - a life - sized version of himself moulded out of 1.5tons of @entity9 from @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the @entity3 was presented with the unique chocolate statue of himself in the @entity14 by a group of 20 amateurs chocolatiers yesterday			1
just in time for @entity1 : pope @entity3 is presented with a life - sized chocolate statue of himself at the @entity14 students on a course at the @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity22 , spent four weeks creating the chocolate statue in the @entity3 's image			1
the students picked the @entity3 as the person they wanted to make out of chocolate because of his popularity since he was elected the @entity29 in march last year			1
chocolate pope : the statue was made by amateur chocolatiers with 1.5 tons of cocoa from @entity10 in @entity11 but the @entity3 's simple tastes in food is well documented , so it is unlikely he will try a piece of his chocolate statue			1
hailing from @entity39 , a middle - class neighborhood in @entity41 , @entity3 grew up in a city famous for its meaty cuisine			1
but he is said to favour frugal , healthy meals made up up fruit , salads and skinless chicken			2
while he admits to occasionally indulging in an espresso or a glass of wine , but he rarely eats any rich foods			2
so perhaps the statue will end up raising money for charity - much like the @entity3 's former @entity54 which sold for £ 200,000 at auction yesterday			1
the head of the @entity57 decided to auction off the @entity59 bike and donate the funds to @entity61 , a charity which supports those in need around the world			0
the 1,585cc @entity54 went under the hammer yesterday at @entity68 ' @entity67 auction with an estimate of just £ 10,000			0
but the prospect of owning a bike belonging to the @entity3 became too much for many , sending bidding through the roof			1
potential buyers in the room , on the phone and online battled it out for the bike , with offers soon crossing the 100,000 euro ( £ 83,000 ) mark			0
bids continued to come with an online customer winning the auction , paying a staggering 210,000 euros ( £ 175,000 )			0
premiums took the final price to £ 200,976			0
pope @entity3 looks at a @entity54 motorcycle in june 2013 pope @entity3 helped raised more than £ 200,000 for charity yesterday by selling his signed @entity54			1
the head of the @entity57 does n't get much time to cruise around the streets of @entity91 on the @entity59 bike			0
so he decided to auction it off and donate the funds to @entity61 , a charity which supports those in need around the world			0

next up came the @entity3 's biker jacket , which sold for a staggering £ 47,851 - bringing his charity sales to almost £ 250,000			2
the staggering sale had similarities to when a @entity122 casino owner paid £ 127,000 for @entity3 @entity124 's @entity123 in 2005			2
all for a good cause : a @entity126 donated to @entity3 last year has sold for a staggering £ 200,000 at auction			2
