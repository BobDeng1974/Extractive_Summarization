by @entity1 correspondent whatever you do , do n’t try this at home			0
while the @entity5 might think it ’s a bright @entity7 idea , sawing the top off an old rusty gas canister to create a custom - made light fitting just happens to be illegal - and highly dangerous ... and potentially fatal			1
renovators @entity12 and @entity13 ’s idea was described as ‘ a fantastic example of homespun creativity ’ on @entity17 show @entity18			1
the canister was owned by gas company @entity20 , which yesterday condemned the programme , broadcast at 8pm on wednesday october 2			1
by law , all empty canisters must be disposed of by qualified technicians			0
the programme gained an audience of 1.9million people who watched tv architect @entity37 encourage the couple to salvage junk from their @entity41 farmyard and put it to use indoors			0
the pair were trying to build a new home for under £ 100,000 to replace their crumbling farmhouse , and were understandably glad to save on the cost of expensive light fittings			2
mr @entity13 was soon seen enthusiastically chopping the top off a large gas canister with a circular saw , sending sparks flying around his feet			1
@entity20 said residue gas in the canister can explode when the metal is cut and branded @entity5 ' irresponsible ' he later proudly showed off his new improvised light shades to the tv cameras			1
as the show ’s narrator said : ‘ their low - cost solutions are a fantastic examples of homespun creativity and @entity13 ’s prized cylinder lights are a great statement			2
’ ‘ we ca n’t believe the @entity5 and @entity66 would be so irresponsible			1
i hope their insurance is good			0
this is n’t so much diy , more dyi – do yourself in ' - @entity20 spokesman but it seems nobody in the programme - produced by independent company @entity66 - realised just how close mr @entity13 came to a nasty accident			1
experts said sawing canisters is potentially lethal as residue gas can be ignited by sparks caused by cutting the metal			1
last year , a 48 - year - old man from @entity84 was killed when he tried to turn an old gas cylinder into a barbecue			2
it exploded as he used an angle - grinder to cut open the 40 - gallon drum			2
in 2011 , the @entity90 fined a building company £ 2,000 after an employee suffered extensive burns while cutting open an empty canister			0
spokesman @entity96 said : ‘ not only is sawing open a gas canister unlawful , it is also highly dangerous			2
‘ decommissioning one of our gas canisters is an extremely hazardous process which should only be carried out by qualified technicians , in specialist facilities and by the bottled gas company that always own the cylinder - in this case @entity20			1
the custom - made lampshade			0
the @entity5 has since removed the segment from repeats of the show ‘ given that someone killed themselves last year trying to convert an oil drum into a bbq , the chances of someone getting hurt , indeed fatally , are extremely high			1
‘ we ca n’t believe the @entity5 and @entity66 would be so irresponsible			2
i hope their insurance is good			0
‘ this is n’t so much diy , more dyi – do yourself in			0
’ after it was alerted to the dangerous segment the @entity5 removed it from last week ’s episode			1
a spokesman for the programme said : ‘ the episode of october 2 , 2013 , with @entity13 and @entity12 featured a short section on the reuse of gas cylinders			0
cautionary lines were included in the programme warning viewers that any modification of found objects needs to be carried out safely			0
‘ as soon as we were made aware that the cylinders remained the property of the gas company the programme was taken down from the @entity143			0
we have also amended the programme for any further repeat			0
