' we 're normally busy turning @entity93 cans , @entity94 , @entity96 catalogues , posters and magazines interactive for our clients , but this time we wanted to do something for us and our fellow @entity65 , so have " borrowed " the beloved oyster card to host a magic @entity102 's thank - you to @entity6 on			2
