touching a phone 's screen will soon be a thing of the past – so soon the technology is only a software update away for some of the most popular smartphones already on the market			1

’ no need to touch : smartphones like the @entity23 are able to be used without touching the screen , all they need is a firmware update the technology has the ability to wake up a smartphone , bring a keyboard onscreen or any number of tasks , according to @entity32			1
@entity14 demonstrated the new functionality on a @entity23 , but told @entity32 it could work on a number of recently released devices			1
touchscreens currently work by detecting electrical currents that pass through a fingertip or stylus , and translate that to select links , start apps and scroll			0
devices can also sense the electrical charge generated by static electricity that results in shocking others , as @entity32 noted , but no devices could take advantage of that until now			2
a @entity52 ’ demonstration viewed by @entity32 showed to be ‘ sensitive , accurate … and very useful , ’ but it is for now limited to only one application			0

the only thing holding the technology back is developer implementation , @entity14 told @entity32			1
fragmentation among operating systems , multiple phone manufacturers and carrier restrictions could make the road to touchless a long one , but at least it ’s viable			0
@entity14 is not putting all its eggs in one basket , it already produces touchscreens for several electronics companies			2
phone makers have not yet commented on whether it will make it onto devices released later this year .			0
