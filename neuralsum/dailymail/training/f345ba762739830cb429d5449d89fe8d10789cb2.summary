' in a vulgar incident earlier this week it emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition @entity4 included a dish called ' @entity53 ' , described as ' small breasts , huge thighs and a big red box '			1

' ' deeply shocked ' : @entity1 prime minister @entity0 was likened to a quail with ' small breasts , huge thighs and a big red box ' on a menu drawn up by the opposition @entity4 miss @entity0 made it clear that she was not going to be drawn in to the rumours mr @entity66 said were being bandied about			1
' i mean , @entity66 , i do n't know if every silly thing that gets said is going to be repeated to me now , ' she said			0
to all the hairdressers out there , including the men who are listening , i do n't think in life one can actually look at a whole profession full of different human beings and say " @entity93 , we know something about every one of those human beings			0
" ' mr @entity66 reminded the prime minister that he had been promised a candid interview with her , asking : ' you can confirm that he 's not ( gay ) ? ' ' @entity66 , do n't be ridiculous , of course he not , ' said the @entity13 - born prime minister			1
' but you 're in a heterosexual relationship ? ' he pressed			0
