dissolving dead bodies to create a brown , foul - smelling syrup may sound gruesome , but that ’s exactly what some people are hoping to happen to them once they pass away			1
the process is called alkaline hydrolysis and was developed more than two decades ago to get rid of animal carcasses			2
it ’s a more efficient and environmentally - friendly of getting rid of dead bodies , according to scientists			2
alkaline hydrolysis uses lye , 300 ° c heat and huge amounts of pressure to destroy bodies in big stainless - steel cylinders that look similar to pressure cookers			2
pictured a machine in which the body is dissolved @entity28 , a mortician from @entity29 , has used her latest @entity31 blog to explain the process with the help of a disco ball @entity35 bottle and a silk purse			1
‘ the dead body is put in a silk bag ’ explains the 30 - year - old			1
‘ that silk bag is putting into a metal tube that looks like the cryogenic tank they put @entity45 in , in @entity46			0
’ the process involves submerging the body in a solution of water and potassium hydroxide , which is then pressurised and heated for two - and - a - half to three hours			1
this leaves a green - brown tinted liquid containing amino acids , peptides , sugars and salts and soft , porous white bone remains which are easily crushed			1
in 2011 , @entity58 's first funeral home which cremates bodies by liquefying them has been ordered to stop the controversial practice			0
officials at @entity64 @entity63 say the procedure called alkaline hydrolysis using lye and heat is not approved under state law			0
@entity70 , owner of the funeral business @entity71 , had used the method on 19 bodies before he was told to stop the practice			0
the health department ordered officials not to issue permits or accept death certificates when bodies are to be disposed of by alkaline hydrolysis			0
but mr @entity70 said : ' there 's no law that says you ca n't do this			0
' according to @entity85 , chairman of the @entity87 's green burial work group , the procedure merely speeds up the body 's natural decomposition process into a matter of hours			1
he said at the time : ' i think burning a body at 2,000 degrees has more of a " yuck factor " to it than putting it into a solution where it 's just naturally going to break down			0
' because of its environmental advantages , some in the funeral industry say it could someday rival burial and cremation			1
it also eliminates concerns about crematorium emissions , including carbon dioxide , which can be released into the air as part of the process			0
but getting the public to accept the process is challenge			0
the process enables a portion of the human remains to be flushed down a drain , and some have branded this ‘ undignified			2
’ ‘ i ’m guessing that the people who say that , do n’t know that in the embalming process , for a traditional funeral , the blood drained out of the body goes right down the drain , ’ said ms @entity28			1
as well as the liquid , the process leaves a dry residue similar in appearance to cremated remains			2
it could be returned to the family in an urn or buried in a cemetery			0

@entity28 , a mortician from @entity29 , describes the process
it involves submerging the body in a water and potassium hydroxide
the dead body is then pressurised and heated for around three hours
this leaves a thick , green - brown tinted liquid that is flushed away
because of its environmental advantages , some in the funeral industry say it could someday rival burial and cremation
