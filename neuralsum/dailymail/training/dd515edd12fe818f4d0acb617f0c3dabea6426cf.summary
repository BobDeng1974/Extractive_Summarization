' it was difficult to be separate from her in those first hours , seeing the other parents on the maternity ward with their children			0
' @entity12 kept running between the wards , showing me pictures of her			0
i finally got to hold her eight hours later			0

' we were told it was an overgrowth disorder - parts of @entity7 ’s body , including her internal organs , would be larger than normal			1
' i went home and searched online for @entity8			2
it was n’t a very good idea , and it left me quite shocked			0

@entity8 is a rare genetic condition , affecting around one in every 15,000 births			1
the figure is likely to be higher in reality , with mild cases rarely diagnosed			0
cases have been reported in most developed countries , and in the majority of cases it appears to be an isolated case with no known relatives suffering the disorder			0
in some cases there is evidence the condition can be inherited			2
children with @entity8 are often born prematurely but are larger and heavier than expected , given their early arrival			1
typically a child born with @entity8 will have an enlarged tongue , which can causes breathing , feeding and speaking difficulties , as well as excessive dribbling			1
it can also cause respiratory problems and result in a protruding lower jaw			0
babies can be born with reddended skin on the forehead and eyelids , which usually fades in the first few years			0
children born with @entity8 are at risk of developing various types of tumours			1
around 7.5 per cent will develop a @entity119 , a tumour of the kidney			0
due to the aggressive nature of these tumours , a child with @entity8 will need to be screened every three months until the age of seven or eight , when the susceptibilty to the tumours diminishes			1
children with the condition are also likely to suffer enlarged abdominal organs , overgrowth of one half of the body , liver tumours and an enlarged heart or heart defects			2
@entity8 is diagnosed genetically in 80 per cent of cases , with the remainder being diagnosed after a clinical examination			2

sufferers can experience problems with abdominal wall tissue , enlarged tongues , enlarged limbs and , in some cases , hearing loss and heart disorders			0
mrs @entity7 and her husband , a chef , were allowed to take @entity7 home on the understanding she would need operations to reduce the size of her tongue while she was still a baby			1
she said : ' when we brought her home our other children were over the moon			0
they were so happy to have their little sister with them for the first time			0
' unfortunately i could n’t breast - feed her			0
she had to be fed by a tube for a long time			0
there were concerns that the tongue would cause problems with her breathing , so we were quite cautious			0
' we took @entity7 to a check - up appointment at @entity178 when she was 15 weeks old and a cranio - facial consultant was concerned enough to admit her to a ward urgently			1
' @entity7 eventually underwent her first tongue reduction operation in september 2010 , when she was six months old			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' by then her tongue was so large it was covering her chin			1
we knew she would need an operation eventually , but we did n’t know she would also need a tracheostomy			0
' to hear she would need such help to breathe came completely out of the blue and we were quite shocked			0
' she coped fine after the operation			0
she was already being fed through a tube so , unlike other children who have been through the operation , she did n’t have to cope with eating with stitches on her tongue			0
' we kept up with her painkillers and she got through it fine			0
' despite early hopes that a single operation would be enough to correct the problem , @entity7 required two more operations in march 2011 and march 2012 before doctors were confident her tongue would develop normally			1
@entity7 at her fourth birthday party in march this year			2

she added : ' after everything that happened , she 's a very happy child ' in october 2012 , @entity7 ’s tracheostomy was repaired and today she eats and breathes unaided			2
mrs @entity7 said : ' she was a little late walking and she is still learning to talk properly - family members can understand but strangers sometimes struggle to follow her			1
but she is hitting all her milestones more - or-less as expected			0
' we ’ve always been a close family , and we helped to keep each other calm during moments when we were n’t clear on how things were going to turn out for @entity7			2
' i ’ve also found good support on @entity223 among families of other children with the condition , although it ’s extremely rare for a child to have @entity8 and require a tracheostomy , as she did			2
' she ’s extremely cheerful and loves playing with her brothers and sisters			0
she ’s doing amazingly well at school , and has got lots of friends			0
' after everything that happened , she ’s a very happy child			0
