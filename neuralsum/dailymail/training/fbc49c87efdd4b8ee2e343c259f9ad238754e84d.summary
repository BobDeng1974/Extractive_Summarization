crackdown : @entity0 will unveil plans to stamp out the ' scandal ' of binge drinking @entity0 will declare war on the scourge of cheap alcohol today			0
as part of a series of measures to stamp out what he condemns as the ‘ scandal ’ of binge drinking , the prime minister will make clear the government wants to introduce a minimum price for alcohol and put higher taxes on strong lagers			1
he will throw his weight behind plans to emulate @entity20 where supermarkets and pubs are forced to charge a minimum of 45p per unit of alcohol to prevent the cut - price selling blamed for fuelling the orgy of public drunkenness			1
his wide - ranging crackdown will also include plans for : on a trip to a hospital in the @entity32 , mr @entity0 will announce that treating patients with alcohol problems and victims of drunken attacks costs the @entity37 £ 2.7billion a year , or £ 90 for every taxpayer in @entity39			1
last year there were 200,000 hospital admissions with a primary alcohol - related diagnosis , 40 per cent higher than in 2003			1
the number of patients admitted with acute intoxication has more than doubled to 18,500 over the same period			0
mr @entity0 will say : ‘ this is one of the scandals of our society and i am determined to deal with it			0
this is an area where the drinks industry , supermarkets , pubs and clubs need to work with government so that responsible drinking becomes a reality and not just a slogan			2
booze @entity39 : there were 200,000 hospital admissions for alcohol - related conditions last year - up more than 40 per cent since 2003 ‘ whether it ’s the police officers in @entity70 that have been deployed in some hospitals , the booze buses in @entity65 and @entity66 , or the drunk tanks used abroad , we need innovative solutions to confront the rising tide of unacceptable behaviour			1
’ senior sources say the plans will be published in full in the government ’s long - awaited alcohol strategy due next month , but final decisions could be delayed until the budget on march 21 since decisions on duty would have to be announced to @entity83 by the chancellor			1
the plans are bound to provoke scepticism as to whether raising prices will be enough to change the behaviour of young drinkers , but they are supported by groups like @entity90			0
@entity92 mps have also expressed concerns about minimum pricing , amid fears that voters would be angered by paying extra for alcohol during a time of austerity			2
but mr @entity0 is willing to overrule embattled health secretary @entity100 , who fears minimum pricing will hurt the poor , because it would be popular with many in the medical profession who are fighting the government ’s @entity37 reforms			2
mr @entity0 will say : ‘ every night , in town centres , hospitals and police stations across the country , people have to cope with the consequences of alcohol abuse			2
and the problem is getting worse			0
end of cheap alcohol : the government could impose a minimum price for alcohol			2
in @entity20 there is a minimum price of 45p per unit ‘ over the last decade we ’ve seen a frightening growth in the number of people – many under - age – who think it ’s acceptable to get drunk in public in ways that wreck lives , spread fear and increase crime			1
‘ as figures today show , the @entity37 is having to pick up an ever - growing bill of £ 2.7billion a year , including £ 1billion on accident and emergency services alone			1
that ’s money we have to spend because of the reckless behaviour of an irresponsible minority			0
‘ across the country hospitals , ambulance crews and the police are rising to the challenge			0
we must help them to do so and will be setting out how through the forthcoming @entity145			0
‘ this is n’t just about more rules and regulation			0
it ’s about responsibility and a sense of respect for others			0
’ a recent official study found that setting a minimum price of 30p a unit would prevent 300 deaths a year , 40p about 1,000 deaths , and 50p more than 2,000 premature deaths			1
the new measures will be accompanied by an ‘ aggressive ’ public health campaign and a more draconian approach to curtailing the sale of alcohol in shops , pubs and clubs			1
in @entity169 , police keep cells aside as ‘ drunk tank ’ holding pens for binge - drinkers to be incarcerated until they sober up			1
for the past two years an alcohol recovery centre has been set up in @entity65 , @entity176 , over the @entity178 period			0
drunken revellers are given advice on alcohol abuse as they recover from their nights out and wait to be collected by friends or family			2
a @entity186 spokesman said : ‘ a final decision is to be taken on the alcohol strategy , but this is an idea the prime minister has said publicly that he is interested in			0

alcohol - related *disorder* costs @entity37 £ 2.7bn a year
50p per unit minimum would save 2,000 lives a year
@entity20 supermarkets and pubs forced to charge a minimum of 45p per unit
‘ drunk tank ’ cells where those deemed *incapable* of *walking* home would be sent by police to sleep it off ;
use of ‘ booze buses ’ which pick up revellers and take them to the cells ;
police deployed in accident and emergency wards to prevent drunken violence ;
*paramedics* to be sent into nightclubs to treat drunken patients on the spot to ease the burden on the @entity37 .
