the @entity2 ' lost ' the emails of six other agency officials associated with a scheme to target conservative organizations – in addition to those of former official @entity8 – and kept it a secret for months , the @entity0 learned on tuesday			1
the news prompted the @entity11 to issue broad subpoenas on tuesday afternoon for hard drives , thumb drives and other backups that @entity8 and the tax authorities may have used to archive her messages			1
@entity0 chairman @entity18 and rep. @entity19 , who chairs the @entity0 oversight subcommittee , said that the @entity2 has known as far back as february that it no longer had email correspondence for @entity8 and other key players implicated in the tea party targeting scandal and failed to share that information with @entity26			1
' it looks like the @entity30 people were lied to and the @entity2 tried to cover - up the fact it conveniently lost key documents in this investigation , ' the duo said in a press release			2
' plot lines in @entity36 are more believable than what we are getting from this @entity39 and the @entity2			2
hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received approval			0
the @entity2 informed the committee on friday that 28 months of emails of the former head of the tax - exempt division , @entity8 , had been lost in a computer crash and could not be recovered because many records were not backed up on servers , tapes or external drives			1
its own guidelines require that ' @entity2 offices will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages that are federal records only on the electronic mail system			1
' it also requires its offices to back up email messages to ' a separate electronic recordkeeping system			1
' the @entity76 reported on tuesday that @entity2 regulations require employees to print out copies of all communications that are subject to federal recordkeeping laws			2
' the @entity83 ’s current email policy requires emails and attachments that meet the definition of a federal record be added to the organization ’s files , ' the agency 's employee guidance reads , ' by printing them ( including the essential transmission data ) and filing them with related paper records			1
' according to the @entity2 , none of this happened and @entity8 's emails from january 2009 to april 2010 are missing			1
now the @entity2 says its also missing emails for @entity100 , who served as chief of staff to @entity102 , then - deputy commissioner of the @entity2			2
@entity100 visited the @entity39 more than a dozen times between july 2010 and april 2013 , according to a @entity104			0
the @entity0 leaders said tuesday that @entity100 's repeated visits to the @entity39 were suspicious and will be the subject of further investigation			2
' who was she visiting at the @entity39 and what were they talking about ? was she updating the @entity39 on the targeting or was she getting orders ? these are answers we do n’t yet have , because – surprise , surprise – a few computers crashed , ' they said			0
@entity2 commissioner @entity119 will be hauled before two @entity39 committee hearings next week to explain how @entity8 's emails could have been lost despite robust data - retention standards in the @entity30 government @entity124 : @entity8 retired with a full government pension and has refused to testify about her role in a years - long scheme to target tea party groups with politically imbalanced scrutiny @entity18 and @entity19 said monday that ' we are simply not going to accept the @entity2 claim that these documents are not recoverable			1
we will demand the president live up to his promise to work " hand in hand " with @entity26 to get the facts			0
' the two lawmakers wrote to president @entity137 yesterday asking for its records of emails between @entity8 and employees the @entity39 , the @entity83 , the @entity142 , the @entity143 , the @entity144 and the @entity145			1
that move came hours after @entity0 staff interviewed government employees charged with running the @entity2 's internal computer networks			1
a committee aide told @entity151 that those @entity2 workers confirmed that budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials ' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives			1
they also said , according to the aide , that other executive branch agencies have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the @entity2			2
@entity18 and @entity19 asked @entity137 to order ' an exhaustive search for all @entity8 emails ' throughout the executive branch			0
@entity167 hope to establish whether or not @entity8 colluded with @entity137 administration officials to play political favorites and single out right - wing groups for special scrutiny			1
but the @entity39 is likely under no obligation to cooperate			0
president @entity137 has already referred to the @entity2 matter as one of several ' phony scandals ' that he believes are politically motivated			0
yet in may 2013 when the scandal first erupted , @entity137 pledged that his administration would ' make sure that we are working hand in hand with @entity26 to get this thing fixed			0
' subpoena : rep. @entity182 is demanding @entity119 show up for an evening interrogation on june 23 the @entity184 threw that phrase back in the president 's face on monday			2
' in order to ensure accountability and “ get this thing fixed , ” please provide ... all communications between @entity8 and any persons within the @entity191 ( @entity191 ) for the period between january 1 , 2009 and may 1 , 2011 , ' they wrote			0
' also , please indicate in writing when the @entity191 [ executive office of the president ] was informed , and by whom , that the @entity2 had lost critical @entity8 documents			2
' yesterday , @entity199 rep. @entity182 , who chairs the @entity11 , demanded that @entity2 commissioner @entity119 explain – in person – how 28 months of emails to and from @entity8 were ' lost ' to a computer crash			1
@entity182 wrote to @entity119 in reaction to his agency 's claim friday that the @entity2 no longer has copies of emails between @entity8 and anyone outside the @entity2 from january 2009 through april 2011			1
@entity182 demanded in his letter that @entity119 appear in a rare evening hearing on june 23 , a half - day before he 's scheduled to testify before the @entity0			2
' i will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game - playing in response to the @entity11 ’s investigation of the @entity2 targeting , ' he wrote			0
' for too long , the @entity2 has promised to produce requested – and , later , subpoenaed – documents , only to respond later with excuses and inaction			0
' in the @entity11 , @entity182 hammered @entity119 for promising in a march 26 hearing that he would deliver every email @entity26 sought			0
at the time , however , he insisted that it would take ' years ' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the @entity2 is n't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government			0
and simply searching through @entity8 's individual email storage , @entity119 said then , would n't produce an exhaustive record			1
' they ’re stored somewhere , ' he explained to @entity232 rep. @entity231 during the hearing			0
' they get taken off and stored in servers and you ’ve got 90 - thousand employees , ' he insisted , but ' we can find , and we are in fact searching – we can find @entity8 ’s emails			1
' at the time , he did n't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives			0
the @entity248 has the original files , ' @entity247 speechwriter @entity246 tweeted			0
' wonder what the # @entity2 would say if we told them we could n’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash ? ' replied her boss , @entity255 @entity167 sen. @entity167			1
' @entity257 ' game show host @entity258 , who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years , tweeted : ' weird			0
hundreds of emails to & from someone named @entity8 just showed up in my spam			0

a *congressional* committee has issued subpoenas for all the hard drives the @entity2 and former official @entity8 used to back up her emails
@entity2 policy requires the agency to print out every email that archiving laws apply to , just in case electronic records are lost
but on friday the @entity2 told told the @entity0 that more than two years ' worth of @entity8 's emails to and from people outside the @entity2 were lost in a computer crash
now the agency says it does not have emails for six other officials involved in the tea party targeting scandal
@entity2 commissioner @entity119 testified in march that @entity8 's emails were accessible but would take ' years ' in some cases to gather
@entity119 said messages are stored ' on a server ' and not on individual employees ' *pcs*
@entity167 hope to find out if @entity2 officials colluded with the @entity39 , the @entity142 , the @entity83 or other agencies to play political favorites with the tax code
