a creative pet owner has made sure that her dog turns heads when out for a walk by painting her to look like a tiger			2
dog groomer @entity6 transformed pint - sized cavachon , @entity8 , into the big cat by covering her in orange and black stripes with special dye for pets			1
the 44 - year - old shocked her husband @entity14 , 47 , and their three children , @entity17 , 29 , @entity18 , 16 , and @entity19 , 14 , when she unveiled the outrageous look after the two - and - a - half - hour makeover session			1
and her creative grooming has proved a hit with neighbours , who stop and ask to take photos with @entity8 when they see her on the street			2
but the @entity52 has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have ' potentially fatal consequences '			1
a spokesman said : ' there is the potential for the dye or paint to be toxic and harm the animals			2
' although some substances may be labelled as being suitable for human consumption , this does not mean that these substances would therefore be suitable for animals			0
' there are many things which humans can eat and drink which are not safe for animals			0
' mrs @entity6 said : ' i thought i 'd try and get into creative grooming and give the family a surprise - who does n't like tigers ? ' my husband looked at me like i was mad and the kids were a bit embarrassed but once they 've all seen the reaction she 's getting i think they have changed their tune			1
' i spent about two and a half hours in total using special dye that you can buy from groomers online for about Â£ 7.50			1
' its a trend that 's big in the @entity89 and @entity90 but i think it will finally take off in @entity92 soon as well			2
is that you ? one of @entity8 's friends takes a good sniff of her newly - painted fur when they meet on the street tiny @entity97 : mrs @entity6 said that she thought her pet looked like a character from @entity100 striking stripes : @entity8 's new look has attracted plenty of attention from shop owners and neighbours ' i ca n't say she 's very ferocious looking though she 's as soft as anything			1
she looks like a baby @entity97 from @entity109			0
' when we went up town everybody wanted selfies , from shop owners to the tattoo parlour guys			0
i spent about two hours in town when i only wanted to pop out for a bit			0
' people were beeping their horns and everybody is saying how cute she looks			0
' the response has been amazing			0
