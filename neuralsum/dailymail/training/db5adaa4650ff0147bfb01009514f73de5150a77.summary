hurt : mr @entity7 now has to wear a catheter following the mysterious incident no fear : despite mr @entity7 's neighbours claiming that he was the victim of a dog attack , the 64 - year - old is clearly undeterred from being around canines - he was pictured relaxing with a dog while the neighbour 's dog attack tale may seem a little far fetched , it is not entirely unbelievable			2

fortunately the snake was not venomous and the man only suffered minor injuries .			0
