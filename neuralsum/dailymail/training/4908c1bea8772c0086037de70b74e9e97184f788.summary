by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 4 january 2013 @entity2 's plan to claw back child benefit through the tax system is due to kick in from monday hundreds of thousands more families could end up losing some or all of their child benefit , it emerged yesterday			1
financial experts say they would join the ranks of the more than a million who will lose an average of £ 1,300 this year			2
with the benefit starting to be means - tested from monday , the @entity12 issued a withering verdict on the ‘ incoherence ’ of the policy			2
it said that while 85 per cent of families would continue to receive the benefit following this year ’s reforms , more and more families will lose it in the years ahead as wages rise but the threshold for losing the benefit remains at the same level			0
‘ the number who will lose at least some child benefit will just increase indefinitely as you go further and further into the future , ’ said @entity28 , of the @entity12			2
the government says it has no plans to change the threshold at which child benefit is lost from the current £ 60,000			2
the @entity12 estimated that 820,000 families in which one partner earns more than £ 60,000 will lose all their child benefit this year , while a further 320,000 families in which the highest earner is paid between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 will see some of their payments cut			1
the @entity12 released this graph which shows how the marginal tax rate faced by parents earning between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 could top 65 per cent for anyone with three children in 2013 - 14 it said the average loss is £ 1,300 a year			1
its report warned that larger families will face crippling marginal tax rates – the effective tax rate on every extra pound of income , taking into account both extra tax paid and withdrawn benefits			0
this is because for every £ 100 earned between £ 50,000 and £ 60,0000 , 1 per cent of child benefit will be cut			1
the marginal tax rate between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 will increase by about 11 percentage points for the first child , to 51 per cent , and a further seven points for each subsequent child , the @entity12 said			1
so , for example , while about 320,000 people will lose more than 50p in every extra pound they earn between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 , about 40,000 of them – those with three or more children – will find that their marginal tax rate jumps to at least 65 per cent			1
@entity73 said he is ' pleased ' with how things were going despite the confusion families with four children with one earner on between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 will face an extraordinary marginal tax rate of 71.5 per cent			1
experts say this will create huge incentives for people in this income band to reduce their taxable income – for example , by contributing more to a private pension or working less			0
mr @entity28 said the reforms , which were watered down by the chancellor following protests from conservative mps , will create ‘ a series of administrative complexities , including the need for up to 500,000 more individuals to fill in self - assessment forms ’			0
he added that the ‘ biggest concern ’ is the incoherence the change will create in the welfare system			0
families will have to get to grips with the different ways child benefit and child tax credits – soon to be the child addition within the universal credit – are assessed , mr @entity28 said			0
a @entity108 spokesman said : ‘ withdrawing child benefit on the basis of the combined family income would require intrusive means - testing of all eight million households getting child benefit			0
‘ the way we are doing it is simpler for the vast majority of families			0

changes to cut child benefit for families with someone earning more than £ 50,000 start on monday
