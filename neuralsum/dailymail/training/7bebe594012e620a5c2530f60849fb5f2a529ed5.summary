by @entity0 it may not look like a big catch , but this tiny fish has broken the record for being the largest tiddler ever caught in @entity7 waters			1
the huge stickleback was hooked by keen angler @entity9 , 25 , who is celebrating after breaking the record – which he set himself last year			2
mr @entity9 , a warehouse worker from @entity12 , @entity13 , caught the three - spined stickleback - which weighs the same as a £ 2 coin - in a lake near his home using a tiny piece of worm as bait and the smallest hook he could get his hands on			1
big catch : @entity9 , 25 , is celebrating after breaking the record for catching the biggest tiddler in @entity7 for the second year running which he caught using a worm as bait the stickleback fish weighed in at a 12 grams , or just under half an ounce , and measured 2.9 inches in length , breaking the @entity7 record set by mr @entity9 in 2013 he had been fishing for about an hour and reeled in hundreds of miniscule fish before he pulled up the record - breaking specimen			1
weighing in at 12 grams , or just under half an ounce , and measuring 2.9 inches in length , the fish smashes the record mr @entity9 set in april 2013			1
the specimen is three grams heavier than one he caught last year , which was heavy enough to set an official record at 8.8 grams but was never verified			1
the previous record for a three - spined stickleback was set in 1998 by @entity43 in @entity44			2
mr @entity9 said he had set out to catch a three - spined stickleback - @entity46 aculeatus in @entity47 - because he feels some of the smaller species are overlooked by anglers			1
he said : ‘ there is a lake in a wooded area near where i live so i went down there to spend an hour or so fishing			0
‘ not many people fish for the small species and i think they are underrated , so i decided that i would try and go for them			0
‘ i set up a small float and a really small , size 26 hook , and i used a tiny piece of worm as bait			0
the recent catch is three grams heavier than one he caught in april last year ( pictured ) , which was heavy enough to set an official record at 8.8 grams but was never verified mr @entity9 said he had set out to catch a three - spined stickleback - @entity46 aculeatus in @entity47 - because he feels some of the smaller species are overlooked by anglers			1
pictured : his previous record - breaking catch ‘ during the session time i caught about 100 stickleback which were all pretty small , but then i saw the float go under			0
‘ i knew it was going to be bigger than the rest but when i pulled it up i could n't believe it			0
‘ i put it on some kitchen scales and it weighed six drams , which is 12 grams			2
it was also over two inches in length			0
‘ last year i broke the @entity7 record with a five dram fish so i was really excited because this one was even bigger than that			1
