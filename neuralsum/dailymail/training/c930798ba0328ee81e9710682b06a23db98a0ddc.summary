@entity1 supporters will not appreciate the comparison but one of sir @entity4 ’s great skills at @entity5 was to ensure that , on the whole , his stellar players left the club on his terms rather than their own			1
@entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and even @entity16 , to an extent , all walked out of @entity17 when @entity4 , and his club , were ready			0
whether @entity1 can adequately absorb the inevitable sense of loss that will accompany @entity22 ’s departure remains to be seen			1
certainly his is a decision that , at this juncture , looks set to benefit him more than it does @entity1			2
@entity22 looks relaxed during training after announcing he will leave @entity1 in the summer to suggest that @entity1 , their chief executive @entity29 and manager @entity31 , have mismanaged the @entity22 situation over the last 12 months would be a little unfair			1
managing contractual issues with a club ’s biggest player is not always easy			0
united themselves discovered this with @entity38			0
nevertheless , it is clear that @entity22 was upset he had been allowed to reach the onset of winter without receiving a firm offer to remain at @entity42			0
he pretty much said so in newspaper interviews in november			0
@entity15 and @entity13 are two players who left @entity5 on sir @entity4 's terms whether this has contributed to his decision to leave only he will know , but what is more clear is that the decision speaks volumes for the @entity42 captain ’s feelings about his club ’s chances of significant success on the field over the next 18 months			2
had @entity22 genuinely felt @entity31 was likely to lead @entity1 back in to contention in the @entity59 next season then it is hard to imagine he would have left			1
his close friend @entity61 has already made that mistake , after all			0
that he has decided to pursue options abroad while his legs can still carry him forward says a lot for his views on the immediate prospects of @entity31 ’ squad			0
@entity22 leaves @entity69 on friday and will be driving away for good at the end of the season plenty of words have been spoken this season about @entity22 ’s longevity			1
questions have been asked about his capabilities at the highest level and it was interesting to see @entity1 produce one of their better @entity59 performances — beating @entity82 4 - 1 — last monday without him in the team			2
do not be fooled , though			0
@entity22 remains fundamental to @entity1 , on and off the field			1
in his absence , there is no natural successor as captain and — with respect to the likes of @entity91 and @entity92 — there is no marquee player left behind			2
@entity1 beat @entity82 4 - 1 on monday and captain @entity22 was left on the bench @entity22 celebrates scoring against @entity96 - one of his seven goals for the @entity98 this season it is the first time in a long time we have said this			1
even during the lean years there was @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity105			0
without @entity22 , the current @entity1 squad lacks world - class stardust and , given what they threatened to achieve in the @entity59 only eight months ago , that is quite remarkable			1
@entity31 will have to plan for the future at @entity1 without @entity22 this is not the end for @entity31 ’ @entity42 project			2
@entity1 have a talented manager and some very good footballers			0
however , the fact this great club has reached this inevitable crossroads a year earlier than anybody ever really expected is something they may yet have cause to regret .			1

@entity22 is leaving @entity1 on his terms - not the club 's
@entity22 leaves behind a squad without a leader or marquee player
@entity1 at at a crossroads a year earlier than they would have expected
