with four excited little girls under two , @entity0 and @entity1 are expecting @entity3 to be rather hectic			1
but the couple plan to make the most of every moment			1
their quads – the first ever born in @entity9 who are two sets of identical twins – are the children they thought they ’d never have			1
lined up for the camera : mother @entity1 used all her tricks to get ( l - r ) @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 the two pairs , @entity16 and @entity17 , and @entity15 and @entity18 , were conceived during a third attempt at @entity21 and , growing from two implanted embryos , were born at odds of ten million to one on december 27 , 2009			1
‘ i feel lucky every time i look at them , ’ said mrs @entity1 , 36			1
‘ but @entity3 is particularly emotional – this time two years ago i was pregnant and had no idea if they ’d survive			1
’ mrs @entity1 , of @entity28 , @entity29 , who also has a ten - year - old son @entity30 , admits she struggles to tell the girls apart , relying on their temperaments and , in one case , a freckle to identify them			1
here , using all her tricks , she got them in order for a @entity3 photo , from left : @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
yet originally mrs @entity1 and her husband , 37 , an electrical designer , from @entity28 , @entity29 , had simply wanted a sibling for their son @entity30 , now 10			2
after failing to conceive naturally a second time , they spent £ 9,000 savings on fertility treatment and were shocked when doctors broke the news they were expecting quads			1
says mrs @entity1 : “ two embryos had been placed back into my uterus but everyone was stunned when both of them grew into two sets of identical twins			1
even doctors could n’t believe it			2
’ but their joy was tainted when doctors explained quadruplet pregnancies are very rare and potentially very dangerous			2
happy family : the four girls sit happily with their mother @entity1 and father @entity0 , with brother @entity30 , 10 , making the family complete despite all the odds , however , after a problem - free pregnancy the girls , born at 31.5 weeks were healthy			1
identical twins @entity18 and @entity15 each weighed @entity72 while twins @entity16 and @entity17 , who are also identical , weighed @entity74 and @entity75 respectively			1
and now all of the girls are walking , talking and climbing – and they ’re developing their own individual little personalities			2
explains their mum : ‘ @entity18 is the most dominant and probably the naughtiest as she is always up to something and her twin , @entity15 is very placid			2
‘ @entity0 and i ca n’t tell @entity17 and @entity16 apart just by looking at them – so @entity16 , whose only difference is a freckle behind her left knee - wears a bracelet			1
but @entity17 is super lively and always on the go while @entity16 is more timid and loves sitting on my knee			2
’ on a normal day their mother , who fits part time work around her husband , goes through 20 nappies , two packs of wet wipes , eight pints of milk , @entity98 of potatoes , puts on four loads of washing and does several hours of tumble drying			2
she says : “ we ’re on our second washing machine and tumble drier in less than two years			0
and i shop every other day for food – my bill comes to around £ 200 a week			0
’ a usual day in the @entity1 household begins around 5.30am when the girls – who each share a room with their twin at the family ’s four - bed detached house – wake up			1
says mrs @entity1 : ‘ @entity0 and i give them their bottles			0
then an hour later we put up four high chairs and give each of them their bowls of cereal			0
after that it ’s upstairs to get dressed – which can be quite difficult with four wriggling toddlers			0
’ @entity3 miracles : the girls pictured at just five days old , shortly after they were born as the first set of quads in @entity9 including two sets of identical twins the couple cook all the family meals from scratch			1
she says : ‘ it would be easy to give them fish fingers and chicken nuggets but we manage by bulk cooking			0
so we might make several shepherd ’s pies in one go and freeze them			0
’ and she manages their wardrobe by buying identical outfits – although buying the same for four children means a dress , cardigan , tights and shoes for all of them often tops £ 150 a shop			0
she explains : ‘ i do feel very proud seeing them all dressed in the same little outfits			0
but mostly going to the park is much easier if they are all dressed in the same clothes			0
for example , they all have a bright pink coat on with ducks and when i round them up i just have to search for the bright pink toddlers			0
needless to say though , i try to avoid buying any clothes that need ironing … ’ meanwhile , the family also possesses a quad buggy with two seats in two rows from @entity170 , which just about fits into their @entity172 car			0
she says : ‘ we do take the girls on holiday – earlier this year we went to @entity176 but we always travel at night as the girls can be quite noisy and it ’s much more peaceful when they ’re all asleep			0
’ in the evening , baths are taken in twos with the girls going to bed around 6.45			0
‘ @entity0 and i often do n’t eat until 9.30pm , ’ she sighs , ‘ it is tiring because obviously we are also busy with @entity30 taking him to friends and after - school events			1
‘ but despite that , we adore having a big family			0
and i only have to see the girls in their cots asleep looking like little angels to forget even the busiest and most fraught days			0
