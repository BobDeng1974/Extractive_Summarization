@entity1 researchers have found that high - fructose corn syrup can cause behavioral reactions in rats ' similar to those produced by drugs of abuse , such as cocaine '			1
professor @entity9 of the @entity10 , who carried out the research , said it suggested there was an addictive quality to foods that contain high levels of high - fructose corn syrup which could explain , at least partly , the current global obesity epidemic			1
during the experiment , rats were fed foods containing varying levels of high - fructose corn syrup			1
they were then given access to a lever which controlled how much syrup they received			0
the more concentrated the syrup , the harder the rats worked to obtain it			2
sweet temptation : new research has found that high - fructose corn syrup has similar effects on the brain as addictive drugs like cocaine ' we have evidence in laboratory animals of a shared vulnerability to develop preferences for sweet foods and for cocaine , ' said professor @entity9 , an addiction expert			1
' there is now convincing neurobiological and behavioural evidence indicating that addiction to food is possible			0
' professor @entity9 believes vulnerability to addiction could explain why some people are obese and some are n't , despite the widespread availability of high - fructose corn syrup			1
ubiquitous : corn products can be found in every element of a fast food meal , and high - fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients in everything from burger buns and sauces to soft drinks the new findings are part of a growing field of investigation into the effects of high fructose corn syrup , which has been blamed for everything from the obesity epidemic to diabetes and liver disease			1
research from @entity77 in 2010 found that rats fed on a sugary diet became nervous and anxious when the sugar was removed			2
they were thrown into a state of anxiety similar to the kind of stress that people feel during withdrawal from drugs like nicotine and even morphine			0
professor @entity90 and his team in the @entity92 and the @entity93 have been studying signs of sugar addiction in rats for years			0
fat rats : recent research shows that high - fructose corn syrup is highly addictive to rats ' if bingeing on sugar is really a form of addiction , there should be long - lasting effects in the brains of sugar addicts , ' @entity90 said			1
' craving and relapse are critical components of addiction , and we have been able to demonstrate these behaviors in sugar - bingeing rats in a number of ways			0
' the process : the @entity117 says that processed foods are the main source sugar in our diets - but that many food producers are reluctant to reveal just how much high - fructose corn syrup their products contain journalist and author @entity126 says that cheap industrial corn is such a huge crop in @entity130 that you 're likely to find it in every section of the supermarket , not to mention every item in a fast food meal			1
' @entity137 is the sweetener in the soda			0
it 's in the corn - fed beef @entity142 patty , and in the high - fructose syrup in the bun , and in the secret sauce , ' wrote @entity126 in the @entity146			2
high fructose corn syrup was discovered in the 1950s , but it was n't until the ' 70s that it became widely used			2
excess : the @entity130 government subsidizes corn farms - meaning there 's huge quantities of excess corn being produced which is used for everything from cattle feed to ethanol to the addictive high - fructose corn syrup the gloopy syrup is made from surplus corn crops , and can be found in sweet foods such as donuts , chocolate bars and soda			1
the danger lies in the places you do n't expect to find it : loaves of bread , pizza , meat , savory snacks and salad dressing			0
former head of the @entity177 @entity176 believes that sugar is extremely addictive , just like cigarettes or alcohol			0
he told the @entity181 in 2012 that eating sugar it is ' highly pleasurable			0
it gives you this momentary bliss			0
when you 're eating food that is highly hedonic , it sort of takes over your brain			0
' we all know that sweet confectionery and soft drinks are full of high - fructose corn syrup ( @entity194 ) , but could we be feeding our addictions with other foods and not knowing it ? here are some unexpected supermarket products that are full of high fructose corn syrup			1
@entity201 bread : you could be inadvertently eating high - fructose corn syrup in your lunchtime sandwich			2

a new study by @entity1 researchers has found that high - fructose corn syrup can cause reactions similar to those to cocaine
the study *measured* rats ' reactions to higher and higher levels of high - fructose corn syrup
the study suggests that high - fructose corn syrup could explain the current obesity epidemic
