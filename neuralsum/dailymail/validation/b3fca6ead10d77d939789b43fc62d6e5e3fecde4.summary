@entity7 , who was the show 's resident racing driver between 2002 to 2003 , said that @entity2 without @entity6 simply ' wo n't work '			1
he said : ' i think you 're going to have a diluted product			0
i do n't think it will have the value that it did , here and overseas			0
' ' and @entity16 help any soul who takes his place , because that 's like signing up for your own firing squad			1
he also said that the @entity4 's decision to suspend @entity6 and drop the rest of the current series of @entity2 amid allegations @entity6 punched a producer was ' a complete overreaction ' the presenter told waiting reporters that he was off to have ' lunch with a friend ' as he left his home yesterday ' the only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose			1
' @entity6 's future at the @entity4 is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in @entity42			1

he said : ' the charm and brilliance of @entity6 are that he is a slightly loose cannon , you 're not quite sure what he 's going to do next			1
' there is an unpredictability coupled with creative genius the inflammatory comments follow a string of racism rows			2
