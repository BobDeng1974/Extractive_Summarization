@entity0 has been awarded £ 400 after being put up in a @entity2 hotel by @entity3 a parish councillor has won a £ 400 payout from @entity3 after booking what he thought was a ' relaxing holiday ' to a @entity9 party island where he was housed with ' boozed up ' youngsters at a @entity2 hotel			1
@entity0 , 56 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , planned to spend a week on the island of @entity16 with his partner @entity17 , 51 , in september			1
rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for , the couple , who run a sweet shop in @entity21 , @entity14 , were booked into @entity24 in the resort of @entity26 in @entity16 , advertised as an 18 - 30 clubbing destination			1
after spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were ' banging on the walls and screaming and shouting ' , the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet			1
they have since been awarded £ 400 in compensation by the holiday company			1
while being advertised by @entity2 , @entity24 is described on the @entity3 website as ' one of the best chill - out zones ' in @entity16			1
upon their arrival however mr @entity0 found ' boozed up ' youngsters who ' did n't seem to sleep '			2
' when we got there i asked the rep if he really thought i would book an 18 - 30 holiday , ' the @entity44 councillor said			0
' when i go on holiday i do n't care really where it is , i want to just have a good time but it was n't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people			0
' it was an official 18 - 30 resort			0
it was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting , so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking			0
' after complaining to the @entity3 rep at the resort , the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the £ 600 they had already spent			1
they would also have no other choice but to go to another @entity2 , said mr @entity0			2
' we were just speechless really , it was n't what we wanted or what we were expecting and @entity17 was horrified			0
' while the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with ' rowdy ' youngsters , they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel 's treatment towards them			2
' the apartments did n't have hot water but when i complained the owner used very , very rude language			0
' at that mr @entity0 and his partner packed their things immediately and , they say , waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation			2
eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the @entity101			0
mr @entity0 decided to launch legal action when they failed to act , and was recently offered £ 400 after requesting a summons from a judge			1
the hotel where mr @entity0 and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the @entity26 strip ( above ) , hailed as one of @entity16 's biggest nightlife spots the 56 - year - old @entity44 councillor said @entity24 ( above ) where he was placed was ' packed with youngsters ' who ' screamed and banged on walls ' ' i 'm not surprised at all ( that they 've offered me money ) , they did n't have a leg to stand on , ' he said , speaking of the offer			1
' they sent us to an 18 - 30s hotel having seen how old we looked			0
' among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns : ' do n't bother if you are over thirty as it 's too noisy			0
' the apartments are a five minute walk from the @entity26 strip , described by @entity3 as @entity16 's ' party resort ' whose nightlife is ' in the same league as @entity134 '			1
but mr @entity0 claims he was sold a relaxing holiday , with the resort also described as suitable for family trips			1
among @entity140 reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as ' filthy ' and ' noisy '			0
one positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the ' ultimate ' place for a boys or girls ' holiday			0
@entity3 apologised for the couple 's experience in september			2
' we would like to apologise to mr @entity0 for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the @entity24 in @entity16 with our @entity156 brand in september 2014 , ' a spokesman said			1
' it is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction			0
