the first genetically modified meat and fish could be approved this summer			0
authorities in the @entity3 are expected to grant approval to @entity6 salmon , which has been modified to grow twice as fast as normal salmon			1
and experts trying to combat world hunger are calling on the @entity10 to back the use of @entity13 farm animals on the dinner table here			1
approved : @entity3 authorities have given the go ahead for salmon that grow twice as fast as normal fish , paving the way for the government to back the use of them here the push into @entity13 meat could see the production of giant pigs , hens that have only female chicks and cattle made disease resistant using genes from baboons			1
but the move will alarm critics of the use of gm technology who are still battling to block the expansion of genetically modified crops			1
earlier breakthrough : dolly the cloned sheep , which was developed by the @entity41 professor @entity42 , @entity13 animal expert at the @entity41 – where @entity44 the sheep was cloned – insisted fears surrounding ‘ @entity47 ’ foods can be overcome			1
@entity49 scientists yesterday called on the government to support the spread of @entity13 into farm animals but admit there will need to be a change in attitude among @entity57 families and retailers			1
they say a new technique of gene editing allows precise changes to be made in animals destined to be eaten			0
professor @entity63 said : ‘ this is a very exciting time			0
we have @entity13 animals that have qualities you ca n’t achieve through conventional animal breeding			2
‘ the problem with @entity13 is that it is seen as mumbo jumbo magic			2
but if people can understand what the aims are and what we are trying to achieve then they are much more comfortable			0
‘ it is an issue for us that the supermarkets decided many years ago not to sell @entity13 food			2
they will have to change what they do , which will be a challenge for them			0
food production is an international business and so @entity13 animals may become acceptable in other countries before it is accepted here			2
’ the @entity3 is expected to approve @entity6 salmon in the next few weeks			1
it is produced by inserting a growth hormone gene and another gene taken from the eel - like ocean pout			0
the fish would be sterile and raised in vast tanks on land rather than in sea cages			0
@entity97 , professor of animal biotechnology at @entity49 , said the main priorities of animal breeding companies are to create disease - resistant animals and manipulate the gender of offspring			0
but @entity105 scientists are also working on creating bigger , faster - growing food animals , he said			0
dr @entity107 of @entity108 , which campaigns to ensure any use of @entity13 is in the public interest , warned : ‘ @entity13 fish escapes could pose a serious threat to wild salmon populations			1
’ an @entity120 move to allow the use of @entity13 animals and insects modified to help destroy crop pests ‘ amounts to engineering whole ecosystems , and no one knows the consequences of this , ’ she said			1
@entity125 , of the @entity127 campaign , said : ‘ we can see no advantages from @entity13 animals in either food production , pest control or disease control			2
‘ we know from in - breeding using conventional methods that this causes huge genetic problems which impact on the health and welfare of farmed animals			0
