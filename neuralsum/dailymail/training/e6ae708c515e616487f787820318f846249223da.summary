by @entity0 last updated at 6:13 pm on 5th march 2012 the former high school teacher who quit his job and left his family to move in with a student 23 years his junior has been branded a sexual predator by a therapist who interviewed the controversial couple			1
@entity9 , 41 , and @entity10 , 18 , made their relationship public last week as it was revealed the pair were moving in together after meeting when @entity9 was @entity10 's business teacher at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
a therapist told @entity18 that the couple are experiencing a common syndrome called ' shared paranoia ' where they think the whole world is against them			1
these teachers imagine themselves to be age mates or peers with the students ' @entity32 said : ' @entity9 is pathologically immature			1
and this is what we see with teachers who have inappropriate relationships with their students			2
they imagine themselves to be age mates or peers with the students			2
' like most sex predators , he is identified age-wise with the victim			1
this is what you see with pedophilia , with offending patterns , with teachers who have sex with students			1
' they always talk about the student as if they and the student are the exact same age			2
@entity9 does what sex offenders often do			1
he disavows culpability while doing the same actions he 's saying he 's not responsible for			2
' the couple insist that nothing inappropriate took place before @entity10 turned 18 and a police investigation is currently underway to discern whether or not this is the case			1
meanwhile , @entity10 's mother has waged a public campaign on @entity73 alleging @entity9 actively pursued her daughter when she was underage and said his actions are tantamount to abuse			1
where it all began : @entity9 quit his job at @entity14 in @entity15 - where his daughter , 17 , is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with @entity10 intimate : the couple share a kiss as they are interviewed by @entity18 and insist their love is real and for life @entity9 's wife and children - including a 17 - year - old who goes to the same school the couple met - are now trying to move on with their lives in the wake of the scandal			1
when ms @entity32 asked @entity9 how he felt about abandoning his family , he accused her of being judgemental saying : ' @entity97 will overcome everything			1
i think that you 're making … judgment calls			2
and i think that we 'll prove you wrong			2
' both insist their love for each other is real and their relationship will succeed			1
ms @entity32 told @entity18 that though it will likely last for a while , eventually one of them will realise the reality of what they are doing			2
' they 're both dropouts at this point			2
she 's a dropout from school and he 's a dropout from society			2
we used to have a diagnosis … called shared paranoia , ' she told the news channel			1
' and that 's when one person makes another person believe that the world is against them			2
' when you make another person believe that the world is against both of you , you create a very powerful bond			0
this is what we see in cults			0
and this is what he 's created with her			0
' concern : @entity10 's mother @entity142 , right , is accusing @entity9 of pursuing her daughter , left , and said what he is doing is tantamount to abuse @entity10 's mother @entity145 is blaming @entity9 for pursuing her daughter and taking advantage of her			1
she claims her daughter 's grades fell this year and she started to have panic attacks ' from the stress '			0
she told @entity151 : ' i was really , really careful			0
i wanted her to be safe			0
in hindsight , in retrospect , i should have looked at things differently			0
' she looked up to him			0
he was in the position of an educator , you do n’t abuse your student			0
' she ’s still in high school			0
she still lives at home			0
' publically naming and shaming @entity9 on her @entity73 page , @entity145 believes @entity9 is just like a pedophile and should spent the rest of his life behind bars			1
love nest : @entity9 left his wife and children to move into one of these apartments with @entity101 - 23 years his junior on @entity179 ' @entity73 account , she posts a picture of @entity9 with this message : ' this is a picture of @entity183 from @entity14 ...			1
a perverted man in his forties , who has taken advantage of a little girl			0
' now , @entity9 if you 're reading this while you have my daughter , you better believe everyone will know you 're a sick child molester			1
' do n't think for one second you will win			0
i 'm smarter , stronger , and way more determined			0
i will never give up			0
' i 'll be getting my daughter back you sicko			0
' @entity10 has now stopped attending classes at the school and is doing independent study			1
she insists that they did nothing wrong until she became an adult and that feelings gradually developed			0
mrs @entity145 does not believe these claims			0
she discovered up to 8,000 text messages exchanged between them , emails and late night phone calls			0
she has now even started a @entity73 campaign against @entity9 , calling him a ' sicko ' and a ' pervert ' mr @entity9 said , though he is being investigated , he is confident that he will be cleared of any inappropriate behaviour , but said he can see why people would be alarmed			1
he told @entity18 : ' i think the stigma of the teacher - student relationship just makes it messy , makes it really hard for people to get through to the point that we really do like each other			1
' we really do want to have a future together			0
