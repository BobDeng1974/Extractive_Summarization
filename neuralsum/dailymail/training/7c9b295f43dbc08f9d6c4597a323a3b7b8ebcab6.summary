by @entity0 while mulled wine and egg nog are the traditional festive tipples of choice , it seems they might have competition this year from an even older beverage - real ale			2
according to sales figures , the barley and hops based brew has enjoyed record sales as people stock up ahead of @entity15			1

popular : sales of real ale have tripled with @entity16 selling 1.5 million bottles in the last seven days alone the reason for the sales boom , say the superstore 's experts , are a growing interest in real ale as an accompaniment to food			1
according to food enthusiasts , pale ale goes well with fish , while malt beer is the perfect partner for turkey and goose , as well as a good alternative for those who dislike wine			2
the popularity of the drink has also been boosted by the @entity44 and the increasing availability of the drink in traditional pubs			2
surprisingly , demand for the drink is highest among younger consumer - a sea change in attitudes given that until recently , ale was considered the preserve of older male drinkers			1
as a result , stores are now stocking a huge variety of different ales , with @entity16 alone increasing its offering from 20 types in 2006 to 350 brews in 2013			2

commenting on the figures , @entity16 ale buyer @entity85 said : ' ale is an ideal match with the @entity15 feast due to its cosy , warming flavours which perfectly complement the roasted , savoury and spicy tastes on offer in the main course as well as with the fruit in the pudding and mince pies plus the cheese and biscuits later on			1
' @entity101 are increasingly producing new and exciting products with connoisseurship in ale rivalling that in wine			2
' with demand growing at its present rate we believe that it wo n’t be too long before restaurants offer up ale lists with their food menus and cheese courses			0
' there has never been a more exciting time to drink beer as the last few years have seen an explosion of small brewers producing exciting new beers , often made with locally available ingredients			0
' sales of bottled ales have been growing steadily since the mid-noughties but this is by far the highest demand we have ever seen in @entity15 week which would indicate that people will be drinking it with their roast turkey			1
' perfect partner : according to @entity16 , malty ales taste wonderful with @entity15 turkey and goose @entity15 dinner does n't have to mean imbibing vats of wine			1
whether you 're tucking into a turkey or chomping on a @entity15 pudding , @entity16 's beer experts have a beer for you			1
fish drink light ales to bring out delicate fish flavours			0
two that are worth a try are @entity146 ( @entity44 champions @entity147 2010 ) or @entity149			0
@entity150 and goose malty ales work best to add to the fuller flavour of these birds			0
suggested matches are @entity156 or @entity157			0
christmas pudding contrast the fruit and peel of the pudding with the chocolate malts of @entity163 ale or the subtle sweetness of @entity165			0
cheese for mild varieties , a light ale such as @entity168 is best , while strong cheeses such as mature cheddar taste wonderful with @entity163			0
those tucking into strong blue cheese should try an aged ale which have have great depth and flavour and are best to cut through the strong mature cheeses			0
@entity178 which was voted the world ’s best ale in 2009 is a good choice , although its worth noting that it has a similar strength to wine and should be sipped like a good port .			0
