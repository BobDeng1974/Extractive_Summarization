by @entity1 correspondent published : 18:15 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 04:08 est , 26 june 2013 @entity3 @entity2 said businesses should prepare for possibility of a ' slight or material change ' in interest rate levels @entity11 's record low interest base rate could be on the way out after more than four years at 0.5 per cent , the new governor of the @entity9 warned yesterday			1
the introduction of a higher rate would be a blow to homeowners and firms used to cheap borrowing			1
@entity3 @entity2 , who takes over from sir @entity19 on monday , told @entity20 a rise was on the cards , adding : ‘ without doubt they need to manage their business for the possibility of a slight or material change in the level of interest rates			1
’ households that are heavily in debt could struggle with increased mortgage repayments and other loans if the @entity9 puts rates up , although savers would be delighted			0
sir @entity19 , who retires after ten years as governor , told mps on the @entity39 : ‘ it is clearly the case that with the prospect at some point down the road of higher interest rates it is not sensible to be in a highly indebted position			1
’ he said some in their thirties and forties had unmanageably large mortgages and would struggle if interest rates rose			1
sir @entity19 used his final public appearance to warn that they had not taken advantage of low borrowing levels to pay off mortgages , instead amassing dangerous levels of debt			1
he said the baby - boom generation had benefited from a steady rise in house prices , but this had forced their children to borrow beyond their means to get on the property ladder			0
sir @entity19 added that this meant those in their thirties and forties would be left in an ‘ unsustainable ’ position if interest rates hit 3 or 4 per cent			1
he told the @entity39 : ‘ the idea we are about to return to normal levels of interest rates is premature			2
one of the reasons we are not about to return is because so many households have such a high level of household debt			0
‘ if there are changes around the world that lead interest rates to go up , then some of those households will have debt that wo n’t look so attractive given the new level of house prices			1
’ but he said rate increases were a long way off , and only after the economy recovered			2
deputy governor @entity92 suggested rates could actually be cut to minus figures to stimulate growth			2
‘ there is nothing special about going into negative territory , ’ he said			0
‘ a reduction in bank rate , including to below zero , remains an option			0
’ however , @entity102 , of the campaign group @entity103 , said : ‘ artificially low interest rates have not produced growth but still these idiotic central bankers want them lower , perhaps even into negative territory			2
’ the @entity9 slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5 per cent in march 2009 and has since pumped £ 375billion of emergency funds into the economy to stop recession turning into depression			2
if the @entity9 increases rates it would be blow to homeowners and firms used to cheap borrowing officials at the @entity9 and the @entity39 believe @entity11 is finally on the road to recovery more than five years after the financial crisis struck			1
but the outgoing governor added : ‘ the recovery is in sight but it is too weak to be satisfactory			2
’ he added that a premature rate increase would kill off the recovery by hammering households and firms unable to deal with higher borrowing costs			2
sir @entity19 also played down the prospect of higher interest rates in other nations , saying ‘ we are nowhere near ’ a return to normal , and that those expecting imminent rate rises ‘ have rather jumped the gun ’			1
he lambasted governments around the world for not using the breathing space provided by central banks to take tough decisions needed to stabilise the global economy			0
outgoing governor sir @entity19 said rate increases were a long way off and only if the economy recovers the eurozone ‘ remains a tremendous problem ’ for the global economy , and in particular @entity11 , he added			1
his comments came as the ailing @entity11 property market was boosted by a 24 per cent rise in mortgage approvals			0
after five years in the doldrums , 7,000 more home loans were taken out in may , compared with the same month last year when 36,102 were approved , according to the @entity156 ( @entity156 )			0
the value of home loans in may was £ 5.5billion – the highest level for 16 months			0
the revival was confirmed by a second study that reported a surge in the number of homes being put on the market for more than £ 500,000			0
the figure is expected to have risen by 19 per cent in the second three months of 2013 compared with a year ago , while it is predicted to have increased 26 per cent in @entity167 and the @entity168			0
an image of @entity170 could replace @entity171 on the £ 10 note an image of @entity175 author @entity170 could be used on a new £ 10 note , it emerged yesterday			0
@entity178 governor sir @entity19 said that the novelist is ‘ quietly waiting in the wings ’ to replace @entity171			1
the move follows the row over the choice of sir @entity184 to take over from prison reformer @entity185 on the fiver , which would have seen a return to an all - male line - up on banknotes			0
the @entity9 has not yet made a decision on when the £ 5 note will be changed or who will be on it			0
but sir @entity19 yesterday told the treasury select committee : ‘ the figure we ’ve been working with for two years is @entity170			1
’ she would be only the third female historical figure to appear on bank - notes since 1970 , following @entity185 and pioneering nurse @entity199			0
the final decision on who will appear will be taken by sir @entity19 ’s successor , @entity2			1
a possible supporter for more women may be mr @entity2 ’s wife , @entity203 , who has campaigned for greater equality and voiced support for the anti-capitalist occupy movement .			2
