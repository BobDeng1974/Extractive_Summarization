asked to nominate his dream strike partner past or present , @entity0 settled on the name of @entity3			1
it is easy to visualise them together , those barn - storming runs of @entity3 and the clever link - up play from @entity0 alongside him			1
in the no 9 and 10 shirts of @entity11 , they would have been lethal			1
‘ i admired @entity3 when i was growing up , ’ admitted @entity0 , as he prepares to lead @entity11 out for a prestige friendly against @entity14 in the @entity15 on tuesday night			1
@entity3 is the @entity11 striker @entity0 would love to have joined up front for his country former @entity18 striker @entity3 celebrates his goal against @entity20 at @entity21 in 2000 ‘ i loved the way he played and he was a real goalscorer , as his record shows			1
i would have worked well with him as a strike partner			1
’ @entity3 scored 30 in 63 appearances for @entity11 , seducing a young @entity0 at a time when he was still making his way through @entity29 ’s centre of excellence			1
partnering them together is the stuff of fantasy , but there will be a dose of reality when @entity36 is added to an exhaustive list of forwards @entity0 has played with since his debut against @entity39 in 2003			2
@entity3 celebrates with @entity41 legend @entity40 after his goal against @entity43 @entity44 also played his first game for @entity11 that night — with @entity0 ’s partners down the years also including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
it is a mixed bag			2
so what does @entity0 , who scored his 47th goal for his country in the 4 - 0 rout of @entity57 on friday evening , look for in a partner ? ‘ i ’ve played with a lot of different players with different qualities and i ’ve adapted to every player , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ with @entity47 i was deeper , leaving @entity47 to run behind , and with @entity64 i tried to stay close — he ’s a big lad who can hold the ball up			2
’ @entity0 played deeper when @entity47 was in the @entity11 team beside him @entity0 tried to stay close to @entity64 when the pair played in the same @entity11 line - up @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity57 in the @entity70 qualifier at @entity21 on friday @entity71 has been forced to change his system in the absence of @entity74 and @entity75 rooney scores from the spot at @entity78 in the @entity79 against @entity80 @entity0 scores during the @entity81 , @entity82 match between @entity83 and @entity11 at the @entity84 @entity85 and @entity0 were in the team to play @entity87 in a friendly at @entity21 in november 2013 @entity51 ( centre ) , at the 2006 @entity90 , last played for @entity11 in 2010 a young @entity0 training beside @entity48 ahead of facing @entity92 in 2003 @entity0 congratulates @entity93 ( no 23 ) after his goal against @entity80 at @entity21 in 2009 for all manner of reasons , including the absence of @entity75 and @entity74 , @entity71 has been forced to change his system for this game against @entity14			1
@entity0 will be at the tip of the diamond , the man responsible for threading those intuitive balls across the box for @entity36 , or to split @entity14 ’s sweeper system by using the pace of @entity52 to get behind them			1
@entity108 laughs with @entity11 players including @entity110 and @entity0 during a team stadium visit a debutant @entity36 celebrates his maiden @entity11 goal in friday 's 4 - 0 win over @entity57 @entity36 is expected to gain his first @entity11 start during the international friendly match against @entity14 ‘ i ’m probably as excited about @entity36 as everyone in the country , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ he ’s had an unbelievable season			0
i ’ve seen the comparisons out there but @entity36 is his own player			0
he ’s good in the air and can shoot with both feet			0
‘ he ’s taking the ball and running at players , which is great to see			0
at the moment he ’s very confident to score			0
‘ there were questions going into the season about where he would play for @entity134 because he was starting @entity136 games , but not the @entity137			0
he gave his manager no option but to play him and he ’s not looked back			0
‘ after scoring his goal on friday i bet he ca n’t wait to get out on the pitch and try to score another goal			0
’ @entity0 is back for more , testing himself against the @entity144 again as he faces them for the first time since @entity11 ’s 2 - 1 defeat in the opening game of the @entity149 in @entity150			1
he spoke yesterday of their uncompromising tactics over the years , but the @entity11 captain is also a big admirer of the football played here , particularly when @entity157 boasted the @entity158 forward @entity159			2
@entity0 admitted he is a big admirer of former @entity161 and @entity157 ace @entity159 ‘ it ’s a passionate country and they love their football , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ they are probably the closest in @entity166 to @entity168 teams			0
they ’ll do anything to stop you			0
they ’re tough to play against , organised , ( and ) make it as difficult to play against as possible			0
they ’re the best in @entity166 at doing that			0
‘ i ’ve never thought about playing in @entity14 but growing up i watched @entity144 football			2
they had some great teams like @entity179 and @entity180 and i loved to watch @entity157 because i loved @entity159			0
’ the @entity158 — fondly known as @entity159 — is one of the game ’s greats , also playing for @entity184 and @entity185 during his 12 - year spell in @entity14			2
the @entity158 is one of the game ’s greats , also playing for @entity184 and @entity185 12 - year spell in @entity14 this is @entity0 ’s year for @entity11 , growing into the role of captain for club and country			1
these days he speaks with increasing maturity and conviction			0
here in @entity202 , as the questions fizzed around over @entity200 ’s startling dip in form , @entity0 recalled a conversation he once had with @entity204 when he was named as a substitute at @entity41			1
@entity200 burst onto the scene , but his form this season has failed to live up to expectation ‘ with @entity29 they hit the heights last season , but he has n’t done as well and the team has n’t done as well recently , ’ added the @entity11 captain			2
‘ i spoke to him after the game on friday night and the only advice i gave him was to watch the game from the bench with @entity11			2
he will know how to get into the opposition , where the spaces are			0
‘ that ’s what @entity204 said to me when i was young , so you know where to be when you come on			0
if it helps , then great			0
