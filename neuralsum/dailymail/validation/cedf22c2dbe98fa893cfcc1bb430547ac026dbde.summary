when @entity1 sold her successful media company for £ 5 million , she set herself two goals : to embark on a new career as a novelist and to find a dream home in @entity7			1
with no previous writing experience , @entity1 knew the former would be tricky – but what she had n’t counted on was how difficult it would be to crack the latter			2
despite viewing countless properties in @entity15 , she and husband @entity13 were left disappointed until they discovered a ruined 15th century monastery in neighbouring @entity18			1
instantly smitten , they swapped their home in the @entity21 for one in the @entity22			0
dream home : @entity1 and her husband viewed countless properties in @entity15 before discovering the monastery in neighbouring @entity18 resurrected : the couple paid just £ 150,000 for the monastery in 2000			1
pictured : the ruins of the monastery ‘ when we went to @entity7 we knew what we wanted – an ancient building that had been completely modernised , ’ says @entity1 , 62			1
‘ there were lots that fitted the bill but something about them did n’t click – they were n’t right			0
‘ then , finally , an estate agent took us to this place and we just knew … ’ all that remained of the monastery was the chapel – minus the roof – and the oratory			1
yet the couple were mesmerised by the building and its location			0
‘ it had views to the @entity52 in one direction and the mountains in the other , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ we got such a sense of peace and tranquillity			0
’ the region also excited them			0
whereas @entity15 is teeming with wealthy second - home - owners from @entity61 , @entity18 is the ‘ real @entity7 ’ – a place where they could mix with the locals			1
back in its glory : after a two - year restoration project , which set the couple back a further £ 1 million , the monastery was transformed into a modern eight bedroom home luxurious : the property also boasts seven en suite bedrooms , a swimming pool and a five - hole golf course			1
pictured : the living room the monastery , near the hilltop town of @entity78 , cost only £ 150,000 back in 2000 but a two - year restoration project on which the couple then embarked set them back a further £ 1 million			1
luckily , the old building had survived until the 1960s , so they were able to find photographs , enabling their architects to recreate the style of original			1
they covered two layers of stone used for the walls in terracotta tiling , just as would have been done in the 15th century , and windows were installed exactly where they were in the pictures			1
behind the facade , the couple built a modern eight - bedroom home with seven en suites , a swimming pool and , for @entity13 ’s benefit , a five - hole golf course in the five acres of grounds			1

she had been toying with an idea for a psychological crime thriller for some time , and by 2010 she had finished her first work , only @entity122			0
then , however , she was faced with another problem : how to find a publisher			0
@entity1 did not fancy the anguish of rejection , so her solution was to self - publish on @entity128 instead			1
at first her novels sold at the rate of only six a week			0
‘ then i thought , “ this is crazy			0
i know about marketing , i ’m going to make this book sell			0
” ‘ i set up a @entity135 account , which now has 12,500 followers , and emailed every blogger and reviewer i could find			0
i spent countless hours on forums and @entity140			0
as a result i changed my life			0
’ @entity1 ’s subsequent success has been astounding			2
a first novel is thought to have done well if it sells 3,000 copies – only @entity122 and follow - up books @entity148 and @entity149 have together sold a million			2
all three have been no 1 bestsellers on @entity128 ’s @entity153 store , and @entity1 now outsells many well - established authors			1
price tag : the couple have now put the property on the market for € 2.5 million ( £ 1.8 million )			1
pictured : one of the bedrooms life in @entity7 has gone well , too			2
the couple have made money by letting out the chapel as a venue for upmarket weddings			2
and with children from previous relationships visiting them , @entity1 and @entity13 ’s house has often been buzzing with guests – just as she had planned			2
but now they have put their home on the market for € 2.5 million – about £ 1.8 million – and want to move to the @entity174 of @entity175			1
‘ we already rent a flat there , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ it ’s a wonderful place – friendly and virtually crime - free			0
as much as we love @entity7 , we now want to buy a property there			0

@entity1 ’s latest book , @entity184 , is out now .			0

@entity1 and her husband bought 15th century monastery in 2000
all that was left of the monastery was chapel ( minus the roof ) and oratory

but a two - year restoration project set them back a further £ 1 million
@entity202 survived until 1960s , enabling architects to recreate original style
but behind the facade , it *'s* a modern eight - bedroom home with seven en suites and a swimming pool
