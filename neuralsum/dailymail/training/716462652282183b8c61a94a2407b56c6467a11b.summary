the authors of a study calling for @entity4 crops to be fast - tracked into @entity6 ’s farms and kitchens all have links to the industry , it can be revealed			1
the report was presented as the work of ‘ independent ’ scientists and was published on thursday by a government advisory body			1
it was used to support a bid to speed up the development of the controversial crops in the @entity6 , but it has emerged that all five authors have a vested interest in promoting @entity4 crops and food – and some are part - funded by the industry			1
opposition : critics of @entity4 described the ' independent ' report as ' biased and downright dangerous '			1
pictured is an @entity30 protest in 2002 critics of @entity4 last night described the report as ‘ biased and downright dangerous ’ , and accused the biotech giants and the government of mounting a crude propaganda campaign to overturn public opposition			1
the academics behind the study were chosen by the @entity38 , the body that advises the prime minister on science policy issues			2
in the report presented at a press conference on thursday , no information was given about the five scientists beyond their names and the institutions they work for			1
they include professor sir @entity48 , from @entity49 , who works as a consultant for @entity4 firm @entity51 , which gives his department research funding			1
@entity51 is behind a genetically modified maize or corn , called @entity55 , which could go into @entity6 farms as early as next spring , making it @entity6 ’s first commercially grown @entity4 crop			1
also on the list is professor @entity59 , of the @entity60 , which is at the centre of @entity6 ’s @entity4 research			1
it is part - funded by former @entity65 science minister , lord @entity60 , who is one of the country ’s biggest supporters of the technology			0
another co-author was professor @entity71 , of the @entity72			0
he was a founder member of @entity73 , which describes its mission as ‘ to make the case for @entity4 crops and foods ’			1
the study suggested @entity4 crops could save the hungry in the @entity81 from starvation and create new plants resistant to disease and pests			1
' sales pitch ' : opponents have questioned whether the scientists ' conclusions are to be believed the authors argued that current @entity92 regulation should be re-drawn to allow the @entity6 to go it alone and plant the crops , even if the rest of @entity95 objects			1
by contrast , the study pulled a veil over evidence of harm to the countryside , insects and wildlife associated with industrial @entity4 farming practices			1
the @entity105 has seen the emergence of superweeds that are immune to some chemical sprays and are now choking fields			0
separately , there has been an absence of research into the health effects of eating @entity4 a spokesman for @entity115 , @entity116 , said : ‘ by no stretch of the imagination can these people be described as independent scientists			1
‘ their views should be treated with the same scepticism we would apply to any sales pitch			0
’ critics say the timing of the release of the study and a supporting letter from the government ’s chief scientist , sir @entity130 , are highly suspicious			2
the details were sent to @entity133 in november – but sir @entity130 and ministers delayed going public until now			0
@entity136 and farming secretary @entity137 , who is a passionate supporter of @entity4 farming , is trying to convince the @entity92 to allow @entity6 to plant @entity4 crops even if other states want a ban			1
the publication of the supposedly independent study calling for exactly this policy is expected to prove useful in those negotiations			2
the director of @entity147 , @entity148 , said : ‘ a group of scientists with financial interests in the success of @entity4 wrote a letter to the prime minister in november but waited four months to tell the @entity155 about it – just in time for @entity92 discussions about regulation			1
something certainly smells a bit fishy			0
’ the administrations in @entity162 and @entity163 have previously made it clear they want nothing to do with @entity4 crops			1
' suspicious ' : the report is being used to speed up the development of @entity4 crops in the @entity6 dr @entity168 , of the group @entity163 , said : ‘ this extraordinary report , published very conveniently to coincide with @entity137 ’s attempts within the @entity92 to dismantle @entity4 regulations and to repatriate powers to the @entity6 , is in turns naive , biased , disingenuous , cynical and downright dangerous			1
‘ we find it incredible that five senior scientists can have been so dismissive of the work of scores of independent scientists who have discovered that @entity4 organisms are directly and indirectly harmful to mammals and to the environment			1
‘ in the world of science there should be respect for those whose findings are “ inconvenient ”			0
’ sir @entity48 yesterday confirmed his connection to @entity51 , but said : ‘ i am independent in that i am not paid a salary by any corporate organisation			0
i do receive funding for research in my lab from @entity51 and consult for them – although i do not receive the fee as it goes to a departmental fund			0
’ prof @entity59 said that while some might question his independence , he was simply ‘ very well informed about @entity4 science and technology ’			2
prof @entity71 said he was a founder of @entity73 , but no longer had any ties to the @entity4 lobby group			2
he added : ‘ i am an independent scientist			0
’ the two other authors were professor @entity207 , of @entity208 , and professor @entity209 , of the universities of @entity49 and @entity211			0
@entity208 is heavily involved in @entity4 research			2
prof @entity207 said : ‘ i greatly value links with industry , particularly at the technology transfer level , and these are completely transparent interactions			0
’ prof @entity209 was co-chairman of the seventh @entity216 , sponsored by @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219			0
he could not be contacted for a comment			0
last night , the @entity221 , which released the report , insisted the authors were independent			1
a spokesman said : ‘ they are not employed by government or industry and each works for different publicly funded universities and research institutes			0
for better or worse , it ’s not unusual any more for universities and institutions to get bits and pieces of funding from government , charities and industry – indeed many can only access public money on condition that they raise a proportion of their funds from commercial or private sources			0
‘ this does not automatically undermine their independence			0
’ but @entity251 chief executive @entity250 said : ‘ it ’s really just not good enough for a group of scientists who have a strong interest , it seems , through their funding sources , in persuading a reluctant public to accept the growing of @entity4 crops in the @entity6 , to be the ones who attempt to write the rule book on how that should happen			1
’ @entity264 @entity59 - @entity60 professor @entity59 proudly wears a t - shirt in his @entity268 page image with the slogan : ‘ @entity4 food ? am i bovvered ? i am not bovvered			1
’ he is group director at the @entity60 , and is also the founder of and adviser to biotech company @entity273 , which counts @entity217 – a @entity4 giant – as a major client			2
@entity275 has been granted more than 20 biotechnology and @entity4 patents			2
@entity275 ’s 2009 annual report noted two collaborative partnerships : one with @entity217 and the other with @entity281			0
professor @entity59 co-founded the @entity6 ’s ‘ first @entity4 crop company ’ , @entity286 , to find ways of commercialising @entity60 ’s @entity4 research into a new type of tomato			1
@entity264 sir @entity48 - @entity49 sir @entity48 is a consultant for the @entity4 crop company @entity51			2
the fees he receives , which are likely to be many thousands of pounds a year , go into a department fund to support his work			0
he was previously the head of the @entity60 , which is part of the @entity295 ( @entity296 ) in @entity297			0
the @entity60 is at the heart of @entity6 ’s @entity4 research			1
it has received millions of pounds in donations from lord @entity60 , a former @entity65 science minister and champion of @entity4 professor @entity48 is also @entity304 at @entity49			2
@entity264 @entity305 a founding member of the @entity308 lobby group @entity73 in 2000			0
the group ’s stated mission is to ‘ make the case for @entity4 crops and foods by helping to achieve a greater measure of realism and better balance in the @entity6 ’s public discussions on agriculture and food ’			1
professor @entity71 says that he has not been in contact with @entity73 since 2002			0
however , he remains an advocate for @entity4 recently , he wrote an opinion piece in which he accused the @entity92 of slowing down the commercial exploitation of @entity4 crops as a result of ‘ unnecessarily tight ’ regulation			1
@entity264 @entity207 - @entity208 he works at @entity208 , which lists biotech firms @entity328 , @entity219 , @entity329 and @entity51 as ‘ partners ’			0
@entity208 , in @entity331 , is hosting a trial to grow @entity4 wheat , which contains genes from the mint plant and gives off a scent that deters pests			2
professor @entity207 suggested the technology could be commercialised to generate money for its developers			0
in 1998 , he was heavily involved in rubbishing research published by professor @entity343 , of @entity345 ’s @entity344 , which appeared to show that feeding @entity4 potatoes to rats had negative effects on the animals ’ stomach lining and immune system			2
@entity352 at @entity353 and visiting research fellow at @entity49 @entity355 has worked closely with sir @entity48 and has links with the @entity60 , the @entity295 , and @entity208			0
@entity358 is the only country in @entity95 in which substantial areas are planted with @entity4 maize			2
prof @entity209 was also co-chairman of the seventh @entity216 , sponsored by @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 .			0
