for nearly a century , the vast hull of the @entity2 ship that sank during the @entity3 has been mostly hidden from view			1
but the violent storms that lashed @entity6 have laid bare the wreck of the @entity8			1
giant waves have stripped away almost 3ft of sand , revealing the steel ribs of the 60ft vessel at its final resting place at @entity15 near @entity16 in north @entity17			1
‘ we ’ve always known there was a wreck there , but had no idea there was this much of it still there until now , ’ he said			0
it was in a fierce storm on october 7 , 1917 that the @entity8 met its fate			1
it is believed that the ship , which was registered in @entity52 , was in @entity54 docks at the outbreak of the war in 1914 and so was impounded			0
three years later it was being towed to @entity34 to be broken up for scrap when it broke free in the storm			1
in a letter to the @entity63 in 1966 , lieutenant commander @entity60 of the @entity61 , recalled his mother ’s eyewitness account of the @entity8 ’s demise			1
‘ the @entity8 went aground on the outer reef , ’ he wrote			2
‘ two @entity69 tugs came from @entity70 to try to refloat her			0
operation : the stricken vessel was eventually washed ashore and was stripped of anything useful - but the 60ft wooden shell was left behind once submerged : the @entity8 was captured by @entity6 forces during the @entity3 and was being towed to @entity34 when it sank on october 7 1917 mesmerising : the relic of the @entity3 is remarkably well after being caked in tons of sand for almost a century @entity81 : parts of the ship can be seen at certain parts of the year but experts say that the recent bad weather has revealed much more of the @entity2 ship than usual discovery : filmmaker @entity36 was enjoying a half - term trip to the idyllic @entity17 beauty spot when he took pictures of the remarkable structure			1
iconic : @entity15 in @entity17 is a remote spot on the north edge of the county 's coastline and adjoins @entity97 , which both feature spectacular rock formations ‘ they got her off the reef , but as soon as they had done so , the towing hawser [ cable ] on each tug parted , @entity8 went ahead out of control and grounded on the inner reef ( only a few yards from the shore as we know )			1
‘ she was there examined by salvage experts … who found no damage whatever to the hull			0
the @entity69 tugs therefore had another try to tow her off , but once more both ship ’s towing harnesses parted			0
@entity8 broke her back and became a total loss			2
but for the unusual misfortune of both towing hawsers parting on two successive attempts @entity8 would in all probability have been salvaged ( as a prize of war , of course )			2
’ the ship was stripped of anything useful and left to rot			2
mr @entity36 made his way to the site after realising that the recent violent storms would have altered the landscape			0
‘ i reckon about a metre of sand has been stripped off this beach and although i have seen some of this wreckage in the past , i have never seen so much as this time , ’ he said			0
‘ the majority of the ship was salvaged and this is all that is left , which is in remarkably good condition from being under the sand all these years			0
’ but it ’s already disappearing again			0
mr @entity36 said the sand was beginning to return			0
these 5,000 - year - old trees have emerged on a beach in @entity148 after peat was washed away during the recent storms scientists knew the forest was there as stumps could sometimes be seen at low tide , but these new remains have appeared further north than the previous sightings discovered : the tank traps were uncovered on rest @entity15 in @entity159 , @entity160 in the aftermath of the storms that have swept the country barricades : they formed part of an enormous line of coastal defences to prevent tanks from advancing inland destroyed : the empty spaces where beach huts used to stand in @entity172 , @entity173 hit the huts : the most exposed shelters were flattened in the storm which hit the beach in @entity178			1

much of the remains of the @entity8 have been hidden since 1917 at @entity15 , near @entity16 , in @entity17
ship was being towed by the @entity61 to @entity34 when it sank and was stripped *leaving* just its hull and masts
series of @entity188 storms *battering* @entity6 has revealed the wreck and also an ancient @entity191 forest
