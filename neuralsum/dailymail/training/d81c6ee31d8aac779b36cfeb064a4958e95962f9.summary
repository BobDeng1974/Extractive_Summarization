supermodel @entity0 has revealed the secret behind her slim and toned body			1
the 31 - year - old mother - of - one shared her favourite fitness regime on her blog for @entity6 - and it only takes 15 minutes			1
despite the short exercise time , @entity0 says it 's an ' intense ' all body work out			1
explaining why she finds the short fitness training beneficial , she writes : ' like most busy working women and mothers , i can find it difficult to fit everything into the day , and more often than not exercise can get relegated to the bottom of the list			1
not only does it give you a great workout , but it also increases your energy levels and improves concentration ! ' the model , who has a three - year - old son with actor @entity36 , said exercise is an important part of her lifestyle and she does n't feel her best unless she 's done something to raise her heart rate			1
as well as regularly doing her 15 minute work out , she said she also loves doing resistance training , yoga classes , hiking or going on a bike ride with her son , @entity47			1
the model recommends people stretch before and after doing her routine and warns them to consult a healthcare professional before trying it if they are new to exercising			1
each of the exercises must be performed consecutively with just 30 seconds recovery in between each move			0
so what does a fitness expert make of @entity0 's routine ? secret to her flat stomach : @entity0 does core stability moves like the plank personal trainer and author of the @entity67 told @entity68 that it 's ' a good solid session on the whole			1
' she said : ' @entity0 has chosen some nice , effective moves for the legs like squats and lunges and great core exercises like plank and leg raises			1
mountain climbers are a brilliant cardio move , those are great for torching fat			1
' to make it more of a full body routine , i ’d have liked to see a bit more balance and a couple more exercises for the arms , back and shoulders as it ’s very core and lower body focused			1
but it ’s not a bad workout at all			1
' even though it 's only 15 minutes long , @entity95 said @entity0 's moves can give the body a decent work out but she recommends people try to exercise for longer more regularly and then do the shorter routine when they are pushed for time			1
she said : ' i 'm all for short , sharp sessions , but there 's a limit to how fit you can get on just 15 minutes training per day , so i 'd recommend longer sessions for most people , most of the time			1
' however , something like this could slip nicely into a schedule for days when time is time and you want a kit - free workout			1
' 1 minute of push ups 1 minute plank ( or 2 x 30 second holds for beginners ) 1 minute of squats 1 minute of jumping jacks 1 minute of left leg raises 1 minute of bicycle crunches 1 minute of right leg raises 1 minute bridge ( hold 30 seconds , pulse 30 seconds ) 1 minute of jumping jacks 1 minute of alternating lunges 1 minute wall sit 1 minute of mountain climbers 1 minute of jumping jacks take 30 seconds recovery between each move @entity135 's moves explained ... @entity136 : @entity138 press ups this is a move that has never gone out of fashion			2
@entity95 explains why : ' press ups are an awesome all - body move , again you 're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position , which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you 're sculpting the chest and arms			1
' to do it , start lying flat face down , position your palms face down under your shoulders and then push up so your body is balanced on your hands and toes and your back is straight			2
@entity95 said : ' a minute of push ups would be pretty challenging for most beginners , but you could do them with your knees on the floor instead of your feet if full push ups are too much			0
' the plank : this move engages your core muscles leading to a tighter , flatter stomach			0
@entity95 explains : ' the plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body , including the deep abdominal muscles			2
it is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises			2
' begin by lying flat face down			0
position your arms under your shoulders and then rise up onto your forearms so your body is balanced on your forearms and toes and your back is straight			2
hold this position for a minute - be warned it is n't easy and you may start to wobble ! hold for 30 seconds to begin with if you are finding it too difficult			1
@entity194 : @entity95 said : ' squats are among the best exercises you can do to firm up and sculpt the legs and bum and they also work the core and back muscles			0
' begin from a standing position and then lower your body , bending your knees as if going to sit down in a chair , when your legs reach a right angle to the floor , push back up to standing and repeat			2
jumping jacks : from standing , do a star jump splitting your legs apart and then jumping back to bring them together			0
at the same time , raise your arms up and apart			2
lunges , left , tone the legs and bottom while press ups , right , are an effective all body exercise @entity218 : made famous by @entity219 , these are great for toning the thighs			1
start lying on your side and raise one leg up and back down again			0
@entity224 @entity223 : these are a different version of sit ups designed to strengthen the stomach muscles			0
lie flat on your back and raise your legs off the floor with your knees bent			0
position your arms so your palms are resting behind your ears			0
then bring each leg in towards your stomach in turn and at the same time , raise your upper body , engaging your stomach muscles to pull you up			1
as you raise , slightly twist to one side so one elbow meets the opposite knee being pulled towards the body			2
bridge : this is another move which will give you a flat stomach and a firm bottom			0
lie flat on your back , bend your knees keeping your feet flat on the floor			0
then raise your body so your weight is on your feet and upper body and your bottom and lower back is off the floor			2
keep your body straight and hold this position			2
when @entity0 says to ' pulse ' for 30 seconds , this means holding the position but squeezing your bottom cheeks and thrusting your hips up and down in small movements			0
@entity264 : from standing , take a step forward and lower your body down till the front leg is at a 90 degree angle to the floor , then push back up to standing			0
for ' alternative ' lunges as @entity0 recommends , take it in turn to step forward with each leg			0
wall sit : this is similar to a squat ( see above ) but done with your back flat against a wall			0
once in the squat position , hold it for a minute rather than continually squatting up and down			0
burn fat : mountain climbers raise your heart rate and tone the stomach mountain climbers : bend down on the floor with your hands palm down and arms straight and then move your legs in a running motion bringing alternative knees up to the chest and straightening the leg again			0
@entity95 said this is another great move for toning and conditioning			0
she said : ' @entity297 climbers are fantastic exercise , offering a total body workout in single “ do anywhere ” move			1
the core is activated to keep the body in position while you power the legs out behind you			0
they are hardcore , but if you want to burn body fat these will definitely get you ignited ! '			0
