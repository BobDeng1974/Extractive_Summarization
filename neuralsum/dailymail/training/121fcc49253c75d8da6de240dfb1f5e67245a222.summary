by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail in the summer of 2012 , ' young and amazed ' @entity2 teenager @entity1 had his photograph taken with @entity4 when the @entity6 superstar stopped by @entity7 in north @entity8 for a training session			1
two years on , @entity1 has already joined the elite club of 100 - metre sprinters who have broken the fabled 10 - second barrier			1
the 20 - year - old 's astonishing 9.96 - second run in @entity16 , @entity17 , on sunday made him the third quickest @entity2 sprinter			1
quick : @entity1 's 9.96 - second run in @entity17 made him the third quickest @entity2 sprinter after he finished sixth in the 2012 world junior 100m final in @entity22 , won by @entity24 's @entity23 , few could have predicted @entity1 would be the first of this talented pair to dip below 10 seconds			1
his rise has come so quickly that @entity1 does not have an agent and the € 3,000 ( £ 2,400 ) in prize - money from sunday 's race was his biggest payday			1
the invitations will come thick and fast and @entity1 is keen to seize the chance to test himself against @entity4 when the world - record holder eventually starts his 2014 season after recovering from a foot injury			1
' most definitely , ' he said			0
' it 's every sprinter 's dream to get on the line with the best people in the world and compete to the best of their ability			2
( @entity4 ) has raised the bar and everybody now feels they can go under the 10 - second barrier			0
' i do n't put any barriers on going sub- 10			0
the times will come , there 's still a lot for me to improve on			0
when people say to me that i 'm among some great guys in history ... it has n't really sunk in			0
' it was not long ago that a 16 - year - old known as ' @entity61 ' or ' @entity62 ' stopped playing football in the local leagues to concentrate on athletics			0
last year he told a national newspaper he would become a rapper if a career on the track did not work out			0
@entity1 , whose parents are of @entity72 descent , studied applied sciences at college , spent a year at the @entity75 and is weighing up starting a degree in business management in september			2
the interim period promises to be a very exciting time not just for @entity1 , but for @entity2 sprinting in general			1
such is the strength in depth over 100m , @entity1 will not represent @entity83 at this summer 's @entity84 in @entity85			2
his 2014 target is therefore to represent @entity24 at the @entity87 in @entity88 in august			0
@entity1 is part of coach @entity91 's promising group of sprinters including @entity93 , 23 , and @entity94 , 22 , as well as @entity97 long jump champion @entity95 , an ' inspirational and motivating ' mentor for @entity1			2
challenge : @entity1 is keen test himself against @entity4 when he recovers from a foot injury and with @entity105 - based athletes such as @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity23 also vying for selection this summer , the men 's 100m at the @entity2 trials later this month promises to be quite a spectacle			1
@entity1 said : ' this is what @entity2 sprinting has needed for a long time now			1
quite a few guys have gone sub- 10.2 and are making the trials look very exciting			0
things are really hotting up in @entity2 sprinting			2
it could be at the stage where the @entity2 trials become harder than getting to a @entity119 final			0
' it 's definitely exciting but i like those moments and hopefully it can bring out the best in me and the other athletes and we can drive each other to superb times and make the world alert			0
' @entity1 is part of the @entity132 - funded @entity131 and is set to compete at the @entity134 's @entity2 championships from june 27 to 29 .			1

@entity1 's 9.96 - second run on sunday made him third quickest @entity2 sprinter
