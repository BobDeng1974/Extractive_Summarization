they all sound like signs of aging that women in their 70s might be worrying about			2
but apparently we all begin to fret about theses physical quandaries much , much , much earlier than that : at the age of just 29			2
yes , a woman 's battle to grow old gracefully begins at the end of her twenties , according to new research			2
growing old gracefully ? saggy boobs become a real worry for women after the age of 29 - the age @entity20 is now - a new study reveals looking good : both @entity20 , left , and @entity25 , right , look terrific at 29 years old , but research shows that is the age when women begin to fret about the physical signs of ageing which means @entity32 , @entity20 , @entity25 , @entity33 and @entity34 - all on the cusp of turning 30 - are likely to already be panicking about age spots , thinning lips and facial hair			1
having spent their teens trying to look older than they actually are , women finally become happy with their appearance in their early twenties			2
but all that changes at 29			2
at 29 women become more concerned about trying to look young again , amid fears of wrinkles , sagging boobs , bingo wings and crow 's feet			1
they also tend to find their first grey hair			1
in fact , some 33 per cent of women fret about going grey , and thinning hair is a major worry for three in 10			1
time delay : is 29 - year - old @entity32 , left , already worried about getting old , right ? a third of women say a sagging bottom keeps them awake at night , while 29 per cent want to avoid a wrinkly cleavage at all costs			1
getting a double chin 13			0
getting crow â€™s feet 15			0
getting age spots on hands 17			0
bigger ears the study shows other top ageing fears for ladies include facial hair , a middle aged spread and thread veins			1
developing double chins , age spots , wrinkly hands and thinning lips also feature in the catalogue of concerns			0
to combat these signs of ageing , the average female reckons she spends up to 12 minutes each day applying the necessary creams and make up			0
that 's the equivalent of 73 hours a year , or three entire days dedicated to the skincare and beauty routine			1
indredibly , more than one in ten women feel they look older than they are by an average of six years			1
but six in 10 ladies feel younger than their years , and claim good make - up and skin care routines cause this			0
indeed , 45 per cent of respondents are lucky enough to regularly receive compliments about how young they look , and believe it is worth making a concerted effort to look younger			0
@entity116 is buying director of @entity118 , the company which conducted the study of 2,000 women			0
mr @entity116 said : ' it is incredible to think that those who are still in the prime of their life at 29 are already worrying about the effect ageing will have on their face and body			0
' that said , it 's really never too early to take care of your skin , and today 's women are lucky that products on our shelves really work			0
' a quick skincare routine started at 29 really will combat the signs of ageing and it 's got to be worth the effort			1
