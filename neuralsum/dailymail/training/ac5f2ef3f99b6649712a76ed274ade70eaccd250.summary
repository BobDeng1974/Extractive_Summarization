his speech comes just months before national elections are due to be held			0
the minimum age for candidates is 25 so he can not stand , but is likely to be a key asset for the ruling @entity20			1
rallying cry : @entity7 , left , addresses a crowd of thousands of @entity20 supporters on the fifth anniversary of his mother 's death shocking story : @entity7 , who has just finished studying at @entity29 , is too young to stand in the elections - but his family history makes him an asset to the party fight on their hands : @entity7 's father @entity36 , right , rode a wave of sympathy to become president after his wife 's death - but the ruling party is losing its hold the party 's popularity has plummeted since it took power nearly five years ago , as the country has struggled with a weak economy and bloody @entity51 insurgency			1
before dawn today , dozens of militants armed with rocket - propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked two tribal police posts in @entity3 's northwest , killing two policemen , with a further 21 officers missing and presumed kidnapped			2
@entity7 was made chairman of the party after his mother 's death but has remained largely in the background until now while he completed his studies in @entity66 , at @entity29			1
his father , president @entity36 , also addressed the crowd in @entity70 village today			2
' i want to tell you that thanks to @entity74 he has completed his studies , but now is the time of his training , ' he said			0
' he has to study @entity3 , he has to learn from you and he has to work according to your thinking , ' the @entity79 has played a prominent role in @entity3 politics for much of the country 's 65 - year history			2
not forgotten : @entity3 policemen stand guard on a roof at the site where former premier @entity88 was assassinated in 2007 born to lead : @entity7 was made chairman of the party after the death of his mother , who twice served as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s @entity7 's grandfather , @entity93 , founded the @entity20 and served as both the country 's president and prime minister in the 1970s			1
he was eventually hanged in 1979 after @entity97 seized power in a military coup			0
@entity88 twice served as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s but never completed a full term			0
her governments were dismissed both times under the cloud of corruption allegations by presidents who were close to the country 's powerful army			0
she was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on december 27 , 2007 , shortly after returning from self - imposed exile to participate in national elections			1
after her death , the @entity20 rode a wave of public sympathy to garner the most seats in the 2008 elections , and @entity36 was elected president			1
but the popularity of both the party and the president has fallen significantly since then as the government has failed to address pressing problems , such as @entity3 's shortage of electricity and stuttering economy			1
complex : @entity88 never completed a full term - her governments were twice dismissed under the cloud of corruption allegations by presidents who were close to the country 's army the government has also struggled in its fight against the @entity3 @entity51 , who have killed thousands of people in attacks throughout the country			1
@entity140 , a political science professor at @entity141 , said it was not a surprise that the @entity20 had unveiled @entity7 in an attempt to boost its fortunes in the elections , which are expected by june at the latest			2
' this is @entity3 and dynastic politics is the norm , ' said @entity140			0
' @entity7 is perhaps the only card left in the chest of the @entity20			2
' both @entity7 and his father sought to whip up the emotions of the crowd by shouting ' long live @entity88 ' and ' @entity88 is alive			1
' supporters waved the red , black and green flag of the @entity20 and held pictures of @entity88 and her father			0
' if you kill one @entity88 , one thousand more @entity79 will emerge , ' said @entity7			2
shocking : @entity88 was killed just weeks after she returned to @entity3 after years in self - imposed exile to participate in the elections he took a swipe at the judiciary , which has clashed with the current government , by asking why people arrested for suspected involvement in his mother 's murder have yet to be convicted			1
but some critics have questioned why @entity7 has not done more to push forward the investigation during more than four years as president			1
the president at the time of his mother 's death , gen. @entity178 , blamed the @entity3 @entity51 for the attack , and five suspected militants are facing trial for alleged involvement in the killing			1
the @entity3 @entity51 have denied the claims			2
a @entity3 court issued an arrest warrant for @entity178 last year over allegations he played a role in the attack , which he has denied			0
arrest warrants were also issued for two senior police officials accused of negligence in the assassination			0
prosecutors accused one of the officials of failing to provide proper security for @entity88 and the other of cleaning the crime scene before evidence could be collected			0
rhetoric : father and son tried to whip up the emotions of the crowd by shouting ' long live @entity88 ' and ' @entity88 is alive ' a @entity206 investigation into the assassination said it could have been prevented and blamed all levels of government for failing to provide adequate security			0
it also accused intelligence agencies and other officials of severely hampering the investigation into those behind her murder			0
the attack on the tribal police posts before dawn today took place in the town of @entity224 in @entity226 province , government officials said			0
the town is near @entity3 's tribal region , the main sanctuary for @entity51 militants in the country			1
security forces have launched an operation to try to recover the 21 missing policemen , said the officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media			0
no group has claimed responsibility for the attack , but suspicion will likely fall on the @entity3 @entity51 .			2
