here , from @entity0 , came a demonstration of what a good international manager can achieve at a @entity4			0
never mind nine points from what was meant to be a difficult group			1
never mind the 10 goals			0
@entity9 can take a midfielder from recently - relegated @entity11 and turn him into a match - winner — as he did with @entity13 only two minutes after sending him on from the bench			1
and he can take a defence that was fairly shambolic against @entity16 , despite winning the game , and reorganise them well enough to withstand the considerable pressure imposed by this stylish @entity21 team			1
@entity21 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity62 6 ; @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 ( @entity65 70 6 ) , @entity66 6 ; @entity67 6 , @entity68 6 , @entity69 7 , @entity70 6 ; @entity71 6 ( @entity72 46 6 ) ; @entity73 7 , @entity74 6 ( @entity75 81 6 )			2
referee : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) 6			0
man of the match : @entity27			2
true , the @entity83 who have dazzled at this tournament did not play with quite their usual intensity in the knowledge that , like their opponents , they were already into the next round			2
it was simply a case of trying to win the group in the hope that this would probably mean avoiding @entity93 in the last 16			1
even so , @entity9 responded to one bad defensive display in a way that @entity96 did not — even though there were enough warning signs against @entity99 to demand action before his @entity102 side met @entity103			0
@entity9 reminded us how tactically astute he is on this occasion , returning to a back five — complete with @entity55 at left back — who defended with a high line to reduce the space that @entity21 like to use			2
@entity23 ’s second goal — a second of the tournament for the impressive @entity40 — was the perfect example of counter-attacking football , the @entity29 breaking from a @entity21 corner and cashing in on the brilliance of the super-quick @entity27			1
net gains : depay wheels away in celebration following his 90th - minute effort crest of a wave : @entity0 and assistant @entity123 have guided @entity23 to three group victories second best : a runners - up finish means @entity21 will now face @entity93 in the last 16 fan - tastic : @entity23 supporters on the @entity129 beach celebrate their victory @entity9 did not appreciate being asked why he had played so defensively in the post-match press conference			1
‘ could you give a definition of attacking football ? ’ he replied			0
‘ that is my question to you			0
if you are going to ask me questions , i am going to ask you questions			0
‘ it was a match of the highest level and the cleverest team won			0
we were able to neutralise @entity21			2
‘ if you look at my cv , you ’ll see that i win a lot of matches			0
i believe that you have to create a strategy to win			0
if it had not worked you would have chopped off my head			0
’ with @entity150 suspended — and therefore no @entity9 in the @entity29 team for the first time since 1996 — @entity9 was forced to make changes which included the curious selection of @entity55 in a defensive role			0
not until the 23rd minute did @entity21 even threaten , @entity71 meeting a corner from the inventive @entity73 with a first - time shot that flew over			1
@entity23 were letting @entity21 have most of the ball			1
but @entity21 were still becoming frustrated and might have had cause for complaint 10 minutes before the end , when @entity164 ’s elbow appeared to spare @entity165 the ignominy of an own goal and what would have been an equaliser			1
in the frame : @entity23 boss @entity0 is photographed during the national anthems close : @entity23 goalkeeper @entity50 watches as @entity73 's shot flies wide during the goalless first half no holding back : @entity68 is upended by midfielder @entity165 grounded : @entity27 was unable to work his magic during the opening period attention : @entity73 is marked closely by @entity54 danger man : @entity68 gives chase to winger @entity27 , who had scored three times in the opening two games no go : @entity182 is tackled by @entity73 as both sides struggled to create after the break @entity185 9 , @entity186 8 , @entity187 7 , @entity188 4 , @entity189 3 , @entity190 3 , @entity191 3 , @entity192 3 , @entity193 3 by then @entity27 had already emerged as the game ’s outstanding player			1
one trademark , 60 - yard run so nearly secured a first - half lead and the @entity200 forward was furious at dragging his shot wide			0
with the changes the future @entity186 manager made came yet more impressive results — fer meeting @entity51 ’s terrific , 77th - minute cross with a thumping header			1
@entity45 then had the legs to keep up with @entity27 and arrive in @entity21 ’s six - yard box at the right time to convert his perfectly - timed cross			1
it means an extra day ’s rest for @entity23			2
video powerful scene as @entity21 fans sing national anthem at @entity4			2

@entity11 midfielder @entity13 opened the scoring with a header two minutes after coming on
@entity192 winger @entity40 sealed the victory from @entity27 's cross in the 90th minute
@entity23 finish top of group with nine points and will avoid hosts @entity93 in last 16
@entity21 will now face the hosts in the second round
