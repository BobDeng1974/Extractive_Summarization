when @entity1 was gifted with a delicious bone to gnaw on , little did she know the challenges she would soon face			0
the three - year - old @entity4 decided to go outside to enjoy her treat one morning , but a huge obstacle stood in her way ... the door flap			1
in this farcical video , taken by her highly amused owner , you can see just how persistent a peckish pet can be			1
at first , @entity1 is standing in front of the backdoor while she grips the center of the bone in her mouth and contemplates his next move			2
she decides to just go for it but finds that she 's unable to fit the bone through the narrow door - flap as it keeps getting trapped in the process			1
after many attempts , she quickly learns that maneuvering it while its in the horizontal position is not going to work due to its width			0
the big challenge : russet the bulldog struggles to fit her wide bone through the narrow door - flap			1
. but she deserves an a for effort so she does what any smart bulldog would do and drops the bone before leaping through the flap alone			2
but do n't fret , she has n't forgotten her prized possession and is hardly ready to give up so easily ! the persistent pet immediately reaches her head back into the house and tries , once again , to yank the bone across from the other side to no avail			0
thinking outside the box : the persistant pet tries from both sides of the flap , but alas , her attempts keep failing flap door ? more like trap door ! but , with much effort and some logical thinking , things suddenly start to click for @entity58			1
she grabs the end of the bone with her teeth , enabling her to drag the bone through the flap sideways			0
success , she 's cracked the code ! let 's hope she remembers his technique so she can bring the bone back home with her			0
clever doggy ! this position is much better and she is finally able to pull the bone outside			0
