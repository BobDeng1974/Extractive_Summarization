@entity0 appears set to disappoint both @entity1 and @entity2 by opting to join @entity3 at @entity4			1
@entity1 officials have been in @entity6 this week in an attempt to lure @entity0 from @entity8 and have tabled a more attractive financial package than @entity4 with a longer contract for the 28 - year - old centre - half , who is available for £ 15million			1
@entity2 has agreed to let his captain leave and restart his career having been out of the team for more than a year and will not veto a move to @entity17 , despite admitting he would rather see him go overseas			1
he has an @entity22 girlfriend , model @entity23 , and a young son , and would like to be reunited with his good friend @entity40			0
he would also have more chance of playing regularly , which is the only factor motivating a move from the @entity43			0
the late interest from @entity1 may at least force @entity4 to increase their bid and help @entity0 secure a longer contract , but the move should be complete before the @entity48 starts next week			1
asked on thursday about a bid from @entity4 , @entity2 smiled before he said : ‘ they could be in the group			1
’ no veto : @entity8 boss @entity2 has admitted @entity4 are among @entity0 's suitors as for the transfer , he added : ‘ it could happen			1
we have sat and talked about it			0
he has shown an outstanding attitude and behaviour but we will not stand in his way if he finds an opportunity			0
’ @entity62 wants @entity0 to operate on the left of three centre - halves in a new - look @entity4 team and @entity2 expects them to feature in a congested title race after finishing seventh last season			1
‘ there could be five or six this year , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ certainly @entity4 will come back into it			2
’ @entity0 ’s exit will force @entity2 into the market to recruit a replacement			1
a defensive midfielder and a centre - half were identified as priority signings at a scouting meeting this week			0
@entity2 is expected to start with @entity78 and teenager @entity79 in central defence for the @entity81 against @entity82 on sunday			2
all smiles : new signing @entity79 looks set to start for @entity8 in sunday 's @entity81 @entity86 internationals per @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 are not due back until monday , while @entity91 defender @entity90 is close to finalising a move to @entity93			1
in the past @entity94 may have been moved into the centre but the right back is the latest to take the well - worn route from the @entity43 to the @entity98			0
‘ i made him a proposal to stay for three years and he chose @entity82 , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ it looks to me like he agreed it a long time before			0
ideally i would have loved him to stay but he was super-professional until the last day of his contract and i respect that			0
’ @entity94 has followed @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 to @entity82 but @entity2 believes @entity110 ’s @entity109 rules , brought in to stop clubs spending more money than they earn , are levelling the market and will make such a move more difficult in future			0
@entity118 claimed yesterday that they had pulled out of talks to sign @entity120 from @entity121 because it was too expensive , and @entity82 have spent less than @entity8 in this transfer window			2
‘ we are less vulnerable for sure , ’ said @entity2 .			0

@entity0 will opt to join @entity4 over @entity1
