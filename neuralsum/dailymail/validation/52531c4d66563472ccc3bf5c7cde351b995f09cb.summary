saving the lives of premature babies is not always the most kind course of action , doctors have been told			2
new guidance says health professionals should carefully consider whether medical intervention is in the baby 's best interest , and should n't be carried out ' just because the technology is there '			0
continuing treatment to keep the baby alive can sometimes actually cause greater suffering , child health doctors said			2
doctors should carefully consider whether saving the lives of premature babies is the kindest course of action , new guidance from the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) says the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) today released a new framework , which advises doctors on how to care for children and babies with life - limiting and life - threatening conditions			1
it asks medics to weight up the benefits of prolonged treatment versus the suffering the young patient might be likely to experience			1
it says seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue receiving treatment which is keeping them alive			1
the updated information provides three sets of circumstances for when limiting or withdrawing the treatment of children and babies can be considered			1
this can be done when life is limited in quality or when life is limited in quantity			0
treatment can also be limited or withdrawn when there is ' competent refusal of treatment ' - if an older child with extensive experience of illness repeatedly consents to stopping their medical care			1
the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) advises doctors on when to treat children and babies with life - limiting and life - threatening illnesses			1
it says life - sustaining treatment can be limited or withdrawn when : for example , a child that has undergone repeated cycles of chemotherapy or had organ transplantation , ' will have more informed views about continuing treatment than an adult facing such treatment for the first time ' , the document says			1
but it adds that , equally , children may not have any experience in decision making and it therefore may not be as appropriate for them to be involved			0
written by medics , lawyers and ethicists , the framework was published to provide an ethical and legal framework for doctors			0
since the last version was published 10 years ago , major breakthroughs in medical science have led to better survival rates for seriously sick babies and children			0
babies born at 22 or 23 weeks are now surviving			0
but child health experts said that just because the technology is there , it does not mean it is necessarily in the child or baby 's best interests to use it if their circumstances fall under any of the categories set out			0
dr @entity100 , a consultant neonatologist and vice president of the @entity20 , said the document sets out a ' better and more family - friendly process '			2
' for some , continuing life - sustaining treatment is simply prolonging suffering in the face of the inevitable , ' he said			1
seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue treatment that is keeping them alive , the guidance adds ( file photo ) ' in these cases , an active decision is reached among the clinicians , parents and other parties to discontinue treatment rather than cause greater suffering for the child by keeping them alive			1
' the better informed the family or the patient themselves is , the better , he said , and more children and babies are receiving palliative care in hospices or at home rather than dying in hospital			2
dr @entity130 , consultant in paediatric and neonatal intensive care at @entity132 ( @entity132 ) and chairman of the @entity134 at the @entity20 , said : ' this is a sensitive and challenging area of medicine			0
' the guiding principle remains to act in the best interest of the child , actively involving them in the decision making where possible , and of course considering the interests of the families and their rights			0
' decisions to limit treatments should be made by clinical teams in partnership with , and with the agreement of , the parents and child			0
