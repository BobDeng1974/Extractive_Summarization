police estimated the damage caused to the store at more than £ 41,000			1
detectives later proved the group had carried out a reconnaissance run to the jewellers in the weeks previously and had aborted an attempt at the raid the day before it was targeted			2
sentencing the gang today , @entity142 described the @entity7 raid as ' a professionally planned and carefully executed robbery '			1
