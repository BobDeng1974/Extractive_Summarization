by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a @entity4 paedophile who is described as ‘ every parent ’s nightmare ’ has escaped being sent to jail			0
@entity8 , 34 , appeared the perfect middle - class husband yet groomed hundreds of children on the social networking site			1
by posing online as a privately - educated teenager , he persuaded girls as young as 12 to film themselves naked for his twisted pleasure			1
alias : using the name ' @entity17 ' and this picture of him as a younger man , @entity8 forced girls to film themselves @entity8 , who is married to an @entity22 - educated lawyer although they have been separated for over a year , would threaten to tell the girls ’ parents if they tried to end the vile abuse			1
despite being convicted of eight child sex charges , he was given only a three - year rehabilitation order			1
mps and charities said the ‘ appalling ’ sentence sent out a terrible message to the young victims brave enough to give evidence against him			1
the case was last night referred to attorney general @entity37 by @entity39 mp @entity38			1
he said : ‘ the sentence is woefully inadequate and out of touch with the increasing dangers of online sexual abuse			1
’ the mp has backed the @entity46 ’s campaign for automatic blocks on online porn unless adults opt out			0
to his family and friends , @entity8 was an ordinary young man with a love of beer and cricket and married to the love of his life			1
they had a dream wedding in 2010			0
behind the facade he was secretly spending hours on @entity4 , posing as a wealthy and sporty prep school teenager called @entity17			0
on his fake @entity4 profile , @entity8 claimed he left @entity62 – an independent boarding school which charges up to £ 27,000 a year – in 2011			1
dozens of teenagers can still be seen as his friends on @entity4 , many of them posing in provocative clothing			0
@entity8 lists ‘ sexercise , girls and naughtiness ’ among his interests			1
the police investigation began last year when a 14 - year - old girl told officers a @entity17 had sent her sexual images via @entity4 two years earlier			0
she said he asked her to send sexual images in return			0
officers at @entity79 ’s specialist child exploitation unit quickly discovered that @entity8 was responsible for the account			1
when police raided his home they discovered he had falsely amassed almost 800 @entity4 friends , all of them girls aged under 18			2
he had sent hundreds of private messages to them asking them to send him explicit images of themselves and sent images of his genitals in return			0
they discovered another victim , a 13 - year - old girl , was encouraged to set up a @entity96 account which he used to make her strip and display intimate parts of her body			0
the girl said she was scared and believed @entity8 knew where she lived and would tell her parents			1
the girl confided in a 13 - year - old friend who told @entity8 to back off			1
but , in a chilling twist , this girl and another friend became his victims too			0
after raiding @entity8 ’s home in @entity111 , @entity112 , police discovered more than 3,000 saved pages of @entity96 chat which helped them identify further victims			2
seventy - two indecent images of children were found on a laptop and on @entity8 ’s @entity120 mobile phone			2
he admitted eight counts of inciting children to engage in sexual activity and two counts of making indecent images of children			0
@entity8 , who is originally from @entity127 , @entity128 , was sentenced to a 36 - month sex offender ’s programme at @entity131 on monday			1
he was also handed a sexual offences prevention order , which is similar to an @entity133 , and ordered to sign the sex offenders register for five years			1
under the latest guidelines , the maximum penalty for inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity is 14 years behind bars			2
@entity8 was sentenced to a 36 - month sex offender 's programme at @entity131 on monday this is reduced substantially if there is no physical contact			1
but mr @entity38 said : ‘ the impact of predators on child victims is the same whether online or in person			2
sentences should reflect that equivalence			0
’ @entity151 , another @entity39 mp , said : ‘ it is appalling that such a soft sentence has been given for what is overt internet grooming and dangerous behaviour that threatens the safety of our children			2
‘ this reflects the failure in our criminal justice system when it comes to dealing with the internet			0
‘ we need firm and clear sentences to be handed out to individuals who are clearly abusing youngsters in such a horrific and vile way online			2
’ @entity172 , of the @entity171 on internet safety , said : ‘ @entity8 is obviously a dangerous man and a lot of people will be surprised with the leniency of this sentence			1
‘ a lot of people will think he should be in prison			0
people are noticing that fewer and fewer of these offenders are going to jail			0
it seems there has been a shift in sentencing process without a change in sentencing policy			0
’ detective inspector @entity189 , who investigated the case , believes @entity8 claimed many more victims			1
‘ he is every parent ’s nightmare , exploiting and abusing children over the internet , ’ he said			0
‘ the victims showed much courage in coming forward to report his activities and helping to bring him to justice			0
' the impact on child victims is the same whether online or in person			2
sentences should reflect that ' mp @entity38 ‘ he is a serial sex offender who i believe may have abused other victims who have not yet come forward and spoken to the police or confided in anyone else			2
’ the case is the latest to highlight the frightening trend of paedophiles using @entity4 and other sites			2
the government has been warned that social networking and webcams are handing predators direct access to the bedrooms of naive children .			0
