a baby boy suffered severe brain damage after midwives failed to notice that he was dangerously jaundiced after his birth			1
@entity4 , now 19 months , was born perfectly healthy and allowed home the following day			1
over the next four days he was seen five times by three midwives , who told his parents , @entity9 and @entity10 , that his jaundice was nothing to worry about			1
@entity13 , who is now 19 months pictured with his mother @entity14 and his father @entity15 was born perfectly healthy but suffered severe brain damage after developing jaundice after birth in fact , his level of bilirubin – a noxious substance that turns the skin yellow and can damage the brain – was soaring			1
not until mrs @entity10 , 32 , called her local hospital to say her son was arching his back as if in pain did anyone suggest bringing him in			1
he was finally put in intensive care and given a transfusion			1
but by then , the bilirubin had caused a rare form of brain damage known as kernicterus			1
it means doctors are uncertain whether @entity4 will ever walk or talk , and he is likely to need 24 - hour care all his life			1
now , his devastated family are speaking about their ordeal for the first time to warn other parents of the dangers			0
last night mr @entity4 , 41 , an electrician , said : ‘ we feel so disappointed , so let down and heartbroken			2
@entity4 was born a healthy baby boy and , although he had a bit of jaundice , we were reassured by the midwives at each visit			1
‘ the midwives did n’t seem to know this could happen			0
we feel a sense of loss , loss because my wife gave birth to a healthy child who was taken from us at five days old			0
’ the substance bilirubin , which causes jaundice , had caused @entity4 to suffer from a rare form of brain damage known as kernicterus mrs @entity10 , a florist , gave birth to @entity4 , her fifth child , at @entity66 last year and midwives suggested taking him out in the sunshine to help his jaundice jaundice , or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes , is caused by excess bilirubin			1
the chemical is produced as red blood cells break down , and is normally removed from the blood by the liver			0
because newborns ’ livers are not fully developed , six out of ten will suffer jaundice to some extent			0
mrs @entity10 , a florist , gave birth to @entity4 , her fifth child , at @entity66 on april 15 , 2013			1
he was seen by three midwives at home in @entity88 , near @entity89 , and they suggested taking him out in the sunshine to help his jaundice			2
but by the evening of april 20 , the jaundice had spread			0
@entity4 had problems feeding and was arching his back and neck unnaturally			2
the @entity95 rang the local hospital			0
doctors did a blood test , but then told the couple they would have to drive @entity4 and his blood sample to @entity66 in their own car			1
doctors are uncertain whether @entity4 will ever walk or talk , and he is likely to need 24 - hour care all his life on arrival , mr @entity4 said , countless tests were carried out until a senior consultant was called in – and quickly realised jaundice was to blame			1
@entity4 had a transfusion to replace half the blood in his body and spent a week under special lights that break down bilirubin			2
then , the consultant told them to prepare for a serious brain injury			2
jaundice is the condition which refers to a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by a build - up of bilirubin the blood and tissues of the body			0
bilirubin is a waste product that 's produced when red blood cells break down			0
it is transported in the bloodstream to the liver jaundice can also be a side effect of liver damage , cirrohsis , gallstones , tumours , malaria and sickle cell anaemia			2
newborn babies are often born with the symptoms of jaundice , but usually in the young it resolves itself without treatment			2
maintaining a healthy weight and managing alcohol intake can reduce the risk of developing the condition			0
source : @entity151 ‘ our world dropped away , we were just devastated , ’ mr @entity4 added			2
bosses at the @entity155 and @entity156 wrote to the family in september , apologising for the ‘ failures ’ that caused @entity4 ’s brain damage			1
the @entity95 are seeking compensation , expected to run into seven figures			0
‘ no amount will ever compensate for what happened , but we want to make sure @entity4 is looked after when we are gone , ’ mr @entity4 said			0
he added : ‘ it ’s very difficult for us to see other families with their children running around , knowing @entity4 is unlikely to ever play with his siblings in that way			0
‘ we just want to warn other parents about the risks and ensure the hospital makes whatever changes are necessary to prevent this from happening to any other child			0
’ their lawyer @entity177 , of @entity179 , said : ‘ the lack of appreciation of the danger @entity4 was in would suggest there are training issues at the hospital trust that need to be addressed urgently			1
’ in a letter to the family , @entity186 , chief executive of the trust , admitted @entity4 did not ‘ receive the treatment he should have done ’ , adding : ‘ i would like to offer my sincere apology and deep regret for those failures			0
’ trust spokesman @entity194 said : ‘ lessons have been learned to ensure the risk of this happening again is minimised			0

staff told @entity9 and @entity10 that baby @entity4 's jaundice was normal
he was born perfectly healthy and allowed home the following day
but the substance causing his jaundice was also damaging his brain
eventually he was taken to hospital and put into intensive care
@entity4 had suffered from a rare form of brain damage and its uncertain if he will ever walk or talk
