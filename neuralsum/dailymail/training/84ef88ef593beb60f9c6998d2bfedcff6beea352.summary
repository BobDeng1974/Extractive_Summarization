could chilly fertility pants help you conceive a child ? plenty of things are better when served chilled : white wine , ice cream , gazpacho , testicles ... pardon ? strange as it may sound , for men who are trying to conceive a baby the ideal environment in which to store their little swimmers is one cooled to a temperature slightly below core body heat			1
so now one forward - thinking @entity18 - based man ( who has suffered fertility problems of his own ) has invented a pair of men 's underpants that keep things downstairs chilly in order to maximise the chances of conceiving			1
@entity29 @entity28 's patented ' snowballs ' pants come with a special integrated pocket that cools a man 's nether regions in effort to boost his sperm count			1
@entity28 , 38 , a full - time writer who was headmaster of @entity36 of @entity37 for 5 years , himself spent lots of money and suffered endless heartache going through the ' fertility factory ' with his wife			2
originally from @entity44 , @entity43 came up with the idea for snowballs after a friend of his was told by a doctor to cool his genitals in order to help him conceive a baby			0
on his @entity54 webpage - through which he is attempting to net us $ 20,000 ( £ 13,361 ) of funding before 4 april in order to produce and market the underpants - @entity43 explains how he and his friend became obsessed with the idea of how heat affects male fertility			1
it had been a painful year			0
there had been a silent miscarriage after two years of trying , and the best doctor that money could buy had said that their chances were now zero			0
' @entity43 continues : ' they ignored his advice and saw another doctor , and then another , until finally one gynecologist took the time to sit down with them and listen carefully			0
' almost immediately , he had a new plan			0
first , my friend should begin icing his balls			0
huh ? and then he should have himself tested for a varicocele			0
again , huh ? ' the cooling gel packs that slip inside the @entity98 ' special pocket to chill a man 's testicles @entity28 , left , has created @entity98 underpants , to optimise a man 's chances of conceiving varicoceles are enlarged veins in the scrotum that bring more blood and raise scrotal temperatures			1
when @entity28 's friend began icing his testicles , he and his wife conceived a daughter			2
speaking to @entity113 , @entity28 said : the studies showing that icing works are pretty recent , and we 're just starting out , but there is no doubt that heat kills sperm , and that icing prevents that			1
' i imagine we 'll have some additional testimonials pretty soon , but in fertility science , like in most science , it 's difficult to isolate any one factor			0
' as we say on the site : " we believe in miracles , but do n't count on snowballs to work ' miracles '			0
they should increase both sperm quality and quantity , and they should give you a better chance to conceive at minimal cost , but fertility science is complex , and you 'll also want to consult with a urologist ( for varicoceles ) , as well as your fertility specialist			2
' if @entity43 accrues enough funding , each order of snowballs will include three pair of specially designed underwear , three unique @entity148 , and a guide to what else you can be doing to maximize your chances at fatherhood			2
market price will be somewhere between $ 65 and $ 80 ( £ 43 - £ 53 ) , and those who donate on @entity54 will receive a discount			1
@entity28 's @entity54 page , through which he needs to generate $ 20,000 of funding for the @entity98 pants			1

sperm is *happiest* ( and most *efficient* ) at a cooler temperature
@entity29 @entity28 , based in @entity18 , has patented ' cooling ' pants
now hopes to raise $ 20,000 funding via @entity54 website
