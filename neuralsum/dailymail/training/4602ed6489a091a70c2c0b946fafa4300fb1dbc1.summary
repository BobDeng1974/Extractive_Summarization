an ancient plant believed to have last flowered outside in the @entity2 when dinosaurs walked the earth has bloomed again - and it 's down to global warming			1
the @entity6 first appeared on @entity7 in the @entity9 period more than 190 million years ago			1
it may have flowered inside before as it is still kept as a popular houseplant			0
but botanists studying the evergreen could find no record of it blooming outside - but in half a century it could be a common occurrence			2
they say they have achieved the impossible thanks to climate change			2
out of the ordinary : it was possible for the plant to mature because winters have been getting milder			2
' it 's not like the @entity24 times when the @entity25 would freeze over , ' said curator @entity26 remarkable : a visitor at @entity29 eyes the ancient @entity31 plant			2
it is not thought to have flowered outdoors in the @entity2 since @entity9 times climate change : botanists think the plant 's blooming could be down to global warming			1
in 50 years the event could be commonplace experts at @entity29 , on the @entity41 , have been growing nine @entity6 plants , also known as @entity43 , for a decade			1
they were stunned when a 20cm flower , which looks like a pine cone , appeared among the foliage at the beginning of this month			1
it comes ten years after a fossilized version of the plant was found in rocks close by in @entity29			1
curator @entity26 dubbed the development a ' landmark '			0
he said : ' we put these plants outside to see how they they would grow as part of an experiment			0
' in the last ten years they 've gone through one of the coldest winters for 30 years and survived			1
' they 've continued to produce a new flourish of leaves once a year			0
' but this year one has produced a flower , which is incredibly rare			2
it 's hard enough to grow them inside , let alone outside			0
' this is probably the first time it has happened outdoors since the @entity9 period			1
' we were nâ€™t expecting it at all , when they produced leaves we did n't expect any to go on to the next stage and flower			0
' it means the conditions are perfect for them and it 's due to climate change			0
' it 's a real milestone for us			0
' amazed : the botanists could not believe their eyes when the plant produced the flower			1
it looks like a 20cm cone			0
they admitted it was hard enough to grow one indoors @entity26 believes if the climate continues warming , the plant could become a common feature in gardens			2
he added : ' this is n't the type of plant that would have grown outdoors 25 years ago			1
' but it 's possible now because we are getting milder winters - it 's not like the @entity24 times when the @entity25 would freeze over			0
' the @entity6 likes heat and the micro-climate here on the @entity41 is quite different to the rest of the @entity2 - we 're several degrees warmer			1
' we planted it on a south - facing plot where it was sheltered and got the most heat and sunlight			0
he added : ' it 's a real landmark			0
in 50 years time we could see this plant flowering in gardens all over the @entity2			1

@entity6 not bloomed outdoors for millions of years , botanists say
they were amazed when the 20cm flower appeared among the foliage
@entity125 achieved ten years after a fossil of plant was found *nearby*
@entity6 could be flowering in gardens across the @entity2 in 50 years time
