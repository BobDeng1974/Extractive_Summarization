@entity2 's wife has not spoken to him since explosive documentary , @entity3 , aired and is now living with his lawyer , it has been revealed			1
in the aftermath of the documentary , which outlined the life of real estate scion @entity2 and his possible involvement in multiple murders , many wished to know more about his wife of 15 years , @entity12			1
@entity12 , a self - made real estate executive , was briefly featured in the documentary in a clip from years earlier as she gave testimony to police pertaining to the her husband 's murder of @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , but other than that did not participate in the film			1
now it has been revealed that @entity12 not only advised @entity2 against participating in the documentary , but also has not spoken to him since it premiered and has been living with his lawyer			1
this as the final episode featured audio of @entity2 possibly admitting to committing these murders , saying he ' killed them all ' during a moment when the cameras were off but his microphone was still on			0
@entity12 and @entity38 were even photographed together at a @entity48 event in 2010 , though the extent of their relationship is not known and @entity12 refused requests for comment from the paper			2
authorities are now looking to question @entity12 as they believe her husband is responsible for murdering his friend @entity41 on christmas eve of 2000 , just two weeks after he wed @entity12			1
the incident occurred shortly after @entity41 , a lifelong confidant of @entity2 , contacted the man to let him know that police wished to speak with her regarding the disappearance of his first wife @entity60 in 1982 , who to this day has never been found			2
many believe @entity2 also knows about the disappearance of his first wife @entity60 ( above ) who was last seen in 1982 both @entity2 and @entity12 have previously revealed that they were only married so that she could receive his estate and inheritance should he die , and so the money would not go back into the family business			2
@entity2 remained upset that his father @entity69 had selected his younger brother @entity70 to run the @entity71 in 1994 , and thus did not want the $ 2million he received every year from a trust to go to the company should he die			0
' it was our understanding that unless i was married to him , i could n’t benefit from any of the trusts , ' @entity12 said in a deposition while being questioned about the @entity20 incident , in which her husband was ultimately found by a jury to be acting in self defense when he shot the man and then dismembered his body			0
because of their marriage however , @entity12 can not be compelled to testify against her husband as he faces possible new charges in the death of @entity41 , and even if she did , @entity2 would likely have her testimony blocked			1
@entity12 , who wed @entity2 ( above in his booking photo following his arrest for the @entity20 murder ) in 2000 , is said to have advised @entity2 against doing the recent documentary @entity3 meanwhile , reports that @entity12 could also face aiding and abetting charges stemming from @entity2 's recent arrest in @entity95 as authorities believe he was trying to flee the country for @entity98 , seem to be unfounded as she not only was not speaking to to him at that time but also was not responsible for sending him the $ 117,000 in cash that arrived shortly after he was taken into police custody on a warrant from @entity103 who wished to extradite him and charge him with murder in the death of @entity41			1
that money it seems came from another woman in @entity109 , who sent it to @entity111 in luggage that was also filled with shoes after he called her upon his arrival in @entity95			0
@entity12 has never said much about her husband , frequently refusing to comment about the man who she met at a real estate dinner in 1988 , and has kept a very low profile in recent weeks as new charges have been brought against him			1
in addition to the murder charge in @entity121 , he also faces charges in @entity95 as he had a gun and sizable amount of marijuana on him at the time of his arrest			2
when @entity2 was arrested for murdering @entity20 however , @entity12 was the first person he called ; handling his money , helping him decide what lawyer to hire and frequently flying to @entity22 for the trial			0
and while much has been made of @entity2 's tragic childhood and his mother 's death by suicide when he was just a young boy , @entity12 had an equally troubling youth			2
her parents both came from @entity137 having survived the @entity138 , her father losing his foot in a landmine explosion and her mother , an orphan , having been taken in and hidden by a @entity144 family			0
@entity12 worked hard to make herself a success , once noting ; ' i knew if i could n’t be a star , i would n’t be happy			0
' along the way she made many friends , and more than a few foes , in the industry			0
both @entity2 ( above ) and @entity12 admit that they only wed so she could eventually receive @entity2 's inheritance , though she also now can not testify against him in court @entity2 was said to be drawn to the fact that she had worked her way up in the male dominated industry , and helped her out financially as she went through a difficult divorce and custody hearing as well as numerous lawsuits from agents who claimed they had not received their promised commission from @entity165			1
she remains involved in real estate now , having recently taken her $ 20million share of @entity2 's $ 65million settlement from his claims against his family trust , to start a new company with her son , who she reconnected with roughly 10 years ago after not having spoken to the boy for 15 years			1
they have an investment office in the @entity177 section of @entity178 , and @entity12 also recently sold the @entity180 apartment @entity2 helped her to buy in 1997 and the @entity182 home the two shared			0
@entity2 meanwhile is being held in a psychiatric correctional center outside @entity95 .			0

@entity2 's wife @entity12 is reportedly no longer supporting the millionaire real estate scion as he faces new murder charge
@entity2 is expected to be charged with first - degree murder in the death of his friend @entity41 , who was killed on christmas eve 2000
@entity12 , who wed @entity2 in 2000 , is said to have advised @entity2 against doing the recent documentary @entity3 , and has not spoken to him since
she is also reportedly living with one of @entity2 's lawyers , @entity38
@entity12 , the *daughter* of @entity137 *immigrants* who escaped the @entity138 , met @entity2 in 1988 and the two wed in 2000
both admit that they only wed so @entity12 could eventually receive @entity2 's inheritance , though now she can not be compelled to testify against him
