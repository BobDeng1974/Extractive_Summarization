by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:43 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:11 est , 3 september 2012 president @entity3 has insisted he was n't offended by @entity6 's @entity5 jibe in which the movie star interrogated an empty chair that he said represented the nation 's leader			1
' one thing about being president or running for president - if you 're easily offended , you should probably choose another profession , ' @entity3 told @entity15			1
the legendary @entity17 actor stole the show at the @entity5 and sparked an internet craze now known as ' @entity20 ' after he had a heated , and hilarious , discussion with an invisible @entity3 , grilling a chair about the president 's legacy			1
' i think the last few movies that he 's made have been terrific , ' he added			1
he also praised @entity38 's business career , describing his @entity5 rival as ' incredibly successful ' as well as ' disciplined and hard - working '			1
however , mr @entity3 had harsher words for his @entity43 rival 's healthcare plans , saying they could be summarised as ' @entity38 does n't care '			1
the president said : ' you know , he calls it @entity47			1
' i do n't know exactly what the other side is proposing - i guess you could call it " @entity38 does n't care "			1
but this law is here to stay			2
' in a fierce defence of his controversial reforms , mr @entity3 said : ' governor @entity38 promised that on his first day in office he 's gon na sit right down , grab a pen and repeal @entity47			1
' what that means is that right away he 'd kick 7 million young people off their parents ' plan			2
he 'd take hope away from tens of millions of @entity64 with pre-exiting conditions by repealing reform			2
' prime - time jibe : @entity6 , pictured during his speech on thursday , stole the show at the @entity5 and sparked an internet craze now known as ' @entity20 ' after his heated discussion with an invisible @entity3 @entity3 's response to @entity6 's speech was the most re-tweeted tweet of the @entity5 convention , a @entity73 spokesman told @entity78			1
it was the president 's second most re-tweeted tweet of all time , after his note a few months ago showing his support for gay marriage			1
as of today , more than 51,000 people had re-tweeted the picture of the back of @entity3 's head in the grandiose leather chair embossed with his title , with a message saying ' this seat 's taken			1
' while the president was expressing his approval of @entity6 's performance , other leading @entity93 were far less complimentary towards last week 's @entity43 convention			1
@entity98 , the mayor of @entity99 who is chair of the @entity93 ' convention , said the @entity5 plan for office ' looks like the platform of 1812 '			2
in an appearance on @entity105 , he added that ' @entity106 would be turning in his grave ' over the @entity43 's current agenda			1
campaign aide @entity109 went even further , suggesting that the convention shows @entity43 ' think lying is a virtue '			2
most re-tweeted : @entity3 's response to @entity6 's speech , which featured this photo , was the most re-tweeted tweet of the @entity5 convention @entity118 , the president 's combative former chief of staff , was also on the attack , saying that mr @entity38 's speech had ' nothing memorable ' about it			1
but other @entity3 allies were forced to be more defensive , with @entity126 governor @entity125 admitting that @entity64 were not ' better off today than they were four years ago ' in an interview on @entity129 's @entity128			1
and @entity130 , former governor of @entity131 , resorted to arguing that mr @entity3 would win the support of ' the international community ' in his re-election attempt			0
these remarks all came as hundreds of protesters marched on ' @entity137 ' in @entity138 , @entity139 , and the town ramped up security ahead of the @entity142			0
about 600 marchers carried signs and banners , including one accusing @entity3 of murdering children with drones , yesterday afternoon but the lively demonstration was a fraction of the size organisers had hoped			0
placards : demonstrators walk during the ' @entity154 ' protest rally : hundreds of protesters marched through @entity138 's central business district today ahead of the @entity142 the march 's general purpose was to decry corporate greed , but it drew people demonstrating for a variety of causes			1
meanwhile , hundreds of law enforcement officers from across the country descended on the @entity166 , getting ready for the convention , which officially starts on tuesday			0
@entity138 - @entity169 police have n't said exactly how many officers are being brought in for the event , but they said they are ready for any challenge that may present itself			1
' we have ( officers ) in all areas and all facets of the venues , the traffic assignments , the different visits , the routes people can expect to see different colored patches and uniforms from all over the place , ' maj. @entity173 told @entity186 1			0
there will be countless security hotspots in @entity138 during the convention but the most secretive is a 17,000 - square - foot office building near the airport , where more than 50 agencies will house their representatives , according to @entity194			0
the building , filled with tables , chairs and big - screen tvs , is called the @entity200 and is the guts of the @entity64 government , the website claims			0
it will house staff from the @entity205 to the @entity206 to the @entity207 from today			0
angry : about 600 marchers carried signs and banners , banged drums and chanted on a sunny afternoon as part of the march on @entity137 costumes : a demonstrator wears a pig snout occupying @entity216 in advance of the @entity142 in @entity138 , @entity139 the protest on the streets of @entity138 was planned as the week 's biggest demonstration but the turn out was poor compared to the thousands organisers had touted			1
at one point , about two - dozen of the protesters attempted to be disruptive by sitting down and locking arms in front of the headquarters for @entity228			0
they had the phone numbers of lawyers written on their arms			0
but police officers standing nearby took no action			0
the group sat for about 10 minutes before getting up and moving on			0
at least 100 officers in plain uniforms walked along with the parade , carrying gas masks , wooden batons and plastic hand ties			0
a police helicopter hovered so low that people on the ground could feel the wind off its rotors			0
organizers have pledged that the march will be peaceful			0
beefing up security : police officers from all around the country are being brought in to @entity138 ahead of the @entity142 security : hundreds of extra police officers have descended on the @entity139 town aided by the pleasant weather , the protesters showed more spirit than their rain - soaked counterparts at last week 's @entity5 in @entity260			2
there , effects of @entity263 's outer bands thinned the ranks of protesters			2
the @entity138 demonstrators had anti-war signs as well as those promoting unionized labor and the plight of undocumented immigrants			0
one read : ' @entity272 ' with a font and logo that mimicked @entity228			0
another said : ' obama murders children with drones			0
' participants ranged from young girls in cheerleading outfits and parents pushing strollers to occupy @entity137 demonstrators in black shirts and red bandannas			0
campaigning : @entity64 president @entity3 was speaking at a campaign event in @entity27 today supporters : fans of @entity3 came out to show their support in @entity291 the route of the march was also taking demonstrators by a major office hub for @entity296			2
