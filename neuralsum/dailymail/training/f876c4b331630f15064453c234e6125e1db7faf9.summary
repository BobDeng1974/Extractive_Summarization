according to an aide , the 86 - year - old @entity5 @entity6 has suffered from the same sense of deflation many busy people feel when they suddenly stop work			0
his low mood is compounded by failing health , according to @entity14 , the @entity16 gossip blog written by @entity2 observer @entity14			0
@entity3 returned to @entity17 yesterday to take up residence in a former convent in the @entity2 gardens			1

all eyes will be on @entity3 's physical state as he is welcomed by @entity22 at his new retirement home , a converted monastery tucked behind @entity35			1
the last time he was seen by the public - march 23 - @entity3 appeared remarkably more frail and thin than when he left the @entity2 on his final day as pope three weeks earlier			1
the @entity2 spokesman , the rev. @entity45 , has acknowledged @entity3 's post-retirement decline but insists the 86 - year - old @entity47 is n't suffering from any ailment and is just old			1
' he is a man who is not young : he is old and his strength is slowly ebbing , ' @entity45 said this week			0
' however , there is no special illness			0
he is an old man who is healthy			0
' since his febuary 28 resignation , @entity3 has been ' hidden to the world ' as he himself predicted , living at the papal residence in @entity24 , in the hills south of @entity17			1
@entity58 arms : @entity3 emeritus @entity3 , left , is embraced by @entity22 amid reports he is ' depressed ' following his retirement from the @entity2 @entity61 : @entity3 embraces his successor @entity22 as he arrives at the @entity24 summer residence last month @entity3 's new retirement home is a converted monastery tucked behind @entity35			1
the monastery , called @entity26 , is 4,300 square feet and lies just west of @entity35			1
one of the nuns that lived in the monastery told the @entity70 his choice shows his ' great simplicity ' because it ' is not a work of art or comparable with other @entity2 buildings			0
' in the small building , with a chapel attached , @entity3 will live with his personal secretary , monsignor @entity78			2
he will also live with the four consecrated women who look after him , preparing his meals and tending to the household			0
inside the small building , @entity3 has at his disposal a small library and a study			2
a guest room is available for when his brother , monsignor @entity86 , comes to visit			0
according to the @entity88 nun the building had not been refurbished in 18 years and needed minor repairs			0
' we had humidity in the basement , the windows needed changing , and the terrace on top needed fixing and painting because of past snow , ' she explained			0
' but the building is very small , so they had to wait for us to leave to begin working on it			0
' he chose to leave the @entity2 immediately after his resignation to physically remove himself from the process of electing his successor and from @entity3 @entity22 ' first weeks as pontiff			1
his absence also gave workers time to finish up renovations on the monastery on the edge of the @entity2 gardens that until last year housed groups of cloistered nuns who were invited for a few years at a time to live inside the @entity2 to pray for the pontiff and church at large			0
in the small building , with a chapel attached , @entity3 will live with his personal secretary , monsignor @entity78 , and the four consecrated women who look after him , preparing his meals and tending to the household			2
inside the small building , @entity3 has at his disposal a small library and a study			2
a guest room is available for when his brother , monsignor @entity86 , comes to visit			0
' it is certainly small but well - equipped , ' @entity45 said			0
when @entity3 announced his intention to resign - the first pontiff to do so in 600 years - questions immediately swirled about the implications of having two popes living alongside one another inside the @entity2			2
@entity3 fueled those concerns when he chose to be called ' emeritus pope ' and ' @entity136 ' rather than ' emeritus bishop of @entity17			2
' he also raised eyebrows when he chose to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy			0
given the political intrigues that plague the @entity2 , it was n't much of a stretch of the imagination to wonder if some cardinals , bishops and monsignors - not to mention ordinary @entity148 - might continue making @entity3 their point of reference rather than the new pope			2
however , @entity3 made clear on his final day as pope that he was renouncing the job and pledged his ' unconditional reverence and obedience ' to his then - unknown successor			2
it was a pledge he repeated in person on march 23 when @entity22 went to have lunch with him at @entity24			1
it was during that visit that the world saw how frail @entity3 had become in the three weeks since his emotional departure from the @entity164 : always a man with a purposeful walk , he shuffled tentatively that day , using his cane			1
@entity22 , for his part , seems utterly unfazed by the novel situation unfolding			0
hidden : since his febuary 28 resignation , @entity3 has been ' hidden to the world ' as he himself predicted , living at the papal residence in @entity24 , in the hills south of @entity17 , pictured he has frequently invoked @entity3 's name and work and has called him on a half - dozen occasions , making clear he has no intention of ignoring the fact that there 's another pope still very much alive and now living on the other side of the garden from the @entity2 hotel where he lives			1
@entity22 ' gestures to @entity3 during that march 23 visit were also remarkable : he refused to pray on the special papal kneeler in the small chapel of @entity24 , preferring to join @entity3 on a kneeler in the pews , and referring to his predecessor as his ' brother			1
' now that they 're neighbors , they might bump into one another on walks in the @entity2 gardens or at the shrine to the @entity200 on the top of the hill , just a stone 's throw from @entity3 's new home .			1

has been living at the papal residence in @entity24 since resignation
