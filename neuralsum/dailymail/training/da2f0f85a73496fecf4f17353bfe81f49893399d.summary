this is the incredible moment two whale sharks trapped inside a fishing net were set free			1
the amazing images show divers @entity4 and @entity6 helping free the tangled pair - which then swim alongside them to say thanks			2
marine biologist @entity10 captured the release after approaching fisherman off @entity13 , @entity14 , who were preparing for the rescue			1
@entity10 , from @entity27 , said : ' the main conservation challenge there is conflict between fishermen and sharks			1
' the fishers use nets to catch small fish and tuna which feed on the same little shrimps the whale sharks eat			2
the amazing images show divers @entity4 and @entity6 helping free the tangled pair - which then swim alongside them to say thanks the mammoth whale sharks , who swam into the nets , looked like they were being chocked by the fisherman 's net ' they look for schools of fish on the surface and quickly run a net around them			1
' the fish are trapped within the loop and the net is pulled in by hand			0
it 's hard , labour - intensive work with 30 - 50 fishers on each boat			0
' if whale sharks are amongst the fish then they often get enclosed in the net themselves			2
there were two sharks in the net - one 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish - throughout the dive which took place in november photographer @entity10 , from @entity27 , said : ' the main conservation challenge there is conflict between fishermen and sharks ' the fishers use nets to catch small fish and tuna which feed on the same little shrimps the whale sharks eat , ' @entity10 said ' a lot of the sharks have entanglement scars so it 's obvious this can be a problem			1
' once the net had been pulled together the whale sharks approached the surface and @entity4 swam in to check they were okay			2
' the larger shark eventually swam right up to the net so the fishers lowered the floats so he could swim across without tangling			0
@entity10 , 35 , is the principal scientist in charge of the @entity97 for the @entity98 the divers came to the aid of the terrified whale sharks who had become tangled in the gigantic fishing nets two whale sharks became tangled up in this fisherman 's net , which attracts small fish the whale shark feeds on ' the shark gave a couple of big kicks and swam away fine before the second , smaller shark followed			1

he added : ' our project team has started to work with the fishermen and they 're great			0
' they help us to find the sharks and even report in their sighting information when we 're not there			0
' the fishers are n't interested in catching the sharks - they want to let them escape with no fuss so they can keep the fish in the net			0
eventually , the whale sharks were set free and followed the divers to thank them			2
the whole thing was caught on camera by @entity10 the gigantic whale shark was captured in the nets in @entity14			1
the whale shark is a vulnerable species			0
according to @entity10 , there are only 30 pups in the world ' during the day it all worked like the well - practiced operation it is			0
no damage to the net and the sharks escaped without any injury			0
' @entity13 is one of the best places in the world to see whale sharks as individual sharks spend a long time in the area			1
' it allows us to find them consistently			0

two whale sharks required the assistance of two divers when they became trapped in fishermen 's nets
two divers off @entity13 in @entity14 helped to *untangle* the whale sharks
the two whale sharks then swam alongside the divers to thank them in an incredible moment
photographer @entity10 , who is principal the principal scientist for the @entity98 , caught the whole thing on camera
he says the main conservation challenge is between fishermen and sharks and his *research* aims to help in the preservation of whale sharks
