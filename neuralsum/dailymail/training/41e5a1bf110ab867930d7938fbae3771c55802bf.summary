the @entity1 refused to share catering services with mps because they were worried about the quality of champagne , it has been claimed			1
a plan to merge to management of bars and restaurants in both houses of @entity11 was jettisoned after peers expressed fears of being forced to drink cheap bubbly , according to a former commons chief			1
while the @entity18 and @entity3 share it , cleaning and archive services , reaching agreement on champagne purchasing was seen as a step too far			1
the @entity1 refused to merge catering contracts with the @entity22 because they ' feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service ' a group of @entity3 is examining the way the @entity27 is run , following the row over @entity30 's plan to install an @entity32 woman as clerk			1
but one of the biggest differences has emerged over their taste in fine wines			0
former clerk sir @entity38 revealed the tensions between the two houses of @entity11 when the committee took evidence			1
he insisted that ' joint services must be a good idea ' and they already exist in @entity45 and the running of the estate			2
' nevertheless , there are historical differences between the @entity40			0
' he said there had been a long running argument – lasting 20 or even 50 years – about whether the elaborately decorated @entity53 , complete with a crystal chandelier and deep red carpets , belongd to the @entity22			2
sir @entity38 added : ' the person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service , and it was eventually thrown out in the @entity1 because the @entity18 feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service			1
' former labour cabinet minister @entity66 , chairman of the commons governance committee , was taken aback by the claim , asking : ' did you make that up ? is that true ? ' governance committee chairman @entity66 expressed astonishment at the revelation about champagne from former commons clerk sir @entity38 ( right ) @entity18 already share it , cleaning and archive services , but catering was seen as a step too far but sir @entity38 insisted it had happened			1
' yes , it is true , he said			0
' it should not be beyond the wit of man , chair , to brigade the services together and deliver them differently			0
former @entity89 minister @entity88 , who sits on the committee , remarked : ' you can never underestimate the capacity for self - parody in this place			0
' since 2010 the @entity1 has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £ 265,770			1
it is the univalent of five bottles each for every peer			0
the stunned mps returned to the topic later , when @entity105 mp @entity104 wondered whether the @entity18 ' fears about the quality of champagne in the @entity22 was justified , the @entity101 reported			1
' i feel compelled to ask : were they right about the champagne ? ' mr @entity104 said			2
sir @entity38 insisted : ' i do n't think they were ; we were very careful in our selection			1
' the champagne row caused such a storm that @entity3 raised it again at a later hearing of the committee , as they grilled @entity117 , who stood down as clerk of the @entity22 this year after reports of rows with mr @entity30			1
lord @entity117 warned of ' suspicion ' between the two houses over the prospect of joint working			0
' you also need to look at where it will really make a difference			0
' it would be very difficult to get a joint catering service			0
i must be very careful for a number of reasons what i say here			0
' mr @entity104 asked if he was referring to the dispute over champagne , but lord @entity117 refused to get drawn into it			2
' no , i am not going into the quality of the champagne			0
people are very possessive about some services			0
catering is an absolute classic			0
' however , a @entity18 spokesman said : ' @entity1 would not reject a merger of catering services with the @entity27 simply on the supply of champagne			1
' @entity1 catering department and subsidy is significantly smaller than that of the @entity27 , and it is not clear that any merger would produce savings in the costs of the @entity1			2
all alcohol sold in the @entity1 is sold at a profit			2

@entity157 rejected plan to merge contracts over fears about their bubbly
commons and @entity18 already share it , cleaning and archives contracts
but *meddling* with their meals was seen as a step too far for the @entity18
@entity171 sir @entity38 insisted @entity22 *tipples* were up to scratch
but @entity1 insists champagne was not a deal *breaker*
