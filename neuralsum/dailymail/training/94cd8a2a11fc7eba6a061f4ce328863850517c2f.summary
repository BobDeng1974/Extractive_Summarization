two daredevil climbers who 've dedicated their lives to scaling some of the world 's tallest and most iconic buildings without safety harnesses have revealed their latest exploits and shared what drives them and their biggest fears to @entity8			1
@entity9 , 22 , and @entity10 , 25 , climbed to death - defying and dizzying heights to take these vertigo - inducing pictures from the tips of skyscrapers looking down on @entity16 and nearby @entity17 last month			1
having eluded an official ban from @entity19 following their last trip when they filmed themselves scaling the 2,132ft ( 650 metre ) - high , under - construction @entity25 , the world - famous pair returned lured back by the dramatic skylines			1
@entity9 told @entity8 : ' i 'd rather die falling from a great height than fall from a building four stories high and end up alive and crippled			1
that 's the biggest fear '			0
seen here on the @entity43 , @entity16 @entity44 : the team have climbed some of the world 's tallest and most iconic buildings , documenting their conquests as they go			1
seen here at the summit of one of two spirals at the top of the 1,259ft ( 384 - metre ) - tall @entity54 in @entity17 subterfuge : the pair often elude security to gain access to the roofs of buildings which they climb without harnesses to take their stomach - churning pictures like this shot from a spiral on the @entity54 in @entity17 the adrenalin - junkies from @entity69 and @entity70 , who both use pseudonyms , met in @entity74 when they bumped into each other while climbing a suspension bridge			1
the duo have since taken to the rooftops of @entity80 's @entity79 , @entity82 's @entity81 , and the @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity85			1
they have also conquered @entity88 's pyramids and some of @entity90 's newest skyscrapers			0
last february the pair made headlines by scaling the 2,132ft ( 650 metre ) - high , under - construction @entity25 in @entity19 , filming a jaw - dropping video of the climb			1
and when the video went live , the @entity19 authorities said the climbers would be banned from ever returning to the country			2
but their pseudonyms allowed them to slip through the net and for this latest @entity19 trip the pair went to the @entity105 city of @entity17 last month and climbed the 2,165ft ( 660 - metre ) - high , 110 - story @entity107 , which is still under construction			1
' we went upstairs disguised as local workers , ' mr @entity9 told @entity8			1
' we got 610 metres [ 2,001ft ] high then security guards stopped us			1
at first they were very angry and only spoke in @entity19 so we could n't really talk			0
but they recognised us and managed to say , " you 've been on @entity25 ! " they must have seen our previous video			0
' exploits : the duo , who use pseudonyms to avoid identification and travel bans , can now add the iconic @entity122 building in @entity16 as one of their many conquests around the world gulp : they often dress in suits and ties disguised as workers to gain access to the top floors before scaling the outsides of tower blocks dizzying : photos taken from the top of skyscrapers looking down on the streets below are posted on @entity140 to more than 150,000 followers breathtaking : these dazzling pictures were taken from @entity143 in @entity16			1
the area holds the world record for the highest population density , with 340,000 people per square mile mr @entity9 added : ' soon after that we started laughing with them and managed strike up a chat about girls and other stuff and they must have thought , " these are some cool guys "			1
eventually they let us leave and did n't even try to check our passports			0
' the pair also got stunning pictures from the 1,259ft ( 384 - metre ) - high @entity54 building , @entity17 's second tallest skyscraper			1
they then headed to @entity16 - mr @entity9 's favourite climbing destination			1
' we got into the @entity166 but we were unsuccessful in getting on the roof , ' he said			0
standing 1,204ft ( 367 metres ) tall and boasting 72 floors , the tower is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in @entity16			0
on top of the world : @entity9 surveys the view in @entity143 in @entity16 on his 22nd birthday			1
the @entity70 former officer worker has been travelling the world scaling buildings with @entity179 , 25 , since 2013 teetering : a woman dangles her legs dangerously over the streets of @entity16 while the traffic bustles below bright lights : a woman is silhouetted against a backdrop of @entity16 at night as she perches on the corner of a tower block ' we went there dressed in suits and ties and asked for a pass for the 56th floor from reception , ' said mr @entity9			1
' they saw we were well - dressed and just gave us the passes			0
but there were security guards on the roof so we could n't make it all the way up			2
' on their first trip to @entity19 last year they slept 2,132ft ( 650 metres ) up on @entity25 for 12 hours waiting for pollution to clear but had no problems with security			2
' when i woke up on the tower i felt like i was in an aeroplane , behind the clouds , ' mr @entity9 said			2
' and we did n't have one problem with security			2
it was the @entity214 holiday so there was almost nobody there			0
' after the @entity25 video went live the @entity19 government slapped a ban on the climbers which they evaded easily			2
' they said they tried to report us to the @entity70 government but i think it was just something to tell the newspapers , ' mr @entity9 said			1
' i do n't think they really did it			0
when we came in again through customs the other week we had no problems at all			0
we were n't even nervous			0
' look , one hand ! @entity9 and @entity179 's conquests have seen them climb to almost 2 , 300ft ( 701 metres ) on top of some of the world 's highest buildings scale : the 1,259ft ( 384 - metre ) - tall @entity54 skyscraper , left , and the @entity244 , right , which is still under construction , have both been scaled by the fearless climbers mr @entity9 claims that he has never been close to falling or feared for his life during a climb and has no qualms about continuing to travel the world in search of new skyscraper thrills			1
in fact , he says that the higher up he climbs , the less fear he feels			0
' i 'd rather die falling from a great height than fall from a building four stories high and end up alive and crippled			1
that 's the biggest fear , ' he said			0
' every day in @entity260 , maybe six times a day , i feel like i 'm going to die when i 'm driving around on my motorcycle			2
driving in @entity260 is far more dangerous than climbing a skyscraper			0
' mr @entity9 is now taking a break from skyscraper climbing in @entity267 , before heading to @entity268 to prepare for an exhibition of on the @entity271 photography at @entity273 's @entity272			2
this summer the pair hope to travel to @entity275 for more high - octane climbs and to compile a documentary about themselves and other urban explorers around the world			1
oh la la ! mr @entity9 gets a view of the @entity83 that few tourists in @entity85 get from a nearby rooftop			2
the pair try to capture every thrill - seeking moment on camera cool , calm and collected : mr @entity9 chats on his mobile phone while sitting on a ledge of a skyscraper in the @entity291 town of @entity292 in their time climbing buildings around the world they have got into numerous scrapes with local authorities and private security			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the worst one i had was in @entity302			2
police caught us and wanted to put us in jail for six months for trespassing			0
we did n’t go on the roof top , we just went on the highest stairs			0
' the police caught us and after that told us the car was coming to take us to jail , where we ’d be for maybe three or six months			0
and they said " you will pay a very big penalty "			0
but security helped us – they said we were nice people and maybe we could make a deal			2
then the police just gave us a penalty of $ 25			0
' he added : ' maybe we ’re very lucky			0
i know a lot of cases where people climb on bridges or roof tops and end up in jail - especially people who climb on construction buildings in @entity332			2
even if security or police do n't catch them on a construction building or bridge , after they post in @entity140 or @entity340 they track them down			1
they come round your house in a few months and put you in jail			0
@entity332 is the most strict place in the world for any exploration			0
that ’s why we have n't done it yet			0
