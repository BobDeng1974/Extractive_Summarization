he said the league needs a ' wake up call ' as it was ' behind the curve ' reacting to the footage of @entity11 punching his then - fiancee , now wife , unconscious			1
and if there is going to be a change in attitude , he said , it needs to start in college football where ' blind spots are rooted ' and ' certain behaviors have been tolerated '			1
