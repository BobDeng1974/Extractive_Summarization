@entity2 bt @entity0 @entity9 struggled to get out of second gear but eventually found his stride to stop @entity7 and stay on track for another tilt at a world title			1
the @entity31 , who lost twice to @entity32 in the last 12 months , barely gave himself pass marks for what was a below - par performance			0
@entity9 is the mandatory challenger for @entity37 's @entity36 belt , a fight for which negotiations are expected to start next week			1
@entity7 , who is rather uniquely trained by his mum @entity42 , had won his previous three fights and also has one scheduled for next month			2
but he hit the canvas hard in as fight approached the halfway point when @entity9 landed successive right hooks to the head			2
@entity7 managed to beat the count but was stopped moments later when the referee stepped in following another barrage of shots on the ropes			0
@entity7 enjoyed a strong second round as he outlanded @entity9 who left himself far more open than was necessary			1
but , gradually , @entity9 stamped his authority on the fight , finding his range and slipping some rather wild shots			0
and he landed the decisive blows in the seventh session to set himself up for bigger challenges to come			0
@entity9 celebrates after the referee stops the fight in the seventh round @entity9 poses with his silver super-middleweight title ( left ) and remains on course for a world title shot @entity9 said : ' @entity83 [ @entity84 , his trainer ] gave me five out of 10 and i 'll need to watch it back but i 'd probably agree			1
' it was what i needed , he 's a good fighter			0
it 's good to get another stoppage and be back knocking people out			0
' there are other options but i want the quickest route [ to a world title ] and that is the @entity36			1
