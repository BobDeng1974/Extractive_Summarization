by @entity0 for @entity1 treasurer @entity2 used his own wealthy electorate of @entity4 as an example as to why it was important to introduce a $ 7 co-payment for visits to the doctor			1
after the @entity10 in may , mr @entity2 said : ' i want to emphasise my electorate of @entity4 has one of the highest bulk - billing rates in @entity15 and i have one of the wealthiest electorates in @entity15 '			1
' to me there is something wrong with that			0
' but it turns out mr @entity2 's figures were way off the mark			2
his wealthy electorate on @entity4 's @entity25 is actually in the bottom 20 per cent of bulk - billers , which is the term used to describe visits to the doctor or hospital paid for by the taxpayer - funded @entity31			1
new figures supplied to a @entity39 from the @entity40 suggest it 's quite the opposite the latest @entity40 figures available ( from 2013 ) show that bulk - billing rates in mr @entity2 's electorate are 126th out of 150			1
this same information was provided to a @entity45 on bulk - billing rates around the country			2
bulk - billed : the table ( above ) shows that mr @entity2 's electorate is actually 126th out of 150 electorates , not as the treasurer claimed ' one of the highest bulk - billing rates in @entity15 ' as the table shows , the areas with a high percentage of bulk - billing are in the lower socio - economic areas of @entity4 's western and south - western suburbs			1
most of those electorates are @entity62 - held seats			2
just one , @entity63 in outer western @entity4 , is held by the @entity64			0
mr @entity2 's @entity4 electorate ranks 126 out of 150			1
@entity62 's shadow minister for health , @entity66 said : ' @entity2 is completely out of touch on the health needs of @entity15 '			2
shadow health minister @entity66 says ' the @entity69 hits everyone but it particularly hits low and middle income earners and those with poor health and they tend to live in some of our poorer suburbs ' ' contrary to the treasurer ’s claim , his electorate does not have one of the highest bulk - billing rates in @entity15 , it has one of the lowest , ' ms @entity66 said			1
' the @entity69 hits everyone but it particularly hits low and middle income earners and those with poor health and they tend to live in some of our poorer suburbs , mostly in the outer suburbs and regional and rural communities			0
the very people @entity2 thinks also wo n’t pay his petrol tax because they do n’t drive			2
' ' scrapping bulk - billing and hitting low and middle income @entity15 , poor , pensioners , children and the chronically ill. ' in @entity99 's area of @entity100 in western @entity4 , 99 per cent of doctors ' visits were bulk - billed			1
the figures show of 1,457,609 patient visits , 1,444,598 were not charged			0
the next four areas are all @entity62 - held seats in @entity105 , where just about every visit to the @entity107 was paid for by bulk - billing			2
this in contrast to mr @entity2 's electorate , where only 72 per cent of gp visits were bulk - billed			1
ms @entity66 said that the @entity112 told a recent @entity113 of @entity115 expenses inquiry ‘ there is good evidence to suggest that there is a negative economic impact with patients using more expensive health care through the hospital system that could be delivered by general practice at a fraction of the cost ’			0
health minister @entity126 has fired another salvo at senators planning to block the bill , suggesting it will lead to a smaller @entity131			0
health minister @entity126 is warning any scrapping of the co-payment will damage the plans for a $ 20 billion @entity135 @entity31 was established in 1984 replacing the old @entity137 system , which had its beginnings in 1975 under the @entity139 ' the medical research future fund without the co-payment will be much smaller , no doubt about that , ' he said			0
the government claims that $ 5 of the $ 7 co-payment will be put towards the establishing of a $ 20 billion fund			0
' if the co-payment falls over , then that is going to be a big blow to the medical research fund			0
' the treasurer , though , is coming under fire from all angles , including internally			0
after being cut loose by senior cabinet ministers , including the pm , over his ' poor people do n't drive ' claim , there are revelations today that he also had to be pulled into line by the prime minister and foreign minister @entity162 in a party room meeting			1
the altercation stemming from a verbal assault @entity2 reportedly launched against @entity166 premier @entity166 over gst revenue .			0

treasurer @entity2 said ' my electorate of @entity4 has one of the highest bulk - billing rates in @entity15 and i have one of the wealthiest electorates in @entity15 '
it actually ranks only 126 out of 150 electorates for bulk - billing
the majority of areas with the highest percentage of bulk - billing are @entity62 *strongholds* in in @entity4 's west and south - western suburbs
the treasurer *copped* flak for his comment ' poor people do n't drive cars ' in defending the petrol tax plan in his @entity193
mr @entity2 's position in @entity196 has come under question after a fierce party room *stoush* with @entity200 *colleagues*
reports by *mps* who *watched* his ' *extraordinary* ' *outburst* in the meeting suggest mr @entity2 had to be ' *slapped* down ' by the pm
