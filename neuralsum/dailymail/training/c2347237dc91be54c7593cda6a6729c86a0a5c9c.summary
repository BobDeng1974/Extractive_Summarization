by @entity0 last updated at 10:47 pm on 11th january 2012 @entity1 taunted the @entity2 for delaying an independence vote by telling mps today that ‘ it is not a referendum they want , it 's a never - endum ’			1
the prime minister ratcheted up the war of words with @entity11 by suggesting his party are avoiding a real debate about @entity14 leaving the @entity15 because they are worried about losing it			1
polls suggest that less than a third of voters north of the border would back ending the 300 - year union if a referendum was held now			2
the @entity2 leader wants the vote to be held in 2014			2
war of words : @entity1 challenged @entity11 ( right ) to a real debate but said the @entity2 ' do n't want to talk about the substance ' of deciding whether @entity14 leaves the 300 - year - old union with @entity30 mr @entity1 , who has suggested that a vote may only be considered legally binding by the @entity32 if it is held within 18 months , said : ‘ let 's have the debate and let 's keep our country together			1
’ he told the @entity38 during prime minister ’s questions : ‘ i passionately believe in the future of our @entity15			0
‘ i passionately believe we are stronger together rather than breaking apart			0
‘ frankly , i am sad we are even having this debate , because i support the @entity15 so strongly , but we have to respect the fact that @entity14 voted for a separatist party at the @entity14 parliamentary elections			2
more than half of @entity14 voters want to remain in the @entity15 , according to a poll released today			1
some 54 per cent of people in @entity14 questioned by @entity50 for the thinktank @entity15 future said they wanted to stay in the @entity52 - compared to just 29 per cent who backed independence			1
the poll , released as the government set out its position on the terms of any referendum on independence , also showed similar majorities in both @entity30 and @entity62 in favour of @entity14 staying in the @entity15			2
according to the survey , voters north of the border are slightly more enthusiastic about preserving the @entity52 than people in @entity30 or @entity62			2
some 48 per cent of those questioned in @entity30 backed the @entity52 , against 27 per cent who supported independence for @entity62 , 41 per cent wanted @entity14 to stay in the @entity15 , while 29 per cent said it should become independent			1
support for the @entity52 was stronger among older people , with six out of 10 over- 55s wanting @entity14 to stay in the @entity15 , compared to four out of 10 of those aged 16 - 44			1
@entity74 for @entity14 was more popular among men ( 32 per cent ) than women ( 23 per cent )			2
and middle - class professionals were more likely to want to keep the @entity52 ( 53 per cent ) than those in lower skilled posts ( 46 per cent ) or unskilled jobs ( 44 per cent )			0
@entity50 interviewed 2,320 people across @entity82 between november 30 and december 6 , including 497 in @entity14			0
‘ the first thing that is right to do is to make clear the legal position about a referendum , and that is what the @entity86 ( @entity87 ) has been doing			0
‘ we have made the offer that we will devolve the power to hold that referendum , so a referendum can be made in @entity14 and held in @entity14			0
‘ frankly , i look forward to having the debate because i think there have been too many in the @entity2 who are happy to talk about the process , but they do n't want to talk about the substance			1
‘ i sometimes think when i listen to them that it is not a referendum they want , it 's a never - endum			0
’ the prime minister was backed by @entity108 leader @entity107 as the two main @entity110 parties joined together in pledging to fight for @entity14 to remain part of the @entity15			1
mr @entity107 called on supporters of the @entity52 to make a positive case for its continuation			1
he warned the @entity115 : ‘ this is a momentous decision which our children and grandchildren will have to live with if we get it wrong			0
’ mr @entity107 called for immediate cross-party talks to deal with the process of how a single - question referendum can be held under the oversight of the @entity125			2
but he said it was vital that @entity128 politicians move quickly on to debating the substance of the issues surrounding independence for @entity14			1
‘ we on this side of the @entity38 believe the @entity15 benefits the people of @entity14 and the people of the rest of the @entity15 in equal measure , ’ said the @entity108 leader			2
‘ we are stronger together and weaker apart			0
‘ we must make the case for the @entity52 - not simply against separatism , but the positive case about the shared benefits to us all of @entity14 's part in the @entity15 , the shared economic interests , the shared institutions like the @entity146 , our defence forces and the @entity148 and above all the shared values we hold together			1
’ mr @entity107 added : ‘ we need a serious , thoughtful and inclusive debate on what the choices are and the benefits to @entity14 of staying in the @entity15			1
‘ on this one issue , the people of our country deserve nothing less than that serious debate about the benefits of the @entity15			0
’ mr @entity1 responded that he was in ‘ 100 per cent agreement ’ with his opponent			0
the display of unity came a day after mr @entity11 told @entity110 politicians to ‘ butt out ’ of the debate over the timing and format of the referendum			0
@entity14 's nationalist government reacted with fury yesterday to the prime minister 's attempts to wrestle control back from first minister @entity11 ( pictured right ) he also said the referendum would be held in @entity177 2014 - a date that appears to have been selected so it falls just a few weeks after the 700th anniversary of the @entity180 , @entity14 ’s most famous military victory over @entity30 , and when mr @entity11 hopes resentment over government spending cuts will be at its height			2
mr @entity11 said he was ‘ staggered ’ that @entity110 was seeking to close down the possibility of a third option in a referendum			0
support : @entity107 backed the prime minister over @entity14 in a show of unity between the two main @entity110 parties he believes @entity14 voters may be more likely to back so - called ‘ devo max ’ – an extended version of devolution that would see fiscal autonomy for @entity14 but see it remain in the @entity15 – than full independence			1
his outburst followed the @entity15 @entity32 's publication yesterday of a paper which argued that the @entity201 has no power to call a poll			0
the consultation paper proposed that the @entity205 could make an order to devolve power to @entity201 to stage a ballot on the single question of independence , which could take place within the next 18 months			0
but @entity2 mp @entity212 today accused mr @entity1 of following in the footsteps of @entity214 by seeking to dictate to @entity14			1
‘ the @entity216 was elected with an overwhelming mandate to deliver an independence referendum in the second half of the parliamentary term , ’ mr @entity212 told @entity215			0
‘ in contrast the @entity221 has less members of @entity201 ( in @entity14 ) than there are giant pandas in @entity226			1
‘ so why is the prime minister trying to emulate @entity214 by dictating to @entity14 ? ’ mr @entity1 said it was ‘ quite the opposite ’ as the government was offering @entity14 the power to hold a legal referendum			0
he added : ‘ right across this @entity38 there is uniform belief that that needs to happen			0
’ @entity108 ’s @entity234 of 1998 , which established devolution , and was supposed to close down the question of @entity14 independence , states explicitly that the question of ‘ the @entity52 of @entity14 and @entity30 ’ will remain a matter reserved to @entity110 .			1

@entity227 says @entity2 more interested in talking about ' process ' than ' substance '
@entity2 hit back with jibe : there are more pandas in @entity14 than @entity221 mps
@entity107 backs pm and calls for serious debate about ' benefits ' of @entity52
polls show that only 29 *%* of @entity14 voters would back independence now
