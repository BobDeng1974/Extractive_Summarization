by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 4 july 2013 former @entity2 president @entity1 views his successor @entity3 as a ‘ ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair ’ , it emerged today			1
the vicious attack is reported by @entity8 , the highly respected @entity9 news magazine whose editor is a close friend of mr @entity1 ’s third wife , @entity12			1
barely disguised hatred between the two politicians has been well documented , but this is the first time that mr @entity1 ’s bitter language has been reported in public			1
mutual dislike : @entity1 , pictured left , has described his successor @entity3 , pictured right , as a ' ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair ' according to the magazine , mr @entity1 told a friend : ‘ you ’ve seen him , this ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair			1
do you know men who dye their hair ? ’ mr @entity1 , a 58 - year - old conservative , was roundly beaten by the portly socialist , who is also 58 , in last year ’s presidential election			1
when mr @entity1 was head of state ms @entity12 put him on a fitness programme aimed at making him leaner , fitter and younger looking			0
before that mr @entity1 , who is only 5ft 5ins , was himself mocked for being a chubby little man			0
he continued to wear platform heels , and to surround himself with smaller men in an attempt to look taller , but lost a great deal of weight through constant work - outs and giving up chocolate			0
mr @entity3 , in contrast , has failed to lose the tubby image which has seen him nick - named @entity42 , after a custard pudding popular in @entity2			2
handover of power : @entity1 and @entity12 leave the @entity46 after @entity3 , pictured in the background with his partner @entity48 , was sworn in as president mr @entity3 has also made an effort to lose some pounds , and his hair has got noticeably darker over the last few months			1
like mr @entity1 , he has a younger partner – his girlfriend is 48 - year - old divorcee @entity48 – and is only too well aware of how important it is to maintain a dynamic image			2
mr @entity1 infamously collapsed while out jogging during his presidency , and only managed one term in office			0
he was widely disliked by millions of voters , and within a few days of losing his presidential immunity from prosecution saw the house he shares with ms @entity12 raided by anti-corruption police			0
mr @entity3 is fairing equally badly as his tax - and - spend policies create economic disaster for @entity2			0
opinion polls already reveal that mr @entity3 is the most unpopular president in the history of the @entity68 , with mr @entity1 a close second .			2

@entity1 was beaten by @entity3 in last year ’s election
their mutual dislike is well - known but this is the first time @entity1 *'s* bitter language has been reported in public
