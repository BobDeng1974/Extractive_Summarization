five days on , the identity of the guardian angel priest of @entity3 's @entity2 remains as mysterious as his appearance on the roadside was miraculous			1
friends and family of @entity8 , along with rescue workers still want to thank the unidentified man whose prayers they credit with bestowing a supernatural calm as @entity13 's battled to cut the @entity15 teen from her mangled car wreck			1
but with no one coming forward to claim credit , and over 70 photographs of the crash scene yielding no images of the priest , some have suggested that the divine intervention of one of the @entity27 's most beloved modern figures could have been at work			1
indeed , @entity29 , the mother of @entity8 said that her daughter 's car was so twisted that rescuers said no one should have been able to survive			1
' i do believe he certainly could have been an angel dressed in priest 's attire because the @entity38 tells us there are angels among us			2
' scroll down for @entity42 @entity43 ? many had speculated online that @entity45 who was said to be blessed with many supernatural powers during his life time was the priest who helped @entity8 on @entity48 on sunday some have speculated online that the priest could have been the @entity51 , who died in @entity53 45 years ago			1
he has a huge global following , with celebrities such @entity56 and the @entity53 @entity57 devoted to the humble man from @entity59			0
@entity45 was said to have suffered the stigmata - the wounds of @entity62 on the cross - throughout his adult life and those who knew him said that he exuded a blissful smell of violets , had persuasive powers of conversion and could heal the sick			1
however , most remarkable of all , it is believed that @entity45 had the gift of ' bilocation ' - the ability to be in two places at once			1
mangled wreck : emergency workers were struggling to save @entity8 when she was hit head - on by a drunk driver on @entity48 near to @entity79 , @entity3 effort : the desperate effort to save @entity8 was blessed by the catholic priest who appeared from nowhere and just as mysteriously vanished indeed , the man who appeared at the crash site was said by those who saw him to have an olive complexion , facial hair , a foreign accent and carried an old wooden rosary - which he prayed with while the emergency workers battled to free @entity8			1
it is his seemingly miraculous powers that have led some of his followers to believe that the man who blessed @entity8 and her rescuers was indeed , @entity45			1
@entity45 's real name was @entity45 and he was born in 1887 to peasant farmers living near @entity99 on @entity53 's east coast			1
a poor scholar , he entered a @entity103 monastery as a novice at the age of 15 , already suffering from ill - health aggravated by self - imposed penances			2
by the age of 23 , he was diagnosed with tuberculosis , only for the disease miraculously to leave him			0
but it was when the bleeding stigmata appeared overnight on @entity45 's body that he became a true ' celebrity '			1
@entity115 and @entity116 : a sketch was created from the recollections of those who were at the scene of the crash on sunday to help jog peoples memories - while ( right ) @entity123 has been suggested as the identity of the mystery priest on october 22 , 1918 , he wrote to his spiritual adviser , describing how this happened to him			1
' on the morning of the 20th of last month , in the choir , after i had celebrated @entity130 , i yielded to a drowsiness similar to a sweet sleep			0
i was suddenly filled with great peace and abandonment which effaced everything else and caused a lull in the turmoil			0
all this happened in a flash			0
' while this was taking place , i saw before me a mysterious person ...			0
his hands and feet and side were dripping blood			0
the sight terrified me and what i felt at that moment is indescribable			0
' i thought i should die and really should have died if the @entity151 had not intervened and strengthened my heart , which was about to burst out of my chest			0
' the vision disappeared and i became aware that my hands , feet and side were dripping blood			0
imagine the agony i experienced and continue to experience almost every day			0
" @entity45 's wounds continued to bleed till the end of his life , the liquid exuding a sweet smell akin to violets			1
the cuts refused to heal and he lost as much as a cup of blood a day			0
while a spokesman for the @entity170 attempts to find the identity of the priest - some parishioners have suggest that @entity173 is the man while the world waits to see if indeed the guardian angel of @entity48 is revealed , a @entity175 - based artist who works for a facial recognition software firm has created a sketch which he hopes will lead to the mans identification			1
@entity181 explained in an e-mail to @entity183 4 that he based the sketch on mostly on media reports			0
he also said he has a brother - in - law who is a priest and he just had a sense based on his experiences and the reports of what the unidentified priest may look like			1
it was on sunday that @entity8 , a sophomore at @entity193 , was driving from her parents ' @entity194 , @entity15 home to @entity196 , @entity3 , where she has a summer internship			1
her @entity198 was hit head - on by another vehicle , driven by a drunk driver and the accident crushed @entity8 's car in a mangled wreck that left her with multiple broken bones , a ruptured spleen and damaged liver			1
workers from across the county battled for over an hour and a half to extricate @entity8 from her car - but she was fading fast and their equipment was not heavy duty enough			1
it was then that she asked to pray and at that moment the priest appeared to offer his blessings to @entity8 and the emergency workers			1
divine intervention : @entity8 was saved after emergency workers from @entity221 fire services arrived with heavy duty cutting equipment the silver haired priest was reportedly in his 50s or 60s and was wearing black pants , a black shirt and black collar and seemingly stepped forward to answer @entity8 's plea from nowhere			1
@entity232 , the @entity233 fire chief said that it struck him as odd from the start as @entity48 was blocked off for two miles in each direction and no one from the close - knit community recognized the man			2
' we 're all local people from four different towns , " @entity232 said			0
" we 've only got one catholic church out of three towns and it was n't their priest			2
' immediately after the 6ft tall priest gave his blessing , the emergency workers righted the car , stabilized @entity8 's vital signs and cut her out once the jaws of life appeared from a neighboring town			1
she was put in an air ambulance and is now recovering in hospital			2
but when they turned to thank the priest , he was gone			1
some have pointed out that sunday just happened to be the feast of @entity261 , the patron saint of priests			0
others have said that the mystery priest could be be father @entity265 - the patron saint of immigrants			1
he was killed in @entity268 's @entity267 but his ghost is said to haunt highways as far north as @entity15 , giving people in need water , food and even helping them with directions if they are lost			2
others have pointed to the more plausible guess that the priest who stopped to help is from a neighboring town			2
scene : dozens of emergency workers battled to free @entity8 as she lay pinned in her @entity198 wreck on @entity48 saved : chief @entity232 said that the catholic priest , now identified as @entity284 , made everyone including @entity8 calmer before the jaw - of - life appeared from @entity221 some have suggested that @entity173 , the pastor of @entity288 's @entity27 of @entity289 , @entity3 could be the mystery priest			1
on the church website , @entity290 posted a link to a news story of the mysterious priest , stating , ' @entity296 ' intervention of a higher power			2
the @entity298 works through all of us			0
however , a spokesperson for the @entity301 of @entity196 said that they had ruled @entity290 out , because he was saying mass at the time of the crash			0
' i think it 's a miracle , ' said @entity233 fire chief @entity232 to @entity308			0
' i would say whether it was an angel that was sent to us in the form of a priest or a priest that became our angel , i do n't know			2
either way , i 'm good with it			0
' the @entity319 page of @entity8 's mother , @entity320 , indicates @entity8 is on the mend despite suffering two broken femurs , a broken tibia and fibia , broken left wrist , nine broken ribs , a lacerated liver , ruptured spleen and bruised lung			2
empty stretch : the road was closed for a quarter of a mile either side of the crash and there were no bystanders father @entity336 , a @entity337 priest and author of my life with the @entity116 , has a different theory			2
' most likely the priest will be identified , and people will be able to thank him , ' he told @entity344 in an emailed message thursday			2
' if he 's not found , that may mean he wants to remain anonymous			0
could it have been an angel ? there are similar ' angelic ' stories in the lives of the saints , when a figure inexplicably appears and can not be located afterwards			0
' there are angels , of course , but we tend to ascribe to angels anonymous acts that we find incredibly loving -- when in fact human beings do incredibly loving things in hidden ways every day			0
' a spokesman for the @entity301 of @entity196 said officials are trying to get to the bottom of the mystery			0
' we do have several churches and parishes in the area , ' diocese spokesman @entity368 said			0
' we saw the description information and we have pictures on file of all of our priests , but we have n't heard directly from any of them			0

@entity15 student @entity8 , 19 , had been pinned inside her *mercedes* for over an hour and was fading fast when she asked her rescuers to pray
a priest appeared and began to offer up a blessing - after which emergency workers delivered @entity8 from the wreck to hospital
when they turned to thank the priest he had vanished
he has still not been identified five days on and many @entity27 are speculating the priest could have been none other than @entity45
