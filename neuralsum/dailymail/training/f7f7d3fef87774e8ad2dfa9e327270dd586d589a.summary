by @entity0 an eight - year - old â € ˜ child brideâ € ™ reported to have died of internal injuries on her wedding night is alive , it is claimed			1
shocking reports emerged last week of a @entity7 girl called @entity8 who died after being forced into marrying a man five times her age			1
the case sparked international outcry and enraged activists launched a campaign calling for the groom and the girl 's family to be arrested			1
they said the @entity7 government must ban child marriages			2
however , the original report has been called into question after authorities in north western @entity7 presented a girl to reporters that they said was @entity25 , alongside a man claiming to be her father			1
on camera he insisted angrily that only one of his six daughters is married , and it is not @entity8			1
' they are all in good health and not suffering from anything and i deny this news			2
' standing beside him in pink , the little girl giggles for the camera as she too denies the claims			1
asked if she is married , she says : ' no , it is not true			2
' the interviewer asks : ' what would you like to say to the people who said that you were dead ? ' ' i would say to them that this is not true , ' she retorts			1
news of the alleged death broke on september 9 , went viral and prompted outrage around the world			0
human rights groups branded it a landmark case , and said arrests would help put a stop to the practice of marrying very young girls to older men in the impoverished region			2
one blogger , @entity83 , posted that the man was ' an animal who deserved to be punished severely for his crime			1
' all those who supported such a crime should also be punished			0
' another blogger , @entity90 , wrote : ' @entity92 € ™ s family members are not humans			0
they do not deserve to have children			0
' the @entity96 foreign policy chief , @entity95 , said last week she was ' appalled ' by the case and pressed the @entity7 government to investigate			0
in the video , the interviewer asks mr @entity42 : ' it is said that you married off your eight - year - old daughter who bled and died ? ' angry : a man identified as @entity25 's father tells the camera people ' were duped by @entity48 ' to spread rumours innocent ? : mr @entity42 explains that he has one son and seven daughters			1
one is married , not @entity8 ' this is untrue and baseless , ' he replies			1
' it is not true			0
the people who spread this rumour are no good			2
' asked what he has to say to his accusers , mr @entity42 says : ' there are people who like me and there are those who hate me '			0

' the girl is said to have died in the tribal area of @entity154 in northwestern @entity7 , which borders @entity155			1
the practice of marrying young girls is widespread in @entity7 and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages			2
but the horrifying reports about @entity25 prompted at least one government minister to vow that the minimum age for marriage would be raised to 18			1
@entity7 's poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice of child marriage , as poor families find themselves unable to say no to ' bride - prices ' for their daughters that can be worth hundreds of dollars			2
more than a quarter of @entity7 's females marry before age 15 , according to a report in 2010 by the @entity178			0
tribal custom also plays a role , including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient wife , bear more children and be kept away from temptation			2
in september 2010 , a 12 - year - old @entity7 child - bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth , a local human rights organisation said			1
@entity7 once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage , but parliament annulled that law in the 1990s , saying parents should decide when a daughter marries			2
growing crisis : a 40 - year - old bridegroom and his 11 - year - old bride during their wedding in @entity200 , @entity201			1
many countries have no lower age limit for marriage following reports of the @entity8 case , the @entity96 's foreign policy chief , baroness @entity95 , called on the @entity7 government to investigate and make arrests			1

at this rate , the figure is expected to rise to 140 million by 2020			0
