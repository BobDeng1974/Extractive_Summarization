four @entity1 car adverts have been banned for glorifying high speeds and ‘ encouraging dangerous driving ’			1
advertising watchdogs were unhappy that @entity1 ’s ‘ irresponsible ’ focus on the speed and acceleration of their cars was emphasised by the sound of engines being revved and high tempo music			1
but the rap could prove a blessing in disguise for the @entity16 sports and luxury car firm whose latest slogan is : ‘ it ’s good to be bad			0
another scene showed a car driving on open land at high speed , while voice - overs said : ‘ the adaptive dynamics technology reacts 20 times faster than the human eye			1
‘ it delivers a smooth drive by continuously analysing speed , steering and body movement of the car 500 times a second , giving every journey an instinctive , stable and agile ride			2
’ the adverts ended with the @entity1 logo alongside text reading : ‘ @entity1			1
how alive are you ? ’ to the sound of an engine revving			1
one viewer complained that the ads were irresponsible because they ‘ glorified speed and encouraged dangerous driving ’			2
advertising watchdogs agreed and ordered the videos be withdrawn			0
but the ban could ironically be a boost to the car firm which has built a whole campaign around the strapline ‘ it ’s good to be bad ’ and hired big - screen a-listers sir @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity75 to act as its ‘ villainous ’ ambassadors			2
blessing in disguise ? the ban could ironically be a boost to the car firm which has built a whole campaign around the strapline ' it 's good to be bad ' velocity : a car was shown driving at speed through a tunnel in @entity35 and crossing over the single white lines in the middle of a road , before driving across a mountain road at night in one @entity94 - like movie advert for the @entity95 - which has not been banned - sir @entity72 intones : ’ have you ever wondered why in movies , all the villains are played by @entity99 ? ’ @entity1 also has @entity100 as its brand ambassador in @entity103			1
' because we considered that speed was the main message of the ads and the ads portrayed the cars being driven in a dangerous manner , we concluded the ads were irresponsible and condoned dangerous driving ' @entity113 the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) said the overall impression of the four banned adverts was a focus on the speed and acceleration of the cars , emphasised by the sound of engines being revved , high tempo music and the use of blurred lines			1
it noted that the cars were driving on what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be ‘ irresponsible and illegal ’ on a public road in the @entity16			0
the @entity113 said : ‘ we considered that the cars were being handled in a dangerous manner that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly			0
‘ the @entity113 acknowledged that @entity1 had amended the ads to include an on - screen caption , which stated that the ads were filmed on closed roads with a professional driver and advising that viewers always obeyed local speed limits			1
criticism : the @entity113 noted that the cars were driving on what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be ' irresponsible and illegal ' on a public road in the @entity16 luxury car manufacturer : the adverts ended with the @entity1 logo alongside text reading : ' @entity1			1
how alive are you ? ' to the sound of an engine revving ‘ however , we did not consider that this amendment went far enough to resolve the points of complaint			1
‘ because we considered that speed was the main message of the ads and the ads portrayed the cars being driven in a dangerous manner , we concluded the ads were irresponsible and condoned dangerous driving			2
’ it ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form and told @entity1 ‘ not to portray speed as the focus of an ad in future ... and not to portray driving behaviour that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly in future ’			1
@entity1 said the footage of the cars on the open highway was filmed in @entity35 on closed sections of road on the @entity179 and the @entity180 , but a caption making this clear was mistakenly omitted			1
the company said the ads ' emphasis was the technical features and abilities of the cars , and the shots of the cars crossing lanes on the closed road were specifically to highlight the lightweight construction for cornering stability and safety			0
it said the ads ‘ at no time demonstrated any dangerous driving ’ and there was no indication that speed limits were broken			2
@entity1 has unleashed its fastest and most powerful road - legal production car ever with a top speed of 186mph and a £ 140,000 price - tag to match			1
the exclusive super-fast two - seater f - type ‘ @entity212 ’ will accelerate from rest to 60mph in just 3.8 seconds and is to make its fitting public debut at the opening of the four - day @entity210 in @entity211 tomorrow			0
however , perhaps in keeping with @entity1 ’s ‘ bad boy ’ marketing strategy , its launch also coincides with the stern rap from advertising watchdogs who criticised the manufacturer for glorifying speed			2
