@entity0 , while a coach at @entity2 , once visited the home of @entity5 ’s grandfather , @entity6 , a director of the club			1
@entity5 , a 14 - year - old centre - back for @entity2 ’s youth team , was ushered forward to be introduced to the manager of the senior squad			2
@entity13 sized him up , and pushed him to the ground			2
looking down at @entity16 , the @entity15 said : ‘ you are not tough enough to be a centre back			2
’ what @entity13 would n’t give to have @entity5 at @entity19 these days			1
@entity0 ( right ) pictured during his time as @entity2 manager with @entity22 in 1997 @entity5 ( right ) played for @entity19 for four years before leaving for @entity2 in 2008 @entity13 could do with @entity5 these days as the @entity2 defender is pictured hugging @entity24 dec 20 : @entity25 ( away ) dec 26 : @entity26 ( home ) dec 28 : @entity28 ( away ) jan 1 : @entity29 ( away ) jan 11 : @entity30 ( home ) jan 17 : @entity32 ( away ) jan 31 : @entity33 ( home ) that display of tough love from a disciplinarian probably serves as an amusing anecdote around the dinner table for 6ft 4in @entity5			1
he spent four years at @entity41 from the age of 17 before returning to @entity2 in 2008 , where he has won four @entity45 titles and two @entity47 trophies			1
defence is but one of the reasons @entity13 is not quite challenging for the @entity52 title against @entity22 and @entity53			1
six consecutive wins , eight points shy of @entity57 , five of @entity58 , winnable games to come			1
but , as they occasionally ride their luck , they should simply concentrate on the top four , and go from there			1
@entity13 has had four months to warm to his @entity41 hot seat and here , @entity65 delves into the numbers to assess whether they really measure up to the title favourites			2
@entity13 has had four months to warm to his @entity41 hot seat since arriving from 2014 @entity68 goalkeeper @entity70 gave one of those smiles , where you 've got to laugh or you 'll cry			2
once the final whistle went , the grin was gone , the @entity78 striker 's drought continued , and it was all down to the @entity19 goalkeeper			1
the debate at the pub afterwards was whether @entity82 is the heir to @entity83 and @entity85 's throne , or whether he is currently the best in the @entity52			1
in terms of goalkeepers with a minimum of 10 saves in the penalty area , he is			2
@entity92 's 71.74 per cent save ratio is a smidgen better than @entity96 's @entity95 and @entity25 's @entity97			1
@entity70 ( right ) smiles at @entity19 goalkeeper @entity82 ( left ) as he was denied a goal percentage of stops from goalkeepers in the penalty area ( minimum of 10 saves ) 71.74 % - @entity82 71.43 % - @entity95 69.81 % - @entity97 65.85 % - @entity104 64.71 % - @entity105 most stops made by goalkeepers in the last six @entity52 matches ( since november 8 ) 21 - @entity82 19 - @entity97 19 - @entity95 18 - @entity109 17 - @entity110 @entity92 did not allow @entity78 to score and has been in fine form during their last six consecutive wins but better than @entity105 ? @entity113 ? @entity114 ? @entity115 ? @entity92 makes more saves per game than the rest but that tells more about a bandaged - up defence allowing shots through			1
he averages 2.44 , far more than the other four candidates			2
yet the rest of the numbers swing @entity105 's way : in clean sheets ( 0.40 to 0.31 ) , goals conceded ( 0.80 to 1.06 ) and saves per goal ( 2.80 to 2.29 )			1
but the last six games are when they have looked more like @entity19 circa the sir @entity131 era			1
since november 8 , @entity92 has made more saves ( 21 ) than any other goalkeeper in the @entity52			1
he looks nothing like the man that let four in against @entity137 on august 26 , and has been instrumental in keeping three clean sheets in the last six - as many as @entity105 and @entity113			2
you can only ride your luck so far , and the reliance on @entity92 is evident			1
@entity92 ( far left ) averages more saves per game but the numbers swing @entity58 's @entity105 's way @entity92 is being depended upon more and more by @entity13 as @entity19 aim for a top - four finish @entity92 denies @entity78 's @entity150 during @entity19 's 3 - 0 win at @entity41 on sunday @entity92 stops @entity70 from nabbing his first @entity52 goal of the season since signing for @entity78 defence quite often , it 's held together by duck tape or , more recently , @entity157			1
@entity19 have had 48 injuries since @entity13 's first press conference on july 16 - 18 of which were to defenders			1
@entity157 did a job against @entity78			2
the 33 - year - old was a catalyst at centre back ( as his heat and pass maps below show ) and escaped with a near - perfect 90.4 per cent passing accuracy , too			0
they have won every match in which he has played 90 minutes this year , and has done an adequate patch - up job in defence			1
who needs a @entity5 , right ? @entity157 's heat map ( left ) and pass map ( right ) showed the 33 - year - old 's influence against @entity78 @entity157 has done an excellent patch - up job as centre - back with @entity13 's defensive woes the 33 - year - old was a catalyst at the back for @entity19 , though @entity78 threatened to score against @entity92 wrong			1
the club ’s defensive frailty has been no secret			0
they ’ve conceded more ( 17 ) than @entity58 ( 14 ) and @entity57 ( 13 )			0
they lead the way with defensive errors ( 16 ) , too			0
@entity13 has felt this before as manager			0
in 1997 @entity2 had one of the worst defences in @entity45			0
they conceded 56 in 38 matches - their most since 1951 - and their highest since seasons containing 38 fixtures were introduced a decade before			0
yet they won @entity45 by nine points			0
but that was then , this is now			0
they remain a few cards short of a full deck , and are awaiting the cavalry to arrive from the treatment table or the january transfer window			0
@entity19 ( far left column ) are forced to make more interceptions , blocks and clearances than their rivals @entity19 remain a few cards short of a full deck and must wait for the cavalry to arrive from the treatment table midfield they say the mark of a good team is to play badly and win			1
well , @entity19 were average against @entity219 , and won 2 - 1			1
they were n't breathtaking against @entity78 , either , yet they won 3 - 0			2
and yet , in between , @entity13 is getting performances from players we never knew possible following @entity224 ' tenure			0
@entity226 , for example , was done for			0
he was photographed on crutches in august and a collective sigh swept across @entity228 because it meant the @entity230 midfielder would n't be leaving @entity41 for @entity231			2
a comparison of his season this year and last ( shown below ) demonstrates a rise in goals , tackles , chances created , aerial duels won and key passes			0
@entity240 , of all people , has improved			0
@entity226 has improved between this year and last in goals , tackles , chances , aerial duels and passes so , too , have @entity244 and @entity245			0
they could easily have been included in the defensive bracket but , as left and right wing - backs , they 've adapted to the 3 - 5 - 2 system			0
their percentages of successful take ons have risen			0
last year , @entity244 's 39.39 per cent and @entity253 's 45.90 were mediocre			2
this season , they have an identical record of 65 per cent			0
it 's a start , a sign of life after @entity224			2
not when @entity260 has made 72 successful take ons compared to @entity244 and @entity253 's collective 26 , as unfair a comparison that may be			2
but , with new additions such as @entity264 and @entity265 , the @entity47 suddenly does n't look as unrealistic as it did by the end of august			1
@entity244 ( left ) and @entity245 ( right ) have been deployed down the wing and given licence to run @entity244 's heat map against @entity78 ( left ) and @entity253 's heat map for the same match ( right ) as they won 3 - 0 a comparison of @entity244 and @entity253 this year and last shows they 're improving but having less shots forwards against @entity30 , @entity19 had three shots , the lowest by a @entity52 side this season and the least the club has managed since @entity280 was born 11 years ago			1
of those three shots - two were on target , and @entity283 scored both			0
against @entity78 , they scored with their first two shots			0
clinical , to say the least			0
dare we mention the ' l ' word ? @entity289 certainly comes with it , though their ruthlessness in the last six games is apparent when compared to their first 10 matches ( shown right )			0
their shot conversion has gone from 14.95 per cent to 25.49 , their shooting accuracy from 43.95 to 49.02 and their goals per game from 1.6 to 2.2			0
@entity283 has been clinical recently and remains @entity19 's top scorer after his latest against @entity78 7 - @entity304 6 - @entity305 5 - @entity306 3 - @entity307 2 - @entity226 & @entity265 @entity308 , @entity309 & @entity310 that is primarily down to their flying @entity15			1
his minutes per goal ratio , accordingly , has gone from 252.67 to 126.25			0
but he , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity314 , are starting to deliver			0
@entity309 , on the other hand , is doing little to convince he is worthy of becoming a permanent fixture at @entity41			0
@entity13 is working his magic			0
all hope that seemed lost last year has returned , though it would be misplaced in a title challenge			0
they 've rode their luck , hard at that , and have 18 points from 18 since november 8			1
a @entity47 return is in their grasp and , if that is what their @entity15 master can bring a year into the job , there 's no saying he ca n't go one further next			1
@entity19 have rode their luck but a @entity47 spot would go a long way towards next year			1

@entity19 sit third in the @entity52 after six straight wins
@entity0 rode his luck recently against @entity219 and @entity30
@entity19 are n't playing the best *football* but are still securing *important* wins
a @entity47 place is within their grasp and should be priority
@entity82 is being relied upon as @entity19 's defence is n't up to scratch
