by @entity0 and @entity1 rubbish record : under @entity6 ' watch , many places in the @entity4 have lost weekly bin collections , something he once called a ' fundamental right ' more than five million families have lost weekly bin collections since the government came to power , the @entity10 has discovered			1
communities secretary @entity6 declared two years ago that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘ fundamental right ’ – but cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch , with 60 councils introducing a fortnightly waste collection since may 2010			1
eleven authorities , including both @entity22 and @entity23 councils , have dumped weekly collections in the past year alone , with two more planning to follow suit soon			1
by the time of the election next year , 18.5million families will have lost weekly bin rounds			1
council leaders last night said that mr @entity6 ’ efforts to reverse the trend – including a £ 250million fund to persuade councils to keep weekly bin rounds – had been a ‘ sham and pr stunt ’			1
once - a - week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives			0
they were maintained until after @entity23 ’s 1997 election victory			0
but now councils are coming up with even more extreme measures in a bid to reduce collection costs			0
next month , @entity51 will cut collections to once every three weeks , and @entity53 is to fine residents who put out more than three bin bags a fortnight			2
mr @entity6 admitted last week he was powerless to stop the erosion of waste services – a dramatic concession after years of claims he could reverse the trend			2
back in 2012 , he announced a £ 250million fund that was meant to herald the return of weekly collections			1
some of the collection services have been reduced to even fewer than once a fortnight			0
these residents in @entity69 , @entity70 , have to wait three weeks for their rubbish to be collected while some councils used it to keep weekly collections , none have brought back weekly bin rounds and many have instead used the fund to increase recycling schemes			1
@entity23 - run @entity79 was given £ 500,000 to protect weekly collections for 30,000 flats in high - rise blocks			1
but it said had it been given more it would have been able to keep weekly rounds at 210,000 homes which have since been scrapped			0
councillor @entity86 , the council ’s environment boss , said : ‘ it was obvious from the start that this £ 250million fund was nothing more than a sham and a pr stunt			2
‘ we wrote to @entity6 several times making it clear that we wanted to keep weekly collections if he would give us the money			1
the truth is , more councils have been forced to move to alternate week collections since this government came to power due to the unprecedented level of cuts			0
’ @entity103 , @entity23 ’s communities spokesman , said : ‘ it ’s a disgrace that @entity6 wasted £ 250million on his bin scheme , which shows that while he talks a lot he ca n’t deliver			2
’ @entity107 , @entity108 , said the @entity109 had safeguarded weekly bin collections for six million homes but mr @entity6 said last week that his actions had stopped the movement towards universal fortnightly collections			1
he told the @entity115 : ‘ it is a matter for local authorities , but what i have done is remove the inevitability of fortnightly collections			0
we have made a big difference			0
’ mr @entity6 ' @entity123 , which only has authority over councils in @entity126 , claims that it has slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections			2
before the @entity109 came into power in 2010 councils were actively encouraged to move towards less frequent bin rounds			0
the @entity132 , which is @entity23 - led , still has a policy of adopting fortnightly rounds			0
@entity107 , @entity108 , said : ' our weekly collections support scheme has safeguarded the weekly service of six million homes and axed the @entity140 ’s policy of forcing fortnightly collections for all			1
' we have scrapped @entity23 ’s plans for new bin taxes , are reining in unfair bin fines and axed bin snoopers ’ powers of entry into your home			0
' yes , there is more to do – but contrast our record with the @entity23 - led @entity132 , which has killed off weekly collections and now wants monthly bin collections			2
' it is a myth that fortnightly collections are needed to save money or increase recycling , peddled by town hall bureaucrats and bin barons who do n’t care about frontline services			0

@entity6 said two years ago having bins emptied was ' fundamental right '
since he became @entity164 , 5 million lost weekly collections
council leaders claim £ 250 million *pledge* to help is ' a sham '
some councils only collect bins once every three weeks
