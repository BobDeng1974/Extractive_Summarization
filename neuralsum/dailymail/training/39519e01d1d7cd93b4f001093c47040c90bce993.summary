by @entity0 published : 08:43 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:55 est , 25 november 2013 the @entity3 has sparked fury after it approved a plan for a ' social police ' to control benefits handouts , healthcare and homelessness across the continent			1
the plan is among a raft of measures laid out in a new report that calls for the creation of a ' social scoreboard ' to allow for a ' better and earlier identification of major employment and social problems '			1
but the plan , approved by a majority of the @entity22 sitting in @entity23 last week , triggered anger among conservative meps who claim the @entity3 is attempting to impose itself as ' @entity27 's social conscience			1
' controversial : the plan was approved by a majority of the @entity22 sitting in @entity23 last week prompting anger among conservative meps who attempted to have the measures thrown out @entity33 , @entity34 spokesman on employment and social affairs , said : ' clearly this is the @entity22 manoeuvring to create a role for the @entity3 as @entity27 's social conscience			1
' worse than that , they want to appropriate powers to supervise and intervene over the way member states deal with social problems			1
they want to set themselves up as the social police			0
' nobody is saying poverty , ill health and homelessness are not real problems in need of real solutions			1
what we are saying is that individual states and governments must be allowed to address them as they see fit , not according to a set of rules set down in @entity63			0
' sadly , my @entity64 and @entity67 colleagues appear to think @entity69 voters are not responsible or compassionate enough to decide for themselves how to respond			0
' angry : @entity33 @entity33 branded the move as an attempt to create ' social police ' under the title ' @entity74 of the @entity75 ' , the report , by @entity78 mep @entity77 , seeks to treat ' social imbalances on the same footing as economic indicators such as gross domestic product or national debt , ' she added			0
the report calls for a ' social scoreboard ' to score member states on measures such as child - poverty levels , access to healthcare , homelessness on a ' decent - work index '			1
but @entity34 @entity93 say that , although the report is presented in the context of the single currency , there is no clause exempting countries outside the @entity100 , such as the @entity69			2
the text also makes references to a @entity104 , ms @entity33 said , claiming it betrayed a ' clear ambition for @entity63 to control benefits payments across @entity27 '			2
however , the @entity108 ( @entity109 ) called the plan ' a potential watershed moment in economic governance ' , adding : ' with one out of four people in the @entity3 at risk of poverty or social exclusion and 11 per cent unemployment , it is clear that the current approach has not delivered on the @entity27 2020 poverty and employment targets			1
' this resolution will convey that a much stronger commitment is required from the @entity3 and @entity124 to achieve the social objectives of the @entity3			2
' @entity127 president @entity126 added : ' the @entity3 has taken giant leaps forward in terms of economic governance in the last five years , providing financial lifelines to many vulnerable member @entity124			2
vital reform : @entity127 president @entity126 said the plans would ensure there is a ' strong social dimension in the way we run our @entity139 ' ' from the start of the crisis , we have taken targeted action to deal with the social distress created in part of our societies			0
' but the severity of the crisis , particularly in the euro area , has taught us that we need to work even more closely to heal the social scars it has left behind			0
' this communication is about building on the rules we have already put in place under the @entity154 to ensure there is a strong social dimension in the way we run our @entity139			0
we owe that to the 26 million unemployed and the most deprived in our society			0

the plan will create ' social scoreboard ' to rate countries on social matters
they *include* poverty - levels , health care , benefits and *housing* policy
furious @entity34 meps claim @entity3 is *angling* to be ' @entity27 's social conscience '
they claim @entity3 wants to appropriate powers to supervise and intervene over the way member states deal with social problems '
