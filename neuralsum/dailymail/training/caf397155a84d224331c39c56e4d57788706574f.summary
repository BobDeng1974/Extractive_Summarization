@entity5 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , managed to make his way though a three mile - long system of underground tunnels carrying 65lb of equipment to reach the never - before - seen cave			1
' finding something as special as @entity33 is very much every cave explorer ’s dream , ' says @entity5			1
‘ being the first to find something special or unique is a quite incredible feeling			2
i have never lost the passion for this			0
the name speaks volumes about the beauty and grandeur of the place , ’ @entity5 was stunned to find himself in the huge cave half a mile underground it is a challenge to find anything new and previously undiscovered in the present age , but underground it is a different story , says the diving instructor			1
' we are constantly finding new stuff , ' he reveals			0
‘ now it ’s wide open and we have a system of passages running to over three - miles in length – with many more miles still to come			2

‘ hypothermia in the ten degree temperature is always a concern			0
‘ if you are caving beyond a dive then you really must not get injured because you need to be fully mobile , fit and healthy to kit yourself up and dive out			0

we all know this , so we prepare thoroughly and take care			0
‘ my philosophy in this respect is simple - do n’t have the accident			0
