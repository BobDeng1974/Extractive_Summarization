@entity8 said the @entity1 's involvement against @entity11 fighters in @entity6 will continue to be in a supportive role , by @entity14 planes taking part in air strikes , and helping to arm @entity18 troops			1
the defence secretary said western countries had learned from previous conflicts that the war against @entity23 would only be won by ' home troops ' , but that @entity1 and the @entity25 can support them			1
defence secretary : @entity8 said the @entity1 's involvement against is fighters in @entity6 will continue to be in a supportive role , by @entity14 planes taking part in air strikes , and helping to arm @entity18 troops his comments come after foreign secretary , @entity35 , admitted there was nothing the international coalition fighting is militants can do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for the strategically important @entity7 town of @entity43			1
@entity11 is threatening to overrun the lightly - armed @entity18 defenders of the town , which is close to the border with @entity47 , despite @entity25 air strikes on the extremists ' position			2
the battle has sparked major protests in @entity47 against its government 's perceived inaction and @entity25 secretary of state @entity55 said he was deeply concerned about the situation			2
speaking to the @entity60 's today programme , mr @entity8 said neighbouring countries had a duty to stop @entity6 and @entity7 ' falling apart ' , but stopped short of urging @entity47 to get involved in the conflict			1
' @entity47 could help , but it 's a matter for @entity47 , ' he said			2
' other allies have been helping , from the south @entity67 countries and @entity68 were helping with strikes			0
strike : a picture taken from @entity47 shows smoke rising after an airstrike , thought to have been carried out by a coalition plane on @entity4 targets in the west of @entity43 , @entity7 fear : @entity11 is threatening to overrun the lightly - armed @entity18 defenders of the town , which is close to the border with @entity47 , despite @entity25 air strikes on the extremists ' position ' this is a situation that can not be resolved by @entity25 and @entity1			1
we 'd like @entity47 to be involved , but it 's a decision for their government			2
' mr @entity8 said there had been talks with the @entity47 government , and that @entity91 is ' very aware ' of the ' desperate ' situation in @entity43			1
' they will have to see whether they can help more , ' he said			0
he added : ' every country has its own position and comes to this from its own position			0
they have had difficulty with @entity18 extremism in the past , such as hostages			0
' every country in the region has got to see what it can contribute against @entity23 or we will have @entity6 falling apart and @entity7 falling apart and that 's a danger for the entire region			1
' mr @entity8 said that it was in @entity1 's interest for @entity6 and @entity7 not to collapse at the hands of @entity11 , but said the @entity112 would continue to act in a supportive role			1
plight : newly - arrived @entity7 @entity18 refugees carry their belongings after crossing into @entity47 from @entity43 ' there is a very direct @entity1 interest in making sure the @entity120 does not fall apart , and that terrorism is not exported back to @entity122 , ' he said			1
' the legitimate government in @entity6 will have asked for help , i do n't think it would be right for @entity1 with its air power and other resources to stand apart and leave it to the @entity129 or the @entity25			1
' he added : ' we 're not portraying ourselves as the saviours of the @entity120 , we are helping			0
' mr @entity8 said ground forces would ultimately be the ones to push back @entity11 , but maintained that @entity1 soldiers would not be involved in this			1
' this can only be won in the end by ground forces , but it can only be won by the home army not an army from the @entity142			1
' that is the hard lesson we have learned			0
' we can stiffen up the army , supply ammunition to @entity18 forces and use air power to provide support for operations on the ground			0
help : a @entity152 returns to @entity153 in @entity154 following an afternoon armed mission to @entity6 air power : mr @entity8 said @entity14 flights have been flying on missions out of @entity153 ' every day and night ' ' we can help , and we should help			1
' we have got to keep reviewing the campaign			0
at the moment we are here at the request of the @entity6 government and air power is a key part of that , as is stiffening up the @entity6 army and making sure it is properly equipped			2
' mr @entity8 also said @entity1 action would continue to focus on @entity6 , rather than @entity7			1
' we have made it clear that @entity23 has to be defeated in @entity7 and @entity6 but we do n't have the authority to support in @entity7 at the moment			2
' there is plenty for us to do in @entity6 and the @entity14 are flying missions every day and night			0
there is plenty for us to be getting on with in @entity6 and pressure from @entity23 is coming from bases in @entity7			2
that 's why we welcome what @entity25 is doing there			0
' he added : ' if we find there is a contribution we can make in @entity7 and it is lawful we can do it , but at the moment we do n't have the authority from @entity189			0
' asked if @entity1 would become more involved in the fight against @entity11 militants he said : ' this is the international community 's fight and the collapse of @entity6 , or if @entity7 gets worse , that will affect us all			1
' there could be terrorist strikes across @entity122 as ( is fighters ) are returning to countries as far apart as @entity199 and @entity200			0
' mr @entity8 said the proposal for a @entity47 ' buffer zone ' along the border inside @entity7 where refugees fleeing the fighting could be protected was being considered			1
he said that @entity25 special envoy to @entity7 , former general @entity207 , would be holding talks with the @entity47 government of president @entity210 to establish what contribution @entity91 would make to the coalition			2
foreign secretary : @entity35 admitted that the coalition 's focus on air strikes meant there was nothing it could do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for @entity221 and acknowledged the town could fall to @entity11 ' we have the air power to help with it , ' he said			1
' that 's something @entity226 is discussing with the @entity47 government today			0
last night , mr @entity35 admitted that the coalition 's focus on air strikes meant there was nothing it could do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for @entity221 and acknowledged the town could fall to @entity11			0
he told @entity234 's @entity235 : ' the @entity25 has implemented some additional air strikes to try and help the people who are defending @entity221 but it is a very difficult situation on the ground and we have never envisaged that the coalition 's intervention with air power in this battle was going to turn the tide in the short term			0
' we have got to degrade @entity23 's military capability over time , that is n't going to happen overnight			0
' so i do n't want to suggest that there is anything readily that the coalition can do that will make a fundamental difference on the ground in this battle , in the tactical situation that 's faced around @entity221			0
' he said : ' self evidently it could fall			0
the @entity25 are committed to doing what they can to support the defence the town with additional air strikes			0
cautious : @entity25 secretary of state @entity55 ( right ) and mr @entity35 ( left ) have reacted cautiously to a @entity47 proposal to establish a ' buffer zone ' ' but this is a long struggle here against a poisonous ideology and an organisation which has built up some very significant military capabilities			1
' although we the coalition are confident that we will win that strategic battle we can not say with confidence that we will be able to win any specific tactical engagement			0
' both mr @entity55 and mr @entity35 have reacted cautiously to a @entity47 proposal to establish a ' buffer zone '			1
' if @entity7 citizens can return to @entity7 and be protected in an area across the border there 's a lot that would commend that , ' he said			2
' but at the same time you 'd have to guarantee safety , guarantee there would n't be attacks by the government			0
' it needs a thorough examination			0
' mr @entity35 added : ' we would have to explore with other allies and partners what is meant by a buffer zone , how such a concept would work , but i certainly would n't want to rule it out at this stage			1
' meanwhile , the foreign secretary sought to reassure the @entity25 that @entity1 would be prepared to join air strikes on is militants in @entity7 , if requested by @entity25 commanders			1
mr @entity35 indicated ministers would be prepared to go back to @entity189 to seek permission to extend @entity1 military action into @entity7 if @entity310 ( @entity310 ) considered it ' militarily useful '			1
' we absolutely have not ruled out playing a role in @entity7 , ' he said			0
' we will require further parliamentary approval if we decide that that is the right thing for us to do			0
' we would see this as a military question - is there a militarily useful role that @entity1 assets could play			2
' if @entity310 commanders see a specific role for @entity1 military assets i am sure that they will not be slow in requesting them			2

says @entity120 has a duty to prevent @entity6 and @entity7 ' falling apart '
