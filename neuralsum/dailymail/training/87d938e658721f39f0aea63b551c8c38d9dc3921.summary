she 's toured a museum and hosted the @entity3 president on a state visit already this week but there appears to be no let up in @entity8 @entity7 's busy schedule			1
today , @entity10 's newest monarch spent the day chairing a charity meeting at the @entity12 in @entity13 , where she was joined by some of @entity16 's ministers			1
among them were @entity18 , the minister of health , social services and equality , and @entity22 , the minister for public works , but despite the high calibre guests , all eyes were on the @entity8 herself			0
along with the two ministers , queen @entity7 is part of the council of the @entity44 and has long worked to improve the lot of those with physical and mental problems			1
work is something the former newsreader has plenty of experience of and , fresh from a month - long break in @entity55 with her husband @entity56 , 46 , it has been back to work with a vengeance for @entity7			2
yesterday saw the 41 - year - old royal welcome @entity59 , @entity3 's first lady , to the @entity12 as part of an official state visit			0
high powered : the royal was joined by @entity16 ministers @entity18 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) hot fuzz : the 46 - year - old king returned from his holiday with a beard while @entity7 was as glamorous as ever back to work : following a month off in @entity55 , the @entity16 royals have returned to a packed schedule pretty in a cream dress embroidered with seed pearls , @entity7 showed off her glamorous sense of style , accessorising the look with nude patent peep toe shoes and pearl earrings			2
not to be outdone , @entity56 , dapper in a dark suit , showed off his salt - and - pepper holiday beard - a new look for the usually clean - shaven royal			0
the visit was one of the first engagements of an action - packed schedule planned for the next month , including a visit to @entity88			0
there , the @entity16 king will address the @entity90 in a bid to secure one of the seats on the @entity94 for @entity16			0
elegant : queen @entity7 was chic in a knee - length cream frock embroidered with seed pearl flowers @entity99 glow : both @entity56 and @entity8 @entity7 looked refreshed and happy following their holiday lots to do : later this month , the couple will travel to @entity88 so @entity56 can make a speech to the @entity90 looking good : despite being busier than ever , queen @entity105 has remained a glamorous dresser			1
