@entity0 never ceases to amaze in the improbable scenarios it can throw up			0
what goes around ... comes around			0
@entity4 took a financial hit of £ 35million when they let @entity6 and @entity7 go to @entity8 back in august			1
both were expensive acquisitions who failed to make the grade at @entity13 and , with better options available , @entity4 decided to cut their losses			0
now , the two rejected ones could repay that lost money by helping the @entity8 to a win over champions - elect @entity20 on sunday and deliver the title to @entity23 for the first time in 24 years			1
and @entity8 , despite their 2 - 0 win over @entity53 last time out , have n't exactly been brilliant this campaign , raising serious doubts over whether @entity25 will keep his job			0
but last - day jitters are to be expected at the @entity59 and @entity8 could pounce like @entity60 almost did two years ago			0
they led @entity20 2 - 1 until the very last minute , allowing @entity62 to believe they had stolen the title , until @entity64 and @entity65 struck to win the title in the most dramatic of circumstances			0
@entity8 are 18 - 1 with the bookies to win on sunday , but what price @entity6 or @entity7 popping up to score and leave every @entity20 fan gnawing their nails ? it would certainly spark wild celebrations at @entity13 , where @entity4 are playing @entity36 and praying for a miracle			1
last minute drama : @entity65 celebrates with @entity64 after scoring the goal that won @entity20 the @entity35 title in 2012 all right in the end : @entity20 will be desperate to avoid the last - day drama of their 3 - 2 win over @entity60 when they take on @entity8 on sunday @entity82 ? @entity8 will hope to exploit @entity20 's perceived weak link ( right ) their surrender of a three - goal lead at @entity86 on monday night , coupled with @entity20 's result , means they are relying on an unlikely combination of events			1
yet @entity6 and @entity7 could have something to say about it			2
the @entity31 frontman was tipped for great things when @entity4 splashed out £ 35million for his services in january 2011			2
as he arrived from @entity36 , @entity95 moved through the exit door in his @entity98 record £ 50million move and @entity100 clearly believed it was sound business			0
bright beginnings : there were high hopes for @entity6 when he joined @entity4 from @entity36 for £ 35m in january 2011 on target : @entity6 celebrates with @entity107 after scoring against @entity23 rivals @entity108 in the @entity110 semi-final at @entity111 but plagued by injuries , he struggled to make much impression at @entity13 and made just nine appearances that season			1
his first goals for @entity4 did come against @entity20 , perhaps a little omen for sunday			1
in all , @entity6 scored 11 goals in 58 outings for @entity4 , a below average return for the amount of money invested in him , and when @entity125 came in promising to restore free - flowing football , the writing was on the wall			2
more of a battering ram striker , @entity6 was simply not compatible with @entity125 ' vision of the ' @entity130 ' and a loan spell at @entity132 was made permanent in august 2013			0
that 's better : @entity6 has performed better at @entity8 since his move despite an injury - plagued season with @entity107 hitting top form and @entity137 later joining from @entity138 , @entity4 were quite prepared to take a £ 20m loss on @entity6			1
@entity7 was bought from @entity41 for £ 20million in the summer of 2011			2
the winger , an established @entity31 international , was ready to make the step up to a side that could challenge for the title and compete in the @entity144			0
he won the @entity145 in his first season at @entity13 , and was man of the match in the final , but he finished the @entity35 season with no goals and no assists			0
unveiling : @entity7 is introduced as a @entity4 player following his £ 20m move from @entity41 rare goal : @entity7 celebrates scoring against @entity156 in the @entity157 at @entity13 in october 2012 the following campaign did n't see an improvement in his fortunes and @entity7 contributed just five goals and nine assists in 45 appearances , ultimately losing his place in the @entity31 team			1
again , @entity125 saw that better options were available and , once again deciding to take a hit on the decisions of a previous regime , sold him to @entity8 for just £ 5million			2
given the strength of @entity4 's title challenge this season , @entity125 was vindicated in his decisions but the @entity4 boss would certainly be willing to accept a favour from either of them to achieve his title dream on sunday .			1

@entity4 bought @entity6 for £ 35m and @entity7 for £ 20m in 2011
both were sold to @entity8 back in august for a combined £ 35m
now duo could decide the title race in @entity4 's favour on sunday
@entity6 and @entity7 will line up for @entity8 at title favourites @entity20
