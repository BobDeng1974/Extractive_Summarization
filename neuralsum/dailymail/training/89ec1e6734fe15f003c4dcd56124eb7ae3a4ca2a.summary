by @entity0 and @entity1 many buildings in @entity3 , @entity4 have not been changed to prevent earthquake damage even as today marks the 20th anniversary of the disaster that struck the area of northern @entity9			1
while there has been progress to rebuild and shore up freeways and hospitals , there has been less attention paid to concrete buildings and housing with ground - floor parking			1
' that remains a significant problem			0
we really have not come very far , ' said @entity22 , an earthquake engineer at the @entity23 , @entity9			1
sudden : @entity9 police officer @entity24 , whose body is covered by a blanket as his colleagues as they investigate , was one of the victims in the 1994 quake which was a 6.7 - magnitude disaster damage : the january 17 , 1994 @entity32 earthquake was felt over a broad area of @entity4 , causing widespread death and destruction at 4.31am on january 17 , 1994 , the ground shuddered beneath the bedroom community of @entity32 , due to a magnitude - 6.7 earthquake			1
after the shaking stopped , sections of the city laid in fiery tatters			0
several dozens died and 9,000 were injured			2
the quake caused $ 25billion in damage - the costliest @entity47 natural disaster at the time			1
the largest cluster of deaths occurred at the @entity52 complex where 16 people were killed when their first - floor apartments crashed onto the parking garage below			1
the city does n't keep count of how many so - called soft - story buildings exist and does n't require mandatory repairs even after 1994 because many such buildings survived the shaking			2
the @entity9 @entity62 recently proposed surveying 30,000 apartments built before 1978 to determine which might be compromised during violent shaking as a first step toward possible retrofitting			2
preventative measures : the state has made strides in retrofitting freeways and hospitals , especially after what happened on the @entity73 as seen here small victories : because the earthquake happened at 4.31am , there were very few people on the highway the department has yet to receive funding to start the work			1
after @entity32 , the city required fixes to some 200 steel - frame high - rise buildings that unexpectedly suffered cracked welds and 2,750 concrete tilt - up buildings - erected with concrete walls and lifted into place by cranes - that were poorly designed			1
both types of repairs were relatively easy and did not bankrupt property owners			0
even so , computer simulations released this week by the @entity94 and @entity95 found mid-rise steel buildings performed differently depending on the type of welding			0
other retrofits were voluntary including efforts to buttress concrete - frame buildings			2
there are about 1,500 such buildings in @entity104 and between 16,000 and 17,000 statewide			0
only about 10 to 15 per cent are considered dangerous , said @entity105 , who led a study by the @entity107 , a volunteer group of scientists , engineers and governments			0
earlier this week , the city announced it would partner with the @entity95 to develop a plan to address seismic safety , including ways to get privately - owned buildings to be more quake - proof			1
' we 're as well prepared as any city in @entity47 , which is to say we 're unprepared , ' mayor @entity117 said in an interview with the @entity1			2
tragic : a multimillion - dollar home in the @entity122 fell off a cliff during the quake ( left ) and rescue workers were sent out to the @entity127 apartments ( right ) where most of the casualties occurred ' i do n't think anybody in @entity47 is very well prepared ... there 's always going to be an earthquake we ca n't be prepared for			1
' at least 57 people died , according to the state			1
a 1995 study put the death toll at 72 , including heart attacks			0
despite the lag in reinforcing potentially dangerous buildings , strides have been made in beefing up state - owned freeways and bridges by wrapping support columns with jackets of steel			1
several freeway bridges that collapsed or were heavily damaged had been retrofitted decades earlier , but the efforts were limited to tying structures together using restrainers at the bridge joints			0
since @entity32 , the @entity154 spent more than $ 1 billion to further brace 1,155 bridges identified as at - risk			1
only two projects remained - a freeway overpass in @entity159 that 's scheduled to be completed this fall and the @entity160 in @entity161 that 's due in 2017			0
two hospitals suffered major structural damage , prompting lawmakers to require hospitals statewide to strengthen buildings so they can still treat patients after a disaster			0
out of 1,313 hospital buildings deemed at risk for collapse , 69 percent have been retrofitted , replaced or demolished			1
the work continues despite extended deadlines			0
fire and water : a ruptured supply line burned in the water on @entity178 in @entity179 , which was just some of the $ 25billion - worth of damage @entity32 was the last deadly quake to strike a @entity47 metropolitan area			1
a student and resident adviser at @entity187 , @entity32 , @entity183 awoke to a messy dorm room and a waterlogged bathroom after the toilet came off its base			2
though the school was on winter break , some students stayed behind			0
with a candle in hand , @entity183 dodged broken glass in the hallway , knocking on students ' doors to get them to safety			0
' this was n't my first rodeo when @entity32 happened , ' said @entity183 , who also survived the @entity206 quake that rocked the @entity207 during the @entity208			1
those born after 1994 have never experienced a major temblor			0
and for many who lived through @entity32 , 20 years of relative seismic calm may lull some into a false sense of security			1
' people forget , ' said @entity216 , who heads the @entity217 at the @entity218			0
' it 's been ungodly quiet from a seismic point of view since @entity32			2
' far from a film set : the disaster happened on the north end of @entity9 , where @entity225 looks over the charred remains of his home to prevent amnesia , scientists and emergency responders have held an annual preparedness drill since 2008 to educate @entity232 and residents in other quake - prone states to ' duck , cover and hold on ' during shaking			1
@entity32 exposed a hidden fault			2
afterward , scientists scoured for similar geologic structures lurking around the @entity9 basin			2
five years later , they discovered the @entity242 fault that runs underneath downtown @entity9 that could cause far greater damage			1
budget cuts through the years have slowed efforts to map potentially dangerous fault lines			0
by seismic standards , @entity32 was n't a monster in terms of its strength or the destruction it wrought			2
@entity32 did n't cause mass casualties like the 2010 quake in @entity254 did , but a future quake certainly could			1
if a segment of the 800 - mile - long @entity257 unzipped and unleashed the ' @entity258 ' as scientists call it , it would cause far greater chaos to lives , properties and lifelines including roads , pipelines and telecommunication systems			0
despite intense study , there 's no magic bullet that allows scientists to predict when a quake would hit			0
' we 're chipping away at it , ' @entity23 's @entity22 said of the retrofit process			0
' we 're not where we would like to be , but we are making progress toward hardening the system			0

the last deadly earthquake in @entity47 took place 20 years *ago* today
16 people died when a 6.7 - magnitude quake rocked @entity32 , an area in the northern part of @entity9
freeways and highways were retrofitted to make them more safe but a number of lower - lying buildings are still at risk
