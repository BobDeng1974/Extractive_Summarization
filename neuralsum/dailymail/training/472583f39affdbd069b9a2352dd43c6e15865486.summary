an inspiring @entity1 project to land a spacecraft on the moon in 10 years has completed its funding target today			1
the @entity6 project reached its £ 600,000 ( $ 938,170 ) goal on crowdfunding site @entity8 , with 36 hours to go			1
for £ 60 ( $ 94 ) , backers have the opportunity to buy space on memory discs that will be sent to the moon , and , for an undisclosed price , they are able to send a sample of their dna			1
while the discs have raisede money for the mission , its main aim is to analyse the @entity34 and assess its potential for a possible human base to be developed in the future			0
a probe will also drill 330ft ( 100 metres ) below the surface to look at whether it will be possible to someday have observatories on the moon			1
up until now , there have been no missions to the moon 's @entity34 , which is of particular interest because its home to the largest impact crater on the @entity50 , the @entity52 ( @entity53 ) basin			1
@entity54 : the @entity6 project reached its £ 600,000 ( $ 938,170 ) goal on crowdfunding site @entity8 the @entity53 has a diameter of 1,550 miles ( 2,500km ) and covers almost a quarter of the moon			1
scientists believe remnants from the @entity53 impact may still be present in this area , and analysis of the material may be used to date the basin			2
the @entity6 vehicle will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket , such as @entity71 's @entity70 , before embarking on its journey to the moon			1
once there , it will carry out a descent sequence to the lunar surface , with four engines ensuring it lands gently within a pre-determined landing site the size of a football stadium			0
moon dust : once on the moon , the spacecraft will drill 100 metres ( 330 feet ) down to collect samples for scientific analysis ( illustrated )			1
it will collect samples every six inches ( 15cm ) , which will be scooped up and placed in the spacecraft for scientific analysis to answer questions about the moon on the surface it will drill to depths of up to 330 feet ( 100 metres ) , collecting samples every six inches ( 15cm ) for analysis on board the spacecraft			1
it 's thought that the top 33ft ( 10 metres ) of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles			1
further down , though , the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago			0
the deepest samples that have been obtained are from three metres below the surface , by @entity114 astronauts @entity115 and @entity116 in 1972			2
the company plans to send a robot lander to the @entity34 of the moon - an unexplored area			2
they will drill to a depth of at least 66ft ( 20 metres ) - 10 times deeper than has been drilled before - and potentially up to 330ft ( 100 metres )			1
the hole will be two inches ( 5cm ) in diameter , and it will take the lander one hour to drill each six inches ( 15cm )			0
core samples will taken from each six inches			0
it will then study lunar rock from this depth that is 4.5 billion years old , and has remain untouched underground			0
it 's thought the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles			1
further down , though , the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago			0
among the scientific questions hoping to be answered , @entity6 wants to discover the true origins of the moon			0
the spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket such as @entity71 's @entity70			2
it will carry out a staged descent sequent to the lunar surface			0
four main engines will ensure it lands gently on the surface and keep it within a landing site the size of a football stadium			0
the spacecraft will be equipped not only with a drill , but also a jointed robotic arm to extract segments from its core , and other instruments to analyse core samples and monitor seismic @entity165 solar cells will power the lander			2
the samples of varying depths will be analysed on board the spacecraft inside special capsules ( illustrated )			0
it 's thought that the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles , while further down will be rock fused by heat inside the hole ( illustrated ) will be placed archived data from the public on @entity183			1
people can buy a space on the memory discs for £ 64 ( $ 100 )			1
the team are seeking funding now and hope to launch in 2024 among the scientific questions hoping to be answered , @entity6 wants to discover the true origins of the moon			0
@entity1 engineer and city financier @entity192 , who came up with the plan said : ' people can put any information they like in the memory disc ; it will be like a personal time capsule , a private archive			2
it could be a small message saying " hi , i 'm @entity203 " or a whole family history			0
' professor @entity205 , who is one of @entity6 's scientific advisers , said that despite more than 50 expeditions to the moon , far more needs to be done to understand our satellite			2
' until recently the @entity212 had plans for a lunar lander ( which has since been scrapped ) and the science case for @entity6 is quite similar , ' he told @entity216			0
' in addition , we propose to have a drill so there will be new science too '			0
members of the public have 36 hours to sign up to fund the mission using its @entity8 page			1

mission has reached its s £ 600,000 ( $ 938,170 ) goal on @entity8
backers have opportunity to bury their photos and dna on the moon
@entity1 - led mission to the moon is *due* to be completed in the next decade
it will drill 330ft ( 100 metres ) on moon to collect samples for analysis
the material collected could help explain how the @entity183 's moon formed
