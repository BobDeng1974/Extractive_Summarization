furious : the prime minister was given a dressing down by his own mps including @entity4 @entity5 has been given a humiliating dressing - down by his own mps over the ‘ failure ’ to get a grip on immigration			1
the prime minister was ‘ puce - faced ’ as @entity12 @entity7 queued up to challenge his record on reducing the flow of immigrants into the @entity16 and demand answers to what he was going to do about it			2
he was openly contradicted after praising home secretary @entity21 for doing a ‘ good job ’ on the controversial issue			1
outspoken @entity12 backbencher @entity4 rounded on mr @entity5 , saying : ‘ i do n’t think she ’s done a good job at all ! ’ the row came at a private meeting of @entity12 mps last week , held amid growing chaos in @entity30 where migrants are mounting increasingly frantic attempts to board @entity34 ferries or hide in @entity16 - bound vehicles			1
it also followed new figures casting doubt on mr @entity5 ’s stated ambition to cut net migration to below 100,000 by next may			0
official statistics show net migration ( the difference between those arriving in the @entity16 and those leaving ) was 243,000 in the year to march , up nearly 70,000 on the previous year			0
at the meeting , ex-minister @entity46 demanded to know ‘ what should we now say about our current immigration target ? ’ and mr @entity4 , mp for @entity51 in @entity52 , made a thinly veiled suggestion that the prime minister , mp for well - to - do @entity55 in @entity56 , was out of touch with other parts of the country			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t know about @entity56 or @entity60 , but where i represent there ’s a big problem with immigration			0
this latest set of figures is disastrous			0
why ca n’t you just tell the public that you can not control immigration while we ’re still in the @entity70 ? ’ witnesses said mr @entity5 turned ‘ a deep shade of puce ’ as mr @entity4 spoke			1
crisis : increasingly desperate migrants have converged on @entity30 wanting to cross the @entity76 via the port a second @entity79 mp also challenged the prime minister			1
@entity81 and @entity83 mp @entity82 told mr @entity5 that immigration was the ‘ number one issue ’ for local @entity12 voters			0
@entity89 sources last night denied there was a row , adding : ‘ these meetings are an important forum to exchange views			0
’ meanwhile , former @entity12 leader @entity95 yesterday warned @entity96 that it needed to ‘ get its act together ’ and deal with asylum seekers in @entity30 rather than blaming @entity16			2
the party grandee , home secretary from 1993 - 1997 and now @entity101 , said the mayor of @entity30 , @entity107 , was ‘ directing her frustration and her anger at the wrong target ’ by demanding that @entity109 ‘ take responsibility ’			2
bombshell : the defection of @entity113 mp @entity112 ( right ) has sent ripples through @entity115 ‘ the general principle which every member state of the @entity70 has subscribed to is that refugees , people fleeing persecution , should apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach , ’ he told @entity117 ’s today programme			0
@entity30 was last night braced for violence as the town prepared for a march today by @entity96 nationalists against the migrants			1
‘ we do n’t care where they go but we do n’t want them in our country , ’ one protester said			0
@entity136 , @entity30 sub-prefect , said there was a ‘ fraught climate ’ .			2

*tories* queued up to *criticise* *pm* after he said @entity21 did a good job
mp @entity4 replied *bluntly* : ' i do *n't* think she *'s* done a good job at all ! '
@entity149 was at private meeting as migrants tried to storm ferry in @entity153 of @entity30
