by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:59 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 07:01 est , 9 august 2012 @entity4 ’s economy will soon grind to a halt and a recovery is still years away , the @entity2 warned yesterday			1
it slashed its growth forecast for the year to zero , partly due to the effect of ‘ storm clouds ’ in the eurozone			2
it predicted growth of 0.8 per cent as recently as may – revised down from the 2 per cent forecast made last year			0
he said : ‘ it is not going to make the difference between having a recovery and not having a recovery			2
’ instead , he urged eurozone leaders to get to grips with the debt crisis tearing through the single currency bloc , describing it as ‘ a black cloud of uncertainty ’ over the global economy			1
gloom : governor sir @entity19 said the economy will not grow during 2012 ‘ it ’s a saga that goes on and on and on , ’ he said			1
‘ the idea that we have come to the end of it is unrealistic			0
there is still a long way to go			2
' anyone who pretends to know what ’s going to happen in the euro area over the next two or three years is simply not being realistic			0
’ a @entity49 spokesman said the @entity2 cited the eurozone as ‘ the biggest single threat to the @entity4 recovery ’			1
it comes as former deputy governor of the bank of england @entity54 told @entity56 's today programme that the @entity2 should have done more , sooner , when the credit crunch struck five years ago today			1
last month the @entity2 injected an additional £ 50 billion into the economy through its quantitative easing programme bringing the total stock to £ 375billion he said the @entity2 was slow to realise that exceptional measures were needed , adding : ' we 'd expected a correction in the markets , not a total meltdown '			1
meanwhile , sir @entity19 admitted he has no idea when a robust recovery will finally get under way			1
‘ we will get back to the same growth rates that we experienced before the crisis , but it ’s quite impossible to know over what time period , ’ he said			0
the economy is ‘ healing ’ but it will be ‘ a long , slow process ’ and the full recovery ‘ may lie some years ahead ’ , he added			1
chancellor @entity79 said the government must give ‘ 110 per cent attention and effort and energy to getting the economy moving ’			0
@entity85 admitted @entity4 ’s plunge into its longest and deepest downturn for more than a century has been ‘ disappointing ’ , but added : ‘ we just have to roll up our sleeves			0
’ economists described yesterday ’s inflation report as one of the most depressing ever , with predictions of economic growth peaking at just 2.25 per cent in 2014 and 2015			0
this is the lowest ‘ peak forecast ’ in the quarterly inflation reports since the @entity2 was granted independence in 1997			2
@entity97 , chief @entity4 economist at @entity98 , said : ‘ this is a material shift in @entity2 thinking			1
' @entity100 is not confident that we are going to see a return to the growth levels seen before the crisis			0
’ sir @entity19 , who retires next june , said : ‘ we are navigating through rough waters and storm clouds continue to roll in from the euro area			2
deflated : rampant price rises have fallen away and the @entity2 now believes inflation will fall below target in the coming years ‘ output has been at best broadly flat over the past two years , and has continually disappointed expectations of recovery			1
unlike the @entity116 who have thrilled us over the past fortnight , our economy has not yet reached full fitness			0
’ however , he added that the squeeze on family finances was finally ‘ coming to an end ’ as the cost of living falls			0
the consumer price index measure of inflation , which was as high as 5.2 per cent in september , has more than halved to 2.4 per cent and will continue to drop , he said			0
the @entity2 ’s report states that @entity128 is ‘ more likely than not to be around or a little below target [ 2 per cent ] ’ for some time			2
experts warned that weaker - than - expected growth will force the chancellor to borrow even more than planned as tax receipts slump			0
@entity134 , chief economist at the @entity135 , said : ‘ if the @entity2 ’s view on the economy comes to pass , the chancellor faces a very rough road with the public finances as he tries to cut the deficit			1
’ @entity141 , shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ it is clear that we can not go on with the same failing plan from this government			0
' the chancellor ’s policies are n’t only causing short - term pain , but long - term damage to our economy too			2
’ however , when asked if it was time for the government to ditch its attempts to tackle the deficit and adopt a fiscal plan b , sir @entity19 said : ‘ no. ’ the @entity2 ’s report also opened the door to a further round of quantitative easing , on top of the £ 375billion it has already unleashed in a desperate bid to spark a recovery .			1

economy will soon grind to a halt and recovery is a long way off @entity2 warns
double - dip recession is now the longest since 1950s
