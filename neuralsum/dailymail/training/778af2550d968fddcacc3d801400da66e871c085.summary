by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 07:25 est , 11 january 2014 a mother was rushed to hospital with stomach ache - and just two hours later gave birth to a baby boy she had no idea she was expecting			1
@entity8 , 43 , insisted last night as she held her third son , @entity9 : ' i could n't believe it ! ' the drama unfolded after she begged her partner , @entity13 , 42 , to take her to hospital after she was struck down by what she thought was stomach cramps last saturday afternoon			1
surprise : @entity18 at home in @entity20 with his mother @entity21 and his father @entity22			0
ms @entity8 had no idea she was pregnant and thought she was ill because of an acute wheat intolerance ms @entity8 , of @entity25 , @entity20 , thought she was ill because she suspected she had an acute wheat tolerance			1
' @entity21 phoned me on saturday because her stomach had swelled up , ' said mr @entity13 , a @entity29 employee			0
' she said she was so doubled over in pain she needed to get checked out for this wheat intolerance that her sister has			1
' unexpected : @entity9 's mother said she never believed women who said they had n't known they were pregnant - but she has changed her view now the receptionist at @entity37 and @entity40 's @entity39 department immediately asked @entity21 if she was pregnant			1
' we both said ' no ' , ' said mr @entity13			0
' but then the doctor came and said @entity21 was pregnant , congratulated us and said her contractions were five minutes apart			2
' not only had we just been told that @entity21 was pregnant but that she was in labour too			2
' the baby 's heart rate then dramatically started to drop			0
so ms @entity8 was rushed for an emergency caesarean section , but doctors then had to change their plans because she had started to give birth naturally			1
after entering @entity39 at about 1.25pm , the couple welcomed their third son , @entity9 , into the world at 3.25pm			2
' at first i was frightened about not bonding with the baby because i had n't had the pregnancy to prepare , ' admitted ms @entity8			1
' but as soon as they put the baby into your arms , you bond immediately			0
' i just wanted him to be okay			0
' i just kept thinking , " how did he survive in there for all that time without me knowing ? " ' the couple broke the news to family and friends and said it has taken a few days for @entity9 's shock arrival to sink in			0
ms @entity8 said she was even doing 100 abdominal crunches a night before @entity70 in a bid to get rid of the ' muffin top ' she said she had developed in the summer			1
' i thought the weight was due to me not eating properly , pigging out and not exercising - but i was still doing my size 12 trousers up , ' said the mother - of - three			2
' i was running on our treadmill until we moved house at the end of september to try and get rid of the weight i had put on during the summer			0
' ms @entity8 was rushed to @entity37 and @entity40 's @entity39 department where she gave birth the couple have been delighted with the reaction of their two other sons - @entity88 , six , and @entity89 , four - who could not have been happier to have a new little baby brother			1
' they were really excited and have been very protective of him ever since he came home , ' said ms @entity8			1
she said she thought there would be people who do not believe her story because she was always cynical about similar tales herself			2
' i am the first person who sees these stories in the papers and on the television and says , " of course you know when you are pregnant , " ' she said			2
' i have had two boys - i felt rough almost all the way through pregnancy with both of them			0
' i had heartburn , sickness , could n't eat properly and i was huge			0
' but now i am sat here eating humble pie because it has happened to me			0
