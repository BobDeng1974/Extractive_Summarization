by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 09:06 est , 21 february 2013 @entity2 founder @entity1 has joined @entity4 co-founder @entity3 , @entity6 chairman @entity5 and a host of @entity9 's biggest names to launch their own equivalent of the @entity11			2
the @entity12 is a £ 10m ( $ 15m ) prize that rewards researchers who work at ' curing intractable diseases and extending human life			1
' @entity1 , whose wife @entity1 is also involved in the award , said he hopes that it helps society recognize more engineers and scientists as ' heroes '			1
@entity2 ceo @entity1 , left , at the launch of the @entity12 @entity24 : maps of the human genome @entity27 : discovered the @entity28 and its role in cancer metabolism			1
@entity32 : research into adult stem cells			0
@entity35 : her research on the role of telomeres in genome instability in cancer won her the award			0
@entity42 : he was praised for his work on cancer genes and targeted therapy			0
@entity47 : he was honoured for describing the role of @entity49 signalling in tissue stem cells and cancer			0
@entity52 : discoveries of mechanisms of angiogenesis that led to therapies for cancer and eye diseases			1
@entity59 : work on cancer genomics and tumor surpressor genes @entity63 : characterisation of cancer genes was honoured			0
@entity66 : research on genetics of neural circuits and behaviour , and synaptic guidepost molecules			0
' @entity1 and i are honored to be part of this , ' @entity1 said at an event to launch the new foundation			0
' we believe the @entity12 has the potential to provide a platform for other models of philanthropy , so people everywhere have an opportunity at a better future			1
' @entity6 chairman @entity5 will serve as the chairman of the foundation			0
the foundation has already selected 11 winners for this year , including neurobiologist @entity66 , geneticist @entity47 and molecular biologist @entity88 , each of whom will receive $ 3 million			1
it plans to award five annual prizes similar to the way the @entity11 works			1
mr @entity3 , who attented the launch wearing his firm 's @entity96 headset , said : ' curing a disease should be worth more than a touchdown , ' making reference to the huge salaries of sportsmen			1

' i believe this new prize will shine a light on the extraordinary achievements of the outstanding minds in the field of life sciences , enhance medical innovation , and ultimately become a platform for recognizing future discoveries			1
' i also want to thank our founding sponsors , @entity3 , @entity117 , @entity1 , @entity1 and @entity118			0
' without their contribution , this prize would not have been possible			0
' @entity118 said the award was not competing with the @entity11			0

' @entity4 co-founder @entity3 wears @entity140 glasses at an announcement for the @entity12 in @entity142			1
dr @entity66 , right , was one of those honoured for her work in genetic research ' we are thrilled to support scientists who think big , take risks and have made a significant impact on our lives , ' said @entity117 , the founder of genetic testing company 23andme and wife of @entity4 's @entity3			2
' these scientists should be household names and heros in society , ' she said			2
recipients will also be invited to present public talks , similar to the popular @entity160 talks			0
' these lectures , together with supporting materials , will be made available to the public , allowing everyone to keep abreast of the latest developments in life sciences , guided by contemporary masters of the field , ' the organisation said .			2

@entity12 aims to recognise engineers and scientists as ' heroes '
will offer fives prizes of £ *2m* ( $ *3m* ) each year to people ' curing intractable diseases and extending human life '
