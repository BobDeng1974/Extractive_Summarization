two academics have highlighted the health benefits of masturbation - and say it can help conditions such as cystitis it is a subject that has provoked a host of myths , from causing blindness and insanity to the loss of vital organs			1
now two academics are on a mission to set the record straight about masturbation - and highlight all the health benefits it can bring			2
@entity18 , a public health scientist at the @entity20 and his colleague @entity21 , a senior lecturer , say self - pleasuring can ward off a host of illnesses , from cystitis , diabetes to prostate cancer			1
they say that 94 per cent of men admit to masturbating , as do 85 per cent of women - and that it 's something even babies do from the time they are in the womb			1
writing for @entity36 , a website where academics write opinion pieces , they say : ' for women , masturbation can help prevent cervical infections and urinary tract infections through the process of " tenting , " or the opening of the cervix that occurs as part of the arousal process			2
' @entity49 stretches the cervix , and thus the cervical mucous			0
this enables fluid circulation , allowing cervical fluids full of bacteria to be flushed out			0
' they add that engaging in self - pleasure can also ' lower the risk of type - 2 diabetes ( though this association may also be explained by greater overall health ) , reduce insomnia through hormonal and tension release , and increase pelvic floor strength through the contractions that happen during orgasm			2
' then there is cancer prevention			0
studies have shown that men who regularly have sex may have a lower risk of prostate cancer - perhaps due to the release of toxins from the prostate gland - and they say that masturbation achieves this same effect			0
the @entity80 pair also argue that it can help prevent depression , due to the ' happy ' endorphins produced and cause a slight hike in levels of the hormone cortisol , which may give the immune system a boost			1
it can also help stave off depression , insomnia and boost the immune system , the researchers claim they add that masturbation is also ' the most convenient method for maximising orgasms ' - and that people who orgasm regularly have ' reduced stress , reduced blood pressure , increased self - esteem , and reduced pain '			1
last , but not least , they make the point that there 's also no risk of disappointing a partner - of the dreaded performance anxiety			0
and there 's no risk of unwanted pregnancies or @entity109 .			0

@entity80 academics say there are *numerous* benefits of self - pleasuring
can also help stave off depression , insomnia and boost the immune system
