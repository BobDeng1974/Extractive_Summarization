@entity0 is a striker who the majority of sides in the @entity3 would love to have in their midst			1
luckily for @entity7 and @entity8 it is they who can call upon the on - loan @entity11 man			1
a good job , really , given he thundered in a late equaliser on an afternoon that had it all			2
when @entity11 won promotion to the @entity18 two years ago , @entity0 was the star with 31 goals			1
the @entity8 would be foolish not to talk numbers when a chance arises to make this move permanent in january			1
if he carries on scoring — that is three in four now — there is no reason why they can not bounce back to the top tier			2
@entity0 wheels away in delight with his @entity8 team - mates after salvaging a last - gasp draw @entity0 celebrates his goal as he points up towards the @entity8 faithful - the way the @entity8 could end up going this season if they keep hold off the @entity11 man @entity38 is already indebted to him			1
the ball broke to the 31 - year - old on the edge of the box as we crept towards stoppage time and he viciously let fly to earn a point			1
‘ he ’s settled in extremely well and is forming a great partnership with @entity47 , ’ said @entity38			2
‘ we ’ve got threats in the team to go and score goals			1
’ you sense he was downplaying @entity0 ’s impact			1
the hosts had been there for the taking before @entity0 ’s late intervention , and @entity57 should be celebrating breaking into the automatic promotion places this morning			1
but @entity60 ’s side rather threw away a golden opportunity to go level with @entity63 at the summit			2
‘ we ’d love to be top but wo n’t let it bother us , ’ he said			2
@entity0 , seen here in action against @entity68 , has scored three goals in his four games for @entity8 @entity0 scored goals for fun at his level with @entity11 , and is now repeating the same form with @entity8 @entity0 celebrates winning promotion with @entity11 wanderers went ahead twice after initially falling behind , but on both occasions they surrendered their lead			1
it is games like these that may determine whether the newboys can keep pace at the top			1
the way in which they sought a fourth reveals a potential naivety @entity60 needs to eradicate quickly			2
the manager , however , was quick to reject those claims after the game			0
‘ if you drop off they can throw men forward			0
you ca n’t just defend , ’ he reasoned			0
’ these two sides hurled men forward all game			0
it was a captivating contest from start to finish and points towards clubs who have the character and quality to do some damage this season			0
positive signs for @entity8 ’s new @entity110 owners — several of whom were here at the @entity112			1
@entity113 had long gone out the window			0
wolves were dozy in not switching on to @entity117 ’s short corner with @entity118 before the latter whipped in wonderfully from the right , allowing young central defender @entity121 to steal a yard at the near post and head home			0
it was a sweet moment for the 22 - year - old , netting a first goal for the club that brought him through its academy			1
wolves , too narrow and one - paced , struggled to really get a grip on this until the break			1
just after it , @entity135 was finally afforded time to run at @entity138 on the left , drilling a cross low towards @entity141 at the back post who duly obliged			0
that sparked a stunning four minutes as the away end — heavily populated with 1,800 visiting supporters — went berserk			0
even more so three minutes after , with @entity147 calmly slotting in a second after finding himself unmarked on the penalty spot			0
but @entity150 equalised straight from the restart , slotting under @entity152 to cap off a ‘ fantastic goal ’ according to his manager			0
@entity155 was unfortunate to divert a corner into his own net with six minutes remaining , but it was left for @entity0 — dispensed with by @entity11 so they could sign @entity160 — to have the final word			1
reading defender @entity121 scored his first - ever goal for the club against @entity57 on sunday performance of the weekend @entity165 , who have enjoyed the dubious title of serious underachievers for years given the size of their catchment area , finally look as if they are ready to bounce back into the second tier			1
@entity174 ’s side are already five points clear at the top of @entity177 after beating @entity178 3 - 2 at @entity179 , thanks to a winner from stalwart @entity182 seconds after the visitors had drawn level			2
@entity165 captain @entity182 expresses his delight after scoring the winner against @entity178 on saturday what 's caught my eye @entity189 is finally having an impact on the @entity191 back four after the @entity192 held @entity193 to a goalless draw at the @entity195			0
@entity196 — who left @entity197 last week — was in the stands to watch @entity200 record their first win in six against @entity203			0
he looks primed to take over following @entity205 ’s departure			0
@entity206 marked his return to @entity208 by beating @entity209 thanks to a @entity211 strike			0
life without @entity213 is going smoothly in east @entity214 — they ’ve won four of their last five			0
@entity189 led his side to an encouraging draw at the home of championship high flyers @entity193 @entity196 watched on as @entity200 ended their winning drought against @entity203 @entity206 applauds the @entity208 faithful after beating @entity209 in his first game back in charge			2

@entity0 has already *endeared* himself to the @entity8 faithful since *joining* on loan until january from @entity18 outfit @entity11
the 31 - year - old has scored three goals in four games for the @entity8
@entity8 could maintain a strong promotion push if they manage to keep hold off @entity0 beyond the terms of his initial loan spell
