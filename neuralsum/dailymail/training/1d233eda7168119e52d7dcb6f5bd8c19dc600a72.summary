by @entity0 @entity1 gave @entity2 and @entity3 the perfect welcome to @entity5 with a 1 - 0 win over @entity7 in @entity8			1
the @entity1 are away on tour as they prepare for their return to the @entity11 , after beating @entity12 1 - 0 in the @entity14 play - off final in may , and they are doing plenty of business at home to get ready for the top flight			1
@entity2 was announced on a one - year deal on thursday evening and the Â£ 8m deal to bring @entity3 from @entity21 to @entity22 was confirmed on tuesday			2
@entity2 watched from the sidelines after doing the pre-match warm - up and the @entity1 wasted no time in showing the former @entity46 man what they can do			1
@entity48 had a goal chalked off by the linesman 's flag early on after good work from @entity54 @entity53 , who has returned to the club after an injury - ravaged loan spell at @entity57			2
however , @entity48 gave @entity1 the lead with a headed effort on 22 minutes after a quickly - taken free - kick from @entity61			1
@entity62 did well to deny @entity63 with his feet , while the @entity7 striker was thwarted by the woodwork just before the break when his header crashed against the bar			0
scrapper : @entity53 fights two @entity7 defenders for the ball wrestle : @entity29 of @entity1 and @entity73 back in action : midfielder @entity75 returning from a layoff instruction : @entity78 gives out some directions @entity80 looked like being one of a number of players deemed surplus to requirements by @entity33 after contributing little last season , but the right winger started the friendly in @entity8 and gave the former @entity91 supremo something to think about			1
free agent @entity92 , who sacrificed himself in the play - off final with a last - ditch tackle that earned him his marching orders , started the match			0
but @entity97 , who is training with the club after being released by the @entity91 , watched from the stands but remains hopeful of sorting out his future in the coming weeks			0
@entity1 boss @entity33 rang the changes at the break as he gave his squad valuable minutes in the build up to the new campaign			0
@entity106 's last - ditch tackle denied @entity107 a certain equaliser as the hosts piled forward in the second half			0
but @entity111 , who visit @entity113 on saturday , held on to keep a clean sheet and register their first unofficial win of the season .			0
