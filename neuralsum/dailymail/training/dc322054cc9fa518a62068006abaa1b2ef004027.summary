by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 27 september 2013 @entity2 : 10:49 est , 29 december 2013 in its day it was the @entity6 country retreat of former @entity8 prime minister @entity7 and her husband			1
today , in the genteel countryside of leafy @entity12 , the once - proud mansion has a rather different role – as a secret location for sex parties			1
the 15 - bedroom house – not to mention the woods and grounds – has become a favourite for swingers and couples to meet for erotica evenings , wife - swapping and naked al fresco liaisons			2
faded grandeur : @entity7 's former @entity12 home is now being used as a venue for weekend orgies @entity7 's £ 9million @entity12 mansion is secret location for £ 450 - a - couple sex parties with naked tennis and a dungeon @entity7 's £ 9million @entity12 mansion is secret location for £ 450 - a - couple sex parties with naked tennis and a dungeon where world leaders and dignitaries might once have sipped tea politely from bone china cups , men and women are invited to embrace on the sofas or cavort publicly on the lawns			1
games of naked tennis are played on the courts and there is a ‘ dungeon ’ in the cellar where guests are more likely to be found in bondage or fetish gear than in business suits or evening dress			0
the new role for @entity54 was revealed as it is being offered for sale – with a plan to say goodbye to all the hanky - panky and build an ultra-modern , £ 8.9million home in place of the forlorn - looking mansion			1
mrs @entity7 and her husband @entity61 bought the house in 1995			1
it later embroiled them in controversy amid accusations it was paid for with money from illegal kickbacks mr @entity61 received from government contracts			0
past owner : when former @entity8 president @entity7 owned the house it boasted a £ 120,000 @entity75 glass table @entity7 's £ 9million @entity12 mansion is secret location for £ 450 - a - couple sex parties with naked tennis and a dungeon mrs @entity7 ’s government was dismissed for ‘ corruption , misrule and nepotism ’			1
she was assassinated in 2007			0
the mansion in @entity86 , near @entity87 , was sold for £ 4million in 2004 and now has barely a trace of the @entity89 ’ residence there , save for some golden doorways and an ornate roof painted to resemble a night sky			1
the tenant of the house has been renting it out for sex parties , advertised only days in advance and with tickets costing up to £ 450 each			1
the most recent event , in august , was a two - day ‘ mini festival of sin ’ organised by events company @entity103			1
it was billed as ‘ a full weekend of activities and adventures for pure unadulterated hedonism			0
a walk on the wild side			0
’ the schedule of options listed naked tennis , sex in the pool , ‘ naughty walks ’ in the woods , plus open - air sex around a large bonfire , in the hot tubs or in the forest			2
@entity121 , which organised last month 's orgy , promised guests ' pure unadulterated hedonism ' ( posed by model ) yesterday the tenant , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ this is not a venue			2
‘ this is a private home , where i occasionally hold private events for a range of open - minded and wonderful people			2
‘ the majority of events that i hold here are musical events , or wonderful charity events			0
yes , there have been events of a sexual nature , but i do n’t see why that is anything for people to be ashamed about			0
‘ everything that takes place is within the law and the authorities have absolutely no concern			0
why should shame be attached to sexuality ? ‘ these are happy events – not some of the cocaine - fuelled private parties that probably take place all over the county			1
’ the house is being marketed by @entity152 as a ‘ development opportunity ’			2
projected plans suggest the new house is unlikely to have any secrets to hide			0
it appears to be made almost entirely of glass .			0
