by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 00:26 est , 14 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:06 est , 14 february 2014 @entity4 today boasted that @entity5 is the main opposition in the north of @entity8 after coming second to @entity9 in a high - profile by - election			1
the @entity11 were pushed into third place behind the eurosceptic party , with the @entity14 humiliated after losing their deposit			1
@entity16 sought to play down the significance of again being beaten by @entity5 , but mr @entity4 ailed ' really good solid , steady progress ' against the mainstream parties			2
thumb 's up : @entity4 hailed the by - election result , which saw @entity5 candidate @entity22 ( left ) come second ahead of the @entity11 , as proof his party is now the opposition in the north @entity9 ’s @entity26 comfortably held the safe seat of @entity28 and @entity29 in the early hours of this morning and become the party ’s newest mp			1
but @entity5 , who trailed in fifth place at the 2010 general election , saw their strategy of targeting @entity9 seats in the @entity36 pay off – with a @entity38 collapse and humiliation for the @entity14			1
the anti-eu party ’s candidate was @entity22 , a businessman who grew up in the area in a staunchly @entity9 household			1
he said the result showed the progress @entity5 were making , telling @entity46 : ' in the north of @entity8 we 're shaping up to be the only opposition to @entity9			1
' a @entity5 battle bus parked on a taxi rank was given a parking ticket in outside the by - election count @entity56 's former parking chief @entity55 said : ' we recommend to all people not to park in taxi ranks			1
we look forward to receive their payment ' mr @entity22 's campaign focused on concerns about immigration , the @entity65 and rising green taxes on energy bills , but leaflets also highlighted ‘ @entity9 ’s millionaires ’			1
@entity5 leader @entity4 had complained the campaign had been ' as dirty as they come '			2
@entity9 were the clear winners with 13,261 votes			2
@entity5 pulled in 4,301 compared with the @entity11 ' 3,479			1
the @entity14 candidate @entity74 managed only 1,176 and refused to talk to the media			1
the by - election was triggered by the sudden death of popular @entity9 mp @entity78 mp , who collapsed while out jogging last month , aged 60			2
@entity9 has held the seat for 17 years since it was created and the late mr @entity78 took 58 per cent of the vote at the last election , with the @entity38 in second place on 25 per cent			1
the by - election was triggered by the sudden death of popular @entity9 mp @entity78 mp , who collapsed while out jogging last month , aged 60 both the conservatives and @entity5 had thrown resources at the campaign , with treasury minister @entity88 and justice secretary @entity89 among the mps who travelled there to campaign for their contender , politically - unknown vicar @entity92 , 26			1
@entity5 's previous best result was gaining 27.8 per cent of the vote in the @entity95 last march , coming a close second to the @entity14 in the contest following the resignation of disgraced former minister @entity99			1
@entity9 won the @entity28 and @entity100 parliamentary by - election today while the @entity38 were pushed into third place by @entity5 and @entity14 support was decimated			1
former councillor @entity26 held the seat for the party , polling 13,261 votes			1
the party 's success and the demise of the @entity11 vote is yet another by - election blow to prime minister @entity16			2
but the @entity14 were dealt a humiliating blow when they polled just 1,176 votes - not enough to hold their deposit			1
the by - election was brought about by the sudden death of the serving mp , @entity78 , on january 7 , at 60			0
in his victory speech , mr @entity26 said voters had ' sent a very clear message ' to the government			2
' they have rejected the failed policies of the out - of - touch @entity11 , they have rejected the isolationism and scaremongering of @entity5			1
' it 's a result which emphatically demonstrates that people here know the @entity129 is not safe in @entity16 's hands , and that we 've had enough of his utterly out - of - touch government			2
' on the subject of vote retention , @entity4 said his party 's performance in increasing its share of the vote represented ' really good progress ' in the @entity36 and said that only the lightning timetable set for the campaign by @entity9 , and a turn out of just 28 per - cent , had prevented it doing even better			1
‘ we are picking up votes in the @entity36 , and we are getting most of them from the @entity147 , ’ the @entity5 leadersaid			2
‘ our message is this – open - door immigration has hit @entity9 voters and lower tax payers more than any other part of our society			2
‘ link that with the fact that @entity9 does not like being governed from @entity156 and that is why we are picking up votes in the @entity36			2
’ the prime minister described the @entity38 result – in which its share of the vote was almost halved to 14.5 per cent – as ‘ disappointing ’			0
but he suggested that @entity5 ’s momentum had stalled , after a number of by - elections in which the party polled more than 20 per @entity167 dismissed suggestions it was losing votes to @entity5			2
mr @entity26 said voters had ‘ rejected the failed policies of the out - of - touch @entity11 ’ , as well as the ‘ isolationism and scaremongering of @entity5 ’			1
but senior @entity9 figures acknowledge privately that @entity5 is making inroads into the working - class vote			1
‘ until recently i was encouraging people to vote @entity5 because i knew it would hurt the @entity38 , ’ said one			0
they are taking votes off us in significant numbers and , unless we promise a referendum on the @entity65 , they will continue to do so			0
’ mr @entity185 said the @entity11 should be ‘ deeply concerned ’ by the collapse of their vote at a time when the economy is showing signs of recovery			0
@entity14 president @entity192 described the party ’s performance , where it polled just 1,176 votes and lost its deposit , as ‘ very disappointing ’			1
‘ the reality is in by - elections in the past the @entity14 were often the “ @entity202 ”			0
the reality is now that we ’re one of the above , ’ he said			0
professor @entity203 , professor of politics at @entity205 @entity207 politics looks like a stalemate at the moment			0
@entity9 is ahead in the polls , but not by enough to be confident of victory in 2015			0
the @entity11 are still trying to find the favourable political wind they hope economic recovery will bring			0
the @entity14 remain in the deep black hole they have occupied ever since they supported £ 9,000 tuition fees , while after their dramatic rise in the polls earlier last year , @entity5 appear to be doing little more than treading water			1
the @entity28 result confirmed this picture			0
there was one big loser – the @entity14 – while nobody else could be wholly satisfied with their achievement			0
true , @entity9 not only won the seat but also increased its share of the vote by 11 percentage points – almost twice its average rise in all previous by - elections since 2010			2
however , at 55 per cent its share was still lower than the @entity9 vote locally in 2001			0
that does not give the impression of a party well set to grab power next year			0
the @entity38 performance was almost a mirror image of @entity9 ’s – its vote fell by 11 points			0
the drop matches almost exactly the party ’s average performance in by - elections in the past 18 months			0
there is no sign here of any recovery in @entity11 fortunes			0
eighteen months ago , @entity5 ’s 18 per cent share would have been regarded as remarkable			0
that today it might even be thought of as a bit of a disappointment – the party secured more than 20 per cent in the previous three by - elections – is testament to how far it has come in a short time			0
even so , the result is a reminder that although the party may be capable of overtaking the @entity11 in @entity9 territory , it remains a long way from being able to threaten @entity9 ’s tenure in such seats			1
the party complained that because many voters now post their ballot papers long before polling day it is more difficult for it to profit from any last - minute surge it generates			0
but that did not stop @entity5 winning the equivalent of 25 per cent of the national vote in the local elections last may and seems unlikely to obstruct whatever progress it manages to make in the @entity278 elections this coming may			0
whatever disappointment @entity4 might have felt would , however , have been nothing like the pain that @entity14 leader @entity14 must have experienced			0
the 17.4 - point drop in his party ’s vote was the biggest fall in the @entity14 or @entity14 share of the vote in any post-war by - election , just edging out the 17.2 drop it suffered up the road in @entity292 in november 2012			0
the @entity14 have been trying desperately to restore their credibility in voters ’ eyes by increasingly picking fights with their @entity11 coalition partners			1
as yet , however , there is no sign that this strategy is working – and time is beginning to run out for mr @entity14 and his colleagues .			0
