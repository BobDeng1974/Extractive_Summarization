parents in @entity1 have cause for concern , after the release of a new report which shows more teachers are arrested in their state for having sex with students than anywhere else in the nation			1
the report was compiled by @entity12 , a former chief of staff of the @entity14 @entity13 , who spent all of 2014 recording each news report of teacher sex cases in every state - finding 25 in @entity1			1
he says that while his report is not scientific , since it draws only on media reports , it shows trends in what is becoming an alarmingly wide - spread issue			1
@entity31 - 116 cases 2			1
@entity37 - 45 cases 3			1
@entity39 - 43 cases 4			1
@entity41 - 40 cases 5			1
@entity43 - 37 cases 6			1
@entity44 - 31 cases 7			2
@entity46 - 28 cases 8			2
@entity48 - 27 cases 9			2
@entity1 - 25 cases 10			2
@entity51 - 25 cases another factor that influences the data is the difference in states laws			2
in some states , like @entity58 , it 's illegal for a teacher to engage in sexual relations with a student , no matter what the student 's age			0
in other states the legislation is more lax , with relationships not being a crime if the student is over 16 , as is the law in @entity71			0
therefore , there are likely to be more reported cases of teacher - student sex cases in @entity58 than @entity71			0
six of the @entity1 teachers @entity76 has covered in 2014 : @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) were both sentenced to prison terms in 2014 for their inappropriate relationships with students			1
@entity77 worked as a health teacher at @entity83 where she had sexual contact with a two students			0
@entity78 was a high school teacher and cheerleading coach who had a sexual relationship with 14 - year - old boy who was not her student substitute teacher @entity91 ( left ) was arrested in july over claims she had sex with a 15 - year - old student			0
married math teacher @entity96 ( right ) pleaded guilty last march for a light six - month prison sentence after she was caught sending nude pictures to a boy at @entity100 @entity101 ( left ) , a married teacher and mother - of - one , was arrested in november on charges she had sex with three different students			0
@entity105 ( right ) , a substitute middle school teacher , was arrested last march for charges of raping a student			0
@entity12 and his pr team at @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity31 counted a total of 781 cases , which included teachers or school employees who were arrested , charged , convicted or sentenced for such crimes in 2014			1
while @entity1 did n't have the largest percentage of cases ( @entity31 took that prize with 116 ) , it had the most for it 's population size , making it the state with the highest rate of teacher - student sex			0
@entity124 , who was born and spent nearly four decades of his life in the state , hopes his report will help bring chance to @entity1			1
' i want my grandchildren , one of these days , to be safe in @entity1 's classrooms , ' @entity12 told @entity133			0
' i think we have to be aware that , as many great teachers as there are in @entity1 , we 've seen that there are still sexual predators in our classrooms , preying on our children			0
' he thinks that one way to combat this issue is by pushing for more uniform laws against teacher - student sex across the nation			0
' teachers have authority over children every day , so it 's very important to protect that relationship , and any teacher who abuses that authority and takes advantage of a child in the classroom , that should be considered a serious crime , ' @entity12 said .			0
