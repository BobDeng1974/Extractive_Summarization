it may have a reputation as the digital currency of choice for some unsavoury online deals , but @entity5 is about to become more mainstream			1
gamers and phone owners can use the currency to buy @entity11 titles as well as apps for devices running @entity14			1
while no official announcement has been made , @entity15 has created a webpage that explains how the currency can be used to top up a @entity15 account			1
@entity5 ( illustrated ) can be used to buy @entity11 games as well as apps for @entity14			1
while there was no official announcement , a webpage explains how the currency can be used to top up @entity15 accounts however , @entity5 can only be used to load money into a @entity15 wallet , rather than make direct payments , @entity25 noted			1
at the moment , @entity5 can be added to @entity31 - based accounts , and have to be purchased in specific amounts , such as $ 10 , $ 15 , $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 75 and $ 100			1
commenting on whether the payment option will be rolled out to the @entity35 , a @entity15 spokesman told @entity36 : ' initially , only customers with a @entity31 commerce account will be able to use the service			1
' we ’ll look to possibly expand the program in the future , but have nothing further to share at this time			0
' @entity15 is the latest large company to adopt the digital currency , which is becoming increasingly mainstream			1
customers can already use it to pay for goods via @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , among others			0
the move has been greeted enthusiastically by many @entity5 users			1
at the moment , @entity5 can only be used to load money into a @entity15 wallet , rather than make direct payments , but this means that people can buy apps for @entity14 , games for @entity11 and @entity15 software ( shown ) using the virtual currency @entity5 operates as a two - way currency which can be exchanged for dollars , and vice versa			1
the notion behind it is to facilitate cheap , anonymous transactions policed by its community of users and is built around trust rather than relying on institutions like governments or banks			0
@entity5 's status as a digital currency is debatable			1
it is entirely a digital product but is not regulated and it has a limit of 21million , which is predicted to last until 2140			0
the finite nature of @entity5 means it performs more like a commodity , such as gold			2
@entity5 first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009			2
it was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery , but is known as @entity90			0
this is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it			0
each @entity5 is a piece of computer code that has been generated through very slow computer processing , also known as ' mining '			2
users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive , give and trade coins from other users			0
@entity5 's can be bought from specialist online currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as @entity107			1
one member of @entity110 ’s bitcoin community posted : ‘ it 's getting harder and harder for people to think [ @entity5 is ] dead / dying / irrelevant / scam / illegal '			2
another said : ‘ really ace move			0
' it 's clear that under the new ceo , @entity15 has really tried to up its “ developer image ” , become a bit more indie and a bit less corporate			2
‘ but i had n't expected some senior manager at @entity15 payments to ok this one this soon , before companies like @entity125 or @entity126			2
’ @entity127 , became the company ’s ceo in february and since then , has focused on services across @entity15 ’s different platforms			0
the firm 's willingness to take embrace @entity5 - ahead of @entity125 and @entity134 - may help it shed its slow and lumbering corporate image			0
the company was a latecomer to the smartphone and tablet market , for example			0
it was reported in june that @entity134 was making a move to accept @entity5 , but this has yet to be confirmed			1
a summer update to the @entity145 hinted at the plants when it began allowing apps to accept the virtual currency			0
the policy now claims : ‘ apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions			0
’ this means @entity5 could be used for downloads or in - app purchases from the @entity161 .			0

@entity15 has not officially announced the move , but a webpage *outlines* how the currency can be used to top up a @entity15 account
@entity5 can therefore *indirectly* be used to buy games , apps and software
currency can only currently be used to buy @entity15 products in the @entity31
there is no news as to when the service will be rolled out in the @entity35
