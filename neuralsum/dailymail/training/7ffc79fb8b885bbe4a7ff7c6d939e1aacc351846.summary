by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 07:59 est , 5 february 2013 @entity2 leader @entity1 has been photographed with a smartphone beside him during a meeting – but who made it ? the mystery of what make of smartphone the ruler of one of the world 's most secretive countries favours has sparked international controversy not only among geeks but the average person in the @entity18 street			1
is it an @entity20 ? an @entity21 from @entity22 ? a @entity23 from @entity24 ? surely not a @entity25 from @entity26 , the enemy across the border ? this picture of @entity2 's @entity1 with a smartphone has triggered fevered speculation about which brand is favoured by the leader of one of the world 's most repressive nations			1
the device is to his right , next to a pile of papers , but it is not clear what make it is ' i regret to say that i do n't think @entity1 would be seen dead with a @entity25 , ' said a technician in the @entity26 capital , @entity48			1
the dark phone seen beside @entity1 's elbow as he presided over a meeting with top national security advisers last week is at such an angle that its make can not be defined			1
but experts are agreed that it is definitely a smartphone , revealing that if it does actually belong to @entity1 he is keeping up with modern technology			0
' it 's believed that the smartphone seen in the picture belongs to @entity1 , given that the device was placed right next to the documents he was looking at , ' said a @entity48 government official			2
@entity26 's @entity2 's media has given the picture – issued by @entity2 's state media – prominent coverage , along with a discussion about the possible manufacturer			2
@entity25 was 99 per cent sure it was n't one of theirs			2
' it looks more like an @entity21 model , ' said a spokesman for the company whose @entity80 phone is now outselling the @entity20			0
which one ? experts have speculated whether @entity1 was pictured with an @entity20 ( left ) or an @entity21 from @entity22			1
@entity25 was 99 per cent sure it was n't one of their own models the enemy : @entity26 technology giant @entity25 has said it is sure the smartphone is not one of their own secretive : @entity2 leader @entity1 applauds before giving s public speech during a massive celebration marking the 100th birthday of national founder @entity93 this picture from january 27 shows the @entity2 leader attending a consultative meeting with officials in the fields of state security and foreign affairs at undisclosed location in @entity2 @entity26 's intelligence agents have carefully inspected the photo and they have also concluded that the @entity22 firm was the likely manufacturer			1
so what does @entity21 have to say about the phone ? ' we are n't going to get into a discussion about the device but we do appreciate the support of all users , ' the @entity22 company said in a statement			1
it is highly unlikely @entity1 's smartphone of choice is an @entity20 - apart from the fact that the device at his side appears chunkier than an @entity20 it is doubtful he would be endorsing a product of the hated @entity123			2
@entity26 's @entity125 newspasper suggested that politics was behind the brand choice			0
' it must have been politically uncomfortable for @entity1 to use products made by the @entity123 ... and he ca n't publicly endorse the fact that the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) is more technologically advanced , ' it said , in a reference to @entity25 phones			1
apart from highly - placed officials , about one million people in @entity2 own mobile phones , which were introduced into the country in 2008 through a joint venture with the @entity140 telecom @entity139			0
however , they can only phone each other and not make international calls			0
in addition phones available to the public can not access the internet			0
but it is believed @entity1 and his close associates are able to get online to the outside world			0
' @entity1 and his family members as well as the @entity2 's political elite appear to use smartphones or other mobile phones capable of accessing the internet , ' said a @entity48 government official			0
foreign visitors entering @entity2 are now allowed to bring their mobile phones into the country , but they have to purchase a local sim card that allows them to make international calls but prevents them connecting to local people .			0

phone beside @entity1 's elbow as he presided over meeting ca n't be defined
@entity26 phone maker @entity25 said it was n't one of their own
it could be an @entity21 from @entity22 or a @entity23 from @entity24
