took it to the top : security expert @entity2 used a @entity4 glitch to post to @entity6 's wall after the site 's security team refused to heed his warnings about the vulnerability the hacker who broke into @entity6 's @entity13 to expose a security lapse will be awarded nearly $ 12,000 from an online crowdsourced campaign			1
the @entity17 campaign has raised $ 11,741 for @entity2 , of @entity18 , who claims he was forced to hack into @entity6 's page to bring attention to the security vulnerability because @entity4 had ignored his earlier warnings			1
the bug that @entity2 found allowed him to post on the @entity24 of people who were n't his @entity4 friends			1
the reward for his work was arranged by @entity29 , the chief technology officer of security firm @entity30			0
' @entity2 found a vulnerability in @entity4 and , due to miscommunication , was not awarded a bounty for his work , ' @entity29 wrote on the @entity17 campaign page			1
' let us all send a message to security researchers across the world and say that we appreciate the efforts they make for the good of everyone			0
' @entity4 has a ' @entity43 ' program that pays out at least $ 500 to hackers who bring software bugs to the company 's attention			2
but he wo n't get the usual $ 500 reward because he violated their terms of service but the company said @entity2 would not qualify for a reward because he tested the bug against another user			1
@entity69 , @entity4 's chief security officer , explained the company 's decision in a post online			1
' we will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users , ' he wrote			0
' it is never acceptable to compromise the security or privacy of other people			0
in this case , the researcher could have sent a more detailed report ( like the video he later published ) , and he could have used one of our test accounts to confirm the bug			0
' @entity2 first contacted the @entity4 security team after proving the glitch was real by writing on the wall of a friend of the @entity4 founder			1
but instead of thanking him and fixing the issue , @entity4 said it was n’t a bug			2
‘ my name is @entity2			0
i finished school with @entity100 degree in @entity101			0
i would like to report a bug in your main site ( www.facebook.com ) which i discovered it ... the bug allow @entity4 users to share links to other facebook users , i tested it on @entity110 wall and i got success post			1
’ @entity2 , whose first language is arabic , lives in @entity18 and is in no way connected with @entity6 ’s fellow @entity114			2
he hoped his ability to post to her page , nonetheless , would help prove his case to @entity4 security			2
however , instead of repairing the obvious security breach , @entity4 replied to @entity121 by saying the issue ‘ was not a bug			2
’ undeterred , @entity2 used the glitch to hack his way onto @entity6 ’s facebook page			1
‘ sorry for breaking your privacy , ’ he wrote in a since removed post to @entity6 , ‘ i had no other choice … after all the reports i sent to @entity4 team			1
’ @entity2 went on to recount his attempts to warn the website and posted a grab of the post on his blog			0
minutes later , his pleas were answered			0
@entity4 contacted him demanding to know how he ’d hacked their bosses personal page			0
‘ we fixed this bug on thursday , ’ wrote @entity142 from @entity4 ’s security team in a saturday post on @entity145			2
@entity4 has a bounty program designed to bribe hackers into reporting glitches they find rather than exploiting them			0
such validated reports are worth $ 500			0
victim ? @entity6 uses @entity4 to post about big life events , such as his marriage to @entity6 , just like everyone else			1
and like everyone else , @entity6 's account was vulnerable to the glitch @entity160 found			1
