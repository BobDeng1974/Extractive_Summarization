unusual : most police appeals involve children , the elderly or the mentally ill. @entity3 is 26 yesterday it emerged the @entity161 has classed four rape cases as ' no crime ' - so why did it pour such resources by comparison into finding the reality star ? police have to follow a strict set of guidelines laid down by the @entity291 ( @entity291 ) before they issue a public appeal and a photo			1
forces receive a huge number of calls - the vast majority of which later turn out to be false alarms			2
that means some cases have to be ' bumped up ' the priority list , especially if they include a fear for someone 's welfare , as was the case with the press release regarding @entity3			2
but officers have been criticised for using the category too readily because fewer checks are needed before making an appeal			0
the @entity291 guidelines say : ' there have been several cases where the @entity316 has been criticised for misuse of this category when the correct one should have been missing person			0
' it is poor practice to use such a category to avoid the rigours of a full missing person investigation			0
' most of the missing person appeals made by the @entity161 recently involved people who were obviously vulnerable in some way			2
of the 15 appeals the force has made in the last ten days , just three involved apparently healthy adults			0
eight involved children or teenagers and four involved the elderly , or people with autism or dementia			0
however , police are also duty - bound under the @entity339 to ' take reasonable action , within their powers , to safeguard the rights of individuals who may be at risk			0
' the guidelines add : ' failure to properly investigate a report of a missing person may leave an individual at risk and the police service vulnerable to a legal challenge under either the @entity339 or the law relating to negligence			0
officers are advised to imagine the worst in every situation			0
the motto is : ' if in doubt , think murder ' .			0
