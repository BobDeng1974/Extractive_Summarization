by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 01:54 est , 5 april 2013 scientists have discovered tectonic plates hidden deep within the @entity4 's mantle , which they say rewrite 40 years of history about the evolution of western @entity7			1
it has long been thought that @entity7 's mountainous west was formed - at a time when dinosaurs prowled the earth - by the movement of an undersea plate called @entity15 in a process similar to the way a supermarket conveyor belt moves with groceries on top			1
millions of years ago , the tectonic plate moved eastward beneath the continent , dragging islands along with it until they smashed and reformed along the west coast , forming the mountainous ridges of the wild west , scientists had previously thought			1
this @entity29 image renders the mountainous topography of the western @entity31 , and the ancient oceanic plate from the surface down to 1500 km depth ( colour changes in depth increments of 200 km ) but revising 200million years of geologic history in what has been described as a ' eureka moment ' , a research group now claims that the process involved not just one but several plates that remain hidden deep within the @entity4 's mantle			1
scientists at @entity45 in @entity46 and the @entity48 geological survey used seismic tomography , or earthquake shockwaves , to create a three - dimensional map of these massive crust plates , which are now languishing some 500 to 1,200 miles beneath the @entity4 's surface			1
the plate relics , according to lead author and geophysicist @entity55 and her colleague @entity56 , look like almost vertical walls , hundreds of feet thick			0
the authors propose that the newly named @entity61 and @entity62 plates may have existed beneath long - vanished seas			2
the geologic history of western @entity7 since the @entity66 period			1
the left shows time slices of undersea oceanic crust , and the right shows the position of geologic features based on the position of the subducted slabs the breakup of the @entity77 supercontinent which formed 300 million years ago			2
it began to break apart around 200 million years ago			2
the graphic shows how it is believed this happened they claim there were sandwiched , and overrun , by a westward - moving @entity7 plate and eastward - moving @entity86 plates , the @entity82 reports			1
@entity55 found the plates are colder and denser than the surrounding mantle rock , and that seismic waves change speed as they pass through the plates , revealing their location			1
no one had seen the plates in such detail before because it requires powerful computers and seismic monitoring equipment , both of which were only developed in the last decade			2
the study was published in the journal nature , on wednesday , @entity101 reports			0
' the largest wall runs from northwest @entity106 to the eastern @entity31 and on to @entity107 , and has been called the @entity86 , one of the most massive features in global tomographies , ' authors wrote			0
' we argue that in fact most of this slab wall is not @entity86 and subdivide it into the @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity15 components			0
' @entity56 told live science : ' it will take a while to turn people around			0
that intellectual ship has a lot of inertia ... this is one of those eureka moments			0
' the authors have said a further study was needed to understand the whole of the ' jigsaw puzzle '			0
' poorly understood , such collisions are of broad scientific interest ' authors wrote			0
' they cause rapid geographic changes , affecting climate , ocean circulation , biota and the formation of economically important mineral deposits			0
' the old @entity139 story begins 200 million years ago , just before the @entity141 basin first opened			2
@entity7 was crammed into the @entity77 supercontinent and the vast @entity143 covered the rest of the @entity146 's ocean floor has almost completely disappeared under @entity7 as @entity4 's tectonic plates have shifted. , so its history is somewhat cryptic			1
a few geologic clues led scientists to the prevailing model , contested by the new study			2
the puzzle pieces include the few remaining bits of @entity157 , rocks scattered along western @entity7 , and remnants of the old oceanic crust seen under the continent , where the plate disappeared into the mantle , the layer of @entity4 beneath the @entity154 started shifting to the west 185 million years ago , away from @entity165 and @entity166 , the prevailing model placed a subduction zone along the @entity169 that consumed @entity143 's huge oceanic tectonic plate , the @entity86			1
imagine a setting like today 's andes in @entity173			2
like a giant conveyor belt , the subduction zone delivered exotic terranes that built out the western @entity178 for some scientists , the puzzle pieces just did n't fit this picture			1
@entity55 and @entity56 think they know @entity182 looked deep into the mantle , at the remnants of oceanic crust that remain beneath @entity7			1
in a subduction zone , two of @entity4 's tectonic plates collide and one slides into the mantle			1
the plates are colder and denser than the surrounding mantle rock			1
seismic waves change their speed as they pass through the plates , revealing their location			2
no one had seen these old pieces of crust in this detail before because it requires powerful computers and very dense arrays of seismic monitoring equipment , both of which came about in the last @entity205 discovered a vertical pile of oceanic crust segments stacked on top of one another like bricks			2
the massive wall runs from northwest @entity106 to @entity107 , and is 250 to 375 miles wide ( 400 to 600 kilometers ) and extends from between 500 to 1,200 miles ( 800 to 2,000 km ) beneath the surface			0
these former slabs , as geologists call subducted crust , fix the position of @entity143 's ancient subduction zones in time and space , the study shows			0
the slabs sunk vertically about 0.4 inches ( 1 centimeter ) per year and have not shifted in space			0
because geologists know the travels of @entity7 in detail , thanks to magnetic stripes in the @entity141 , the researchers can pull back the continent and compare it to the position of subducted crust			1
" what this does is provide us with a time machine			0
the slabs are telling us the sites of past ocean trenches and the locality of island arcs , which are the building blocks of continents , " said @entity56 , a geologist with the @entity48 geological survey in @entity236 new plateswhat the mantle evidence shows is that as @entity77 broke up , out in the @entity143 , a vast archipelago sat far offshore of @entity7			1
it was shaped like an arrowhead , 6,200 miles ( 10,000 km ) long , with its tip pointing to the proto - @entity249			0
two ocean basins sat between the archipelago and @entity7 , called the @entity61 and the @entity62			2
on the other side of the archipelago , further to the west , was the @entity256 of an @entity258 - style subduction zone , with the @entity86 sliding to the east under @entity7 , there was a westward - dipping subduction zone , with @entity7 crust sliding beneath the @entity262 and @entity62 plates.western north america geologic @entity263 a millionare in the @entity266 following our successful trades ! ! ! ! @entity269 it ] the geologic history of western @entity7 since the @entity66 , based on subducted oceanic crust			1
the left shows time slices of subducted oceanic crust , and the right shows an intepretation of the position of geologic features based on the position of the subducted @entity279 : @entity281 full size image " it makes perfect sense , " said @entity282 , a geologist at the @entity283 , who was not involved in the study			0
" if there was eastward subduction , as most people would suggest , it would leave a bread crumb trail strewn out across the mantle			0
that 's not what you see			0
" as @entity7 plowed westward , with its margin sinking the two plates , it rammed into the arrow point about 150 million years ago			1
this impact was responsible for raising the initial @entity305 , @entity307 west of the archipelago , the @entity15 ocean plate was descending into its own subduction zone , the mantle evidence @entity302 fact , the entire western @entity143 was more like the @entity310 , where northeast @entity311 collides with islands , microcontinents disappear into the @entity4 , and there are flip - flopping subduction zones , the study authors said			1
" the ocean basin was not a vast abyssal plain , " @entity56 told @entity316			0
" the situation is much more like the @entity310 than offshore @entity173			0
" [ @entity4 's @entity322 ] over time , collisions with the different subduction zones smeared exotic terranes along the continent 's western margin , a rock record that has long hinted at @entity7 's violent tectonic history			1
the history revealed by the mantle slabs helps explain some baffling geology , such as rocks carried 1,200 miles ( 2,000 km ) from @entity332 to @entity106			2
" i would say that this model comes very close to fitting the geology , " @entity282 said.earthquakes , u.s. earthquakes , united states earthquakes , subduction zone earthquakes , earthquake hazards , cascadia fault , cascadia subduction zone , cascadia earthquakes and tsunamis , earthquake monitors , monitoring earthquakes , seismology and geophysics [ pin it ] a cross-section of a portion of the @entity352 subduction @entity350 : @entity355 full size @entity353 also found another , more westerly slab wall connected to the @entity352 trench off @entity358 and @entity359 , into which the last remnant of the @entity86 , now called the @entity361 , is @entity362 said the new model will make waves , as it overturns 40 years of accepted wisdom about the evolution of western @entity7			1
" it will take a while to turn people around			0
that intellectual ship has a lot of inertia , " he said			0
but for @entity56 , " this is one of those eureka moments			0

scientists discovered tectonic plates hidden deep within @entity4 's mantle
