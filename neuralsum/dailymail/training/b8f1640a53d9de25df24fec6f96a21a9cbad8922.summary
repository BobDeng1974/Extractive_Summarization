the simple exercise of sitting down and standing up again without holding onto anything , could suggest how long you have to live			0
this is the belief of a group of physicians , who came up with the ‘ sitting - rising test ’ to measure their patients ’ flexibility and strength			1
they developed a scoring system for the test and found that people who scored three points or less out of 10 , were more than five times as likely to die within six years , as those who scored more than eight points			1
this diagram shows how to take the ' sitting rising test ' @entity23 , of @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , was among the doctors who originally developed the sitting rising test ( @entity29 ) to quickly assess the flexibility of athletes , but he now uses it to persuade his patients that they need to stay active to maintain their muscle and balance , and live longer , @entity36 reported			1
as we age , our muscles tend to become weaker and a loss of balance means we are increasingly likely to fall			0
current ways to test frailty can be time - consuming , impractical and inaccurate for small doctors ’ surgeries , but experts are keen to keep older people moving			2
dr @entity23 says that anyone can take the @entity29 because no equipment is needed			2
a video explaining how the sitting standing test works , although caution should be exercised if you give it a try as we age , our muscles tend to become weaker and a loss of balance means we are increasingly likely to fall			0
doctors are keen for older people to keep exercising - a stock image of a class in @entity58 is pictured in a study , published in the @entity61 , the researchers described how 2002 adults aged between 51 and 80 took the @entity29 at @entity63 in @entity25			1
they found that patients who scored fewer than eight points out of 10 on the test , were twice as likely to die within the next six years , compared with people with more perfect scores			1
one point was deducted each time a person used their hand or knee for support to either sit down or stand up , while half a point was deducted for losing their balance			1
the experts found that people who scored three points or fewer , were more than five times as likely to die within the same period			1
they wrote in the study : ‘ musculoskeletal fitness , as assessed by @entity29 , was a significant predictor of mortality in 51 – 80 - year - old subjects			1
’ the study found that every point increase in the test , was linked to a 21 per cent decrease in mortality from all causes			2
however , chartered physio - therapist @entity92 said that the exercise may be ' quite ambitious ' for older people in the @entity95			0
this is possibly because of cultural differences , because @entity95 are not used to regularly sitting on the floor , like in some other cultures			0
in this way , it may not be terribly accurate at predicting life expectancy			0
she told @entity104 that there is a risk that people with early signs of arthritis in the knee could feel the strain when trying the exercise , which she described as ' quite hard work '			0
' the advice is not to endorse the test – it sounds as if it is somewhat simplistic and it is not widely used , ' she said			0
@entity95 physiotherapists tend to prefer another test , where patients stand up from a sitting position and see how many times they can repeat the action in 30 seconds			2
' the " 30 second chair test " is more appropriate and is used as a prognostic , ' she said			0
' it 's simplistic , quick and easy and gives a good indicator for falls			0
' the test measures leg strength and endurance - which are needed to move around without falling - rather than flexibility and agility like the @entity29			1
healthy people aged between 60 and 64 are expected to stand and sit more than 12 times for women and 14 times for men in 30 seconds			2
a good score for a 90 to 94 - year - old is siting and standing more than seven times for man and four times for women			1
while ms @entity143 did not recommend the @entity29 , she said it does ' address everything ' in terms of a person 's strength and flexibility .			0

physicians in @entity26 developed the test to measure flexibility quickly
no equipment is needed to sit and stand without any support
people can score a *maximum* of 10 points , with 1 point deducted for putting a hand or leg for *stability* , and half a point docked for *wobbling*
patients who scored fewer than eight points , were twice as likely to die within the next six years , compared with people with more perfect scores
study claims that musculoskeletal fitness , as assessed by the simple test , can be used to predict death in 51 – 80 - year - olds
