a police spy passed on confidential details about the breakdown of @entity3 and @entity5 ’s marriage to @entity7 bosses			1
the undercover officer sent reports of how the couple ‘ had , in reality , separated ’ during the @entity13 inquiry into their son @entity14 ’s racist murder			1
in one , he made it clear that the collapse of the couple ’s marriage ‘ is not public knowledge ’			2
details of the astonishing intrusion of privacy are contained in the @entity26 review into the @entity28 case			1
they have mocked everything we have done , telling us to our faces that they are listening and things will change , and all the time laughing behind our backs			0
‘ i think they are actually worse than criminals , because these officers get paid with taxpayers ’ money for what they do			2
’ the extraordinary revelations of the invasion of the @entity56 ’ privacy by an officer attached to @entity7 ’s disgraced @entity59 – an ultra-secret wing of @entity61 – came as : the incredible scrutiny placed on the private life of the @entity64 is buried in the 100 - page @entity26 report into the @entity28 case			1
according to the @entity26 review , undercover @entity59 officer @entity67 sent his police bosses a series of reports detailing private information back to his police bosses			1
the revelations were made in the @entity26 review into the case it is not clear who read the spy ’s reports but a number of very senior former @entity84 officers are set to be quizzed over the privacy breach at the forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing			1
in one report , in july 1998 , @entity67 wrote ‘ the main problem facing the [ @entity28 ] campaign was the refusal of both @entity3 and @entity5 to have anything other to do with other groups ... that they had in reality separated and that they only continued together as a front for the campaign			1
’ in another , he said : ‘ as for the @entity28 family , @entity5 and @entity35 split up during the first stage of the inquiry ( although this is not public knowledge )			1
@entity3 remains the more politicised of the two although @entity5 has recently been vocal in her calls for the commissioner to resign			1
’ he also claims he was informed that ‘ my reporting was going straight to [ then @entity84 commissioner ] sir @entity111 ’s desk each morning ’			2
last night a shocked mr @entity28 said : ‘ what in heaven ’s name has the stage of my marriage got to do with @entity14 ’s murder ? did they think that @entity5 and i had fallen out , and that one of us had decided to have our son murdered to spite the other ? that ’s the only reason i can think of for them taking the slightest interest in our relationship			1
it makes me think that the police officers running the investigation must have taken leave of their senses			0
‘ from the day i first came to this country more than 50 years ago , i have never been in trouble with the law			0
since @entity14 ’s murder i have gone out of my way to help the police			0
now i do n’t even want to talk to them again			0
’ mr @entity28 said it was deeply ironic that the @entity84 were interested in the breakdown of his marriage , because it might have survived but for the failed murder investigation			1
‘ there was really nothing wrong with our marriage , ’ he said			2
‘ it was six years after the murder that the divorce took place			0
our marriage broke down slowly , over a long drawn - out period directly due to problems with the case , fighting for justice , and our frustration and anger – and that was all down to the way it was handled by then police			2
incredulous : @entity5 and @entity35 , pictured in 1998			0
mr @entity28 said he ' sat down and cried ' when he heard of the report 's contents ‘ so you have a situation where this police spy in our camp was reporting back on a situation the police had created			1
the marriage probably would n’t have collapsed if it was n’t for them			0
’ mr @entity28 ‘ sat down and cried ’ yesterday , when he heard of the report ’s contents at the @entity175 office of his solicitor			1
‘ it was the deceit that really got to me , ’ he said			0
‘ and it just hit me that the police had destroyed my life , and the lives of my family			2
’ police minister @entity183 told @entity184 he understood why the @entity28 family had lost faith in the police			1
‘ they went through a terrible , unimaginable ordeal 20 years ago and ... they are still going through it because we ’ve not got to the truth yet , ’ he said			0
the heroic work of undercover officers who risk their lives on dangerous assignments should not be over-shadowed by the @entity28 ‘ spying ’ scandal , a former detective said yesterday			1
an undercover officer – codenamed @entity67 – spied on the @entity28 family while working for @entity7 ’s @entity59 ( @entity59 ) in the late 1990s			1
but just a few years later , an undercover officer working for a different @entity7 unit was bought a house as part of an extraordinary ‘ sting ’ operation to infiltrate the @entity28 murder gang			1
using a false identity , the officer moved into a property close to one of the prime suspects and tried to befriend him			0
the long - term aim of the mission – carried out amid enormous secrecy – was to try to obtain a murder confession			0
the operation highlighted the risks taken by detectives in their bid to gain justice for @entity14			0
up to 20 officers were on standby in case their undercover colleague ’s cover was blown and his life put at risk			0
ultimately , the operation failed to obtain new leads			0
but former met det sgt @entity230 , who once worked in @entity61 , told the @entity231 : ‘ critics of @entity59 undercover officers seem to be unaware that another undercover @entity84 officer literally risked his life by attempting to befriend @entity14 ’s killers by virtue of living in a house close to one of the suspects			2
‘ even before @entity14 ’s tragic death , racial tensions were high and @entity61 monitored neo-nazi groups in the same way that they did those on the @entity245 and their efforts unquestionably saved lives			0
despite mistakes that were made , most @entity59 officers were brave , committed and dedicated			0
now retired , those same officers are apprehensive at the current furore and concerned that being the subject of any inquiry may endanger both themselves and their families			0
’ mr @entity230 , now a commentator on police issues , added : ‘ the current furore will do little to lift the ever - growing black cloud that threatens a police service , which , for all its imperfections , is still the best and most restrained in the world			2
