an ultra-rare classic @entity0 designed for the race track has been sold for a price believed to be more than £ 5million			1
just 12 of the @entity4 were ever made , and of those only 11 are still in existence - meaning they are almost never up for sale on the open market			1
they were designed as stripped - down racing versions of the popular sports car , and were used on well - known tracks against competitors such as the @entity15			1
classic car dealership @entity28 , based in @entity30 , west @entity31 , has now sold two of the rare vehicles within the past year			1
dealer @entity34 refused to reveal exactly how much the buyer paid , but it is believed to be between £ 4 - 7million			1
that price tag , prompted by the extreme rarity and historical importance of the car , is 100 times more expensive than a brand new @entity42 would cost today			0
speedy : the car , pictured being driven on a circuit , had a top speed of 150mph in its heyday classic : because of the rarity of the car , it almost never comes up for sale on the open market year of construction : 1963 top speed : 150mph engine size : 3.8 litres engine power : 360 bhp weight : 1,009kg ( 2,224lbs ) ' this model was raced by @entity22 in period and is highly original , ' mr @entity34 said after the sale			1
' @entity22 was one of the great privateers			2
' he bought the car from @entity0 and ran it himself , racing in @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
this car probably did more racing in period than any other e-type			2
' when it was raced at @entity25 , you would expect it to be getting up to more than 150mph			0
it was a very quick car , using cutting edge technology in the 1960s			0
' the @entity72 had recently been restored by @entity73 , the son of @entity22 's own mechanic			0
heyday : the @entity72 being driven on the racing track at @entity25 in 1964 new generation : this is one of the rebuilt @entity4 being built by @entity0 in @entity79 mr @entity34 added : ' i am very familiar with @entity4 and this is a car i have been after for a number of years			1
' it is the second one we have sold in the past year			0
to sell one in a decade is good , but to sell two in a year is quite something			0
' the sale comes as @entity0 continues to work on a new generation of @entity4 , using modern technology to replicate the original cars exactly			1
the carmaker , which is owned by @entity94 's @entity93 but headquartered in @entity79 , is set to produce six of the throwback models			0
they are being built by @entity96 , part of the company 's new @entity98 , at @entity100 - the original home of the e-type			2
the vehicles will cost £ 1million each , but because they are made for racing they will not be road legal .			2

the cars were designed for racing and were stripped - down versions of the original e-type
this model was built in 1963 owned by driver @entity22
