' they were going at speed			0
i told them to ease off because they were coming through a mooring and the skipper said " just testing " because they had done some repairs to the engine and were giving it a trial run			0
' he did slow down and went through nice and slow and i remember saying : " you wait until he gets to the bend			2
he ’ll open her up - and he did			0
' unfortunately , i think they were to one side and they were thrown out			0
' he said throttling up while turning into a strong current would have been like turning into a brick wall			2

he said : ' it was just a little speedboat , about 12ft			0
i think if went over because they were all sitting on one edge and the river ’s been running really strongly lately			0
' i did n’t take much notice when they went past because so many people go above the speed limit because it ’s just four knots here			0
' it happens because people get big engines and they want to see how fast the boat can go			2
' he said the first he knew something was wrong was when he heard shouting and looked over to see an upturned hull			0

mr @entity118 was one of several people to comment on the fact that the trio were not properly kitted out			0
' if they had been wearing life jackets the guy would still be alive			1
i think it should be mandatory			0
' dog walker @entity176 , 38 , from @entity22 , was at the scene minutes after the accident			1
