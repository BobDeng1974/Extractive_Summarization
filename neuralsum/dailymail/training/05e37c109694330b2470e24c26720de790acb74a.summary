by @entity1 reporter published : 20:26 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 11 june 2013 for those of us who would never dream of going to music festivals , the attraction of dodgy sound systems and fields turned into mud baths has always been a bit of a mystery			1
the secret behind the success of many summer festivals is that they ’re not really about music			1
fans are now more likely to go to a festival to take drugs , get drunk or sleep with a stranger than actually listen to the music , a study found			1
a quarter say they have slept with a stranger , 21 per cent taken drugs , and 13 per cent got into a fight			1
survey : only 45 % of those who attend festivals such as @entity28 , pictured , actually go for the music and the misbehaviour crosses the generations			1
among middle - aged ( 45 to 54 ) fans , nine per cent admit experimenting with illegal drugs at a festival , a fifth drink to excess , 10 per cent have slept with a stranger , and two per cent got into a fight , according to the study by @entity41			1
others even admit burning tents			2
brits will spend an average of £ 423.01 at @entity47 festivals this year , making them too expensive for 60 per cent of 18 to 24 - year - olds			1
however , despite @entity49 headlining @entity28 and @entity50 the @entity51 , just 45 per cent actually go for the music			1
the others are lured by the atmosphere , the chance to socialise with friends , and to ' escape from everyday life '			2
in total , 47 per cent have done things at a festival they would ' never consider doing outside of the music festival environment ' , the study found			1
for those aged 35 to 44 , the figure is 50 per cent			2
festivals expert @entity66 , professor of cultural studies at @entity68 , said it was ' human nature ' to let your inhibitions go at a festival			1
he said : ' festivals are deeply rooted in the carnival tradition , which is to invert everyday expectations of normal behaviour			2
different reasons : other festival - goers say they go to events like @entity28 , pictured from the @entity82 area of the festival site on @entity84 , @entity85 , to ' escape from everyday life ' ' historically , carnivals would have a ‘ lord of misrule ’ who oversaw the revelries and subversion of the ordinary rules of life			1
' for example , at the medieval @entity95 , a ‘ @entity96 ’ would lead a temporary revolution interlaced with hedonistic partying			0
' this carnival attitude can be seen in the earliest popular music festivals in @entity102 , such as the @entity103 in 1960			1
that ended up in a riot between modern and trad jazz fans			0
' the @entity107 of the 1980s also degenerated into trouble			0
' the @entity41 research shows that misbehaving modern festival goers are simply upholding this ancient tradition			0
' professor @entity66 added : ' the pop festival has been around for more than half a century			0
that means there are now several generations of keen festival - goers			0
' remember that venerable hippie slogan from the 1970s : " you ’re never too old for a happy childhood " ? ' music festivals continue to be places where we can escape reality and subvert the rules - whatever age we happen to be			1
' typical @entity102 weather : one in eight festival - goers say they are staying away from events held in fields this year because of fears it will ran the entire time while escaping reality for a few days can be fun , it can also have its irritations			0
the biggest gripe is that portaloos are not cleaned often enough , with 43 per cent infuriated by this , the poll of 2,000 festival - goers found			0
almost one in five ( 17 per cent ) are irked by the high price of food and drink , and 16 per cent say they have to queue too long to buy it			0
a similar number ( 17 per cent ) get frustrated at not being able to charge their mobile phone or get a signal			0
one in eight festival fans say they are staying away from the fields this year because of fears over the weather			0
and of those that are going , a pair of wellies tops their list of essential items , followed by wet wipes , fancy dress and clean underwear			0
office worker @entity163 , from @entity164 , said the ' free - spirit ' nature of festivals make them the perfect place to forget about the stresses of work			2
the 41 - year - old said : ' festivals are the perfect place to let your hair down without anyone judging you			2
i have a responsible my day job , so usually moderation and professionalism are key			0
' once i have pitched my tent i can really relax , let off a bit of steam and share the love			0
the good music is a bonus			2

only 45 % attend festivals such as @entity28 or @entity188 for the music
a quarter have slept with a stranger , 21 % took drugs , and 13 % got in a fight
