published : 14:12 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 2 april 2013 after a string of horse deaths over the last ten years , this week 's @entity0 will now be run over new plastic fences in the hope of making the course less dangerous			1
last year joint favourite @entity6 and outsider according to @entity9 had to be put down after falling at the sixth fence of the @entity0 , the infamous @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13			1
the deaths led to public outcry and calls from animal welfare groups for the @entity0 to be banned			1
the most important change will be the fences , which have seen many dangerous falls in the past			1
@entity26 managing director @entity35 said : ‘ the fences will look the same			2
the idea is to make the core softer			1
' when the spruce is knocked off , the wooden core may possibly have contributed to injury			2
' the fences will remain the same height so this year 's race should be safer but not any easier			1
horse - friendly : the more forgiving plastic frame in place for this year 's @entity0 softer : @entity26 's managing director conceded that the old wooden core may ' possibly have contributed to injury ' the timber frame has been replaced by a plastic core covered with birch			1
over the top will be a minimum of fourteen inches of spruce and horses can knock off the spruce without injuring themselves			0
@entity59 , an equine consultant for the @entity60 , praised the changes			0
' the old fences were unique to @entity26 , ' he said			0
' they were completely solid and four or five wooden posts deep			0
he explained : ' if a horse hit them , it would be catapulted into almost a somersault			0
i pushed very hard to have them taken away			0
fatal : synchronized , ridden by @entity71 , fell at @entity11 in 2012 the chief executive of the @entity60 , @entity72 , claims the death of @entity75 winner @entity6 prompted many people in racing to do a bit of ' soul searching '			0
@entity72 said : ' the @entity0 is on trial			2
i simply do n't think the public will tolerate another @entity0 like the ones we 've had the last few years			2
' ' to many inside the racing industry , the death of @entity6 was a final moment to say , ' it has got to change ''			0
one of the more controversial changes is moving the start 90 yards forward so that the horses will not be so worked up when they start			0
the noisy grandstand can agitate some horses , causing them to bolt out from the start to the first fence			2
the new fences are in place ready for this year ’s race on april 6 .			1

fence change for this year 's race after *accusations* of animal *cruelty*
in 2012 two horses had to be put down after falling over the old fences
the plastic core of the fences will be softer and safer than the birch
this year 's @entity0 will be on *saturday*
