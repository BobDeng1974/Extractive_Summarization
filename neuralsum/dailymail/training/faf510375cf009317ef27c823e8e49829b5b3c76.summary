the fastest way to update your look for @entity3 is with a slick of lipstick — and vibrant colours are in fashion right now			1
they ’ve been all over the catwalks and sales are at an all - time high , doubling in the past month			1
but there is a fine line between alluring vamp and tragedy queen			1
@entity33 has been named ‘ the new red ’ by a glossy fashion magazine , so this shade could not be more on - trend			1
the colour looked frighteningly dark on the stick , but the berry shade that emerged when on my lips was a wonderfully flattering tone			1
i ’m not certain , however , that it ’s splashy enough for @entity45			1
3/5 @entity46 and out @entity48 , @entity49 , £ 8 , @entity50 beauty bloggers rate this colour as the pick of the season			1
well , they ’re welcome to this one			1
the dark brown shade made my lips look like a giant blood blister			1
i ’d sum it up as hideous , but it was less attractive than that			1
not even a bit sexy			2
i would n’t go near this			2
and the quality is n’t great either : the pigment is blotchy			2
0/5 @entity66 @entity67 in @entity68 , £ 10 , @entity67 no doubt about it , this is an out - and - out orange			2
not even a burnt orange or autumnal shade , but a vibrant , summer orange — and that ’s the problem			2
even though i loved the colour in its casing , this is a holiday shade and goes best with a deep tan			0
it does n’t feel a natural choice for the party season			0
like every stronger colour , this one needs a lipliner or the colour will bleed			0
it has a lovely velvety texture , but it ’s not for this time of year			0
2/5 the new nude @entity90 in @entity91 , £ 7.99 , @entity92 everyone remembers the cakey nude lipsticks of the @entity95 , but today ’s promise a much more subtle effect			0
examining this before application , it seemed distinctly mauve , but on the lips it came out on the blush side of nude , a pretty shade a touch stronger than natural			0
you ’ll need a blusher with this lipstick to lift the colour			1
4/5 @entity109 @entity110 , @entity111 , £ 3.99 , boots never in a million years would i go near this kind of shocking pink			0
to my mind , there is a reason that the price is so low — this shade screams ‘ cheap ’ , particularly for those of us not in the first bloom of youth			0
but it does n’t form a block of colour			0
it ’s translucent , like a tinted lip shine , which is surprisingly flattering			0
it ’s better applied with a lip brush , as the wand which comes with it is n’t too precise			0
however , within ten minutes the colour was fading and needed topping up			0
