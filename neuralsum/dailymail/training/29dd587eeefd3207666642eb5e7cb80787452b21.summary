for @entity1 , the best phone call of saturday night was one he made to his dad @entity2			1
not because he could tell him how his @entity5 team had ended @entity7 ’s unbeaten record			1
but because he could make it at all			2
@entity1 had spent the last international break at the hospital bedside in @entity11 where @entity2 , @entity13 ’s swashbuckling left back in the 1970 @entity14 , was in intensive care following a life - or - death bowel cancer operation			1
it was a personal trauma he had done his best to keep to himself while handling the problems of helping the @entity20 ’s youngest team to recover from a 5 - 0 @entity21 hammering at @entity22			1
@entity1 saw his @entity5 side beat @entity7 to end their unbeaten run in @entity25 @entity26 scored the only goal of the game in the 78th minute at the @entity29 @entity1 had been in @entity11 with his father but on saturday night the 45 - year - old could enjoy calling to share the details of a successful day and how his side , with an average age of 21 and three quarters , had moved into @entity25 ’s automatic promotion places			1
they had some help when @entity7 captain @entity38 got sent off after barely three minutes , but then passed the ball relentlessly to exploit their extra man before striker @entity26 ( right ) finally picked his way through a packed defence to get the winner 12 minutes from time			1
‘ i could n’t wait to speak to dad , ’ admitted @entity1			1
‘ he ’s back home and just about on a level now where he can focus and talk			0
he was in intensive care for 10 days and has had that many drugs			0
‘ it was fortunate that when he was at his most critical it was the international break			0
we had three players called up then , so we had the weekend off and i managed to get out there for four days			0
‘ the doctors said it was touch and go			0
i had to get there			0
he was in intensive care the whole time , it was n’t nice			0
‘ thankfully they say the operations have been successful and he ’s clear now and will keep recovering			0
he loves @entity7 and has such fond memories of his time there — as i do because that ’s where i started as a player — but for once he ’s probably happy they ’ve been beaten			2
’ when the fixtures came out , this was the first his father had booked flights for from his @entity76 home , where he was based as @entity79 ’s chief @entity78 scout			0
@entity1 ’s own playing career was far less stellar than his old man , who was a stalwart in @entity84 ’s all - conquering @entity83 teams of the 1960s — but after scrapping through @entity87 jobs at @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 he ’s fallen on his feet			1
@entity1 's dad @entity2 was in intensive care after a make - or - break bowel cancer operation @entity5 is a club where chairman @entity98 , himself an ex-player , is building a strategy based on youth and a belief in passing football			1
the budget is a measly £ 1.5million a year , a fraction of that spent by @entity25 leaders @entity7			1
but the faith in youth is both developing their own kids and making the club a favoured destination for @entity114 sides to send their young talent on loan			0
last season some of @entity118 ’s best youngsters , including @entity119 , progressed at the @entity29			2
this time @entity79 ’s impressive @entity13 defender @entity120 , just 20 , looked the pick of the potential			0
@entity123 ( right ) in action for @entity13 against @entity126 's @entity125 during the 1970 @entity14 in @entity127 ‘ the chairman has been brilliant			2
he ’s an ex-player so he understands , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ he put this club on a sound financial footing and insisted that we try and play real good football			0
he wants to do that so we can bring young players through			0
’ @entity1 knows it will take a miracle to keep his young side in the promotion hunt			2
it ’s a long season and a trip to @entity142 next week will be a more immediate challenge			0
but on saturday night he could enjoy a small success			0
and more important , so could his dad			2
performance of the weekend @entity147 have taken time to adjust to @entity25 since promotion through the play - offs in 2013 — but clicked to end @entity152 ’s unbeaten run at @entity153 which went back to december			1
they dominated after leading through @entity157 ’s first - half header — and even when @entity158 scrambled an equaliser five minutes from time , it took just 60 seconds for @entity161 to curl in a 20 - yard winner			2
@entity147 ended @entity152 's unbeaten run at @entity153 which had stretched back to december with a 2 - 1 win what 's caught my eye ... more like what my eye could n’t see — more than 117,000 people watched the 19 games in @entity25 and two on saturday , yet the @entity171 do n’t think it ’s worth running @entity173 on international weekends			1
@entity175 had not played @entity177 football since walking out of @entity178 in 2007			0
that ’s until @entity180 gave him a shot — and the 33 - year - old got his fourth goal in five in a 1 - 0 win over @entity185			1
@entity175 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity180 against @entity185 @entity187 earned top marks for commitment — catching a 5am flight from @entity191 to keep a clean sheet in @entity194 ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity195 , just 17 hours after playing for @entity196			1
@entity187 played in @entity196 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity198 in @entity191 on friday @entity187 was back in action for @entity194 just 17 hours later , helping them to a 1 - 0 win at @entity195			1

@entity5 beat @entity7 1 - 0 in the @entity204 derby
@entity26 scored the winning goal in 78th minute at @entity29
@entity1 's side ended @entity7 's 22 - match unbeaten run in @entity25
@entity1 had been at hospital bedside of his dad in @entity11 after he *underwent* life - or - death bowel cancer operation
