' the @entity58 has urged motorists to remain vigilant ahead , while councils have stockpiled 1.3million tons of road salt and have hundreds of gritters on standby			1

the government said the money was in addition to the £ 2billion being spent on flooding and coastal erosion this spending period up to 2015 , more than one billion pounds of which is for capital projects such as flood defences			2
