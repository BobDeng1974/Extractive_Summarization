' inspiration : the sculpture was based on this sketch drawn by @entity23 , aged ten , from @entity63 talented : the schoolboy 's intricate and poignant sketch won a competition to be used as the design for the sculpture at the @entity16 in @entity17 remembering the dead : the @entity5 lays a wreath at the base of the memorial visit : @entity66 chairman @entity65 revealed that he recently visited the site of the @entity8 truce remembrance : the @entity5 left a handwritten note along with his wreath of poppies ' as president of @entity66 and @entity286 , i am delighted to be here today , and to welcome you all to the unveiling of this magnificent new @entity80 memorial			1

we all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms to meet in no - man ’s land on christmas day 1914 – when gunfire remarkably gave way to gifts			2
it remains wholly relevant today , as a message of hope and humanity , even in the bleakest of times			1
@entity52 , then as now , had the power to bring people together and break down barriers			0
in getting to this point 100 years on , i must pay tribute to the @entity250 for their work in creating a superb education resource which went out to more than 30,000 schools across the country			0

next wednesday , the @entity120 will take on the @entity121 in a special football match , which promises to be truly poignant as serving soldiers repeat this remarkable occasion 100 years on			1
yet for all the undoubted power of these activities , it was felt - this year - that the @entity80 also story needed a permanent focal point : a place for people to pay their respects			0
so , to today ’s ceremony and the creation of a lasting monument here at the @entity16			0
i was personally delighted to join @entity26 in judging a design competition involving schools from across the country			0
we were both impressed with the creativity and thought put in by so many talented young people			0
ultimately , though , we were left with a stand - out winner			0
@entity23 from @entity356 in @entity63 captured the very essence of the @entity80 with his stunning design			1
i know his family , friends , teachers and class - mates joining us today are extremely proud			0
it is vital that , 100 years on , we keep the @entity80 story alive – that moment captured so beautifully by @entity70 when hands that had held weapons came together in peaceful greeting			0
