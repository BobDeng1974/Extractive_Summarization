@entity0 , becoming sir @entity2 ’s successor at the @entity3 in 1997 , was about to discover his three - year reign in @entity5 would be unforgiving			1
‘ i have achieved more with @entity6 in six years than @entity7 have in one hundred years , ’ he announced			1
the @entity7 press constantly questioned him , such as how can you drop a @entity11 genius and 1999 @entity13 winner ? ‘ saying i broke my pact with @entity15 ? i never broke my pact			1
always negative , ’ he replied , met by laughter in the press room			1
then , in 2000 , arrived the parting shot			2
‘ friends of the media			2
congratulations , ’ he uttered , despite having won @entity21 twice and @entity22			2
@entity27 manager @entity0 holds a press conference on friday ahead of their @entity30 tie @entity31 has been no stranger to press room drama at any of his previous clubs before @entity27 @entity31 ( left ) waves in @entity7 and the manager notoriously had problems with @entity15 ( right ) never a stranger to press room drama			1
he ’s a manager that reacts , that acts on instincts			2
yet his latest stunt was far more calculated			0
the @entity27 managers of the 1930s , 1940s , 1950s , and so on were n’t pestered by in - depth statistics			1
even sir @entity47 ’s first decade at @entity48 was free of @entity49			1
yet @entity51 ’s analysis on sunday – ‘ we could n’t cope with the long balls @entity27 kept putting in the box ’ – hit @entity0 where it hurts			1
it struck a nerve and , in rebuttal , he compiled his own figures in a four - page dossier , courtesy of @entity62			2
it was unbecoming of a @entity27 manager			1
@entity31 – so keen to present the bare bones to @entity51 – forgot about the other skeletons in his closet			1
handing out those graphics gave others license to scrutinise his tactics and , by reacting , he was beaten			2
as the old rule in politics goes : ‘ if you ’re explaining , you ’re losing			2
’ @entity31 was clearly annoyed at @entity51 's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting @entity31 looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics against @entity79 @entity31 claims @entity27 made 49.9 per cent of ' long passes forward ' in comparison to @entity79 's 71 per cent @entity79 made just 11 of their 32 ' long and forward ' passes during the match , according to boss @entity31 long pass : a pass that is 35 + yards in distance aimed at a particular team - mate			1
this does n’t have to be forward			0
long ball : a pass that is 35 + yards in distance launched in to a space / area on the pitch rather than a precise pass to a team - mate ( ie. a ball in to the channels )			2
fulfilling press duties in @entity5 was testing for @entity31 , and it has n’t been dissimilar in @entity99			1
since his official welcome on july 16 , he ’s had to explain his tactics a few times			0
why , for example , use @entity103 in midfield ? are n’t you exhausting the faltering partnership of @entity107 and @entity108 ? what ’s happened to @entity110 – your first purchase at £ 29million – and why has he not started a @entity113 game since december 2 ? is your less aggressive style of play restricting @entity117 ’s influence ? and so on			1
this week the focus switched to passing , or , as @entity51 pointed out , long balls			0
yet what is one of those ? @entity49 tell us a long pass ‘ is 35 + yards in distance aimed at a particular team - mate ’ , while a long ball ‘ is 35 + yards in distance launched in to a space or area on the pitch rather than a precise pass to a team - mate ’			1
@entity31 pictured during his team 's @entity113 match at @entity48 against @entity136 @entity31 acknowledges misfiring striker @entity108 at @entity48 against @entity136 @entity141 ’s assist for @entity139 ’s diving header against @entity5 at the @entity140 , for example , was a long pass – not a long ball – because it was aimed directly at the @entity145 striker			1
a difference which @entity31 made sure we understood with his graphics and diagrams			2
and so to wednesday night , when @entity136 lost 3 - 1 at @entity48			1
did the club second bottom in the @entity113 deserve to leave empty handed ? hardly			0
@entity27 attempted 99 , more than @entity136 ’s 74 and , just to be fair , @entity79 ’s 74 against @entity151			2
their accuracy ( 56.6 per cent ) was superior to @entity136 ( 50 ) and @entity79 ( 37.8 )			0
their long passes this year ( 1,960 ) obliterate the rest of the @entity113			0
@entity136 ( 1,951 ) are close behind , before @entity155 ( 1,915 ) come third			0
this is reflected in possession with their average ( 59.54 per cent ) second only to @entity160 ( 60.11 )			0
@entity27 this season are executing more long balls on average ( 21.6 ) than under @entity165 ( 16.5 ) or sir @entity47 ( his most being 20.55 in 2010/11 ) but , on wednesday , they knocked far fewer ( 27 ) into space than @entity136 ( 37 ) and @entity79 ( 45 )			1
@entity31 was accused of playing long - ball style but the numbers suggest otherwise ( and so does he ! ) yet dispelling the long - ball theory does little			1
this was not a classic performance			0
nothing to write home about			0
just look at a pick of the reaction to a win that kept them third in the @entity113 : patience is wearing thin			0
the man that had the cojones to replace @entity6 goalkeeper @entity183 with @entity185 ’s @entity184 in the 120th minute of @entity145 ’s @entity140 quarter - final is being questioned			1
@entity31 admitted @entity136 were the better team			2
play like that on monday against @entity188 and you ’ll be out of the @entity30 , he added			0
he even acknowledged a negative atmosphere			0
@entity31 acknowledged a hostile atmosphere at @entity48 despite their 3 - 1 win over @entity136 in @entity7 , it was @entity15			1
in @entity196 , it is @entity103			1
@entity99 ’s most reliable forward has the no 9 and no 10 roles inside him			0
yet he is cleaning up at the back , defusing attacks rather than starting them , showing versatility , doing as he is told			0
he has not had a single shot on target in the @entity113 in 2015 after six matches and 450 minutes of football			0
those 25 goals that separate @entity103 from sir @entity209 ’s all - time @entity27 record of 249 seem as far away as ever			1
when @entity15 was marooned on the left wing and voiced his desire to play centrally , the man that would go on to win the 2002 @entity140 was dropped from the first team			1
if @entity103 was to argue his case to be used up front again ... he would n’t , would he ? @entity103 ( left ) controls the ball under pressure from @entity136 's @entity218 on wednesday @entity103 's heat map against @entity136 shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line yet for a manager seemingly unafraid to bench big names , he remains hellbent on partnering @entity139 and @entity108			1
against @entity136 , @entity108 made 20 passes , won three duels but lost 11 , created two chances , and managed zero shots on or off target			1
he did , however , assist @entity230			0
@entity139 , meanwhile , made 30 passes , created one chance , and had one shot on or off target – from the penalty spot			2
more than £ 500,000 on wages that week , and a single shot between them			0
@entity239 may be ‘ struggling to watch ’ a joyless @entity27 , but all is not lost			1
they have been beaten just once in 18 games , and @entity243 qualification remains within reach			2
the ends must justify the means			0
finish in the top four , and all is forgiven			0
@entity249 out , and @entity31 can expect just as many of those uncomfortable questions as his first stint in @entity7			1
@entity108 has not been living up to his reputation for @entity27 since joining on loan from @entity254 @entity31 remains hellbent on partnering @entity107 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) up front when a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then , yeah , you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context i believe			1
i think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me , or the game , or the players and now you say that you have no opinion			0
when you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls ? yeah , long balls , in the width , to switch the play			0
you have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls , but long balls wide , rather than to the striker			0
a ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long - ball play			2
because i expected this question , i have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then i have to say that it is not a good interpretation from @entity51			0
it is not so difficult also to read that			0
i am sorry , but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed , in spite of many chances in the second half , then i changed my playing style			1
then , of course , with the quality of @entity298 we played more forward balls and we scored from that , so i think it was a very good decision of the manager			2
but , when you see overall the long ball , and what is the percentage of that , then @entity79 have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49			0
so , i give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult , which is why i began with the explanation of ball possession			0
when you have 60 per cent ball possession you can not play long balls			0
so again , they did it 71 and we 49 , and i give it you , you can copy it and then maybe you can go to @entity51 and he will get a good interpretation .			0

@entity0 had his moments with the @entity7 press during his first stint between 1997 and 2000 - even *********slapping********* a *********television********* *********camera********* once
the @entity27 manager played @entity15 out of position and the 1999 @entity13 winner was dropped after saying he wanted to play central
@entity103 is being used in midfield instead of up front under @entity31
@entity31 never liked being criticised for his tactics at the @entity3
the @entity335 has been questioned since moving to @entity48 , including about using @entity107 and @entity108 up front
@entity31 can expect more *********awkward********* questions about his *********unordinary********* tactics and playing style if he fails to secure @entity243 football
‘ worst performance of the season easily . i ’ve never been annoyed after a win in my life until *********tonight********* . ’ @entity347 , @entity348
‘ get off your *********twitchy********* ass and stop playing *********favouritism********* with c ********* ********* p players . ’ @entity354 , @entity196
‘ how can a manager of this calibre not see that @entity139 and @entity108 ca **n't** play with each other ? ! ’ *frasersimmons* , @entity356
‘ i think @entity0 is a top manager but at the minute he is getting it all wrong . @entity103 *cm* ? @entity110 never playing ? and do **n't** get me started on the @entity139 - @entity108 partnership . ’ @entity364 , @entity196
‘ how we managed to be sitting in third place in the league table right now is a *miracle* . ’ @entity370 , @entity371
