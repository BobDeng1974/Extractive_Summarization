by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 9 october 2013 the @entity2 s financial secretary @entity1 will extend the deadline so more victims of the @entity6 scandal can be helped ministers will today launch a campaign to find 400,000 ‘ lost ’ victims of the @entity6 scandal who can not be traced			1
the @entity2 ’s financial secretary @entity1 will announce that around £ 1 million a day has been paid out since ministers agreed a £ 1.5 billion compensation scheme in 2011			1
but poor data means that 400,000 of the estimated one million victims of the saga can not be traced			1
mr @entity1 will today extend the deadline for claims by at least a year to give people more time to come forward			1
he will also announce plans for a national advertising campaign to highlight the existence of the @entity22 to policy holders who may not realise they could be eligible for compensation			2
last night mr @entity1 said : ‘ this government has allocated up to £ 1.5bn to help the policyholders of @entity6 who suffered an injustice , with hundreds of thousands of policy holders receiving over £ 700 million in payments since 2011			1
‘ we ’ve made strong progress , but we want to maximise the number of people who will eventually receive payments , which is why we are extending the @entity36 to mid- 2015			1
’ the near - collapse of @entity6 in the year 2000 left hundreds of thousands of policy holders out of pocket			2
following a long campaign by the @entity42 , chancellor @entity40 announced a major compensation scheme to help those who lost money on their pension investments			2
the latest figures show that a total of £ 734 million has been paid out so far			1
but the @entity2 has faced criticism for failing to do more to track down victims of the scandal			2
many policy - holders lost half their life savings when @entity6 , a previously well - regarded insurer , came to the brink of collapse in 2000 after promising unrealistic annuity rates to investors			0
the near - collapse of @entity6 in the year 2000 left hundreds of thousands of policy holders out of pocket others have died waiting for successive governments to restore their lost money			0
in july , the commons public accounts committee said the lack of publicity about the compensation scheme meant there was a ‘ real risk ’ that tens of thousands of people would lose out			0
the committee ’s @entity71 chairman said she was ‘ stunned ’ by evidence that the @entity2 had destroyed details and addresses of 353,000 policy holders provided by the @entity77 on data protection grounds			0
but @entity2 sources pointed out @entity71 had failed to act on the scandal for a decade before mr @entity40 decided to take action			0
the @entity82 also criticised the @entity2 for failing to do enough preparatory work before launching the compensation scheme			0
the @entity2 last night blamed poor data from @entity6 for the failure to track down more eligible policy holders			0
a source said the list of addresses provided by the firm was more than 20 years old , with some details missing altogether			0
more than 400,000 policies were supplied without contact addresses			0
officials are already using the electoral roll and credit records to try and track down those potentially owed compensation , as well as sending letters to victims ’ last known addresses			2
the compensation scheme had been due to expire in april next year , but will now be extended until ‘ mid 2015 ’ .			1

@entity1 said there are still a million victims of financial storm
the deadline for claims has been extended to 2015
