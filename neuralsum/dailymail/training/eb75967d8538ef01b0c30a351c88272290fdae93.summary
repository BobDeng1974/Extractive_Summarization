sexy : this is a typical image which would arouse a man - but a woman 's desire is much more unpredictable for decades , we have been led to believe that men are driven by a base need to ' spread their seed ' and lust after many partners , while women desire monogamy and their sexual fulfillment comes from emotional intimacy			1
but an author who has researched female sexuality has said anyone who thinks women are inherently less promiscuous and sexually assertive than men is kidding themselves			1
writer @entity18 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , says the idea that women are ' biologically programmed ' to be monogamous is a ' myth ' that has been perpetuated for too long			2
he told @entity24 : ' i think that one of our conventional assumptions - that women are biologically programmed by evolution to be less promiscuous , less assertive , and less driven sexually - is a myth			0
' there is very little evidence to support this theory			0
it gets in the way of serious understanding			0
' @entity18 , 53 , has written a book on the subject , called ' what do women want ? : adventures in the @entity43 ' , which has been re-published this month by @entity44			1
he busts a number of myths through his research , based on scientific studies , which include theories that women want less sex than men , watch less porn and that their desire is sparked by emotional intimacy			1
in fact , @entity18 said the research he has seen reveals women can be just as much of an ' animal ' as a men when it comes to sex and that their desires are actually a lot more wild and unpredictable			1
at the start of the book and in a video on @entity44 's website , he explains a test that @entity71 carried out to determine what really turns women on			2
she wired up a plethysmograph to women 's private parts and then showed them a series of images to monitor what made them become aroused			1
@entity18 explains : ' the results reveal that women get turned on by all sorts of videos			1
straight women get turned on by naked women exercising ; lesbian women get turned on by gay male porn ; the sight apes having sex is a turn on			1
' writer @entity18 has debunked myths surrounding female sexuality in his recently re-released book , right but he added that many women were in denial about what they found to be a turn on			1
' the plethysmograph was showing lots of arousal when women were telling @entity104 they did n't feel turned on at all , ' he said			0
... ' what turned men on was a lot more predictable and a lot more boring ' @entity18 told @entity24 that this repression of sexual desire has been drummed into women for ' eons '			1
many other studies he looked into found women lied about , or were too embarrassed to admit , what really turned them on			2
often women would only give honest answers to questions , such as whether they watched porn and how many sexual partners they have had , if they were told their input would be completely anonymous			0
' though we live in a culture that is , in many ways , sexually unrestrained , we are still uneasy , even fearful , about women 's desire			2
this goes back eons , ' @entity18 explains			2
' it is somehow overwhelming to confront the realities of female sexuality			2
' he adds that perhaps female sexuality has been repressed in order to create some balance and order in society			1
' sexuality is a potentially anarchic force , and it is comforting to believe that - innately - half the population , the female half , is at least comparatively civilised when it comes to sex			0
it is soothing to believe that women are genetically scripted to serve as a stabilising force , ' he said			0
yet @entity18 has discovered female sexuality is a lot more interesting than men 's			1
animal instincts : women can be just as sexually aggressive and promiscuous as men , according to research revealed in the book when men were shown the same images as the women during @entity71 ' test , ' what turned them on was a lot more predictable and a lot more boring , ' he notes			1
@entity18 said @entity71 ' study also contradicts the idea that all women want to to settle down with one man - and that they will have the best sex with that one man - because of the emotion intimacy their relationship brings			1
in fact , @entity71 ' study found the plethysmograph ' flat - lined ' when the women were shown images of their love - term lovers			0
seeing someone they knew was a ' lust - killer '			0
but images of a handsome stranger were a turn on			0
however , while @entity18 has explored what women want in his book , he humbly admits he ca n't give a definitive answer			2
he said : ' i do n't mean to imply ( by the book 's title ) that i have a single answer - or that a single answer exists			0
that would be not only arrogant but terribly and monumentally foolish			0
we human beings are too complex for single answers , and our complexity is what makes a book like this a challenge and finally a pleasure to write			0
i hope that our complexity makes the book a pleasure to read as well			0
' in the spirit of further research , @entity44 is running a survey to find out what women really want , which you can answer at @entity211 ' @entity212 : adventures in the @entity43 ' has been re-published as a paperback this month			0

@entity18 has written a book , ' what do women want ? '
it 's based on scientific studies of female sexuality
study revealed straight women turned on by a naked woman exercising
gay women were turned on by two men having sex
sight of apes having sex was also arousing
result of female sexuality being repressed for ' eons '
