by @entity0 published : 15:10 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 15:27 est , 11 june 2012 @entity1 , was 30 years old when she embarked on her one year weight - loss challenge on @entity4 's @entity3 : weight loss edition and had been battling fertility issues on account of her size			1
weighing in at 355lbs , the @entity10 , @entity11 , native was depressed , insecure and embarrassed to let even her husband see her naked			1
now boasting a trim 148lb body , @entity1 wowed viewers on last night 's episode with the biggest weight loss in television history having shed over 58per cent of her body weight from start to finish			1
and since family is what spurred her on her mission , the humbled reality star can only be thankful for her incredible achievements so far			2
she told @entity4 : ' i 'm not sure i would have fought as hard as i did if i was n't as motivated by the thought of having a family			0
' at 14 years of age , @entity1 had been a bright teenager with a natural gift for singing and a promising future until one night at a party , a young boy attacked her			1
unable to cope with the pain of keeping her shameful story a secret she turned to food and thus began a path towards morbid obesity and a life of misery			0
shame : at age 30 , @entity1 was so ashamed of her weight she would hide from her husband @entity57 when naked no pain no gain : training with @entity60 , the @entity10 native was motivated to shed the weight by her inability to conceive a child due to obesity under the guidance of @entity3 's trainer @entity60 , by the second week of her diet and exercise regime , @entity1 had converted her living room into an impressive workout space			1
@entity60 ' high expectations demanded that she drop a whopping 90lbs in the very first 30 days , a goal she reached and for which she and her husband , @entity57 , were rewarded with a long - overdue honeymoon trip to @entity76 on @entity4 's dime			0
but , it was n't all fun and games for @entity1			1
during the trip she was tasked with completing a gruelling 100 - kilometre bicycle ride over the hilly terrain			0
over the ensuing three months , she whittled her weight down to an admirable 210lbs and when she shed another 35lbs she became the first woman under @entity60 ' supervision to have lost 50per cent of her body weight in just nine months			1
this impressive achievement made her eligible for excess skin removal surgery , a procedure to remove the surplus flesh that often hangs off the bodies of those who lose drastic amounts of weight			2
stunning transformation : @entity1 made television history by losing over 58per cent of her body weight over the year and was rewarded with a @entity98 gift card valued at $ 50,000 new woman : since losing the weight for the reality show , @entity1 has kept up a healthy lifestyle and begun weight - loss coaching others including her younger sister who thanks to her help has lost 48lbs by the end of the year , weighing in at 148lbs , fit , strong and healthy both in mind and body , @entity1 was rewarded for her brave accomplishment by @entity98 with a $ 50,000 gift card			1
thanks to this money , the reality show victor told @entity4 , she was able to pursue her dreams and aspirations rather than return to work straight away			0
of her life - changing experience she said : ' i got this amazing gift and i want to share it with everyone i can			0
' and so , @entity1 has become a weight - loss coach herself			1
among her clients , she counts her very own sister who dropped 48lbs under her sister 's influence			0
and it is n't just her sister who has benefited from @entity1 's new found wisdom and fighting spirit			2
these days instead of chowing down on burgers and chips at get - togethers , her family have embraced new healthy foods and cook a feast of grilled chicken and vegetables instead			0
@entity139 : though @entity1 and @entity57 have been told her tubes are blocked and natural conception is unlikely , she is a good candidate for @entity29 treatment sharing the wisdom : @entity1 's family have benefited from her experience too and have substituted their diet of burgers and chips for grilled chicken and vegetables not only is she healthier , happier and excited to start a family , @entity1 has found her voice again and recently sang at her cousin 's wedding			2
' i found the biggest hurdle to weight loss is not your body but your brain			2
it was when i changed my mind about who i am , what i am worth , and what i am capable of doing			0
once i finally found my fight to lose the weight i realized life is a fight , ' she told @entity4			0
and just to put a perfect conclusion to an inspiring story , @entity1 will be encouraging next season 's @entity3 : weight loss edition hopefuls as a coach alongside @entity60			1
' getting to pay it forward it the greatest reward , i am so excited , ' she gushed .			0
