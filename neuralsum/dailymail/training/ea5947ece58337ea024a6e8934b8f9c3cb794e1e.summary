the shooting of president @entity1 , born on this day in 1917 , remains one of the world ’s most infamous assassinations , and its implications are still arguably being felt today			1
aside from the conspiracy theories shrouding the event , the impact of his death on 22 november 1963 has been pored over and studied for decades			1
but what if he had never been shot by @entity13 ? that was a question tackled by award - winning @entity16 television journalist @entity15 for @entity18 issue 13 , who considered how life in the following decades might have been different had @entity1 lived			1
what if @entity1 had never been killed ? @entity16 television journalist @entity15 ponders the question for @entity18 and discusses some of the implications if he had continued living into old age			1
pictured is an artist 's illustration of what @entity1 might have looked like in 1977 at the age of 60 @entity15 postulates that the @entity16 might have been embroiled in fewer international conflicts had @entity1 remained president			1
but closer to home , a suspected affair with @entity34 would have shocked the public in the same way @entity39 ’s affair with @entity40 did			1
and civil rights also might have made less progress if he had continued as head of state			0
on the subject of the @entity46 , @entity15 suggests that the terrifying events of the @entity48 in 1962 might have improved relations between the @entity16 and @entity50			1
' what if @entity1 had lived ? ' and much more is available to read in issue 13 of @entity53 , on sale today ‘ a lot of people look at the way @entity1 ran for president , very hawkish , very militant and in his inaugural speech he said he would pay any price , bear any burden , ’ says @entity15 to @entity55			1
‘ but they failed to recognise how much the @entity48 had affected him			0
‘ it ’s pretty clear that he and @entity68 [ former general secretary of the @entity69 ] had come close to presiding over a nuclear holocaust , it dramatically changed the way he looked at the world			1
‘ that ’s when he began looking for common ground with the @entity77 : a test - ban treaty , possibly other steps to turn down the temperature of the @entity46			1
’ and in terms of the @entity83 as well , events may have transpired in a more peaceful manner			0
‘ the evidence is , during the fall of 1963 , @entity1 had realised that @entity87 was a losing proposition , ’ continues @entity15			1
‘ he had carelessly authorised - or did n’t stop - a coup that had put new people in charge of @entity87			0
‘ he saw this as a situation that violated a fundamental belief of his about committing large numbers of @entity16 to a land war in @entity97			0
‘ he had always said to people that he wanted to disengage but he could n’t do it until he was re-elected in 1964 - the politics would n’t let him			0
‘ he would have been accused of being soft on communism			0
‘ my best guess is that he would have played for time in 1964 , tried to keep the status quo and tried to keep any incidents from arising			0
and ultimately , says @entity15 , ‘ i think we would have been spared [ an all - out ] war in @entity87			2
’ and , he continues , ' if we had been , the cultural clash in the @entity16 would have been very different in the late 1960s			0
’ while the so - called ‘ @entity109 ’ would have still occurred , @entity15 suggests there would n’t have been groups vehemently protesting against the @entity16 military			1
the @entity83 raged for many years and sparked huge protests across @entity16			1
@entity15 suggests , though , that if @entity1 had remained president the war might not have happened as it did			1
pictured is the @entity117 of the @entity118 in 1968 one of the potential scandals that threatened to undermine @entity1 ’s continued presidency was his rumoured affair with @entity34			1
it ’s believed they had an ongoing relationship , with @entity34 even thinking at one stage @entity1 would divorce his wife @entity126 and she would move into the @entity127 as the @entity128			1
and @entity15 says that if this had become common knowledge to the public , it could have been akin to the scandal that engulfed president @entity39 when his affair with @entity40 was revealed in 1998 - even though @entity34 died in 1962			1
‘ i asked some people whether @entity1 could have survived this scandal ' they said “ of course not ” , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ the cultural climate of the @entity16 in [ the early - 1960s ] compared to the 1990s was just radically different			2
‘ in 1964 we had a presidential candidate ' @entity140 ' who lost a key presidential primary just as his wife gave birth to a baby and it reminded people that he had left his older wife for a younger woman			0
‘ we had never had a divorced president in 1964 and there was no idea of “ oh well , it ’s private , everybody plays around a bit "			0
' @entity15 adds it ‘ would have been far more shocking ’ than the @entity39 scandal if @entity1 ’s administration failed to prevent the story from becoming public , which would have been ' hard '			1
@entity1 was assassinated during a motorcade in @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 on friday 22 november 1963 ( pictured )			1
@entity15 suggests that had he not been killed , he would have lived into moderate old age before succoming to one of the illnesses that ailed him in earlier life looking further into his life , @entity15 considers how his health might have curtailed his later years			2
‘ he suffered from all kinds of ailments , ’ he explains			0
‘ he had @entity175 ’s disease , he had horrible intestinal problems , he apparently had an untreated veneral disease and the combination of drugs he was taking for @entity175 ’s with his injury from the war made his back [ ache ] , just agony			0
‘ by the time he would have served a second term and in his early 50s , no one knows how his health would have been			0
’ and a final point @entity15 makes is on the subject of civil rights : would it have been such a big deal for @entity1 as it was for @entity191 ? the @entity192 famously outlawed discrimination based on race , colour , religion or sex			1
but with @entity1 still president , it ’s likely any such legislation would n’t have materialised until later			2
‘ @entity1 was n’t as passionate about civil rights , ’ says @entity15			2
‘ he was also much more a foreign - policy president			0
‘ if @entity1 could have avoided the war in @entity87 at the cost of going easy on civil rights , he would have done it			0
‘ we would have gotten there eventually , but more slowly than it would have happened under @entity191			0
’ real timeline @entity1 is elected to the @entity209 - 4 november 1952 after eight years in the @entity210 , @entity1 wins the 1952 election for a seat in the @entity209			1

@entity1 reacts by creating a naval quarantine that inspects all @entity77 ships arriving at @entity233			2
concerns about @entity87 - april 1963 in his assessment of the @entity87 situation , @entity1 says : ' we do n’t have a prayer of staying in @entity87 [ … ] they are going to throw our asses out [ … ] but i ca n’t give up that territory to the communists and get the @entity16 people to re-elect me			1
' @entity1 assassinated - 22 november 1963 while visiting @entity163 , @entity164 , riding in an open - top car , @entity1 is shot three times : once in the head , once in the back and once in the neck , dying from his wounds			1
the @entity192 is legislated - 2 july 1964 new president @entity191 uses @entity1 ’s death as a catalyst to push the @entity192 through @entity255			2
the act outlaws discrimination against race , religion , gender , colour or nationality , in schools , work and public facilities			0
@entity266 issued - 24 september 1964 a year after the @entity266 , which investigates the assassination of @entity1 , is established , the report is returned to @entity191 : it concludes that @entity13 and @entity269 had acted alone			2

@entity217 elected president - 5 november 1968 former vice president @entity217 , who ran against @entity1 in the 1960 election , finally gets his shot at being president			1
his first term is popular : he negotiates treaties with the @entity50 , enforces civil rights and he is re-elected in a landslide victory			0
@entity286 - 17 june 1972 president @entity217 ’s popularity takes a downswing early into his second term and , in an effort to fight his opponents , the @entity217 administration tries to bug the @entity294 headquarters , among other clandestine activities			0
they are caught and @entity217 is forced to resign			0
alternative timeline @entity1 re-elected - 3 november 1964 @entity1 runs against @entity218 @entity298 and wins his second term in the @entity127 in a landslide victory			2
@entity301 and a tough stance against the perceived threat of the @entity77 wins him over two - thirds of the vote			0
@entity1 holds back from @entity87 - 8 march 1965 reluctant to commit any kind of force to a ‘ land war in @entity97 ’ , the @entity310 and three @entity312 torpedo boats enter a standoff in the @entity314 , but ultimately nothing happens			0
race riots across the @entity16 - 1966 the promise of a @entity192 to end discrimination in the @entity16 , which never materialises , proves too much for @entity16 ’s black and ethnic communities			0

@entity1 dies - 1978 @entity1 is in poor health by the end of his second term			0
his ailments finally catch up with him and he dies ten years after leaving office .			0

president @entity1 was born 97 years ago today in 1917
he was assassinated on 22 november 1963 - but what if he had *n't* been ?
@entity16 television journalist @entity15 tackles the implications of this
one suggestion is that the @entity83 might not have happened as it did
while averting ' nuclear holocaust ' with the @entity77 may have halted the @entity46
and the affair with @entity34 could have been a public scandal akin to @entity39 's in 1998
