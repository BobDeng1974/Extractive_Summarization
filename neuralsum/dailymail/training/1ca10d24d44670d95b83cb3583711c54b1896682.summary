for one lucky sheep his ability to be a real woolly jumper has saved him from the pot after a farmer 's grand - daughter spotted his extraordinary ability to leap over fences and began training him			0
the ram , named @entity10 because owners initially thought he was female , now follows 13 - year - old @entity13 , wherever she goes in the fields near @entity15 , @entity16			1
@entity10 can be seen jumping over hurdles and streams in a video of one of their training sessions			1
the highest he 's ever jumped is about one metre			0
in daily training sessions @entity13 jumps over obstacles and calls out commands to @entity10 the two - year - old ram a special hurdle has been made for @entity10 , who has been trained to jump up to 3ft over the wooden bar @entity10 was saved from the slaughterhouse when @entity13 noticed his ability to jump very high over fences ‘ i train him once a day - as much as possible basically - when i 'm free and he follows me around			1
’ @entity53 uses treats to train @entity10 , ‘ he likes anything - from corn to croissants - he 's very greedy			1
' he even started licking my drinking bottle a few weeks ago - it had @entity28 in it and he now ca n't get enough of that either			1
‘ i show him a jump , i jump it , and then he follows me - most of the time			2
and if not i have to stand over the jump , with one leg each side and entice him over			2
' and then he knows to jump it and gets rewarded			0
it 's basically how you train a dog - you reward it when it 's been good			0
the two - year - old sheep , on of 60 on her grandfather 's farm , was spared the slaughterhouse when @entity13 noticed his agility			0
@entity13 added : ‘ he 's not a perfect specimen for breeding and was going to go for slaughter but granddad now says i can keep him			0
’ @entity13 has made a special hurdle for the jumping sheep - she has measured different heights for the bar to go on			1
she normally starts him off at 2ft and gradually raises the bar to as close to 3ft as he can manage before he gets full up with treats and wanders off to play with the rest of the flock			0
@entity13 's mother , @entity93 , said : ' i think it 's wonderful that @entity53 absolutely adores @entity10			1
after school she makes sure the sheep are okay and reports back to her granddad			0
' it 's lovely she takes so much care in training @entity10			2

@entity10 is trained daily with croissants and @entity28 as rewards for jumps
special hurdle made for him to jump over bars of *varying* heights
