by @entity0 published : 21:18 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 22:50 est , 19 march 2013 these fascinating images show the final resting places of two moon probes which crashed onto the moon			1
an eagle - eyed @entity6 spacecraft managed to locate the crash sites of the twin spacecraft @entity9 and took these images of their final resting spots			1
yesterday , the space agency released the before - and - after pictures of the lunar north pole where @entity9 came to rest			1
crash site : these @entity6 images show the crash site before , left , and after , right , where one moon probe crashed onto the surface of the moon			1
small craters and dots mark the site the images show small craters and dots which mark the impact sites			1
the spacecraft broke into smithereens upon impact and pinpointing the small craters they carved was difficult , said @entity32 researcher @entity31 , who operates the camera of the @entity34			2
even the mission 's chief scientist , @entity35 , was surprised when she saw the images of the impact sites which looked like dots			1
' i was expecting to see skid tracks , ' said @entity35 of the @entity40			0
@entity9 deliberately plunged into a lunar mountain in december after mapping the moon 's gravity field in unprecedented detail			2
the location was chosen because it was far away from the @entity47 landings and other historic sites			0
damage : these before , left , and after , right , images show the crash site of the second moon probe			2
these images were taken by @entity6 's @entity34 since the finale occurred in the dark , telescopes from @entity54 did not capture it			2
even the reconnaissance orbiter had to wait until sunlight streamed to the northern lunar region			0
launched in 2011 , the spacecraft spent nearly a year flying in formation , exclusively collecting gravitational data			0
among the discoveries : the lunar crust is much thinner and more battered than scientists had imagined			0
initially flying at 35 miles above the lunar surface , the spacecraft dipped lower and lower in altitude during the $ 487 million mission			0
resting places : this topographic map shows the two impact areas of the twin spacecraft @entity9			1
it deliberately crashed into the surface of the moon last year scientists are still pouring through the last chunk of data beamed back just before their demise			0
the @entity9 crash sites were named in honour of mission team member , @entity84 , the first @entity85 woman in space who died last year			1
ride 's educational company supplied the cameras on the mission that allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other geological features .			0
