@entity0 has insisted he never intended to play for another @entity2 club after leaving @entity3 in the summer			1
the 36 - year - old midfielder was caught in an embarrassing row after @entity6 were forced to admit they had unintentionally misled the public on both sides of the @entity9 from the moment it was announced @entity0 had ‘ signed ’ for @entity12 on a two - year deal last summer			1
that , was not true			0
nor was the subsequent announcement that the 36 - year - old had joined @entity6 on a ‘ loan ’ until the end of the calendar year			1
the truth , admitted by @entity6 , is that @entity0 put his name only to a pre-contract agreement with @entity12 , stipulating that he would join them on january 1			1
@entity6 have admitted that they have misled fans and @entity25 over @entity0 city had wrongly claimed that @entity0 signed for @entity25 last summer before agreeing a loan move but @entity0 insisted that despite the furore he will move there in the summer			1
he told @entity30 : ' i had sat down with @entity32 ( @entity33 , the chief executive of both clubs ) and it was all about @entity25			2
there was no mention of @entity6			1
if they had wanted to speak to me on behalf of @entity6 , with @entity25 in the pipeline beyond that , because i was a free agent , but that was never the question at all			2
' to be honest when i thought about five or six months off , i thought it was quite a result			0
i thought i 've been playing solid for a long , long time			0
it will be a good break			0
i 'll find a way to keep fit			0
i thought i maybe could train with @entity3			0
' the only binding contract he signed was with @entity6 , one that saw him contracted to the club for one season with a ‘ break clause ’ inserted that would enable him to head to @entity25 for @entity56 pre-season in january if deemed convenient			1
@entity0 smiles during his press conference after it was announced he would be joining the @entity56 club the former @entity3 man pictured in action during @entity6 's @entity2 clash with @entity63 @entity6 , quite legally , removed that clause on @entity65 in order to keep him until the end of the season			1
@entity0 has made 19 appearances for @entity6 in all competitions , scoring seven goals , including a late equaliser against @entity3 , when he refused to celebrate			1
he added : ' in a million years i would n't celebrate if i scored against @entity3			2
i used to celebrate when i scored against @entity75 , but that was a different situation			2
when i left @entity75 there was a hostility from me towards them over certain things - old new now			0
but with @entity3 ? never			0
' i swear to @entity81 , if i went to @entity82 and they booed me for 90 minutes and i scored the winner , i still would n't celebrate			2
it would never come into my head and i think the fans there understand me and how i feel about it			0
i would never celebrate against @entity3			0

@entity12 fans were told they had signed @entity0
but the @entity95 midfielder was then ' loaned ' to @entity6
the club have now revealed he never actually signed for @entity12
@entity0 insists he never intended to join another @entity2 club
he says he will not celebrate at @entity102 even if he is booed
