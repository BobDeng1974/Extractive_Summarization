football agents were left in limbo on wednesday as they awaited news on new regulations			1
as of april 1 , the licensing system for agents is to change so that anyone can become a football agent as long as they pay £ 500 for an initial one - year registration period			1
the @entity10 will then charge £ 250 for every subsequent year of renewal			0
already established licensed agents were exempt			1
the @entity10 is due to place a link on their website for intermediaries to register , but as of 1pm that was still not in place			1
@entity18 thinks the new regulations on becoming a football agent will ' create anarchy ' the new guidelines have come in after @entity23 effectively washed their hands of governing agents			1
@entity23 recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of ' impeccable character ' , all deals annually published online , agents ' fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under the age of 18			2
the @entity10 , @entity37 and @entity38 have been discussing how best to cope with @entity23 opting out			0

@entity53 striker @entity52 ( right ) with his agent @entity54 pictured last year ' i can see the bloke in the pub who knows a parent or a footballer 's dad saying ' i 'll represent you ' and then undercutting everyone			2
' ' it is clearly wrong and anti-competitive to have this kind of price - capping			0
the @entity10 are saying we 've got to do it because that 's what @entity23 are telling us to do			0
the three per cent cap will destroy the business of probably 50 % of my members			0
' @entity43 ( @entity43 ) has been holding discussions to reach a compromise and have pushed for self regulating			0
