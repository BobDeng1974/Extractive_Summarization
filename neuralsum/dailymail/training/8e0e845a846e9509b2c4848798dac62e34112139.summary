by @entity1 reporter published : 23:28 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 26 september 2013 a glitch in the @entity6 app on newer iphones and @entity8 guides people up to a runway at a major @entity12 airport instead of sending them on the proper route to the terminal , an airport official said wednesday			1
the map actually stops at the tarmac , but twice this month , wayward drivers have continued across an active runway			1
" it does n't actually tell you to cross , but the problem is , people see the terminal then at that point , because they are right there , and they just continue across , " said @entity20 spokeswoman @entity19			1
lost : @entity6 is sending people driving onto an active runway at @entity20 there were no injuries in either the sept. 6 incident or the second one friday , mainly because they both happened early in the morning , between flights			1
" obviously , it could have been a very , very , very dangerous situation had they come during a flight departure or arrival , " @entity19 said			0
that entrance to the taxiway has now been barricaded from traffic			0
the first incident involved an out - of - state visitor trying to return a rental car before a flight , and the second was an @entity12 resident trying to get to the airport			0
once the control tower and airport personnel noticed the cars , the people were safely escorted away			0
" both parties that did it said they were following the directions on their @entity55 , " @entity19 said			0
danger ! : the barricaded entrance to a taxiway , at @entity59 blocking access to @entity61 in @entity20 , @entity12 in july , state rep. @entity62 , @entity63 , had a close call of his own when he was trying to make a flight after a meeting			1
he was in an unfamiliar part of @entity68 and decided to use his @entity55 map app to take the shortest route to the airport			2
@entity62 said the app took him to some weird places in @entity20 , and then to the small plane airport near the international airport			1
yet another problem : this glitch is the latest in a series of problems that have plagued @entity6 " eventually , it told me to make a right onto the small plane runway , which in fact was the shortest way to get to the big airport , " he said			1
" i give the @entity55 app credit for that			2
" but he did not heed the directions : " i 'm not a big fan of driving on runways			0
" after the first incident , airport personnel immediately attempted to contact @entity6			2
the airport is a state facility , and the @entity12 attorney general 's office also reached out to @entity6 's legal department			2
" it was our understanding it would be taken care of last week , " @entity19 said , but then the second mishap happened friday			0
the app was still incorrect wednesday morning , she said			0
@entity101 , @entity102 - based @entity6 did n't immediately return a message to @entity1 on wednesday to be fair , the drivers deserve some blame			1
the maps stop at the runway , but the drivers continued about a mile through a gate , past warning lights , numerous signs and painted concrete markings saying not to proceed			2
" all of these things were disregarded because people simply trusted their device more than they trusted what they were seeing , " she said .			0

the glitch only affects newer iphones and @entity8 running @entity6
drivers are directed onto the tarmac at @entity20 , but have driven onto an active runway
no injuries or *accidents* have occurred as a result of the faulty app
