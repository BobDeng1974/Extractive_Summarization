by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 while the @entity4 squad continue to put in the hard yards ordered by @entity6 , their new manager is clocking up air miles as he works on the next chapter of his distinguished career			1
@entity10 flew back on sunday with the @entity12 squad after leading them to third place at the @entity15			1
he will spend just two days at home before starting work in @entity18 , and another 48 hours in @entity19 before @entity4 fly to @entity20 to start their @entity22 tour			1
@entity10 ’s stock appears to have risen in @entity24 , where he became the first @entity12 coach to go unbeaten in 90 minutes and extra-time at a @entity15			1
the players were put through two double sessions during their first week back and were then called in for a workout on sunday			2
‘ i do n’t need a holiday , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ it ’s great to have such an exciting challenge			0
to work daily with young people is something i do n’t need time off to rest for			0
i ’ve only met two people from the daily management , the chief scout and the chief executive officer			0
and two of the owners			0
' it ’s time i got to know more people			0
i will do my best			0
whether that ’s enough for the fans , i will wait and see , but i hope that will be the case			0
' @entity10 has been credited with bringing unity to a @entity12 set - up that , historically , has not provided the most harmonious of environments			1
after a 5 - 1 win over @entity71 in the opening game , @entity12 finished top of @entity74 and beat @entity75 then @entity76 , on penalties , before losing a shootout to @entity79 in the semi-final			2
now @entity10 wants to create a similar spirit at @entity4 following a calamitous season under @entity83			1
one of the first tasks will be to address the relationship between @entity86 and @entity87			2
captain material ? @entity87 could become @entity4 skipper after leading his country at the @entity15 stepping up : @entity86 was set to inherit the captaincy at @entity92 but the striker could now miss out going nowhere : @entity94 ( left ) says he wo n't be leaving @entity95 to join @entity10 at @entity4 @entity86 was set to inherit the captaincy from @entity97 , but @entity99 ’s role as @entity12 skipper and his close relationship with the coach suggests that he is now a leading contender			1
‘ there will always be a place in my heart for these 23 players , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ i hope the group in @entity18 will become like this one			0
’ but @entity10 ’s attempts to persuade @entity94 to join him seem to have been unsuccessful			1
‘ i have a special bond with @entity10 , he is the most important coach in my career , ’ said @entity94			1
‘ ( moving to @entity4 ) is not an option , though			0
i will stay at @entity95			0

@entity10 flew back to @entity12 on sunday after guiding the @entity113 to third place at the @entity15
he will spend just two days at home before starting his new role as manager of @entity4
the 62 - year - old will only have 48 hours in @entity19 before departing for @entity4 *'s* @entity22 tour
the former @entity124 boss must *decide* who his captain will be , with @entity87 a strong contender
@entity94 has ruled out following @entity10 to @entity92
