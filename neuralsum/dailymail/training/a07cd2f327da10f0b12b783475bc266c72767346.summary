by @entity0 like his father and grandfather before him , @entity1 rules @entity4 with such terrifying control that most of his subjects know very little about the world outside of their impoverished nation			1
but thanks to the digital revolution , his totalitarian regime is now finding it increasingly difficult to hide the temptations of a better life from his brutalised people			2
nor can he prevent the world from seeing the stark realities inside the world 's most secretive state where people have reportedly been executed simply for watching films and owning a @entity22			1
the erosion of @entity1 's iron rule at the hands of technological change has now been explored in fascinating detail in a new documentary which has gained access to astonishingly brave undercover film - makers and defectors			1

recent reports reveal more than a quarter of @entity4 children under five are stunted by extreme malnutrition , while rural poverty remains endemic			0
according to the @entity83 , one eight - year - old boy called @entity37 is filmed looking unsteady on his feet from hunger as he explains that his mother found it too hard to look after him so ' she told me i have to go			1
' ' so i left and now i live outside , ' he adds			2
courageous : former political prisoner mr @entity90 escaped to @entity91 and now smuggles radios , usb sticks and dvds of soap operas and action films in the hope @entity4 will ' start wanting to live differently ' life in his hands : undercover footage of mr @entity90 smuggling dvds at night on the @entity4 border where guards have a shoot - to - kill policy learning about the @entity105 : mr @entity90 says that his biggest hit so far has been the @entity108 movie @entity109 ( above ) the documentary also follows mr @entity90 , a former inmate of a political prison camp who escaped to the west and now smuggles usb sticks and dvds of @entity91 soap operas and entertainment shows into the @entity4			1

mr @entity90 says that his biggest hit so far has been the @entity108 movie @entity109			0
he said : ' the more people are exposed to such media the more likely they are to become disillusioned with the regime and start wanting to live differently			1
' one of those was 22 - year - old @entity128 who realised after defecting that she had been ' fooled ' by the regime			2
fled : @entity130 , 22 , tells how she had been ' fooled ' by the @entity4 regime getting the message across : @entity133 for @entity4 broadcasts to the state from @entity135 the charade played out by @entity4 is laid bare when one secret film - maker asks to buy goods in @entity76 's @entity139 only to be told that he ca n't			1
' they 're just for show , to impress the foreigners , ' says a staff member			0
another clip shows an ox and cart walking past a sign saying ' courage towards the future			0
let 's move forward ! ' the propaganda is remorseless in @entity4			0
many people wear a red badge with a picture of either a grinning ‘ @entity155 ’ – @entity155 who founded the personality cult around which this repressed nation revolves – or his simpering son @entity158 , the ‘ @entity158 ’ who died in 2011			0

propaganda : an ox and cart walks past a sign saying ' courage towards the future			0
let 's move forward ! ' totalitarian : every @entity4 household must display pictures of @entity1 and @entity155 on their walls and crucially , there are also signs of open dissent			1

and there are even mutterings of discontent and disrespect from a mid-ranking official commandeered to build a special railway to the supreme leader 's birthplace			2
' how much does he know about the military ? he should n't be there ... he 's hopeless ! ' he says			2
dictator : @entity4 leader @entity1 meets military officers in charge of psychological warfare against @entity91 as he praises them for safeguarding the socialist system , according to a state newspaper is control loosening ? @entity4 are forced to adhere to the @entity201 ideology - a doctrine which mixes @entity203 with the worship of @entity4 's founder @entity155 and his descendents the documentary will air days after a @entity91 newspaper alleged that several large - scale public executions of around 80 people had taken place in @entity4 earlier this month			1
in one , woman and children were herded into a sports stadium and forced to watch people being shot dead by machine gun fire			0
why the executions took place is difficult to ascertain , but the paper speculates that they may have been carried out to quell unrest and stop capitalist ideology from growing as they took place in areas of recent economic growth			0
some of the deaths may also have been a punishment for the perceived crimes of watching @entity91 movies , distributing pornography , using prostitutes and possessing bibles			0
@entity4 : life inside the @entity232 will be broadcast on @entity51 on november 14 at 11.05pm .			0
