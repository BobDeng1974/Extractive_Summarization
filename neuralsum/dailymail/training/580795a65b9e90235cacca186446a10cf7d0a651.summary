a high school graduate tired of having his car seats soaked after a day at the beach has created swimming shorts that stay dry - even while in the water			2
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , is funding his @entity9 swimwear line through @entity10 , and after 15 days he has already surpassed his $ 10,000 goal to raise $ 45,000			1
' we wanted to create a garment that could transition from a day at the beach , to a workout at the gym and a night on the town all without having to change , ' the 19 - year - old told @entity19			0
' when the garment is underwater the fabric creates an air surface around the shorts preventing water from seeping through the nanoscale whiskers , ' explained mr @entity5 , who would n't disclose which @entity33 company produces the fabric , but claims that the swim trunks dry 95per cent faster than any other swim shorts on the market			2
if his @entity10 campaign reaches $ 55,000 , mr @entity5 will also release a women 's line of swimwear made from the same material			1
' we want to create a unique garment which will allow women to feel comfortable in our shorts , whether they choose to wear them while swimming or over-top of their wet bikini , ' he said			0
the swimming trunks are made in @entity27 using @entity28 fabric - a polyester blend that prevents all water - based substances from absorption - which is manufactured and produced in @entity33 ' when the garment is underwater the fabric creates an air surface around the shorts preventing water from seeping through the nanoscale whiskers , ' explained ceo @entity5 mr @entity5 first got the idea , which took just nine months to conceive , after finally losing patience with having to dry his swim shorts after use			1
but the first prototype , he said , was a flop			0
' we spent all this money to get the top of the line nanotechnology coating imported from @entity76 to @entity6 - the spray was used for @entity79 applications , and is terribly unsafe , ' he admitted			0
' we thought we were going to create these awesome shorts that never would get wet because of the coating ! boy were we wrong , the shorts would n't even go over my waist due to how stiff the coating made them			2
' the shorts went from a navy blue to a white because of the coating and the smell was cancerous			0
' mr @entity5 scraped the idea of @entity93 coating and instead decided to investigate @entity93 fabric			2
' we wanted to create a garment that could transition from a day at the beach , to a workout at the gym and a night on the town all without having to change , ' 19 - year - old mr @entity5 told @entity19 mr @entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , is funding his @entity9 swimwear line through @entity10 , and after 15 days he has already surpassed his $ 10,000 goal to raise $ 45,000 ' our current provider created a unique blend which has been tested and perfected for swimwear , ' said mr @entity5			1
while there have been plenty of water - repelling swim shorts created before him , by @entity109 - made retailers such as @entity110 and @entity111 and @entity112 ( which both use @entity114 treatment on its fabrics ) , mr @entity5 says his inbuilt @entity28 makes @entity9 shorts ' revolutionary '			1
' water repelling technology has been out for quite some time now and offers surface spill protection , but the technology completely loses all forms of productivity when over encumbered with liquid due to it 's surface coating characteristics , ' said mr @entity5			0
' we also noticed that a lot of surface coatings which provide water repelling characteristics often fade over time			0
due to the characteristics of our fabric , the @entity28 will last as long as the stitching on the garment			1

@entity9 swimwear is made from fabric using @entity28 , which repels water
