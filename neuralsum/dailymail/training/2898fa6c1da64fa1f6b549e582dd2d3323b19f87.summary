by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 6 june 2013 designer department store @entity1 likes to push the boundaries when it comes to getting noticed			2
previous marketing activities have included a model wetting herself with excitement at the prospect of the shop 's seasonal sale , a ' walk of shame ' television advert , and beefy bulldogs being touted around in pricey handbags			0
but @entity1 ' new campaign for the fashionable @entity16 , is tongue - in - cheek and somewhat hilarious			0
keep calm ! @entity1 have unveiled its new campaign for their famous @entity16 , with a play on the famous phrase , ' run round like a headless chicken ' playing on the famous phrase , ' run round like a headless chicken ' , the campaign created by @entity27 , features headless chickens dressed in key items from the @entity31 2013 collections , alongside the strap - line , ' the @entity25			1
try to stay calm '			0
@entity34 , @entity35 and marketing director at @entity1 said : ' @entity1 is world - renowned for its fabulous sale , with eager shoppers descending en masse to their nearest store in their efforts to lay their hands on our amazing reductions			2
' in humorous reaction to the ( often - irrational ) excitement sale time engenders , we have developed this campaign to capture the frantic effect that the @entity1 sale can have upon our customers			2
@entity53 cluck : the tongue - in - cheek campaign , created by @entity27 , features headless chickens dressed in key items from the @entity58 collections ' using the analogy of a ‘ headless chicken ’ for the creative concept really captured this in a fun , light hearted way			1
' you can never underestimate that feeling of finding the perfect sale purchase and with discounts of up to 50 per cent off - it is enough to excite and overwhelm even the most composed shopper in us all ! ' photographed by @entity73 , the campaign is illustrated through three different executions for womenswear , menswear and accessories , with the oh - so - stylish chickens sporting an @entity80 lace dress , a @entity82 sport jacket and @entity84 clutch			2
keep calm : the @entity1 campaign tagline is ' try to stay @entity87 ' and captures a chicken in full flight mode suggesting that they have struggled to do just that @entity92 and @entity93 , executive creative directors at @entity27 added : ' trying to come up with another great @entity25 ad is never easy			1
' we were running around like headless chickens until we saw this			1
' back in june 2012 , the luxury department store @entity1 came under fire for their advertising campaign , released to promote their summer sale			1
the glossy poster depicted a woman who has apparently - and there is no delicate way of putting this - wet her pants with excitement			0
in march this year , glossy images used to promote the store 's new @entity111 beauty hall featured three glamorous models appearing to lean in to kiss themselves in a reflection			0
the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) received 17 complaints about the adverts : nine that the images were unsuitable to be seen by children because they appeared to show a lesbian kiss , 10 that they were sexually explicit and two that the phrase ' love thyself ' in combination with the pictures was offensive on religious grounds			0
but it seems that the store have moved away from the controversy to have some fanciful fun with their advertising campaigns			0
@entity133 ? the @entity1 summer sale 2012 mailout was meant as a bit of ' light - hearted fun ' , say the store - but some sensitive shoppers took offence at the image , taking to @entity141 to criticise the flyers the 2012 ' @entity144 ' campaign received 17 complaints including nine that the images were unsuitable to be seen by children because they appeared to show a lesbian kiss sparking controversy : the ' @entity151 ' advert for @entity1 shown at @entity152 drew criticism for what some said was the glamorisation of one night stands canine companions : @entity1 ' spring campaign , @entity159 , featured three sizeable hounds being toted in super stylish handbags and was a far cry from the more controversial campaigns seen before the @entity164 launches online at 10am tuesday 11 and in - store wednesday 12 june , with up to 50 per cent off * .			1
