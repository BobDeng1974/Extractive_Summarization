@entity0 has told @entity1 that the only way to end his goal drought is to forget he ’s ever had one			1
the on - loan @entity6 striker turned in an improved display against @entity9 on wednesday but still could n’t prevent his run of games without scoring reaching double figures			1
the @entity13 , who at one stage boasted an 11 goals in 10 strike - rate , has cut a frustrated figure of late with talks over a permanent move to @entity20 failing to reach a satisfactory conclusion			1
‘ he has to stop thinking about it and he will score goals as well , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ because you have to think of the process , not results			1
goals come as a consequence of good processes			1
‘ that is maybe the most important thing i have to try and get into this culture			2
everything i hear is about results but you have to think how to get those results			2
‘ and when you fill all the boxes you need to , then you will get those results			2
that ’s how i work and how my players have to work as well			2
‘ when i see my players working 100 per cent and are switched on , then i know we are going to beat the other team			2
‘ one day it is @entity1 doing well , getting two or three goals , the next it is @entity60			1
if we are a good team , the chances will come			2
’ @entity0 believes that @entity1 ( left ) can follow @entity60 ' ( right ) example and return to scoring ways @entity0 ( right ) and assistant @entity66 ( left ) are also preparing for a @entity68 tie against @entity69 @entity0 ’s side face @entity71 at lunchtime today and he is adamant thursday ’s clash with @entity69 has n’t yet been mentioned to his players although he admits he is liable to pick his team for @entity76 with one eye on the @entity68 clash			1
‘ they wo n’t be on my mind , ’ said the @entity26 boss			1
‘ i have learned in this job that you have to take it one game at a time			2
‘ you have to keep the momentum going , you have to win , and if i do n’t think only of the next game then the players start to think of something else			0
‘ @entity69 is coming next week , but the biggest game is on saturday			0
if we have a good performance against @entity71 then we will take a lot of confidence into the game against @entity69			0
‘ i do n’t think the team on saturday will be the same as the team that plays @entity69			0
‘ we need competition , but healthy competition			0
it is like we want to make each other better			0
i pick the player i think best suits the game			0
‘ some players ca n’t handle the load to play so many games so we have to change			1
@entity109 did n’t play against @entity9 but he will be ready for saturday			0
‘ we have to use the squad wisely and always try to look ahead while keeping the consistency in training and matches			1
if we do that then everyone will develop			0
’ only @entity116 and @entity117 look set to miss out on thursday , but @entity69 have a defensive injury crisis brewing			0
former @entity120 stopper @entity119 has become the sixth member of @entity123 ’s rearguard to labelled a major doubt after suffering from sciatica and will definitely miss tomorrow ’s trip to @entity127			0
centre half @entity128 and right back @entity130 are both out with hamstring injuries and @entity133 international full back @entity134 will miss both legs with a thigh tear			1
@entity123 returned as manager of @entity69 for his second spell at the helm of the club in november defender @entity116 ( centre ) is a doubt for @entity26 's encounter against the @entity145 side next thursday additionally , @entity147 right back @entity146 is sidelined for the season after undergoing a knee operation			1
captain @entity150 is also struggling with a knee knock with @entity123 set to scramble together a makeshift defence to face the @entity153			0
meanwhile , @entity69 fans have been banned from tomorrow ’s clash at @entity127 after previous crowd trouble			0
the @entity158 club - who have had problems with their own supporters - have opted not to give @entity69 tickets for safety reasons for the @entity165 clash .			0

@entity13 striker @entity1 once had 11 goals in 10 games for @entity26
but he has now not hit the back of the *net* for the last 10 matches
@entity26 boss @entity0 feels the best way to score is to forget his drought
