she was not reported missing for almost eight hours after she was seen on cctv leaving the hospital a suicidal woman was found dead after walking out of a hospital while nurses ate birthday cake , an inquest heard			1
the body of @entity1 , 39 , was discovered at the foot of cliffs at @entity13 , @entity14 , on june 20 last year , the day after she went missing			1
the inquest heard that @entity16 , in the @entity17 run by the @entity18 in @entity19 , was ' chaotic ' while nurses celebrated a doctor 's birthday			2
she was not reported missing until almost eight hours after she was recorded on cctv leaving the hospital			1
ms @entity1 , from @entity19 , had previously absconded and travelled to @entity13 but had been saved by the intervention of a local chaplaincy team			1
a healthcare assistant had also allowed her to abscond on june 19 despite needing the express permission of a registered nurse			0
in giving evidence on the third day of the hearing at @entity31 , healthcare assistant @entity32 , said yesterday : ‘ it was chaotic in the ward for the hour between 2pm and 3pm			2
she said she had been left to deal with ' anxious ' parents virtually by herself			0
ms @entity32 said : ‘ another female patient had absconded and her parents were very anxious			2
‘ i went looking for her with a student nurse			0
i reported her missing but senior nursing staff in the office were not interested			2
‘ they were quite jolly , eating chocolates and cake			0
’ she told the hearing she had to go back three times before she got a response			0
the other missing patient was found elsewhere in the ward within a few minutes			2
the healthcare assistant said she was also left to attend to an angry father whose son , returning to the ward after leave , did not have a bed			0
ms @entity32 admitted she filled in the head count sheet and incorrectly marked that ms @entity1 was on the ward at 3pm and 4pm and admitted making those mistakes as she was recorded on @entity3 leaving the ward at 2.25pm			1
she said she correctly marked her absent each hour from 5pm until she finished duty at 9pm			0
but ms @entity32 admitted that she ignored procedure and did not report ms @entity1 missing to registered staff at the first opportunity			1
she said : ‘ i had seen her dressed to go out earlier in the day and assumed she was going on accompanied leave			0
delayed information : @entity66 @entity65 told the inquest a police search was hindered because of faulty record - keeping and delays in raising the alarm after ms @entity1 's body was found at @entity13 , @entity14 ( pictured ) ‘ i kept presuming she was off the ward			1
i do n't think i told anyone at the end of the shift			0
‘ i presumed a senior member of staff would have known			0
’ she said she did not know the woman was sectioned after a suicide attempt at @entity13 just over a week earlier			2
the hearing was told the alarm was not raised until 10.20pm , when ms @entity1 ’s parents phoned the ward anxious about her safety and it was discovered she was not there			1
@entity66 @entity65 told the inquest a police search was hindered because of faulty record - keeping and delays in raising the alarm			1
he said : ‘ because of the wrong time on the log , officers scanned the cctv to obtain a description of what she was wearing from 5pm onwards instead of from 2.25pm			0
’ he said the delay in raising the alarm had lost ' daylight searching ' time as @entity14 police were not alerted until after midnight , 14 hours after ms @entity1 had absconded			1
the hearing had previously heard a number of accepted practices and policies had not been transferred by the @entity17 staff to the @entity106 when it opened in december 2011			0
@entity17 senior manager @entity107 told the inquest she was satisfied that if all those practices and policies had been implemented , including staff abiding by their own professional standards , that ms @entity1 would had been safe			1
she said if monitoring procedure had been followed correctly , a search would have been started at 3pm that day			0
ms @entity107 agreed with ms @entity1 's father , @entity116 , that , given the way the ward was being run at the time , his daughter could not have been protected			1
