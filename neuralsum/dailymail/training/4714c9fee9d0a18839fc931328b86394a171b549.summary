by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 10:36 est , 18 december 2012 newly crowned @entity2 @entity1 is to be offered a knighthood - but there are huge doubts about whether he will accept it			1
it has been recommended the @entity10 winner and @entity12 gold medallist be placed on the @entity13			1
wiggins and three other stars - sailor @entity16 , @entity18 cyclist @entity17 and @entity18 track star @entity19 - will be asked to become sir or @entity21 on january 1 , it has emerged			1
icon : @entity1 was crowned @entity2 on sunday and is set to be offered a knighthood - but will he take it ? great moment : @entity26 of @entity28 hands over the famous trophy to ' @entity30 ' as smiling @entity31 and @entity32 watch on popular : ' @entity30 ' has become a @entity34 hero and won @entity35 in a landslide win backed by 500,000 votes from the public but 32 - year - old @entity39 ' @entity30 ' has hinted he may shun the honour as he is uncomfortable with ' hierarchy and status '			1
this would fly in the face of huge online campaigns and support from the prime minister - all desperate for him to become sir @entity1 after his sparkling year			2
he won sports personality in a landslide victory backed by almost 500,000 public votes lodged in just 35 minutes on sunday			0
after the victory he was asked if it was the perfect end to his year and he replied : ' yeah , it is			0
there ’s only the knighthood to come , is n’t there , really ? '			0
letting his hair down : @entity1 clings to a male pal outside @entity59 looking slightly worse for wear after a few drinks on sunday night fun : @entity1 and his wife @entity63 both enjoyed his victory at the @entity65 on sunday the day job : @entity67 is now one of @entity34 's most famous men because of his sporting excellence , winning the @entity70 this year and collecting gold at @entity39 2012 - one of seven @entity12 medals in his career big win : @entity34 went wild when @entity1 won the men 's @entity75 on day five of the @entity77 but the badboy of @entity34 sport , sometimes seen swearing at photographers , stumbling out of nightclubs drunk or having a cheeky cigarette , may turn it down			1
in his autobiography my time he wrote : ' during the @entity77 , there was speculation about whether i might end up with a knighthood in the same way sir @entity91 did after his great year			1
' people asked me about it , so i did wonder whether i would accept it if it were to come my way			0
' i can never see myself being given a title like sir @entity1			0
i have never considered myself above anybody else			0
i have always struggled with hierarchy and status			2
romp : @entity67 won gold medal by a huge margin and showed his superiority as the world 's top cyclist cool customer : @entity1 sits on the throne as he celebrates winning gold and is known to be uncomfortable in the spotlight ' i do n’t know what it is – maybe just my upbringing , the area i ’m from – but i ’m quite happy to play second fiddle			0
' i understand my physical capabilities sometimes give me status but , when it ’s all done and dusted , i struggle with that kind of thing			1
' it ’s not what happens to kids from @entity124			0
' well known : the @entity126 rider is also well known for his love of music and particularly the @entity129 @entity1 shown here playing guitar at the sports personality after party seven time @entity12 medallist @entity1 has a cbe from 2009 , @entity16 , who has medals from five consecutive @entity12 , including four golds in a row also has a cbe			1
@entity34 sports icon @entity1 said today that winning @entity2 topped off a perfect 2012			2
he won with 500,000 votes - more than the number of people who voted for all the candidates in 2011			0
' that 's ( @entity2 ) is an institution and to be voted by the @entity34 public was incredible			2
it topped off the year , ' he said			0
' it was a great moment and to have @entity147 and @entity31 there to give me the award was just amazing			0
' @entity19 has an obe and won four golds in ten days this summer while @entity153 has an incredible 22 @entity18 medals in swimming and cycling including four golds at @entity77			1
this quartet are viewed as perfect for the top honour the @entity160 can bestow			2
but @entity161 , who orchestrated the much - loved @entity162 has also be offered a knighthood , but may also turn it down			1
the success of @entity77 has been so huge that many who played a big part will be recognised			2
this means that the usual quota system , which only allows one sporting great to be made sir or @entity21 , will be torn up this year			1
government rules saying that sportsmen and women can only be handed four cbes , 20 @entity175 , and 38 @entity176 will also be steamrollered			0
great moment : decorated sailor @entity16 won his fourth straight gold at @entity77 and could soon become sir @entity16 iconic image : paralympic star @entity19 celebrates winning @entity180 during the men 's 800m and won four events in total this summer - he too could soon be knighted sporting great : @entity17 claims gold in the @entity186 individual @entity185 , equalling icon @entity187 and @entity17 could now become a @entity21 this is because during the @entity12 there were 29 gold medallists and 35 @entity18 gold medallists and 185 gold , silver and bronzes across both events this summer			1
it is rumoured there are so many sporting winners this time they will have their own list within the @entity201 ' list			0
but @entity34 cycling and @entity126 coach @entity203 will also become sir as will @entity206 chief @entity205 before he joins the @entity207 as a peer .			2

tour winner and seven - time @entity12 medallist to be recognised by the @entity160 on january 1
but star cyclist has spoken of his problem with ' hierarchy and status ' and admits he would ' struggle with that kind of thing '
@entity13 will have separate @entity77 section
@entity16 , @entity19 and @entity17 likely to become sir or @entity21
limits on knighthoods , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 for sporting greats to be ignored to mark great year for @entity34 in 2012
but opening *ceremony* mastermind @entity161 *reported* to have turned down knighthood
