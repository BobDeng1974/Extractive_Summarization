by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:15 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 9 september 2013 jailed : but @entity2 now says it was the media 's fault he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice shamed cabinet minister @entity2 has blamed the @entity7 for sparking the speeding points scandal which led to the end of his political career			1
the former @entity11 , who was jailed for eight months in march for perverting the course of justice , claims a ‘ new media aggression ’ has become ‘ a problem for us all ’			1
in an audacious return to the public eye , he accused two newspapers of targetting him , first to expose his affair with an aide and then to reveal he had passed off speeding points to his wife @entity23			1
and he appeared to suggest his law - breaking and cheating were only exposed because he spoke out against phone - hacking			1
the speeding points revelation saw @entity2 , 58 and @entity23 , 60 , appear in court in an acrimonious trial in which intimate details of the breakup of their marriage were aired			1
sentencing the couple in march , mr @entity33 said ‘ any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault ’			2
the judge told @entity2 : ‘ despite your high office you tried to lie your way out of trouble by claiming you were innocent , by repeating that lie again and again during your extensive interviews by the police			1
’ the former politician - who one day dreamed of leading the @entity11 - has previously admitted he ‘ lied and lied again ’ to avoid the truth			2
but @entity2 has now gone on on the offensive , accusing ‘ the @entity51 press ’ of targetting him because he called for the police to reopen the voicemail hacking inquiry			1
giving his account on the scandal for the first time since he was released from prison , he claimed the now - defunct @entity59 tailed him to expose his affair with his aide @entity61 , 46			2
he also accused another of @entity51 ’s papers , the @entity64 , of having ‘ groomed ’ his wife to reveal how she had taken three penalty points for him before the breakup of his marriage			1
and he blamed the wider press of a ‘ new media aggression ’ for undermining how voters view politicians			2
ex-wife : @entity2 convinced @entity23 to accept speeding points on her licence even though he was driving writing in the @entity76 , he urged politicians to ‘ combat concentrations of power ’ in the media - including that of mr @entity51 , who ‘ has used his media muscle to bulldoze a way for his business interests ’			1
he said : ‘ my own behaviour has not helped , and i am not proud of that			0
it is an explanation , but not a defence , to point out that the @entity89 ’s pollsters say 300,000 people have swapped speeding points and that it seemed like a minor matter back in 2003			1
‘ i should not have done it			0
the personal consequences were monstrous for my family and me , including two months in prison			0
’ but he added : ‘ the @entity59 sparked the end of my marriage , but another @entity51 title , the @entity64 , then groomed my ex-wife until she told them about the speeding points			1
‘ the political editor bought dinners , sent flowers , offered breaks at smart hotels , and reassured her that she would not face any unpleasant consequences ( such as prison )			0
’ he went on to write : ‘ the moral of this story ? first , none of this would have been possible without my own mistakes			0
i am no saint ( but nor did i claim to be )			0
‘ second , politicians now have to live with a 24 - hour media , which is more intrusive and hurtful for the people they love , and this is having a corrosive effect on how the public view politicians , and politics itself			2
‘ ultimately , the new media aggression is not just a problem for those individuals directly affected , it is a problem for us all			0
’ couple : @entity2 's marriage collapsed when the @entity7 revealed he was having an affair with @entity61 in a radio interview this morning @entity2 went further , claiming he was a victim of a conspiracy by the @entity51 empire to further the media mogul 's business interests			1
he said the @entity59 had known about his affair before the 2010 general election but delayed publication until a month after polling day ' when at that time @entity51 was , of course , trying to get approval to buy the rest of @entity142 '			0
but the story was also exposed on the same day by the @entity145 newspaper , and as @entity146 had no role to play in media regulation			0
@entity2 told @entity150 's today programme : ' you know , you would have thought if they knew that i was lying before the election then that ’s the time when they should have run the story			2
' so i think the very clear implication here , just by the coincidence of when the investigation starts , the fact the story is not then run until substantially later suggests that there is another agenda			0
' i ’m saying very clearly i take responsibility for my own mistakes i would not have been vulnerable if i had not things which i regret and were clearly wrong			0
' but what i am pointing out , from i suppose a rather unique vantage point , is sometimes newspaper groups and media groups have their own interests as well			0
' @entity51 in particular is exceptionally powerful and over many , many years he has played the person rather than the issue and he has also used that political influence to bulldoze a way for his business interests			0

@entity2 admitted perverting the course of justice after asking then - wife @entity23 to accept speeding points for him
but now he says the scandal was down to a @entity7 *vendetta* against him
@entity188 papers targetted him *due* to phone - hacking scandal
