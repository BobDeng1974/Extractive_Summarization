it is a measure of how far @entity1 has come in a very short space of time that he should be chosen for the front cover of this year ’s @entity5			1
this time last year he was just one of the many promising emerging players about to be given a chance in an @entity11 team forced to start again in the wake of their @entity14 humiliation			1
now he is a significant figure in cricket and culturally , having first proved to be a role model for @entity19 @entity18 and then showed what an exciting cricketer he is with both bat and ball			0
@entity11 all - rounder @entity1 has been revealed as the 2015 @entity5 front cover star @entity1 has shot to prominence for the @entity27 since making his international debut last february @entity1 appears on the cover of the @entity5 @entity1 knows what it means to be highlighted by the cricket bible			1
it would be no surprise if @entity35 , @entity5 editor and @entity37 cricket writer , selects him as one of his five cricketers of the year when the almanack is released in april			1
‘ it ’s gone very quickly , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it ’s been a really good year and hopefully there will be a few more for me with the @entity11 team			1
‘ somebody sent me the @entity5 picture and it ’s really nice			2
it ’s an honour to be on the front of it			0
i have a couple of copies from the past and my dad ’s definitely going to get the new one			0
’ it would be even better received if @entity5 is published on the back of a productive @entity57			2
@entity1 is proving himself just as important to the one - day team as the test one now , being preferred to @entity60 as the man given licence to get @entity11 off to a flying 50 - over start			1
he scored a hundred as opener against @entity66 before @entity67 and he put on @entity11 ’s first century opening stand for two years with @entity68 against @entity69			2
‘ i do n’t think i played that well in @entity70 , ’ he said			0
‘ i struggled a bit early on but because @entity72 was going so well i did n’t have to do anything stupid — even though i did in the end ! ‘ i did n’t have rhythm and i tried to force it a bit			0
@entity72 said , “ it ’ll come , it ’ll come , ” but i gave it away and hopefully i can learn from it			0
’ @entity1 's spin bowling will be key if @entity11 are to do well at the @entity57 held in @entity69 and @entity82 @entity1 and @entity68 put on 113 vs @entity69 - @entity11 's first three - figure odi opening partnership for two years @entity1 ’s off - spin proved far more effective in test cricket last summer than envisaged , taking 19 wickets against @entity87 , and he is proving a quick learner in the one - day game			1
now it seems that he will be first - choice spinner and @entity91 will be consigned to the sidelines			0
‘ i ’ve started off quite well with the ball , trying not to go for too many runs , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ if i bowl flight to these guys they ’ll murder it so i try not to give too much air			0
but when conditions are right with a bit more spin i ’ll look to attack a bit more			0
’ @entity11 must beat @entity87 at the @entity103 on friday to qualify for the @entity105 final against @entity69 .			2

@entity1 will be the front cover star for the 2015 @entity5
@entity1 only played his first international game for @entity11 last february
