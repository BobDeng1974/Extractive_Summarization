disgraced former minister @entity0 has been caught breaking the traffic laws yet again , by driving the wrong way up a one - way street			1
pictured in his @entity4 , he edged out of a narrow side road and , risking yet another three points on his licence , turned right instead of left			1
even allowing for @entity0 ’s famed hubris , the timing of his latest transgression , revealed for the first time today , is remarkable			2
against the tide : @entity0 illegally turns right out of @entity14 , on to one - way @entity15 , his blue @entity4 travelling the wrong way mid-manoeuvre : the one - way sign clearly shows mr @entity0 has been breaking the law as he exits @entity15 , turning right on to @entity21 it happened just four weeks before his trial , at which he admitted asking his former wife @entity25 to take speeding points for him in 2003			1
in other words , it was at a time when one might expect him to have exercised granny - like caution behind the wheel			2
but as the events of the past few weeks have demonstrated , @entity0 ’s regard for the rules of the road – and the laws of the land in general – can be decidedly casual			1
along with miss @entity25 , he now faces a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice			1
the one - way infraction happened on january 11 on a street two minutes from mr @entity0 ’s £ 1.25 million home in @entity45 ’s fashionable @entity44			1
he left his flat and headed for @entity14 , a narrow road which he used to cut through to @entity15 , where he executed the illegal right turn			2
four days later , his lawyers were in court battling without success to get the speeding points case thrown out			1
then , just as the trial was due to start , @entity0 changed his plea to guilty			2
@entity54 accomplished : but is that a guilty look on mr @entity0 's face as he drives off into the @entity45 traffic ? uneasy rider : @entity0 can be seen cycling on the pavement near @entity60 , @entity45 , left , and making a right turn while ignoring a traffic sign on the same day he was pictured driving the wrong way down a one - way road drivers in his @entity45 borough who break the one - way rule face a £ 130 fixed penalty fine on the spot , if caught on camera , reduced to £ 65 if they pay within 14 days			1
however , if caught by a police officer , they can face a charge of careless driving and the possibility of three penalty points			1
if @entity0 , 58 , had been lost in an unfamiliar city , his behaviour might have drawn some sympathy			2
but having lived in @entity44 for more than a year with new partner , @entity79 , he is thought to be familiar with the streets in his vicinity			1
especially as he often cycles in the area			0
not that he is necessarily any safer on two wheels			0
on the same day he was pictured driving his car the wrong way along a one - way street , he had earlier ignored a no - right - turn sign while cycling in the @entity60 area , in breach of the @entity91			2
and last year he was also photographed cycling the wrong way along a one - way road			0
in his defence , when mr @entity0 committed his latest driving offence there were no signs in @entity14 warning him not to turn right			0
nor was there a sign opposite the @entity14 entrance indicating he should turn left into @entity15			0
new signs have been put up since the incident , however			0
and here he does it again , this time on a bike : mr @entity0 is pictured cycling the wrong way down a on - way road near his home last february disrespect for the law : the disgraced former mp @entity0 has admitted asking his former wife @entity25 , pictured right , to take speeding points for him in 2003 the seeds of @entity0 ’s recent downfall were sown in 2003 when a speed camera caught his @entity114 doing 69mph on a 50mph stretch of the @entity116			1
with nine points already on his licence , he asked @entity25 to claim she had been driving			1
but he still got a ban			0
just 16 days later , he was caught using his mobile telephone while driving , and disqualified for six months			0
two years later , after he was appointed @entity122 environment spokesman , he traded in his cherished @entity114 for a ‘ greener ’ @entity4			0
@entity25 , 60 , was last week found guilty of perverting the course of justice by taking speeding points on @entity0 ’s behalf			1
the judge warned the pair faced jail			0
last night mr @entity0 said there was n’t a ‘ no right turn sign ’ in @entity14 at the time of the incident			0
‘ i suggest there was no offence , ’ he said , adding : ‘ i have n’t obviously turned right there since the sign was put up			0
’ but on january 11 , there were two one - way signs at either end of @entity15			0
and @entity142 has confirmed @entity15 has been a one - way street for years			2
mr @entity0 added : ‘ until that right turn sign was erected , it [ making an illegal right turn ] was a very common thing for residents to do because apart from anything else they could n’t get through [ nearby ] @entity150			0
’ his comment suggests that if he had turned left , his path would have been blocked , but it would only have meant him taking a longer route			0
hearing : @entity25 ( left ) and her the ex-husband , @entity156 's former energy secretary @entity0 ( right ) , will be sentenced together for perverting the course of justice on monday afternoon - and probably face jail			1

infraction happened on a street two minutes from the former minister 's £ 1.25 million home in @entity44 , @entity45
was just four weeks before he admitted asking his former wife @entity25 to take speeding points for him in 2003
