' then she got him on the floor and turned on the clippers			2
it was so funny watching her because his hair was quite long and she was ragging his hair out and looked like she was having so much fun			2
' we all had a really good giggle and it was the first time we ’d seen her properly giggle in weeks , it had certainly been a very long time			1

she even told us not to be upset because her hair would soon grow back			0
