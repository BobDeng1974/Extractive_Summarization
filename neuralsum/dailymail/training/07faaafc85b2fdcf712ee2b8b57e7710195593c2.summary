by @entity0 it 's an important moment in any courtship – when a woman first claps eyes on her boyfriend ’s bachelor pad			2
will it be clean and tidy ? will it be decorated with any semblance of taste ? @entity11 need n’t have worried when she set foot inside her future husband @entity14 ’s flat for the first time			2
with its stylish vaulted ceilings and vast kitchen / living room , @entity21 , 34 , a marketing executive at auctioneers @entity23 ’s , could n’t have failed to be impressed			2
banker @entity14 , 30 , might also have pointed out that the flat played a role in the @entity26			1
it is on the fourth floor of a former factory called the @entity30 , in @entity31 , @entity32 , that used to make parts for @entity35 fighters and @entity37 bombers			1
ultimate bachelor pad : the two - bedroom @entity32 apartment is on the market for £ 925,000 what ’s more , the building was converted into a residential block by architect sir @entity44 – who designed @entity32 ’s @entity46 building on the @entity47 at @entity48			1
he was so pleased with the @entity30 that he now lives in another of the apartments			0
the couple are reluctantly selling @entity14 ’s ultimate bachelor pad for £ 925,000 as they want a family - orientated home			1
the @entity30 was built in the 1920s and was one of the first all - concrete buildings in @entity59			1
it was originally owned by @entity60 and used to construct whole houses via timber transported along the nearby @entity63			0
when the @entity65 began in 1940 , the government requisitioned the building to house the @entity68 ’s aeroworks , which was producing parts for @entity71 warplanes in the heavily targeted @entity72			1
classic work : the @entity30 was built in the 1920s and designed by @entity46 building architect sir @entity44 spacious : the master bedroom in the flat in @entity32 's @entity31 war jet : the former factory in @entity80 , @entity32 , used to make parts for @entity82 ( pictured ) and @entity37 bombers since the surroundings were residential rather than industrial , it was less likely to be a priority target for @entity89 bombers			1
braking systems , tyres , wheels and gun turrets were made in the factory but , owing to the secrecy of the operation , the workers were never told what they were going to be used for			1
anyone passing the building today would be left in no doubt about what was once going on inside this @entity104 block			1
there are seven spitfire models on the roof and a plaque to commemorate the @entity68 ’s production of the legendary fighter			0
sir @entity44 is a particular fan of the @entity35 , saying it inspired him as a design icon			1
‘ the @entity35 continually evolved throughout the war , ’ he has said			1
‘ by 1945 it was 30 to 40 per cent faster than at the beginning			0
that strikes a chord with my approach to architecture – evolving and innovating , but remaining true to the original spirit			0
’ nothing could demonstrate this more than the @entity30 itself and @entity21 and @entity14 ’s two - bedroom flat			1
moving out : @entity11 , 34 , and her future husband @entity14 , 30 , are selling the flat to more to a more ' family orientated ' home the design exploits the building ’s generous dimensions – the rooms are airy and spacious and feature a uniform style of clean lines and white finishes			2
the couple agree that @entity21 merely ‘ softened a few edges ’ when she moved in			0
‘ as a space to live in , the flat could n’t work better – there are two evenly sized bedrooms and a great area for lounging or eating in , ’ says @entity14			0
‘ the spare room ’s great for extra rent if you need it , or for a child or just somewhere for your other half to keep her clothes			0
’ the couple will particularly miss the area , which is not renowned for family - size houses but is cosmopolitan – it ’s a stone ’s throw from the @entity155 with its @entity157 restaurants			2
it ’s also very convenient for the centre of @entity32 , and @entity14 and @entity21 say they love having the canal and @entity162 so close			0
@entity163 , sales manager at @entity166 ’ @entity165 branch , said : ‘ this apartment represents industrial chic at its very best			2
‘ it is just so characterful and would be an ideal space for an individual who likes something that is very much out of the ordinary			0
‘ the space has so much recent history that it must be unique among @entity32 ’s housing stock , and the fact that it is home to one of @entity32 ’s leading contemporary architects adds huge interest			0
’ @entity181 , 020 7993 3050			0
