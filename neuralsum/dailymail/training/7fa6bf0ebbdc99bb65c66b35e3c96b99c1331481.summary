a @entity8 engineering firm has unveiled an flying ' car ' that is a quick as a @entity11 but can also take to the air			0
the @entity13 is being billed as ' part buggy , part aircraft ' and claims to be the ' ultimate recreational vehicle '			1
it is described as ' part buggy , part aircraft ' and claims to be the ' ultimate recreational vehicle ' @entity24 : 115mph 0 - 60mph : 4.3 secs @entity25 : 55mph takeoff speed : 37mph @entity27 : 35mph maximum altitude : 15,000ft restricted altitude : 10,000ft range : 200miles weight : 420kg it is powered by a one litre @entity34 engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque , which gives the unusual vehicle a 0 - 60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range @entity38			1
however , the buggy would lag behind in a drag race against the more traditional @entity42 sports car , as its top speed of 115mph is considerably slower than the @entity11			2
when in the air , the ' car ' uses paraglide technology to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft , although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres , which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds the @entity13 is powered by a one litre @entity34 engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque , which gives the unusual vehicle a 0 - 60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range @entity38 however , the vehicle can take off and fly at 55mph in the @entity13 goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields , grass strips and secluded beaches			1
when in the air , it uses paraglide technology ( a large parachute - like wing ) to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft , although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres , which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds			1
the cockpit of the @entity13 ( pictured ) has a sleek computer interface to control the vehicle instead of ' distracting dials , switches and fiddly buttons , ' the company said the @entity13 goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields , grass strips and secluded beaches the car is built from light - weight materials including carbon fibre and weighs 420 kilos			1
it uses a propeller to get off the ground and power the craft in the air			0
the @entity34 engine achieves take - off at just 37mph			0
lift is provided by the large relex paraglider wing , which works in the same way as a conventional paragliding chute			0
once in the air , the paraglider wing absorbs turbulence to keep the ' car ' stable to ' provide a safe and comfortable flight '			0
in the unlikely event of an engine failure , the @entity13 floats to the ground using its paraglider , or can also rely on a ballistic reserve chute if there is a problem with the wing			0
engineers claim the @entity13 is capable of 53 miles - per - gallon on land which gives it a 500 mile range but this is slashed to 200 nautical miles in the air			1
the vehicle was designed by a company based in @entity115 in @entity116 called @entity117 and can be flown by anyone with a driving license after they complete 12 hours of flight with a certified flight instructor			1
@entity123 , @entity13 's founder and ceo , said : ' this vehicle will change the way people experience their world and provide pure enjoyment of flight			0
' imagine driving an all - terrain vehicle that can convert from road to air mode in three minutes - with @entity13 , that dream has become a reality			2
' the new machine will make its global debut at this week 's @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity140			0
it is expected to cost around £ 75,000 with deliveries beginning next year			1
the vehicle was designed by a company based in @entity115 in @entity116 called @entity117 and can be flown by anyone with a driving license after they complete 12 hours of flight with a certified flight instructor because of its relatively simple cockpit ( pictured )			2

engineers at @entity117 in @entity116 designed the ' part buggy , part aircraft ' that can go from 0 - 60mph in just over four seconds
it can fly at a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet and has a top *airborne* speed of 55mph after *transforming* from a land buggy in three minutes
the @entity13 is expected to cost around £ 75,000 with deliveries beginning next year
