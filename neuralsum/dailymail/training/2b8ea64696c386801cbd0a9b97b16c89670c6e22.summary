the most senior judge in @entity1 and @entity2 has rejected calls for specialist courts to deal with cases of child sexual exploitation but judges will be handpicked by a specialist panel sex offence trials involving vulnerable children are to be conducted by a team of specially vetted judges , the lord chief justice said yesterday			1
the small group of highly experienced judges will also undergo ‘ bespoke training ’ to help protect weak and exposed child witnesses , lord judge said			1
his decision to introduce tighter restrictions on the list of judges who can run the most sensitive and potentially brutal sexual exploitation cases was sent to mps on the @entity25 , who expressed concerns recently over the way some trials were conducted			1
the move follows deepening alarm at the treatment of children by lawyers and judges in cases involving paedophilia charges and alleged sex gangs			1
lord judge said the new rules will apply to the choice of judges who sit in serious sex cases in which one of the witnesses is regarded as ‘ significantly vulnerable ’ and is expected to give evidence ‘ in circumstances that call for especially sensitive handling ’			1
the system will also operate in cases that involve a number of defendants and are expected to go on for more than ten days			2
judges in such cases are already chosen from a list of trained and experienced judiciary who are supposed to be versed in methods of stopping defence lawyers from subjecting child witnesses to ‘ oppressive ’ cross examination			1
but lord judge told committee chairman @entity63 that while he thought the system worked ‘ extremely well ’ , he accepted that there were a ‘ very few cases in which valid criticisms have been made of the treatment of vulnerable witnesses ’			1
the move is in response to concerns about how young people are cross-examined during cases under the new system , judges will be on the sex case list only if they have been approved by the @entity78 , who is in charge of a regional circuit of courts , and the resident judge , who is the chief judge at the @entity83 involved			1
the senior presiding judge , @entity84 , will have final approval of ‘ the limited number of judges who are likely to be selected to try these cases ’			1
a judge will be picked from the list for each case that qualifies			2
there will also be bespoke training from the @entity94 , the body responsible for training judges and providing guidelines on how to conduct trials			2
this will ‘ focus particularly on how best to conduct trials involving significantly vulnerable witnesses , as well as addressing the undoubted difficulties posed by multi-defendant trials ’			0
lord judge also promised updated guidelines on how to conduct trials and named three senior judges who will try to find ways of protecting children who give evidence			1
judge @entity108 , who earlier this year gave life sentences to five @entity111 men who abused girls as young as 11 , will act as mentor to judges on the sex case list			1
judge @entity116 will take part in @entity119 talks on fighting child sex abuse , and deputy chief magistrate @entity121 is already running a scheme to try to ensure cases with very young witnesses come quickly to trial			1
but lord judge rejected the idea of sending child sex trials to special courts			1
he said that could have unintended consequences , including high expense and long waiting times because of the limited numbers of courtrooms , judges and court staff			1
a victim was abused by a gang of @entity140 men from the age of 13 then had to endure a harrowing cross-examination in front of her abusers in court ( picture posed by model ) by @entity148 she was a damaged and vulnerable teenage girl , who had been ‘ passed around and used as meat ’ by a gang of @entity140 men since she was 13 years old			0
then she had to spend 12 days in the witness box , facing cross-examination from defence barrister after defence barrister , until she finally broke down			0
her friend , who was also sold for sex by the men , had an even more horrifying experience , and ended up sobbing as she gave evidence			2
jurors were visibly angry and dismayed at the aggressive tactics of one particular lawyer			0
another barrister walked out of court in disgust			0
their appalling treatment , in a case that critics say shamed @entity173 justice , prompted yesterday ’s moves to provide child victims of sex abuse with greater protection in criminal trials			1
the girls gave evidence in two trials , and at both they were cross-examined by barrister @entity182			2
in the summer of 2011 , seven men from @entity184 went on trial at @entity186 accused of turning young white girls into ‘ sexual commodities ’ , who were trafficked and sold to dozens of men			1
among the defendants was @entity192 , who was represented by mr @entity182			0
in the original trial the first girl , by now aged 18 , was cross-examined by a succession of defence lawyers			1
some of them challenged her evidence in a methodical way but others were far less restrained			0
during aggressive questioning , @entity201 - based mr @entity182 accused her of ‘ telling lies ’ , giving ‘ phoney evidence ’ and being a ‘ very dishonest girl ’			0
he even asked her whether she repented her ‘ sins ’			0
next the girl ’s friend , now aged 19 , gave evidence			0
mr @entity182 accused her of being ‘ very wicked ’ and making ‘ false and malicious allegations ’			0
he then went on to question her about an incident unconnected to the men on @entity213 she was 13 , she had confided in her mother that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather			0
her mother called the police and the girl initially gave a detailed statement			0
but , as she explained to the jury , she withdrew it a day later because she was concerned about the impact on her mother			0
at times shouting at the girl , mr @entity182 used it to argue that her evidence in court could not be trusted			2
his method was to force the sobbing teenager to read statement containing her original allegations against her stepfather out loud			0
the girl was distraught , jurors were shaking their heads , and concerned judge @entity235 asked whether it was necessary			2
mr @entity182 said it was			0
after more complaints he agreed to read out lines from the statement himself , but the teenager ’s distress continued			0
the trial eventually collapsed and was split into a series of retrials			2
twelve months later , the second trial of the crown v @entity192 began at the same court with a new judge , @entity249 , in charge			1
judge @entity251 made his opinion of the conduct of the original trial clear			1
‘ the way things went last time is just so wrong that we should all be ashamed that our justice system allowed it , ’ he said			2
the two girls were again witnesses but mr @entity182 ’s questioning took a different course			0
before mr @entity182 cross-examined the second girl the judge warned him that he would not be allowed to repeat the distress caused at the previous trial			1
he rebuked the barrister when he attempted to delve into the incident involving the girl ’s stepfather			0
the judge asked him : ‘ is it difficult for you to understand that she finds all this troublesome and embarrassing and it has nothing to do with the case ? ’ at the end of the second trial , mr @entity182 ’s 25 - year old client was found guilty of rape , 11 counts of sexual activity with a child , inciting child prostitution , inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and meeting a child after sexual grooming			2
@entity192 was jailed for 18 years			0
mr @entity182 has said that he was doing his professional duty .			0

senior judges will have to approve the trial judge for all serious sex cases
response to concerns about how young people are cross-examined
however , lord chief justice rejected calls for specialist centres
