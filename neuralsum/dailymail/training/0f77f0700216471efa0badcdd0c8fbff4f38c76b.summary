dirty stethoscopes may be helping to spread dangerous bugs around @entity4 surgeries and hospital wards , a study suggests			1
one of the instruments was found to be more contaminated with bacteria than the palm of a doctor 's hand after being used to examine 71 patients			2
among the microbes spreading from patients was the potentially deadly superbug @entity15 ( methicillin - resistant @entity16 )			1
dirty stethoscopes may help to spread bugs around gp surgeries and hospital wards , a new study suggests dr @entity21 , from the @entity22 on patient safety at @entity24 in @entity25 , said : ' by considering that stethoscopes are used repeatedly over the course of a day , come directly into contact with patients ' skin , and may harbour several thousands of bacteria ( including @entity15 ) collected during a previous physical examination , we consider them as potentially significant vectors of transmission			1
' from infection control and patient safety perspectives , the stethoscope should be regarded as an extension of the physician 's hands and be disinfected after every patient contact			1
' dr @entity21 's team conducted a study in which 71 patients were examined by one of three doctors using sterile gloves and a stethoscope			0
after each examination , the tube and diaphragm of the stethoscope and four regions of the physician 's hands were checked for bacteria			0
the stethoscope 's diaphragm , the part of the instrument that is pressed onto a patient 's skin , was more heavily contaminated than all regions of the hand except the fingertips			2
in addition the stethoscope tube was covered in more bugs than the back of the doctor 's hand			0
one of the bugs found on stethoscopes is the potentially deadly superbug @entity15 ( pictured ) the study , published in the journal @entity78 , is the first to make a direct comparison of bacterial contamination of hands and stethoscopes			1
however , if a report published last month is to be believed , doctors will soon be hanging up their stethoscopes for good			2
a medical mainstay since 1816 , they are being elbowed out of the way by new technologies such as ultrasound which has only been about since the 1950s			0
mobile devices are becoming increasingly popular , accurate , smaller to the point of being handheld and cheaper to make			0
however , professor @entity93 , editor of the journal @entity95 , said : ' at the time of this writing several manufacturers offer handheld ultrasound machines slightly larger than a deck of cards , with technology and screens modelled after modern smartphones			0

among the microbes found on stethoscopes is the superbug @entity15
*experts* say that they should be disinfected after each patient
some recent reports have suggested stethoscopes will soon be a thing of the past as more modern devices *replace* them
