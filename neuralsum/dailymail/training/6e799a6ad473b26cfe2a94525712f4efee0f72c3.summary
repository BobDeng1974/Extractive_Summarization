@entity1 ’s new kit contract has led to serious repercussions for @entity3 , the @entity5 cricket team and rugby ’s @entity6			1
all three have lost backing from adidas because of their £ 750million investment in supplying @entity1 shirts from next season			1
@entity13 were not prepared to renew their shirt agreement with @entity3 because of the increased cost , while the @entity5 cricket partnership has been greatly downgraded and might end early			1
and the @entity18 company have announced they will be ending their 18 - year association with the @entity6 — despite replica shirts selling so well			1
@entity1 's adidas deal will begin next season , ending their association with @entity23 @entity3 has already had his ties to adidas cut - the @entity24 is now with @entity28 firm under @entity29 the massive price of winning the @entity1 deal from arch - rivals @entity23 has meant adidas have had to re-evaluate the importance of other properties , with their funding focused on the core activities of football , fitness and running			1
@entity28 firm @entity29 , with whom @entity3 signed when adidas did not meet his numbers , are also favourites to take over the @entity6 contract for the next tour to @entity43 in 2017			1
the @entity44 has always put on the best pre-match show in the @entity46			0
but their impressive laser display last friday night can not be emulated by @entity49 2015 as it will be only dusk when the @entity51 opening ceremony finishes at @entity52 around 7.30pm on september 18			2
instead they will utilise the pitch itself in way that does n’t jeopardize the playing surface when @entity5 take on @entity58 half - an - hour later			2
the atmosphere at the @entity44 was crackling with the pre-match pyrotechnics before the match you ca n’t get away with anything on social media , even if a tweet is more than two years old			0
a screen grab of foul - mouthed @entity72 rugby co-commentator @entity67 ’s response from january 2013 — after being told by an astute armchair rugby viewer that he turns the sound off because of @entity70 — was retweeted hundreds of times during @entity5 ’s win in @entity75 on friday			1
the loveable @entity70 ( above ) wrote : ‘ use the red button for the alternative commentary , you thick t * * *			2
’ @entity72 would n’t comment			0
@entity70 - former @entity5 international - was caught out as @entity82 users retweeted an old comment the signs are pointing to the @entity85 getting £ 4billion from their seven tv packages , which are all expected to go to a second round of bidding today			1
@entity89 , @entity90 and the @entity91 are thought to be competing , with @entity92 a possible contender as well			0
but the way first picks for games involving the top clubs have been contained within the four packages that @entity89 are hell - bent on retaining might be the subject of contention			0
however , the @entity85 say they have spread the picks more equitably in the latest tender			0
@entity104 's @entity103 there was a clear subtext to @entity107 accusing @entity109 media of dramatising the serious crowd violence that interrupted the @entity112 semi-final between @entity113 and @entity114			1
@entity107 said : ‘ when something bad happens in @entity117 , they say it ’s an error			2
when something happens in @entity120 , they begin talking about corruption			2
’ it ’s safe to infer that @entity107 knows he will not get the @entity124 vote in may ’s presidential election and instead wants to shore up support from @entity120 by currying favour at every opportunity			1
@entity107 ( right ) , pictured presenting the @entity112 2015 trophy to @entity131 's @entity130 on sunday meanwhile , @entity18 newspaper @entity132 has alleged that lawyers acting for @entity107 removed some critical passages from governance committee chairman @entity136 ’s report into @entity139 structures			1
before @entity136 ’s findings were made public last year they were sent to @entity141 , @entity139 ’s director of legal affairs , to ‘ check the facts ’			0
but @entity145 ’s 37 comments also asked for word changes and deletions regarding @entity107 ’s conduct that were agreed by @entity136 , whose report shows the president in a remarkably good light			0
@entity139 say it is normal procedure			0
even when @entity155 is back fulfilling his media obligations he likes to stir the mix. so he told @entity158 after @entity160 ’s win at @entity161 that he likes them because they ‘ do not ask for players to be banned ’ — a clear reference to @entity89 after the @entity164 stamping incidents			0
@entity155 was a @entity89 ambassador when he called their coverage ‘ special ’			0
now he ’s a well - remunerated @entity90 representative .			0

@entity13 have not renewed their shirt agreement with @entity3
the @entity5 cricket team and the @entity6 will also both lose adidas backing after @entity1 's £ 750million backing
@entity49 commentator @entity70 was caught out by an old tweet , in which he swore at a user commenting on his broadcasting
@entity107 is trying to shore up support from @entity120 by currying favour
