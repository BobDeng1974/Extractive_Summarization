by @entity0 published : 21:00 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 16 february 2013 a hunt for dozens of @entity2 thought to have been buried in the @entity4 jungle has proved fruitless			1
last month , archaeologists spent nearly two weeks trying to unearth unused unassembled aircraft which they believed were packed into crates and buried by the @entity8 in 1945			1
but they failed to find any spitfires at @entity10 , now @entity10			1
archeologists spent two weeks hunting for the spitfire planes in the @entity4 jungle the aircraft were thought to have been delivered to @entity14 during @entity15 some 36 planes were thought to be lying undiscovered in @entity10 - one of three potential locations in the country - with as many as 124 buried in total			1
but @entity20 , who were funding the project , today said they believe no @entity2 were delivered in crates and buried at @entity10 during 1945 and 1946			1
the company said that archival records showed that the @entity8 unit that handled shipments through @entity29 docks only received 37 aircraft in total from three transport ships between 1945 and 1946			0
none of the crates contained spitfires and most appear to have been re-exported in the autumn of 1946 , they said			0
evidence also pointed to appalling weather conditions leaving a shortage of equipment , timber and labour at @entity10 around the time meaning it would have been impossible for the @entity8 to bury aircraft 30ft deep in wooden crates even if it wanted to , according to @entity20			2
wing commander @entity48 , with @entity49 for film @entity50 in 1968 @entity52 , @entity20 's director of special projects , said : ' no - one would have been more delighted than our team had we found spitfires			0
' we knew the risks going in , as our team had spent many weeks in the archives and had not found any evidence to support the claim of buried spitfires			2
' however , the team 's assessment was that even if there were no crated @entity2 , parts of @entity2 or other aircraft might well have been found , since @entity67 was a major airfield occupied by three different air force and hundreds of service people during @entity15			0
' @entity61 been found we were equipped to recover them using the best available technical expertise			0
and we would have done the work to the same high ethical and archaeological standards which we brought to the rest of the project			0

archeologists spent nearly two weeks trying to find 37 unused spitfires in the jungle
they were thought to have been delivered to @entity10 , no @entity10
it now is *n't* clear if they were ever sent to the country
