how will you remember the 2014 @entity1 ? asked by @entity3 to sum up the tour after their @entity6 defeat at @entity7 on sunday , @entity2 settled for : ‘ overall , good			1
’ and , if you ignore the bad bits , he was spot on			0
@entity2 ’s was the logic of the sportsman , for ever filleting away to pick out the negatives and serve up a dish that wo n’t stick in the gullet			2
@entity16 , you see , won a test match at @entity18 and walked the one - day series			1
three years ago in @entity21 , they failed to win an international game of any description			2
so , yes , it was a progress of sorts			0
but ‘ overall , good ’ ? in 2011 , the margins of @entity16 ’s four test losses were 196 runs ( lord ’s ) , 319 runs ( @entity30 ) , an innings and 242 ( @entity7 ) , and an innings and eight ( @entity33 )			1
this summer : 266 runs ( the @entity34 ) , an innings and 54 ( @entity36 ) , and an innings and 244 ( @entity33 )			0
spot the difference – if you can			0
in 2014 , @entity2 ended up pleading inexperience , which suggests something went badly wrong with the succession planning			2
which tour was the more gruesome ? @entity58 , 2011 : @entity16 lost the @entity59 4 - 0 and the one - dayers 3 - 0 ( plus the solitary @entity6 )			1
but @entity21 back then were a better team			2
the side bounced out by @entity61 at @entity18 in july was the most shambolic i ’ve reported on in a decade and a half – even more so than the two sets of @entity66 whitewashees			0
in 2011 , @entity21 were preparing to become the no 1 test team in the world			1
this summer , they were there for the taking			0
their captain could not score a run , they had no spinner and no wins in 10 tests			0
bread and butter : @entity16 swatted @entity21 aside in the @entity78 , which is @entity2 's favourite form of the game caught out : but @entity2 's lack of fight in tests outside @entity16 was again exposed by @entity21 this summer for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin			1
the @entity86 is now taking a few weeks off before returning in time for @entity21 ’s one - day visit to @entity88 in november			1
it was time for @entity16 to go for the jugular			2
and so , on the first day at @entity91 , @entity2 sat back and invited @entity21 to nudge their way to 247 for 2			1
pulse - racing it was not			0
but it allowed @entity95 and @entity96 to progress at a pace designed to ease @entity21 back into the series : no frills , no risks , just plenty of defensive fields and easy singles			1
it was red - ball cricket played with a white flag			0
as much as @entity107 ’s drop of @entity95 at third slip when he was 15 runs into his restorative 95 , @entity21 were galvanised by the vibes emitted by @entity2 ’s caution			1
there was no stopping them after that			0
alternative : @entity115 has his critics , but the flamboyant batsman could be a the next @entity1 @entity59 captain once that series was over , i asked @entity1 fans on @entity121 whether victory in the one - day series would make up for defeats in the @entity59			1
the overwhelming majority said it would not , which was one in the eye for those who claim @entity1 fans are damagingly obsessed with white - ball cricket			0
yet it was the logic that appeared to inform @entity2 ’s ‘ overall , good ’			2
he deserves some latitude : post-match interviews on podiums are not usually the forum for captains to reveal their darkest thoughts			0
but the whole edifice collapses if we do n’t take at least some pronouncements at face value			0
for @entity2 , then , a 3 - 1 victory over an @entity142 one - day side which will continue to fall short of its potential while @entity95 is in charge was a face - saving balancing act to @entity16 ’s 11 days of awfulness in the final three @entity59			1
it is like a failing opera singer attempting to claw back credibility in the karaoke booth			0
it strikes this outsider that @entity1 cricket can do better			0
i do n’t buy the argument that @entity16 try harder in one - day internationals than they do in @entity59			1
trying not very hard is the easiest accusation to make in sport – and the hardest to prove			0
but those grim tactics on the first day at the @entity34 suggest the problem may nevertheless be a question of attitude			0
at home , @entity2 has won 21 tests out of 30 ; away , it is six out of 28 ( and three of those wins were in @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 )			2
not all of this can be ascribed to the seaming ball			0
if @entity2 loses three of the four tests in @entity177 later this year – who would bet against it ? – he will become the most defeated captain away from home in the history of the game			1
with the quality of the batsmen at his disposal , this is a scandal			0
in truth , this tour has n’t told us much we did n’t already know : @entity2 is a poor @entity59 captain outside @entity16 , where he is too easily resigned to his fate , but a good one - day leader in any part of the world			1
his apologists say there is no alternative , though no - one seriously imagines @entity115 will endure a worse test series than this one			1
it would also be a surprise if @entity115 ’s test captaincy was as supine as @entity2 ’s			1
@entity1 cricket wo n’t cure its away - day blues until @entity2 is asked to concentrate on his batting			1
it goes without saying he should continue as one - day captain , a format that evidently excites him			1
but @entity16 ’s test fortunes can hardly get any worse under a new leader			2
how will this column remember the 2014 @entity1 ? overall , predictable			0
@entity212 boo boys it ’s always especially dim when spectators boo players			2
it was dim when @entity142 fans booed @entity219 in 2009 , and when they booed @entity107 this summer			0
the best that could be said about both acts is that they were fuelled by the logic of the masses : @entity219 was the captain of the arch - enemy , while @entity107 had been involved in a contretemps with @entity227			0
but what of the recent booing aimed by @entity1 fans in the direction of @entity232 ? what act had he committed , real or pantomime , that merited the derision ? if there is a better explanation than his ethnicity , we ’d be happy to hear it			0
leave him alone : @entity232 was the subject of mindless booing from some supporters at @entity7 a glimpse into a soul on sunday , @entity2 turned down two singles in @entity251 ’s final over – and @entity16 lost by three runs			1
if that sounds like a simplistic summation , then it may also provide an insight into @entity2 ’s pre-eminence , both in his own dressing - room and , possibly , his own mind			2
was a last - ball six off his bat really more likely than a last - ball four off the bat of the talented @entity263 ? and what message did @entity2 ’s i ’ll - do - this - myself - thanks approach send to his team - mates ? still , as confirmation that cricket reveals the inner man better than any other sport , his decision was invaluable			2
captain @entity40 might @entity40 ’s return to pyrotechnical form at @entity7 help @entity21 ’s selectors see that their only chance of winning the @entity279 will be to have exciting hitters all the way down the order ? @entity21 made a very late change to the team that ended up winning the @entity6 in the @entity285 , drafting in @entity286 and @entity287 to open the batting in place of @entity290 and @entity291			1
since the @entity279 will be preceded by a seven - match series in @entity88 and a triangular tournament in @entity177 , there is still time to thank @entity95 for his time and tell him to go away and rest up for 17 tests in nine months			1
it may be @entity21 ’s only chance			0
something to shout about : @entity40 's return to form with the bat is a big boost for @entity21 @entity304 hails ' outstanding ' @entity21			1

@entity21 easily beat @entity16 in test series 3 - 1
@entity16 gained revenge by winning @entity78 series by same margin
but one - day success does not mask @entity16 's @entity59 *underachievement*
@entity2 must take *responsibility* for supine *performances* away from @entity16
@entity115 is potential **replace*ment* as @entity59 captain
spectators who booed @entity232 at @entity7 are dim
@entity40 should *replace* @entity95 as @entity21 's odi captain
