a supermassive dinosaur measuring 85ft has been discovered by scientists			2
the skeleton of the @entity3 , seven times bigger than @entity5 , is also the most complete skeleton ever found of its type , with more than 70 per cent of its bones - excluding the head			1
because all previously discovered supermassive dinosaurs are only known from partial remains , @entity10 offers an unprecedented window into the largest animals to ever walk on @entity15			1
gentle giant : the new supermassive dinosaur ( artist 's impression , pictured ) measured 85ft ( 26 metres ) long and weighed around 65 tons when it was alive , say scientists dr @entity22 , associate professor at @entity24 's @entity23 , who discovered the fossil , said : ' @entity27 was astoundingly huge			1
in may scientists in @entity29 revealed they had found the fossilised bones of the biggest dinosaur of all time			1
scientists believe the species of titanosaur weighed in at 170,000 pounds , as heavy as 14 african elephants			1
a local farm worker found the remains which were captured by the @entity39 's @entity38			0
the fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the @entity43 , led by dr @entity44 and dr @entity45 they unearthed the partial skeletons of seven individuals - about 150 bones in total - all in ' remarkable condition '			1
according to the measurements of its gigantic thigh bones , the herbivore would have been 130ft ( 40m ) long and 65ft ( 20m ) tall			0
' it weighed as much as a dozen african elephants or more than seven @entity5			1
' shockingly , skeletal evidence shows that when this 65 - ton specimen died , it was not yet full grown			1
' it is by far the best example we have of any of the most giant creatures to ever walk the planet			0
' the fossil skeleton was found in southern @entity67 in @entity29 according to the journal @entity69 from the @entity70			2
the new dinosaur belongs to a group of large plant eaters known as titanosaurs , and the fossil was unearthed over four field seasons from 2005 through to 2009			2
more than 100 elements of the @entity10 skeleton are represented from the type specimen , including most of the vertebrae from the 30 - foot ( nine metres ) long tail , a neck vertebra with a diameter of over a yard ( 0.9 metres ) , scapula , numerous ribs , toes , a claw , a small section of jaw and a single tooth			2

here the articulated tail of @entity27 is pictured the skeleton that was unearthed was found 70 per cent complete with a 30 - foot ( nine metres ) long tail , a neck vertebra with a diameter of over a yard , a scapula , numerous ribs , toes , a claw , a small section of jaw and a single @entity108 paleontologist @entity22 is pictured with the right tibia ( shin bone ) of @entity10 most notably for calculating the animal 's mass , nearly all the bones from both forelimbs and hindlimbs including a femur over six feet ( 1.8 metres ) tall and a humerus , were also present			1
a smaller dinosaur with a less - complete skeleton was also unearthed at the site			2
before the discovery of @entity10 , another @entity67 giant , @entity121 , held the title of dinosaur with the greatest calculable weight at 47 tons , based on a recent study			1
' @entity127 are a remarkable group of dinosaurs , with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale or more , ' said dr @entity134 from the @entity135			2
' but the biggest titanosaurs have remained a mystery , because , in almost all cases , their fossils are very incomplete			0
' an artist 's impression of of two @entity27 shows them menacing a smaller meat - eating dinosaur			0
@entity144 was an herbivore that likely spent much of its life eating massive quantities of plants to maintain its enormous body size the @entity153 laser scans of @entity10 show the deep , preserved muscle attachment scars that can provide a wealth of information about the function and force of muscles that the animal had and where they attached to the skeleton			2
dr @entity22 said : ' with a body the size of a house , the weight of a herd of elephants , and a weaponised tail , @entity10 would have feared nothing			1
' that evokes to me a class of turn - of - the - last century battleships called the dreadnoughts , which were huge , thickly clad and virtually impervious			0
' as a result , dr @entity22 chose the name ' @entity144 , ' meaning ' fears nothing			1
' ' i think it 's time the herbivores get their due for being the toughest creatures in an environment , ' he added			0
@entity144 lived approximately 77 million years ago in a temperate forest at the southern tip of @entity188			0
here , a pair of bones called a ' chevron , ' are pictured			0
these bones occur along the bottom of the tail dr @entity22 said : ' with a body the size of a house , the weight of a herd of elephants , and a weaponised tail , @entity10 would have feared nothing			1
dig and skeleton , pictured the species name , ' schrani , ' was chosen in honor of @entity207 entrepreneur @entity206 , who provided support for the research			2
to grow as large as @entity144 , a dinosaur would have to eat massive quantities of plants and researchers say it would be like having ' a life - long obsession with eating '			0
@entity144 lived approximately 77 million years ago in a temperate forest at the southern tip of @entity188			0
until now the biggest titanosaurs have remained a mystery , because , in almost all cases , their fossils are very incomplete			0
paleontologist dr @entity22 , is pictured next to @entity223 's femur ( femur ) dr @entity22 added : ' every day is about taking in enough calories to nourish this house - sized body			1
i imagine their day consists largely of standing in one place			0
' you have this 37 - foot [ 11.3 metres ] long neck balanced by a 30 - foot [ nine metres ] long tail in the back			0
without moving your legs , you have access to a giant feeding envelope of trees and fern leaves			0
' you spend an hour or so clearing out this patch that has thousands of calories in it , and then you take three steps over to the right and spend the next hour clearing out that patch			0

an associate professor in @entity247 has found a fossil belonging to an ' astoundingly huge ' dinosaur
the skeleton of the @entity10 schrani is seven times bigger than a @entity5 and the dinosaur weighed more than a @entity256 plane
it is a species of titanosaur , among the largest dinosaurs to walk on @entity15
and it is also one of the most complete skeletons found , with more than 70 per cent of its bones found
but lead researcher dr @entity22 says the behemoth , which weighed 59,300kg or about 65 tons , was not even fully grown when it died
