by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political reporter published : 16:14 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 16:15 est , 26 october 2013 criticised : @entity3 came under fire last night over the £ 7million plan for classrooms in @entity7 speaker @entity3 came under fire last night over a £ 7million plan for classrooms in @entity7			1
he is backing plans for a new education centre dubbed ‘ @entity12 ’ to encourage thousands more schoolchildren to visit the @entity14			1
but the centre , earmarked for land next to the @entity17 overlooking the @entity18 , will cost £ 1 million a year to run on top of the £ 7million building costs			1
and some mps say the scheme can not be justified while taxpayers are still tightening their belts			2
@entity26 mp @entity25 , parliamentary aide to @entity26 chairman @entity27 , said : ‘ squandering this amount of taxpayers ’ money on classrooms is outrageous			0
' at a time when @entity7 itself is reducing its running costs , it is beyond belief			0
’ the speaker last night hit back , with officials saying the education centre idea has already been ‘ unanimously ’ backed by key mps			1
the row erupted after the @entity14 finance committee – meeting behind closed doors – was shown detailed plans for the education centre			1
mps heard it involved building a classroom complex next to the @entity49 , complete with a new security entrance			0
it would be a temporary structure because the entire @entity17 could be refurbished in 10 years ’ time and the centre might need to be relocated			1
the aim is to more than double the current 45,000 - a - year visits to @entity7 by schoolchildren and students			2
but three @entity26 mps present at the finance meeting asked to be recorded as opposing the plan			0
concern : mps @entity25 , left , and @entity64 , right , have questioned whether the project is justified the @entity1 understands that they thought it was a ‘ nice idea ’ – but also argued it was inappropriate when @entity7 itself was cutting its budget			2
the mps have declined to comment but mr @entity25 , who is not a member of the finance committee , openly said the project should be ditched			0
@entity74 mp @entity64 , former chairman of the @entity75 , also questioned whether it was justified			0
he said : ‘ i support improving facilities for schoolchildren			0
but when services to @entity70 themselves are being cut back , we have to review going ahead with this scheme			1
’ last night , a spokesman for mr @entity3 said the principle of creating a dedicated education centre had already been ‘ unanimously approved ’ by the ruling @entity86			1
he said the plan would allow an extra 55,000 young people a year to visit @entity7			0
the spokesman said : ‘ involving and enthusing young people in this way is key to addressing currently low levels of democratic engagement			0
’ the row comes after mr @entity3 enraged @entity26 mps last week by rebuking @entity95 after he called @entity96 ‘ a conman ’ at @entity98			2
however , other mps insist mr @entity3 was right to rule that mr @entity95 ’s ‘ conman ’ jibe was unparliamentary .			2

@entity3 is backing plans for the new £ 7million education centre
it is earmarked for land next to the @entity17 , near the @entity18
@entity70 say the scheme can not be justified in the current *economic* *climate*
