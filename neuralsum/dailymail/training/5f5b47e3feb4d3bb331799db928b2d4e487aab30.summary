she said : ‘ i was playing in the hospital children 's play area and got stuck in a plastic car - i began to panic and did n't know how on earth i was going to get out			2
but while trying to free myself my back twinged and i felt pins and needles in my legs - a sensation i had n't had in months			1
' i was convinced i 'd never walk again - i could n't feel my legs			2
giving up and spending the rest of my life in a wheelchair was the easiest thing to do			0
but that was it then , i got pins and needles and i could finally feel my legs again			1
’ she spent almost a year in hospital recovering from her severe injuries			0

‘ it 's just an unimaginable thing to happen and to be confined to a wheelchair just strips you of the ability to do so many things			0
’ @entity3 - who has bipolar disorder - was transferred from @entity4 's @entity60 to @entity62 's @entity61 to begin her rehabilitation treatment			1
during her recovery : the teenager spent almost a year in hospital recovering from her severe injuries			0

' i was convinced i 'd never walk again - i could n't feel my legs ' @entity3 - @entity73 @entity3 said : ‘ it was tremendously difficult to keep going			1
there was a time where i just completely gave up and believed it would just be easier to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair			0
‘ but with support from nurses , trained specialists , family and friends i became more focused and determined to achieve something special			0
’ @entity3 was gradually able to rebuild her strength through gruelling rehabilitation and physiotherapy sessions - even using rock climbing , because she could use her arms to do what her legs could not			1
getting better : after her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer , @entity3 set her sights on her first major challenge since her accident and completed a @entity98 ( left ) after her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer , @entity3 set her sights on her first major challenge since her accident and completed a @entity98 5km ( 3.1 - mile ) @entity98			1
' doctors told me that i would eventually be okay but i just could n't believe them ' @entity3 - @entity73 @entity3 said : ‘ i completed it on crutches , i want to achieve something to be proud of			2

she was doing so with @entity111 , 15 , who has recently undergone operations on both his feet			0
@entity3 has raised more than £ 500 for @entity114			0
click here to sponsor her			0
@entity117 dr @entity116 told @entity118 : ' the most obvious reasons ( for her recovery ) would be when she fractured her spine she actually compressed her spinal cord - though radio - logically ( on x-ray and scan ) this looked severed , and she was told she would never be able to use ( her legs ) again			2
' so when she got stuck in the toy car , her struggling moved the compressed vertebrae to move enough to release her spinal cord - and hence her feeling and use of her legs came back			1
this is much more likely than a regrowth of nerve tissue			0
