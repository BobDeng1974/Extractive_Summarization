the @entity5 study , released tuesday , found that about 20 per cent of @entity3 say they have no religious affiliation , an increase from 15 per cent in the last five years			1
scholars have long debated whether people who say they no longer belong to a religious group should be considered secular			2
while the category as defined by @entity5 researchers includes atheists , it also encompasses majorities of people who say they believe in @entity48 , and a notable minority who pray daily or consider themselves ' spiritual ' but not ' religious '			2
still , @entity5 found overall that most of the unaffiliated are n't actively seeking another religious home , indicating that their ties with organised religion are permanently broken			0

five years of changing beliefs : atheism and agnosticism is growing at the expense of @entity30 @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 : church buildings are a staple of @entity107 life , but attendances are plummeting no @entity24 nominees are @entity9 : @entity24 nominee @entity111 , for example , is @entity112 neither agnostic or atheist : the rise of the ' nothing in particular ' the @entity5 analysis , conducted with @entity118 ' ' @entity117 ' , is based on several surveys , including a poll of nearly 3,000 adults conducted june 28 - july 9 , 2012			1
the finding on the @entity9 majority is based on responses from a larger group of more than 17,000 people and has a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points , @entity5 researchers said			1
@entity5 said it had also previously calculated a drop slightly below 50 percent among @entity3 protestants , but those findings had fallen within the margin of error			1
the @entity137 , which is conducted by the @entity139 's @entity138 , reported for 2010 that the percentage of @entity3 @entity9 was around 46.7 percent			1

' in some parts of the country , there is still a stigma			0
but overall , it 's not the way it used to be			0
' the @entity5 study has found the growth in unaffiliated @entity3 spans a broad range of groups : men and women , college graduates and those without a college degree , people earning less than $ 30,000 annually and those earning $ 75,000 or more			1
