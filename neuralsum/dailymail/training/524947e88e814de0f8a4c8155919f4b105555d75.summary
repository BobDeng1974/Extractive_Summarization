given the contrasting fortunes of the sides in recent times — palace on the back of four wins since @entity0 took over and @entity7 with just one victory in 13 — the visitor ’s early lead was a shock			1
only two minutes were on the clock when @entity27 was played down the right and had time to power in a low ball			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity25 could only palm the cross into the sliding @entity21			1
he was lucky , the ball cannoned off his knee and went in			0
three minutes later , parity was almost restored when @entity49 cleverly flicked the ball past @entity111 in @entity7 ’s goal			1

he opted to throw them all into the melting pot which resulted in early @entity3 pressure , despite going behind			2
but @entity0 ’s hand was forced 21 minutes into the match , regardless of his intentions , when @entity50 leapt to head the ball and instead smacked into the back of @entity61 ’s skull			1
blood spurted from @entity50 ’s nose and his face and hands were covered in claret as the striker was carried off on a stretcher			0
‘ he ’s got a broken nose , we fear , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ fingers crossed he does n’t get my cold			0
he was n’t concussed , but it was a heavy blow to the nose with a cut on it as well			0

they almost added to their lead on 78 minutes when @entity68 played an angled ball between defence and goalkeeper and @entity21 came sliding in again but could not connect with the ball			2
with three minutes remaining , @entity68 then bent an effort towards the left corner of the goal but @entity25 pulled off a diving , one - handed save			2
‘ we do n’t live in a hermetic chamber , ’ said manager @entity16			0
‘ we know we ’re playing catch - up in the league			0
