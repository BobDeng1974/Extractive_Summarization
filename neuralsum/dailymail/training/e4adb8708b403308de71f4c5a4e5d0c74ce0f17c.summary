@entity0 has dismissed shadow business secretary @entity1 as ' @entity2 ' at a @entity4 conference event			1
lord @entity0 made the baffling remark after being asked what he thought about modern @entity4 politicians , and the speeches they make			1
for reasons known only to the former deputy prime minister , he likened mr @entity1 to the anarchic 1990s band who famously poured a bucket of ice cold water over him at the @entity16			1
his tub - thumping address closing the gathering was not to be missed			0
but in recent months his interventions have become increasingly difficult to fathom , and have left the @entity4 leadership baffled and frustrated			2
last night the 76 - year - old was appearing on stage at the @entity33 in @entity34 , being interviewed by comedian and former @entity4 adviser @entity36			1
@entity36 asked : ' do you find it difficult ? ... when you are watching people do speeches , like ... @entity1 ? ' lord @entity0 added : ' i keep making a mistake of calling him @entity2 so i get into all sorts of bloody trouble			1
' @entity45 's in fashion and it certainly was when i went to whatever it was and chucked it over me			0
' it 's a new voice , he actually expresses the details , he 's an intelligent guy putting across the case			0
' but he does sound a bit quiet does n't he ? you do n't walk away saying , ' @entity55 , we 're now on the way '			0
'' you 've got to do somehow do that , and that 's when the raucous and passion ... passion is still an important part of politics			0
' where are the awkward buggers going to come from ? those awkward buggers have had experience			0
' the @entity4 grandee was drenched by @entity2 frontman @entity67 at the @entity68 when he poured a bucket of ice cold water on him			2
lord @entity0 was famously drenched by @entity2 frontman @entity67 at the 1998 @entity16 when the group announced their split in 2012 , @entity0 took to @entity73 to express his delight			2
he wrote ' @entity75 ? ' and said he would mark the moment by going to buy their greatest hits album			0
last night 's wide - ranging interview also covered topics like the 2003 invasion of @entity82 , the threat of @entity84 and the infamous punch in 2001 when he lashed out after being hit in the face with an egg			0
but it is the latest in a growing list of bizarre interventions from @entity0			2
yesterday he tried to criticise the government 's welfare reforms , including @entity4 's attack on the so - called bedroom tax			1
but he instead declared : ' we will repeal the breakfast tax			1
' and earlier this month he turned up to a campaign speech in @entity99 with the name of the cross-party campaign against independence scrawled on the back of his hand			0
on a campaign visit to @entity99 this month , @entity0 appeared to have been given instructions not to forget to mention the cross-party @entity108 - with reminders on his notes and even the back of his left hand the @entity4 bruiser was supposed to take the fight to the @entity115 in defence of the 300 - year - old @entity117 , but instead launched a bizarre attack on the @entity119 , told a story about buying whiskey at an airport and boasted of being @entity123			1
the former deputy prime minister also set out a bizarre idea to merge the @entity127 and @entity99 football teams to ' beat the @entity128 '			1
oddly , the more eccentric elements of the speech appeared to have been planned in advance , with numbered notes written in thick black pen on a series of white cards			0
he told a large crowd of supporters : ' here 's a revolutionary thought for you , perhaps if @entity127 and @entity99 together had one team we could at last beat the @entity128			2
' he also suggested @entity4 voters were not clever enough to understand the arguments about independence , leading one senior party source to brand him a ' f * * * * * * moron '			2
mr @entity1 has come up against other @entity4 big beasts in recent weeks			0
yesterday @entity152 revealed @entity153 gave the @entity4 rising star the ' hairdryer treatment ' in a blistering phone call after the shadow business secretary publicly blamed him for @entity4 's struggles on the economy			1
mr @entity153 attacked the shadow cabinet minister for an interview he gave criticising the former @entity4 leader 's failure to confront @entity165 's ballooning deficit in the run up to the 2010 election			1
mr @entity1 said mr @entity153 's refusal to even talk about @entity169 ' cuts ' was still costing @entity4 support , because it made the party look like it did not care about the deficit			1
@entity4 are currently 25 points behind the @entity119 on which party is best for the economy .			0
