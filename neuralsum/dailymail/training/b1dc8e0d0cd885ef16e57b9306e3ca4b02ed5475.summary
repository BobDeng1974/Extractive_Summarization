@entity0 is adamant only the strongest will be able to aim for glory on friday evening			1
those without the necessary fortitude risk being swept aside amid a maelstrom of emotion			2
the @entity7 legend anticipates the atmosphere inside @entity9 with an almost salivating relish			2
he will be confined to the relative sanctuary of a television studio , but admits he dreams of still being young enough to step out of the tunnel and into the white - hot battle			2
@entity0 views this @entity16 qualifier as just about the ultimate test of mentality			1
an international encounter imbued with all the passion , intensity and significance of any great club rivalry			2
@entity0 feels @entity24 is tailor - made to influence the showdown with @entity26 the potential is there for heroes to be born , for careers to find a defining moment			1
but there is also , @entity0 warns , the capacity for the occasion to overwhelm those not ready for what lies in wait			1
he does not see it being a game decided by the tactical scheming of @entity40 or @entity41			1
rather this will be football in its most gladiatorial form			2
‘ it ’s about adapting to what will be an explosive atmosphere , just incredible , ’ insisted @entity0			1
‘ i ’m going to be there for @entity50 and all of us are absolutely anticipating the energy and emotion that will fill the place			2
‘ what team deals with it best and keeps their heads will be a big factor			0
‘ it ’s going to be a cauldron of fear if you let it go that way , or a cauldron of energy if you let it help you along			0
‘ those who are stronger - willed and stronger - minded will come out on top			0
but i ’ m finding it very hard to decide which team is going to do that			0
@entity75 striker @entity74 ( right ) could have an impact off the bench ‘ i see this as a different kind of game to any in the group so far			2
it ’s not a normal @entity84 qualifier			2
‘ it is nearer @entity86 , @entity87 or @entity89 v @entity88 - that kind of intense derby occasion			0
it ’s difficult to stress the importance of this match			0
it is about more than qualifying			0
it builds real passion and patriotic pride			0
‘ whereas a lot of training for big qualifiers centres around getting videos of the opponents and maybe dealing with their @entity105 or whatever , this comes with a totally different outlook			0
i think tactics will be secondary aspect			0
‘ it is man v man , like a throwback to the kind of games we had in the past			0
’ @entity116 happen to have a man who has become iconic for doing that latter feat. @entity24 will be in the hunt for , quite remarkably , his 66th international goal when he returns to @entity9 following a prolific loan spell in 2010			1
now 34 , @entity24 remains an essential part of @entity41 ’s plans having flattened all manner of records over the course of 137 caps			1
the hat - trick he netted against @entity129 last month made him the highest scorer in the history of @entity133 qualifiers			0
@entity0 , second on @entity136 ’s goals list , is awestruck by @entity24 ’s relentless consistency and feels he is tailor - made to influence the showdown with @entity26			1
‘ @entity24 obviously knows @entity9 well and he will love the atmosphere - full stop , ’ enthused @entity0 , who partnered @entity24 up front in the 2002 @entity142 finals			1
former @entity136 striker @entity0 will cover the @entity16 qualifier for @entity50 ‘ the bigger the atmosphere , the bigger the game , the more he can use his experience			1
‘ he can call upon all those positive things , memories of scoring there in the past and so on , to give himself the edge			0
‘ @entity24 is a national treasure			1
he has done something extraordinary in his career , just phenomenal			0
‘ it beggars belief at times when you look at every other @entity7 goalscorer , including myself , and the amount of games we played			0
‘ he has got a hold of this record and driven it to a place where none of us mere mortals could dream about			0
’ @entity24 has warmed up for @entity170 in some style , scoring one and setting up three in @entity174 ’s 5 - 0 rout of @entity175 on sunday evening			1
being resident in @entity177 has not diminished any of his desire to represent his country			0
‘ when he went to @entity181 , people did ask if he would hold onto his place or whether others playing regularly in @entity184 could come in and take over , ’ reflected @entity0 ‘ one or two flattered to deceive , but @entity24 has seen them all off with his enthusiasm			1
’ @entity26 manager @entity40 relishing @entity136 clash at @entity9 @entity74 is one of those left on the fringes by @entity24 ’s evergreen effectiveness			1
@entity0 was @entity191 chairman when @entity74 played on @entity192 – and fell foul of manager @entity194 for off - field disciplinary issues			1
‘ listen , @entity74 always had quality , ’ insisted @entity0			1
‘ he was great for @entity198 ’s youth team then things got a bit more difficult for him			0
but he has knuckled down since and seems to be doing very well for @entity75			0
‘ to be honest , i ’d have hoped he ’d have amassed more caps than he has done			0
he needs to get himself into that @entity136 team			1
‘ but that is the beauty of a game like this			2
if , at 0 - 0 , @entity24 comes off after an hour then those on the bench have to be ready			2
‘ @entity74 has to believe there is a goal in him if he gets the chance – and work so hard in training that @entity41 points to him if a change is needed			1
’ @entity0 feels @entity26 ’s opening display in @entity215 set the standard for a group he regards as by the far the toughest in the entire qualification process			2
friday night now represents the most crucial staging post yet			0
‘ if someone comes away with three points , it is a huge advantage and a crushing blow for the loser , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i think i ’ll probably dream about playing in it a few nights this week			0
whether you a @entity229 guy under @entity40 or an @entity7 guy under @entity41 , you are under managers who have team spirit at the maximum			1

@entity136 legend @entity0 views @entity16 qualifier as huge mental test
he does not see it being a game decided by the tactical scheming of @entity40 or @entity41
@entity24 will be in the hunt for his 66th international goal
