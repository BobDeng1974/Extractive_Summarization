by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 16 march 2013 as a @entity9 arts minister , @entity3 college master and chairman of the @entity5 , the flamboyant lord @entity6 was renowned for his erudition , wit and irrepressible social skills			0
but the urbane dandy also applied his keen mind to more practical financial matters – as @entity16 can reveal that he secretly entered into a civil partnership with his long - term partner to avoid paying inheritance tax			2
the politician arranged the ceremony with @entity22 to keep the taxman from taking 40 per cent of his £ 3.3 million estate			1
@entity25 : lord @entity26 ( left ) , who died last march at 82 , entered into a civil partnership with his partner of more than 50 years @entity22 , 77 , ( right ) to avoid a 40 per cent tax on his £ 3.3m estate although they kept their relationship discreet , they were partners for more than 50 years			1
but they decided to tie the knot only when they realised they would get a tax break			0
last night , mr @entity22 , 77 , a former banker , said : ‘ when we saw the tax advantages of a civil ceremony the decision was elementary			1
‘ i know some people do these things because they want their partnership to be recognised by law , but ours was to avoid the 40 per cent fee			2
there was no pomp and circumstance , it was very modest			0
‘ normally one would have to go to a proper licensed building , but we had it at our flat because i am not very mobile since suffering a stroke			0
’ lord @entity26 with @entity58 , who he nicknamed ' the @entity59 ' speaking at the £ 2 million @entity61 penthouse they shared until the peer ’s death last march at 82 , mr @entity22 added : ‘ there are those who are afraid to reveal they are in same - sex partnerships because they are concerned other people will look upon them negatively , but our reason was because we felt a private life should remain private			1
‘ people who knew us were already aware we were partners – it becomes pretty obvious once you have lived with someone for 50 years			0
’ the couple met 57 years ago when lord @entity26 – then @entity26 – taught mr @entity22 law at @entity78			1
lord @entity26 would later follow a political career , becoming arts minister and @entity81 under @entity58 – but was one of the first @entity9 ‘ wets ’ to be sacked in 1981			2
he is said to have coined the prime minister ’s nickname @entity86 – from the initials of her mantra ‘ there is no alternative ’ – and also called her ‘ the @entity89 ’ and ‘ the @entity90 ’			0
he was known for affecting the manner of a fey @entity95 aesthete , such as lapsing into @entity96 and mispronouncing modern words			0
the civil ceremony took place on november 19 , 2009 , the same month lord @entity26 drew up a will with mr @entity22 as the main beneficiary			1
had they not become partners in the eyes of the law , his estate would have been taxed at 40 per cent on everything above the £ 325,000 threshold – leaving a potential bill of up to £ 1.2 million .			2
