when questioned , @entity2 lied to detectives and told them he had not been to the house since his friends had vacated it			2
but yesterday , at @entity45 , he was found guilty of stealing the goods			2
during the trial , mr @entity13 said he could n’t ‘ comprehend ’ what he was seeing when he made the discovery			2
‘ it took a minute to sink in and then i realised the whole kitchen was missing , ’ he said			0
‘ it was total disbelief			0
‘ it was so awkward because i could n’t work out how or why it had happened			0
‘ but the only other person who had keys was mr @entity2			2
’ mrs @entity7 said they had been shattered by the actions of a man they had considered ‘ a really good friend ’			2
she said : ‘ we ’re a family just trying to live our lives			0
you put your trust in someone and this is what happens			0
‘ if you ca n’t put your trust in someone like @entity2 , who can you trust ? ’ before : mr and mrs @entity7 's kitchen in the £ 310,000 home they had lived in for five years after : £ 6,500 worth of kitchenware was stolen by former @entity38 man @entity75 @entity2 , from @entity77 , @entity36 , first met the @entity78 in september 2011 to give them mortgage repayment advice after their house had failed to sell			1

the businessman , who runs mortgageforce in @entity35 , also suggested the pair took anything of value out of the house			0
however , the @entity78 told the court this was untrue and explained they could not bring themselves to gut the kitchen			0
when the tradesmen entered the property to take the goods , they used keys given to @entity2 by mrs @entity7 on the understanding they would be passed on to the mortgage provider			1
