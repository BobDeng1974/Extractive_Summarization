lined with barbed wire , guarded by soldiers wearing riot gear and with tanks waiting nearby , this is perhaps not the welcome @entity6 refugees were hoping for as they fled across the @entity8 border from @entity9			1
but for now this is the safest place for the thousands of men , women and children to be as hoards of @entity16 militants descend on their home town of @entity18			1
@entity20 - led airstrikes and soldiers from the @entity6 peshmerga have managed to hold the brutal @entity23 extremists back for now , but there are fears they could still take the town			0
if that happens , many @entity27 fear they will be massacred in the same way the @entity30 were after @entity16 fighters seized @entity32 last month , forcing them to flee into the hills			1
dressed in a battered suit , his moustache flecked with grey , he is distraught about having to leave , but fears what would have happened to him if he had stayed			0
' i do n't want to be in @entity8 , i want to be in my village , i want to die in @entity18 , ' @entity64 said , running prayer beads through his hands as he watched @entity6 and @entity49 fighters exchange fire in the valley below			1
' he added : ' if the war goes our way , then of course we 'll go home , but it looks like it will be difficult			0
' @entity8 , already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from @entity9 's civil war , is pushing the @entity20 and its allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside @entity9 territory			1
a safe haven along the border would require a no - fly zone policed by foreign jets			1
president @entity91 , until now reluctant to commit to a frontline military role in the @entity20 - led campaign against @entity49 , has said @entity8 troops could be used to help set up such a zone			1
meanwhile , @entity8 has deployed riot police at the @entity96 crossing gate near the @entity9 border in the southeastern town of @entity43 to stop @entity9 refugees entering @entity8			1
show of force : @entity8 has massed troops and tanks close to the border and says it may be willing to help set up a safe zone for refugees inside @entity9 ready for action : @entity8 has been reluctant to commit troops to the conflict in @entity9 , but has changed its stance after 1.5million refugees flooded across the border assault : @entity20 - led airstrikes have kept @entity16 militants away from the town of @entity18 , on the @entity8 border , so far - but there are fears it could still fall to the radicals @entity20 air strikes have hit @entity49 targets around 140 km to the south of @entity18 , also known as @entity125 , in the militant group 's heartland of @entity128 , and on saturday also hit sites to the east of the town			1
but the heavily - armed @entity133 insurgents appear gradually to be forcing the @entity6 fighters back around @entity18 , raising fears that the town may fall			2
either way , the tens of thousands of refugees who have crossed the border in recent days may be in @entity8 for a long time , aid workers say			1
' you 've seen it in other places along the border			0
there 's no fighting anymore but people stay in @entity8 , ' said @entity149 , who runs the relief effort in the border town of @entity43 for @entity152 , a @entity8 aid organisation			1
desperate : approximately 1.5million @entity27 have crossed the border into @entity8 , fearing execution by @entity16 troops who are attacking the town of @entity18 helpless : there are fears that @entity160 troops , who are partly being armed and supplied by @entity161 , will not be able to hold back the @entity16 assault on @entity18 lost : men wait beside a road near the town of @entity43 in @entity8 after fleeing from @entity16 militants in @entity9 who are advancing on the town of @entity18 , near the border victims : today the @entity20 released a video of warplanes attacking @entity16 militants as they fired on @entity6 refugees trying to flee across the border to safety ' i think it 'll be the same here , they never know when ( @entity49 ) might come back , ' he said , adding that his group 's initial relief effort aimed to help refugees camping out in mosques , schools and parks for a month only			1
crowds of mostly @entity27 cheered from the @entity8 hillside as @entity6 shells kick up plumes of dust near @entity49 positions just across the border , but the next day the jihadists seized new ground			2
the advance towards @entity18 is the latest in a series of lightning campaigns by the @entity199 group which have seen them seize swathes of territory in both @entity9 and @entity202			2
the @entity203 , which has warned that as many as 400,000 people could flee @entity18 to @entity8 , has said that the number of displaced makes the influx from the besieged border town the most serious yet of @entity9 's civil war			1
insurgents appear gradually tobe forcing the @entity6 fighters back around the border town of @entity18 , raising fears that the town may fall tensions between @entity8 authorities and @entity8 @entity27 are high			1
the @entity27 say @entity216 is not doing enough to help their beleaguered brethren in @entity9 the @entity203 , which has warned that as many as 400,000people could flee @entity18 to @entity8 many of those who have fled were from poor farming communities in the semi-arid terrain and were forced to leave their most valuable possessions behind - particularly livestock and vehicles			1
' we have nothing here , nowhere to sleep			0
if they let us collect our cars , we can sleep in them , ' said one @entity9 @entity6 refugee , 60 - year old @entity231			0
small crowds of @entity27 gathered at crossing points along the border to plead with @entity8 officials to be allowed to go back and collect their possessions , their vehicles tantalizingly visible through the barbed wire fence			2
a steady stream of new refugees kept arriving , many of them herding cattle			0
@entity9 @entity27 wait with their animals behind the border fences to cross into @entity8 unaware : a child sleeps in the arms of their mother , as heavily armed and armoured @entity8 soldier stand by limited access : @entity9 refugees are allowed through the @entity39 border gate labour minister @entity254 , who visited the border gate , was later quoted as saying the authorities would start to let livestock and vehicles cross			1
@entity8 military outposts occupy commanding positions on high ground along the border , the @entity49 front lines clearly visible below them			0
armoured military vehicles patrol the frontier , but @entity8 guns have remained silent , with @entity216 reluctant to be dragged into the war			0
the conflict has stirred up deep - seated resentment among @entity8 's @entity27 , who inhabit large parts of the country 's southeast and accuse @entity216 of backing the @entity199 insurgents in a bid to stifle a three - decade insurgency by @entity6 militants pushing for greater rights			2
thousands of @entity27 from across @entity8 have descended on the border in recent days , some living in quasi-refugee camps , in solidarity with displaced @entity6 communities , with police repeatedly firing tear gas to disperse protesters			1
' our family and friends are in @entity18 , this border has no meaning for us , ' said @entity290 , a protest organiser			0
' but the state attacks us with gas , tells us we 're terrorists			0
' @entity8 's government is concerned that @entity295 plans to arm @entity6 fighters could boost the @entity297 , the @entity6 militant group with which @entity216 has been negotiating a fragile peace deal to end the insurgency suspicion : the conflict has stirred up deep - seated resentment @entity302 , who inhabit large parts of the country'ssoutheast and accuse @entity216 of backing the @entity199 insurgents @entity307 's son and daughter both left their home in @entity8 's southeastern city of @entity311 to fight against @entity49 four months ago , and she has heard nothing from them since , except one brief glimpse in a tv news report			2
' sometimes i think if they just come close to the frontier i might catch a glimpse of them , ' she says , spending her night sleeping under small trees in a dusty field overlooking the border along with dozens of other @entity27			2
' of course it 's difficult ... when i hear the tank shells , it feels like my heart will explode			0
( but ) it 's an honour for me that they fight , an honour for the nation			0
' @entity8 's government categorically denies any support to @entity49 militants , but is concerned that @entity295 plans to arm @entity6 fighters could boost the @entity297 , the @entity6 militant group with which @entity216 has been negotiating a fragile peace deal to end the three - decade insurgency			2
the main @entity6 armed group in northern @entity9 , the @entity340 , is a sister group of the @entity297 , which is considered a terrorist organisation by @entity216 , the @entity20 and @entity342			0
' it 's very difficult for the @entity8 army			0
@entity49 are very dangerous , ' said one soldier patrolling the border , declining to be identified			0
' but ypg are very dangerous too			0
