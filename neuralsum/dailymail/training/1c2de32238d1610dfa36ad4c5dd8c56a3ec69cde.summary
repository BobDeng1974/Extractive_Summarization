@entity1 's dream of playing at next year 's @entity2 for @entity3 could be over after he was named in @entity5 's squad for their @entity7 opener against @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity1 's proposed move to @entity10 , which would make him available for selection for @entity3 , hit the rocks this week after a breakdown in negotiations between the @entity16 side and back - to - back @entity17 champions @entity5			1
@entity1 ( centre ) is held back by @entity20 defenders playing for @entity5 in the @entity21 last weekend the back row forward was named @entity17 player of the year as @entity5 won the @entity24 last season if the flanker plays on sunday , which looks almost certain given his inclusion in the squad , then he will be ineligible for @entity17 games for @entity10 , making the prospect of signing him far less attractive			1
head coach @entity33 insisted earlier this week that such a scenario would terminate their interest			0
@entity10 had moved to bring in the @entity17 player of the year , 29 , due to a back row crisis			2
@entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 are all injured , while @entity42 is banned			0
under the @entity16 's injury dispensation rules , clubs are permitted to spend up to Â£ 400,000 on cover for a like - for - like player who has been ruled out for at least 12 weeks			0
@entity1 made five appearances for @entity3 while at @entity48 in 2009 the move had the backing of @entity3 head coach @entity51 and the @entity52 , whose rules stipulate no - one playing their rugby outside of the @entity16 can wear the @entity55			2
with the @entity2 in @entity3 less than a year away , @entity1 , who earned five caps for @entity3 in 2009 , would need to move to the @entity16 this season to fit @entity3 's criteria			1
the former @entity48 man had been exploring the possibility of playing for @entity61 - where he has lived for the past three years - but had a recent change of heart and began searching for an @entity64 club with the reluctant blessing of @entity5 owner @entity66 and head coach @entity67			0
the back row forward looks set to stay at @entity5 and not play for @entity3 at next year 's @entity2 it looks like it is back to square one though for one of the world 's best back row forwards , who returned to @entity5 training this week and looks set to feature in their @entity17 opener on sunday			1
@entity1 was recently included in a provisional @entity61 squad , subject to his selection by their @entity79 for @entity82 qualification			0
if his route back with @entity3 is denied , he may revisit his interest in representing @entity61 at the @entity2 .			0

@entity1 looked set for move to @entity10 from @entity5
@entity17 player of the year needs to join @entity16 if he is *tofulfill* dream of representing @entity3 at 2015 @entity2
negotiations have broken down between @entity5 and @entity10
@entity1 named in @entity5 squad for @entity7 on sunday
if @entity1 plays he will be ineligible to play in @entity95 for @entity10
