a rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of @entity3 ’s and @entity4 ’s in later life			1
a natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases , researchers say			1
the protein , called @entity13 , is produced by muscular exertion and is released into the bloodstream as a hormone called irisin			2
a rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of @entity3 's and @entity4 's in later life they hope to use it to keep the neurons in the human brain healthy while also making new ones			1
‘ what is exciting is that a natural substance can be given in the bloodstream that can mimic some of the effects of endurance exercise on the brain , ’ said professor @entity13 , from @entity24 in @entity25			2
‘ our results indicate that @entity13 / irisin has the ability to control a very important neuro - protective pathway in the brain			0
’ in the study , laboratory mice regularly ran on a wheel for 30 days			0
the exercise spurred a rise in the @entity13 protein			2
that in turn increased a protein called brain - derived neurotrophic protein ( @entity47 ) in a part of the brain involved in learning and memory			0
a natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases , researchers say they used a harmless virus to deliver the protein to mice through the bloodstream , in hopes the @entity13 could reach the brain and raise @entity47 production			1
seven days later , they examined the mouse brains and observed a significant increase in @entity47 in the hippocampus area of the brain			0
professor @entity13 says more research is needed and the next step is to develop a stable form of irisin .			0
