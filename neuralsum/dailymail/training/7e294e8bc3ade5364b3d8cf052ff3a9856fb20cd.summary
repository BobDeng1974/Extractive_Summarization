daredevil @entity0 is about to embark on his biggest adventure yet - marrying his girlfriend and settling down			1
the risk - taking pilot will wed former model and beauty queen @entity4 next year			1
the @entity7 couple then plan to make their home in @entity10 , @entity11			1
his fiancee was forced to watch with her heart in her mouth as the 43 - year - old plummeted towards the ground at speeds of up to 834mph			1
now he has come through the terrifying feat unscathed , @entity0 is ready to tie the knot with 26 - year - old miss @entity4			1
he intends to marry the former miss @entity29 in the @entity31			1
@entity0 has previously jumped from a plane and flown across the channel with wings strapped to his back , leaped off the @entity37 statue in @entity38 , and plunged from the 101 - storey @entity39 in @entity40			2
tv viewers around the world watched frozen in shock on sunday as the @entity7 skydiver took on the biggest leap of his career , freefalling from the edge of space			1
it took @entity0 around two - and - a - half hours to reach 128,177ft above the @entity51 desert - and less than ten minutes to plummet down leap of faith : millions watched in shock as @entity0 plummeted 24 miles at 834mph eight million saw the clip on @entity56 alone as he became the first skydiver to break the sound barrier in the highest and fastest drop ever known			1
perhaps the sheer terror of the drop persuaded the brave pilot to keep his feet on the ground for a while longer			0
he has admitted that one point in his supersonic plunge towards earth , he went into an out - of - control ' death spin '			1
' in that situation , when you spin around , it 's like hell and you do n't know if you can get out of that spin or not , ' he said			1
' the exit was perfect but then i started spinning slowly			0
i thought i ’d just spin a few times and that would be that , but then i started to speed up			2
' it was really brutal at times			0
i thought for a few seconds that i ’d lose consciousness			0
' freefall experts immediately recognised the danger that @entity0 was in as he began to spin laterally , his head and feet rotating around his centre			1
death spin : freefall experts immediately recognised the danger that @entity0 was in as he began to spin laterally , his head and feet rotating around his centre risks as he turned through the air from 128,000ft included a headache , shortness of breath , vision failure , mental confusion and even unconsciousness			1
another result could have been burst eyeballs — this occurs when pressures exceeding -4 @entity101 's build up in the skull and blood and spinal fluid are forced outward			0
' when i was spinning the first 10 , 20 seconds , i never thought i was going to lose my life but i was disappointed because i 'm going to lose my record			2
i put seven years of my life into this , ' he said			0
' of course it was terrifying			2
i was fighting all the way down because i knew that there must be a moment where i can handle it			0
' as onlookers in the command centre began to become extremely concerned , he finally managed to stabilise and regain control of his attempt			0
more than 40 television networks in 50 countries carried the live feed , the organisers reported , and it was shown my more than 130 digital outlets			0
@entity0 has made more than 2,600 terrifying jumps			2
feet on the ground : @entity0 is now a hero after he smashed records with his terrifying jump he spent five years in the @entity7 army , where he served in its parachute display team , before learning to base jump in 1995			1
within two years , he was the base jumping world champion after plunging from a bridge in @entity134 and had soon earned the sponsorship of energy drinks maker @entity136			0
after that , the sky was the limit as he tried ever more dangerous and outlandish jumps			0
he once said he wanted to be known as ‘ the @entity141 of the @entity142 ’ , adding : ‘ the bit i love most is the second before jumping when you know it can all go wrong yet you still do it			0
’ let 's hope his bride - to - be has nerves of steel as well			2
in 2003 , he struck panic into the heart of then - girlfriend @entity155 by jumping out of a plane at 30,000ft and flying over the channel with just a 6ft - wing carbon fibre wing strapped to his back			0
‘ i could n’t sleep last night , but i never doubted he could do it , ’ she said after the stunt .			0
