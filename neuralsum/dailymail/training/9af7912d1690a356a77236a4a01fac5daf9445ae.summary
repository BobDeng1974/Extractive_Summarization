by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 14 february 2013 an angler needed 12 stitches after embedding a fishing weight in his cheek while casting off			1
@entity6 , 51 , was hoping to land some carp fish , but was caught out after his lead weight snagged on overhanging branches			1
he yanked his rod a couple of times to free the line before the bulbous object suddenly flew back at him ' like a bullet ' 50 feet through the air and struck him in the face			2
caught : @entity6 , 51 , was hoping to land some carp fish but became the catch himself after his lead weight snagged on overhanging branches mr @entity6 dropped to his knees and thought the object had just grazed him at first until fishing friend @entity24 told him it was embedded in his right cheek			1
an ambulance was called and mr @entity6 from @entity27 , @entity28 , was rushed to hospital to have the 50 gram weight removed			1
luckily , the weight did n't break his cheek bone or jaw or damage any nerves			1
mr @entity6 , who jet washes wheelie bins for a living , was told the item could easily have killed him had it hit him in an eye , throat or gone through his mouth			2
stuck : mr @entity6 dropped to his knees and thought the object had just grazed him at first until fishing friend @entity24 told him it was embedded in his right cheek he said : ' i had been fishing for about three quarters of an hour but had n't caught anything			1
' we were fishing quite close to a tree because we knew carp hide out there in the winter months			2
' my line got snagged in some of the branches so i tried a couple of gentle tugs			2
' when that did n't work i lost my patience a little bit and gave it a massive yank			2
' then i just remember catching a quick glimpse of the weight coming straight at me like a bullet at the very last second and then thinking it hurt a little bit			0
' i dropped to my knees and thought it had just grazed my face			0
recovery : after the accident mr @entity6 was taken to @entity68 where he had 12 stitches ' when i first touched it i thought it was just swollen before i realised it was the weight and it was now stuck in my face			1
' even though there was a bit of blood it did n't actually hurt that much			0
it hurt more when i was given the local anaesthetic later in hospital			0
' i packed up my fishing gear and the bailiff at the lake called an ambulance			0
' i 'm very lucky			0
it could have killed me			0
had it gone through my mouth it would have probably gone straight through and out the back of my head			0
' i 'd advise other people who get their line snagged to just cut it off rather than do what i did			0
' after the accident , which happened at @entity95 's @entity94 in @entity96 , near @entity27 , mr @entity6 was taken to @entity68 where he had 12 stitches .			1
