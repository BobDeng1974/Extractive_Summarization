big issue sellers @entity11 , left , and @entity12 , right , were today jailed for life for the brutal murder of @entity15			1
the couple left the body of their victim in a suitcase for weeks after he was killed			2
but when police officers visited the flat on an unrelated matter they failed to inspect the case despite spotting it covered in a sleeping bag , saying it did ' not look out of place ' in a house so strewn with rubbish			2
and despite the fact they noticed that @entity11 was said to be ' tetchy and agitated ' and @entity12 had glazed eyes during their visit , they failed to raise the alarm			2
the corpse was not discovered until ten days later in august last year when police officers went to a neighbouring address and noticed a ' terrible smell ' coming from the property in @entity52 , @entity53			1
@entity12 , who was a tenant at the address , then tried to pass off the smell as coming from an abscess on his foot			1
victim @entity15 , 49 , was stabbed and beaten to death before his body was stuffed in a suitcase and left to rot in the bathroom the couple lived in squalid conditions in the house in @entity53 , before a foul stench eventually alerted officers to @entity15 's body the couple were both known addicts - with @entity11 a heroin and crack cocaine user , and @entity12 drinking up to seven litres of cider a day			1
gut wrenching photos of the flat show kitchen tops strewn with empty bottles of cider and spirits and piles of washing up and the lounge and bedrooms festooned with dumped clothing , bedding , books and paint pots			0
@entity11 initially lived with @entity12 but then befriended @entity15 who lived in a neighbouring street before moving into his house after claiming she was homeless			1
shortly afterwards she began bullying @entity15 , and on one occasion threatened him with a knife before he asked her to leave			2
@entity90 and @entity12 were known addicts , with @entity12 drinking up to seven litres of cider a day she and @entity12 then began preying on @entity15 for his benefit money and the victim 's post office card - which @entity15 had used to withdraw his fortnightly invalidity benefit of £ 200 - went missing			1
the card was used by the couple to withdraw £ 190 from @entity15 's account			1
it is believed @entity15 was attacked when he returned from a friend 's house to his flat to collect his glasses			1
the killers were later seen pulling a wheeled suitcase near to the house			0
@entity108 , prosecuting , said @entity109 and @entity110 initially visited @entity12 's flat but did not believe there was anything suspicious			1
despite a visit from officers , police failed to notice the body stuffed into a suitcase in the couple 's bathroom the couple used victim @entity15 's post office card to withdraw funds from his account mr @entity124 said : ' the flat was cluttered with junk			1
the officers saw the suitcase and by that stage it was in the flat in the bathroom under a sleeping bag			0
but there was no significant smell			0
' the officers did not check the contents of the suitcase and eventually they left			0
' @entity138 told the jury she and her colleague often visited properties that smelt bad and were untidy			0
she told the court : ' because the flat was in such a terrible state it did n't appear out of place to have a sleeping bag and suitcase in the bathroom			0
' after returning days later to the property , however , pc @entity149 told the hearing the stench of the body was undeniable : ' the smell became increasingly worse			2
both @entity12 and @entity11 denied murder and blamed each other for the killing the couple , who were both @entity10 sellers , lived in squalid conditions in their house in @entity53 ' it 's a smell i recognise and it was very , very strong now			1
' i cut the corner of the suitcase with my pocket knife and it revealed what i could see to be a human foot and what i thought was the side of a head			0
' @entity11 and @entity12 were both subsequently arrested			2
a post-mortem examination showed that @entity15 had died following a violent attack in which he had been stabbed and beaten			0
it is estimated he had been dead for about two weeks			0
the couple were jailed for life at @entity13 , pictured , and told they must serve a minimum of 23 years @entity12 and @entity11 both denied murder - blaming each other for the killing			0
the couple were also both convicted of perverting the course of justice senior investigating officer , @entity187 of @entity188 said after the case : ' @entity11 and @entity12 were both dependent on alcohol and drugs and went to desperate lengths to obtain cash to fund their habits			0
' this is reflected in the theft of @entity15 's benefits before and after they killed him			1
each blames the other for what happened and both have fabricated different stories so we might never know exactly what happened and why			0
' what we do know is that from start to finish , they worked together : in stealing @entity15 's benefits , in his violent murder and in trying to hide his body			1

the @entity10 seller initially tried to pass off the stench as coming from an abscess on his foot
