by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 02:41 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 31 december 2013 it is quite extraordinary that @entity4 ’s position as @entity6 captain should even be a subject for debate , let alone his dismissal a serious option at the end of this admittedly tortuous @entity12			1
it is time to end this nonsense now			0
how any serious cricketing judge can believe that @entity6 would be better served by jettisoning the captain now , however badly his team have fared here , is beyond me			1
this is no time to throw out the man who now has the chance to build his own @entity6 team , not lead @entity26 ’s			1
right man for the job : @entity29 is also adamant that @entity4 should remain @entity6 captain skipper : captain @entity4 walks alone during day four at @entity31 , but has defended the current management structure within the camp it has surely not been forgotten that this is @entity4 ’s first defeat in six @entity37 series as captain			1
there were no cries to get rid of him when @entity6 were creating history by coming from one down to earn an historic @entity36 win in @entity45			1
and there were no complaints , other than from the tiresome @entity48 , when @entity4 was leading @entity6 to a 3 - 0 @entity12 victory last summer , a win that would have been greater but for ridiculous bad light regulations at the @entity52			1
it is @entity4 ’s misfortune to have come up against probably the two best , most pro-active captains in the world game at the moment in @entity58 and @entity59 in his last four series			2
the @entity6 captain has suffered in the field , but not off it , by comparison with the @entity65 and @entity66 leaders but he has still only lost one of those four series			2
pecking order : @entity70 is @entity6 's current @entity71 captain and could replace @entity4 i am not saying that @entity4 is a tactical genius			1
his game - plan has looked defensive and unimaginative for much of this @entity12 but that has mainly been because his team have been struggling so much			2
when @entity6 have been on top under @entity4 and his bowlers have been dictating terms then his apparent tactical inadequacies have been less pronounced			1
a captain , at the end of the day , can only ever be as good as his bowlers to a huge extent			0
the biggest reason to defend @entity4 the @entity6 captain is that he is having to learn arguably the toughest job in any sport at the highest level in front of the prying eyes of many a former international captain			1
@entity6 players are identified so young these days and invariably plucked out of the domestic system so early that they never have a chance to gain the county captaincy experience that many of the best @entity6 leaders have had before the ultimate elevation			2
@entity4 will never be one for an eye - catching , ‘ look at me ’ fielding place or bowling change			2
he is an under - stated character but a cricketer and man of substance who is destined to break every @entity6 batting record in the book and will always seek to lead by example rather than any ‘ funky on - field tactics			2
thrashing : @entity6 's latest loss at the @entity31 put them 4 - 0 behind and on course to be whitewashed dejection : @entity4 leads @entity6 off the field after their eight - wicket defeat in the fourth @entity37 the most important thing is that he does so much of his good work away from the spotlight , in the many off - field ways that a cricket captain must lead			1
the dressing room are totally with him , including @entity124 , who cook bravely and rightly brought back into the @entity6 fold last summer			0
and , although it is perhaps a negative reason for advocating the status quo , who on earth could conceivably replace @entity4 as captain now , just when the need is greatest for his steady hand on the tiller and his runs at the top of the order ? my colleague @entity139 , a cricket correspondent for nine years and a man who knows his subject having covered @entity6 under captains of real substance like @entity145 and @entity146 , advocates @entity70 and , yes , he has one of the best brains in the @entity6 cricket team			1
but the fact that @entity6 have quietly preferred @entity152 and then , when he was dropped in @entity31 , @entity149 rather than @entity70 as @entity37 vice-captain says it all			1
a fast bowler with a history of leaving tours early through injury who plays in all forms of the game can not feasibly be the captain of @entity6			2
carry on : @entity4 still needs the chance ton build his own side , not continue with @entity26 's looking up : @entity4 's position as @entity6 captain is under threat after a disastrous @entity12 tour elsewhere the captaincy cupboard is bare			1
@entity124 has the experience and know - how to have a second crack at the job but the wounds from his serious brushes with authority run too deep for it ever to be a viable proposition			0
@entity6 even preferred @entity175 to @entity124 when they needed an emergency captain for a @entity71 international last year			1
@entity149 is another senior professional but nothing in his game and demeanour suggests he is a leader of men while the same reservations that apply to @entity70 would rule out @entity182 as a serious candidate even though he does not play @entity71 cricket for @entity6			1
@entity6 very much hope @entity185 will be @entity4 ’s eventual successor but clearly the time for that is not now , particularly as he would be in the same captaincy boat as @entity4 in having had little chance to gain leadership experience before graduating to @entity191 level			1
leave @entity185 alone to get back in the runs			0
so cook it is but i admit , as @entity145 has so eloquently pointed out in these pages , that he has to improve			0
he tried to fight the same battle here as @entity26 did in winning three years ago but now is the time for change			0
to the future : @entity29 wants to stay on as @entity6 coach despite the @entity12 debacle for a start @entity4 must make it absolutely clear who is in charge			1
this is his @entity6 now			0
not even really @entity29 ’s			0
as @entity209 , another great coach of @entity6 , would say – the coach is a consultant			0
it is the captain who is in charge of a cricket team			0
do not let @entity70 and @entity182 so clearly set their own fields , @entity216			0
show them who is boss on the field as well as off it			0
throw off the shackles of conservatism			0
there will still be times when he gets it wrong , like on the fateful third morning of the fourth test when he seemed clueless against @entity230 , but those periods of play will become lesser the more he does the job			0
@entity4 has only been in full charge for a year , for heaven ’s sake , and at 29 he should be in his prime as a player			0
give him a bit more time and he will learn , as others like @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity26 did , with experience			0
@entity4 has risen to every other challenge set before him in his cricketing career and he will succeed in this one too			0
@entity6 will give him every chance to because they believe in him .			2

@entity4 must get the chance to build his own side , not lead @entity26 's
the @entity12 loss is @entity4 's first @entity36 defeat in six as captain
team *director* @entity29 wants @entity4 to lead his @entity6 side forward
@entity71 captain @entity70 is being *tipped* as a possible successor
