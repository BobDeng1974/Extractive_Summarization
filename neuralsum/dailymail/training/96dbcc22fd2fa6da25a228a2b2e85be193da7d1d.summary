still , mr @entity20 insists his team 's only pre-show concerns , other than covering the odd zit here or there , were with keeping the models ' moisturized			2
' according to the beauty guru , it was mr @entity34 who initially raised the idea , suggesting his models ' maybe should n't have much make - up , ' but it was mr @entity20 who proposed they strip them of all of it			1
