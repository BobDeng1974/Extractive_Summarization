in the futuristic 1987 film robocop it was depicted as a crime - ridden city left in ruins after years of financial decline			1
the film 's writer @entity5 scribbled ' the future left @entity8 behind ' on the first page of the script to sum up the city where the story is set			1
little did he know , his prophetic note would become an apt description of modern - day @entity8 after the city filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in @entity19 history with debts of around $ 18 billion earlier this month			1
he insisted on @entity8 being the setting for the film as it has always been very dependent on a single industry - car manufacturing which led to the city being dubbed ' @entity8 ' or ' @entity47 ' because of this			1
but the decline of the industry in the 1980s , when @entity51 emerged as new rival in the automotive world , started to have a major impact on the city 's prosperity			0
mr @entity34 told @entity57 : ' the reason @entity8 is important is because it 's facing an economic blight that you can imagine happening in a lot of places			2
decline : buildings in what was once @entity8 's prime business district sit largely abandoned after the city 's population shrunk to 700,000 the abandoned @entity68 in @entity8 - the cradle of the automobile assembly line and a symbol of industrial might - after the city filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in @entity19 history after decades of decline ' in retrospect , the idea of " robocop " really goes back to the car industry			1
the sculpture of it is very much @entity8 road - iron			1
having grown up in the sixties when the muscle car was so prominent , the notion of cars was very important to me then and ultimately to the formation of @entity24			0
' looking to the future : writer @entity34 wrote ' the future left @entity8 behind ' on the first page of the @entity24 script - which proved to be an accurate prediction of what would happen to the city the @entity19 government bailed out the automotive industry to the tune of $ 80 billion between 2008 and 2010 but that has done little to stop the financial decline in @entity8			1
it has an unemployment rate of 16 per cent of its 700,000 population as the number of jobs in the automotive industry continue to decline			0
@entity8 was also been named the most dangerous city in @entity19 in 2012 by @entity109 and the most miserable in 2013			1
those living in the city face major cuts to public services under debt restructuring proposals			0
the city 's current plight shares striking similarities with the future @entity8 portrayed in @entity24			2
in the film , @entity8 is reliant upon a multinational corporation , called @entity120 ( @entity120 ) , which runs everything from hospitals to its police force			2
mr @entity34 believes that private companies are playing an ever increasing role in all areas of our lives - just like in @entity24			0
he said : ' we are now living in the world that i was proposing in @entity24			0
we are increasingly asking corporations to do these things for us ... to provide human services			0
but their objectives are different to public service needs			0
' ironically , with a cheap and educated labour force , mr @entity34 adds that @entity8 is in need of a modernisation and advancement - making it the ideal place to start a robotics company			2
he added : ' there is a cheap and educated labor force			0
some kind of high - tech would be good for them ... i would say with the industrial and mechanical legacy there , somebody should start a robotics company			0
' ruins : there are believed to be around 30,000 homes that need to be demolished in @entity8 after decades of decline left it too poor to pay billions of dollars owed bondholders , retired cops and current city workers run down : a ' @entity162 ' sign stands in front of dilapidated houses on @entity165 in @entity8 similarities : robocop , about a wounded officer who is brought back as a cyborg to police @entity8 's streets , proved to be an accurate prediction of the financial future of the city			1
