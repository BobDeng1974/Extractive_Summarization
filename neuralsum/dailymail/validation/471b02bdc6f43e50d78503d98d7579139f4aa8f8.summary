there was nothing more mind - numbingly maddening in the aftermath of @entity6 ’s worst @entity5 exit yet than the immediate reaction of @entity8			1
‘ we thought 275 was chaseable			0
we ’ll have to look at the data , ’ said a coach now fighting to avoid his second ignominious exit from international cricket as the reality of an embarrassing group stage elimination sank in			0
well , @entity6 should rip up their data along with their whole philosophy towards one - day cricket and start again			1
@entity8 faces an uncertain future following @entity6 's humiliating exit from the @entity21 @entity6 were beaten by 15 runs at the @entity23 to make it four defeats against @entity27 - playing nations @entity6 captain @entity28 looks dejected as he leaves the field after their @entity5 match @entity28 's fifth odi duck in 12 innings summed up their poor performance at the @entity5 90 - the amount of runs captain @entity28 scored in five innings at the @entity5 12.2 - the overs it took for @entity40 to beat @entity6 's total of 123 in their second group game			1
111 - @entity44 's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament 654 - total of runs scored by @entity44 and @entity49 against @entity6 1 - number of centuries scored by an @entity6 batsman against @entity27 playing nations 72 - number of runs scored by @entity49 off the bowling of @entity55 0 - number of wins registered by @entity6 over @entity27 playing nations in the tournament 0 - the number of centuries scored by a @entity60 batsman in a @entity5 before playing @entity6 on monday			1
37.4 - 1 - 234 - 5 - @entity55 's tournament bowling figures			0
49 - the amount of runs @entity64 went for in two overs against @entity40			0
you do not need analysis to know that they have stunk this tournament out and , after this 15 - run defeat by @entity60 , are once again the laughing stock of the cricket world			1
the only statistic @entity8 needs to know is that @entity6 , having been thrashed by @entity44 , @entity40 and @entity49 , were humbled by a @entity60 side who beat them here at their own very @entity77 game			1
the key data is that @entity6 , having defeated just @entity79 so far , have excelled themselves in being even worse at this @entity5 than the five previous stinkers since they came so close to winning the 1992 tournament in @entity44			1
and this humiliation has come after the @entity83 were moved and a winter of one - day cricket provided to try to make sure @entity6 had every chance of finally competing for a first global 50 - over trophy that looks further away than ever			1
in truth , arranging a one - day series against @entity49 before @entity89 was akin to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound because @entity6 are light years away from the dynamic , vibrant teams we have seen here			1
to hurl all the blame in the direction of @entity8 would be unfair but there is no question that his position must now come under serious scrutiny , as too will that of the man who re-appointed him in @entity104			2
@entity105 does not become @entity107 chairman until may but he is not the sort of man to postpone a big decision and the coach and managing director may soon be caught up in the new broom that is sweeping through the @entity77 game			0
@entity6 batsman @entity115 reacts after he was dismissed during the 15 - run defeat by @entity60 @entity8 faces an uncertain future following @entity6 's humiliating exit against @entity60 dec 19 - @entity119 replaced by @entity28 as @entity121 captain jan 14 - @entity6 beat @entity122 by 60 runs as @entity124 hits magnificent 187 @entity125 beat @entity6 by three wickets but @entity28 hits 121 in first odi since replacing @entity119 as captain jan 20 - @entity6 beat @entity129 by nine wickets jan 23 - @entity44 beat @entity6 by three wickets via a @entity131 century jan 30 - @entity6 beat @entity129 by three wickets to set up tri-series final with @entity44 feb 1 - same old , same old as @entity44 again beat @entity6 by 112 runs to win tri-series feb 9 - @entity6 beat @entity135 by nine wickets in @entity5 warm - up match feb 11 - @entity137 beat @entity6 by four wickets in final @entity5 warm - up tie feb 14 - @entity44 beat @entity6 by 111 runs on opening day of @entity5 feb 20 - @entity40 beat @entity6 by eight wickets as @entity8 's men are crushed feb 22 - @entity6 beat @entity79 by 119 runs as expected via 128 from @entity144 feb 28 - @entity49 beat shameful @entity6 by nine wickets for a third crushing defeat ' there was no obvious team to pick because they 're young players , they have n't played a lot of cricket			1
we 've got nine guys who have n't been to a @entity5 before			0
' that 's the reality of it			0
you make your choice , you pick the side you think is the best team , which we did , and we have to accept they did n't play well enough			0
' @entity161 and @entity162 were among those criticising @entity6 on @entity164 after their early elimination in the group stages			0
' @entity6 had the wrong team , the wrong style of play and everyone could see it			2
tonight 's result is not a shock , i feel for @entity28			0
coach is in trouble , ' @entity161 tweeted			0
@entity162 added : ' i can not believe this			0
but , well done @entity60 ! you deserved it ! ' do not say we have n't prioritised odi cricket ! we played a back - to - back @entity83 to make sure @entity6 played six months of @entity181 before this @entity5 ! ' @entity182 , the former @entity6 striker , said : ' @entity60 win ! congratulations to them			1
the good news is , @entity6 ca n't possibly get any worse			0
' and @entity185 wrote : ' what an absolute disgrace			0
[ @entity104 ] @entity104 and @entity8 have dragged @entity77 cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty , clueless incompetence			2
' i want @entity104 and @entity8 sacked today and @entity162 restored to the team			2
this farce just reached its true , hideous nadir			0
' i would n't trust @entity104 and @entity8 to run a * * * * ing bath , let alone the @entity6 cricket team			1
' @entity8 pictured after the defeat as he speaks with press in @entity200 about their @entity5 exit to highlight @entity8 immediate mention of data on television is not to take a cheap shot at a decent man who appears to be liked and respected by players who on the whole have let him and their country down here			2
by the time he gave a more considered press conference yesterday there was no mention of the statistics that seem to have weighed down even a free spirit in @entity28 , who has been a huge disappointment as captain here			0
my gut feeling is that @entity8 will be given the summer before @entity6 think about replacing him but a personal view is that maybe his assistant @entity220 , an @entity221 and @entity223 winner with @entity49 before throwing in his lot with @entity6 , could take extra responsibility for limited - overs cricket			2
@entity6 are about to embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 tests in 10 months and the danger is that one - day cricket will again be shoved to the bottom of @entity6 ’s list of priorities unless a clear strategy is undertaken			1
the overwhelming favourite to succeed @entity8 if and when he goes is @entity237 but he distanced himself from the role yesterday and there is no doubt that the @entity242 coach and his family are happy and settled in @entity244			2
@entity245 ( centre ) exchanges words with @entity60 captain @entity248 ( left ) at the @entity23 @entity60 sealed a surprise win over @entity6 at the @entity5 as @entity8 and his men suffered elimination @entity237 has already turned down a role with his native @entity44 under @entity253 and has been given permission by @entity242 to coach a team , probably @entity200 , in next year ’s @entity256 while staying at @entity257			1
the constant year - round slog of international cricket is making it harder for countries to attract the best coaches and former @entity242 chairman @entity105 may need to be at his most persuasive if he wants to recruit his old county coach			0
@entity8 and @entity104 are not the only ones under the microscope			2
@entity28 refused to say that he wanted to carry on as one - day captain yesterday and reiterated his intention to miss @entity6 ’s one - day international against @entity268 in may , their first of another ‘ new ’ era , to play in the @entity270			1
well , i am sorry but if he does want to continue then he needs to be with the team in his native @entity273 , particularly as it will be impossible for @entity6 players touring @entity135 next month to make the @entity268 trip on may 8			0
the sheer volume of cricket means that the best way for @entity6 to catch up in 50 - over cricket is to build a new young team of one - day players as different as possible to that which will contest @entity27 in the next year against @entity135 , @entity40 , @entity44 , @entity137 and @entity282			1
@entity28 looks to have been given the backing by @entity8 to continue as @entity6 's one - day captain @entity119 ( left ) was devastated to be axed from 50 - over cricket on the brink of his first @entity5 @entity124 , who left @entity6 far too much to do against @entity60 by getting out after scoring 62 off 83 balls , will surely bow out of one - day cricket after friday ’s dead rubber against @entity290 while it is in the best interests of @entity293 and @entity294 for them to do the same			1
@entity245 was strongly considered for the one - day captaincy by @entity6 when they sacked @entity119 before they plumped for the out - of - form @entity28 and i would give him the one - day job now and build a new team around him			1
it is certainly possible to envisage a squad led by @entity245 and including @entity301 , who came so close to recuing @entity6 yesterday , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity115 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 growing into an outfit capable of competing in the modern one - day world			1
but the seam bowling remains a huge worry , not least the absence of a quick left - armer			0
@entity60 , worthy quarter - finalists now , had the fastest bowler on show yesterday in @entity318 , who took four wickets , and that must be the first time they have ever had more pace at their disposal than @entity6			2
the lack of variety in @entity6 ’s bowling is one of the many reasons why they will be on their way home before the business end of this elongated tournament			0
and why they will be returning to the drawing board when they get there in their never - ending search for one - day success .			2

@entity6 were knocked out of the @entity5 against @entity60
coach @entity8 spoke in the aftermath of looking at data in review
@entity6 should ignore that and *rethink* their entire one - day philosophy
the nation are the laughing stock of the cricketing world once again
@entity6 are light years off the @entity5 's dynamic , vibrant teams
@entity8 and @entity104 will have their positions brought under scrutiny
@entity245 should be given one - day captain 's job and made team 's focus
