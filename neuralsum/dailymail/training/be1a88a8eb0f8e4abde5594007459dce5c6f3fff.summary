by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 12 december 2013 as the sea view from @entity3 's bungalow got ever closer she adamantly refused to leave			1
one - by - one her neighbours moved out as the pounding waves eroded the cliffs below their homes			2
but the 68 - year - old , affectionately nicknamed grandmother @entity10 because she seemed to think she could stop the tide , said no. today though , after five years in her home , mrs @entity3 had to finally give in as last week 's surge tide left the three - bedroom bungalow overhanging the 80ft cliff			1
sad day : @entity18 's cliff - top bungalow has been demolished today after it was left on the edge of a north @entity21 cliff after the storm surge last week on the edge : the grandmother has lived in the home since 2008 and has even turned down large sums so she could stay as long as possible message : the resident was known affectionately as @entity29 @entity10 as she believed she could turn the tide , but today she has seen it demolished as it slipped towards the @entity33 a decade in the making : this photograph taken in 2003 shows how the bungalow then enjoyed a decent sized garden to the cliff edge			1
10 years on it had all gone through erosion she watched in sadness as her seaside home where she had hoped to live for several more years was demolished			1
mrs @entity3 bought her home with idyllic views of the @entity33 for £ 25,000 when it was 20ft from the edge in 2008			1
as the sea approached ever closer she was offered £ 53,000 under a government compensation scheme to leave , but she refused			1
the end came today though after the highest surge tide for 60 years tore away huge chunks of the cliff at @entity53 near @entity54 , @entity21 , washing away part of the property 's foundations			1
the lean - to extension of her 1930s bungalow containing her bathroom , toilet , pantry and part of her bedroom was left hanging over the edge and at risk of toppling over at any minute			1
compromise : mrs @entity3 admits she was offered more than £ 50,000 to leave but said she could not be without her £ 1million view huge damage : coastal erosion has brought @entity18 's cliff - top bungalow closer to the waves on @entity53 beach 20 years earlier than expected , and has been broken up by the local council mrs @entity3 , a former maths teacher and owner of a tractor repair business , carried away the bulk of her possessions before demolition workers moved in			1
she has now moved into a nearby mobile home also on the cliff - top			1
as she surveyed the remains of her bungalow today , she said : ' i do n’t regret buying this place as i have had five years of sheer pleasure living here			2
all change : this was the view in 2008 , where @entity18 's bungalow was in the middle of this row of houses			1
today it was on the edge ' it has been like being on holiday every day of the year , waking up to a fantastic view over the sea and watching the sun rise over the water			1
' only last summer , i was string in my garden with a glass of wine and a fantastic view			2
i just love the way that the sea and the sky constantly change colour			0
it is a constantly moving landscape			0
' @entity114 who has seven grandchildren said she did not regret losing out on a £ 13,000 offer of compensation after she refused to move out in 2009			2
she could have got an extra £ 40,000 by selling a planning consent which would have enabled her to build a replacement home inland as part of the compensation package			2
the owners of ten other homes on the clifftop all accepted the compensation offer , leaving @entity114 as the only remaining resident			0
she said : ' people say " you threw away £ 53,000 " , but i just reply : " look at the million pound view i have had for the past five years			1
" ' it has been magical living on the edge of a clifftop – the sea , the skies , the gulls – and i ’m just jolly grateful			2
i have been incredibly happy here for the last five years			0
' i have loved every minute of it			0
i bought the house knowing that it was going to go one day and i ’ve got no regrets , although i had hoped to stay a lot longer			0
' @entity114 said she had moved out of the main bedroom of her bungalow three - weeks - ago as a precaution and started sleeping in another bedroom further away from the cliff			1
she decided to stay in her mobile home on the night of the surge tide because she knew her home would be in danger			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' when the tide came , it was absolutely terrifying			0
waves were smashing into the cliff and water was spraying 20ft into the air			0
i had never seen anything like it			0
' when i saw the damage i realised i could never go back			0
friends and neighbours have helped me move out most of my things over the last few days			0
' i managed to salvage almost everything of value apart from my jewellery which was left on a shelf in the bedroom which was hanging over the edge			2
' i could n’t risk going back in there to get it as it was too dangerous and now it is somewhere in the wreckage which went over the cliff			2
frightening : demolition workers were forced to come in today after it became too dangerous for its owner to be inside crushed : the home was flattened today after the tidal surge last thursday , which was higher than levels recorded in the 1953 floods that devastated @entity184 ' i just consider myself fortunate that i was able to get nearly everything @entity186 am luckier than the people in @entity188 and @entity189 who lost everything			1
' @entity114 who separated from her husband in 2000 added : ' it is an incredibly sad day , seeing my home demolished			0
i have been so busy that i have not had time to shed a tear			0
' but i 've said goodbye to the house and later when i 'm less busy i 'll find a quiet corner and howl my eyes out			0
meanwhile , we 're @entity200 are n't we so i 'll keep a stiff upper lip			0
' @entity10 , who ruled @entity202 between 995 and 1035 , is often said to have tried to turn back the tide – but failed as the waves began lapping around his feet			0
but historians say this is just a myth and , in fact , the @entity209 monarch was really trying to show to courtiers that despite his powers he was n’t great enough to stop the sea			0
caravans were left balancing on the edge of a cliff after the storm swept the @entity200			1
the surge , which flooded areas of @entity220 , including @entity221 and @entity222 , and led to mass evacuations along the coast , caused damage expected to cost millions of pounds to repair			2
the owner of the caravan , in @entity228 , near @entity229 , @entity230 , was not inside at the time , but her friend @entity231 could scarcely believe the carnage that confronted him when he went to check the site			0
mr @entity231 said : ' the weather took down a massive retaining wall at the front and damaged two or three caravans			0
' precarious : these caravans were left teetering on the edge of a cliff in @entity230 after the storm and tidal surge that lashed the @entity200 the storm , which flooded areas of @entity220 , including @entity221 and @entity222 , and led to mass evacuations along the coast , caused damage expected to cost millions of pounds to repair damage : the owner of this caravan , in @entity228 , near @entity229 , @entity230 , was not inside at the time , but her friend could scarcely believe the carnage that confronted him when he went to check the site			1

@entity18 's north @entity21 home was destroyed today as it teetered on edge of @entity33 cliff
last week 's storm surge - higher than the *notorious* 1953 flood - caused massive erosion and left home unsafe
the 68 - year - old grandmother paid £ 25,000 for it in 2008 and turned down £ 50,000 to leave because she loved it there
' people say : " you threw away £ 53,000 " , i reply : " look at the million pound view i 've had for five years " , ' she said
today demolition workers moved in because it was too dangerous and she now lives in a nearby mobile home
