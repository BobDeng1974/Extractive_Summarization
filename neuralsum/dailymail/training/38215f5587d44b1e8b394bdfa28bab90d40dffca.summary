by @entity0 published : 02:16 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 15 may 2013 melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century , scientists claim			1
they claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the @entity10 coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of climate change			2
if such rises were to take place , @entity14 ’s current sea defences would struggle to cope , with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade			1
how the @entity20 could be hit : researchers say the areas in red would be completely underwater , and believe the @entity24 would struggle to cope , with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade using a model of ‘ medium ’ climate change , they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm ( 1.4 in ) and 36.8cm ( 14in ) to average global sea levels by 2100			1
warming temperatures also cause the sea to expand , in effect doubling the increase from ice melt			0
once this is taken into account , alongside storm surges and weather patterns , the team say the ‘ best guess ’ for overall rise in sea levels globally could be from 6cm ( 2.4in ) up to 69cm ( 27in )			1
the team of scientists from the @entity47 programme , including academics from the @entity49 and @entity50 , are the first to try and accurately predict how polar ice melt will contribute to rises in future sea levels			1
the authors say the report is the most detailed yet into the loss of ice from @entity58 , @entity59 and glaciers			0
using a model of ‘ medium ’ climate change , they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm ( 1.4 in ) and 36.8cm ( 14in ) to average global sea levels by 2100			1

how melting glaciers cause sea rise : using a model of ? medium ? climate change , they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm ( 1.4 in ) and 36.8cm ( 14in ) to average global sea levels by 2100			1

rises at the more extreme end of the scale would spell disaster for small @entity91 island states like @entity92 , and other low - lying nations such as the @entity94			0
cities inhabited by millions , including @entity14 and @entity96 , will also have to have to build up defences			2
the @entity24 would struggle to cope with predicted storm surges , experts say , leaving @entity14 at risk of ' great floods ' current defences are only adequate to provide protection to the one - in - one thousand years , shown by the dark black line			1
this would be substantially reduced with a change in regional sea level to approximately once in 12 years with a metre rise , the researchers say			0
professor @entity110 , of the @entity49 who is coordinating the programme , said : ‘ today as the glaciers and ice sheets lose their ice , the water that they once held has melted and flowed in to rivers and seas , increasing their volume and raising global sea levels			1
‘ current rates of sea level rise are already having impacts on the most vulnerable communities and ecosystems			2
‘ it is likely some future ice loss and sea level rise is now unavoidable			2
ice2sea projections of regional variations in sea - level rise to 2100 : the top image shows the ' mid-range ' scenario of ice loss , and bottom the ' high - end ' scenario			2
these scenarios were developed from ice2sea projections and take account of uncertainty in emissions , global climate , and glacial projections			0
the black lines show the contour of mean global sea - level rise due to continental ice - loss , thermal expansion of the oceans			2
' but nevertheless , understanding why changes are occurring today and how they could increase in the future is the first step in maintaining the security of our coastal regions for future generations			0
’ the researchers said if climate change continued to accelerate , it would lead to bigger sea level rises and more extreme storm surges			0
and they said rises in sea levels would not stop after 2100 , with increases between 2100 and 2200 likely to be much greater than during the 21st century			1
capitals around the world would be hit			0
the team predict the rises could entirely wipe out the @entity94 floods like brought by @entity172 could begin to devastate @entity96 every two years as sea levels rise by five feet by the year 2100 , according to the startling new predictions released by climate scientists			1
the sea level projections mean that much smaller floods will produce more catastrophic effects on the city			0
@entity96 was proven to be extremely vulnerable by the 11 - foot storm surge that battered the city in october			0
the new data could reignite debate over whether the city should construct a $ 17billion system of flood barriers and spend another $ 12billion shoring up outlying areas of the city like the @entity189 .			0

melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century , new predictions claim
@entity14 ’s current sea defences would struggle to cope , with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade
