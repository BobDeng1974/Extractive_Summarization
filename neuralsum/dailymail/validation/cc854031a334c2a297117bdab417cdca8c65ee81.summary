@entity0 and two clubs have been asked to consider proposals allowing @entity4 under - 21 clubs to take part in the @entity6			1
clubs were very much against the addition of @entity4 b teams to the @entity6 pyramid when it was suggested in june 2014 , and this has now been put forward as an alternative			1
the proposal was one of many aired at a recent meeting at @entity16 to discuss issues arising from the @entity20 chairman 's @entity18			0
the @entity6 could involve @entity4 ' b ' teams in future if plans get the go - ahead youth squads from the likes of @entity26 and @entity27 could soon be headed for the lower - tier cup if the @entity6 do bring ' b ' teams into the @entity6 , they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by @entity33 last year , meaning teams would : it would see a change in format for the @entity6 , with a group system being brought in			1
a statement from the @entity6 clarifying the situation read : ' clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 u21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in the @entity6			1
' the competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one @entity51 team in each group , before a knockout stage leading to a final at @entity55			1
' given the previous concerns of the @entity4 and its clubs about @entity4 b teams playing in the pyramid , any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the @entity4 's @entity62 that would protect the current 72 club constitution , save for any changes to promotion / relegation that clubs wished to make			1
' therefore , having provided them with this comfort , clubs willingly debated the potential commercial , financial and player development benefits of having @entity51 teams in this competition from 2015/16			1
@entity74 manager @entity73 holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future fans head to @entity55 for the show - piece final of last year 's competition in march ' no formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken			2
' instead , @entity0 and two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see @entity84 progress the matter , which would include discussions with the @entity4 and @entity20 , so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point			1
' therefore , as yet , no club has voted in favour or against the idea of having @entity51 teams in the @entity6 , they have only indicated whether they wish to consider the matter further			1
' ultimately any changes to this competition will only happen with the support of @entity0 and two clubs			1
' what is the @entity6 ? more commonly known as the @entity6 because of its sponsor , the @entity6 is a competition for the clubs of @entity0 and @entity102			1
the competition is divided into @entity105 sections and runs in a knockout format to a final staged at @entity55			2
this year 's final will be played between @entity109 and @entity110 on march 22			0
@entity74 beat @entity111 3 - 1 in last season 's final			0
what is a category one academy ? those clubs who have academies graded at the highest level under the @entity121 , an initiative introduced in 2011 by the @entity4 to improve the quality and quantity of home - grown players in @entity18			0
@entity128 academies have high contact time with young players , require a minimum of 18 full - time staff and an operational budget of Â£ 2.5m or more			0
which clubs fall into this category ? those that compete in the @entity138 are category one			0
in @entity142 : @entity27 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity26 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152			0
in @entity153 : @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
how would this work ? 16 of these under 21 sides would enter the @entity6			1
the initial part would see 16 groups of four teams , with one under 21 team in each			0
it would then be followed by a knockout stage culminating in the @entity55 final			2
would it be fair ? the current rules for the @entity51 allow teams to field three overage outfield players and one overage goalkeeper			2
that 's why you will sometimes see a player returning from injury or struggling for form playing in an under 21 match			0
so the @entity6 clubs would predominantly be playing against teenage players but potentially with the odd big name thrown in			2
of course , the rules could be altered			0
how would it fit into the calendar ? while some @entity6 clubs take the @entity6 seriously , it is viewed by many as a distraction from the league and other , more prestigious @entity198 competitions			2
some clubs have fielded weakened sides in the competitions in the past			2
crowds are also significantly lower than in other competitions , with a day out at @entity55 the main attraction			0
for the under 21 teams , the games would have to be shoehorned in between @entity4 games , the @entity198 and the @entity209			0

@entity0 and two clubs asked to consider proposals
@entity51 sides would enter the @entity6
addition of ' b ' teams into @entity6 pyramid was *rejected* last year
new format would see @entity51 teams in group stage followed by knockout
