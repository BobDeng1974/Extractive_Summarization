with @entity1 not due to return for @entity2 until next month , if ever there was a time for @entity4 to prove his worth at @entity6 then it is now			1
unfortunately for manager @entity8 it appears that @entity4 ’s surprise selection for @entity2 ’s @entity10 in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity12 on tuesday has done little to repair the shattered confidence that has characterised the 29 - year - old ’s loan spell			1
@entity16 confirmed on friday that @entity17 will not be fit until after the forthcoming international break and although he insisted his decision to play @entity4 in the second string was not intended to humiliate the player , he hinted that the plan may not have worked			1
@entity4 was dumped in @entity2 's under 21s team on tuesday night vs @entity12 @entity4 did not manage to get on the scoresheet against @entity12 's under 21s and was poor @entity2 boss @entity8 says @entity4 's demotion was in order to boost his confidence @entity16 was speaking at @entity2 's pre-match press conference on friday ahead of their clash vs @entity12 6 - @entity8 could oversee an unwanted milestone on sunday , as @entity12 look to make it six games unbeaten against @entity2			1
1921 - the last time @entity12 managed this was a century ago , when they won four and drew two games either side of @entity37 , between february 1914 and october 1921			1
3 - if @entity12 win it will be the first time they have had three consecutive victories at @entity6			1
1 - if @entity12 manage at least a draw , they will become the first team to go six games unbeaten against @entity2 in the @entity45 era			1
' people wrote that it was humiliation to play him in the second team			0
but a lot of players have played there this season			2
' so i do n't think so			0
it just shows a professional attitude of the manager , the staff and the player			0
' @entity60 also played and @entity61			2
@entity61 played a very good match and scored a very good goal so he will now have a better grip on his confidence			2
' that can happen to all the players playing in the second team			0
it 's a lower level and they can play more than the 70 minutes they get in training			0
' @entity4 did not play his best match for the second team but he tried and he did his utmost best			1
' i can not ask for more from him			0
he has shown a professional attitude			0
' we pay a lot of money for the players and so it is normal that they play football for us			0
@entity4 has not reacted to this the way the media has reacted			1
' @entity1 has been sidelined since sustaining an ankle injury against @entity88 on february 21 @entity4 tries to escape from @entity90 duo @entity91 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) on tuesday more than seven months after signing the player , @entity16 is still unable to fathom why he has been unable to replicate the stellar form he showed for @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
' you never can know that , ' @entity16 said when asked why things had not worked out for the 29 - year - old , whom @entity2 have an option to buy for £ 43.2million at the end of the season			1
' we are looking for the solution for him but you can never know that			0
' you can give fantastic performances in another country but not in the country that you are present for			0
' that is not the first example and it will not be the last example			0
a lot of players need more time to adapt to the new situation , new culture , higher rhythm of the @entity122 game and to a lot of aspects			0
' the striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at @entity6 - including in their last two games @entity4 has started the last two games on the bench and @entity16 does not appear to be in any kind of rush to recall the striker			1
' in a club like @entity2 it is more difficult than in a minor club because here he has his competitors , ' @entity16 added			1
' now @entity140 ( @entity141 ) is playing there and @entity140 is scoring so you always have to compare players with each other but you need also luck			0
' he is doing his utmost best and shows a professional attitude , not only @entity4 but all the other players , but you can not always win			2
' with @entity4 only boasting four goals for @entity2 this season , @entity17 ’s absence continues to hurt @entity16 and his team			1
asked about the @entity157 striker ’s possible return against @entity12 tomorrow , he said : ‘ no , he is still with the medical department			2
he ’s training inside , not outside on the pitch			0
it will be the other side of the international break			0
’ @entity16 won a trophy in his first season at @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , but the chances of him doing so at @entity2 are remote			2
@entity4 celebrates scoring against @entity168 , one of only four goals he has netted for @entity2 since joining the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity172 knocked @entity2 out of the @entity173 on monday and in the league , @entity16 's men are 10 points behind @entity177 , who have a match in hand			1
@entity2 are fourth in the standings , just one point ahead of @entity183 , with 10 matches left			2
@entity16 is sure his team 's confidence has not been affected by the cup exit to the @entity188			0
' i have the same confidence as before , ' said @entity16 , who has fixtures against @entity177 , @entity192 and @entity183 after saturday 's home game against @entity12			1
' we were very disappointed at the last game because the players had the feeling that we lost ( because of ) ourselves and not ( because of ) the opponent			0
' but i am very pleased with the reaction from the players this week and i hope we can show that against @entity12 because it is the first of 10 matches we have to play in the rat race			2
