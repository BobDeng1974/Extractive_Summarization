this marks a humiliating blow for the co-op , which was last year awarded the accolade of @entity26 ’s ‘ most sustainable bank ’ by the @entity27 for the third year running			2
the @entity9 's credit ratings agency raised doubts about the co-operative banks ability to raise funds to plug gaps in its balance sheet the lender used @entity35 to reassure its customers that it does not need a taxpayer bailout yesterday the boss of its banking arm , @entity41 , stepped down with immediate effect			1

consumer experts said under the @entity53 customers ’ deposits in co-op licensed accounts are protected up to a total of £ 85,000			2
@entity1 , whose licence also covers @entity59 and the @entity61 online bank , said there had been ‘ no increase in transactions ’ from customers at its branches			1
it said it was ‘ disappointed ’ by the downgrade , adding : ‘ we have a strong funding profile and high levels of liquidity , which are significantly above the regulatory requirements			2
’ in a tweet it also dismissed concerns that it could become the latest lender to require a bail - out			2
‘ we would like to reassure customers and members that we have n’t sought nor do we need government support			0
’ @entity41 today resigned as chief executive of the @entity82 but the co-op acknowledged that it has not set aside enough spare capital to cushion itself against future shocks			1

like other lenders , the co-op is still in the dark about exactly how much it has to raise			0
the @entity111 ’s @entity110 revealed last month that @entity113 lenders have a total shortfall of £ 25billion			1
the @entity115 , the new banking watchdog , will tell individual lenders what their shortfall is in the coming weeks			0

the @entity142 lender ’s downfall was sealed when nervous banks stopped lending to each other , starving it of vital funds			0
but the @entity1 could resort to tapping up parent company @entity147 , which owns a string of businesses			0
it has assets of £ 82billion , including almost £ 7billion which could be used to prop up the bank			1
last night the @entity152 and @entity47 came under fire for accepting the co-op ’s cut - price £ 750million offer to run 632 @entity47 branches			1
state - backed @entity47 was ordered to sell these branches by the @entity159 as a condition of receiving a £ 20billion bailout from @entity113 taxpayers in 2008			1
but the deal , which would have involved the transfer of 4.8million @entity47 customers to the co-op , collapsed last month			1

@entity171 quits as chief executive after @entity9 's downgrade
