a ' mystery haemorrhagic fever ' was flagged up by software nine days before the @entity2 formally announced the @entity4 epidemic			1
the fever was seen developing in the forested areas of southeastern guinea by a free online tool known as @entity9 on march 19			1
the @entity11 group behind the software started putting out alerts and providing information to the @entity2 , which reported its first confirmed case of @entity4 on march 23			1
zoom in on the interactive map to see areas affected by the @entity4 outbreak			1
move the markers on the bottom bar to change the date professor @entity22 , of the @entity23 , who also discovered the ebola virus , said the disease			1
is ' in theory easy to contain '			0
' well it ’s spectacular because once you get it , at least with this strain of @entity4 , you ’ve got like a 90 per cent chance of dying , ' he told @entity34			1
' that ’s spectacular by any standard – one of the most lethal viruses that exist			0
on the other hand , you need really close contact to become infected			0
' so just being on the bus with someone with @entity4 , that ’s not a problem			1
it ’s also not iatrogenic [ ph ] so it ’s not transmitted through , you know , droplets and so on			0
so it is really something that in theory is easy to contain			0
' since then , the @entity9 team has created an interactive @entity4 map , free to use by anyone who wants to see where the disease is spreading			1
the interactive map , run by scientists in @entity58 , uses algorithms to scour tens of thousands of social media sites , local news and government websites to detect and track disease outbreaks			1
it then filters out irrelevant data to identify dangerous diseases and map their locations with the help of health experts			2
' it shows some of these informal sources are helping paint a picture of what 's happening that 's useful to these public health agencies , ' said @entity9 co-founder @entity76			0
@entity9 is operated by a group of 45 researchers , epidemiologists and software developers at @entity81			2
the tool was introduced in 2006 for public health specialists , but that changed as the system evolved and the public became increasingly hungry for information during the swine flu pandemic			2
@entity9 generates information that includes locations of specific outbreaks and tracks new cases and deaths			2
the system is also capable of logging public sentiment			0
users can zoom in on specific countries and regions on the map , with markers showing where the main cases have been reported			1
clicking on a marker directs the users to news reports of the outbreak			2
meanwhile , a scroll bar at the bottom of the map allows you to track the progress of the disease by clicking on key dates			1
the fever was seen developing in the forested areas of southeastern guinea by a free online tool known as @entity9 on march 19 , as shown on this screenshot of the @entity9 the group behind the software started putting out alerts and providing information to the @entity2 , which reported its first confirmed case of @entity4 on march 23			1
by then , the map had tracked 29 cases in @entity118 and 29 deaths - all reported by sources such as social media and local government sites @entity4 emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in @entity134 and near the @entity135 in the @entity136			1
there are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent			0
in the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent			0
it is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy			0
the virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people			0
symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			2
people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days			0
although the disease has no cure , modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down			0
source : @entity2 the @entity4 outbreak , the largest and longest ever recorded for the disease , has so far killed more than 950 people			1
the map shows how it emerged in @entity118 in march and has since spread to @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			1
hospitals in @entity187 are now preparing for the possible spread of @entity189 as the @entity2 said a vaccine could be ' rushed through ' by early next year			2
doctors at the specialised quarantine unit at @entity195 's @entity194 hospital today showed off their readiness , amid news that two @entity198 could be carrying the deadly virus			0
dr @entity200 , a clinical informatics expert at @entity202 who is not part of @entity9 , told the @entity205 there is still work to be done to tune out ' background noise '			0
' you can get early signs , but they 're not always right , ' dr @entity200 said			0
@entity211 , who oversees @entity9 operations , said it 's meant to be used alongside conventional health reports rather than replace them			0
the @entity9 team are now working on software to allow researchers to forecast where an outbreak is headed and when ahead of this coming flu season			2

fever was seen developing in the forested areas of @entity118 by an online disease - *monitoring* tool on march 19
group behind software alerted the @entity2 , which reported first @entity4 case on march 23
