' when you look at @entity4 they should be trying to win the title			1
' i ’m sure @entity37 , the fans and the board want more			0
you can be upset at @entity4 losing to @entity41 but it is the way they went after @entity37 and the words they used			1
' they are not far but they are missing a big piece			0
they are missing a ( @entity19 ) @entity19 and a @entity20			0
' those guys would have done anything to allow us to perform well			0
they protected the back four			2
do @entity4 have that now , i do n’t think so			2
' @entity0 believes @entity4 made a big mistake selling @entity51 and that he would be perfect for the side now the former @entity4 striker in action for the @entity55 in a 3 - 1 win against @entity8 in may 2006 a graphic showing @entity4 's dreadful record in the at the home of the two @entity61 clubs @entity0 went on to lavish praise on former @entity4 midfielder song by claiming the @entity65 loanee would improve @entity67 's side			1

' that is the type of player you want in front of your back four			0

you need someone to dictate , put players into position , make little fouls by kicking someone - like @entity80 used to do			0

i was playing before and @entity9 too			2
' your pride has to kick in			0
forget even about the @entity22			0
if i was at home and i was playing against my brother - one day , you have to go out there and prove you are a good team against a good team			1
that 's not an easy task and hopefully they are going to do it today			2
' @entity9 , meanwhile , believes @entity4 are too nice to compete for the @entity22 title and @entity0 did not disagree with his new colleague			1
' @entity4 historically are too easy to play against , ' stated @entity9			1
' i am a fan of @entity4 but they frustrate the life out of me			2
' would you like your daughter to date any of the @entity4 players ? they are a team of son - in - laws			1
' they are all nice guys			0
' @entity0 believes @entity110 , pictured celebrating after scoring at the @entity87 , makes @entity4 ' tick ' @entity112 applauds @entity4 's travelling support at the end of the @entity22 clash @entity0 may just be @entity4 's lucky charm as his former side delivered an impressive performance to claim a 2 - 0 win at the home of the champions			1

@entity0 said after the match : ' @entity4 usually play with the ball but they were brilliant			1
they did n't have the ball for most of the game but the 32 per cent possession was enough to win the game			0
' what a game @entity110 had today			2
people mention @entity132 but do n't forget @entity110			2
' he is the man who makes the team tick			0
the only thing he did n't do well was the dance			0
' @entity9 added : ' the word that jumps out is disciplined			2
they denied space all over the pitch in a very un-arsenal way			0
they defended brilliantly and never allowed any space			0
if they could just bottle it , then they would be a major threat			0
' the only thing @entity110 done wrong during the game was his jig , joked @entity0			1
