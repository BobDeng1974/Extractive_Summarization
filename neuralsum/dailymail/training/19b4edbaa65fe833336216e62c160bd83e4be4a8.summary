by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 31 may 2013 she 's only a year old , yet @entity2 has mastered flying , can wield a sword like a ninja , and even do a spot of @entity6			1
yet @entity2 's prodigious skills are actually the result of the lengths her father went to to make his little girl smile			2
@entity12 photographer @entity11 and his partner @entity13 , both 25 , wanted a family album with a difference			1
with a little help from @entity19 , their daughter looks capable beyond her years			0
@entity2 was only five months old when this was taken , looking as though she was tackling her parents ' decorating with ease			2
thanks to @entity19 , her mother @entity13 was taken out of the picture so it looked like @entity28 was standing up by herself photographer @entity11 also transformed his daughter into a mechanic for a fun family album @entity2 is also seen getting up to magical mischief while her mother @entity13 sleeps a black babygro and a sword make @entity28 into a fruit - slicing ninja some photos were taken before @entity2 could even crawl or hold her own head up , so she needed a helping hand from an adult - who was then removed from the picture with digital software			1
mr @entity11 said : ' it 's just so much fun			2
there is nothing serious about these pictures and that shows when we take them			0
' the only thing that usually is in my mind when i take them is to get as funny face as possible from the baby			0
' when @entity13 was pregnant with our baby i came up with many ideas that i wanted to do once the baby arrived			0
he added : ' in @entity12 we have some really funny commercials and i always wanted to do something like that , but with babies instead of grown - ups			1
watch out mum , @entity28 's about to cause a splash signhild the @entity69 - and she 's got the cape and headgear for the job another photo shows @entity28 and her monkey friend wearing the results of a snacking session an army of @entity79 took over her first birthday party , holding her parents @entity11 and @entity13 hostage ' sometimes the ideas just come when i 'm doing something completely different and sometimes i just sit down and try to come up with ideas			1
' mr @entity11 and his partner are expecting another child , so soon @entity28 will have a younger sibling , which could lead to more photographic fun			2
he said : ' i 'm all about the baby 's expressions			0
i just love to find a face that fits with the environment they are in			0
' they make me happy when i look at them , and if other people do , i guess i 've succeeded			0
' this snap makes it look like @entity28 decided to hang out in the living room she 's not just a decorator and mechanic - @entity28 is clearly a enthusiastic baker , too the family photo that did n't need any digital help : @entity11 and @entity13 with one - year - old @entity2			1

@entity11 's family album shows daughter @entity2 , one , up to all sorts
the photographer was *inspired* by funny @entity12 commercials
photoshop work makes it look like @entity28 is doing it all by herself
