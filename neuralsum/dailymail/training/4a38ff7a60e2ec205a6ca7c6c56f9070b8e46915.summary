fiddler : @entity2 's job at the @entity3 was to investigate dole fiddlers and bring them to justice @entity2 could never be accused of not wanting to take his work home with him			1
his job at the @entity3 was to make key decisions on benefit payouts and help root out fraudsters			0
but the former policeman ended up in the dock himself for fraudulently claiming over £ 10,500 in disability benefits for a ' bad back ' - the very swindle he was employed to prevent			1
he claimed that a back injury suffered during his police career meant he could only walk 40 yards in three minutes and could not wash or shower properly			1
however , colleagues in the @entity3 grew suspicious and mounted surveillance on him filming the 70 - year - old walking his dog and going shopping			1
he was soon arrested for fraudulently claiming £ 10,672 in @entity25			2
@entity26 , prosecuting for the @entity3 , told the court : ' in his job @entity2 would look at people ’s claims , he would take statements and give evidence in court against fraudsters			1
' but , all that time he was claiming himself			0
the @entity3 started surveillance on him and had him covertly filmed			2
' in addition to the video footage some twenty of his colleagues were asked about his condition at work and some said he had been moving around freely at work and did not need a stick			1
' but none of them knew he was claiming @entity47 at the higher rate and it was clear to them that he would not have been entitled to such benefits			2
' the magistrates watched footage of @entity2 walking with ease , pushing a shopping trolley and taking his dog on a lead on a trip to the @entity59			1
however , colleagues in the @entity3 grew suspicious and mounted surveillance on him filming the 70 - year - old walking his dog and going shopping @entity2 pleaded guilty to failing to tell the @entity3 about a change in his circumstances - namely a change in his physical capabilities and that his mobility needs had decreased knowing that would have affected his entitlement to state benefits			1
@entity75 , defending , said his client had suffered an injury while working as a policeman and had since suffered anxiety and depression			0
the lawyer said : ' this is not all a figment of his imagination			0
he even had to have a specially designed desk at work to assist him			2
sprightly : the magistrates watched footage of @entity2 walking with ease , pushing a shopping trolley and taking his dog on a lead on a trip to the @entity59 ' when he was working for the @entity3 he took time off work sick and his gp told him to get out and about more			1
he found his condition improved as a result			0
it is all a matter of degrees of improvement , but he does accept he should not have continued on the higher rate allowance			0
' over the time he got better when he thought he would get worse			0
' he has put people in the dock and now he sits there himself thoroughly ashamed at getting his first conviction			0
' mr @entity75 said that that @entity2 - now retired - had paid back the money			1
nice car : @entity2 's 4x4 parked in a disabled bay sentencing @entity2 to nine weeks imprisonment suspended for two years and an eight week curfew , chair of the magistrates mrs @entity109 told him : ' in my seventeen years as a magistrate i have never come across a worse case than this			1
' it was a gross breach of trust for a man in your work and it took place over a long period of time			2
you were within a whisker of going to jail			0
' after leaving @entity128 joined the @entity3 anti fraud unit			0
while investigating and exposing false claims on the @entity131 , married @entity2 from @entity132 , near @entity133 , @entity134 , did exactly the same himself			2
