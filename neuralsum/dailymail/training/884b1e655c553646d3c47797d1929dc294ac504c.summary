on an afternoon when @entity1 enjoyed an absurd amount of possession and again collected another three points in what appears a monopolistic title race , it ’d be easy to overlook one man			2
he sits in front of @entity10 and @entity11 with a sole purpose : to patrol the width of @entity14 and not give an inch			1
@entity16 performs this role so effectively that @entity18 need n’t worry about teams travelling to west @entity20 in pursuit of catching the @entity23 cold			2
@entity16 in action for @entity1 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity27 on saturday @entity16 shows his strength in rising for a header against @entity27 's target man @entity30 @entity16 's heat map in midfield for @entity1 against @entity27 via @entity33 yes , @entity34 brilliantly equalised here with the sort of improvised flick only a poacher knows how , but the way in which @entity1 set up means they wo n’t drop many points in front of their own fans			1
@entity16 sits alongside @entity46 - who has now managed as many assists this campaign than @entity49 registered in the entirety of last - and allows the @entity51 to flourish			1
there had been question marks in august as to how the pair work together			0
@entity46 is the sort of central midfielder insistent on hunting down causes - lost or otherwise			0
@entity16 was also tasked with going and affecting the game higher up the pitch and @entity18 ’s side were , on occasion , left bare			2
the manager spotted that quickly			0
the solution has been to afford @entity46 the chance to do his thing while @entity16 sits a little deeper			1
@entity16 pursues opposition midfielder @entity68 of @entity27 ( right ) in the centre of the park @entity16 's defence and disclipine stats against @entity27 on saturday via @entity33 @entity33 's attacking stats against @entity27 on saturday via @entity33 @entity16 competes for the ball with @entity27 striker @entity34 ( left ) during the second half he has flourished , again laying on for @entity76 to score a sumptuous opener with the outside of his right foot against @entity27			1
you ’ll struggle to see a better goal up and down the country this weekend			0
that ’s thanks in no small part to the @entity86 , who is the master of retaining possession but also with the quickness of thought to notice runners around him			0
@entity93 said in a newspaper column last week that @entity16 is already better than @entity95			1
that may be premature at this stage , but all the signs are that the 26 - year - old come become just as important			0
after all , every title - winning side needs one			0
to just highlight his intelligence , @entity16 made sure he fouled the breaking @entity34 on halfway as we crept into stoppage time at 2 - 1			1
@entity27 looked dangerous , but the destroyer hauled @entity107 down			2
a crucial break in play ensued and the resulting free - kick came to nothing			0
there may be @entity46 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity76 ahead of him , but it ’s the finer details to @entity16 ’s game that may prove decisive in games much bigger than this			0
@entity1 's @entity16 under pressure from @entity27 ' @entity121 as he tries to regain possession @entity16 provides the perfect platform for his midfield partner @entity46 ( left ) to flourish			1

@entity16 sits *superbly* in front of @entity10 and @entity11
he 's so assured in the role that he has been compared to @entity95
@entity1 beat @entity27 2 - 1 at @entity14 on saturday
