the next time @entity1 feels the need to justify his continued presence in @entity4 – and that time will come – he has some useful numbers to roll out			0
as of tuesday night , the most pertinent one available to him is 115			0
that is the number of goals @entity1 's @entity11 team have scored so far this season , a number plenty enough to take them in to the last four of the @entity14 , the semi-final of the @entity16 and to the cusp of successive @entity19 titles			1
it 's a funny game , football is n't it ? people can grow restless , unhappy even , pretty quickly			0
as @entity1 himself said on the eve of this undressing of porous @entity28 , people are only happy here if @entity11 win the treble			2
@entity11 's @entity31 jumps highest to head the home side ahead on 14 minutes and set the @entity34 giants on their way former @entity37 midfielder @entity31 races away to celebrate and clenches his fist after giving @entity11 the lead on the night @entity11 defender @entity40 scores the second header of the evening to double @entity11 's advantage and level the tie at 3 - 3 @entity40 points to the skies in celebration after the @entity48 international 's goal gave @entity11 the initiative as they led on away goals @entity51 made it a hat - trick of @entity11 headers on 27 minutes as the @entity56 striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net @entity59 shoots and scores to give @entity11 an incredible 4 - 0 lead with 10 minutes of the first half still remaining @entity59 lets out a roar in celebration and is congratulated by fellow goalscorer @entity31 as the @entity65 took full control of tuesday 's tie @entity51 powerfully strikes from inside the area to give @entity11 a 5 - 0 lead at half - time as the frontman netted his second @entity51 slides on his knees in front of the @entity76 crowd after scoring his second goal of the night as @entity11 raced away the @entity11 frontman is congratulated by @entity79 ( left ) , defender @entity80 ( centre ) and @entity59 ( right ) after scoring @entity83 replies for @entity28 but the goal was just a consolation as the @entity87 giants failed to stage an unlikely comeback in @entity89 @entity11 midfielder @entity90 bends the ball past the @entity28 wall to score his side 's six goal of the evening with two minutes to go @entity90 jumps in celebration and points to the sky as captain @entity98 races over to congratulate the @entity100 midfielder @entity11 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity101 6 , @entity80 7 , ( @entity102 72 , 6 ) @entity40 7.5 , @entity103 7 , @entity104 7 , @entity98 7 , @entity90 7.5 , @entity31 7.5 ( @entity105 90 ) , @entity59 8 , @entity106 8 ( @entity107 86 ) , @entity51 8.5 subs not used : @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112			1

@entity28 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity116 4 , @entity117 4 ( @entity118 33 , 6 ) , @entity119 5 , @entity120 4.5 , @entity121 5 , @entity122 5 , @entity123 4.5 , @entity124 5 , @entity125 5 ( @entity126 46 , 6 ) , @entity83 5 , @entity127 5 ( @entity128 67 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 scorer : @entity83 , 73			1

sent off : @entity120 manager : @entity136 , 5 man of the match : @entity51 referee : @entity140 ( @entity141 ) 8 attendance : 70,000 well , despite the horrors of the 3 - 1 first leg defeat in @entity87 last week , that remains very much on and the statistics show that @entity1 and his players have indulged in a fair amount of self - expression along the way			1
@entity1 wo n't remember all the season 's goals			0
he wo n't remember all of the seven @entity11 scored against @entity153 and against @entity154 , the eight they plundered at home to @entity156 or the six they put past @entity157			2
the @entity158 will remember the half dozen his team scored here on tuesday night , though			2
he will remember them - especially the five that came in a brutal , spellbinding opening half - because they will be set against the background of last week 's defeat and the disgruntlement that followed			1
questions were asked about his own future , @entity11 's club doctor walked out , slamming the door behind him			1
by half - time , though , those matters seemed rather distant already and that is what brilliant football does			1
it makes people forget the small details			0
that , in a way , is the whole point of sport			0
certain @entity11 's rather entitled supporters will have seen little better than this over the years			1
not just because of the quality of the football but because of the context and because of the sheer hunger and monotonous forward drive of this team			0
' i knew my players could do this , ' said @entity1 afterwards			0
' but this was not perfect			0
' having started so badly in the first leg last week – @entity11 were two down early – they needed to reverse things quickly			2
after 23 minutes they were two goals up and , from that point on , the contest was no longer valid			0
@entity51 had already struck the post when @entity11 took the lead , left - back @entity104 crossing to the near post for @entity31 to thump in a header			1
the goal served to break the tension a little and as @entity28 failed to settle , @entity11 began a hypnotic and relentless journey through the gears			2
a shot from @entity59 was saved by @entity116 soon after but that proved a rare moment of competence for the @entity28 goalkeeper			2
he had a poor night and was beaten for the second time midway through the half when @entity40 glanced a header in by the post after a corner			2
at this point , @entity11 were already mathematically through			0
@entity28 needed to score to maintain an interest but they were too skittish , too panicked and too intent in arguing with referee @entity140 to ever get a foothold in a game that quickly galloped away from them			0
@entity11 celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach the @entity14 semi-finals @entity59 celebrates with supporters at the full - time whistle while @entity28 defender @entity119 looks dejected as @entity28 surrendered a first leg lead @entity28 's @entity234 frontman @entity127 looks to control the ball in the air under pressure from @entity11 right back @entity80 @entity125 , who scored twice in @entity28 's first leg victory , attempts to get the better of @entity11 's @entity100 left back @entity104 @entity28 defender @entity117 slides in to a challenge to dispossess @entity11 frontman @entity79 during the first half @entity241 international @entity83 , who scored @entity28 's third goal in the first leg , controls and shields the ball from @entity80 the third goal arrived soon after – @entity51 finishing first time after @entity98 had set him up beautifully – and it was at this point a massacre seemed in the offing			1
a drive from @entity59 from distance then struck defender @entity123 and span through @entity116 's flapping legs in the 36th minute and , after a rare @entity28 attack culminated in a dive by , and a booking for , @entity83 , @entity51 struck again , teasing two defenders before arrowing a perfect shot in to the corner with his right foot			1
half - time found the @entity87 on their knees and they crawled to the dressing room			1
beyond that , @entity11 lost some momentum and @entity28 even scored a goal , @entity83 heading in			1
on the touchline , however , @entity1 's greatest inconvenience was a split to the seam of his suit trousers			0
as time wore on , he continued to instruct his players feverishly			0
at times he must be exhausting to play for			0
in the stands here , meanwhile , @entity276 's football director @entity275 looked on covetously as @entity90 curled in a free - kick at the death after the dismissal of @entity120			1
@entity276 , as we know , could do with a man like @entity1			0
@entity28 duo @entity124 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) look dejected as @entity11 stormed into a 5 - 0 lead at half time @entity11 manager @entity1 holds his head in his hands after a missed chance having ripped his trousers in celebration @entity1 gives captain @entity98 instructions on the touchline as @entity79 , @entity31 and @entity59 take a breather during a break in play @entity28 manager @entity136 and @entity11 boss @entity298 - former @entity37 team - mates - share a joke ahead of the game @entity79 ( on the left of the middle row ) posted this picture of the @entity11 celebrations on @entity305 injured trio @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity309 chat in the home team dugout ahead of @entity11 's quarter - final tie @entity313 international @entity312 , who was also sidelined through injury , was a pundit alongside @entity315 ( right ) on tuesday evening			1

@entity11 5 - 0 up at half - time as @entity51 ( 2 ) , @entity59 , @entity31 and @entity40 scored
former @entity320 and @entity321 midfielder @entity90 scored @entity11 's sixth in the closing stages
@entity28 had gone in to the match with a 3 - 1 lead from last week 's first leg in @entity328
@entity241 international @entity83 scored a consolation for @entity28 with seventeen minutes to go
@entity28 's @entity100 defender @entity120 was dismissed in the 86th minute after picking up two bookings
