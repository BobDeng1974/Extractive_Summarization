if you 're single and struggling to find a girlfriend , you might want to consider a change of profession			0
because a study has found that women are more attracted to men who display heroic traits such as war heroes , successful sportsmen and firemen			1
however , the study found the opposite was n't true , and men did not find heroism to be a sexually attractive trait in women			1
phwoar : a study by the @entity19 says women prefer war heroes			1
they are also attracted to other heroic professions like being a fireman			1
however , men prefer women to not be in a heroic profession			1
' only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism , ' said dr @entity29 from the university the study was carried out by the @entity19 and published in the journal @entity33			1
in the research 92 women studying in the @entity35 were presented with hypothetical profiles of the opposite sex , representing varying levels of heroism in different contexts such as warfare , sport and business			2
they were then asked a series of questions designed to determine how attracted they were to the different profiles			0
women were more likely to find a soldier attractive , and were more inclined to date him , if he had been awarded a medal for bravery in combat			0
ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male - dominated industries , according to a controversial study			2
research by professor @entity60 , a psychologist at @entity61 , suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women			2
she asked women to apply for leadership roles in male - dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates ' suitability			0
some of the women were asked to emphasise ' masculine - like ' traits such as assertiveness , independence and raw ambition			0
others were asked to display more ' feminine traits ' - warmth , supportiveness and a nurturing nature			0
the panel , irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it , decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process			0
but whether or not a non-decorated soldier had seen combat in a warzone or remained in the @entity35 did not have a statistically significant effect on his attractiveness			0
displays of heroism in other fields , such as in sports or in business , also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive			2
in a subsequent experiment by the researchers , 159 women and 181 men studying in @entity108 took part in a similar exercise to determine their level of sexual attraction to the opposite sex			2
this time , the soldier profiles displayed various levels of bravery , either in combat or by helping in a natural disaster zone			0
again , heroism in combat increased women 's levels of sexual attraction towards male soldiers , but heroism in a disaster zone had no impact			2
female heroes , both in combat and in disaster zones , were deemed less attractive by men than their non-hero counterparts			2
' this provides evidence for the hypothesis that gender differences in intergroup conflict can have an evolutionary origin , as only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism , ' said dr @entity29 , a psychologist at the @entity19			1
' in light of the physical dangers and reproductive risks involved , participating in intergroup aggression might not generally be a viable reproductive strategy for women			0
' @entity148 also seems to be a context - specific signal , as it only had an effect on attractiveness in a setting of intergroup conflict			0
' indeed , soldiers who displayed heroism were only considered to be more attractive when this was displayed in a warfare context and not in another situation which is frequently associated with the army - helping during and after natural disasters			0
' hot stuff : being a fireman ( stock image shown ) was one profession rated as being attractive by women in the study			1
however , displays of heroism in other fields , such as in sports or in business , also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive the experiments follow on from a historical analysis undertaken by the research team , which looked at numbers of children fathered by @entity180 @entity182 recipients in the @entity183 compared to the numbers of children fathered by regular veterans			1
the analysis shows @entity182 recipients had an average of 3.18 children , while regular veterans averaged 2.72 children , suggesting decorated war heroes sired more offspring than other veterans			1
' raids , battles , and ambushes in ancestral environments , and wars in modern environments , may provide an arena for men to signal their physical and psychological strengths , ' said dr @entity29			1
' of course , women may not always witness these heroic acts in person , but such information is likely to be widely communicated within a tribal community , particularly when the actions of male warriors are outstandingly brave			0
' the study team was made up of researchers from the @entity19 , @entity35 ; @entity211 , @entity212 ; @entity213 , @entity212 ; and @entity214 , the @entity215 .			1

study by @entity19 says women prefer war heroes
they are also attracted to other heroic professions like being a fireman
however , men prefer women to not be in a heroic profession
' only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism , ' said dr @entity29 from the university
the team also found @entity182 recipients had more children
