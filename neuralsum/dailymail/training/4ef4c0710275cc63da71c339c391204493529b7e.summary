a @entity1 - led operation has disrupted an international crime ring that infected hundreds of thousands of pcs across the globe with malicious software that stole more than $ 100 million from businesses and members of the public since 2011			1
the @entity9 announced on monday that anywhere between 500,000 and 1 million machines worldwide were affected by the virus 's known as @entity13 which stole banking passwords and @entity15 , which encrypted files and blackmailed the users for their release			1
among the victims of the cyber-attacks were @entity19 based @entity22 of @entity23 , which lost $ 373,000 in one money transfer and the @entity27 , @entity26 police department , which paid a $ 750 ransom after their computers were infected			1
authorities in nearly a dozen countries worked with private security companies to wrest control of the network of infected machines			0
' these schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative , and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt , ' said @entity50 , who heads the @entity9 's criminal division , to a news conference			0
but while the grip of those behind the ' malware ' has been weakened by the counter attack , computer experts said users must take this opportunity to install anti-virus software and update their operating systems to the latest versions to stop it regaining its hold			1
' the criminals effectively held for ransom every private email , business plan , child 's science project , or family photograph - every single important and personal file stored on the victim 's computer , ' @entity50 , the head of the @entity9 's criminal division , said at a news conference			1
those who fail to do so risk having their valuable data , including precious photographs , music and personal files held to ransom			2
in the worst cases , victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained by the criminal network			2
the @entity13 software , has spread worldwide but has been temporarily disabled by the international effort by law enforcement agencies			1
potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers rebuild the network			1
hackers will be able to install new ones , but it is thought that there will be a window of opportunity of at least two weeks for computer users to protect themselves			0
many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers			0
the software installs itself on a computer when the victim clicks on a link in an unsolicited email or via a website			1
it then sends out more emails to lure further victims , without the knowledge of the computer users , and spreads quickly across the internet			0
in the worst cases , victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained could @entity120 @entity119 , pictured , be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic ? he is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic			1
but the @entity124 has already spent years looking for @entity120 @entity119 who uses the online names ‘ lucky12345 ’ and ‘ slavik ’			1
the 30 - year - old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘ racketeering enterprise ’ that installed malicious software known as ‘ @entity131 ’ on victims ’ computers			1
the software was used to capture bank account numbers , passwords , personal identification numbers , and other information needed to log into online banking accounts			0
the @entity124 believes @entity119 knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails , which contained links to compromised websites			0
victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware , which @entity119 and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims ’ bank accounts			1
this online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the @entity124 since the summer of @entity157 in september 2011 , the @entity124 began investigating a modified version of the @entity159 , known as @entity13 ( @entity160 )			1
it is believed @entity160 is responsible for more than one million computer infections , resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars			0
on august 22 , 2012 , @entity119 was indicted under the nickname ‘ lucky12345 ’ by a federal grand jury in the @entity166 on a number of charges including @entity169 , conspiracy to violate the @entity171 and @entity172			0
on may 19 , 2014 , @entity119 was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the @entity175 on charges of @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity177 , @entity169 and @entity178			0
then just days ago on may 30 , a criminal complaint was issued in the @entity166 that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘ lucky12345 ’ to @entity119 and charges him with conspiracy to @entity183			0
he is described as white with brown hair ( though his head is usually shaved ) and brown eyes			0
he is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds ( 82kg )			0
@entity119 was last known to live in @entity187 , @entity120			1
he is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the @entity190 in his boat			0
he also owns property in @entity193 , @entity120			1
the virus lays dormant until it spots an opportunity to steal personal details such as online banking information and passwords			0
it then transmits this information back to the criminal network who use it to drain the victim ’s accounts			0
in a further twist , if the user is not a ‘ viable ’ victim then the software locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom			2
last night , the @entity9 filed papers accusing a @entity120 named @entity119 as being the leader of the gang behind the software			1
@entity1 officials said @entity119 was last known to be living in the @entity190 resort town of @entity187			0
a civil suit in @entity219 helped authorities get court orders to seize parts of the infected network , and on may 7 , @entity225 authorities seized and copied @entity13 command servers in @entity227 and @entity228 , officials said			2
potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network			1
the @entity1 @entity234 urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers			1
if systems do not offer automatic updates , people should enable it , the department said			0
it also advised changing passwords , as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection			0
the @entity1 @entity234 set up a website to help victims remove the malware , www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus			1
from that website , computer users can download tailored anti-virus software which has been provided for free			2
experts have also warned users to back - up all valuable data			0
many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers			0
he faces criminal charges in @entity19 , where he was named in a 14 - count indictment , and in @entity264 , where a criminal complaint was filed			0
he has not been arrested , but deputy attorney general @entity33 said @entity1 authorities were in contact with @entity120 to try to bring him into custody			2
@entity120 does not extradite accused criminals to other countries , so @entity119 may never be arrested			2
' the criminals effectively held for ransom every private email , business plan , child 's science project , or family photograph - every single important and personal file stored on the victim 's computer , ' @entity50 , the head of the @entity9 's criminal division , said at a news conference			2
the @entity124 called the alleged ringleader , 30 - year - old @entity282 , one of the most prolific cyber criminals in the world and issued a ' wanted ' poster , pictuted , that lists his online monikers and describes him as a boating enthusiast officials say the case is another stark reminder of the evolving cybercrime threat , though it 's unrelated to the recently unsealed cyber-espionage indictment of five @entity296 military hackers accused of stealing trade secrets from @entity1 firms			2
both sets of hackers relied on similar tactics - including sending emails to unsuspecting victims that installed malware - but the @entity296 defendants were government officials who sought information that could bring companies in their country a competitive advantage			1
@entity119 's operation , prosecutors say , consisted of criminals in @entity120 , @entity225 and the @entity314 who were assigned different roles within the conspiracy			2
the @entity1 @entity234 set up a website to help victims remove the malware , www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus .			1

@entity120 - led band of hackers stole $ 100 million through powerful ' @entity13 ' program
the software can also lock computers and demand a ransom to *unlock*
@entity234 has set up a website to help victims and those concerned remove the malware
