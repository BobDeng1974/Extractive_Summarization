five diseases and health conditions not previously linked to smoking are now thought to be caused by the habit , scientists claim			1
the link between cigarettes and lung disease , some cancers , artery disease , heart attacks and stroke is well documented			1
but scientists at the @entity13 have identified smoking is also linked to significantly increased risks of infection , kidney disease , intestinal disease caused by inadequate blood flow , and heart and lung illnesses not previously attributed to tobacco			1
they studied health data from almost one million people , following them for 10 years			0
their findings suggest the number of people dying from smoking each year , across the world , is significantly underestimated			1
a new study , funded by the @entity31 , has found strong evidence to suggest smoking is linked to five extra diseases and illnesses , than was previously thought			1
scientists estimate it means around 60,000 more deaths in @entity39 each year , should be attributed to the habit in the @entity39 , health officials estimate smoking kills around 480,000 people each year			1
research has already established 21 diseases caused by smoking , including 12 types of cancer , six categories of cardiovascular disease , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ @entity53 ] , and pneumonia including influenza			2
in the @entity57 that figure is around 100,000 , while the @entity58 estimate the global figure stands at six million , when taking into account second - hand smoke			2
however , the team of scientists at @entity13 believe those figures could be considerably higher , when taking into account deaths from the five additional health problems , they now believe are closely linked to smoking			0
dr @entity69 , co-author of the study , estimates smoking could be killing around 60,000 extra @entity39 each year - around 13 per cent of the 480,000 deaths currently attributed to the habit each year			1
if applied to the world wide figure , their theory suggests an extra 780,000 across the world could be dying from the affects of smoking each year			2
dr @entity69 , said : ' the number of additional deaths potentially linked to cigarette smoking is substantial			0
' in our study , many excess deaths among smokers were from disease categories that are not currently established as caused by smoking , and we believe there is strong evidence that many of these deaths may have been caused by smoking			2
' if the same is true nationwide , then cigarette smoking may be killing about 60,000 more @entity39 each year than previously estimated , a number greater than the total number who die each year of influenza or liver disease			1
' those taking part in the study were men and women , all aged 55 or older			0
while the link between smoking and lung disease , coronary heart disease and stroke is well documented through past research , this new study found the habit doubled a smoker 's chance of developing kidney failure ( pictured ) as well as hypertensive heart disease , various infections and respiratory illnesses over the course of the decade - long study , more than 180,000 of the participants died			1
researchers found current smokers , as predicted , had death rates almost three times higher than those who had never smoked			0
their findings show the majority of excess deaths in smokers were due to diseases that are established as being caused by smoking , including 12 types of cancer , coronary heart disease , stroke , diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity53 )			1
past studies have already established a link between smoking and 21 different diseases , as recognised by the @entity39 surgeon general			1
they are : this new study , funded by the @entity31 , found strong links between five additional health problems and cigarettes			0
they are : but they also found around 17 per cent of the excess deaths in smokers were due to diseases that have not yet officially been linked to smoking , by the @entity39 surgeon general			2
it means these deaths would not be counted in estimates of the death toll from smoking			2
the scientists noted , in particular , that smoking was found to at least double a person 's risk of death from several causes , including renal failure , intestinal ischemia , hypertensive heart disease , infections and various respiratory diseases , other than @entity53			1
smokers were also six times more likely to die from a rare illness caused by insufficient blood flow to the intestines			1
the risk of death from each of these diseases was found to decline after a person quit the habit			0
the study authors note there is strong evidence that smoking is a cause of death from these five diseases , even though they are not currently included in estimates of deaths caused by smoking			2
smoking was also linked with smaller increases in risk of death from other causes not formally established as caused by smoking , including breast cancer , prostate cancer , and cancers of unknown site			2
the authors conclude that a substantial portion of excess mortality among smokers may be due to diseases not formally established as caused by smoking			0
they add , that if supported by future research , some of the diseases should be included in future estimates of the death toll from smoking			1
the team of researchers also found evidence the habit was linked to increased risk of breast cancer , pictured under the microscope			0
breast cancer is not currently formally linked to smoking in the @entity39 dr @entity213 , an epidemiologist at the @entity31 , which funded the research , told the @entity215 : ' the smoking epidemic is still ongoing , and there is a need to evaluate how smoking is hurting us as a society , to support clinicians and policy making in public health			0
' the study was an observational one , assessing people 's habits and noted statistical correlations between their behaviour and their health			0
correlation does not prove a cause - and - effect relationship			0
as a result these studies are not deemed as strong as experiments where volunteers are given random treatments , with placebo groups included for comparison			0
people can not ethically be instructed to smoke for a study , so much of the data relating to cigarette 's effects on people has to come from observational studies , such as this			0
the study was published in the @entity250 .			0

new study links smoking to *26* diseases - five more than thought in past
link between cigarettes and lung disease , artery disease , heart attacks , stroke and some cancers is well documented
but scientists identified smokers are at double the risk of kidney failure , hypertensive heart disease , infections and extra respiratory problems
also six times more likely to suffer rare condition caused by poor blood flow to the intestines
estimated smoking kills 60,000 more @entity39 than thought each year
if five illnesses are included in smoking death toll , global figure could increase by hundreds of thousands , scientist 's findings suggest
