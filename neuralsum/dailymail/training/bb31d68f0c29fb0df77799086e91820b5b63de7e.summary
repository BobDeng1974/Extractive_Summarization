if you 've ever wondered how close @entity3 ’s landmarks came to being blown up in @entity4 , a new interactive map has the answer			2
the @entity7 project allows people to zoom in on a map of the capital to see the damage inflicted during the heaviest period of bombing by @entity15 planes			2
it was created by a collaboration between dr @entity18 of the @entity19 and the @entity20 , and funded by the charity @entity21			2
try the interactive map below the site can tell people exactly when their area was hit , and even show photos from the period			1
' @entity30 project is mapping the @entity32 bomb census between 7/10/1940 and 06/06/1941 , ' the team say on their site			1
' previously available only by viewing in the @entity34 at @entity20 , @entity7 is making the maps available to citizen researchers , academics and students wanting to explore where the bombs fell and to discover memories and photographs from the period			1
the project has scanned original 1940s bomb census maps , geo - referenced the maps to add their exact location			2
the team then digitally captured the geographical locations of all the falling bombs recorded on the original map , and created an easy to use website and app to display it			1
' we have combined the location of each of the falling bombs over an 8 month period of the @entity4 together with geo - located photographs from the @entity57 and @entity59 - located memories from the @entity61 ’s war archive			2
the @entity7 is using the @entity62			0
the maps are part of an extensive array of material collected during the @entity67 1940 to 1945 , organised by the @entity68 , and are held in @entity69			1
users can manipulate the statistics and see different data , ranging from the entire census to only those bombs dropped			1
' you can explore statistics for different areas and see how many bombs fell in different wards and boroughs in @entity3 as well as read memories of @entity82 contributed to the @entity83 and images from the @entity57 to allow you to visualise what it was like in @entity3 at such a difficult time			1
' the team has also created an augmented reality version for @entity91 mobile phones that uses gps to pinpoint the user			1
tourists can simply point their phone at an area to see if it was bombed , and if it was , find out more			1
the team has also created a mobile phone version that overlays bomb information onto a live video feed taken from the phone 's camera , and using gps to pinpoint the location			1
' the augmented reality view shows you markers hovering over where bombs fell , scaled to show closer locations with larger markers and smaller ones for those further away , ' the developers say			0
' for some more contextual information , where we can , we add a label with the name of the street it fell on			0
if you click on the marker , you ’ll get a bit more information about the bomb and how far away from your location it fell			0
' @entity127 miraculously escaped @entity129 air raids			0
@entity4 ( from the @entity15 word , ' lightning ' ) was the most intense bombing campaign @entity133 has ever seen			0
between 7 september 1940 and 21 may 1941 there were major raids with more than 100 tonnes of high explosives were dropped on 16 @entity133 cities			0
@entity3 , was attacked 71 times and bombed by the @entity139 for 57 consecutive nights			1
more than one million @entity3 houses were destroyed or damaged , and more than 40,000 civilians were killed , almost half of them in @entity3 @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 were also hit eight times , @entity148 six , @entity149 five , @entity150 four , @entity151 three , and there was also at least one large raid on another eight cities			0
deeply - buried shelters provided the most protection against a direct hit , although the government in 1939 refused to allow tube stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel			0
however , by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened			0
each day orderly lines of people queued until 4 pm , when they were allowed to enter the stations , and by mid-september 1939 about 150,000 a night slept in the @entity169			0
despite the blanket bombing of the capital , some landmarks remained intact - such as @entity127 ( right ) , which was virtually unharmed , despite many buildings around it being reduced to rubble during the 57 nights of raid			0
the site give an astonishing view of every bomb records during the @entity129 , and allows users to zoom in viewers can zoom in to see the areas worst hit , with each red dot representing a bomb the astonishing sight reveals the blanketing of bombs @entity15 forces dropped on @entity133 's capital during the @entity129 once an individual bomb has been located , the site shows details of it , and pictures and other information from the surrounding area			2

new site uses data from the @entity69 previously only available to *visitors* to the @entity34
allows @entity82 to search for their home and see if it was bombed
mobile phone app allows tourists to point their phone at a landmark to see if it was bombed
