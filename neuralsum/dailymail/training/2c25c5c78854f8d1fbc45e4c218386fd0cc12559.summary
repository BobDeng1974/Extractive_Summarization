by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 16 january 2013 a major cyber-attack that has been stealing information from high level government computers around the world since 2007 has been discovered			1
@entity6 , which made the discovery , said in addition to diplomatic and governmental agencies of various countries across the world , @entity5 also targeted research institutions , energy and nuclear groups , and trade and aerospace targets			1
the firm even said the malware was used to infiltrate smartphones of government workers to electronically steal information			2
the full extent of the @entity5 operation is revealed in this infographic , showing how it has hit countries across the globe the main objective of the attackers was to gather sensitive documents from the compromised organisations			1
this included geopolitical intelligence , credentials to access classified computer systems , and data from personal mobile devices and network equipment			1
overall , @entity38 said over 7 terabytes , or 7,000gb data has been stolen			1
the primary focus of the campaign was targeting countries in eastern @entity43			2
' @entity44 and countries in @entity46 were targeted , although victims can be found everywhere , including @entity43 and @entity48 ' , said @entity6 , an antivirus software firm which made the discovery			1
' the main objective of the attackers was to gather sensitive documents from the compromised organisations , which included geopolitical intelligence , credentials to access classified computer systems , and data from personal mobile devices and network equipment , ' @entity5 , which has been active since at least 2007 , appears to collect files encrypted with software used by several entities from the @entity59 to @entity60			1
@entity38 said @entity5 also infected smartphones , including @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity65 handsets			0
it is believed to be still operating , although since the research was published , the attackers are believed to have started dismantling the system to protect their identities			1
' the project started in october 2012 , we received a suspicious executable from a partner , ' @entity75 , chief malware expert at @entity6 told @entity77			0
' we checked and began to understand what we had was quite massive - we found 1,000 different files in a few weeks , each of them a personalised email			1
' mr @entity75 said the attacks were highly customised			2
' there are a very limited number of machines , around 1,000 around the world , but every target is carefully selected			0
' ' we extracted language used and found @entity91 was used , with @entity93 words thrown in , such as @entity94 , commonly used among @entity93 programmers			1
' however , we are not pointing fingers at @entity97 - just that @entity93 language has been spotted			1
' it could be any organisation or country behind this , it could be nation states or a private business or criminal group			2
one of the fake emails used to infect computers @entity5 is a malware attack			0
initially the malicious code was delivered via e-mail as attachments ( @entity111 , @entity112 and , probably @entity114 documents ) which were rigged with exploit code for known security vulnerabilities in the various applications			0
intended targets received personalised correspondence based on gathered intelligence on individual people ( an example is on the right )			0
these attacks comprised of two major stages : initial infection : right after the victim opens the malicious document on a vulnerable system , the embedded malicious code initiates the setup of the main @entity5 software on the machine			0
this handles further communication with the master servers run by the hackers , and can survive the computer being restarted			0
spying : next , the system receives a number of additional spy modules from the hacker 's server , including modules to handle infection of smartphones - the team said @entity62 , @entity150 phones and @entity65 handsets were seen on the network			2
the specific modules are customised for each mobile depending on the infomration the hackers wanted			0
the main purpose of the spying modules is to steal information			0
all gathered information is packed , encrypted and only then transferred to the @entity5 command servers			0
other modules were designed to target files encrypted using a system known as @entity164 - an encryption standard that used to be in widespread use by intelligence agencies but is now less common the campaign , identified as ' @entity169 ' , short for ' @entity5 ' , is currently still active with data being sent to multiple command - and - control servers , through a configuration which rivals in complexity the infrastructure of the @entity176 malware			1
@entity38 's research indicated there were 55,000 connection targets within 250 different ip addresses			2
most infection connections were found coming from @entity182 , followed by @entity183 and @entity184			0
' there is senstitive geopolitical information being stolen , which is very valuable , ' said mr @entity75			0
@entity189 estimate there were 20 - 30 developers working full time on this , and all were ' very experienced programmers '			0
' over the course of the last five years , we believe several terabytes of data was stolen - it 's massive			1
' since we published the report , we have seen some of the servers are no longer responding			0
' the firm is now working with law enforcement agencies to shut down the remaining servers			2
@entity5 , which is named after the @entity93 submarine featured in the @entity206 novel @entity207 , also has what @entity6 called a unique ' resurrection ' module that hid in @entity212 and @entity213 programmes that allowed the attackers to regain access if the virus was discovered and removed .			1

researchers say the cyber attack has been in operation since 2007 - and is still running
@entity222 described as ' massive ' and has stolen ' several terabytes ' of data
security firm which discovered the attacks claims there is ' strong technical evidence the attackers have @entity93 - speaking *origins* ' - but say a private firm or rogue nation could be behind the network .
targets included diplomatic and governmental agencies of various countries across the world , research institutions , energy and nuclear groups , and trade and aerospace firms
