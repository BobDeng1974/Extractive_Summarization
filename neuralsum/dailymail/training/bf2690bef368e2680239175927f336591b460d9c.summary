a pill to treat or even prevent type 2 diabetes could soon be developed , according to scientists			1
a study on diabetic mice found a compound , produced naturally by the body , successfully restored their normal blood sugar metabolism			1
researchers believe this could lead to people taking the compound like a daily vitamin to stop the condition from developing			1
type 2 diabetes affects more than two million @entity16 and is linked to lifestyle ( picture posed by model performing diabetes test ) the findings have huge implications for the @entity23 where there are at least 2.5million @entity16 who suffer from the disease			1
the compound , nicotinamide mononucleotide ( @entity28 ) , plays a vital role in the way cells use energy			1
scientists in the @entity34 were able to normalise blood sugar levels in diabetic mice by injecting them with the chemical			1
at the same time the jabs lowered raised levels of cholesterol and triglyceride blood fats			1
the researchers are now working on a way of administering @entity28 to mice in drinking water			2
' once we can get a grade of @entity28 that humans can take , we would really like to launch a pilot human study , ' said study leader dr @entity52 , from @entity53 in @entity54			2
@entity56 you have two or more of the following , see your gp for a simple blood test ... classic warning signs for many , the first signs of diabetes are symptoms caused by complications			1
so also watch out for the following ... type 2 diabetes , the most common form of the disease , is linked to an unhealthy lifestyle			1
the @entity34 scientists triggered the condition in young , healthy mice by feeding them a high - fat diet			2
all had reduced levels of a molecule called @entity73 that harvests energy from nutrients and turns it into a form cells can use			2
in both mice and humans , @entity73 is derived from @entity28 made by cells via a chain of biological reactions			2
one of @entity73 's effects is activation of @entity84 , a protein that has been shown to promote healthy metabolism throughout the body			2
although @entity73 is too toxic to be administered directly , the scientists were able to raise its levels in mice by injecting them with @entity28			0
after the treatment , the animals showed dramatically improved responses to glucose			0
in the case of female mice , tests showed their ability to move glucose from the blood to organs and tissues had returned to normal			0
male mice also showed an improvement , but were not completely normalised			0
the gender difference might be explained by hormonal effects , the scientists believe			0
dr @entity108 , also from @entity53 , who co-authored the research published in the journal @entity111 , said : ' i 'm very excited to see these results because the effect of @entity28 is much bigger than other known compounds or chemicals			0
' plus , the fact that the body naturally makes @entity28 is promising for translating these findings into humans			0
' in older mice , around 15 per cent of healthy males fed a normal diet also developed diabetes			1
glucose response improved in these animals after just one injection of @entity28			0
the same treatment had no adverse effects on older mice not suffering from diabetes			1
few elderly female mice developed the disease unless they were switched to a high - fat diet			0
' again , when we injected these females with @entity28 , we came up with a completely normal glucose tolerance curve , ' said dr @entity138 , another member of the @entity53 team			0
' we can also see that the @entity28 has completely reversed and normalised the levels of cholesterol , triglycerides and free fatty acids			0
' people with a good supply of vitamin d have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes , a study has found			1
researchers at the @entity151 , in @entity152 , said the vitamin could have an anti-inflammatory effect			0
study author dr @entity155 , said : ' in the winter months people often do no receive adequate supplies of the vitamin because of a lack of sunlight			0
' if follow - up studies confirm out results , a targeted improvement in the supply of vitamin d to the public could also reduce the risk of developing diabetes			1
' oily fish , eggs and milk products all contain vitamin @entity171 the results will be published in the journal @entity175 .			0
