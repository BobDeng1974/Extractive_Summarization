‘ he did some absolutely outstanding things in the game and then he did some slack and sloppy things			2
‘ i did n’t know what he was booked for and @entity34 ( @entity35 ) had said it was a reaction to their fans			1
he was probably frustrated and angry at the result			2
‘ but i ’ll have another look at it as we ca n’t afford to have silly bookings at this point in the season			2
@entity35 got one the other day and there are a couple of other lads a game away from being suspended			2

‘ we just have to draw a line under it			0
i do n’t want doom and gloom			0
we drew the first two games when i came here			0
