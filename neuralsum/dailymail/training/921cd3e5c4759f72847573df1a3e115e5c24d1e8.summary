by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 30 october 2013 two married councillors have refused calls to stand down - despite moving to a village 150 miles away			1
conservatives @entity4 and @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , retired to the @entity10 village of @entity11 earlier this month			1
but the pair have sparked outrage by saying they will keep their seats on @entity16 - and commute to meetings at the taxpayer 's expense			1
the former mayor and mayoress , who have each served for more than 10 years , will continue to claim allowances of at least £ 4,737 each			1
they will also pocket travel expenses of between £ 130 and £ 175 every time they drive to a meeting			1
this is despite their new phone number not appearing on @entity16 's website			2
instead residents are given phone numbers for two colleagues who still live in @entity7			1
' murky , dirty and puerile ' : how one resident described the decision by councillors @entity4 and @entity6 , pictured , to keep their seats on @entity16 , @entity8 , despite starting a new life 150 miles away ' disgraceful ' : the 300 - mile round trip the pair must take for every meeting , costing taxpayers up to £ 175 mr @entity6 said it was pointless to force the council to pay for a by - election because the @entity46 ward , which the couple represent , will disappear in 2015 under boundary changes			1
he added : ' i was n’t going to stand again in 2015 because my ward was being dismantled and it ’s the same for @entity6			2
' i do n’t think there is a point to standing down - i can still work and be in contact with the other councillors			2
' why have the cost of another election ? it seems a bit stupid			2
' but furious resident @entity60 , 64 , said the councillors ’ relocation was ' murky , dirty and puerile '			0
he said : ' they did n’t have the decency to inform their constituents they were going			0
' i think it ’s a disgraceful situation - how can they honestly say they represent the people of this ward ? ' it ’s a despicable political tactic so they do n’t have to resign for fear of the @entity74 losing their stranglehold of this borough and ca n’t be replaced by @entity78 or @entity79 councillors			1
' they were hardly seen about the ward when they were here			0
if they were honourable , they would resign			2
' the pair are a former mayor and mayoress of @entity16 and mr @entity6 previously served as a @entity8 county councillor			1
mr @entity6 said : ' we put our property up for sale just to see what the market was like and we sold it in two days , which was far quicker than we ever expected			2
' we thought it would take six months to a year - so it pushed us into looking for somewhere far quicker than we wanted to			0
' it ’s just the way things panned out			0
i have got a sister up here and properties are cheaper - it ’s as simple as that , and it will be nice to retire to			0
' the home in @entity11 , @entity10 , where the pair moved earlier this month			1
a round trip to council meetings in @entity7 , @entity8 , will cost taxpayers between £ 130 and £ 175 depending on what car they drive mrs @entity113 was @entity114 of @entity16 in 2008 - 09			1
her husband said : ' why have the cost of another election ? it seems a bit stupid ' the couple can claim 42.9p a mile for travel if they drive a car whose engine is smaller than 1,000cc			1
but they can claim 58.7p a mile - 13.7p more than the government recommends for private firms - if it is larger than 1,200cc , which accounts for most family cars			2
@entity132 councillor for @entity79 @entity133 said : ' i know they have n’t been to @entity136 since may - there was a big meeting about the school and they were not there			0
' if it was my party , i would expect them to stand down			0
if they were still able to regularly attend meetings and give a good service , that ’s ok			0
' the conservative group leader on @entity16 , @entity149 , said : ' it ’s unfortunate , but without knowing the full facts , it ’s difficult to comment			0
' it ’s difficult to ask people to stand for election somewhere that ’s going to disappear			0
' the people who are technically represented by @entity4 and @entity6 wo n’t be in future - it ’s an unusual situation			1
' @entity157 , campaign director of the @entity158 , said : ' councillors living on the other side of the country can not claim to be credible representatives of the local community			0
' claiming travel expenses for a 300 - mile round trip is clearly an unreasonable use of taxpayers ' money			1
the pair should stand down rather than attempting to be absentee politicians at greater expense			0
' if the couple fail to attend meetings for six months they can be automatically disqualified from being a councillor .			0

@entity4 and @entity6 left @entity7 , @entity8 , for @entity10 village
@entity74 will claim £ *9,474* allowances and up to £ 175 a trip in travel
pair insist it would be a waste of money and ' stupid ' to hold by - election
resident : ' it 's disgraceful . if they were honourable , they would resign '
