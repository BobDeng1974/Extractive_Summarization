those seized this week are all men aged 88 , 92 and 94 and living in the southwestern state of @entity14			1
the @entity16 office investigating @entity3 war crimes last year identified 30 former @entity2 ( pictured ) personnel with a recommendation to bring charges against them the three elderly former guards who served at the @entity3 death camp @entity2 in @entity4 where 1.1 million @entity5 were exterminated the arrests follow months of investigations by the country 's central war crimes investigation unit which has zeroed in on some two dozen surviving @entity2 guards ' they are suspected of having participated in murders at the @entity28 ' @entity2 extermination camp in occupied @entity29 , ' said prosecutors in a statement			1
the 94 - year - old is understood to be @entity33 , who lives near @entity34			1
@entity33 , an ethnic @entity16 from @entity35 , became known as a ' bruiser ' in @entity2 due to his alleged love of cruelty for its own sake			1
he is proud of his past			0
he told the @entity42 newspaper in @entity0 last year : ' at the time the @entity16 ethnic group i belonged to had to be tested and i was happy to be a part of that			0
' the three elderly men underwent medical tests and then faced a judge who confirmed their fitness to be detained in a prison hospital			1
there were three other raides in the states of @entity55 and @entity56 - again of suspected war criminals - but no further arrests			2
' @entity60 records and documents from the @entity3 era were seized , and their evaluation is ongoing , ' said the statement about the @entity14 home raids			1
the @entity16 office investigating @entity3 war crimes last year sent files on 30 former @entity2 personnel to state prosecutors with a recommendation to bring charges against them			1

the renewed drive to bring to justice the last surviving perpetrators of the @entity77 follows a 2011 landmark court ruling which established that all former camp guards can be tried irrespective of whether any eyewitnesses were left alive to testify the three former @entity2 guards seized this week are all men aged 88 , 92 and 94 and living in the southwestern state of @entity89 - @entity88 three women among the suspects are expected to be charged later this year , according to prosecution sources			1
ever since @entity95 death camp guard @entity94 was found guilty for his part in the mass murder of 28,000 @entity5 in 2011 , the gloves have come off for @entity16 prosecutors			1
before @entity94 it was vital to have every small detail of what they did backed up with witness statements			0
after @entity94 it is enough to merely prove that suspects were there and helping the machinery of death to function			2
@entity109 , now 92 , is one of the female suspects still awaiting arrest			2
in wartime she was sent to the camp of @entity114 on the outskirts of @entity116			2
the camp , with its gas chamber and vast crematorium for disposing of the corpses of inmates , is still standing in memorial to the 230,000 people murdered there			2
perhaps the most notorious of all the @entity3 concentration camps , 1.1million @entity5 were killed at @entity2			1
the camp consisted of three main parts : @entity2 ( the base camp ) @entity128 ( the extermination camp ) and @entity131 ( the labour camp )			1
during the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous ss - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes			1
it was run by camp commandant @entity139 who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination			2
the camp was liberated by the @entity144 on january 27 1945 , the day was subsequently declared @entity145			1
following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947 @entity0 's @entity3 - hunting agency , based in the southern city of @entity153 , was tipped off by the sleuths of the @entity155 in @entity156 about her past when an informant turned up her old @entity160 in the archive of the former @entity163 secret police of @entity0 in @entity164			1
the card , bearing the number 312 , has been authenticated			0
it carries the inscription : ' the holder is authorised to bear arms ' - meaning she was a pay - grade above ordinary guards usually only permitted to carry a ' schlagstock ' - a ' beating stick			2
' after service in @entity114 she was sent to @entity2 where she was based at @entity2 - the complex where the gas chambers were situated			1
before the camp fell to the @entity181 in january 1945 she was shipped back to @entity0 and escaped justice at the end of the war			2
but officials at the @entity153 authority have , it is understood , testimony from several prisoners now dead that she was a ' cruel ' and ' merciless ' guard who beat prisoners with rawhide whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp where daily ' selections ' were made about who should live and who was to be gassed immediately			0
now wheelchair bound her daughter does n't deny her past but is hoping her lack of memory about the time will keep her from prosecution			0
' we know that my mother had something to do with @entity2			1
we have tried to talk with her about it but her memory does n't really function any more , ' she said			0
female suspect number two is @entity213 , 90 , who now lives in an @entity215 home in northern @entity0 , was also in @entity218 's girl 's organisation and joined the @entity219 in 1940			2
the @entity220 in @entity164 threw up her @entity219 identity card			0
it shows a cold , hard - faced woman who worked in the feared @entity219 under her maiden name of @entity225			0
at @entity226 she was a harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners and who was often in charge of the standing cells - small , dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed in for minor rule infractions			0
it was not uncommon to leave people in these rooms for days on end , causing the death of some or all of those confined			0
she formed a romantic relationship with @entity241 but dropped him when he railed against the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious ' @entity245 ' dr @entity244 on inmates			0
she was a true believe in the @entity3 racial policies that decreed @entity5 , gypsies and @entity249 were ' lesser races ' who deserved nothing else			1
female number three is identified only as @entity254 who served under her maiden name beginning with a at the @entity258 concentration camp for women near @entity164			0
a fanatical @entity3 , she was a dog handler who walked around the camp with an @entity263 that was trained to bite at the privates of inmates			0
female number three is identified only as @entity254 who served under her maiden name beginning with a at the @entity258 concentration camp for women near @entity164 ( pictured ) two statues look towards the incinerator building at @entity258 , located around 60 miles from @entity164 in 1942 she was transferred to @entity2 where she and her dog were rightly feared by the prisoners kept as slaves for the numerous war industry factories which dotted the countryside around the camp			1
one female prisoner after the war testified : ' there was a woman there with a kindly smile that masked a hideous nature			0
she was ramrod straight and had a snarling dog that was indoctrinated to hate the prisoners			0
' we would be forced to stand stock still for hours and if anyone moved in the cold or the heat , the dog was unleashed			0
many people did not survive the maulings			0
' she began an affair with an @entity219 man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant			0
after the war she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for ' mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge			0
' now 94 , she refuses to speak about her terrible past			0

the men , aged 88 , 92 and 94 , were all arrested in @entity89 - @entity14
prosecutors suspect they participated in murders at notorious death camp
around 1.1 million @entity5 were exterminated before @entity2 was liberated
