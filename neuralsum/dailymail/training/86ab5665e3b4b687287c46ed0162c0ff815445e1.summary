by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 15 april 2012 updated : 11:37 est , 15 april 2012 a controversial new book encourages young @entity2 to quiz their grandparents about how much they knew about the horrors of @entity5 in @entity6			1
in his new work ‘ my @entity13 ’ historian @entity7 claims that a staggering 20 to 25 million @entity2 citizens and 10 million soldiers were aware of the @entity12 extermination programme			1
according to the @entity2 magazine @entity14 mr @entity7 said his goal was to smash the last taboo in society so families across the country acknowledge the guilt of grandparents who supported @entity23			1
concentration camp : scenes from the liberation of @entity27 in april 1945			2
young @entity2 are being encouraged to ask their grandparents about how much they were really aware of the holocaust in @entity6 the historian who works at a museum on the @entity32 at @entity33 said times had changed significantly compared with the decades immediately after the war with eyewitnesses from the period now keen to share their memories and feelings as they approach the end of their lives			1
he said : ‘ immediately after the war , conversations about it between parents and children appear to have been impossible because it was all too fresh			2
‘ now the problem is that no one is listening to that generation anymore			2
as a source of information , one 's relatives are largely being ignored			0
but one day it will be too late			0
’ the historian interviewed his own maternal grandparents about their role in the war before cross-referencing their recollections against historical documents including army records and archived material			1
the result , according to the magazine , ‘ is a book that has shed new light on the generation that unquestioningly followed @entity23 , failed to own up to its guilt in the immediate aftermath of the war and , more than six decades on , remains unable to express personal remorse for the civilian casualties of @entity23 's war of aggression , let alone for the @entity70			2
appalling scenes : in his new book historian @entity7 claims that as many as 25 million @entity2 were aware of the @entity12 attrocities taking place against @entity77 mr @entity7 says his own blood relatives were morally ‘ contaminated , ’ like millions of ordinary @entity2 of that period			1
he describes his grandmother @entity80 as a ' committed , almost fanatical @entity12 , ' adding : ‘ no one can say what they would have done			0
but the project was n't an attempt to pass judgment on them but to understand them			0
‘ i believe that people will learn a lot if they understand how their respected and loved parents or grandparents behaved in the face of a totalitarian dictatorship and murderous racial ideology			2
‘ dealing with one 's family history in the @entity12 period in an open , factual and self - critical way is an important contribution to accepting democracy and avoiding a repeat of what happened between 1933 and 1945			0
’ his grandfather , identified only as @entity105 , was a career soldier who , @entity7 discovered , gave evasive answers to his enquiries about his wartime service when massacres of civilians were carried out in @entity111 and @entity112			0
when asked by his grandson if he thought @entity12 racial laws banning @entity77 from public life and systematically expropriating their property were unfair , he said : ‘ no , we did n't regard that as injustice , we had to go with the times and the times were like that			0
the media did n't have the importance then that they do today			0
’ mr @entity124 said his grandfather 's claims of ignorance of massacres in @entity112 were ‘ hardly believable			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity13 was n't lying outright in his interviews , but merely doing what millions of @entity2 had done after the war -- engaging in denial , playing down their role to lessen their responsibility			1
‘ it led to the convenient myth in the immediate aftermath of the war that the entire nation had been duped by a small clique of criminals who bore sole responsibility for the @entity70 -- and that ordinary @entity2 had themselves been victims			1
‘ why did the humanity of my grandparents not rebel against the mass murders and why did n't my grandfather concede guilt or shame or express any sympathy for the victims ? ' he says the overriding aim of his book is to get other @entity2 to question their families before it is too late			1
‘ i think conversations like the ones i carried out will bring relatives together rather than drive a wedge between them , ’ he added .			0
