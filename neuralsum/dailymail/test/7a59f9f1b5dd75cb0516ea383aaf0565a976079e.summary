if anyone can be relied upon to crack a smile in the sometimes overly straight - faced world of professional football , it is lofty @entity6 striker @entity5			1
that is , until somebody tries to imitate his now trademark goal celebrations			0
speaking on @entity12 's @entity11 , the 34 - year - old front man gave an in - depth analysis on where it all went ' horribly wrong ' for @entity16 team - mate @entity15 following his wonder strike against @entity18 at @entity19 last saturday			1
@entity15 ( second right ) celebrates his stunning goal against @entity18 with his @entity6 team - mates @entity5 was at hand to give his verdict on @entity15 's dancing skills on @entity12 's @entity11 chat show @entity5 originally brought the robot celebration into prominence for @entity29 against @entity30 in 2006 and @entity5 was a more than qualified judge for the verdict , as it was his famed robot celebration from @entity29 's 6 - 0 against @entity30 ahead of the 2006 @entity33 that got the revival treatment from his @entity16 pal			1
after appearing on the long - running football chat show the previous weekend , @entity15 was asked by hosts @entity38 and @entity40 to ' do the robot ' if he netted against @entity44 's @entity43 high - flyers			2
after smashing home @entity6 's equaliser from 65 - yards over the head of @entity51 goalkeeper @entity50 , the former @entity46 midfielder ran to the touchline to greet @entity5 , who started on the bench during the 2 - 1 loss for @entity56 ' men			2
the former @entity29 striker even went as far as to highlight where @entity15 was going wrong the former @entity46 and @entity60 striker was less than impressed with @entity15 's efforts to imitate him ' obviously we 're all in agreement it 's a fantastic strike from @entity15 , ' @entity5 admitted			1
less impressed with his post-strike antics , @entity5 's critique on his @entity67 colleague pulled no punches			2
' he goes into the celebration far too quickly			0
' ' as you can see he 's not got his arm in the 90 degree angle that a robot should start			0
' the arms , the shoulders are all coming over in the wrong direction and he just needs to needs to be a bit looser			0
' ' it 's a real shame , because obviously he 's got genuine intent and love for the robot , but he 's just got a lot of it wrong			0
' we 'll look forward to seeing @entity5 show us all how it 's done when he 's next on the score sheet			0
@entity15 ( centre ) re-enacted @entity5 's celebration after letting fly from inside his own half against @entity18 @entity50 was not out of position , but he could n't do anything about @entity15 's sublime strike @entity15 's audacious effort was clocked at more than 45 miles per hour and came from inside his own half			1
