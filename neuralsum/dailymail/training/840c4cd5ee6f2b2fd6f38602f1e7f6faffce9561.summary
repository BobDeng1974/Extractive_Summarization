created by @entity10 artist @entity9 , the ' @entity15 ' is based on the iconic @entity12 maps of the world - but with a modern twist			1
however , @entity9 said he limited himself to just the most popular sites online - including @entity19 - for the project			1
' due to the immense size of the @entity24 , only a miniscule portion of it was chosen to represent it on the map - otherwise , this map would be unreadable and probably undrawable in entire lifespan of average human being , ' @entity9 told @entity19			0
he now hopes to improve the map over time , adding more sites			1
' i started making maps about 2 and half years ago , and it has quickly become my free - time hobby , ' he said			0
' it was my hobby , and it still is my hobby , though i am planning to start selling prints of my maps on @entity40 quite soon			0

most of the map was created in @entity59 , with special software used to create the ornate borders			2
' this poster includes one full map of the internet , 4 minimaps showcasing @entity66 surveillance , most used social networks , most used internet browser , and worldwide internet penetration , list of @entity72 websites , quick timeline of the internet history , top software companies and much more , ' he boasted			1
