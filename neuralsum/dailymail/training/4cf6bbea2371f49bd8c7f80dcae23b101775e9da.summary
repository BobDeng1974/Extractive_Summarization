while @entity4 now look unrecognisable from the disgraced 2010 @entity6 ' team ' , and regardless of what happens in friday 's quarter - final , will return home to an appreciative welcome , the @entity3 ace will probably feel short - changed			1
that is simply his nature			0
the 21 - year old fears no - one and backs himself , permanently and unreservedly			2
his single - mindedness has raised eyebrows , yet , given his spectacular rise and success , does not appear to have harmed him			2
the only way is up : @entity1 points to the heavens after scoring in @entity4 's win against @entity23 eyes on the prize : @entity1 follows the flight of the ball before looping a header to make it 1 - 0 his headed goal against @entity23 last night is another step toward tightening his grip on his place in @entity4 's midfield , within a squad bursting with positivity			1
in many ways , the most exciting element now , for quarter - finalists @entity4 , is what the next tournament holds			1
a future under @entity42 is tantalising with promise , punctuated by the younger and hugely motivated players			0
moreover , this @entity6 has proven those who are bursting onto the scene are capable of carving out victories , not just making individual impressions			2
full flow : @entity1 powers past @entity51 during @entity4 's last - 16 victory at @entity53 technique : the midfielder forced @entity56 into making a fine stop from this well - struck volley mentor : @entity6 winner and current @entity4 boss @entity42 congratulates @entity1 at full - time there was room for both @entity1 and benched @entity65 winger , @entity64 , to start			1
it would n't have been placing all unhatched eggs into one basket			0
yet the eternally inconsistent , always either brilliant or thoroughly pedestrian , @entity69 , started and not until the substitution could @entity71 rifle through the middle in his preferred position			0
@entity1 may feel as if he were slightly isolated in the first half , but trebled his effort after the break and certainly did n't look at risk of receiving a second back - heel nutmeg from @entity80			0
the dynamic among individuals in @entity4 is curious			2
@entity69 smiles , while aware of his dips in form			0
@entity71 is rebuilding his own pride , slowly , the ache of having his dedication , and even ability , questioned during a goalless period for @entity4 which lasted 1,224 minutes , finally ending - after 58 shots – against @entity91 in october last year			1
graceful : @entity1 controls the ball brilliantly during @entity3 ' @entity94 clash against @entity95 formidable : at @entity3 , @entity96 and @entity1 have formed an exceptional central - midfield partnership @entity1 is a talisman , buoyed by a solid two years – and two @entity98 – at @entity3 , adorned with a £ 60million price tag and reported keen interest from @entity101			1
in a similar manner to how the phrase ' complete midfielder ' has been bestowed on @entity107 's @entity106 , it has been afforded to @entity1			2
forward runs , technical ability and the well - handled assurance which comes from being both young and having played at the top level			0
of course , the @entity113 - 20 @entity6 winner is also a complete joy to watch			1
curled free kicks into top netting are one thing , following that curve which , with @entity1 , starts from a skip onto a moving ball and shifts into a volley is poetic			0
let go : @entity1 in action for @entity124 's youth team in an @entity125 semi-final versus @entity101 stalled : but the @entity127 was given few first - team opportunities at @entity129 by sir @entity130 then there 's the love lost in @entity133			1
while @entity124 fans will be looking in healthy anticipation to the fabulous @entity139 master , @entity138 , channel - hopping through highlights of @entity1 's artistry will perhaps grate			1
having completed his transfer to @entity129 in october 2009 , @entity1 went on to score seven goals in 21 appearances for the under - 18 team , prompting sir @entity130 to promote him , alongside three other academy players , to the first team			2
@entity130 saw his remarkable ability early on , tactically observing if @entity1 were to have been held back , he would leave for another club			0
what he may not have accounted for , however , is how ' special treatment ' is exactly why @entity1 looked elsewhere			0
he signed for @entity3 in summer 2012 , complaining of how @entity124 had forced him to train alone , and somehow disrespected his status as ' an athlete , not a footballer '			1
specimen : @entity1 is tall , muscular and quick on the ball , making him a nightmare for his opponents powerful : @entity1 has emerged as one of the most complete midfielders in @entity158 during his time in @entity160 cynics , or perhaps just most of us , who fail to make this professional distinction , predicted another ' @entity165 ' in the making			0
@entity1 's attitude was frequently a point of discussion , the prodigious talent criticised for what many saw as petulance and arrogance , but for @entity3 boss @entity174 , demonstrated an iron - cast ambition			1
@entity174 praised @entity1 for his response to picking up the @entity178 award in december last year , @entity180 's annual award for recognising the best under - 21 footballer in @entity158			2
the player said he wanted to win ' everything ' , and some interpreted this as if the award were a tick in a box rather than an achievement to savour			0
what could have been : @entity124 let @entity1 leave and now he has become a star for club and country @entity174 , in a far more measured way than those who scrutinise each of @entity1 's actions to deride , said it showed hunger and was certainly not disrespectful			1
what is seldom open for debate , is @entity1 's pronounced domestic form			0
few managers are in a position to guarantee first - team football during academy graduates ' contract negotiations , therefore @entity124 fans shrugged him off			1
maybe now , they wonder what could have been .			0

midfielder scored first goal in @entity4 's 2 - 0 win over @entity23 in the last 16
he has flourished at @entity3 after being allowed to leave @entity124
despite his age he is also one of the first names on @entity4 's *teamsheet*
he has been one of @entity4 most impressive players at the @entity6
