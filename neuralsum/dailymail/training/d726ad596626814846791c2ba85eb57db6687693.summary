no longer one of the most natural impulses known to humanity , parenting has become fraught with competitiveness , fads and sky - high levels of anxiety			1
and while it 's a common belief that mother knows best , these latest trends and crazes being adopted by parents may make you think again			1
while some have already hit the @entity16 , others are only just catching on – but all are set to influence how @entity16 parents behave in 2015			1
while you might not actually need to ' eat for two ' the new trend of dieting in pregnancy is highly dangerous one of the most worrying of the looming trends is the so - called ' @entity23 ' , spurred on by the increasing pressure new mothers feel to bounce back into their old size after giving birth			1
mothers - to - be are refusing the extra 300 calories a day recommended by health professionals and dieting instead so they can get back into a bikini within six weeks			1
with online guides to slashing your final trimester calorie intake to as low as 1,200 a day , women are existing on green tea and low fat , low carb diets at the one time they should be eating well to nourish their baby			1
women are also increasingly willing to work against their natural fertility or ' biological clocks ' , with more planning to have a baby over the age of 45 and an increase in ' sharenting '			1
the experience of giving birth is now often immortalised on film and in social media snaps - meaning increasing numbers of women are concern with how they look and even what they are wearing in labour with one in five women now childless at 40 , there 's a growing trend for families to ' share ' their kids with child - free friends			1
encompassing the role of godparent , favourite aunt and babysitter , so - called ' sharenting ' lets childless women enjoy the love and benefits of parenthood without the emotional upheaval or expense			1
but for those women who want their own baby , having offspring later in life looks set to become increasingly common			1
poster girls include oscar winning actress @entity80 who had her second child at 47 and author @entity82 who gave birth to a son at 45 and a daughter at 48			1
and do n't forget the dads – @entity87 had daughter @entity88 at 61 , while @entity90 supremo @entity89 became a dad at 69			2
but not all the parenting trends set to hit @entity16 shores are so serious in nature			1
more and more women , like @entity80 ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) are having children later in life there is a rise in vanity in the delivery room , with expectant mothers planning fashionable birthing outfits ( the most popular include bikini tops with frilled skirts on a string without the knickers ) , filming their labour and even undergoing full makeovers in the delivery suite			1
some of the @entity16 's top hospitals are allowing new mothers to have @entity113 and blow - dries immediately after birth			1
the controversial – and highly expensive - packages are only available to those in the know			2
gender neutral parenting means no giving your child stereotypical toys already popular with celebrities and high flyers who want to look picture perfect post-partum , the trend is set to spread to others as the pressure to appear stunning after labour grows			1
the ultimate selfie , labour videos inspired by hit tv shows @entity132 chart the stages of labour from the first contractions until the placenta is delivered			0
to be shared on your child 's 18th birthday and online with friends for maximum impact			0
but the parenting fads do n't stop at the maternity ward door			1
one craze becoming popular is that of gender neutral parenting , where parents raise their children using only gender - neutral toys , clothes and terms in an effort to removed socialized gender steryotypes			1
this can become as extreme as refusing to tell the child what sex they are , or families who treat a child as girls one day and boys the next until they discover what ' suits ' them			0
a particularly creepy trend heading over from @entity166 is that of ' reborn dolls ' of your own children costing up to £ 5,000 each , this expensive trend allows parents to buy dolls made in the exact image of their own child as a newborn			2
the dolls creators say it 's most popular with mothers who are just seeing their youngest child leave the nest , , so they can keep the ' little one ' of the family little forever			2
on a similar thread is the fashion of printing out your child in @entity186			0
as well as parents new love of uploading constant snaps to social media , the newest way to keep hold of happy family memories is to make models of your kids using a 3d printer			2
the mini-me models can be printed from any digital pic for around £ 60			0
with supermarkets now offering an in - store service , expect minifigs of your kids at every stage from newborn to 21st birthday to be one of the fastest growing trends next year			2
then , once you have perfectly preserved your gender neutral child in numerous forms , you can begin living , vicariously through them			1
another trend is that of professional level sports for children			0
forget egg and spoon races at the local sports day , activities for children are increasingly professional and competitive similar to the notorious @entity226 in @entity166 , leagues for child sports and mini marathons and triathalons for tots are growing			0
from the rise of competitive running clubs for under tens to buying £ 2,000 racing bikes for children , over active fathers are increasingly competing through their offspring			0
from buying £ 2,000 racing bikes for children , over active dads could be fuelling a health and body image crisis in young kids			0
the trends were collated by @entity241 , a new online chat show for mothers			0
founder @entity244 , also founder of @entity245 said : ' raising kids can bring out the best – and the worst – in mums			2
while some of these trends may seem extreme , what was extreme ten years ago is now mainstream			0
' the web means wacky ideas catch on fast and there is more pressure than ever before for parents to be perfect			2
' mother @entity256 decided to bring up her son as gender neutral and spoke on @entity260 's @entity259 to explain why she made this unusual choice and of her experiences in raising @entity263 as neither boy or girl until he was five years old			1
explaining the concept of being gender nuetral , @entity256 says : ' it 's just not making assumptions about what your kids are going to do or enjoy based on whether they 're boys or girls ' i grew up with feminism so i grew up feeling equal rightswas still something we had to fight for @entity256 made the decision to raise her son as gender neutral for his first five years ' there are lots of things that girls like that i dont like to make it obvious to me that slotting me into a sterytype just because i 'm female is silly			1
' @entity256 's decision to raise her son without the influence of gender stereotypes was made before his birth , and began in the delievery room			1
' when he was born we asked the nurses not to say wheter @entity295 was a boy or a girl and actually it wasnt the first thing we looked for ' we just sat there holding the baby and didnt feel like we absolutely had to know urgently whether it was a boy or a girl			0
it didnt seem that important , ' she explains			0
@entity256 does admit that the reaction of others was oftne confused : ' the midwives did think we were strange			0
they kept trooping in and out saying ' we do need something to put on our foms , we have got to fill in our forms			0
' @entity256 goes on to explain that even when they sent out an email to friends and family to announce the birth , they simply stated they had had a ' baby ' and did not specify sex			2
despite his unusual start in life , @entity256 insists @entity295 , now eight - years - old , knows he is male			2
' he 's always know he was a boy			0
we did n't do it for very long , ' she explains			0
' we tried to give him lots of different toys			0
there were lots of dolls around and lots of cars around			0
at the moment he is only interested in lego			0
' the whole point was for him to find his own feet without people saying " oh boys cant do that			0
" ' see the full interview on the @entity259 website			0
