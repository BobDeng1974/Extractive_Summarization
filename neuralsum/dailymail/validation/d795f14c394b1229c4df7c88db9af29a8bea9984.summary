but when he took on the role in the movie , @entity12 , which premieres on wednesday night and tells of the struggles for gay men in the macho sporting arena , he decided to reveal his sexuality to the world in the form of a @entity20 video			1
' i was told only gay people played gay roles and straight people got all of the straight roles			1
' it 's like saying i ca n't play @entity45 because i 'm not a fish			2
' @entity25 tells the story of the threat and confusion felt by the local surf lifesaving champion when he has his title taken off him a by a new club member who happens to be gay			0
although @entity5 does n't play a gay character - the theme of the movie was something that he could deeply relate to as he felt ' very shady and secretive '			1
the defining moment when @entity5 decided he could no longer live a lie was when he was directly asked if he was gay in a radio interview just after filming finished up just a year ago			1
' i completely shut down and said something like " that 's personal " , ' he said			0
' then i decided i could n't keep living like that - i was lying to myself and not being who i am			2

' a lot of actors said they applauded my bravery but they could never do what i did which i think is a really sad way to live , ' he said			0

' i just wanted to say this is who i am and thought it was no big deal but i received mind - blowing beautiful responses and only a couple of negative ones but nothing too brutal			0
' @entity5 moved to @entity101 a year ago to try to break into @entity102 which has made him notice that @entity4 still has a lot to learn when it comes to accepting homosexuals as equals in society			2

' the @entity117 has got 50 states and i think 37 now has got same sex marriage while none of them do in @entity4 - i think it 's one of the last countries in the western world to be completely against it which i find very sad			0
