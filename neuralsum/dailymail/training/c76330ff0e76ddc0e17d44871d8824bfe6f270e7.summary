by @entity0 @entity1 will make @entity4 the world ’s highest - paid player , with the four - time @entity6 winner poised to earn more than £ 335,000 per week			1
that is the pledge of club president @entity8 just two days after the @entity11 star 's hat - trick defeated @entity12 and put @entity1 back in the title race			1
' we all want @entity4 to be the best - paid player in the world and that is what we are working on , ' said @entity8			2
' right now we are concentrating on the competitions we are in but it will happen soon			0
centre of attention : @entity4 trains with his @entity1 team - mates on tuesday afternoon top dog : @entity4 could become the highest - paid player in the world , ahead of @entity25 high spirits : @entity25 ( right ) and @entity27 ( left ) prepare for @entity12 's game against @entity29 superstars : @entity4 is poised to earn more than @entity25 ( right ) and world 's most expensive player @entity31 ' nobody here wants to sell @entity4			1
you can not sell @entity36			0
he arrived here when he was 13 and he is one of ours			0
' @entity1 made their first offer to @entity4 ’s father and agent , @entity41 , earlier this year			2
it is understood the offer , which included ending his entitlement to 100 per cent of his image rights , did not impress the player and led to a freezing of relations between club and record goalscorer			2
the situation reached crisis point in late 2013 when vice-president @entity53 said : ' i do n’t know why this " senor " needs another contract anyway because we improved his deal only six months ago			0
' @entity4 responded by saying @entity53 knew ' nothing about football ' and stories confirming that various clubs including several from the @entity63 had made , or would be willing to make , offers to buy @entity4 began to surface			0
but the landscape has changed at @entity65 in recent weeks with the departure of @entity67			0
magician : @entity4 scored a hat - trick against @entity12 to sink @entity1 's rivals in @entity71 blow : @entity25 ( right ) would become the second highest - paid player on the planet under control ? @entity8 is confident @entity4 will stay on at @entity1 on top of the world : @entity31 already took @entity25 's crown as the planet 's most expensive player new man @entity8 is under pressure to deliver what the supporters want in his first six months in charge and top of that list is tying down @entity4 , who is currently signed until 2018			1
the deal , expected to be discussed when @entity88 sits down with @entity8 before the april 16 @entity90 final , will add another year to the player ’s commitment taking him to 2019 and will take him beyond @entity25 ’s estimated € 21million ( £ 17.5m ) net deal , which works out around £ 336,000 a week			1
what remains to be seen is if @entity1 are able to put @entity4 on a higher wage than @entity25 while still allowing him 100 per cent of his image rights – a privilege @entity25 does not enjoy at @entity12			1
although the figure @entity25 earns is € 1m above @entity4 , @entity12 take around 50 per cent of his image rights			1
history boy : @entity4 became the first ever @entity1 player to score a hat - trick at the @entity102 on sunday night poster boy : but @entity12 retain around 50 per cent of @entity25 's image rights @entity4 ’s badge kissing at the @entity102 as he became the first @entity1 player ever to score a hat - trick in @entity12 ’s stadium has increased the desire to ensure the superstar stays			1
all this will further frustrate the clubs who would move if they believed @entity4 was not planning to stay at the @entity114 – their only glimmer of hope is that the player is understood to be resisting any moves to increase his buy - out clause currently set at € 250m ( £ 208m )			1
not everyone in @entity1 believes @entity4 should be given a pay - rise			0
the editor of @entity1 paper @entity123 has said the player should be more grateful to the club			0
speaking in a radio debate before the @entity71 he said : ' if it was not for the club , @entity4 would measure 1.40 meters and would n’t even reach to hold - on on the metro or the bus			2
' he would have fallen on the floor so a bit of gratitude please			0
' the comment , which was a reference to the growth hormone injections @entity1 paid for @entity4 to have when he arrived at the club aged 13 , have infuriated @entity1 supporters .			0

@entity139 *giants* set to offer @entity4 *bumper* deal before @entity141
relations froze between player and club after comments from vice-president
@entity4 likely to earn more than @entity12 rival @entity25
@entity11 star poised to *pocket* more than £ 335,000 per week
