@entity0 has laid down the law to his @entity3 players ahead of the new season			1
the strict coach has implemented a fines list which will see players punished for things from turning up late to training to arriving home after midnight			1
many rules similar to these were in place during @entity14 's era at @entity3 but were slackened after he left			1
players have to be home by midnight in the two days before a game declarations from the players must always be respectful players must be responsible when using social media like @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 players must wear official club clothes on club business players are prohibited from taking part in dangerous activities , like alpine sports , using motorbikes and diving severe acts of misconduct could result in players being expelled from the club @entity58 was renowned for being lax and @entity0 hopes his disciplinary scheme will sharpen up a squad of stars who under - performed last season			1
the players have already reacted well to the new coach 's arrival , working hard in training to impress @entity0			1
now they can impress him in another way - not breaking any of the rules which he has imposed			2
as reported by @entity70 , players will be fined between € 1,000 and € 6,000 if they break @entity0 's laws			1
fines at the top end of the scale are considered very serious breaches of discipline and will then be further punished by at club executive level			0
a severe act of misconduct could see a player expelled from the club			0
it is not known if biting another player falls into this category , but with @entity86 suspended for four months for doing just that , it would be in his interest to find out			0
@entity90 swap : @entity91 ( left ) has been handed the no 5 jersey after @entity94 's retirement dynamic duo : @entity0 will be hoping @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) can rekindle their best next season @entity0 has demanded that players arrive at the @entity101 for training an hour earlier than activities are scheduled to begin			2
a sign - in register has already been created at @entity3 's training complex			2
while the penalty for lateness will be on the low end of the scale , missing a session without good reason will be heavily punished			0
alcohol is completely prohibited during meal - times , with players drinking water or carbonated beverages			1
@entity14 occasionally used to permit drinks with a low alcoholic content to be consumed , but @entity0 is taking a hard - line stance on this issue			1
@entity0 has also told the players that they must be home before midnight the two days before a game			2
snow go : @entity0 has told his players that they are not allowed to go skiing certainly not : @entity0 has also banned his @entity126 squad from riding motorcycles in case of injury naughty : £ 75million signing @entity86 ( right ) is banned for four months after biting @entity131 ( right ) @entity14 used to conduct checks by calling on a player he suspected was contravening his rules but it is not clear if @entity0 will do the same			1
given the @entity139 's low tolerance threshold for misbehaviour , it seems likely			0
players have also been informed that they must wear official gear on club trips or events			0
this could see an end to the likes of @entity148 and @entity149 wearing their own branded clothes before and after games			0
the squad have also been told that when they speak , at events or press conferences , they must always be respectful			0
getting stuck in : @entity155 ( right ) battles @entity96 ( left ) for the ball during friday 's pre-season session no laughing matter : despite the sanctions imposed by @entity0 , @entity159 manages to raise a smile in the doghouse : @entity163 was forced to apologise for leaking the sale of @entity165 to @entity166 @entity0 would not have been impressed with @entity163 , for example , when he gave away that @entity165 was leaving @entity3			1
the centre - back actually apologised for this on thursday , admitting that discussing it in public with @entity173 manager @entity172 was a mistake			0
this applies to social media too - they have been reminded of their responsibilities			0
@entity0 is happy for the players to use @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , but if he decides during the season that they are giving the club a negative image he could clamp down upon it			2
they are not permitted to undertake dangerous sports or activities , like riding motorbikes , mountain climbing and even diving			0
out to impress : summer signing @entity192 ( right ) will be looking to win a first - team place at the @entity194 @entity0 has decreed that fines accrued during the season will be given to charity			1
@entity70 claim the first fine has already been paid , with @entity163 receiving the dubious debut honour , while @entity3 train at @entity201			1
it was the lightest possible sanction , for being late by a few minutes			0
the defender was regularly in hot water under @entity14 's disciplinary scheme and it seems like not much has changed in that regard			2
one area which has not been revealed yet is @entity0 's demands over the players diets			2
while @entity14 kept @entity211 away from red meat , @entity58 allowed the @entity213 to enjoy it , with some claiming that it detracted from his performances .			0

new boss @entity0 has imposed strict rules and fines on his @entity3 squad
fines vary from € 1,000 to € 6,000 and will be given to charity if rules broken
alcohol prohibited at meal times
skiing and motorcycling are also banned and there *'ll* be fines for lateness
however there is no fine for biting
rules are a slight modification to those under @entity14
