by @entity1 reporter no one likes to be sick or be near someone who is threatening to throw up			1
but for a staggering three million @entity5 , vomit is so terrifying it causes intense panic and even obsessive behaviour , which in extreme cases leads to starvation and agoraphobia			1
one person who to have suffered with emetophobia until just a few years ago is @entity13 , 37 from @entity14			1
@entity13 started to fear being sick when she was eighty ears old and believes the phobia was triggered by whooping cough			1
she would sometimes wear a scarf around her face to avoid coming into contact with germs ' at 8 years old i developed an ever growing fear of sickness , and my parents think it could be linked to a serious bout of whooping cough i suffered , ' said the leader of an international telecoms company			1
' since then emetophobia has been a debilitating presence in my everyday life			0
i developed obsessive cleaning and sanitation habits as i as terrified of getting anything like @entity35			0
@entity13 explained that if her son was poorly as a baby she would avoid eating two to three days after coming into in contact with him to make sure she did n't vomit			1
@entity13 would panic about her son getting ill because she feared it would make her vomit			1
she also developed compulsive habits such as finger crossing to stop herself getting sick ' i ’d wear a scarf over my face in ' risky ' situations , and i also developed mild compulsive habits such as finger crossing , praying to stop myself getting sick			1
' i also spent far too many hours researching @entity35 on internet			0
' when my son started school , i would obsessively aski around the school to see if any viruses were going around that might put my child at risk and subsequently me at risk			1
@entity13 has since made a full recovery from her debilitating phobia thanks to a therapy called thrive it was only when @entity13 started to look for help that she realised she suffered with emetophobia and that her condition had a name			1
@entity13 tried many different ways to treat her fear but nothing seemed to help			1
' my doctor did n’t really understand what was happening to me , so she packed me off with some contacts for therapists and some leaflets about self - help , but these did n’t address the phobia itself and so i knew it was n’t going to work			1
' @entity13 tried therapy such as over-the - phone @entity81 , an @entity84 programme , following on from diagnosis of depression			1
' the doctor summarised that my problem all stemmed from depression , but i knew that i was n’t depressed			0
' when i voiced my thoughts i was told , “ well , it must stem from anxiety then , so someone will be on hand in next week to talk to you about anxiety ”			0
' i was so frustrated that no one was listening to me			0
' @entity98 , a fear of vomiting or seeing others being sick , is thought to affect three million people in the @entity5			1
the condition is not widely diagnosed , even though it is a fairly common anxiety disorder			1
it is thought to affect more women than men			2
@entity98 varies enormously in how it effects a sufferers - most worry excessively about being sick even though they are less likely than the general population to be ill because of all the steps they take to avoid being infected			1
some sufferers may be unable to leave home if there are any tummy bugs going around and they will avoid family and friends who have an illness			2
they may also fear the feeling of being out of control while they are being sick or fear being sick in public which can trigger avoidance behaviours			2
this can present problems for mothers who can experience extreme panic if their child is ill and will feel terrified if they are actually sick			1
for emetophobes the mere sight of someone else being ill is enough to trigger obsessive behaviours			2
for many sufferers , vomitting makes them feel out of control many sufferers will also have a strict diet which is free from anything that might cause a stomach upset and some will avoid medications which list nausea as a side - effect			2
many women will also dread the thought of being pregnant because of concerns about coping with ‘ morning - sickness ’			2
treatment usually involves various forms of therapy - sometimes exposure therapy - as well as antidepressants			2
another former sufferer is @entity156 , 35 , from @entity157 , who traces her phobia back to having severe whooping cough as a little girl			1
' the first time i realised it was an issue was when i was four or five			0
' my older brother threw up in car on way home from a gymnastics display and i was so revolted and terrified by it , that i grabbed the door handle and threw myself out of the back of the car in the middle of a busy road			1
' @entity156 sometimes found her phobia so intense that she did n't think life was worth living throughout her childhood she avoided other children to prevent being sick			1
she also avoided food to the extent where she was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder			2
' at 14 i was dramatically underweight , to the point that i was given only two weeks to live			0
' doctors diagnosed me inaccurately with anorexia nervosa , but i never had body issues			0
' i could see that i was far too thin , i just did n’t want to eat			0
@entity184 was an inconvenience and a problem to me but it was hard to convince professionals that this was n’t related to body image			0
' eventually she was put into on a re-feeding programme , where she was force - fed. @entity192 went on to have exposure therapy where vomitting was induced by drinking a syrup which made her phobia worse			1
' i became a recluse			0
i could n’t eat , sleep or function on any level because of vomit			0
' my life sometimes did n’t feel like it was worth living			0
' i successfully avoided vomit for three decades but it came at a very high price			2
' every minute of the day was consumed with risk assessment , decisions based only on one factor – risk of vomit			0
' everything i did had this purpose – the food i ate , the clothes i wore , how i cleaned my house , where i went , who i saw			0
' but both women have managed to overcome their disorder thanks to a new therapy called @entity220 , which is similar to @entity221 , a type of talking treatment			1
doctors was inaccurately diagnosed @entity156 with anorexia			0
she said : ' i could see that i was far too thin , i just did n't want to eat			0
food was an inconvenience [ because of my phobia ]			2
' devised by former hypnotherapist @entity230 , the treatment aims to help smokers , people who struggle with their weight , those who live in intense pain as well as sufferers of various phobias			1
it is a six - part training programme that can be done at home with a book or at seminars or bootcamp			0
it works by helping a person to better understand how they react to situations as well as change any unhealthy behaviours			0
@entity156 has now made a full recovery after undergoing the thrive therapy programme ‘ the main gist of @entity249 is that it is not a type of therapy where something that is ' done to ' a person , ’ said @entity230			1
' it is about empowering people to [ make changes ] for themselves			2
' it ’s cheaper than traditional therapy , does n't require raking up past experiences , and the person does n't become reliant upon the consultant			2
the nearest thing would be @entity221			1
’ @entity13 said : ' my thrive therapist told me thrive was a cure , not something that might help and that it would definitely work if i did everything she said in the sessions and stuck with it			1
' one of fundamental giveaways , she said , is not the removal of negative thoughts but the way to process these negative thoughts into positive ones			0
' a few days after my third session my little boy said he felt sick , which usually would have struck fear in me and had me running out of the house and calling a friend to come and look after him , but instead i comforted him and did n’t even think about the danger of him vomiting			2
' i did n’t even think about it but i only realised this after the time			0
i ’m not sure how it happened , but without realising it , i had been completely cured			0
' @entity192 added : ' what was different about @entity290 was that i taught myself to do it			0
the entire point is that nobody can change you except you			0
you have to see the change you want to be and fix your internal thinking to fix your external behaviour			0

it is thought that 3 million people suffer with the condition in the @entity5
phobia not fully understood but thought to be linked to childhood trauma
@entity13 , 37 , obsessively researched *norovirus* and avoided ill son
@entity309 , 35 , starved herself and threw herself out of car to avoid sick
but both are now ' cured ' after undergoing a new therapy called thrive
similar to @entity221 , it aims to help people cope with *uncomfortable* *emotions* rather than *suppress* them
