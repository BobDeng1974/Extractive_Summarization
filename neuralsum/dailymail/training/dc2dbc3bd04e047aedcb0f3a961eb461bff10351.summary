by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 04:28 est , 4 december 2012 an ' extremely rare ' @entity2 helmet that was later used as a vessel to hold human remains following a cremation has been discovered			1
the @entity6 revealed the helmet , that resembles those worn by @entity10 troops in the @entity11 , was unearthed by a metal - detectorist near @entity13 , @entity14 , last month			1
a brooch found with the helmet is thought to have once fastened a bag containing human bones			2
the person who owned the helmet , possibly a @entity22 mercenary , may have fought against the @entity23 in @entity24 ( now @entity25 ) or alongside them , eventually bringing the object to @entity22			0
spoil of war ? the rare @entity2 helmet found near @entity13 , @entity14			1
experts say it may have belonged to a mercenary who fought in @entity25 and eventually brought it back to this country the @entity6 's curator of @entity2 objects @entity37 said : ' this is a very rare find			1
' no other cremation has ever been found in @entity14 accompanied by a helmet and only a handful of @entity2 helmets are known from @entity22			1
' therefore we think this example was probably made on the continent and it is fascinating to speculate how it came to be in a grave in @entity14			2
' the museum also revealed metal - detectorists have also found a boar mount , which could have belonged to @entity52 , and a @entity54 hoard			1
the copper - alloy mount , which shows a boar , chained , collared and wearing a crown , with a crescent above one of its legs was found on the @entity62 foreshore , near the @entity63			1
the news comes as tests take place on a skeleton that was found in september underneath a @entity69 car park , to discover whether it was @entity52 the boar mount associated with @entity52 found on the @entity62 foreshore : experts believe it might have decorated an item of leather once owned by his supporters , or possibly even the king himself the second largest hoard of @entity83 gold coins ever found in @entity22 : the finds were announced today at the launch of the portable antiquities and @entity88 annual reports at the @entity6 he took the white boar as his emblem , while badges in the form of the animal were ordered for the king 's cremation in 1485			1
it is not know where the mount , found in october , came from but experts believe it might have decorated an item of leather once owned by his supporters , or possibly even the king himself			1
' given the renewed interest in @entity52 , after the apparent discovery of his remains in @entity110 , it is wonderful to have a @entity112 find associated with the king , ' said @entity113 , deputy head of the @entity6 's department of @entity115 archaeologists in september announced they had unearthed what appear to be the remains of @entity52 , which have been lost for 527 years			1
using historic maps , they traced a friary where he was rumoured to have been buried after being killed in battle – underneath a social services department car park in @entity69			0
and after only three weeks of digging , they found the skeleton of an adult male who was well - built and clearly of noble descent			2
his injuries – a metal arrowhead embedded in his back , and a severe blow to the head – are consistent with reports of his death at the @entity137 in 1485			0
even more persuasive is the fact that the man has a severely curved spine ; @entity52 was famously nicknamed @entity141			2
@entity52 , the last of the @entity143 kings , ruled for only two years before dying in battle aged 32			2
it marked the end of the @entity147 and the victory of @entity149 , the first of the new dynasty			0
experts stressed that the remains must be subjected to rigorous dna testing , currently underway , to be sure if it is him			0
but lead archaeologist @entity157 said : ' i 'd be very surprised if someone else was buried at this same spot with critical injuries			0
' ' the mount is very similar to a number of boar badges which have been reported @entity88 over the past few years , which were made for followers of @entity52 ( of @entity166 ) , as @entity167 , during the @entity147			1
' @entity52 took the white boar as his sign			2
' bore ' may have also been an anagram of @entity172 , the @entity173 for @entity166			0
' a hoard of @entity177 gold and silver metalwork were also discovered in may , on farmland near @entity179 , north @entity180			0
the hoard consists of an iron sword pommel inlaid with gold foil plaques , four gold hoops from the hilt of the sword , six small gold rivets , four silver collars and neck - rings , a silver arm - ring , a silver ring fragment , a silver brooch , and 29 silver ingots			0
the hoard , thought to be @entity54 bullion , obtained in trade or plundered from enemies , was discovered by metal detectorists @entity199 and @entity200 , who work in the animal feed business			0
whoever buried the material would have intended to come back for it , to exchange or melt it down and reuse for jewellery			0
at the time when the hoard was deposited the north of @entity208 was largely under @entity54 rule and some of the objects are decorated in late @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity54 art styles			0
the finds were announced today at the launch of the portable antiquities and @entity88 annual reports at the @entity6			1
it was announced earlier this year that a metal - detectorist near @entity224 , @entity222 had discovered the second - largest hoard of @entity83 gold ever found in @entity22			1
some 97,509 finds were recorded by the @entity228 in 2011 , an 8 per cent rise on the previous year			0
under the @entity231 , finders have a legal obligation to report all finds of potential treasure to the local coroner .			0
