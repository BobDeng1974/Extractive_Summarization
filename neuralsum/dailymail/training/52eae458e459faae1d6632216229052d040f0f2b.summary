by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:49 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 2 october 2013 four months ago , @entity2 , 15 , decided to have her leg amputated and she can now march with her fellow @entity4 a teenage @entity5 has marched for the first time – after asking surgeons to amputate her left leg			1
@entity2 , 15 , was born with club foot , she only had a third of the calf muscle she should have had in her left leg , and she had severe arthritis in her ankle joints			1
she also had foot drop – the inability to lift the foot and toes properly when walking			1
as a result , she experienced years of treatments and pain			0
so , four months ago , the schoolgirl took the decision to have her leg amputated			1
just a week after undergoing major surgery @entity2 was back at school sitting a @entity24 that she passed with an a grade			1
before the surgery she broke toes on her left foot about six times because of her foot drop			1
she said : ‘ the operation was the best thing in the world for me			0
‘ i was in a wheelchair for a year before the operation			2
it really got me down that i could n’t march alongside my peers , i hated being in the wheelchair , unfortunately the pain stopped me from being able to do it			1
‘ now , 12 months on , i can stand on parade and will be doing full marches with the @entity4 in the coming months			1
‘ to stand alongside them and bang the drum was the best feeling in the world			0
it may have rained on the parade , but nothing can take away the sense of joy i have at being able to stand tall without the pain			0
‘ i was in constant pain before and in last year ’s march i was in a wheelchair in agony with my foot and ankle hurting so much			1
‘ there is not a hint of regret about the decision			0
i had no doubts that what i was doing was the right thing			0
’ @entity2 , from @entity64 , added : ‘ before the operation my consultant asked : “ what will you do if the man who loves you says something about your limb ? ” but i replied that does n’t matter , he ’ll love me for who i am			2
’ @entity2 explained that before the operation her left leg was a lot shorter than her right one			1
@entity2 was born with club foot			2
she only had a third of the normal amount of calf muscle in her leg and had severe arthritis in her ankle			1
she also struggled to lift her foot up when walking so kept breaking her toes before her operation , @entity2 ( pictured at a parade a year ago ) was in a wheelchair and suffered agonising pain in her leg			1
her mobility was also decreasing rapidly just a week after undergoing major surgery @entity2 was back at school sitting a @entity24 that she passed with an a grade doctors used a frame to try and stretch it but this failed to help her walk as the nerves in her foot did not work properly meaning she could not lift it up and routinely broke her toes			1
her mother , @entity102 , 47 , said : ‘ @entity2 got an a in the exam just a week after the operation and we are all in awe of her , she is inspirational			2
‘ when she had her operation , she simply said it was the best thing in the world , there was not a hint of regret			0
when @entity2 was a child ( pictured ) she had numerous procedures to help treat her club foot but she remained in pain and still struggled to walk @entity2 said : ' the operation was the best thing in the world for me			1
i was in a wheelchair for a year before the operation			0
it really got me down that i could n't march alongside my peers , i hated being in the wheelchair ' ‘ we had discussed it two years before and the consultants wanted second opinions to make sure , but @entity2 started deteriorating quite rapidly - her movement became more and more limited			1
‘ when she was walking in the house she would be breaking her toes , she did it six or seven times as if she did n’t pick her knee up high enough , her toes would drag behind and break if she knocked them on the stairs or the floor			2
’ her father @entity139 , 48 , who manufactures paint in the family firm , added : ‘ we ’re absolutely delighted for @entity2 - at last she has a pain free existence			2
’ @entity2 said : ' there is not a hint of regret about the decision			0
i had no doubts that what i was doing was the right thing ' the doctors are amazed at the amount of activity @entity2 has already undertaken and say she ’s months ahead of a normal recovery			1
@entity2 is now trying to raise money for two new prosthetic limbs not available on the @entity158 - one for social purposes and another for cycling			2
to donate , visit @entity161 / club foot is a deformity of the foot and ankle that is present from birth			0
it causes the foot to point down and inwards with the soles of the feet facing backwards			0
it affects one baby in every 1,000 in the @entity173 and the cause is unknown			0
boys are twice as likely to be affected as girls and about half of the children born with club foot have both feet affected			0
the first treatment involves using a cast to gently manipulate the foot into a better position			0
most babies then need surgery to allow the foot a more normal range of movement			2
the child will then need special boots attached to a bar to hold the foot in place			0
in about 95 per cent of patients , this treatment is successful			0

@entity2 only had a third of the normal amount of calf muscle in her left leg and she had severe arthritis in her ankle joint
she also had foot drop which meant she could n't lift her foot properly
this caused her to *frequently* break her toes when she was walking
for a year before surgery she had to use a wheelchair and was in pain
she decided to have the leg amputated four months ago and can now march with her fellow @entity4 using a prosthetic leg
