scientists have created an entire simulation of the universe in order to understand the formation of galaxies , stars and more			1
the man - made cosmos is a computer simulation in which galaxies similar to those observed by astronomers grow and evolve			2
two of the world 's most powerful supercomputers - the ' @entity15 ' at the @entity16 and ' @entity17 ' in @entity18 - were used to conduct the simulations , which took several months in total to run			1
here , gas in the @entity27 shows hot bubbles ( red colours ) surrounding large galaxies , connected by colder filaments ( blue and green colours )			2
the insets show the distribution of gas , stars and dark matter previous attempts to model the formation of galaxies have met with little success , producing collections of stars that were often too massive , small , old or spherical			1
those produced in the @entity47 of @entity48 and their environments ) simulation are much more realistic			0
one key to its success is the recreation of galactic winds - cosmic gas gales driven by stars , supernova explosions and supermassive black holes - which are stronger than those in earlier simulations , say the scientists			0
galactic winds affect the development of galaxies by blowing away the gas from which stars form			2
the sizes and shapes of the thousands of galaxies produced in the @entity27 simulation closely match their ' real ' counterparts , and can be used to study the history of the universe almost as far back as the @entity74 13.8 billion years ago			1
professor @entity75 , from the @entity16 , said : ' the universe generated by the computer is just like the real thing			2
there are galaxies everywhere , with all the shapes , sizes and colours i 've seen with the world 's largest telescopes			1
in the @entity27 universe i can even press a button to make time run backwards			1
' results from the research will appear in the journal @entity93 tomorrow			0
co-author dr @entity94 , from @entity96 @entity95 , said : ' this is the start of a new era for us			0
we can now manipulate the conditions of the universe and study the evolution of galaxies throughout the past 14 billion years			2
' dark matter accounts for around 85 per cent of the universe			1
it surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			0
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
a dark matter halo is the hypothetical region that surrounds a galaxy			2
it is thought to extend well beyond the visible edge of the galaxy and dominates the total mass of the galaxy			0
however , since they can not be observed directly their existence is only a theory			0
nonetheless its believed that many galaxies were born in such halos - but why there are only a few in our vicinity is a mystery			0
according to @entity16 's simulation the explanation could be that only those halos that grew fast enough after the @entity74 were able to eventually form galaxies			1
@entity27 simulation may also help in the hunt for one of the universe 's most elusive phenomena - dark matter			1
physicists say the simulations show that ' halos ' of matter that formed as the universe developed could be evidence of the elusive substance			0
scientists believe that these clumps of dark matter , or halos , that emerged from the early universe trapped intergalactic gas and became the birthplaces of galaxies			1
cosmological theory predicts that our own cosmic neighbourhood should be teeming with millions of small halos containing galaxies , but only a few dozen such small galaxies have been observed around the @entity169			0
' i 've been losing sleep over this for the last 30 years , ' said professor @entity173 , director of @entity16 's @entity174			2
' dark matter is the key to everything we know about galaxies , but we still do n't know its exact nature			1
' understanding how galaxies formed holds the key to the dark matter mystery			1
' one of the biggest mysteries is why there is n't a galaxy in every halo			0
the researchers believe their simulations answer this question , showing explicitly how and why millions of halos around our galaxy and neighbouring @entity194 failed to produce galaxies and became barren			0
they say the gas that would have made the galaxy was sterilised by the heat from the first stars that formed in the universe , and was prevented from cooling and turning into stars			2
however , a few halos managed to bypass this cosmic furnace by growing early and fast enough to hold on to their gas and eventually form galaxies			0
in this animation , a flight through 13 billion years of cosmic history takes us to ' our ' @entity210 in the @entity27 simulation			1
the change in colours indicates how stars heat up the intergalactic gas to high temperatures ( credit : @entity75 , @entity16 ) the simulation is hoped to solve the mystery as to why there is n't a galaxy in every dark matter halo			1
here the visible galaxies in the @entity210 simulation , shown in the lower right , only trace a tiny fraction of the vast number of dark matter halos , revealed in the upper left the findings , first presented at the @entity232 's @entity231 in @entity233 earlier this year , were funded by the @entity235 's @entity234 ( @entity234 ) and the @entity236			1
a recent @entity238 - led researchers said they may have found the first hints of dark matter particles			1
using two observatories they found an unidentified spike of x-ray intensity in a galaxy cluster 240 million light - years away			0
the signal could be the sign of the decay of ' sterile neutrinos ' , one of the proposed particles that dark matter is made of			1
however , the researchers claim the dark matter explanation is a ' long shot '			1
' we have learned that most dark matter halos are quite different from the ' chosen few ' that are lit up by starlight , ' professor @entity173 continued , referring to some that contain stars and some that do not			1
' thanks to our simulations we know that if our theories of dark matter are correct then the universe around us should be full of halos that failed to make a galaxy			1
' perhaps astronomers will one day figure out a way to find them			0
' lead researcher dr @entity274 , in the @entity174 , at @entity16 , said the research was the first to simulate the evolution of our ' @entity210 ' of galaxies			2
this is a group of more than 54 galaxies that includes @entity194 and the @entity169			0
' what we 've seen in our simulations is a cosmic own goal , ' said dr @entity274			0
' we already knew that the first generation of stars emitted intense radiation , heating intergalactic gas to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. ' after that , the gas is so hot that further star formation gets a lot more difficult , leaving halos with little chance to form galaxies			2
' we were able to show that the cosmic heating was not simply a lottery with a few lucky winners			0
' instead , it was a rigorous selection process and only halos that grew fast enough were fit for galaxy formation			0
' the findings by the researchers were funded by the @entity235 's @entity234 ( @entity234 ) and the @entity236			2
the team used the @entity309 , pictured , to create the simulation			0
it has 6720 @entity312 and 53,760 gigabytes of ram the close - up look at the @entity210 is part of the larger @entity27 project currently undertaken by cosmologists at @entity16 and the @entity318 in the @entity319			1
@entity27 is one of the first attempts to simulate what happened from the @entity74 to the present day in the formation of galaxies in the universe			2
by peering into the virtual universe , the researchers find galaxies that look remarkably like our own , surrounded by countless dark matter halos , only a small fraction of which contain galaxies			1
the @entity335 - led simulation was carried out on the ' @entity15 ' , which is the part of the @entity309 national supercomputing facility for research in astrophysics and particle physics funded by the @entity341 through the @entity234			0
the @entity15 - based at @entity16 - has more than 5,000 times the computing power of typical pcs , and over 10,000 times the amount of memory .			0

researchers at @entity16 in the @entity235 and @entity318 in the @entity319 have made an entire simulation of the universe
they used two of the world 's most powerful supercomputers to make it
called the @entity27 simulation it charts the formation of stars and galaxies
it allows researchers to go *forwards* and backwards in time and space
and it could even be used to solve mysteries such as dark matter
