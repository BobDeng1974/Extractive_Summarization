by @entity0 found : a letter written by @entity2 , the first @entity3 spy to be captured during the @entity4 , to his guards at the @entity6 has been found after 100 years a letter written by the first @entity3 spy to be captured during the @entity4 to the guards at the @entity6 has been found after 100 years			1
@entity2 was shot by firing squad at the @entity6 in november 1914 , after he was found guilty of war treason and sentenced to death			1
now , nearly 100 years after the 37 - year - old was killed , a letter he wrote to the guards at the @entity6 , thanking them for the ' courtesy and consideration ' shown towards him , has been unearthed			1
in the letter to the guard 's commanding officer , the @entity3 lieutenant wrote : ' i feel it is my duty as a @entity3 officer to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the guards and sentries			1
' asking for his thanks to be passed on to the men , he added : ' although they never neglected their duty , they have shown always the utmost courtesy and consideration towards me			0
' the letter was written the day before @entity2 's execution on november 6 , 1914			1
it has been stored at the @entity42 at @entity43 , but has now been uncovered as part of an exhibition at the museum on the @entity4 , and the role of the @entity48 during the conflict			2
born in @entity50 on january 20 , 1877 , @entity2 joined the @entity51 in 1900 - serving for a year before he was transferred into the @entity52 and then went on to enterthe merchant navy , where he served on @entity54 , @entity56 and @entity57 ships			2
in 1904 he graduated as a captain from the @entity59 in @entity60 , but became ill and was never able to take up the post			0
instead he changed career and became a tourist guide - making many friends from the @entity57 as a result of his new role			0
in 1912 , @entity2 married an @entity57 woman , and although the marriage did not last he managed to obtain a forged @entity57 passport under the name @entity71 - enabling @entity2 , who spoke @entity54 with an @entity57 accent , to travel throughout @entity73			2
as war loomed , @entity2 volunteered as a @entity75 , and offered to travel to @entity76 in order to observe and report back on the country 's fleet			1
gratitude : nearly 100 years after the 37 - year - old was killed , a letter he wrote to the guards at the @entity6 , thanking them for the ' courtesy and consideration ' shown towards him has been unearthed his request was denied , and in 1914 he requested to be released from the @entity52 so he could go back to @entity57			1
at the outbreak of war , @entity3 naval intelligence decided that @entity2 's command of @entity54 and @entity57 passport would make him and ideal agent			1
he was persuaded to travel to @entity54 to gather information on the actual losses suffered by the @entity76 fleet , @entity76 's air defences and the activities at @entity99 naval base in @entity100 , @entity101			1
' i feel it is my duty as a @entity3 officer to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the guards and sentries ' @entity2 , november 1914 however , @entity2 's intelligence gathering training was limited , and his attempts at espionage were somewhat inaccurate and amateurish			1
@entity2 , who stayed at a hotel in @entity100 , sent his first coded report back by telegram transmitted via @entity116			2
it read : ' must cancel			0
@entity118 very ill. lost four days , shall leave shortly , @entity71			0
' this meant that there were four ships being repaired at the dock , and that several others were about to head out to sea			0
the @entity3 dispatched the @entity126 submarine to this area with orders to attack the shipping about to leave			2
the lead ship was @entity131 , a class scout crusier , which became the first ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired from a submarine			0
but after this @entity2 's lack of training started to show , and he began to make mistakes - putting his address on his letters and writing them in @entity3 , while he also stopped encrypting the contents			1
his actions soon alerted the authorities , and although he fled to @entity146 in @entity147 he was arrested by police as a suspected spy			0
execution : @entity2 was shot by firing squad at the @entity6 in november 1914 , after he was found guilty of war treason and sentenced to death he was taken to @entity154 and detained at @entity43 , before being convicted of espionage following a court martial at the @entity157 in @entity158 , and sentenced to death			1
he had denied attempting to convey information calculated to be useful to an enemy through a letter sent from @entity101 , and committing war treason by sending a letter to @entity50 from @entity165			1
during the second day of his trial he admitted that he was a @entity3 national and that the @entity57 passport found in his possession was a fake			2
when the @entity170 went to @entity2 â€™s cell to collect him for execution , he is alledged to have said : ' i suppose that you will not care to shake hands with a @entity3 spy ? ' the provost marshal responded : ' no. but i will shake hands with a brave man			1
' he was executed on a miniature rifle range at the @entity6 by an eight man firing squad made up of members of the @entity185 , @entity186			1
his execution was meant to be a secret , but it was rumoured that members of the firing squad broke up the chair @entity2 was sitting on when executed and sold it in the local pubs			1
artifacts : the bullet that killed @entity2 during his execution by firing squad on november 6 , 1914 @entity196 : a sixpence which @entity2 gave to a guard looking after him as a tip @entity200 , a @entity201 at the time of @entity2 's death said of his execution : ' the escort and the firing party , too , where far from comfortable , and one could see that the slow march suitable to the occasion was getting badly on their nerves			1
they wanted to hurry over it , and get the beastly business finished			0
' but the prisoner walked steadly , upright , and yet as easily and unconcerned as though he was going to a tea - party , instead of to his death			0
his eyes were upturned to the gloomy skies , and his nostrils eagerly drank in the precious air that was soon to be denied them			0
but his face was quite calm and composed - almost expressionless			0
' then came a queer and pathetic little incident			0
as the party came to the end of the @entity225 , the @entity226 , in his nervousness made to turn left , which was the wrong way			0
instantly @entity2 took a quick step forward , caught the chaplain by the right arm and with a polite and kindly smile , gently guided him to the right - the correct way			2
' a few minutres later the procession disappeared through the doorway to the sinister shed , and shortly after there came the muffled sound of a single volley			0
@entity2 had paid ! ' when i think of @entity2 a phrase always slips into my head - just three little words : a gentleman unafraid ! ' @entity2 was first buried in the @entity6 and later disinterred and transferred to the @entity246 in @entity247 then finally to @entity248 , north @entity154			1
@entity249 / the @entity6 's @entity250 despite its bloody reputation , few executions actually took place inside the @entity6 , with many prisoners executed publicly at other sites in @entity154 , including nearby @entity256			2
private executions were reserved for only the most sensitive and high profile cases , such as the palace 's most famous execution - the beheading of @entity262 , king @entity264 's second wife , who was convicted of infedility and incest and beheaded by a @entity268 swordsman near @entity269 in may 1536			0
in total six people were executed at the @entity6 during the @entity271 period - @entity273 @entity272 , @entity264 's fifth wife @entity274 and her lady - in - waiting lady @entity276 , @entity277 - who was named @entity275 following the death of @entity279 , and @entity280 , the @entity281 , who became the last person to be officially beheaded at the @entity6 in 1601 , under queen elizabeth 1			2
all six are buried inside the @entity284 , within the @entity6			0
on july 18 , 1743 three men from the @entity287 regiment were shot at the @entity6 on charges of mutiny			2
the @entity291 regiment had been charged with keeping peace in @entity101 , and were assured they were only be asked to serve there			0
however , as they travelled to @entity154 to be inspected by the @entity264 they heard rumours that they were to be instead deployed to the @entity298 - leading around 100 men to turn back			0
they were taken to the @entity6 and all but three were pardoned			0
in total 11 men of various nationalities were shot as spies by firing squad at the @entity6 between 1914 and 1918			1
during the @entity304 again served as a temporary prison and in august 1941 @entity3 @entity306 was the last person to be executed there			0
he had been caught as he parachuted into @entity54 and found guilty of espionage , before being shot by firing squad while seated in a chair in the @entity310 .			1
