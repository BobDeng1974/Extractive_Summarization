as a child growing up in @entity2 , @entity0 dreamed of joining the military and hoped one day to become a paratrooper and @entity6 soldier			1
but earlier this year the 44 - year - old was arrested at @entity8 on his way home from @entity11 after trying and failing to join @entity13 terrorists fighting in @entity14			1
according to @entity16 officials , @entity0 spent eight months in the @entity17 where he tried to sell military - grade guns and ammunition online			1
in an @entity21 interview , he openly admitted he wanted to join @entity13 and said he would fight any enemies of @entity23 - be it the @entity14 's @entity25 or president @entity26			1
he wrote : ' @entity42 pledging allegiance to @entity44 and @entity45 commanding good and forbidding evil			0
' @entity13 , which is now known as @entity45 , controls a large area of @entity41 and has gained a reputation for appalling brutality after videos appeared of fighters performing mass executions and crucifixions			2
it is now responsible for the beheading of two @entity16 journalists			0
the first , @entity57 was killed last month , while the second , @entity59 , was executed on tuesday			0
so how did @entity0 go from being a @entity28 child with dreams of serving his country , to a radical @entity63 hoping to help destroy it ? @entity0 travelled to @entity11 earlier this year to be with his second wife , and while there he tweeted about his loyalty to @entity13 and tried to join the group in @entity14			1
he was arrested coming back to the @entity16 in july according to an interview with @entity21 , @entity0 's journey began after he took part in a bootcamp which would have seen him deployed with the @entity72 in @entity73 during @entity74			1
he failed to pass the grade , and with his childhood dream in tatters he turned instead to a career in law enforcement , becoming a sheriff 's deputy			0
he said : ' my entire life growing up was surrounded by the idea that i would be @entity84 , i would be @entity6 , i would serve dutifully â€“ duty , honor and country			0
' later i thought that i would make this [ law enforcement ] my substitution for what i thought was going to be , in the beginning , a military career , an achievement , leadership			0
' but when he lost this job after a year and a half , @entity0 began drinking heavily and partying			1
he got into several fights , before eventually being jailed for just over two years for firing a gun into a crowded restaurant			0
after being released @entity0 attempted to turn his life around and took up bodybuilding , marrying fellow bodybuilder @entity102 in 1999 and having a son with her in 2001			1
however in 2008 , a year after he and @entity102 divorced , @entity0 converted to @entity23 , and in 2012 friends began to notice that the religion was becoming all - encompassing			1
@entity0 stopped going to the gym , grew his beard , shaved his head , opened an @entity109 near to where he lived in @entity111 and began tweeting extremists views			2
@entity113 , who had known @entity0 for 15 years , said : ' his @entity115 posts were a bit extreme at times			2
derogatory statements toward @entity118 , some statements about infidels			0
' in his @entity21 interview			0
@entity0 admits that his views could be viewed as radical by @entity124 , but said that he considers himself to be just a ' practicing @entity125 '			2
he added that he was attracted to @entity13 because he admired their devotion , and that fact that they put the worship of @entity23 above everything else			1
in january this year he went to @entity11 to visit his second wife , and spent months trying to move across the border into @entity14 ' to join the most beautiful brothers on earth '			1
however , it would seem his mission ultimately failed			0
it is not known why he returned to the @entity16 , but when he landed at @entity8 , he was arrested			0
a judge has ordered @entity0 to be held without bail after attorney @entity139 suggested @entity0 was too dangerous to return to @entity2 on his own			2
judge @entity140 agreed , saying that tweets by @entity0 implied he was ' trying to go to @entity14 or @entity41 as the next step and trying to be actively engaged ' .			0

@entity0 , 44 , grew up as a @entity28 and dreamed of joining the army
he failed bootcamp and joined the police but ended up losing his job
spent time in jail before becoming a bodybuilder and getting married
soon after he got divorced he converted to @entity23 and became radicalized
went to @entity11 this year and tried to join @entity13 before being arrested
