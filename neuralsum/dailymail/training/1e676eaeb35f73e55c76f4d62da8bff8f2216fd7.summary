' nowadays getting married costs thousands and we could n't afford a traditional wedding			1

others chose to dress more traditionally , including the bride 's younger brother @entity73 who wore a smart grey suit			1
wearing one has been likened to ' being inside a teddy bear 's womb ' and , despite its unflattering look , the onesie has become a global phenomenon			0

' she added : ' at first we said in a couple of years we would renew our vows but now i would n't change anything about our wedding day			2
everyone had big smiles on their faces			0
' i did imagine getting married in a big white dress as a kid but as you get older you realise that there are things more important than spending thousands on a dress			0
' and the best thing is that we can snuggle up on the sofa in our wedding outfits			2
