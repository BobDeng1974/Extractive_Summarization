by @entity0 last updated at 5:29 pm on 14th november 2011 danger : a korma sauce bearing @entity4 's name has been issued with a recall after two people were hospitalised with botulism poisoning tv chef @entity4 was today ' distressed and upset ' after two children were taken to hospital with botulism after eating by his korma sauce			1
the two youngsters were rushed to hospital with the potentially deadly bug on sunday after eating a meal prepared with the curry sauce over the weekend			1
it is not yet known how they came down with the illness but 47,000 jars of the sauce have now been recalled			1
mr @entity4 , who developed the recipe for the sauces , was ' in shock ' after hearing about the apparent poisoning			1
his agent @entity26 told @entity27 : ' @entity4 is very upset and distressed at the minute			1
' it was a such a big shock when he was told about the illness of the children			1
it 's all very upsetting			1
' @entity4 's not just putting his name to the products , it 's a full involvement			1
' we 're furiously trying to figure out what has happened			2
' @entity4 will be leading the charge in finding out who 's responsible			2
he 's not happy about it			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity41 said the two patients from the same family are in a ' stable and improving ' condition			1
the @entity45 has advised the public not to consume jars of the sauce as it may pose a risk of botulism poisoning			2
it said a batch of the korma sauce has been recalled and is being removed from shop shelves			1
the product recall relates to 350g jars of @entity57 sauce with a best - before date of february 2013 and a batch code of @entity60			1
the sauce is made by @entity62 , the @entity63 ’s largest food manufacturer , which is responsible for more than 40 household brands including mr @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
botulism is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium @entity72 , which is the deadliest naturally occurring poison in the world and attacks the nervous system			2
the illness can be fatal in up to 10 per cent of cases , and victims can take many months to recover			2
symptoms of food - borne botulism , which include blurred vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking , can rapidly get worse and lead to muscle weakness and paralysis			1
they typically begin between 12 and 36 hours after eating a contaminated meal , but may appear in as little as six hours			2
anyone suffering these symptoms after eating the product is being advised to seek medical help urgently			2
the infection can not be spread from person to person			2
while the initial cases of illness have occurred in @entity98 , the @entity45 and @entity98 health authorities have issued a @entity63 - wide alert			1
the @entity45 said : ‘ anyone who has any of the jars from this batch of @entity57 sauce should not eat it			1
setback : @entity4 says his sauces use the best ingredients and that he personally insists on tasting each on new recipe until he knows it is just right botulism is a rare but serious illness which can lead to paralysis			1
it can be caused either by ingesting the botulinum toxin or by contamination in a wound			0
it can not be transferred from person to person			0
botulism can lead to paralysis which usually starts with the muscles in the face - particularly those in the eyes and those used for chewing - and spreads towards the limbs			1
in severe cases the breathing muscles can become paralysed , causing respiratory failure			0
botulism can be prevented by killing the spores by cooking food about 121 ° c for three minutes			0
treatment for respiratory paralysis can require a patient to be on a ventilator for weeks as well as being treated in intensive care			0
after several weeks , the paralysis usually slowly improves			0
‘ two members of the same family who have contracted botulism and have eaten from a jar of this batch of sauce have been hospitalised in @entity98			1
‘ only one jar from the batch is known to have been contaminated with @entity72 , which causes botulism , but the agency is advising people not to eat products from this batch as a precautionary measure			1
’ dr @entity153 , consultant epidemiologist at @entity154 , said : ‘ people can be reassured that botulism is rare in the @entity63			0
‘ any person , child or adult , with the symptoms should seek urgent medical advice			0
anti-toxins have proved very effective in treating the condition if treated early , although full recovery may take several months			0
’ the news will be a heavy blow to the reputation of the tv food guru ’s line of products , which includes curry and pasta sauces			1
the products are marketed on the basis that they use ‘ only the very best ingredients ’			0
mr @entity4 has promoted the sauces saying : ‘ i love food and believe great food comes from care and attention to detail			1
that ’s why i insist on tasting every recipe until it ’s just right			0
’ spores of clostridium botulinum are normally found in soil and can get into food products via contamination of farmers ’ fields			0
there have been cases in the past – although extremely rare – of the spores and associated toxin being found in food sold in cans and jars			0
the @entity200 website says just 500g of the toxin ‘ is enough to kill every human being on the planet ’ , adding : ‘ the toxins			0
block a special type of chemical called a neurotransmitter			0
neurotransmitters send messages from your brain to the rest of your nervous system			0
‘ in the case of botulism , the toxin blocks the effects of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine , which is used by your body to help stimulate muscles			0
if acetylcholine is blocked , it causes paralysis which , if left untreated , can lead to death			0
’ a spokesman for @entity62 , the makers of the sauce , said : ' the safety of consumers is of paramount importance to us			0
at this stage , we understand that the incident relates to a single jar of @entity57 sauce			0
there is no evidence of any broader contamination , no further reports of illness have been notified to the authorities and we have had no consumer complaints of illness related to this product			0
' we are working urgently with the authorities to investigate the cause of this incident , including how the jar may have been transported and stored after leaving the factory			0
while these investigations are underway , we have initiated a precautionary recall of the specific batch code in the interests of the safety of our consumers			1
