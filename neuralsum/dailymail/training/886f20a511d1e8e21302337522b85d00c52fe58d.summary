a mother with @entity1 is pregnant with her second baby since diagnosis – despite the risk of passing the virus to her child or husband			1
@entity8 said ‘ it would n’t be the @entity12 ’ if her baby is born with the illness , adding : ‘ having @entity1 would n’t affect my child ’s life			1
’ the 34 - year - old personal trainer was diagnosed with the virus in 2010 – just three months after meeting her husband , @entity18 native @entity17 , 29			1
she contracted the virus from an ex-partner who unknowingly had the disease , and although she feared her new boyfriend would call off their relationship , he vowed to support her			2
they married eight months later			2
@entity8 , who is @entity1 positive , is pregnant with her second child after she and her husband @entity17 chose to try and conceive naturally , having done so with their daughter @entity27 mrs @entity8 , from @entity29 , already has a 14 - year - old daughter from a previous relationship but her husband agreed to risk getting @entity1 so they could have a baby together			1
the couple naturally conceived their now 21 - month - old daughter , @entity27 , who was born @entity1 - free			1
despite having unprotected sex , her husband did not contract the virus either			2
they decided to try for a second baby – and are now expecting their new arrival in june			2
if an hiv - positive mother takes the appropriate anti-viral drugs during pregnancy and labour and does not breast - feed , the risk of transmitting the virus to her child is around 1 per cent			2
mrs @entity8 's viral load - the amount of @entity1 in her blood - is low , meaning the risk of transmission during sex is low			1
the couple 's daughter @entity59 was born @entity1 negative and mr @entity62 has regular tests mr @entity62 is waiting for a test to establish if he has contracted the virus while the couple were trying for their second child , who is due in june and for mrs @entity8 , this risk is further reduced given that she is an ‘ elite controller ’ – meaning her immune system is ultra-effective at controlling the virus			1
such patients are said to have a very low risk of passing on @entity1 to partners during sex or during pregnancy to an unborn child			1
both mother and baby will also be given a course of @entity83 treatment upon birth , which will help reduce the risks of transmission			2
but mrs @entity8 admitted that there is still a chance the virus could be passed on to her husband or child			1
if either were to contract the virus , they would have virtually the same life - expectancy as someone without it – but they would have to spend the rest of their lives on daily medication , with regular gp check - ups			1
if their immune system is badly compromised – through developing another illness , for example – it could develop into @entity108 , the later stage of the illness , where life expectancy is on average three years			0
mrs @entity8 said that while she would rather her child was born without the virus , she added : ‘ i would n’t be devastated if my child had @entity1			1
it is n’t a death sentence any more			0
it would n’t hold them back and they would go on to achieve everything they wanted			0
when mrs @entity8 is 20 weeks ' pregnant she will begin to take anti-retroviral drugs to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to her unborn baby			1
the drugs reduce the risk to less than 0.5 per cent , experts say mrs @entity8 said she tried to persuade her husband to opt for insemination but he refused and was adamant he wanted them to conceive naturally like a normal couple despite the low risk of transmission ‘ it has n’t ruined my life – in fact , it has got better since my diagnosis			1
having @entity1 is n’t the @entity12 , it ’s something that you live with			2
it does n’t define who you are			0
’ mrs @entity8 said her husband is tested for @entity1 every six months			1
‘ @entity17 has always supported me and is willing to get @entity1 in order for us to be a normal couple , ’ she added			1
‘ he reassured me he was n’t bothered whether he contracted @entity1 or not as i was his wife ... he wanted us to conceive naturally			1
‘ i had always wanted a family but when i was first diagnosed i thought my chances had been destroyed			0
‘ i also have an older daughter and i was worried i would n’t see her grow up but doctors … gave me hope for the future			0
‘ i want other people to understand the importance of getting checked			0
diagnosing @entity1 in the early stages saves lives			0
‘ i hope my story shows people that the disease does n’t need to hold you back			0
’ @entity156 , acting policy director at the @entity157 , an @entity1 awareness charity , said : ‘ the strength of our antenatal screening programme means the @entity162 has one of the lowest rates of mother - to - child @entity1 transmission in the world			1
‘ if a woman with @entity1 wants to start a family , the @entity168 will take every measure possible to stop the virus being passed on			1
’ @entity1 is a virus that attacks the body 's immune system - the body 's defence against diseases			1
figures published this week revealed the number of people infected with the virus in the @entity162 has reach an all - time high			0
nearly 110,000 are living with the condition , but around a quarter are unaware they have it			0
recent research has found that between 70 and 90 per cent of people may experience symptoms of infection a few days after they have been infected			0
a fever , rash and severe sore throat should always be considered a potential indicator of @entity1			0
the symptoms usually disappear within two to three weeks			0
a person described as living with @entity1 means they have @entity1 in their body			2
new figures published this week revealed the number of people infected with @entity1 , pictured under the microscope in purple and green , in the @entity162 has reached an all - time high , with 111,000 living with the condition , but around a quarter unaware they have it a person is considered to have developed @entity108 when the immune system is so weak it can no longer fight off a range of diseases , which it would normally cope with			2
there is currently no cure for @entity1			0
but those with the virus receiving treatment can live a healthy , active life			0
if the virus is diagnosed late , treatment may be less effective in preventing @entity108			0
those who are diagnosed early and respond to treatment can be healthy , work , and have relationships like anyone else			0
@entity1 treatment was transformed in 1996 with the introduction of @entity222 ( @entity222 )			0
it means a person diagnosed in time and who adheres to their medication can , in the vast majority of cases , manage their health condition and look forward to a near normal life expectancy			2
@entity222 can cause some side - effects including fatigue , depression and diarrhoea , though they are increasingly well - managed			0
how is hiv passed on ? the virus can be passed on through infected blood , semen , vaginal fluids or breast milk			2
@entity1 is most commonly passed on during : can women living with @entity1 still have a baby ? @entity1 can be passed from mother to child , but there are steps that can be taken to reduce the possibility of the child contracting @entity1 to less than one per cent			1
they include the mother taking anti-retroviral drugs while pregnant , delivering the baby via caesarean section and not breastfeeding the baby			0
