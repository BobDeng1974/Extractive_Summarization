they are the urban vehicle of choice for the well - heeled across the @entity3 – but the spiritual home of the @entity6 tractor is ... erm , @entity6			0
the gas - guzzlers are most likely to be sought after by the wealthy residents of the area of @entity10 that gave the off - road vehicle its nickname , a report out yesterday reveals			1
the home of the @entity16 beats ‘ @entity18 ’ country ’ in @entity19 , @entity21 country in leafy @entity22 , and even @entity24 in @entity25 , and parts of rural @entity27 when it comes to the popularity of @entity29			0
a recent @entity31 survey found drivers in south west @entity10 search online for 4x4 cars more than other motorists throughout the @entity3 in september , 1,955 people searched online for an off - roader in the home of the ‘ @entity16 ’ , according to research by @entity31			1
it was comfortably ahead of rural @entity42 - the real life inspiration for @entity44 ’s long - running rural soap - opera ‘ @entity18 ’ - from which there were 1,763 searches			0
it also beat @entity42 ( 1,763 searches ) , @entity49 ( 1,749 ) , @entity22 ( 1,701 ) and @entity50 ( 867 ) – rural areas for which the vehicles were designed			0
there are more than twice as many searches in the up - market @entity10 area than in @entity24 ( 953 ) , @entity57 in @entity27 ( 918 ) , @entity58 ( 909 ) , and @entity50 ( 867 ) , which takes in the @entity59			2
the website @entity61 currently offers more than 133,000 used cars , of which , more than 5,000 are 4x4s			2
the report said : ‘ whilst most 4x4s never go off road , they can be very useful vehicles to negotiate potholes , tow boats or caravans or accommodate numerous passengers who like a better view			1
though designed for tough , rural terrain , 4x4s such as @entity73 were most sought after by city dwellers according to the report ' however with restricted parking , narrow streets and no congestion charge exemptions for 4x4s in @entity10 , it is perhaps surprising that their popularity is still so strong			1
’ experts say one possible reason is that @entity29 have a similarly large ‘ footprint ’ to a @entity10 black cab so are less likely to be intimidated , bullied or cut up by other cars or big buses , and can better stand their ground in the cut and thrust of the capital ’s traffic			1
@entity95 , director of @entity31 said : ‘ it is surprising that there are more searches for 4x4s in @entity10 than in most rural counties , from @entity50 to @entity100			1
' some of this may be linked to the status of the 4x4 , the state of the roads or the fact that a proportion of @entity105 like to retreat to the countryside in their ‘ @entity6 tractors ’ at weekends			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s even been claimed that certain @entity16 used spray - on mud on their vehicles to pretend that they had been off - road			0
’ he said : ‘ as colder weather arrives we find that searches for 4x4s on @entity31 increase			2
