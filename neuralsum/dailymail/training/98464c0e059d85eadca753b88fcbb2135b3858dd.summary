but in a surprise statement , his foe @entity10 ’s glamorous lawyer predicted @entity2 will be convicted - but avoid prison			1
the farcical court case is over two ' punches ' thrown by @entity2 after he was ' provoked ' during a tv debate on the @entity18 economy			1

' anyone can see that i ’m innocent but obviously i have to prepare myself for jail , ' said @entity2 , 53			1
' what i ’m hoping for is a sentence of less than two years			2
to put it mildly , it ’s unpleasant , but i ’m mentally steeling myself			2

' a verdict in the case - which resumes in @entity1 today - is expected by early july			1
in a move which raises huge doubts that justice will be done , the judge is refusing to call ' star witness ' @entity10 , 40 , to give evidence and face cross examination at the trial on the basis that he is on bail in @entity69 facing a police probe into allegations he kidnapped and threatened a group of local sailors			2
this is despite photographic evidence that @entity10 is instead in a bolthole in @entity78 where @entity46 admits she is seeking to obtain @entity80 citizenship for her property mogul client			0

' swindlers can do anything and you will not only fail to punish but will even encourage their conduct			0
as a result , the reputation of the @entity80 @entity128 will sustain significant damage , and @entity10 will be a shame to @entity80 , after he has already become a shame in @entity18			0
' @entity46 , 31 , also claimed @entity10 ’s life could be threatened by returning to @entity18			0
