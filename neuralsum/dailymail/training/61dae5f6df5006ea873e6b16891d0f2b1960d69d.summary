' in addition , the word “ su * k ” , used as an epithet , is now common enough in modern society that it can not reasonably provoke a threat of violence			0
' the defendant ’s other statement , “ ( expletive ) the police , ” was a fleeting epithet that was insulting and inappropriate , but it did not create an immediate threat and danger of violence			0
