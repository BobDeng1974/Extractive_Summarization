the fine was cancelled today when a magistrate realised who the next defendant was on the court list she must have thought the police were kidding , so to speak			2
for the miscreant was @entity2 – @entity2 the goat that is			0
and while it was @entity2 ’s owner who had been booked , it was the goat who was the real culprit , magistrate @entity13 was told in @entity19 ’s @entity18 today			1
owner @entity20 , a comedian who is also known as @entity21 , had been issued with a £ 292 fine last august after police caught @entity2 chomping away on flowers outside @entity19 ’s @entity24 , which is located beside the city harbour			1
mr @entity21 decided the fine was unjust and elected to take the case to court			2
he took @entity2 along with him , too , but the goat , wearing a rainbow hat , was asked to remain outside while the case proceeded			0
miss @entity13 noted that ‘ he did eat garden plants			0
’ but she said there was no evidence mr @entity21 had brought @entity2 to the area with the intention of vandalising vegetation			1
‘ he may have preferred to have an ice cream , ’ she said			0
mr @entity38 , lawyer for the goat , told the court that the police had issued the wrong infringement notice because it related to a person and not a goat			2
‘ the liability ( for the fine ) attaches to a person , but @entity2 ’s not a person			0

he was not allowed into court today so waited patiently outside well - wishers kept @entity70 company as he waited for his owner to emerge victorious from court today ‘ we ca n’t guess what @entity2 might have been whispered in his goat ear			0
’ police prosecutor senior sergeant @entity74 said mr @entity21 was fined correctly because he knew @entity2 was hungry and had been reckless in letting him near the flowers			1
‘ maybe we should just have an argument on whether @entity21 or @entity2 the goat should be in the dock , ’ said mr @entity38			2
mr @entity21 told the police who dragged his goat from the flower bed that he had brought his companion to the park because he needed to eat			1
the magistrate cancelled the fine , saying it should never have been issued but dismissed mr @entity21 ’s application for the @entity89 to pay his legal costs			1
outside the court mr @entity21 told a crowd of journalists that he was delighted @entity2 ’s name had been cleared			2
‘ i just think there ’s so many laws and regulations in @entity98 which are just an abuse of common sense			0
‘ this is actually an abuse of the laws of nature – a goat eating grass			0
