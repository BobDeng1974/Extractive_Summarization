by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 3 april 2013 astronomers have managed to study the death throes of a giant star in unprecedented detail			1
a team of astronomers led by the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) have produced an astonishing image of their observation of @entity10			1
it shows radio emissions and a @entity14 image of the supernova first spotted in 1987			1
the death of a star : contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a @entity14 image of @entity10 combined to provide a unique view of its death throes in february of 1987 astronomers observing the @entity25 , a nearby dwarf galaxy , noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star			1
in fact they were n’t watching the beginnings of a star but the end of one and the brightest supernova seen from @entity36 in the four centuries since the telescope was invented			2
by the next morning news of the discovery had spread across the globe and southern hemisphere stargazers began watching the aftermath of this enormous stellar explosion , known as a supernova			0
in the two and a half decades since then , the remnant of @entity10 has continued to be a focus for researchers around the world , providing a wealth of information about one of the @entity54 ’s most extreme events			1
in research published in the @entity60 today , a team of astronomers in @entity57 and @entity58 have succeeded in using the @entity61 , @entity63 radio telescope in northern @entity64 , to make the highest resolution radio images of the expanding supernova remnant at millimetre wavelengths			2
' imaging distant astronomical objects like this at wavelengths less than 1 centimetre demands the most stable atmospheric conditions , ' said lead author , dr @entity72 of @entity7 , a joint venture of @entity74 and the @entity75 in @entity76			0
' for this telescope these are usually only possible during cooler winter conditions but even then , the humidity and low elevation of the site makes things very challenging			0
' unlike optical telescopes , a radio telescope can operate in the daytime and can peer through gas and dust allowing astronomers to see the inner workings of objects like supernova remnants , radio galaxies and black holes			2
' supernova remnants are like natural particle accelerators , the radio emission we observe comes from electrons spiralling along the magnetic field lines and emitting photons every time they turn			1
' the higher the resolution of the images the more we can learn about the structure of this object , ' said professor @entity107 , deputy director of @entity7 and @entity108 , the @entity7 for all - sky astrophysics			0
scientists study the evolution of supernovae into supernova remnants to gain an insight into the dynamics of these massive explosions and the interaction of the blast wave with the surrounding medium			0
' not only have we been able to analyse the morphology of @entity10 through our high resolution imaging , we have compared it to x-ray and optical data in order to model its likely history , ' said professor @entity125 , director of @entity108 at the @entity126			1
image of the remnants of @entity10 as seen at optical wavelengths with the @entity14 in 2011 the team suspects a compact source or pulsar wind nebula to be sitting in the centre of the radio emission , implying that the supernova explosion did not make the star collapse into a black hole			1
they will now attempt to observe further into the core and see what ’s there			0
the mysterious body first baffled researchers			0
in february of 1987 astronomers observing the @entity25 , a nearby dwarf galaxy , noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star			0

a @entity179 / @entity178 / @entity177 overlay of optical , x-ray and radio observations made by 3 different telescopes			0
in red are the 7 - mm ( @entity185 ) observations made with the @entity186 in @entity64 , in green are the optical observations made by the @entity14 , and in blue is an x-ray view of the remnant , observed by @entity193 's space based @entity191 .			2

@entity200 now hope to be able to look inside the core of the dying giant star
