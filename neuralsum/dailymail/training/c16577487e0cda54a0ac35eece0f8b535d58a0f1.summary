an amateur treasure hunter with a hand - held metal detector has turned @entity3 history on its head after finding a 16th century shilling buried in clay on the shores of @entity8			1
the 435 - year - old coin discovered in western-most @entity3 has rekindled a theory that a @entity12 explorer made a secret voyage here two centuries before it was discovered by @entity15 sailors			1
official historical records show the @entity15 were the first @entity17 to set foot in what is now @entity3 's @entity21 province in 1774 , followed four years later by @entity23 captain @entity22			1
retired security systems installer @entity24 found the coin in mid-december , along with a rare 1891 @entity3 nickel , a 1960s dime and penny from 1900			1
retired security system specialist @entity24 has found a coin that has revived a theory the @entity3 pacific coast was not discovered in 1774 by the @entity15 , as officially thought , but in 1579 by @entity12 sailor sir @entity33 this rare @entity35 shilling , minted in @entity36 between 1551 and 1553 , was found @entity37 , @entity21 , in mid-december ' i was getting fat and tired of watching tv , ' he said about what got him into his hobby , surrounded in his @entity37 , @entity21 home by a trove of adventure novels and a few dug up treasures			1
he never imagined , he said , stirring up controversy with his latest find			0
according to conspiracy theorists and some historians , the silver coin ( produced between 1551 and 1553 ) is evidence that @entity53 explorer sir @entity33 traveled as far north as @entity3 's @entity54 during an expedition to @entity56 in 1579 , in search of the famed @entity58			1
but he covered it up at the behest of queen elizabeth i , who supposedly wished to avoid confrontation over the new territory with @entity15			0
at the time , @entity15 explorers had kept to more southern parts of the continent after disappointment ( seeing few apparent resources and natural ports ) in @entity56			2
@entity70 , a leading proponent of the so - called @entity33 theory and author of a 2003 book on the subject , says the coin is proof the @entity53 arrived here first			2
he noted two other finds that support the theory : a 1571 sixpence dug up in 1930 in the backyard of a @entity37 home and another tudor - era coin unearthed on nearby @entity81			0
history rewritten : the @entity12 are known to have visited @entity56 in 1579 , while the @entity15 are believed to be the first @entity17 to arrive in @entity3 in 1774			1
however the discovery of the coin suggests the @entity12 also went to what is now @entity12 @entity86 during sir @entity88 's voyage @entity33 would have given the coins to aboriginals he met ' to show to later comers that @entity53 had already found ( and staked a claim to ) these lands , ' @entity70 told @entity94			1
royal @entity96 curator @entity95 , tasked with examining the evidence , is skeptical			0
he said his analysis typically looks at ' what was written at the time , and archeological artifacts '			0
and there is currently not enough evidence to support this theory , he said , noting that @entity33 's logs were burned in a @entity36 fire a century later			2
if it is ever corroborated , it could have implications for @entity3 and the @entity108 , whose shared border was drawn based partly on past @entity17 colonial land holdings			2
the 49th parallel was chosen in 1818 as the western boundary between the @entity108 and the @entity12 colony , but disputes over interpretations of the treaty erupted on several occasions since then			0
the last row was settled in 1903 by a joint @entity12 , @entity3 and @entity108 tribunal establishing @entity3 's boundary with @entity122			0
for @entity24 , the coin is nothing more than a lucky find that will be hard to match			0
' it 's gon na be impossible to find something older , ' he quipped .			0

retired security systems installer @entity24 started hunting for treasure with a hand - held metal detector because he was sick of tv and ' getting fat '
in december he found a rare @entity35 shilling - minted in @entity36 between 1551 and 1553 - in clay on the shores of @entity8
the find has *reignited* a theory that the @entity12 were the first @entity17 to set foot in @entity3 and not the @entity15
the coin is believed to have been placed by @entity53 explorer sir @entity33 during his *circumnavigation* of the world between 1577 and 1580
@entity33 is *documented* to have visited @entity56 in 1579 , but was *rumored* to have traveled further north
official records show the @entity15 were the first to reach @entity3 two centuries later , in 1774
