by @entity0 an ‘ astonishing ’ drug that has apparently cured a man dying of skin cancer was hailed by doctors yesterday			1
they say the results of medical trials are ‘ jaw - dropping ’ and offer hope for victims of other forms of cancer			1
the medicine , pembrolizumab , is the latest in a new generation of ‘ immunotherapy ’ treatments that prevent cancers from shielding themselves from the immune system			1
instead it lets the immune system attack the disease , often in conjunction with other conventional drugs			1
doctors say ' jaw - dropping ' results from medical trials involving medicine pembrolizumab could offer hope for millions of cancer sufferers ( stock pic ) the drug was tested on melanoma because the prospects for patients with advanced forms of the disease are so grim – only 10 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women survive a year			1
but in the trial involving 411 patients , 69 per cent were still alive 12 months after starting on immunotherapy			1
the ‘ cured ’ patient , 64 - year - old @entity42 from @entity43 , west @entity44 , has had six months of treatment with the drug , which is injected into the bloodstream			1
after three months his tumours had almost vanished and they show no sign of returning			2
his consultant , @entity49 of the @entity50 in @entity44 , said : ‘ we can not say for certain that he ’s been cured , but he is doing very well			2
‘ he was aware that without an effective treatment his survival prospects were not good – maybe months			2
@entity56 looks like it has potential to be a paradigm shift for cancer therapy and is firmly helping to establish immunotherapy as one of the most exciting and promising treatment modalities in recent years			2
a 64 - year - old man from @entity44 , who had six months of treatment with the drug , improved dramatically ‘ this is one of several new drugs of this type being produced			1
what these early trials are showing is that they are fulfilling their promise ridiculously fast			0
‘ some of these results are really astonishing ; almost jaw - dropping			1
and these drugs may be applicable to many different cancer types , including ones that are hard to treat such as lung cancer			0
‘ cancers adapt to treatments , and when they come back they are harder to treat			0
can we dream about actually curing some of our patients with very advanced cancer ? ‘ once we get the immune system attacking the cancer , can it act independently to keep the cancer under control ? ‘ we do n’t have all the answers yet , but that ’s what we ’re looking at			1
’ @entity56 is a man - made antibody that blocks a biological pathway – programmed cell death 1 or @entity91 – that cancers use to shield themselves from the immune system			1
in healthy individuals , @entity91 is part of the process that applies a ‘ brake ’ to the immune system			1
by removing the brake , the immune system is freed to do the job of defeating the cancer			1
@entity56 was generally well tolerated by the trial patients , said dr @entity49 , although responses varied widely			0
results were presented at the annual meeting of the @entity108 in @entity109			0
clinicians do not yet know exactly how pembrolizumab might affect survival chances			0
after 18 months , 62 per cent of patients were still alive and undergoing treatment			2
around 80 per cent of patients responded to the drug in some way – an unusually high proportion			2
seventy - two per cent experienced tumour shrinkage , including 39 per cent whose tumours were more than halved in size			0
additional data showed the drug also reduced the size of advanced non-small cell lung cancers by up to 47 per cent			0
it is being tested on 30 forms of the disease , including cancers of the head and neck			0
the drug was tested on melanoma ( pictured ) because the prospects for patients with advanced forms of the disease are grim - only 10 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women survive a year @entity56 ’s @entity139 manufacturer , @entity138 , is expected to apply for a @entity141 licence to market the drug within months			1
it is being fast - tracked in the @entity139			0
the price is not known			0
each year , around 13,300 people in the @entity144 are diagnosed with melanoma – more than a third of them under 55			0
@entity147 , founder of the charity @entity144 , said : ‘ advanced melanoma is a terrible disease with a poor prognosis			0
‘ @entity56 represents the latest advance in a whole raft of new treatments in advanced melanoma which have come through over the past few years			0
‘ these results are really exciting and could represent a turning point for patients affected by advanced melanoma giving them a greater chance of survival			2

' immunotherapy ' drug pembrolizumab lets immune system attack the disease
doctors say medical trials show ' jaw - dropping ' results for cancer patients
one man , @entity42 , 64 , apparently ' cured ' from skin cancer after taking drug for six months
