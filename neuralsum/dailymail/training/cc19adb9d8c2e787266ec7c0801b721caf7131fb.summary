wondering if that glass of wine has pushed you over the driving limit ? now a tiny breathalyser that plugs into a mobile phone has been developed , allowing people to test the alcohol content of their blood before getting into the car			1
the @entity10 plugs into @entity12 smartphones and displays a person 's @entity13			1
its developers claim it is the ' smallest breathalyser in the world ' and claim it is accurate to 0.001 per cent @entity13 ( @entity13 ) @entity10 works by being plugged into an @entity12 phone , following the app ’s instructions to blow into it , and then @entity13 results will be displayed within a fraction of a second			1
@entity13 gives the percentage of alcohol in the blood in order to measure alcohol intoxication - for example , the @entity29 drink drive limit is 0.08 per cent @entity13			1
in the @entity37 , the limit is also 0.08 per cent			1
however in people with a bac of 0.05 per cent or above , some states may apply a lesser charge - sometimes referred to as ' driving while ability impaired '			2
in @entity43 , the legal limit is 0.05 per cent			2
@entity10 's @entity37 developers claim it is the smallest breathalyser available on the market and is accurate to approximately 0.001 per cent @entity13			1
the maximum alcohol reading the device can measure is 0.20 per cent @entity13 - a level where there is the possibility of falling unconscious			1
the company claims the accuracy was validated using testing and calibration kits from @entity56 , a manufacturer of professional breath testers			1
however it has not been tested by independent authorities			0
the device works by being plugged into an @entity12 phone			0
users then follow the app ’s instructions to blow into it			0
the results are then displayed ' within a fraction of a second '			0
however the developers recommended users wait between 15 and 20 minutes after their last drink before testing their blood alcohol reading			2
smoking or eating during this time could also affect the reading			0
the device - which measures 1.7 inches in length and 0.62 inches in diameter - is so small because it has no internal battery			0
instead , power is supplied from the @entity12 phone via the @entity80 port			0
the developers - @entity82 , an electromechanical engineer , and @entity84 , an engineer , physicist and app develope - claim the energy used to power the breathalyser is negligible for short periods of time on any phone			2
they are using @entity92 so that they can take a large quantity of orders at once , lowering manufacturing costs			0
an @entity97 version is not currently available , but may be developed depending on the success of the @entity12 version			0
for more information , visit the @entity92 page			0
the @entity29 drink drive limit is 0.08 per cent @entity13 , and developers say @entity10 measures up to 0.20 per cent @entity13 , a level of intoxication at which loss of consciousness is possible			1

@entity10 plugs into @entity12 phones and displays @entity13
@entity13 is a measure of how much alcohol is present per unit of blood
developers claim its the smallest breathalyser in the world at 1.7 " @entity121 "
the @entity29 and @entity37 drink drive limit is 0.08 per cent @entity13 , and 0.05 in @entity43
say its accuracy has been validated using testing and calibration kits from a manufacturer of professional breath testers
