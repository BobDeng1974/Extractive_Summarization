it marks the moment when the civilised world entered the @entity3 and some of the most spectacular societies in the world disappeared			1
now one historian claims he has unraveled what may have lead to the downfall of @entity9 and other @entity11 civilisations collapse			1
he claims they were hit by a ' perfect storm ' of disasters 3,200 years ago that left the @entity15 , the @entity16 , minoans and @entity18 unable to cope			1
@entity19 and pyramids at @entity21 ( above ) hint at the power of ancient @entity25 civilisation before it collapsed as each of these great societies were interconnected , the collapse of one also affected the others , creating a domino - like effect , claims professor @entity32 , director of the @entity33 at @entity34			1
he claims that a series of droughts , famines , climate change , earthquakes , invasions and internal rebellions between @entity42 and 1177 @entity43 happened in quick succession			1
@entity9 's @entity47 - when most of the pyramids were built - collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change , according to research			1
scientists examined 7,000 - year - old ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the @entity53 to piece together the time - and found evidence of a ' mega drought ' in the the area			2
the droughts brought fires , famine and social unrest to the region			2
pollen grains obtained from the bottom of the @entity64 have also provided similar evidence that the region endured a 150 year drought between @entity68 and @entity69			0
scientists behind the study say there was a sharp decline around 1250 bce in oaks , pines , and carob trees â€” the traditional flora of the @entity78 in the @entity11			0
plants usually found in semiarid desert regions increase while the number of olive trees - an important crop plant - also declined			0
speaking to @entity85 , he said : ' normally if a culture if faced with just one of these tragedies , it can survive it , but what if they all happened at once or in quick succession			0
' i think that the @entity11 civilisations were simply unable to weather the " perfect storm " and cam crashing down			0
' the thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium @entity99 , which had stretched from @entity100 to @entity9 and @entity101 , suddenly ceased to exist , long - used trade routes were abandoned , along with writing systems , advanced technology , and monumental architecture			2
' professor @entity32 sets out his arguments in his recent book ' @entity109 collapsed '			1
the claims the events that led up to the collapse of these civilisations marked a turning point in ancient history			1
the demise of the powerful ancient civilisations has long been blamed on a mysterious group of seafaring raiders known as the @entity120			2
these marauding people have been credited with having invaded and destroyed large swathes of @entity9 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity126 kingdoms around the @entity78			0
a series of battles between the @entity25 and the @entity120 's are depicted on the @entity130 wall relief at @entity132 's tomb on the west bank of @entity134 in @entity9			2
the @entity120 , shown here fighting ancient @entity25 forces , were widely blamed for the collapse of many of the great civilisations in the @entity139 and @entity78 at the end of the bronze age 3,200 years ago the map above shows many of the suspected invasions made by the @entity120 around 1200 @entity43 although the @entity25 apparently managed to defeat them , the kingdom never recovered			1
@entity146 , a port city in ancient @entity148 that traded with the @entity123 and @entity9 was destroyed and the involvment of @entity120 's is mentioned in four letters found at the site of the city			2
archaeologists also point to the widespread destruction around much of the @entity78 at the time			0
many @entity157 sties show signs of violent battles and abandonment			0
coastal sites at @entity162 , including @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , in @entity168 , were also leveled while the inland palace at @entity170 was burnt to the ground			0
the ancient cities of @entity173 and @entity174 , also in @entity168 , were completely destroyed and left abandoned			2
the tomb of @entity132 ( above ) in @entity134 , @entity9 , features a wall relief that shows battles with the @entity120 however professor @entity32 says in his book that the @entity120 's may have been unfairly blamed for causing the collapse of these great civilisations			1
instead he says while the raids may have been a menace , there were greater forces at work			0
recent analysis of pollen found in a core sample taken from the @entity64 by researchers at @entity191 and the @entity192 has shown that the years between @entity68 and @entity193 were the driest the area had seen in the @entity11 and @entity196 ages			0
@entity198 tables found in @entity199 in @entity168 , @entity200 in @entity201 and @entity202 in @entity101 and @entity146 in @entity148 also suggest the area was hit by an unrelenting drought			0
professor @entity32 says as each of the civilisations relied upon each other for trade , the misery of one was shared by others			1
@entity132 's reign was plagued by raids by seafaring people but also coincidence with a great drought he said : ' i would argue that the civilizations of the @entity78 and the ancient @entity139 were so interconnected ... that when one collapsed , it affected the others , so that one by one they fell , like a chain of dominoes			1
' the fact that similarly - intertwined civilizations collapsed just after 1200 @entity99 should be a warning to us ; if it happened once , it can happen again			2
' indeed professor @entity32 warns that he can see parallels between the events that led to the downfall of those ancient societies and those occurring today			1
he warns that the threat posed by the @entity100 economy as well as the chaos in @entity236 , @entity148 , @entity9 and @entity237 mirror some of the situations seen at the end of the @entity11			0
however , it hard to argue that these countries now represent the dominant powers in the world			0
however @entity32 even suggests that @entity244 could be the modern day equivalent of the @entity120 , sparking mass migrations and destablising the lands they invade			1
he said : ' even with all of our technological advancements , we are not immune			0

historian @entity32 at @entity34 says a series of disasters between @entity42 and @entity109 led to downfall of ancient societies
he argues that as they all relied on each other for trade the collapse of one society created a domino effect that resulted in the start of the @entity3
he makes the claims in his book @entity109 collapsed
