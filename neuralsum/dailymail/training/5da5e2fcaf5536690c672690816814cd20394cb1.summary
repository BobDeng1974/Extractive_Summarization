a seven - year - old is hoping to win the junior golf world championships - despite being allergic to the sun. @entity3 spends as much time as possible on the golf course , even though he has a rare disorder meaning he can only play for short periods of time in direct sunlight			1
he has been diagnosed with solar urticaria , as he breaks out in hives or a rash when he is exposed to ultraviolet light , uv radiation or sometimes even visible light			1
after going out in the sun he also develops migraines , feels nauseous , loses his strength and becomes lethargic			1
despite his allergy , he has won prizes in a string of tournaments @entity3 's condition is particularly bad at the first sign of sunlight in march and april and in the height of the summer			1
every day he takes an antihistamine tablet and half a migraine tablet â€“ as well as wearing prescription suncream			1
but his parents say even while taking his tablets , he struggles to last more than four hours playing golf			1
despite his allergy , @entity3 took part in his first tournaments last year and now hopes to win the @entity49 at @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52			2
he developed a love of golf when he was just two years old , when his parents @entity55 and @entity57 bought him a ' @entity59 ' set for his second birthday			2
they noticed he had freak accuracy when putting across the living room			0
mrs @entity64 , 27 , of @entity65 , @entity66 , said : ' @entity3 started with golf when he got a @entity59 set for his second birthday and it became like an obsession for him			1
' he would spend hours walking backwards and forwards across the living room collecting his ball			0
solar uticaria is a rare condition in which a person breaks out in hives , weals and nettle rash if they are exposed to sunlight			1
solar urticaria is found worldwide , and while it can start at any age , people aged between 20 and 40 who are most affected			2
it is caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells			0
exactly how and why certain types of sunlight cause this is currently uncertain			0
the appearance of solar urticaria can be quite dramatic as it usually develops within just a few minutes after exposure to sunlight			2
the main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching , stinging and burning			0
rarely , the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache , nausea , vomiting , and in such cases it is advisable to seek emergency treatment			0
source : @entity106 of @entity107 ' we actually had to buy three sets so he had one at ours and one at each of his grandparents ' to save us taking it with us wherever we went			0
' for his third birthday we got @entity3 a set of golf clubs and began taking him to the driving range			1
' it was then that we actually realised that he was a good putter			0
' when he was out on the putting green people would stop and watch , surprised at his talent			0
' several times people went to get other people to come outside and see how good he actually was			0
' in terms of his allergy , it is not known why sunlight causes an allergic reaction in some people			0
@entity3 's family believe it could be because was born prematurely - which has left him with a weak immune system			1
mrs @entity64 , who works handling complaints for @entity137 , said : ' @entity3 loves golf but it can be hard for him to play			1
' he has a sun allergy which causes a full body rash with nausea and sickness			2
' we have found a balance of two medications and a prescription suncream			1
' while these do n't take away the symptoms altogether , they do alleviate them enough to allow him to play golf for short periods			0
' @entity3 was born eight weeks prematurely , weighing just 4lbs and had to spend many weeks in special care before coming home with us			2
' as a result of his prematurity , we have found @entity3 does have a weaker immune system than most			2
' it is improving now , but he has had dozens of infections - chest , ear and tonsils - and also was hospitalised with pneumonia			0
' we have to be careful with him over the winter when he picks up more illnesses			0
' it can mean he is late to start his golfing season or can practice less than he would in the summer			0
' she added that @entity3 knows how to manage his allergy but often tries to continue playing golf even when he is not feeling 100 per cent			1
@entity3 is now set to play in the @entity171 in @entity50 , @entity51 , in july			1
he is pictured here with his golf coach @entity173 , who he says is his inspiration @entity3 has his heart set on playing golf professionally , but his parents worry he sometimes carries on playing even when he is not feeling well			1
his mother @entity57 said : ' for @entity3 giving up golf is not an option ' mrs @entity64 said : ' for @entity3 , giving up golf is not an option			1
' it 's all he wants to do and instead we just have to take more care over where and what time he can play			0
' it does impact him when he is playing at times			0
he can struggle to concentrate if he has broken out in hives as they can cause constant itching			0
but the worst problem for him is the migraines			0
' @entity3 had a tremendous year , with highlights including finishing sixth in his age group in the @entity196 at the famous @entity197 , @entity198 , and coming second in the @entity200 grand final at @entity201			2
the seven - year - old has now qualified to play the @entity203 in @entity204 in may and for the @entity171 in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , at the end of july			1
mrs @entity64 added : ' @entity3 's favourite golfer is @entity207 , but his biggest inspiration is his golf coach @entity173			1
' when @entity3 was asked what he wanted to be when he grows up he told me he wanted to be @entity173 , and that if he could n't be a professional golfer he wanted to teach children to play			2
