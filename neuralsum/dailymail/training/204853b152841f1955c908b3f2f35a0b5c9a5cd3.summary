by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 24 june 2013 these stunning images show an enormous swarm of long - tailed mayflies magically rising out of the water to mate			1
the spectacular show on the @entity7 , near @entity8 in @entity9 , only lasts for a few hours because the mayflies - also known as @entity7 flies because of their prevalence in the river - live for just one day			1
the @entity7 fly ' blooming season ' occurs from late spring to early summer each year and the whole river becomes infested with millions of mayflies taking to the air to frantically find a mate before they die			1
fascinating yet frightening : tourists ride a boat to watch long - tailed mayflies on the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 the bizarre natural phenomenon has become quite a tourist attraction , with many people planning trips to watch the huge insects , which can measure as long as five inches from tip to tail			1
the larvae of long - tailed mayfly , known officially as @entity31 , develop in the mud for up to three years before hatching			1
they live in in tunnels deep beneath the river bed , sometimes at a density of 400 tunnels per square metre			0
after reaching the adult stage , adults only have about three hours to mate before they die , which causes groups of males will to desperately fly about to try find a suitable female			2
once they have found a mate , the long - tailed mayflies copulate on the surface of the 135km - long river south - east of @entity48			1

once they have found a mate , the long - tailed mayflies mate on the surface of the 135km - long river southeast of @entity48			1
but there is no romance in the mayfly courtship repertoire			0
@entity63 is often a forced act with as many as 20 males pursuing a lone , harried female			0
unlike other mayfly species , the adults never lose contact with the water surface , trailing their tails along it as they swarm			0
the slow flow of the @entity7 and absence of surface - feeding fish in its waters help make this possible females will fly between one and three km before laying their eggs on the river , which then sink to the bottom and hatch after about 45 days			2
when larvae finally break for the surface of the river three years later females moult once and males shed twice before reaching full sexual maturity			0
unlike other mayfly species , @entity7 flies never lose contact with the water surface , trailing their tails along it as they swarm females will fly between one and three km before laying their eggs on the river , which then sink to the bottom and hatch after about 45 days living fossils : mayflies are part of an ancient group of insects termed the @entity97 , which also contains dragonflies and damselflies sometimes the mayflies become confused , however , and mistake wet road surfaces for the river mayfly larvae and the adults emerging from the water are a vital source of food for many other freshwater creatures , especially fish such as trout and salmon the name ¿ mayfly ¿ is misleading because this group of insects can appear throughout the year			1
@entity7 flies ten to emerge in june mayflies are part of an ancient group of insects termed the @entity97 , which also contains dragonflies and damselflies			2
@entity120 's observation of the creatures ' brief lifespans inspired him to dub them , poetically , the ' ephemeron '			0
both the larvae and the adults play a vital role in river ecosystems because they are a vital source of food for many other freshwater creatures , especially fish such as trout and salmon			0
now extinct in many @entity136 countries , the presence of @entity134 is an indicator of clean unpolluted water			0
as well as in @entity9 , they can still also be found in the @entity7 where it flows through @entity141 , along the @entity142 in @entity143 and in the lower @entity145 basin .			2

long - tailed mayflies are also known as @entity7 flies because they are so prevalent on the @entity7 in @entity9
they frantically take to the air to find a mate before they *reproduce* on the surface of the water and die hours later
the annual @entity7 fly ' bloom ' occurs every year and has become a *popular* tourist attraction
in antiquity observations of the creatures ' short life - span earned them the name ' ephemeron '
