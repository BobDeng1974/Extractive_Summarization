it 's not something parking wardens are usually accused of ... but some have been criticised for being too nice			1
an inspection in two @entity6 towns found officers there were reluctant to issue tickets , letting many locals get away with parking offences			1
and their lax approach meant that parking in the evenings and at weekends had become a ‘ free for all ’			0
inspectors in @entity16 and @entity17 have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements ( file picture ) the investigation was carried out by officials from @entity24 , who could not understand why the council was losing money on enforcing parking restrictions			1
@entity30 council needs to issue 40 per cent more tickets just to break even			1
councillors shadowed wardens three times in the towns of @entity16 and @entity17 and found there were plenty of infringements , but many were going unticketed			1
in one case , a driver had already overrun their allotted time by 15 minutes , but the warden ‘ still appeared to be reluctant to issue the ticket ’			0
officials also often did not penalise tradesmen for parking in restricted areas – even though only water and electricity vehicles are allowed to stop in them without permits			0
the councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘ would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule ’			0
even when tickets were issued , 39 per cent were cancelled at the first challenge			2
the councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘ would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule ’ ( file picture ) the investigators suggested a range of actions to toughen up the operation , including shortening the grace period drivers are given after their time runs out before a ticket is issued			0
they said wardens are currently leaving it ‘ too long ’ , particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time			2
they also said ticketing policies need to be more consistent across @entity30 as ‘ decisions are made locally and sometimes contrary to police recommendations ’			2
some 5,000 tickets are issued in @entity30 , bringing in £ 1.2million a year , but the council is still subsidising the operation			1
the report said 7,000 tickets would need to be issued to make the service ‘ cost neutral ’ .			0
