more than £ 10million has been spent settling compensation claims in schools , including £ 600 after a child was hit by a piece of apple			1
the legal action was one of thousands taken out by pupils and staff against their schools in @entity10 and @entity11 in the last three years			2
@entity12 has so far racked up £ 575 in legal fees fighting the case after the pupil who was hit by the apple in march 2010 sued			1
compensation culture : millions of pounds have been spent by schools setlling claims made by pupils and teachers other payments included one student who was handed £ 7,800 after falling off their own skateboard , £ 8,000 to a member of staff who was hit with a ball , and £ 55,000 for a primary school child who bumped his head			1
in one @entity33 primary school a pupil received £ 50 after falling out of a tree			1
figures obtained under the @entity36 show schools are even paying out pupils who become embroiled in playground fights			1
in @entity40 one student was handed £ 1,925 following a fight , while at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , another was paid £ 43			1
despite the huge sums of money spent on the cases most were found to be baseless when investigated			0
and now critics have slammed the ' ridiculous ' compensation culture in schools , saying it harms children 's education because teachers are wrapping kids up in cotton wool to avoid payouts			1
chairman of @entity60 said : ' there is a compensation culture in schools			1
' while there is negligence , and schools need to ensure children are in a safe environment , they should be able to exercise a degree of common sense			2
' the courts should protect schools from spurious claims , because too often the claims are against events which are a normal part of the rough and tumble of everyday life			2
' the problem is that schools are now spending a lot of time worried that they might be sued and so they 're wrapping children in cotton wool			1
' the real price is not just financial			0
the real price is that these children are losing what we would consider to be a " normal " childhood because it 's a risk - averse childhood wrapped in cotton wool so children do n't take any risks			1
' that 's no preparation for adult life			0
schools are obsessed by the need to ensure that there are no claims and therefore children are missing out on the adventure and magic and childhood			2
' chief executive of the @entity101 , said : ' our worrying schoolyard compensation culture is not only a burden on taxpayers but is also undermining children 's time in the classroom			1
' some of these incidents range from the sublime to the ridiculous , with many either nobody 's fault or easily avoidable			0
' every penny spent on payouts for a bump or thrown apple means less cash for textbooks and sports equipment			2
' a @entity121 spokesperson said : ' compensation payments are agreed on a case by case basis and the department has no role in the process			2
' topping the list of local authorities that have had to fork out the most cash was @entity131 , which racked up a bill of £ 1,148,186 settling claims			2
worried : chief executive of the @entity135 , @entity101 ( right ) , said every penny spent on compensation was one less spent in the classroom			0
left , a model plays hopscotch a huge £ 2,430.604,62 was claimed on behalf of primary school children , £ 2,363,275.55 from secondary school children and £ 5,550,056.04 claimed by staff working at schools			1
a director at @entity146 , which had the second - largest total at £ 794,815.18 , said accidents were inevitable			0
@entity149 , who is responsible for schools , said : ' we would prefer it that no one was ever hurt in an accident while at school			0
' but in a county with nearly 10,000 teachers and well over 160,000 school - age children it is inevitable that there will be some incidents resulting in injuries , thankfully mostly minor			0
' when the county council receives a claim for compensation it has to make a decision regarding its liability , and defend or settle the case as appropriate			0
' this may lead to a compensation payment being made			0
' a spokesman for @entity173 , which had the third - highest total at £ 785,485.31 , said : ' @entity173 takes its health , safety and wellbeing responsibilities seriously and is committed to complying with its legal , moral and financial obligations			0
' when a claim is made it is investigated thoroughly and payment made if the claim is successful			0
' it is also worth noting that @entity173 is one of the largest local authorities in the country with a greater number of schools within its boundaries so the numbers will be naturally higher			0
