by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 26 october 2013 newly - released tablet computers from @entity3 and @entity4 could put children at risk of stumbling across porn because they do not come fitted with filters , an expert warned last night			1
@entity3 has brought out a cheap device called a @entity10 , while @entity4 has introduced @entity11 which is aimed specifically at ‘ tweenies ’ aged from eight to 13			1
both are expected to be bought by hundreds of thousands of parents for their children at @entity16			1
@entity3 's @entity19 tablets , which cost £ 119 , could put children at risk of stumbling across porn , an expert has warned but the @entity3 tablet , which retails for just £ 119 , does not come supplied with pre-installed filters which protect against adult materials being viewed by youngsters			1
neither does @entity4 ’s device , costing £ 100 - despite advertising that it comes with ‘ parental controls ’			1
@entity31 , from the @entity30 on internet safety , said he was worried that the devices could expose young children to hardcore imagery			0
many other popular tablets , such as the @entity37 , also do not come with such filters , but mr @entity31 said @entity3 and @entity4 had greater responsibility because their cheaper models were more likely to be used by children			1
he said he believed that @entity3 had ‘ dropped a clanger ’ , because with the @entity19 ‘ you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds ’			1
‘ @entity4 in particular needs to re-examine what they are doing , ’ he said			0
‘ they expressly state that they are going after 8 to 13 year olds			0
in other words they are going after young children			0
’ he added : ‘ i imagine hundreds of thousands will be heading into children ’s @entity16 stockings this year			1
‘ this makes it all the more disappointing that companies that ought to know better have not gone the extra mile to make these devices as safe as they can be when they come out of the box			0
‘ true enough , other tablets on the market may not be any better than a @entity10 when it comes to online child safety , but other tablets are not manufactured by a flagship @entity67 company			1
’ last night @entity3 said it was ‘ leading the way ’ on providing parents with information on how to protect their children , such as by giving them advice on filters when they switch on the @entity19 for the first time			1
they said they had been advised by charity @entity76 that this sort of education was more effective than installing a filter which can never block everything			0
the @entity82 has been campaigning in favour of an automatic block on online porn , with content blocked unless the user can prove via a strict age verification check that they are over 18			0
charities warn that easy access to adult materials can have damaging effects on youngsters , including warping young boys ’ views of how to treat girls			0
@entity3 and @entity4 both offer tablet computers that are considerably cheaper than @entity37 models the latest study by @entity103 fund that 37 per cent of children aged just three and four are going online , and 9 per cent are using tablets			1
these figures are likely to increase as the availability of cheaper tablets such as the @entity19 gathers pace			2
in july , @entity111 said he wanted to see all homes to be asked whether they wanted to install child - friendly filters			1
but on his blog , mr @entity31 said that @entity3 had undermined what the prime minister was demanding			1
@entity3 ’s failing comes despite the fact that it has a representative on the high - level @entity120 , which brings industry and campaigners together with ministers			1
a member of the board is @entity3 ’s @entity67 head of product development @entity127			1
mr @entity31 ’s blog goes on : ‘ straight out of the box if you only click @entity137 or @entity138 , depending on the wi - fi connection that happens to be available , you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds			2
‘ @entity3 have dropped a clanger			2
this is all the more surprising because elsewhere in the forest @entity3 have shown considerable leadership when it comes to online safety			2
’ mr @entity31 said he accepted that when the @entity10 is activated , a screen comes up saying ; ‘ sharing your @entity10 with a child ? ’ which gives advice about installing a filter			2
but he said that in many cases it would be children themselves switching the tablet on for the first time – and they would not heed warnings about filters			2
even if the parent looks at the advice , it is so lengthy that , on christmas morning , ‘ eyes will glaze over ’			0
‘ murder and mayhem have broken out in the living room , ’ he said			0
‘ you might resolve to come back and check out the safety stuff later , but you wo n’t			0
‘ @entity166 or little @entity167 will be off on their voyage of discovery with potentially disastrous results			0
’ last night a spokesman for @entity3 said : ‘ we asked the experts , like @entity174 , for advice			2
they were clear that the key is awareness raising and education			0
‘ we created an overlay screen that clearly guides users on online protection , going beyond what other manufacturers currently do			0
‘ we tested a wide range of filters but none of those currently blocks all harmful content			2
we did n’t want to offer parents a solution we did n’t have complete confidence in			0
if a reliable filter becomes available we will use it			0

@entity3 has brought out @entity10 , costing £ 119 , and @entity11 , at £ 100
