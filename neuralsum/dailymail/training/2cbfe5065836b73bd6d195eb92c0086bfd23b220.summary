for all his bravado about his drug use in his new memoirs , @entity0 appears to have shrunk from revealing all the famous places where he has taken cocaine			2
the list , in his new book @entity6 , includes @entity9 , the @entity10 and @entity11			1
but @entity0 left off two high - profile locations he had previously admitted to , that could land him in trouble			2
in his new book @entity15 , comedian @entity0 , 57 , ( pictured ) admits taking cocaine at a number of high - profile institutions including @entity9 , the @entity10 , @entity11 and at @entity19 however , he fails to mention in the book that he took it at the @entity22 ( pictured ) and at 10 @entity23 in a radio interview in 2012 , @entity0 claimed he had also taken the class a drug in the @entity22 and at 10 @entity23			1
he told @entity27 station @entity26 : ‘ i thought i might begin my next book by having simply a list of all the places where i ’ve taken a line of cocaine			0
' like a bathroom in @entity9 , in the gents in 10 @entity23 , in the @entity22 , in this place , in this place			0
’ @entity0 , 57 , did not identify which president or prime minister were in office at the time , and a reluctance to embarrass the politicians may explain why he left the locations off the list			1
admitting criminal behaviour in the @entity22 could also have serious repercussions for the actor			0
@entity47 can bar anyone who has admitted drugs offences from entering the country , even if they have not been charged			0
@entity0 , 57 , ( pictured meeting @entity52 earlier this year ) appeared to forget when writing his new book that he already admitted that he had taken the @entity55 drug at the two high - profile locations in a radio interview in 2012			1

comedian said he also took it at @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity19
