@entity2 @entity1 captain @entity0 has waded into the bitter @entity4 debate by labelling @entity5 a new club			1
and the 49 - year - old former @entity8 skipper insists the @entity10 oufit simply are n't strong enough to pose any threat to the @entity13 champions when they meet at @entity15 on sunday			0
the two @entity18 sides go head to head in the @entity22 semi final for the first time since april 2012 , three months before @entity16 were liquidated and a newco was subsequently accepted into the fourth - tier of @entity13 football			1
@entity2 @entity1 captain @entity0 has waded into the bitter @entity4 debate by labelling @entity5 a new club the fixture has caused a re-emergence of the controversial and divisive debate over whether @entity5 ' died ' three years ago			1
at the weekend , @entity1 fans paid for a full page advert in a @entity13 broadsheet newspaper claiming @entity5 were a new club and that the ' @entity4 ' derby was dead			1
former @entity5 midfielder @entity34 was one of several ex @entity10 aces to hit back , accusing @entity1 fans of ' provocation '			1
and @entity38 greats @entity36 and @entity39 both insisted sunday 's fixture will be as important as any previous @entity4			0
but @entity0 , who won three @entity13 titles , three @entity22 cups and two @entity13 cups during his time at @entity1 between 1992 and 2003 , disagrees as he tipped defeat for @entity47 's men at @entity15			1
' i do n't know what most people think but my opinion is that they are a new club , ' @entity0 told the @entity53			1
after a slow start to the season , @entity54 's @entity1 are currently top of the @entity58 ' a lot of people believe it 's a continuation of the game			2
i 'd imagine that the atmosphere will be very much the same as previously but you ca n't compare the teams to the way that it was			0
the new @entity5 are a ( @entity13 ) championship team , previously they had internationalists so the game is n't going to be the same			2
' a lot of former players miss the actual match			0
that fixture was where players were judged and that 's something that is no longer there because of the situation with the new @entity5 and the problems they find themselves in			2
' there are some @entity1 supporters who go along with the continuation opinion			2
they want that game back , it 's something that they miss. ' in @entity13 football they feel that @entity1 need a challenge			2
that fixture provided it - but i ca n't see the same with this match on sunday			0
' last month , @entity90 chief executive @entity89 repeated the view of lord @entity92 , whose independent report into the @entity10 club 's use of the controversial employee benefit trust ( @entity98 ) tax scheme insisted @entity5 were not a new club			1
@entity47 and @entity5 , meanwhile are second in the @entity100 @entity89 told the @entity101 : ' in terms of the question about old club , new club , that was settled very much by the @entity106 commission that was put together by the @entity107 to look at @entity98 payments at that time			1
' the decision , very clearly from the commission , was that the club is the same , the club continues , albeit it is owned by a new company , but the club is the same			0
it 's the same club , absolutely			0
' off the field , @entity5 remain mired in financial uncertainty in 2015			2
this week the under - fire board accepted a £ 10million crisis loan from @entity120 's sports direct empire to keep the lights on			0
@entity0 is tipping @entity1 , inspired by the returning striker @entity122 – who missed saturday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity124 - to add to the @entity10 woes by knocking them out of the cup on sunday			1
he said : ' the @entity124 game on saturday was a little bit sticky but @entity1 's recent form has been good in stages with some fantastic football played			1
' the passing game that @entity1 use could be too much for @entity5 but my concern at the moment is that the conversion rate of chances is n't what it should be and that 's not just to do with strikers			1
hopefully that will change on sunday			0
' having @entity122 back in the side will be important			0
last week against @entity143 he showed his value to the side with two great crosses for the opening goals			0
i 'm sure he 'll be looking forward to being involved in this match			0

@entity1 and @entity5 face each other on saturday in the @entity22
it will be the first time they *'ve* played since april 2012
but @entity0 , and others , say @entity5 are a new club
