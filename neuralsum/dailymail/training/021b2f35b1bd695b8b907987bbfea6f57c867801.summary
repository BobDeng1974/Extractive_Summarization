the 76 - year - old ’s prison term was swiftly reduced to one year because of a 2006 amnesty law aimed at reducing prison overcrowding			2
however , legal experts said last night that , because of his age and @entity10 ’s lengthy appeals process , it is unlikely that he will spend any time behind bars			2
@entity9 and four others , convicted for their part in what judge @entity25 described as a ‘ significant tax evasion ’ , were also fined ten million euros			1
in addition , the billionaire media tycoon was banned from public office for five years			1
the 76 - year - old billionaire businessman , who was among 11 defendants on trial , is expected to remain free until the appeals process is exhausted			1
in @entity10 , cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts are final			1
the conviction was the media mogul 's first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were thrown out after time ran out to prosecute			2
just last week , he appeared in the same courthouse for another trial in which he is accused of paying for sex with an under - age teenager and then trying to cover it up			1

sentenced : judge @entity53 reads out the sentence today in a decision that capped a trial in which @entity9 was accused of masterminding a scheme to illegally inflate the price paid for television rights but today , the media mogul was n't in the courtroom for the verdict , which comes two days after he announced he will not run in @entity10 's upcoming elections			1
instead , his lawyers denounced the verdict in a statement as ' absolutely incredible '			1
prosecutors allege the defendants were behind a scheme to purchase the rights to broadcast @entity72 movies on @entity9 's private television networks through a series of offshore companies and had falsely declared the payments to avoid taxes			1
prosecutors further alleged the inflated the price for the tv rights of some 3,000 films as they relicensed them internally to @entity9 's networks , pocketing the difference amounting to around € 250million ( £ 200million )			1

the three - time premier stepped down last november after @entity10 came under mounting market pressure to deal with its high debt load and @entity9 failed to come up with persuasive financial reforms			0
@entity9 's designated political heir as the head of the center - right party he leads , @entity113 , blasted the verdict friday as ' incomprehensible ' and said he was confident an appeals court would throw out the conviction			1
@entity9 is not the first former @entity10 premier to be convicted of criminal charges			1
