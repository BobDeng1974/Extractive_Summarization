by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 the @entity3 sheepishly asked thousands of nuns and priests to skip their vespers today after he run behind schedule on a busy day touring @entity8			1
@entity9 had three consecutive meetings in @entity11 , a religious community which cares for disabled people , but by the time he hit the second , he was running out of time			0
' i 've got a little problem , ' he told the crowd of 5,000 nuns and priests who had come to see him give a vespers service in @entity22 and @entity23			1
' thankfully for @entity9 , the crowd erupted in laughter once his apologies in @entity41 were translated into @entity23			1
the @entity3 had already today celebrated a @entity42 before about 800,000 people in @entity44 , during which he beatified 124 @entity23 martyrs			1
he told the hordes of @entity48 who turned out for his open - air @entity42 that their ancestors ' willingness to die rather than renounce their faith two centuries ago was a model for @entity55 missionaries today			1
the streets leading up to @entity44 's iconic @entity57 were packed with @entity58 honoring the lay @entity48 who founded the church here in the 18th century			1
pope @entity9 swings a thurible as he takes part in an open - air mass at @entity64 in @entity44 where beatified 124 early @entity23 martyrs in front of a massive crowd that the @entity68 estimated at 800,000 the streets leading up to @entity44 's iconic @entity57 were packed with hordes of @entity23 catholics honoring the lay @entity48 who founded the church in the country during the 18th century @entity8 's church is unique in that it was founded not by foreign missionary priests - as occurred in most of the world - but by members of @entity8 's own noble classes who learned of @entity79 by reading books about it			1
these early @entity48 were killed in the 18th and 19th centuries by the @entity83 , which tried to shut the @entity84 off from @entity86 influence			0
police in @entity44 declined to give an estimate of the crowd size , but the @entity68 said about 800,000 people had turned out			1
the number was significant given that @entity48 represent only about 10 percent of @entity8 's 50 million people			2
the @entity42 kicked off a busy day for @entity9 as he passed the halfway mark of his five - day @entity8 visit			2
later he travelled to @entity95 and prayed briefly at a monument to aborted babies			0
it was a strong albeit silent gesture from a pope who prefers to stress other aspects of church teaching rather than emphasize hot - button ' culture war ' issues like abortion			2
the @entity42 in @entity44 , though , was one of the highlights of his trip , providing @entity9 with an opportunity to stress how the lessons of @entity8 's early martyrs were relevant today for @entity8 's church , which is small but growing and is seen as a model for the rest of the world			1
' they were willing to make great sacrifices and let themselves be stripped of whatever kept them from christ - possessions and land , prestige and honour - for they knew that @entity123 alone was their true treasure , ' he said			2
' they challenge us to think about what , if anything , we ourselves would be willing to die for			0
' pope @entity9 rides the popemobile , through the crowds towards the @entity57 the numbers who turned out to see the @entity3 were significant given that @entity48 represent only about 10 percent of @entity8 's 50 million people @entity9 praised in particular the fact that laypeople were so crucial to the church 's foundation and growth in @entity8 - a theme he stressed later in the day when he met with leaders of @entity23 lay movements			1
the church is counting on such laymen and laywomen to spread the faith in @entity55 , which the @entity68 considers the future of the church			1
the main reason for @entity9 ' visit to @entity8 , in fact , was to attend an @entity153 youth festival ; the church sees such rallies as a crucial way of inspiring the next generation of @entity48 to evangelise			2
' today as ever , the church needs credible lay witnesses to the saving truth of the @entity159 , ' @entity9 said , stressing in particular the need for their outreach to focus on the poor and most marginalized			2
a collective cheer erupted from the masses when @entity9 declared the 124 ' blessed ' - the first step toward possible sainthood			2
many of the women in the crowd wore lace veils ; others sported paper sun visors with ' @entity173 ' written across them , protecting them from the overcast , hazy skies			0
the scene was impressive , with thousands of people neatly packed into fenced - in sections leading away from the altar , which was set up in front of @entity57 , the south gate to @entity182 palace , with mountains looming above and the presidential @entity184 on the lower slope			0
police in green vests stood guard along the barricades and volunteers handed out water to guard against the warm , humid temperatures			0
a child looks away in terror as the @entity3 strokes her head while riding through the crowds in @entity44 worshippers hold prayer beads as they attend the mass lead by @entity9 at @entity64 ' i 'm so thankful that the pope visited @entity8 , ' said 75 - year - old @entity202 - sang , a @entity153 who was trying to get a glimpse of @entity9 just outside the police barricades			1
' but i 'm so sorry that all the ways to see the pope are blocked			0
i came to hear at least his voice			0
' en route to the altar before @entity42 , @entity9 stopped his open - topped car so he could get out and bless a group of families who lost loved ones in the sinking of the @entity217 ferry in april , in which more than 300 people , most of them high school students , were killed			1
on his white cassock , @entity9 wore a yellow ribbon given to him by the families a day earlier when he met with them privately to try to console them			0
' we want the truth , ' read a yellow banner , a reference to the families ' demands for an independent inquiry into the sinking			0
officials said 400 families had been invited to the @entity42 the main figure in the group that was beatified is @entity235 , who was born in 1759 and was among the earliest catholics on the peninsula			0
he was beheaded in 1791 - the first @entity23 martyr - after he violated the traditional @entity240 funeral rites for his mother			1
in all , the @entity83 killed about 10,000 catholics for refusing to renounce their faith			0
pope @entity9 prays as he arrives at the martyrs ' shrine at @entity246 in @entity44 , the place where in the 18th and 19th century unrepentant @entity48 were publicly executed historians say @entity8 's early believers were struck by the idea of a religion that preached universal equality in divine eyes at a time when the nobility 's discriminatory hierarchical system brutally exploited ordinary people			1
@entity258 canonized another 103 martyrs during a visit to @entity8 in 1984			0
@entity9 began his day by praying at a monument in @entity44 commemorating the martyrs on the site where many of them were killed			1
even non-catholics turned out for the @entity42 , impressed by @entity9 ' humble gestures and call for @entity8 to pay more attention to the poor than their own material gain			0
' i do not know much about @entity48 and @entity8 's @entity153 history , but it seems that the pope is making sure to reach out equally to everyone , ' said @entity274 - sung , 49 , a @entity275 who said @entity9 had inspired her to make changes in her own life			2
' i plan to do volunteering and a lot of sharing so that when i look back at my life 10 years from now , i will think that the pope 's visit motivated me to change , ' @entity274 said .			0
