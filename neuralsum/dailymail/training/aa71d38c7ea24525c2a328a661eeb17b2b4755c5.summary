by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 28 may 2013 on the up : @entity3 party leader @entity2 can expect a strong performance in the @entity6 elections @entity2 's @entity3 is on course for further success in next year 's @entity6 elections , according to the latest poll			1
in the 2014 contest 27 per cent of prospective voters would support @entity3 , with @entity13 on 23 per cent and the @entity14 on 21 per cent			2
the rise of mr @entity2 's party has caused major headaches for the conservatives and this will be the latest challenge from the right for @entity22 to contend with			0
the poll for the @entity24 think tank also found that 39 per cent of those who had voted @entity27 in 2010 would back @entity3 if the @entity6 election were held now			1
in a general election , the poll suggested @entity13 would take 37 per cent of the votes			1
this would give @entity13 an 11 - point lead over the conservatives on 26 per cent , with @entity3 on 20 per cent			2
the @entity35 would be trailing behind on 9 per cent			0
there was some good news for @entity22 though			0
widespread support was clear for his policy of renegotiating the @entity42 's relationship with @entity43 before putting the new settlement to a public vote by the end of 2017			0
if a referendum on @entity42 's membership of the @entity49 were held now , 37 per cent say that they would vote to remain in the @entity49 compared to 41 per cent that say they would vote to leave			1
however , if there was a significant return of powers to @entity56 followed by a referendum , 47 per cent would vote to stay in the @entity49 , while 32 per cent would still vote to leave			2
main parties : @entity3 is a headache for @entity22 , left , as the party is attracting @entity27 voters and for @entity62 , right , as mr @entity2 is only 2 per cent behind him on trust for the new @entity49 negotiations the prime minister was still rated as the party leader most likely to succeed in negotiating a better deal with 29 per cent backing him to win back powers , with @entity62 on 14 per cent , mr @entity2 on 12 per cent and @entity70 on 4 per cent			1
@entity24 's director @entity74 said : ' whilst the @entity34 may be heading for a perfect storm in the @entity49 elections , their overarching goal of a renegotiated position for the @entity42 in the @entity49 still enjoys substantial support from across the political spectrum			1
' most voters would clearly prefer to stay in the @entity49 but on new membership terms , over withdrawing altogether			0
' however , unless a new relationship can be negotiated , the @entity42 electorate could well vote to leave the @entity49 - which should also be a wake - up call for @entity13 and @entity35			2
' trusted : @entity22 , pictured talking to @entity85 president @entity84 , was still voted the favoured party leader to lead @entity49 negotiations on membership ' it 's rather surprising that mr @entity22 , despite everything , is still the most trusted party leader to negotiate a better deal for the @entity42 in @entity6			1
' however , it 's obvious that all parties suffer from a major credibility deficit on @entity49 issues			0
' for this exact reason , mr @entity22 must press ahead with a robust reform agenda now			0
waiting until 2015 will risk losing the public support he still enjoys			0

27 per cent of @entity42 *people* would vote @entity3 in @entity6 elections
in a general election , the poll suggested @entity3 would win 20 per cent
however , @entity22 still most trusted to negotiate new @entity49 membership deal
