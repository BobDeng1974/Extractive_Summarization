it roamed the countryside spreading death and terror – a giant , ferocious hell - hound with flaming eyes and savage claws			1
for centuries , the beast that came to be known as @entity9 struck fear into the hearts of all who crossed its path			1
just a single glimpse was enough to impart a fatal curse ; the briefest encounter sufficient to suck the life from any hapless victim			0
discovery : these remains of a giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of @entity25 in @entity26 is it him ? the bones are believed to date back to the 16th century , when the legendary hell hound @entity9 ( pictured in an artist 's impression ) was rumoured to roam @entity33			1
they show the dog was a ' large male ' one thing , however , has always been absent from the many tales of the dog - like entity and its sinister appearances in the @entity43 flatlands : a single fact			2
now that may be about to change with an answer to the question : did it exist only in folklore ... or was it flesh and blood ? yesterday , 500 years after @entity9 first went on the prowl , archaeologists were examining the skeleton of a 7ft long dog unearthed in the remains of an ancient abbey			1
it was discovered a few miles from two churches where @entity9 is said to have killed worshippers during an almighty thunderstorm in august 1577			2
what ’s more , it appears to have been buried in a shallow grave at precisely the same time as @entity9 is said to have been on the loose , primarily around @entity26 and the @entity33 region			1
site : the bones were uncovered in a 20 - inch deep unmarked grave among the ruins of @entity25 ( pictured ) experts will subject the bones and surrounding material to 21st century dating techniques			1
but first , the legend			0
the beast ’s most celebrated attack began at @entity77 , @entity78			0
a clap of thunder burst open the church doors and a hairy black ‘ devil dog ’ came snarling in			2
it ran through the congregation , killing a man and boy and causing the church steeple to fall through the roof			0
scorch marks still visible on the church doors are purported to have come from @entity9 ’s claws as it fled			2
local verse records the event thus : ‘ all down the church in the midst of fire , the hellish monster flew , and , passing onward to the quire , he many people slew			0
’ next stop was 12 miles away in @entity102 , where two worshippers were killed at @entity105 ’s church			0
one was left shrivelled ‘ like a drawn purse ’ as he prayed			0
@entity108 , projects director of @entity109 , which organised the dig , pictured , said he believed the dog could have lived around 1577 because it was buried alongside pottery fragments from the period ruins : dig ventures projects director , @entity108 , said the grave was dug partly over the foundations of what appeared to have been a kitchen area - indicating it had been created after the abbey fell into disrepair in his 1577 pamphlet @entity123 , the @entity122 told how the @entity126 - like beast came ‘ running all along down the body of the church with great swiftnesse and incredible haste , among the people , in a visible fourm and shape ’ , wringing the necks of two parishioners as they knelt			1
spookily , a later work reveals : ‘ although his howling makes the hearer ’s blood run cold , his footfalls make no sound			0
’ subsequent appearances of @entity9 – a name believed to derive either from an old @entity145 word for demon , or from local dialect meaning ‘ shaggy ’ – have immortalised it			1
an image of @entity9 is incorporated in @entity102 ’s coat of arms , and the nickname for equally legendary @entity153 is the @entity154			1
the bones of the giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of @entity25 in @entity26 the bones uncovered in the ruins of @entity25 , @entity26 , were first found by archaeological group @entity109 in a project last year			1
painstaking work revealed the skeleton of an extremely large dog			0
estimates suggest it would have weighed more than 14 stone and stood 7ft tall on its hind legs			0
the grave was less than 20 inches deep and unmarked			0
pottery fragments found at the same level date from the height of @entity9 ’s alleged reign			1
radio carbon dating tests will now give an exact age for the bones , results that will serve either to enhance the shaggy dog stories – or perhaps to support the far less entertaining theory that here lies a 16th century abbot ’s beloved old hunting dog			1
folklore : the legend of @entity9 is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up across @entity102			1
above , a weather vane in the town according to folklore , @entity9 appeared during a storm on august 4 , 1577 , at @entity191 in @entity78 , about seven miles from @entity25 in @entity26			1
villagers were reportedly sheltering inside the church when a huge clap of thunder caused the doors to burst open and the snarling dog crashed in			0
it ran through the congregation , killing a man and a boy , before the steeple crashed through the roof			0
the dog then fled , leaving scorch marks from its claws on the church door which are still visible today			0
later the same day , @entity9 is said to have struck again 12 miles away , killing two worshippers during a service at @entity210 , @entity102 , while the storm was still raging			2
@entity212 , the @entity122 , is believed to have described the appearance of the legendary hell hound in a pamphlet written in 1577 , entitled ‘ a @entity123 and @entity216 ’			2
he wrote : ' this black dog , or the divel in such a linenesse ( @entity221 hee knoweth al who worketh all , ) running all along down the body of the church with great swiftnesse , and incredible haste , among the people , in a visible fourm and shape , passed between two persons , as they were kneeling uppon their knees , and occupied in prayer as it seemed , wrung the necks of them bothe at one instant clene backward , in somuch that even at a moment where they kneeled , they strangely dyed			2
' historian @entity240 @entity239 also wrote about @entity9 in his 1901 book , @entity242 , set in @entity33			1
' he takes the form of a huge black dog , and prowls along dark lanes and lonesome field footpaths , where , although his howling makes the hearer ’s blood run cold , his footfalls make no sound , ' he wrote			2
the legend of @entity9 is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up in buildings across the town - and the animal is even being incorporated into @entity102 ’s coat of arms			1
there is also a @entity260 and a @entity154 antiques shop , while the nickname for the town 's football club is ' @entity265 '			0
and the legend has even infiltrated popular culture - with @entity269 rock band @entity268 featuring a track inspired by the devil dog on their debut album , @entity272			0
the track , named ' @entity9 ' , includes the lyrics : ' in a town in the east , the parishioners were visited upon by a curious beast			2
' and his eyes numbered but one and shone like the sun , and a glance beckoned the immediate loss of a cherished one			0

according to folklore , @entity9 terrorised @entity33 in 16th century
he towered at seven feet tall , with flaming red eyes and shaggy black hair
now , remains of legendary hound may have been unearthed during a dig
