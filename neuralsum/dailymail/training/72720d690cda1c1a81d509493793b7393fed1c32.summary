@entity0 may come across as the wholesome , down - to - earth outdoorsy type but it seems there 's more to the royal than she lets on			1
the 32 - year - old has revealed that not only has she read racy novel @entity8 - she thought it was tame			1
' oh yes , i read it , ' said the mother - of - one , before adding , slightly sarcastically : ' i thought it was goooood			1
' i think , when i read it i was expecting it to be amazing , ' she continued			1
' [ and then ] it was a bit like , oh , is that it ? ' the royal , who is 15th in line to the throne , was speaking in an interview with the @entity29 to promote @entity30 , a tech company that she fronts			1
despite declaring her intention to put second - time motherhood on hold until after the @entity35 in 2016 , @entity0 happily discussed her penchant for the naughty novel , which has sold millions of copies worldwide			1
she would not , however , reveal whether or not she plans to see the imminent film adaptation of the book , which is scheduled for release in february 2015 talented : @entity0 said she wants to leave having more children until after the @entity43 fit : @entity0 , seen with husband @entity16 , has had a fight on her hands to regain her athletes body after @entity49 's birth @entity50 raised eyebrows over its explicit sex scenes involving bondage instead , the royal 's focus is on her eventing career and she hopes to improve on the team silver achieved at the @entity58			1
she is also working on her fitness which , she says , took a hit following the birth of daughter @entity49 in january this year			1
' after i had my daughter , i was very weak , ' she says			1
' physically weaker but mentally weaker , too			2
everything was n’t 100 per cent			2
i was n’t at my best , i had n’t ever not ridden for that long			2
' i did n’t realise how fit i was before and how many different muscles you use			2
' now back to winning ways , the equestrienne has just over a year to go before the @entity43 commence but has already begun a campaign to impress the @entity71 selectors			0
her most recent attempt came in august when , at the @entity74 in @entity75 , she managed to finish strongly - with a little help from her 13 - year - old horse , @entity78			0
speaking afterwards , she said : ' i was n’t nervous			0
' i knew what i was sat on			0
he ’s just a fantastic horse and he just kept jumping and got me out of trouble			0
' all credit to him , he was in charge really			0
i was just steering and trying to hang on			0
' the 33 - year - old is now hotly tipped for for the @entity35 and has seen her career come on in leaps and bounds since the end of her more rebellious twenties			0
she does , however , still like to do things her own way , not least when she sold pictures of @entity49 to a celebrity magazine for a reported fee of £ 150,000			0
