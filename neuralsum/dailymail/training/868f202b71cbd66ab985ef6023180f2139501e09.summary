@entity0 could be without top scorer @entity1 until february 21 if he is given a three - match ban or more for elbowing @entity4 defender @entity3			1
@entity1 was charged with violent conduct by the @entity6 on monday after @entity8 cameras picked up the striker swinging his elbow in to @entity3 's face on three occasions , connecting at least once			1
a three - match ban would see him ruled out of the @entity15 clash at @entity16 against @entity17 as well as visits to @entity19 in the @entity20 and @entity21 in the @entity22			2
@entity0 forward @entity1 ( circled ) has been charged after elbowing @entity4 's @entity3 @entity3 confronts @entity1 after the incident which knocked him to the floor @entity17 ( @entity26 ) , jan 1 - @entity22 @entity19 ( a ) , jan 3 - @entity20 @entity21 ( a ) , jan 10 - @entity22 @entity27 ( @entity26 ) , jan 17 - @entity22 @entity28 ( a ) , jan 31 - @entity22 @entity29 ( @entity26 ) , feb 8 - @entity22 @entity30 ( a ) , feb 11 - @entity22 @entity1 has until 6pm on tuesday to respond to the charge and if , as expected , he is banned he could miss @entity0 's next seven matches as he is due to fly out to @entity33 with @entity34 for the @entity35 next month			1
@entity35 runs from january 17 until february 8 , meaning @entity1 will miss @entity0 's home fixture against @entity27 on january 17 and their trip to @entity28 on january 31			2
should much - fancied @entity34 progress to the latter stages then @entity1 will also miss the @entity16 clash against @entity29 on february 8 and probably the trip to @entity30 on february 11			0
with the club set to lose manager @entity44 to @entity30 , @entity1 's unavailability is a blow they can not afford			0
the forward scored his ninth of the season in the 3 - 2 win over @entity4 on sunday but his elbow on @entity3 looks like it will have more significance than that strike come the end of the season			0
@entity1 celebrates with @entity55 after he scored in @entity0 's 3 - 2 win on sunday			0
