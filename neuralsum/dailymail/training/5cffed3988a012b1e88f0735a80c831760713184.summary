a @entity1 academic has unearthed evidence showing former @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 once discussed a coup with disgruntled @entity6 to overthrow the @entity1 government in the 1970s			1
@entity3 and @entity8 were aggrieved at the left - leaning government of the day 's burgeoning friendship with the hardline @entity12 government			1
@entity3 became the contact man for a secret spy network made up of old nazis and elite aristocrats aimed at torpedoing the plans formulated by chancellor @entity18			1
secret : @entity3 in the 1970s in his @entity21 office in @entity22			0
he gave advice to a secret network made up of old nazis and elite aristocrats by the end of 1970 , @entity3 was offering the spies advice on how to deal with @entity18 's social democratic government			1
the group he became embroiled with was called ' @entity30 ' and was formed by the conservative @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , which was allied with @entity33 's @entity32			1
one agent who visited @entity3 quoted him saying , ' it might be possible to overthrow the current government , but it remains to be seen whether this would involve risks which could put a @entity31 ( @entity31 ) / @entity32 ( @entity32 ) government in great difficulty			1
@entity41 , the architect of the disastrous secret bombing of @entity43 in the @entity44 which paved the way for the @entity47 regime and its hideous genocide programme , approved of the plan to usurp the elected government of the day is unclear			2
revealed : @entity3 even discussed the possibility of a coup to overthrow the government of chancellor @entity18 the group he became embroiled with was called ' @entity30 ' and was formed by the conservative @entity31 party			1
@entity18 pursued a policy of engagement with the @entity12 , convinced it was better to build bridges with the dictatorship to defuse @entity62 tensions rather than always being at loggerheads			1
for the all - white , all male conservatives of the @entity31 , this was too much			0
they wanted @entity1 to face off against the @entity69 - backed regime in the belief that isolation would make it crumble			0
it was out of this belief that its private spy organisation , made up of many former @entity76 and @entity77 men as well as titled barons and counts , was formed			1
political scientist @entity80 spent seven years researching letters from politicians from the @entity31 and its @entity33 sister party the @entity32 , and her results are to be published next year ; potentially embarrassing timing for chancellor @entity87 who in november 2013 will seek re-election as @entity31 chancellor for the third time			2
@entity80 approached @entity3 for comment but he refused , as did many of the noblemen who worked for the @entity30 which came into being in 1969 after the party lost its first general election since the postwar republic was formed in 1949			1
details of her research are published in the current edition of the @entity1 intellectual weekly @entity102			0
the catalyst for the spy group was @entity18 's decision to recognise @entity107 borders dividing @entity1 and a pledge @entity18 gave that his state would not use violence against the @entity112 one in the east			1
conservative mp @entity114 , who was the grandfather of the disgraced former defence minister who had to resign last year after it was discovered he cheated on his doctorate , held a meeting in the autumn of 1969 with former chancellor @entity120 and leading @entity31 and @entity32 politicians , the @entity32 being the @entity33 wing of the party			2
' they decided to form an information service for the opposition , ' said @entity80			0
' it was a secret spy service			0
' beliefs : the @entity130 wall			0
the catalyst was @entity18 's decision to recognise @entity107 borders dividing @entity1 and a pledge @entity18 gave that his state would not use violence against the @entity112 one in the east the former head of the @entity139 , @entity1 's domestic intelligence agency , was tapped and he offered up a ready - made web of informants across the globe in countries as far apart as the @entity4 , @entity145 and @entity146			1
@entity147 , the cousin of the man who tried and failed to kill @entity149 in the july 1944 bomb plot , was chosen to head the network			0
@entity152 of @entity153 , who would later only narrowly miss imprisonment for the @entity31 's party donation scandal of a decade ago , was recruited to raise the hundreds of thousands of d - marks necessary to fund the network			0
he collected from conservatives in industry , many of whom had previously supported @entity149 , and who now viewed with suspicion the apparent coziness developing between @entity18 and the @entity112			2
the first act was to open a secret ' back channel ' to @entity3 who was keen to know what the @entity69 were up to at all times , including their puppets in @entity130			0
the treasurer of the group was @entity172 , a former @entity173 who acted as the chief defence lawyer for @entity149 deputy @entity176			0
' in 1971 @entity18 was talking about the administration of @entity130 with @entity178 in @entity179 and @entity147 â€™s informants were delivering secret information to the conservatives who were discussing it with @entity3 , ' said @entity80			2
the intelligence gleaned came from eavesdropping , intercepted mail , informers and telephone taps			0
the @entity30 ran for a decade , lavishly funded and with probably more success than the state intelligence agencies which were riddled with @entity12 moles			1
it was @entity193 , who came to power in 1982 , who disbanded the network			0
it was @entity193 who promoted @entity87 - who grew up in @entity12 - to become the party leader : now she will have serious political bullets to dodge about her party 's murky past before polling day next year			2
it was @entity193 , left , who came to power in 1982 , who disbanded the network - it was him who promoted @entity87 , right , to become the party leader			0

' the @entity30 ' was made up of many former @entity76 and @entity77 men as well as titled barons and counts
@entity211 even discussed with them the possibility of a coup to overthrow the government of chancellor @entity18
the @entity30 which came into being in 1969 and ran for a decade
was lavishly funded and with more success than state intelligence agencies which were riddled with @entity12 moles
