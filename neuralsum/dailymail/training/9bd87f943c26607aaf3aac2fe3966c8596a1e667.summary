@entity1 researchers have uncovered a previously unknown , and possibly substantial , source of the greenhouse gas methane to the @entity5 's atmosphere			1
after testing a sample of abandoned oil and natural gas wells in northwestern @entity10 , the researchers found that many of the old wells leaked substantial quantities of methane			1
because there are so many abandoned wells nationwide - about three million - the researchers believe the overall contribution of leaking wells could be significant			1
researchers at @entity1 say abandoned wells in @entity10 are emitting natural gas			1
and as many as three million nationwide could be leaking			1
pictured is one of the wells the researchers tested , this one in the @entity26 the researchers said their findings identify a need to make measurements across a wide variety of regions in @entity10 but also in other states with a long history of oil and gas development such as @entity36 and @entity37			1
' the research indicates that this is a source of methane that should not be ignored , ' said dr @entity40 , the @entity42 professor of environmental studies and professor of civil and environmental engineering at @entity1			2
' we need to determine how significant it is on a wider basis			0
' while oil and gas companies work to minimise the amount of methane emitted by their operations , almost no attention has been paid to wells that were drilled decades ago			1
these wells , some of which date back to the 19th century , are typically abandoned and not recorded on official records			0
methane is the unprocessed form of natural gas			1
scientists say that after carbon dioxide , methane is the most important contributor to the greenhouse effect , in which gases in the atmosphere trap heat that would otherwise radiate from the @entity5			0
@entity71 , methane has about 20 times the heat - trapping effect as carbon dioxide			0
methane is produced naturally , by processes including decomposition , and by human activity such as landfills and oil and gas production			2
dr @entity80 , then a doctoral candidate at @entity1 , originally began looking into methane emissions from old wells after researching techniques to store carbon dioxide by injecting it deep underground			1
while examining ways that carbon dioxide could escape underground storage , dr @entity88 wondered about the effect of old wells on methane emissions			2
' i was looking for data , but it did n't exist , ' said dr @entity88 , now a postdoctoral researcher at @entity97			0
in a paper published 8 dec in the @entity100 , the researchers describe how they chose 19 wells in the adjacent @entity103 and @entity104 counties in northwestern @entity10			2
the wells chosen were all abandoned , and records about the origin of the wells and their conditions did not exist			0
only one of the wells was on the state 's list of abandoned wells			2
some of the wells , which can look like a pipe emerging from the ground , are located in forests and others in people 's yards			0
dr @entity88 said the lack of documentation made it hard to tell when the wells were originally drilled or whether any attempt had been made to plug them			0
' what surprised me was that every well we measured had some methane coming out , ' said dr @entity132			0
other states like @entity36 and @entity37 may have similar emissions , according to the study			1
abandoned wells could represent as much as 10 per cent of methane from human activities in @entity10			1
and , unlike working wells , they can leak methane for decades			1
shown is a fracking operation in @entity143 to conduct the research , the team placed enclosures called flux chambers over the tops of the wells			0
they also placed flux chambers nearby to measure the background emissions from the terrain and make sure the methane was emitted from the wells and not the surrounding area			2
although all the wells registered some level of methane , about 15 per cent emitted the gas at a markedly higher level - thousands of times greater than the lower - level wells			2
dr @entity163 , a @entity1 professor and a member of the research team , said a critical task is to discover the characteristics of these super-emitting wells			0
@entity163 said the relatively low number of high - emitting wells could offer a workable solution : while trying to plug every abandoned well in the country might be too costly to be realistic , dealing with the smaller number of high emitters could be possible			0
' the fact that most of the methane is coming out of a small number of wells should make it easier to address if we can identify the high - emitting wells , ' said dr @entity163			0
the researchers have used their results to extrapolate total methane emissions from abandoned wells in @entity10 , although they stress that the results are preliminary because of the relatively small sample			1
but based on that data , they estimate that emissions from abandoned wells represents as much as 10 per cent of methane from human activities in @entity10 - about the same amount as caused by current oil and gas production			1
also , unlike working wells , which have productive lifetimes of 10 to 15 years , abandoned wells can continue to leak methane for decades			1
' this may be a significant source , ' @entity163 said			0
' there is no single silver bullet but if it turns out that we can cap or capture the methane coming off these really big emitters , that would make a substantial difference			0
' the @entity207 is currently mulling whether to issue mandatory standards for reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as part of president @entity213 's broad climate action plan .			0
