two of @entity2 's top clubs are in crisis as @entity4 fell to a 1 - 0 loss at @entity6 and @entity7 could only manage a 2 - 2 draw with @entity9			1
the results leave @entity12 's men top , but just two points ahead of a @entity15 side who have a game in hand , while @entity19 's @entity7 are 10th in @entity20 with just eight wins in their 26 league matches			1
the sunday papers in @entity24 and @entity25 have not held back in their criticism of the teams , with @entity29 's headline reading : ' no future for @entity19 '			1
in @entity24 , ' freefall ' is the headline in @entity33			0
' no future for @entity19 ' reads the headline in sunday 's @entity29 after @entity7 drew 2 - 2 with @entity9 @entity7 have struggled for the entirety of this season , and @entity19 himself was coy about his future after the match			1
@entity29 carry a quote from the former @entity7 player : ' will i stay ? i 'm not the one to ask , ' while @entity46 quote @entity19 as saying : ' we gave away a goal like fools			2
i go forward with my head held high			0
' @entity51 was the scorer of @entity9 's all - important equaliser , in the 95th minute of the match			2
as @entity46 point out , he was the man who scored the goal against @entity55 that led to the sacking of @entity57 in 2014			0
there is crisis at two of @entity2 's biggest clubs as both @entity7 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) failed to win over in @entity24 , @entity33 claim @entity4 lacked ideas and character as they collapsed at @entity64			1
despite being top of the league , there are high expectations from fans of @entity4 , and the 1 - 0 loss to @entity6 was far from good enough			1
@entity71 scored the only goal of the game to ' turn @entity74 upside down ' , and @entity12 said post-match , ' it 's quite confusing what we are doing in attack			0
' ' there it goes ! ' reads the headline in sunday 's as , and they claim @entity15 will ' go out like a motorbike against @entity87 ' , whom they play on sunday lunchtime			0
@entity15 can go top of @entity74 if they win their game in hand against @entity87 on sunday lunchtime @entity15 can go top of @entity74 for the first time in 16 games with a win , and should that happen @entity12 will have a real problem on his hands			2
@entity98 carry a quote from @entity15 superstar @entity100 , who left a message for his fans on his @entity104 page on saturday night			0
if they were n't already aware of the magnitude of their game , @entity100 's message ' we ca n't fail ' will have certainly left no doubt in their minds .			0

@entity4 lost 1 - 0 to @entity6 and @entity7 drew 2 - 2 with @entity9
@entity4 's result leaves @entity15 with a chance to go top of @entity74
@entity19 's @entity7 job is in *danger* after they stayed 10th in @entity20
@entity33 claim @entity4 are in ' freefall ' , while @entity29 claim there is ' no future for @entity19 ' at @entity7
