@entity0 has confirmed he wants @entity1 back at @entity2			1
the @entity4 manager has recruited @entity5 as his new star striker , but he sees @entity1 as a valuable member of his squad going into the new campaign			1
‘ we think about it , ’ said @entity0 of @entity1			1
‘ we want to win matches and win titles and @entity1 is one of the best strikers in @entity15			1
‘ if you bring him back it is not because he is @entity1 or scored the most important goal in the history of @entity4 , or because i read i need an assistant , no. ‘ if i bring him back , and the decision has to be made soon , it is because as a player he has qualities to make the team stronger			1
the team is not about the eleven			0
it is about the different options and as an option i would not say no about the possibility			0
’ leader : @entity0 ( right ) struck up a brilliant relationship with the @entity4 legend @entity41 wants @entity1 return @entity0 might insist any decision to bring back @entity1 will be non-emotional but he does recognise the 36 - year - old ‘ belongs ’ to @entity4			1
‘ with @entity1 ’s profile , being a squad player i think could be important for any team , ’ he said			1
‘ and because we know his heart is pushing him to where he feels he belongs , and because our boss ( owner @entity47 ) has this big feeling towards him , we are thinking about the possibility			0
mr @entity47 is very intelligent and he feels that people belong to the club			0
we feel that @entity1 belongs to us			1
is he coming back as a player one more year or a couple more years ? let ’s see			1
’ @entity0 likens @entity1 to @entity59 , who was unveiled at @entity60 on thursday			1
he said : ‘ the way mr @entity47 approached the @entity59 situation is amazing : “ you go if you want to go ; you come back if you want to come back			2
and you come back the way you want — to be an assistant , to be an ambassador , to be a director , to be a coach , to be an assistant coach ”			2
’ meanwhile , @entity0 faces a delicate balancing act as he tries to keep two world - class goalkeepers happy this season			2
@entity75 : 168 goals in six seasons at @entity78			0
had a year in @entity79 and hit 182 upon his return			0
@entity81 : 47 @entity83 goals before moves to @entity85 and @entity86			0
115 goals in his second spell			0

@entity96 : returned to @entity92 in 2001 after four seasons at @entity98 and hit another 26 goals			0
@entity100 : club legend went back to @entity102 on loan and scored on his debut			2

but it was not long before the talk turned to the imminent arrival of @entity124 , the 22 - year - old who has starred for @entity125 — and is 10 years his junior			1
‘ i do n’t want to sit on the bench , ’ said @entity117			2
‘ i always give my best and obviously that is all i can do			0
i will do my best and do everything i can do to be as ready as possible for when the season starts			2
@entity0 will make his choice and decide how his team is going to look for the first game , second game , third game , whatever game			2
safe hands : @entity117 was delighted to get his first 90 minutes of football after dislocating his shoulder last season competition : @entity124 will return to @entity4 and battle for the no 1 shirt ‘ it is up to us players to show we are ready to play and make him pick us			1
i am doing everything i can to make him pick me			0
’ right now @entity117 is simply pleased to be back in shape			1
‘ it ’s great to be back , ’ he said			2
he deserves credit given it was said he would not return from his injury until september			0
‘ i spent the days at @entity151 , ’ he said			0
‘ i did as much as i could			0
if you keep working , you push the boundaries to the limit			0
