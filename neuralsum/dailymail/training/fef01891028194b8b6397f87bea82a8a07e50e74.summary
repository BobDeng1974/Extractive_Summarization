by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 19:57 est , 9 march 2014 at an hour on sunday when civilised people are untopping the sherry decanter after @entity4 , that spongy - wet curate @entity5 stepped in front of a gathering in @entity8			1
‘ rally ’ was not quite the word			2
sunday school was more the level			2
the modernist @entity13 offered the deputy prime minister a smallish space			2
@entity16 has it that his @entity19 office may be bigger than this venue			2
deputy prime minister @entity5 used his speech to his party conference in @entity8 to insist he loves @entity24 the back wall was tinged orange , although the faces of his worried , earnest audience were closer to car - sick green			1
lucky devils , they had been given a warm - up speech by @entity33 mp			1
the slogan ‘ @entity35 ’ decorated the scenery flats behind mr @entity5			1
did they mean ‘ @entity38 ’ ? it may make sense as a @entity42 hashtag ( whatever that might be ) but as a conference - platform motto it jolted the eye			2
since last autumn , mr @entity5 has been describing the @entity46 as ‘ the party of in ’ , in reference to his party ’s @entity50 stance			1
it only ever reminds me of @entity54 and ‘ the knights who say @entity56 ’			0
‘ since i became deputy prime minister , ’ he began , just to make sure that we realised this was all about him			0
mr @entity5 said the @entity46 must remain in government after the next election to ensure that @entity24 is not dragged backwards by the @entity62 or @entity63 he described how he had been round the world , representing us			1
the @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 : all these places had been visited by our hero			0
i am sure they were amazed			0
‘ i love @entity24 , ’ he said			1
brace yourselves , team – patriotic guff incoming			0
‘ i love it for all its contradictions			2
i love that we are as modest as we are proud			2
i love that we insist on queuing when we go abroad , even when the locals do n’t			2
‘ i love @entity84 telling me that the feeling of freedom you get in @entity24 simply does n’t exist anywhere else			1
’ the castanet clacker , since you ask , was not in attendance			0
mr @entity5 has never been the most inventive orator			1
@entity92 has done this sort of ‘ i love @entity24 ’ spiel			1
@entity95 did it when he played a pm on screen			0
me - too @entity99 was late to the game			0
he loved the shipping forecast , @entity102 , the @entity103 , the @entity104			2
eh ? are we sure about that last one ? best of @entity24 ? a pair of flip - flips , one of the items on a list of things @entity5 likes about the @entity24 one of his grandfathers stood on the roof of @entity114 at the end of the @entity116 and watched the troops returning from the @entity118			1
‘ he passionately believed that to be a @entity24 soldier , defending our values of liberty and peace was the most noble thing you could be , ’ said the @entity119			1
‘ @entity127 , funny , compassionate @entity24 , ’ said the half - @entity126			1
following which , he segued into a passage about the rise of ‘ extremist parties ’ in @entity132 : @entity134 ’s @entity133 , @entity136 ’s @entity135 , @entity138 ’s @entity137 party			0
all that stood between us and these parties of @entity143 barbarianism was @entity144			0
one fairly reliable rule of politics is that the truth is the opposite of what a party leader says in speeches to conferences			0
in a speech in @entity8 mr @entity5 listed what he likes about modern @entity24 thus , when mr @entity5 said yesterday that ‘ the @entity46 are now @entity24 ’s only party of in ’ , he was in fact talking baloney			1
the @entity62 , though sceptical , still currently think we should be in the @entity159 ( although they would give us a referendum )			0
the @entity161 are @entity50 , big time			0
so the @entity46 are by no means the ‘ only party of in ’			0
mr @entity5 , attacking @entity163 , deplored ‘ stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism ’			1
but the radicalism of those who would give the voters a referendum on @entity132 is surely not ‘ stuffy ’			0
is it not more drearily establishment to want to leave the @entity159 as it is ? mr @entity5 knocked the ‘ ungenerous , backwards - looking politics ’ of @entity163			1
yet is it not ‘ backwards ’ to resist any thought of greater national liberty ? someone he does n't like : mr @entity5 took aim at rivals , including @entity179 leader @entity178 ( pictured ) as the pint - drinking , smiling face of an ' ungenerous , backwards - looking politics ' and hang on			1
why attack @entity179 ? they are the best bet that the @entity184 has of beating the @entity62			0
@entity5 should be loving @entity179 ! he ended by throwing out a few words : ‘ the future not the past			1
’ such platitudes are uttered by the leaders of political parties everywhere – possibly even @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 or @entity70			0
as a slogan they were no more convincing than ‘ @entity35 ’			0

@entity5 performed his speech to a crowd in the @entity199 , @entity8
he spoke of his ' love ' for @entity24 , and went on to list things that he loved
*argued* that ' @entity163 ' was not the way forward for @entity24
