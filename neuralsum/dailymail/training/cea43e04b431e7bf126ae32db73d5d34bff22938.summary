the celebrated class of ’ 92 , some of whom are destined to take charge of leading football clubs , have rubber - stamped their first managerial sacking as co-owners of non-league @entity7			1
the @entity10 quintet of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 and @entity15 endorsed the @entity18 management ’s decision to part company with assistant @entity20			1
@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 and @entity15 are co-owners of @entity7 former @entity10 stars @entity13 , @entity12 , @entity22 and @entity11 have ambitious plans for @entity7 popular former @entity18 player @entity20 had caused the club embarrassment by sending @entity27 side @entity26 winger @entity28 a text inquiring about his availability and telling him @entity12 rated him			1
@entity18 , very aware of the need to conduct all their business correctly because of the scrutiny the @entity0 of ’ 92 attracts , saw that the @entity20 text could be considered an illegal approach — especially as it was made public on @entity37			1
added to that was the use of @entity12 ’s name when the former midfielder has never seen @entity28 play			1
@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and and the @entity43 were part of the class of ' 92 at @entity10 @entity20 is understood to be upset at the way he was dismissed by chairwoman @entity47 this week without being given a reason shortly after being asked to sign a confidentiality agreement			1
@entity18 have announced @entity20 ’s departure as part of a ‘ reshuffle ’			1
the reasons why 2014 fa cup final referee @entity54 ( above ) has not taken charge of a game since the @entity59 showcase is another example of the chronic lack of transparency surrounding the @entity63 all they say is @entity54 is injured but will not reveal any more detail apart from him being due back on the elite referee match - list by the end of this month			2
the @entity69 , whose ridiculous extravagance was highlighted by the £ 640,000 annual package paid to @entity73 , do n’t seem to have learned anything since low - key @entity76 @entity75 took the helm			2
new communications and marketing director @entity78 has decided he needs more help in promoting tennis so the @entity69 have promptly chucked another £ 200,000 a year at four more pr jobs described as ‘ new unique roles ’			0
@entity84 will follow launching @entity85 by being the official @entity87 coin tosser on sunday @entity88 mayor @entity84 will no doubt revel in being the official @entity87 coin tosser on sunday			0
the toss before a regular - season game has been done by the referee since 1921			0
but @entity84 is conducting the ceremony before the @entity95 - @entity94 game at @entity59			0
blame the topsoil , @entity97 the @entity98 are blaming the poor state of their @entity59 pitch on too much topsoil being applied in the summer — rather than the american football games which have upset @entity104 manager @entity103			0
it ’s seen by the @entity98 as a technical problem that can be resolved , with the surface back in pristine condition before two @entity110 games and three @entity87 matches next autumn provide another big test			0
@entity95 take on @entity112 at @entity59 just days before @entity104 's @entity113 qualifier meanwhile , it has caused considerable surprise within the @entity87 that @entity103 should be so negative about @entity117 at @entity59 when @entity98 general secretary @entity118 had so recently described bringing an @entity87 franchise to the national stadium as a priority			2
there can be no complaints for a change about @entity104 teams failing to utilise their £ 100million @entity127 training facility during the upcoming international week			0
seven @entity104 sides — seniors , under 21 , @entity128 , @entity129 , women , cerebral palsy and blind — will be in residence and all will be respecting the 11am two - minute @entity136 silence on tuesday			0
a panel including @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 decided in their wisdom that the wholly unnecessary football business awards ’ ‘ outstanding contribution ’ should go to former @entity10 and @entity145 chief executive @entity144 ( above ) , who is now running football funds involved in third - party ownership outlawed in @entity104 football			1
junior rugby outfit @entity150 hold more @entity153 debenture seats than any club apart from @entity155 and @entity156			2
@entity150 ’s savvy move was helped by club member and @entity160 grandee @entity159 having devised the terms and conditions of @entity153 ticketing policy during his years on the ticketing committee , when he did everything by the book			2
dance now occupies the best seat in the house as president of the @entity160 .			0
