@entity1 rugby fans are not , as a rule , the kind of folk who fling @entity7 bars at directors ’ boxes or strike up furious chants demanding a change of leadership			1
it takes something hugely infuriating to prompt them out of their beery reverie and happily soused sense of match - day bonhomie , a state of mind where every stranger is regarded as just a friend they have n’t met , and where the pain of loss is tempered by the knowledge that their new best pals are enjoying victory			2
the actions of one poor demented soul at @entity32 on saturday evening offered a brief and revelatory glimpse , then , of how deeply the national mood has darkened at the end of an emotionally exhausting @entity36 , a campaign that moved from promising to properly poor without bothering to shift through the gears			1
@entity1 's dismal @entity36 campaign ended with a 40 - 10 thrashing by @entity41 at @entity32 @entity1 's huge loss on saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table @entity1 's @entity47 is tackled by @entity48 and @entity49 during their @entity36 rugby match storming up the steps at the back of the main stand with about five minutes to go , @entity51 from @entity52 whistled sharply for the attention of @entity57 and his coaching team , safely ensconced behind reinforced glass in their secure box			1
satisfied that he had caught their eye , the furious fan — a sensible enough looking chap — pointed and roared about the ‘ disgrace ’ and ‘ joke ’ of a performance he had been watching all afternoon			0
give that man a hand			0
or a blog on the @entity75 website , at least			0
none of the home fans among the 67,000 sell - out enjoyed seeing their team reduced to mere fodder — an absolute irrelevance — by an @entity41 side involved in a run chase , a mathematical exercise in points accumulation			1
considering the paucity of the @entity1 performance , devoid of spark and littered with the kind of basic errors that would move a mini-rugby coach to break down in tears , the sound of patience snapping all over the stadium could hardly have come as a surprise to anyone			1
still , at least the @entity99 had a right good day out , with head coach @entity100 making a point of mentioning how welcoming the home crowd had been to his boys			0
@entity32 , eh ? available for conferences , weddings , bar mitzvahs and even title celebrations — complete with fireworks — by anyone but the regular residents			0
@entity111 of @entity41 scores the second try in the @entity36 match between @entity1 and @entity41 @entity41 players celebrate at the end of the match at @entity32 before being crowned @entity36 champions @entity41 's @entity111 and @entity118 escape @entity1 's @entity119 during the @entity36 match at @entity32 if everyone involved in the @entity1 set - up , from the kit man to self - styled comedy guru and full - time director of rugby @entity127 , did n’t feel at least a little uncomfortable watching the @entity99 party on saturday night , something is very wrong			1
our home ground certainly lacks the intimidation factor that comes with a winning team , the best we can offer being a @entity134 lookalike wandering on to the field with a claymore and a monkey , with a microphone , yelling at people to support the team — or even giggling to himself as he makes his one joke about @entity143 ’ beard again and again and again			0
given the situation , @entity41 — ranked third in the world and chasing a second successive @entity36 title — were never going to flinch from the task in hand			1
they ran in four tries , forced @entity1 to concede a dirty dozen penalties , won every contest that mattered … and genuinely seemed capable of taking the ball back from @entity1 any time they damn well pleased			1
the visitors won a dozen turnovers and , if some of those were the result of excellent work in the breakdown , most were about the @entity162 simply dropping the ball , knocking it on , losing it when hanging on might , just might , have given them a chance of avoiding a 30 - point demolition			2
sure , @entity47 scored a nice enough try for the home team , finishing with a bit of cheek for good measure			0
but dear oh dear , the majority of the fare served up was miserably thin			0
@entity57 ( centre ) has his position as @entity1 head coach under scrutiny after a winless @entity36 @entity47 ( right ) touches down for a @entity1 try in the defeat against @entity41 on saturday @entity1 were outclassed by @entity41 at @entity32 as the visitors secured the @entity36 title take the passage of play leading up to @entity41 ’s third try as perhaps the ideal snapshot of the entire afternoon			1
it all started with a brilliant @entity185 take on a high ball plummeting to earth inside the @entity99 half , the @entity1 winger collecting and driving forward			1
when @entity192 ’s low pass in front of @entity119 was knocked on by the stooping big man , though , it handed @entity41 a scrum on halfway			1
a scrum that they converted into a penalty by simply pulverising the @entity162 eight			0
a kick to touch , a line - out cleanly taken , an efficient working of the ball through the phases — and bang , @entity206 scores under the posts			2
errors like that , of which there were far too many to document on saturday , have left @entity57 banging on about the same problems that confronted him on day one of his reign			1
he still talks with some degree of animation , by his standards , about possession , grabbing hold of teams and shaking them until they hurt , treating every second in every game as a moment of truth			0
already he is looking forward to a long training camp ahead of the @entity226 , promising that working and drilling them , going back to basics and forcing them to confront their own shortcomings will bear dividends			1
important players , leaders , will return from injury			0
we will duly skelp @entity237 and beat the @entity238 in our opening two @entity226 games , raising hopes just in time for the crucial group fixtures against @entity243 and @entity244			1
if that is the limit of our ambitions , grand			0
if we are content to be bumping along the bottom of the @entity36 table , occasionally rousing ourselves for the odd @entity251 test against undercooked southern hemisphere opposition , carry on			2
@entity57 obviously hopes to achieve more than that in his time as @entity1 head coach			1
but he ca n’t do it alone			0
given the lack of strength in depth , even his most promising players must , absolutely must , take personal responsibility for carrying themselves and their team - mates to at least the middle ground of international respectability			2
@entity47 , celebrating his very first professional try a year into his career , said : ‘ @entity57 keeps talking about detail			2
we need to improve as individuals , as well as improving as a team			0
@entity47 backed coach @entity57 to inspire @entity1 to turn their form around with the @entity226 coming @entity48 ( second right ) makes a break for @entity41 during the @entity36 game against @entity1 @entity119 ( centre ) of @entity1 wins a line out ball during the @entity36 match against @entity41 ‘ it ’s up to individual players to go away to their clubs and work on these things			1
then we should come back for pre-season , hopefully , with all the players tweaking things and returning as better rugby players			0
‘ because we do know that we need to step up again for the @entity226			2
personally , as a playmaker , i have to take a lot out of this campaign and look at what i can do better			0
we will go to the @entity226 as a better team			2
’ as promises go , it ’s not quite up there with a dazed @entity300 seemingly suggesting that @entity1 might contend for the @entity301 half a year down the line			2
right now , we would settle for performances that keep the fans at bar ’s length from open revolt — and the @entity7 bars tucked firmly in place between the hip flask and the tartan tammy .			0
