@entity0 had mixed success in their latest pre season outing - a @entity4 pre season tournament in memory of the @entity8 mining disaster - beating @entity6 but losing late on to @entity9 in two 45 - minute matches			1
@entity11 started both games and the £ 32million hitman scored a brilliant goal against @entity6 , beating four defenders to open the scoring before @entity17 added a second			2
a defeat to @entity9 through @entity21 's late goal denied them the title though as @entity9 came out on top			0
@entity25 returners @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 all made their first appearances of pre season as @entity33 's side went back to winning ways after a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity36			1
former @entity0 striker @entity50 was denied by @entity51 before @entity21 netted from the subsequent corner to condemn @entity0 to defeat			0
@entity54 came closest for the @entity55 , seeing a decent free kick effort knocked away by @entity57 in the @entity9 goal			0
@entity59 : @entity21 tucked home the winner late on for @entity9 to condemn @entity0 to defeat familiar sight : @entity54 goes down under a challenge from @entity21 earlier in the game in @entity4 catch me if you can : @entity67 gets away from a pair of @entity70 defenders on friday night competitive : @entity72 @entity9 : @entity57 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82			1
@entity0 : @entity51 , @entity17 , @entity84 , @entity72 , @entity38 , @entity85 ( @entity86 44 ) , @entity37 ( @entity87 36 ) , @entity29 ( @entity88 44 ) , @entity67 ( @entity27 23 ) , @entity28 , @entity11 ( @entity54 23 )			1
@entity51 will have been disappointed for his part in the decisive goal - getting caught in no - mans land and being blocked off at the corner - allowing @entity21 to stick the ball into the empty net			0
before that @entity94 got away from @entity17 and @entity84 before @entity51 tipped his shot wide			0
in a game of few chances @entity11 saw an early shot saved but @entity0 did n't create enough to merit the win leaving captain @entity72 to make the trophy presentation to their victorious @entity70 opponents			2
reasons to be cheerful : @entity33 seemed in a better mood than after @entity0 's 3 - 0 defeat in @entity36 boys from @entity107 : @entity28 made his return from the @entity25 and took on @entity80 here disappointment : @entity27 looks gutted as the @entity9 players celebrate winning the pre season tournament @entity44 - fenerbahce 0 - 2 @entity0 @entity11 scored a brilliant goal to set @entity0 on their way to a win over @entity6 in a 45 - minute @entity4 friendly as the @entity55 ' £ 32million hitman continued his fine pre season form			1
@entity17 doubled the lead with a follow - up to @entity26 's free kick as @entity33 's side took an early lead in the pre season tournament arranged to help the families of victims in the @entity8 mining disaster			1
and @entity51 took a step ahead of @entity126 in the battle to be @entity0 's no 1 , making a smart save and keeping a clean sheet - albeit for just a half - as his young @entity132 rival missed out through injury			0
impressive : @entity11 opened the scoring with a brilliant goal against @entity6 see you later : the @entity138 striker evaded the challenges of four defenders to score in @entity4 blue boys : @entity37 jumps on top of @entity11 as his team mates congratulate him on the opener @entity6 : @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155			0
@entity0 : @entity51 , @entity17 , @entity84 , @entity72 , @entity156 , @entity37 ( @entity86 39 ) , @entity85 , @entity26 ( @entity29 33 ) , @entity27 , @entity67 ( @entity87 41 ) , @entity11 ( @entity54 35 )			1
goals : costa 24 , @entity17 31			0
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity29 all made their first appearances of pre season but @entity11 played the starring role as he warmed up to spearhead the @entity55 ' @entity162 title bid			1
moving from a position on the left wing the @entity138 centre forward turned one defender before escaped the attentions of three more before smartly finishing past @entity145 after 24 minutes			0
and @entity17 made it 2 - 0 later in the half , latching on to @entity145 's parry from @entity26 's dead ball attempt			2
@entity27 earlier had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside after latching onto @entity67 's through ball while @entity11 was lucky to avoid injury when @entity150 jumped in for a two - footed challenge but was only booked			2
@entity126 was missing from the @entity55 squad after picking up a minor injury problem			0
easy does it : @entity72 congratulates @entity17 on his goal which doubled @entity0 's lead finish touch : @entity17 knocks home the rebound past @entity145 to secure the win against @entity6 back in action : @entity107 midfielder @entity27 made his return to the side after playing at the @entity25 step up : @entity67 got 41 minutes in his first start of @entity0 's pre season campaign in @entity70 getting there : @entity0 have just 10 days left until their @entity162 season opener at @entity193 here we go again : @entity26 was also back in the team and set up @entity17 's goal			1
