by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 7 may 2013 a bulldog puppy has been saved from nonstop agony by being taken for walkies underwater			2
@entity4 was so crippled when he was handed over to vets that he was close to being put down , but has now been nursed back to health and can move around again			1
the dog was rescued from an apparently abusive owner when he was four months old , and was completely unable to walk			2
unorthodox : @entity4 the bulldog is taken for a walk in a water tank to help his rehabilitation the tendons in his front legs had not grown properly because of the terrible diet he was fed , and the @entity20 bulldog could only crawl around in constant pain			1
staff at @entity23 in @entity24 fell in love with the striking - looking puppy , and decided to rule out putting him down			2
' he looked totally sad , ' said vet @entity27			0
' he would just look at us as if to say , " help me			0
" ' we thought he would never come back from this , but look at him now			0
' experts turned to unorthodox techniques to help @entity4 overcome his rare condition , which is called @entity34			1
standing proud : the puppy is recovering from a devastating leg condition caused by a poor diet therapy : as well as the underwater treadmill , @entity4 practices dog yoga and undergoes acupuncture he was fitted with splints which support his walking , and put on a rehabilitation programme including dog yoga which stretches out his tendons and strengthens his legs			1
the dog is also given water therapy , which sees him put in a life jacket and placed on an underwater treadmill			1
this allows him to take the weight off his legs and walk in greater freedom			0
after his workout , @entity4 undergoes 20 minutes of acupuncture which is supposed to relax his muscles and stimulate the bloodflow			1
happy : the puppy hanging out with vet @entity62 from @entity23 in @entity24 just three weeks after he began the intensive programme , the dog is already able to place his front feet normally			2
staff hope that in 18 months , once his bones have fully formed , he will no longer need the splints to walk			0
not only has @entity4 recovered his health , he has also found a new home after @entity23 nurse @entity72 decided to adopt the puppy			1
' we definitely made the right choice , ' the 25 - year - old said			0
' we just want him to have a normal life			0
we want him to be comfortable and pain free			0

@entity4 *'s* poor diet meant his tendons did not grow and he could only crawl
but vets took pity on him and nursed him to health with water treatment
@entity88 puppy is also given acupuncture and practices dog yoga
