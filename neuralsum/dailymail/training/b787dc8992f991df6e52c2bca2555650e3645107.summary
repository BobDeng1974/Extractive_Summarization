nurses wore too much protective clothing while treating @entity3 ' patient zero ' @entity4 , the @entity5 has claimed			1
the shocking accusation is the latest of many contradictions made by the center as it emerges medical chiefs are still not sure how to tackle the deadly virus			1
blaming staff at @entity13 for the latest outbreaks , @entity5 director dr @entity11 said removing multiple layers of gloves and overalls is so difficult that it increases the risk of contamination			1
his words come hours before he faces a grilling alongside the operator of the @entity25 hospital on @entity26 as @entity27 desperately tries to determine why so many failings have occurred			1
' and the risk of contamination during the process of taking these gloves off gets much higher			2
that 's true for several different areas of the body , ' @entity11 said last night			2
the allegation is expected to be rebuffed by dr @entity38 , the operator of the @entity25 hospital in which two nurses contracted @entity3 , when the pair appear together before @entity27 at noon today			1
dr @entity38 , chief clinical officer at @entity37 , conceded that errors were made by presbyterian hospital in @entity64 , which sent @entity4 home after he complained of a fever and abdominal pain when he arrived from his native @entity68 last month			1
' unfortunately , in our initial treatment of mr @entity4 , despite our best intentions and highly skilled medical team , we made mistakes , ' @entity38 will tell the @entity27			1
' we did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of @entity3			2
we are deeply sorry '			0
@entity4 died on october 8 , a week after he became the first person diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity77 , and two weeks since he first sought treatment at the hospital 's @entity80 department			1

however , it has subsequently retracted this statement			0
dr @entity38 wrote in his testimony : ' in our effort to communicate to the public quickly and transparently , we inadvertently provided some information that was inaccurate and had to be corrected			1
' he conceded that this had been ' unsettling to a community that was already concerned and confused '			0
two nurses involved in his care – @entity97 , 26 , and @entity98 , 29 – have since been diagnosed with the virus , raising serious questions about the hospital 's procedures			2
dr @entity38 said said he and his colleagues ' do n't yet know precisely how or when ' @entity104 was infected with @entity3 as she was ' using full protective measures under @entity5 protocols '			1
sickened : @entity98 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) both cared for @entity4 and both have been diagnosed with @entity3 ms @entity98 , in a yellow hazmat suit , is seen boarding a plane bound for @entity111 around 4:30pm on wednesday a plane carrying ms @entity98 , who tested positive for @entity3 , departs @entity113 for @entity114 ms @entity98 's plane landed in @entity114 around 7:45pm @entity116			2
she was then seen being loaded into an ambulance ( pictured ) to be taken to @entity118 the @entity120 union criticised @entity122 's care after medical records suggested staff worked in the quarantine unit with their skin exposed during the three days between when the patient was admitted and when he was diagnosed			0
they alleged other failings in protective clothing and the isolation of @entity4			0
the 77 healthcare workers believed to have worked in the quarantine room with @entity4 or handled samples of his blood are being monitored for symptoms			0
dr @entity38 said in his testimony the staff had been separated into three categories based on how at - risk they were			1
those at highest risk have been told to stay off work and not use public transport and were required to remain in the county where they live			2
in a statement on wednesday , the @entity5 said : ' the @entity5 confirms that the second healthcare worker who tested positive last night for @entity3 traveled by air october 13 , the day before she reported symptoms			1
' because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning , @entity5 is reaching out to passengers who flew on @entity158 flight 1143 @entity159 to @entity64 / @entity160 on october 13			2
@entity5 is asking all 132 passengers on the @entity158 flight ( the flight route was @entity159 to @entity164 and landed at 8.16pm ct ) to call 1 800 - @entity165 ( 1 800 232 - 4636 )			2
after 1pm et , public health professionals will begin interviewing passengers about the flight , answering their questions , and arranging follow up			0
individuals who are determined to be at any potential risk will be actively monitored			0
the healthcare worker exhibited no signs or symptoms of illness while on flight 1143 , according to the crew			0
@entity158 is working closely with @entity5 to identify and notify passengers who may have traveled on the flight			0

those flights include a return flight to @entity159 , @entity159 to @entity186 – @entity187 ( @entity187 ) , fll to @entity159 , @entity159 to @entity188 – @entity189 ( @entity189 ) , and @entity189 to @entity159			0
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) have also come under fire for their handling of the deadly virus			1
@entity5 director @entity11 has admitted he should have sent a bigger team to @entity64 after the initial diagnosis			1
this was despite him making a prediction in august that major hospitals would be equipped to tackle the disease			0
the @entity5 have also faced criticism for allowing ms @entity98 , the second nurse to contract @entity3 , to board a commercial flight despite her alarmingly high temperature			1
ms @entity98 had asked the @entity5 whether should could take a flight on october 13 to @entity203 , where she was to spend time with her family			0
she had been told to proceed because her temperature of @entity207 ( @entity208 ) fell below the @entity5 threshold of @entity210			2
@entity5 officials have since acknowledged that she should not have flown on a commercial plane			0
dr @entity11 said : ' those who have exposures to @entity3 , she should not have traveled on a commercial airline			1
' the @entity5 guidance in this setting outlines the need for controlled movement			0
that can include a charter plane ; that can include a car ; but it does not include public transport			0
' we will from this moment forward ensure that no other individual who is being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than controlled movement			0
' the @entity5 is now trying to contact every person that was on @entity230 on monday			0
ms @entity98 reported to the hospital on tuesday , the day after she landed , and was put in isolation within 90 minutes			0

he said : ' we 're reviewing exactly how we 're going to make sure that something like this is not repeated – and we are monitoring , supervising , overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what has taken place in @entity64 initially , and making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals and clinics all across the country			0
' the president also said the @entity5 would launch a ' rapid response @entity253 ' within 24 hours whenever a new case is confirmed			1
@entity237 is struggling amid low approval ratings to show that he is in command of the world 's most sophisticated public health infrastructure as @entity3 threatens to claim tens of thousands of lives across the @entity261 .			1
