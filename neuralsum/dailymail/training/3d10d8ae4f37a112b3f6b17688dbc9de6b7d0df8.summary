by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 29 october 2013 residents of a quiet @entity3 town fear that a legendary creature called @entity5 has come to life to terrorize them just in time for @entity7			1
@entity8 spotted the hairless beast near her yard in the suburban town of @entity12 last week			1
@entity13 , canine - like and lumbering , she said the unwanted visitor was like nothing she ’d ever seen			2
‘ if a zombie had a dog , ’ @entity17 said , ‘ it would look like that			0
the footage shows an animal not unlike a dog , but hairless and with a strange , elongated snout			2
it looks just like @entity5 , a creature originally of @entity46 legend whose notoriety has spread to the mainland @entity49 along with alleged sightings of the livestock killing , blood sucking monster			1
down the street from the @entity56 , the @entity54 family had seen it , too			0
' if a zombie had a dog , it would look like that , ' said resident @entity8 , who caught the animal on video with her son @entity32 mangy ? @entity3 wildlife authority @entity65 has n't seen the creature but believes it 's likely a coyote with a bad case of the mange opportunistic ? @entity65 says the animal is likely very ill and staying close to human habitats in order to have an easily obtainable source of food in the form of trash @entity79 did the natural things and turned to @entity81 for an answer			1
‘ i kept looking up “ hairless coyote ” and it kept saying “ chupacabra , ” ’ @entity54 told @entity38			2
thereafter , she stopped taking chances and made sure to avoid a potential encounter with @entity5			2
‘ we 've been running back and forth to our cars because we did n't want the chupacabra to get us , ’ she said			0
authorities were called , but at first their efforts were for naught			0
‘ i did n't know what it was , but then @entity97 could n't find it , so maybe it was a chupacabra , ’ said @entity54 ’s husband @entity94			0
legend and sightings of @entity5 the word comes from two @entity103 words - ' chupar ' , to suck , and ' cabra ' , goat			1
the first reported sighting was in 1995 , when eight sheep were found dead in @entity46 with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood			1
thus , the legend of the livestock killing , vampire - like chupacabra was born			0
since then , the legendary beast has been spotted across the @entity114 and even the world			2
a @entity117 incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on @entity5 in 2012			1
earlier this year , yet another @entity3 sighting came when a @entity121 man actually shot and killed what he claimed was @entity5			1
even a @entity124 town had a @entity5 sighting this past july ' goat sucker ' : the legend of @entity5 likely originates from a 1995 case in @entity46 where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds			1
it has been described as hairless , or as having spines along its back , and as having blue or red eyes , among other attributes science attempts to explain scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be @entity5 are actually wildlife like coyotes , foxes , and stray dogs infested with parasites			1
most commonly pointed to is the parasite @entity148 , which causes mange			0
@entity150 is a painful , potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel , making for an even more ghoulish looking beast			0
in humans , @entity148 causes scabies and a consequent itchy , painful rash as the parasites burrow around , leaving their feces under the skin			0
finally , the @entity164 , and @entity165 was called			0
residents told master sergeant @entity65 what they saw and finally got a possible answer			0
‘ the way they described it to me , ’ said @entity65 , ‘ it ’s a coyote that ’s really bad off with the mange			0
’ @entity65 did n’t see the creature , but says it should n’t be an issue in the neighborhood so long as residents keep their distance			2
‘ it 's probably sick , weak , and not able to hunt on its own , so it 's going to the nearest food source it can find , ’ he said			2
common ? the @entity12 sighting was not the first , even inn @entity3			1
a man in @entity121 , @entity3 shot and killed this animal he insisted was @entity5 just last month pan-american : this alleged @entity5 showed up in @entity189 in 2010 that source happens to the trash left out by @entity12 ’s townspeople			1
the department advised residents ‘ to let nature take its course			0
’ similar alleged @entity5 spottings have been reported everywhere from nearby @entity121 — where a man actually shot and killed the hairless beast he spotted — to @entity117 and all the way in @entity124 , where farmers killed what some say was a chupacabra that was attacking local cows			1
in some instances , like in @entity121 , a mange - infested animal was blamed			0
in @entity124 , some say the creature was actually a fox poisoned by radiation			0
in any case , believers become more and more convinced they 've seen the legendary @entity5 remain adamant that the beast is real and as sightings continue popping up in @entity216 , the @entity49 and across the world			1

the townsfolk of quiet @entity12 , @entity3 are keeping their distance from a hairless , menacing - looking creature that 's taken up residence in their yards
the bald beast looks *remarkably* like @entity5 , a legendary creature known as the ' goat sucker '
the story of @entity5 began in @entity46 when farmers began to find their goats dead and drained of all their blood
