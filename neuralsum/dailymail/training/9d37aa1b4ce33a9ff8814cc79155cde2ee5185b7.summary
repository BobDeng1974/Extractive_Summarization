by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:05 est , 28 december 2012 @entity2 : 05:38 est , 29 december 2012 a cruise around the @entity4 aboard one of the world ’s largest passenger ships carries connotations of glamour , elegance and sophistication			2
unfortunately for @entity14 and her family , the 2,500 - strong gang of raucous , heavy - drinking , leather - clad bikers and their partners who were sharing their voyage had rather different ideas			1
from the moment the bikers stepped on board the @entity25 ship , which carries 3,600 passengers , the trip to celebrate mrs @entity14 ’s 50th birthday was a disaster			1
one of the bikers is pictured taking part in the rowdy ' belly smacker ' competition @entity39 dive : the gang was aboard the cruise as part of their annual ' @entity44 ' and members were accused of wearing sexually explicit t - shirts and even having sex in the hot tub the gang , who were on their annual ‘ @entity44 ’ , could not have been much further removed from the usual cruise ’s sedate complement of families and retired couples			1
they monopolised the swimming pool areas on board , holding rowdy competitions such as ‘ belly smacker ’ diving and a contest in which women judged topless men ’s bodies by rubbing baby oil on them while blindfolded			0
one passenger complained of bikers wearing sexually explicit t - shirts , fighting , and even having sex in hot tubs , despite there being youngsters on board			1
even on shore stops there was no escape			0
a visit to the beach in @entity80 was spoiled when hundreds of the bikers turned up			2
‘ they were very loud and sitting so close they could have held my hand , ’ said mrs @entity14			1
‘ i went back to the ship because i could n’t stand it			2
’ on another stop the ship was over two hours late leaving port because hundreds of the bikers failed to return on time			2
disgust : @entity14 from @entity92 and her two children @entity93 and @entity95 went on the cruise with mrs @entity98 's husband @entity97 and four other relatives			1
their week - long cruise was ruined by the rowdy bikers also on board rubbed up : a contest in which women judged topless men 's bodies by rubbing baby oil on them while blindfolded oily : @entity110 firm @entity109 had given no warning to other families that the voyage would be largely made up of those from the biker event @entity110 firm @entity109 had given no warning to other families that the voyage would be mostly taken up by the bikers ’ event			1
mrs @entity14 , a school administrator , and her auditor husband @entity97 , 42 , from @entity92 , went with children @entity93 , 12 , and @entity95 , 13 , as well as four other relatives , including mrs @entity14 ’s sisters			1
the total cost for the group of eight was around £ 4,000 , not including flights			0
the week - long cruise started from @entity128 in @entity129 at the end of october and included stops at several @entity4 islands			2
initially the sea was choppy , due to the after - effects of @entity135 , and the family went straight to their cabin			2
but the next morning they discovered that it was n’t only the seas that were a little on the rough side			0
@entity144 : members of the gang line up for a best beard competition in which female members judged them by smelling and touching the facial hair sniff : a woman judging one of the biker 's beards by smelling it fancy dress : women take part in the @entity160 ' contest mrs @entity14 said of the bikers : ‘ we went to sit around the pool and they quickly took over the whole area			1
i was very upset and just thought , “ @entity165 , this is horrendous ”			0
they were drinking heavily all day and it was just very inappropriate for children			0
’ some areas of the ship were cordoned off for the bikers , who even had their own shows in the evening			2
mrs @entity14 had been looking forward to dressing formally for ‘ fine dining ’ in the restaurant and had bought several outfits			1
but on the first night they walked in to discover all the other diners in jeans , t - shirts and leathers			0
one biker said to her : ‘ i think you are in the wrong dining room , ma’am			0
’ ‘ we did n’t dress up at all after that , ’ she recalled			0
excuse : the @entity14 family was initially told by the cruise operator that they had not been warned due to data protection and were offered £ 150 in credits for a future trip @entity192 : punters hold their bingo cards in the air during ' @entity196 ' ‘ i was absolutely disgusted by the whole thing , ’ said mrs @entity14			1
‘ when we complained about not being warned , we were given some ridiculous excuse blaming it on data protection			0
' all they offered us was £ 150 in credits for a future trip			0
’ after the @entity205 contacted @entity109 , it increased its offer to a credit for the full value of the cruise for @entity210 and mrs @entity14 and their children , to be used for a future booking			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we welcome all groups who choose to sail with us and we are not prejudiced against any guests			0
‘ on this particular sailing , the majority of customers had a great holiday			0

@entity14 and her family were ' disgusted ' by antics of gang on cruise
bikers were staging annual ' @entity44 ' aboard @entity109 ship
reports of fighting , wearing sexually explicit clothing and heavy drinking
mrs @entity14 said family was not warned about the biker event beforehand
