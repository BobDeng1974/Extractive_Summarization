' they have been given practical guidance on clothing , including footwear and we ’ve advised comfortable , unbranded or @entity7 shoes should be worn			1
’ organisers have given ' practical advice ' on footwear and said that only @entity7 trainers , left , or shoes without clear branding on them , right , should be worn 2,000 performers will take part in the @entity3 and line the route as participants make their way from the @entity45 to the @entity23 ahead of the @entity29			1
the mother of one of the ten - year - olds due to take part said the regulations risked souring the once - in - a - lifetime event			1
@entity51 , 36 , said : ' if they are told what to wear , it spoils the occasion			2
' they should be allowed to wear what they want as long as they look smart because not every parent can afford buy @entity7 shoes , ' she told the @entity62			1

he said : ' we have to protect of course the sponsors , it goes without saying			0
you can not ask a company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and not be protected against ambush marketing			0
' but the fight against ambush marketing will be led with a lot of common sense			0
everything that is in good faith will not be affected and will not be forbidden			0
