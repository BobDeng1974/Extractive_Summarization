the most surprising thing about @entity1 this year was n't what the models were wearing , but what they were drinking			1
the elixir on every fashionista 's lips was bone broth , which is being sold by the cup from a hip new @entity11 shop			1
aficionados claim that it is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen , and that drinking it will do everything from warding off illnesses to curing joint pain , and giving you healthy skin , nails and hair			1
and at just 86 calories per cup , it 's a very slimming lunch option			1
it 's catching on here , too - celebrity chefs @entity32 and @entity34 , whose healthy cookbook @entity36 knocked @entity37 and @entity38 off the top of the @entity41 charts , advocate ladlefuls of bone broth in everything from stews to scrambled eggs			1
making it could n't be easier : simply add 2 - 3kg of bones from any beef , lamb or chicken carcass to a pan of water with a couple of onions , leeks , carrots and celery sticks			0
add a tablespoon of peppercorns , a bay leaf and a dash of cider vinegar and simmer for up to 24 hours			0
it may sound like old - fashioned stock , but fans claim bone broth is different because it simmers for eight hours longer , which helps break down the protein you get from the bones			1
but @entity72 , spokesman for the @entity73 , is n't convinced			0
' @entity74 does contain nutrients , minerals and vitamins , but in pretty low quantities			0
you 'd get far more goodness from just eating meat			0
' however , she says , making your own stock is ' certainly better than buying it in a cube , as you can control what goes in it '			0
bone broths have traditionally been prescribed for colds , flu and digestive health , says @entity93 , a registered dietitian			2
' the main protein in bone broth is gelatine			2
gelatine supplements have been shown to improve pain and stiffness in osteoarthritis sufferers , but whether you get the same benefits from broth is unclear			2
' so is bone broth a magic bullet for superhuman health and supermodel looks ? probably not			2
but is it much better for you than a supermarket - bought stock cube ? almost certainly .			0
