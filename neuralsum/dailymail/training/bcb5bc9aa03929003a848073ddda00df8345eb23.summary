' just war ' : @entity1 says left - wing myths about the @entity3 peddled by @entity4 belittle @entity5 and clear @entity6 of blame left - wing myths about the @entity3 peddled by @entity4 belittle @entity5 and clear @entity6 of blame , @entity1 says today			1
the education secretary criticises historians and tv programmes that denigrate patriotism and courage by depicting the war as a ‘ misbegotten shambles ’			1
as @entity5 prepares to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war , mr @entity1 claims only undergraduate cynics would say the soldiers were foolish to fight			1
in an article for the @entity23 , mr @entity1 says he has little time for the view of the @entity26 and the @entity27 that the commemorations should not lay fault at @entity6 ’s door			1
the education secretary says the conflict was a ‘ just war ’ to combat aggression by a @entity6 elite bent on domination			1
‘ @entity3 may have been a uniquely horrific war , but it was also plainly a just war , ’ he says			1
‘ the ruthless social darwinism of the @entity6 elites , the pitiless approach they took to occupation , their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified			1
’ @entity5 has pledged £ 50million in public money to mark the event , with school trips to battlefields and ceremonies planned over four years			2
the @entity55 government has also embraced the centenary , planning 1,500 events across the country			2
but there are few plans for events in @entity6 itself			1
mr @entity1 , who has rewritten the school history curriculum to give pupils a better grasp of the broad sweep of @entity5 history , reserves his greatest scorn for those who have sought to depict the soldiers as lions led by donkeys			2
he says : ‘ the war was , of course , an unspeakable tragedy , which robbed this nation of our bravest and best			1
‘ but it ’s important that we do n’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict in the last 70 or so years			2
‘ the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity4 as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out - of - touch elite			1
’ @entity91 playing @entity92 , in the film oh ! what a @entity85 : mr @entity1 singles out the film as propagating what he calls the myth of the @entity3 as a ' misbegotten shambles ' mr @entity1 turns his fire on ‘ left - wing academics all too happy to feed those myths by attacking @entity5 ’s role in the conflict ’			1
he singles out @entity103 , regius professor of history at @entity105 , who has said those who enlisted in 1914 were wrong to think they were fighting to defend freedom			2
@entity109 : @entity110 , as @entity111 , in the 1980s television series @entity86 , another of the tv programmes mr @entity1 targets mr @entity1 writes : ‘ @entity103 may hold a professorship , but these arguments , like the interpretations of @entity85 and @entity4 , are more reflective of the attitude of an undergraduate cynic playing to the gallery in a @entity122 revue rather than a sober academic contributing to a proper historical debate			2
’ the education secretary says it is time to listen to historians such as @entity128 who has ‘ demonstrated how those who fought were not dupes but conscious believers in king and country , committed to defending the western liberal order ’			1
he also cites the work of professor @entity136 , who has reassessed the damaged reputation of @entity5 commander @entity139 sir @entity138			2
@entity140 cast @entity141 in the title role as a captain in the trenches of @entity145 during 1917			2
it focused largely on his cowardly attempts to avoid certain death through going ‘ over the top ’ to engage the enemy			2
under the misguided leadership of a general played by @entity154 , and with little help from the hapless @entity156 ( @entity157 ) plus a twittish ex-public schoolboy played by @entity159 , it chronicles his increasingly gutless efforts to dodge the action or escape the trenches			2
the series was written by four weddings and @entity166 creator @entity165 in partnership with left - wing comic @entity168			0
it is still shown in schools to help children learn about the war			1
by @entity1 , education secretary the past has never had a better future			1
because history is enjoying a renaissance in @entity5			0
after years in which the study of history was declining in our schools , the numbers of young people showing an appetite for learning about the past , and a curiosity about our nation ’s story , is growing once more			0
as a government , we ’ve done everything we can to support this restoration			0
we ’ve changed how schools are judged , and our new measure of academic success for schools and pupils , the @entity193 baccalaureate , rewards those who study history at @entity199			0
and the changes we ’ve made to the history curriculum have been welcomed by top academics as a way to give all children a proper rounded understanding of our country ’s past and its place in the world			0
captain @entity210 : @entity157 as @entity156 , left , and @entity141 as @entity4 in the titular sit - com , which education secretary @entity1 blames for distorting attitudes about the @entity3 that understanding has never been needed more			1
because the challenges we face today – great power rivalry , migrant populations on the move , rapid social upheaval , growing global economic interdependence , massive technological change and fragile confidence in political elites – are all challenges our forebears faced			0
indeed , these particular forces were especially powerful one hundred years ago – on the eve of the @entity3			0
which is why it is so important that we commemorate , and learn from , that conflict in the right way in the next four years			0
the government wants to give young people from every community the chance to learn about the heroism , and sacrifice , of our great - grandparents , which is why we are organising visits to the battlefields of the @entity242			0
the war was , of course , an unspeakable tragedy , which robbed this nation of our bravest and best			1
but even as we recall that loss and commemorate the bravery of those who fought , it ’s important that we do n’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict			0
our understanding of the war has been overlaid by misunderstandings , and misrepresentations which reflect an , at best , ambiguous attitude to this country and , at worst , an unhappy compulsion on the part of some to denigrate virtues such as patriotism , honour and courage			1
the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as @entity270 ! what a @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity4 , as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out - of - touch elite			1
even to this day there are left - wing academics all too happy to feed those myths			0
professor sir @entity103 , the @entity105 historian and @entity279 writer , has criticised those who fought , arguing , ‘ the men who enlisted in 1914 may have thought they were fighting for civilisation , for a better world , a war to end all wars , a war to defend freedom : they were wrong ’			1
and he has attacked the very idea of honouring their sacrifice as an exercise in ‘ narrow tub - thumping jingoism ’			0
these arguments are more reflective of the attitude of an undergraduate cynic playing to the gallery in a @entity122 revue rather than a sober academic contributing to a proper historical debate			0
the @entity3 may have been a uniquely horrific war , but it was also plainly a just war			1
@entity302 , regius professor of moral and pastoral theology at the @entity304 , laid out the ethical case for our involvement in a superb essay in september ’s @entity309			0
the ruthless social darwinism of the @entity6 elites , the pitiless approach they took to occupation , their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified			1
and the war was also seen by participants as a noble cause			1
historians have skilfully demonstrated how those who fought were not dupes but conscious believers in king and country , committed to defending the western liberal order			0
other historians have gone even further in challenging some prevailing myths			0
generals who were excoriated for their bloody folly have now , after proper study , been re-assessed			0
@entity138 , held up as a crude butcher , has been seen in a new light thanks to professor @entity136 , of @entity336 , who depicts him as a patriotic leader grappling honestly with the new complexities of industrial warfare			0
even the @entity340 , once considered the epitome of military futility , has now been analysed in depth by the military historian @entity344 and recast as a precursor of allied victory			0
rehabilitated : even field marshal @entity138 , popularly known as ' the butcher of the @entity348 ' , has been seen in a new light thanks to professor @entity136 , of @entity336 , writes @entity1 there is , of course , no unchallenged consensus			0
that is why it matters that we encourage an open debate on the war and its significance			1
but it is important to recognise that many of the new analyses emerging challenge existing left - wing versions of the past designed to belittle @entity5 and its leaders			0
instead , they help us to understand that , for all our mistakes as a nation , @entity5 ’s role in the world has also been marked by nobility and courage			0
indeed , the more we reflect on every aspect of the war , the more cause there is for us to appreciate what we owe to our forebears and their traditions			2
but whatever each of us takes from these acts of remembrance and hours of debate it is always worth remembering that the freedom to draw our own conclusions about this conflict is a direct consequence of the bravery of men and women who fought for , and believed in , @entity5 ’s special tradition of liberty .			0
