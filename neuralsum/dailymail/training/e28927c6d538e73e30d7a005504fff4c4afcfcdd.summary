it 's been another busy week in the world of boxing and it 's only going to get busier for me between now and may 31 – @entity5 is a big stadium to fill but @entity6 and @entity7 have a better chance than anyone else of filling it			1
more of that later , though , because for now i want to talk about a fight that would excite me just as much			2
i think @entity13 would knock @entity14 out			1
i 'm positive about that			0
now it 's time to try to make the fight			1
that 's the hard part			2
i have spoken to @entity19 , @entity14 's people in the @entity21 , and made @entity14 an offer of $ 5million			1
i 'm not sure if it will happen this summer because @entity14 seems to be under the impression that he 's above fighting @entity13 , but that is a fight i would love to see			1
i think turning it down would be a massive risk on his part and i 'll explain why			0
@entity13 will be warming up for his @entity42 title shot against @entity43 with a fight in @entity45 on march 15 and i can reveal here that it will be against the @entity49 welterweight champion @entity48 , who has 17 wins ( 15 @entity51 ) and two losses			1
if @entity13 wins that , @entity43 will have to defend his @entity42 world title against him this summer			1
the only fight @entity13 would sidestep that for is @entity14			1
@entity14 has a lot to lose against @entity13			1
if he gets knocked out , and i believe he will , i think that his career is over			0
he thinks he can fight @entity58 , @entity59 and then @entity13			1
the problem with that is @entity13 will go off and fight @entity43 and if he wins that title then there is no way @entity14 will be getting $ 5m as a challenger			1
take your risks @entity68 , but realise what you are turning down			0
offer : @entity14 has been offered $ 5m to fight @entity13 below him ? @entity14 seems to think fighting @entity13 ( right ) is below him in either case , the next few months for @entity13 will be massive			1
after what he 's been through , it is time something went his way			2
he is 28 now and is an immense talent , a wonderful boxer who has won all 31 of his fights , but the past few years have just not gone his way			0
he should be a world champion by now			0
his career was a textbook example of progression until he was meant to fight @entity82 for the world title in 2013			2
you could n't make up what has happened since then			0
talent : @entity13 deserves something to go his way after what happened with injuries when he was meant to fight @entity82 first , @entity13 injures his ankle and the fight is postponed			1
it gets rearranged and 10 days out @entity82 pulls out with a bicep injury			0
@entity13 was his destroying sparring partners and ready to a job on @entity82			1
@entity82 's withdrawal really hit @entity13 hard , he lost some of his professionalism and dedication in the sport			1
he had a few weeks off , put on a bit of weight			0
we rescheduled the fight , came back and then he had a problem with his foot			1
he went to see a doctor and they said he had two stress fractures in his foot			0
that was hard for him to take			0
three times that fight was cancelled ! he came back against @entity112 and got the job done			1
then he fought @entity114 and looked fantastic			0
at that point he was due to fight @entity82 in march or april of this year but @entity82 lost to @entity43			2
that was never supposed to happen			0
decisions : @entity14 wants to fight @entity59 but will be giving up a big payday if he sidesteps @entity13 that was the same night @entity120 fought @entity121			1
i was sat watching the @entity43 fight with @entity13 in our hotel			1
the look on our faces			0
he just kept saying , ' i ca n't believe it '			0
what are the chances ? but @entity13 is over that now			1
he knows he is close to getting the huge fight he deserves			2
he is like my special project , a fighter who i respect and rate enormously			2
people might have given up on him , but i believe when he gets that chance he will rule the division			2
he has as much talent as any fighter in @entity139 and more than @entity14			1
this will be his year			0
@entity5 is set for the biggest @entity139 boxing event of all time			1
my dream of an 80,000 capacity crowd could become a reality			0
tickets will go on sale on monday , march 10			2
@entity5 and the @entity148 have done everything they can the make the fight happen and it will be on @entity152 in @entity21			1
we will put 60,000 on sale initially and i am confident they will fly away			0
in @entity156 we sold 20,000 in 12 minutes and this is five times the size of the fight			2
i am anticipating huge sales on day one and two			0
there will be a lot more more cheap seats and tickets will start at £ 30			1
i want it to be as accessible as possible			0
we already have 24,000 on our email alerts			0
if the average one of those wants three tickets , we will be well on the way to living the dream			2
you need to be part of it			0
massive : @entity175 will be the biggest boxing event of all time - and tickets will start at just £ 30 if ever you could back a fighter to bounce back from a defeat then it would be @entity181			1
he lost in @entity182 on saturday against @entity183 , who just had too much for him			0
we hoped @entity183 would crack under the pressure of being the away fighter – my word , it was some atmosphere - and we were keeping fingers crossed that he would n’t be as good as he has looked			2
unfortunately he had it all and @entity181 probably was n’t at his best coming back from an injury			1
i had a long chat with @entity181 about his future on sunday after the fight			1
he wants to be back in the gym as soon as possible			0
he might even fight the winner of @entity200 and @entity201 , which i am hoping to make			0
there are some big domestic fights but the target for @entity206 is ultimately to win back a world title			2
i 'd back him to be on top before long			0
bouncing back : @entity181 is a fighter you can expect to recover from a defeat top class : @entity183 showed he had it all the demand for @entity213 is at an all - time high			1
he gets mobbed everywhere we go			0
one thing that made me laugh recently was going up to @entity218 for his fight at the weekend			2
we went through security and this older lady came up to him and said : ‘ i ca n’t believe it ’s you ’			0
her mouth was wide open , she was totally awestruck			0
he was saying ‘ thanks , that ’s very kind , ’ but then she just said : ‘ i love your new dance show on @entity229			0
’ she thought he was @entity230 ! mistaken identity : @entity213 was mistaken in @entity182 for dancer @entity230			1

@entity5 is a big stadium to fill but @entity6 and @entity7 have a better chance than anyone
tickets will start at just £ 30 , i want the super fight to be *affordable*
i think @entity13 would knock @entity14 out - i *'ve* made @entity14 an offer of $ 5m to get in the ring with @entity13
if you ever back a fighter to bounce back from defeat it 's @entity181
@entity213 has a case of mistaken identity *...*
