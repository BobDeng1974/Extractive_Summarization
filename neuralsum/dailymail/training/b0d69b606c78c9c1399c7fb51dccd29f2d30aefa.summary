sir @entity7 did n't get an awful lot wrong during his time at @entity10 but , three - and - half years after he said it , his assertion that @entity2 and @entity3 would be @entity5 's central defensive pairing of the future remains distinctly unproven			1
' that is how i look upon it , ' said @entity7 in an interview with the official @entity16 magazine in february 2011			2
' i think their time will come			0
' had things gone as planned , this indeed would be the era of @entity2 and @entity3			1
both have been at the club for long enough now			0
this season , for the first time , the path to the first team has been left clear by the departures of @entity28 and @entity29			0
@entity3 has failed to cement a place in the heart of @entity10 's defence @entity2 had to be replaced during the first - half against @entity34 with an injury sir @entity7 ( centre right ) predicted @entity3 ( far right ) and @entity2 would be the club 's defensive pairing still @entity10 wait , though			1
as both careers continues to be hampered by injury , @entity2 and @entity3 remain some way short of a pairing that can move @entity10 forwards to where they need to be in the coming weeks , months and years			1
recent problems for @entity46 in his first season at @entity10 have only highlighted the issue			2
four goals were conceded at @entity50 in the @entity51 while an astonishing five were shipped at @entity34 in the @entity52 at the weekend			2
now , with @entity2 injured and young prospect @entity54 suspended after a red card on sunday , @entity53 is having to countenance the prospect of using central midfielder @entity57 as a defender when he returns from the ankle injury that has ruined his summer and early season			1
certainly , it is difficult to see who @entity10 's central defensive pairing will be this time next year , never mind in five years ' time			1
this , as much as anything , illustrates how the natural evolution that top clubs like to oversee in all areas of a playing squad has stalled in defensive areas at @entity5 in recent years			2
@entity2 ' latest injury has added to @entity46 's central defensive crisis at the club @entity3 reacts as @entity10 capitulate in their 5 - 3 @entity52 defeat at @entity34 on sunday midfielder @entity57 could be deployed at centre back for @entity10 when he returns from injury @entity57 has missed the beginning of the campaign after undergoing ankle surgery during pre-season @entity86 intetnational @entity85 ( left ) has failed to make a consistent impact at @entity5 highest number of consecutive league matches played by @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity85 in last two seasons ... @entity2 - seven @entity3 - 12 @entity85 - 11 @entity7 also signed @entity86 man @entity85 from @entity91 three summers ago			1
that was part of the grand plan , too			0
but @entity85 , shunted about too often from midfield to defence , has similarly struggled to consistently make an impact			2
neither of the three players will like to hear it , no player does , but @entity85 , @entity2 and @entity3 are all too injury prone			1
that , in some way , is why it has proved so difficult to judge them			0
certainly in the case of @entity3 and @entity85 it is difficult to judge or predict how effective a @entity10 player they will be simply because we have n't seen enough of them			1
when you consider the fact that @entity2 ( 7 ) , @entity85 ( 11 ) and @entity3 ( 12 ) have managed to pay so few consecutive league games over the course of the last two seasons then the issue with fitness becomes clear			1
there is not a young footballer in the world who will improve if his body does n't allow him to play			0
on sunday at @entity34 , for example , @entity10 arrived in the @entity125 with @entity2 fit , @entity85 injured and @entity3 on the bench after a month out with a groin problem			1
by full - time , @entity2 was in a cast with a foot injury and @entity3 had come on to replace him			1
@entity54 , meanwhile , had been sent off			0
and so it goes on			0
@entity54 ( right ) was sent off for @entity10 during their humbling at the @entity134 @entity2 ( centre ) has only managed to play seven games in a row for @entity10 in the last two years interestingly , @entity10 's medical staff began this season convinced that their defenders would enjoy relatively injury - free campaigns			1
with players like the three we have mentioned reaching physical maturity , it was anticipated inside the club that they would be available more often			0
how you can make those assessments is hard to understand but , whatever the science behind it , the opposite is proving true so far			0
@entity3 and @entity85 are only 24 and 22 , of course			2
they should still have their best years ahead of them			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , is 26 and has shown enough , when fit , to suggest that he has the potential at least to be a @entity10 player of some stature			2
as time moves on , though , so must the careers of these three players			0
as @entity53 has shown so far during his time at the club , if he feels players are n't going to be of sufficient use to him , he will just go and buy somebody else			0
@entity166 gave the game away - @entity53			0

sir @entity7 predicted @entity3 and @entity2 to be @entity10 's future central *partnership* three - and - a - half years ago
the pair have failed to live up to their *billing* at @entity5 so far
@entity3 and @entity2 are both injury prone like @entity85
@entity2 was injured during @entity52 5 - 3 defeat at @entity34
@entity3 has played 12 consecutive games for @entity10 in the last two years
@entity57 may be deployed as a centre back by @entity46
