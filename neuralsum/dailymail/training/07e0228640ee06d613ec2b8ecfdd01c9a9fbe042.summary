by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 23 august 2012 @entity2 ' mod style has seen a resurgence among @entity5 men @entity7 fever has left us all wanting to emulate our @entity10 heroes			2
and gold medal - winning cycling supremo @entity2 is causing more of a to - do than most			2
first @entity5 men got back on their bikes and joined cycling clubs to copy the @entity16 winner			1
( @entity17 reported 1500 new members on the day @entity19 won the @entity7 men 's individual time trial )			2
then @entity5 men gave themselves sideburns			0
and now they are trying to emulate @entity2 's look in the fashion department			0
the @entity27 effect has led to sartorial sale spikes in the sort of ' mod - ish ' clothing favoured by the pedal - pummeling @entity31 , including polo shirts , parkas and loafers			1
@entity36 , trends expert at men 's fashion retailer @entity39 , said he has had a flurry of customers enquiring about getting @entity2 's look			0
he said : ' it started with cut - out sideburns and everyone talking about @entity2 's style with light - hearted praise , but what we are seeing now is a real determination to copy this gold medal - winning @entity7 star 's look			0
' his style is deliberately ' mod ' , paying attention to key aspects such as tailored suits , skinny trousers and loafers			2
' his icons are stars such as @entity63 and @entity64 's @entity65 , and this is represented in the way he styles himself			0
' @entity2 with his style hero @entity63 polo shirts , a @entity27 sartorial staple , have been flying off shelves at shops such as @entity39 the term ' mod ' , which derives from the word ' modernist ' , was first coined in the 1950s as a way to describe @entity5 style - conscious modern jazz fans			1
the term is synonymous with those who are fashionable , modern and popular			0
mr @entity36 continued : ' customers are really keen to achieve the ' @entity27 ' look and we are helping style them in this way			1
' the one thing we ca n’t advise on is achieving the mod attitude to life , but dressing like their idol is part of the key to success in this area			0
' @entity2 in typically mod - ish attire while spectating at the @entity31 2012 games @entity2 favours clean , tailored lines resonant of the styles of @entity63 and @entity64 speaking about @entity19 , mr @entity36 added : ' men want to be friends with him and women love his charisma			0
' we still get requests , despite the fact he has been in the limelight for a long time now , to kit men out in tailored , made to measure suits so they can achieve his clean - cut , chic look ' this is a polished appearance which many identified as having the glamour of @entity112 whereas the @entity2 effect feels more quintessentially @entity5 and is rightly appealing to a nation proud of our sporting achievements at the games			0
' @entity2 often wears skinny tailored suits , left , and long tweed coats , right with his wife @entity120 @entity2 ' summer successes in the @entity16 and in the men 's individual time trial at the @entity124 , pictured above after winning , have led other men to try and emulate his mod style despite dressing like a mod when he goes out , @entity2 has spent the best part of his summer in @entity130 , including here , winning the @entity7 men 's time trial we 'd all like a @entity27 of our very own , would n't we ? but since he 's a happily taken husband and father - of - two , we 'll just have to settle for a paper one			1
retro graphic specialists @entity138 have created a limited edition @entity2 ' mod ' paper doll for you to cut out and keep			1
@entity27 comes wearing his @entity16 yellow jersey and black lycra shorts , but has the option to change into a skinny blue suit , a green parka , sunglasses and even an @entity149			1
each print 400mm x 300mm print is signed by the artist and printed on high quality 250 gram silk paper			2
