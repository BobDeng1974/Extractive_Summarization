@entity8 was n’t allowed to get her picture taken for a @entity11 id card because of her choice to wear a hijab			1

' keep calm and wear a hijab ' : student @entity8 was told she must get written permission from both her chaplain and mosque in order to wear a hijab on @entity11 's campus in @entity2 and now that she has permission , @entity28 is carrying around the proof wherever she goes			1

excessive ? @entity28 got permission to wear the symbol of her faith but believes the rule at the private , historically black university should be overturned ' i want to have all the proof that i can ' : @entity28 has decided to carry the papers at all times in order to show anyone who might question her right to be on campus since the historically black school is private , they are allowed to enforce a strict dress code			1
however , they do allow women to wear ‘ headgear considered as a part of religious or cultural dress ’ so long as the student submits ‘ a written request for a review through the @entity68			2
