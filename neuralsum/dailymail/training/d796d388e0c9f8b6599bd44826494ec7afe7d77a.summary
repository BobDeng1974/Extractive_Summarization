by @entity0 published : 07:33 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 8 november 2013 @entity1 has received a three - month prison sentence after she exaggerated an injury in a bid to claim £ 750,000 compensation a mother of 13 who exaggerated an injury in a bid to claim £ 750,000 compensation has been handed a three - month prison sentence			1
but she was allowed to walk free from prison after high court judge mr @entity12 stayed the term - half of which @entity1 would have to serve before her automatic release - so she can lodge an appeal			1
if an appeal is not lodged by november 29 , discontinued or dismissed , she will have to surrender herself into custody			2
former dinner lady @entity1 , who is 60 tomorrow , pretended to be almost totally disabled and in constant agony after falling over a slab of pavement in may 2008			2
she claimed the only way she could get up and down the stairs was by dragging herself on her buttocks and demanded £ 750,000 in compensation from @entity26 for @entity27 , which manages council housing in the north @entity30 borough			1
the organisation admitted liability and offered her £ 7,500 but she pursued the larger claim which was only struck out by a judge in october 2012 after covert video evidence revealed a huge difference between how she presented at medical examinations and when she was out and about near her home in @entity39			1
today mrs @entity1 received a three month prison term for contempt of court , but the judge was forced to stay the sentence until the outcome of any appeal			1
@entity46 , a musician , was also convicted of contempt of court for his part in the claim and received a two month sentence suspended for a year			1
mr @entity12 told the couple they were also liable for £ 100,000 costs , but would only be required to pay ' if they should win the lottery '			1
mr @entity46 had claimed he was working as his wife 's full - time carer but footage shot on september 1 , 2011 , showed mrs @entity1 walking with two heavy bags of shopping			1
she strolled at ' medium to brisk pace ' up the steep hill to her @entity39 home			0
the pair even convinced leading surgeons and psychologists of mrs @entity1 's ' debilitating ' injuries , carefully keeping up the act until they were out of eyeshot			1
her medical records showed a knee complaint which pre-dated the supposed fall by years			0
@entity46 , a musician , was also convicted of contempt of court for his part in the claim and received a two month suspended sentence she said the fall aggravated her pre-existing arthritis to the point where she was no longer able to look after her large family and instead needed their care			1
the couple denied contempt and mrs @entity1 , who is illiterate , claimed she relied on the advice of solicitors , simply signed documents which were not explained properly and that medical experts misinterpreted what she told them			1
but the judge described her as a ' strong and domineering ' character , who actively pursued her case while her unemployed husband of 27 years foolishly went along with it			2
@entity1 ( with walking stick and hand bag ) hides behind her husband @entity98 on the way to court today sentencing the pair , mr @entity12 said , ' @entity101 deliberately exaggerated your continued symptoms from this minor accident in a thoroughly dishonest way			1
' you pretended to be far more seriously affected by the minor injury to your knee than you really were			2
you knew that the whole claim was being presented on a false basis			0
' you have consistently contested the allegations to the hilt			0
in that sense , you have made it worse for yourself			0
' for you , @entity1 , the least sentence i can pass is one of three months imprisonment			1
you will serve one half of that sentence before you are automatically released			0
' you , @entity98 , foolishly allowed yourself to become entangled in your wife 's lies and deception			0
i am persuaded that in your case it is not necessary that the sentence be served immediately			0
' the judge said that false and lying claims undermined the administration of justice in a number of serious ways			0
he said : ' insurers have to spend a great deal of time and money identifying and weeding out claims they think may be fraudulent			0
' false claims damage our whole system in this country of adversarial justice , depending as it does on openness , transparency and honesty			0
' false claims can take up a great deal of court time and precious resources			0
' the courts have made it very clear that those who make false claims and are caught out must expect to go to prison			0
there is no other way to underline the gravity of such conduct and deter those who may be tempted to make such claims , no other way to improve the administration of justice			0
' he said that mrs @entity1 's injury affected her life for only four or five months and was a claim worth a few thousand pounds at most			1
he accepted her solicitors were not the most efficient , but it was mrs @entity1 's conduct which was under the spotlight and it was she who had unusually chosen to contest every allegation to the hilt in the proceedings			1
' false claims damage our whole system in this country of adversarial justice , depending as it does on openness , transparency and honesty ' - mr @entity12 the couple 's counsel , @entity183 , said the couple were the ' engine room ' of their family of children aged 15 to 24 , two of whom are disabled			1
they were the sole earners , receiving income support of £ 190 per week , and their absence would have a far - reaching effect which would outweigh any potential deterrence			2
he emphasised that @entity27 never paid out the money which was claimed and said the couple , who were of previous good character , were essentially good people trying to do their best in difficult circumstances			0
after the hearing , homes for @entity27 's solicitor , @entity206 of @entity207 , said : ' this is a stark warning to anyone tempted to exaggerate a personal injury claim			2
it is not just their compensation they risk losing but also their liberty			0
' if the original claim had been for a realistic sum which reflected the true extent of the injury , this case would have been settled long ago and need never have come to court			2
the courts have sent a consistent and strong message at every stage of these proceedings - fraudulent behaviour will not be tolerated			0
' @entity228 , insurance partner at @entity207 , said ' this decision will make a huge difference in terms of future and indeed current personal injury claims , forcing claimants to focus purely on pursuing the genuine element of their claim , and helping the insurance industry to contain its costs which in turn will benefit society generally			2

@entity1 handed three month prison sentence at @entity30 's @entity243
judge mr @entity12 stayed her term so she can lodge an appeal
@entity243 heard she lied about injury in a bid to claim £ 750,000 compensation
last week judge ruled mrs @entity1 and her husband were in contempt of court
