by @entity0 a class of insecticide called neonicotinoids have already been proved to harm honeybee colonies			1
and now @entity5 researchers have discovered that starlings and swallows disappear in areas treated with the chemical			2
it is the first time that scientists have directly linked a neonicotinoid called imidacloprid to the death of birds			1
the class of neonictinoid insecticide has been linked to the death of 15 species of birds in the @entity5			1
scientists found that the higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water studied , the greater the decline in bird numbers			1
numbers of the birds studied decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre			1
this concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the @entity5			0
they noted that populations of 15 species of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid			1
the experts looked closely at data on local bird population trends and environmental factors , which include imidacloprid concentrations in surface water , to come up with their findings , which were published in the journal @entity59			1
it is the first study to correlate imidacloprid , which is the most widely used insecticide in the world , to possible indirect harmful side effects via the food chain , for birds			0
ecologists at @entity67 and the @entity68 in the @entity5 , explained the trend by identifying concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface water in relation to other factors , such as land use			1
the higher the concentrations of the insecticide in the water , the greater the decline in bird numbers was seen			2
populations of 15 bird species declined by 3.5 per cent on average in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid ( marked in white on the map ) and other regions ( marked in orange and red ) had higher concentrations of the insecticide in the water the focused their study on the starling and barn swallow , which are common in the area			1
@entity97 from the @entity68 explained that the species are relatively easy to study because there is lots of data on them to analyse densities and trends in their numbers			0
most of the birds forage around ditches , hedgerows and field margins to find the insects , which they eat			0
and many of the insects spend part of their life cycle in water , so the scientists measured the water quality taken by district water boards			0
they found that higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water , the greater the decline in bird numbers			2
for the fifteen bird species that were included in the study , populations decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre			1
this concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the @entity5			0
populations of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid			2
a tractor spraying crops with insecticide is pictured it is the first study to correlate imidacloprid , which is the most widely used insecticide in the world , to possible indirect harmful side effects , via the food chain , for birds such as the starling ( pictured ) experts have previously proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter , particularly when temperatures drop			1
research released in may revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives			0
the study by the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) in @entity164 , @entity165 , strengthens the scientists ’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder ( ccd ) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die			2
we demonstrated again in this study that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering ccd in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter , ’ said lead author @entity181 , associate professor of environmental exposure biology at @entity163			0
since 2006 , there have been significant losses of honeybees from @entity172			0
pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one - third of all crops worldwide			0
experts have considered a number of possible causes , including pathogen infestation , beekeeping practices , and pesticide exposure			0
recent findings suggest that @entity172 is related specifically to neonicotinoids including imidacloprid and clothianidin , which may impair bees ’ neurological functions .			0

imidacloprid has been linked to declining bird populations for the first time
the insecticide is a class of neonicotinoid which has been proven to harm honeybee colonies already in a number of scientific studies
biologists from @entity67 , the @entity5 , studied 15 species of birds and the concentrations of insecticide in the local water
populations decreased on average by 3.5 *%* a year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre
many places had higher concentrations of the insecticide in the water
