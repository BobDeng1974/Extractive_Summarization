a teenage school girl has been placed in ' isolation ' by her secondary school which has a ban on ' unnatural ' hair colours after she dyed her hair red			1
@entity6 , 13 , has been told by management at @entity9 's school in @entity10 , west @entity11 that she will not be allowed into classes until she changes the colour of her hair			1
her family said that the year 8 pupil from @entity17 , west @entity11 faces a long period away from her classmates because the colour in her hair was permanent			1
@entity6 , 13 , pictured , has been told she can not attend classes until the red hair colour is removed @entity6 's mother @entity22 said any attempt to change the colour now would cause damage to her daughter 's hair			1
she said the hairdresser even contacted the school to confirm this fact			0
the schools said that the rules are very clear			2
they are in every student ’s planner , tutors regularly remind pupils and a letter was sent home with every pupil in february reminding parents about the rules			2
in january pupil @entity42 , 16 , spent many days in isolation at @entity9 ’s when he turned up with a bleach blond @entity45 haircut			0
he has since changed his hairstyle to comply			0
mrs @entity6 said : ' @entity6 had some red put in her hair , it is not bright red			1
it wo n’t wash out ; it ’s permanent - the more she washes it , the brighter it will get			0
' @entity6 is @entity54 diabetic and needs daily injections			2
i have told the school her blood sugar levels need checking every hour as she is just sitting down all day in isolation and not moving around , which causes her blood sugar levels to go up			0
' it ’s stressful for both of us as she is not allowed her mobile and i ca n’t ring her to check her sugars			0
' she wo n’t learn much in isolation , but i have to send her to school or i will be fined			0
we are at a stalemate as we ca n’t change the colour of the hair			2
' on monday there was a girl there with purple hair , but she is not in isolation - and the head of year i spoke to on the phone has bleach blond hair			1
' head teacher @entity80 said the school rules are very clear about the need for ' a conventional hair colour ' headteacher @entity80 said : ' our rules on this are very clear and have not changed in the time i have been the headteacher , which is over 12 years			1
the girl had two older sisters at the school and the rules have n’t changed			2
' the section about hair states : " hair and make - up : conventional colour and style			1
unnatural colours are not allowed			2
" ' @entity100 goes on to say : " if any student is not in full school uniform or meeting the expectations of appearance , they will have to rectify the situation before they are given permission to go into lessons			0
" ' all schools have similar rules			0
the hair rule , like the other school rules , are there to ensure that nothing detracts children from what they are there for , which is to achieve their potential			1
' if you break the school rules , you are punished , i do n’t know what the story is			0
' @entity125 ( right ) went to school with his hair in a ponytail in the style of @entity131 striker @entity130 ( left ) but the school wrote to his parents saying it was banned because it was associated with drug taking @entity135 did n't think there would be a problem when her son @entity138 said he wanted to go to school at pope @entity140 in @entity142 wearing his hair in a pony tail in the style of @entity131 footballer @entity130			1
but the next day she received a letter telling her that her son 's hairstyle was ' unsuitable ' and headteacher @entity148 told her it was ' associated with drug taking			0
' @entity150 , left , from @entity151 , wanted to have the same haircut as the @entity154 star @entity153 , right ten - year - old @entity155 was told his short back and sides hairstyle , modelled on the @entity154 striker 's look , was too extreme by staff @entity161 's @entity140 in @entity162 , @entity151 , and he was removed from school on his birthday			1
his family say they were told he could either return to classes when his hair had grown , restyle it or wear a hat at all times			0
meanwhile 14 - year - old @entity172 @entity171 was suspended from school after he arrived with a dyed red mohican hairstyle			1
he was sent home from @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 by staff			0
so the youngster decided to post an old photograph of head teacher @entity182 he found on @entity183 featuring the teacher sporting a bright purple hair cut and pink @entity187 boots			0
@entity172 @entity171 found an embarrassing photograph of head teacher @entity182 and posted it to his @entity183 page which led to him receiving a further suspension from his school in @entity178 @entity172 , pictured , had initially been sent home for having a bright red @entity45 style hair cut			1

@entity6 attended school in @entity10 with bright red hair
