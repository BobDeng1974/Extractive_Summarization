this is the awkward moment when one of the men behind @entity4 's first cereal cafe was challenged over selling bowls for £ 3.20 - just feet away from one of @entity9 's poorest areas			1
@entity10 , who founded @entity11 with his twin brother @entity12 , appeared surprised to learn that the restaurant was located in the deprived borough of @entity15 during a tv interview			1
the out - of - touch hipster even claimed that the niche cafe , which opened earlier this week , was ' cheap '			1
small bowls of cereal start at £ 2.50 defensive : after being repeatedly asked about whether he thought people in the area could afford to eat in the cafe , mr @entity10 demands that the interview is stopped , saying he ' does n't like the questions ' the cringe - worthy encounter was captured on camera by @entity27 , who spoke to the identical twins on whether local residents could afford to eat at their cafe			1
the brothers , from @entity43 , opened their venture on @entity45 - a hipster hotspot and home to a number of quirky cafes			1
but the east @entity9 borough is one of the capital 's poorest , where more one in two children grow up living in poverty			1
the establishment is heavy on the nostalgia , with limited - edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear			0
the eighties and nineties ' vibe ' , which is also driving trends in fashion and music , continues with the music choices and vintage magazines			0
the cafe also employs a ' mixologist ' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different			0
after tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer , priced at £ 3.20 , the journalist asks @entity10 whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl			1
hipster : the @entity85 cafe was founded by identical twins @entity12 ( right ) and @entity10 from @entity43 niches : along with 120 varieties of cereal , the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options the restaurateur seems surprised by the question , responding , ' i think it is quite cheap for the area '			1
he is challenged by the interviewer , who points out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of @entity9 - and asks again whether £ 3 seemed like a premium price			1
mr @entity10 looks to justify the extraordinary cost , explaining that many of the brands are ' imported from @entity106 '			2
the interviewer then asks what this means for the people who live in the area , where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent			0
mr @entity10 responds : ' this is n't one of the poorest areas , is it ? ' deprived : the cafe , pictured above , is in @entity15 , where one in two children live in poverty imported : mr @entity10 says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are @entity106 brands the journalist clarifies that it is one of the poorest areas , and asks again whether he thought local people would be able to afford £ 3.20 cereal			1
mr @entity10 responds , ' well , if they are poor , probably not then			1
' the cafe owner becomes defensive and starts asking to stop the interview because ' he does n't like the questions '			0
the interviewer says that he thinks the questions are fair , but the clip ends shortly after			0
earlier this week , the @entity138 spoke about the reason behind opening their cereal cafe			0
@entity10 said : ' we thought " why is n't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal ? " ' so we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business ? how would it look ? where would we get the cereal from ? and everything was just ticking all the boxes for us			1
the cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast , lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day			0
behind the counter , brightly - coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as @entity165 and @entity166 to @entity167 and @entity168			0
asked about his favourite cereal , he said : ' i really love the boo - berry , @entity173 and @entity173 – these are limited - edition @entity175 cereals that are only available one month of the year in @entity106			2
' we 've got these , but really limited - edition , so we 've only got about 20 boxes of them			0
' located in east @entity9 , @entity15 has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year , up from 42 per cent last year			1
it also has the second highest unemployment rate in @entity9			2
every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the @entity9 average			2
but the problems are by no means confined to the economic - @entity15 also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death			2
yet this is only half the picture			0
@entity15 also has some of the highest paid people in @entity9 , working in the financial district of @entity198 , which has @entity200 headquarters for @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			1
the proportion of jobs in @entity15 that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital			2
the borough also boasts booming @entity45 , which lies at the centre of @entity4 's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants			2
at a number of these establishments , including the @entity11 , customers can expect to pay a premium for the out - of - the - ordinary experiences			0
just down the road from @entity221 is @entity223 's @entity222			0
there , visitors pay £ 5 to book a table in the cafe , which is home to a number of rescue cats .			0

@entity11 sells 120 varieties of cereal and a small bowl costs £ 2.50
it opened in @entity45 , in the east @entity9 borough of @entity15
founder @entity10 was asked if he thought locals could afford to eat there
he claimed that it was ' cheap ' and did n't know he worked in a poor area
