the @entity0 are reviewing what establishments should be forced to display calorie counts on their menus , with the idea that many people - ordering at a diner , for example - would pass on that bacon double cheeseburger if they realized it had 1,000 calories			1
the food industry is closely watching what the @entity0 will chose to include in their new menu labeling rules , which are due out this year			1
grocery stores , convenient stores , movie theaters and airplanes are under review - and many are n't happy about it			1
non-restaurant establishments have lobbied hard for exemption , which has lead to a delay in the release of the rules			1
calorie count menus , which have been commonplace at establishments like @entity29 ( pictured ) since 2008 , look set to be expanded into a whole new line of places that serve prepared food the @entity0 believes people would order healthier if they were more aware of the calories in each menu item @entity0 commissioner @entity36 told @entity37 earlier this month that writing the rules has been ' much more challenging than expected '			1
the agency issued proposed rules in 2011 but has faced pressure to revise them to exclude retail outlets like grocery and convenience stores			2
the @entity0 has sent the rules to the @entity47 , meaning they could be released soon			1
the restaurant industry pushed for menu labeling and helped it become law as part of health overhaul in 2010			1
chain restaurants that operate all over the country wanted the federal standards because of an evolving patchwork of state and local laws that require calorie labeling and could have forced those outlets to follow different rules in different locations			2
not all restaurants are happy with menu labeling , though			1
pizza restaurants , led by delivery giant @entity66 , say it does n't make sense to force their franchisees to order expensive new menu boards when few people walk into their brick - and - mortar outlets			1
they argue for putting the information online			0
the pizza companies say there are more than 34 million ways to order a pizza , and they need more flexibility on labeling than other restaurants			0
against : @entity66 's are one of the main establishments fighting the would - be rules , claiming it is intellectual for them to overhaul their menu boards when rarely do people actually order food over-the - counter supporters of the rules say pizzas are no different from sandwiches or other foods that have a variety of toppings			1
the rules will only apply to restaurants with 20 or more outlets , so independent eateries are exempt			0
@entity102 , coffee shops and ice cream parlors are all expected to be included if they have enough stores to qualify			0
but alcohol wo n't have to be labeled in any of those places under the proposed rules			0
the @entity0 proposed exempting it			0
perhaps the most unhappy with the rules that the @entity0 proposed in 2011 were the supermarket and convenience store industries were			2
the agency proposed requiring those stores to label calories for prepared foods on menu boards and displays			1
the restaurant industry has pushed for those outlets to be included , arguing that many of them are promoting their prepared food sales and directly competing with restaurants			2
nutrition advocates have also called for those stores to be included , saying that a rotisserie chicken labeled with a calorie count at a restaurant should also be labeled at the grocery store takeout next door			2
same with baked goods like muffins , pies or loaves of bread			0
@entity134 : movie theaters are among those most likely to display their calories under the @entity0 rules , with their snacks often being so unhealthy the supermarket industry estimates it could cost them a billion dollars to put the rules in place — costs that would be passed on to consumers			1
along with convenience stores , the supermarkets say the ever - changing selection at salad bars , deli counters and other prepared food stations would make it difficult and costly to nail down accurate calorie counts and constantly update signs			1
both industries argue that the law is intended for restaurants and not for them			0
they say the labeling rules will be much easier to put in place at restaurants with fixed menus			2
' the cost of compliance for a convenience store is different than a one - time cost to @entity167 's , ' says @entity168 of the @entity169			0
movie theater chains lobbied to be exempt and appeared to win that fight when they were exempted in the 2011 proposed rules			0
but nutrition groups are lobbying to include them in the final rules , especially because movie treats can be so unhealthy			0
nutrition lobbyist @entity178 of the @entity179 says many people do n't realize they are eating a day 's worth of calories when they stop by the movie concessions counter and grab a large popcorn and extra-large soda			0
vending machines will also display signs indicating the calories of each treat ' if a company is going to serve you 2,000 calories and call it a snack , the least they can do is tell people how many calories are in it , ' @entity178 says			1
passengers will most likely be able to purchase food calorie - blind in the air and on the rails			0
along with movie theaters , airlines and trains were exempted from the proposed labeling rules in 2011			1
the @entity0 said that it would likely exempt food served in places where the ' primary business activity is not the sale of food ' and that do n't ' present themselves publicly as a restaurant '			0
that also includes amusement parks , sports stadiums and hotels , unless restaurants set up in those places are part of a larger chain			0
vending machines will be required to have labels , but the industry — comprised mostly of smaller operators — is asking for flexibility in how they are required to post them			2
@entity229 of the @entity230 says the group estimates the rules could cost operators up to $ 42,000 a year , which he calls a " huge burden " on those small businesses .			0

new menu labeling rules set to be released by the @entity0 later this year
grocery stores , convenient stores , movie theaters , diners , vending machines and airplanes are under review
all would need to display calorie counts for any prepared food offered on menu boards
non-restaurant establishments have lobbied for exemption
@entity66 's have argued they should not have to change their menu boards because rarely do people actually come into a store to order pizza
