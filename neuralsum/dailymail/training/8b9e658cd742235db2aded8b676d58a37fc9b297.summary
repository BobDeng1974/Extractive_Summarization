@entity2 gave two - month - old daughter @entity5 a bottle of organic milk she had bought on the way home from work			1
but within moments the baby was sick and then remained ill for two days			2
photographer and model @entity19 checked the bottle as @entity5 had never been sick before and had been healthy since she was born			1
to her horror she found that the milk she had just given her was from a box of six small bottles whose sell - by date had expired ten months earlier			1
miss @entity2 , who has appeared in @entity29 is @entity30 , said : ‘ you do n’t know what could have been in that bottle			2
‘ they expire for a reason – who knows what harm it could have done ? she is not a sicky baby but she was sick continuously over a 48 hour period			2
i was absolutely disgusted , the bottle was nearly a year old , she was only two - and - a - half months old , it ’s awful			0
‘ it is milk for a newborn , so it could have been so much worse , with an immune system that has no back up			0
it could have been so dangerous			0
’ miss @entity2 said she took @entity5 to her doctor who confirmed her daughter had been made sick by the milk			1
she messaged the @entity59 helpline where staff told her there was nothing dangerous in the product and it could not do any lasting harm to her baby			0
miss @entity2 added : ‘ i rang @entity71 straight after that where i was told to keep an eye on @entity5 and check her throughout the night			1
' she just kept being sick , she was n’t back to her normal self until at least 48 hours later			0
even when i gave her normal milk she refused it			0
’ store : miss @entity2 says she bought the out of date milk from @entity9 's @entity82 store in @entity83 , @entity30 miss @entity2 , from @entity84 , @entity30 , bought the £ 8.50 milk at @entity9 ’s @entity82 store in @entity83 on her way home from an assignment			1
' i was absolutely disgusted , the bottle was nearly a year old , she was only two - and - a - half months old , it ’s awful ' @entity2 she said : ‘ the next day i drove back to @entity9 to take the bottles back and asked for a manager and she simply told me she could give me a refund for it			1
‘ i spent £ 134 in that shop , and around £ 20 for fuel to get there and back because it is an hour away from my home			0
just a refund is unacceptable			0
she filled in a report for customer services and that was it			0
’ a @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ we are taking this matter very seriously and are urgently investigating how this has happened			2

@entity2 fed the organic milk to her two - month - old daughter @entity5
