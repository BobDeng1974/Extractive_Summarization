by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 6:10 pm on 4th october 2011 @entity1 promised a ' better time ahead ' as he acknowledged today that families are suffering difficult times due to the uncertain economic situation			1
the prime minister said the government is taking action where it can to help keep families ' bills down , citing chancellor @entity12 's announcement yesterday of a one - year council tax freeze			1
but he insisted that he would stick to the deficit reduction package of cuts and tax rises			2
' the whole message of this conference is that we know things are difficult , we know families face difficult times right now , but we have got to show the leadership to make the right decisions and get us through this difficult time and get to a better time ahead , ' he told @entity41 's @entity40			1
' i completely understand that families today do see the prices at the petrol pump high , food prices have gone up			2
many people , particularly in the public sector , have had their pay frozen			2
' i understand the difficulty people are going through , so the council tax freeze is helpful because that is one bill that is not going up			2
finishing touches : @entity1 , @entity53 and aid @entity54 go through the prime minister 's keynote speech , which will be delivered tomorrow ' all the time , we are looking to see is there spare money we can use to help @entity29 's families get through what is a difficult time			1
' mr @entity1 told @entity64 : ' people are very worried about future job prospects , and this government has got to do everything we can to reassure them that the difficult decisions we are taking , and i believe they are necessary , are in the long - term interest of the country			1
' the pm insisted it was ' completely unfair ' to say the @entity77 were supporting the rich			2
' overall the richest 10 per cent are going to pay 10 times more tax than the poorest			2
i think this is a fair way to reduce the deficit			0
' calling for responsibility at the top of society , mr @entity1 backed mr @entity12 's plan to tackle tax avoidance			1
the prime minister repeated his chancellor 's vow that the @entity77 would not be moved from its deficit reduction plan ' i want responsibility from people at the top as well as at the bottom and paying your taxes is a key responsibility			1
' mr @entity1 rejected the idea that the government had found more than £ 1billion for extra spending commitments ' down the back of the sofa '			1
and he defended using the money to fund weekly bin collections and a council tax freeze rather than cutting the deficit more quickly			0
@entity108 ( pictured ) came in for praise from @entity1 for his plan to freeze council tax ' when a government is spending around £ 700billion a year it is perfectly possible , through good financial management , to find savings and underspends and use that money wisely , ' he said			1
' with bin collections , i think a lot of families in this country would say " look , the one service i get from my district council is the bin collection and i really would like them to collect the smelly food waste once a week "			2
' i think that is a thing you should expect in a civilised country			0
' i think that is a good use of money by ( communities secretary ) @entity108 , i think the use of money to freeze council tax is a good use of money			0
' mr @entity1 said it was possible to take action on ' people 's priorities ' because the government had been ' very tough on its own costs '			1
mr @entity1 said he did not believe the government should intervene to stop bonuses or put a cap on pay in the banking sector			1
he told the today programme : ' on the question of bonuses , if there is a bank entirely in the private sector , i want to see responsible behaviour and i want to see us regulating properly , but we ca n't determine the pay structure in every single organisation			0
that would n't be the right thing to do			0
' companies do need to attract and retain and recruit good staff			0
i am not opposed to the idea of bonuses			0
i used to work in business , i used to employ staff and negotiate bonuses with people			0
' a bonus on top of what you earn to reward hard work and good behaviour is part of what happens in corporate life and that 's entirely right			0
' mr @entity1 said @entity180 leader @entity179 had gone ' off the rails ' in his conference in @entity183 last week when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones			1
' where i think @entity179 goes off the rails is the idea that the chancellor of the exchequer can sit there and say there is one tax rate for this company and another tax rate for that company			1
mr @entity1 said that @entity179 had gone ' off the rails ' at the @entity180 conference when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones ' it is completely impractical and that is why the business response to the @entity180 conference was so negative , because they thought ' @entity205 above , we are trying to grow an economy and get more people working and we need investment and jobs			1
what on earth is this guy talking about ? '' mr @entity1 challenged mr @entity179 's claim that @entity180 was opposed to the culture of ' something for nothing ' in @entity29 society			1
' i have been saying for five years that if you put into society you should get out of society , ' he said			0
' if you do the right thing , bring up your children , work hard and try to take a role in your community , you should be able to look back on a life and say ' i did the right thing and it was worth it '			0
' the tragedy in our country today is too many people who do the right thing think it 's not worth it because actually they get punished for that good behaviour , rather than rewarded			0
' what i found rather staggering about the @entity180 conference is that they do n't seem to understand that the massive budget deficit they built up was a something - for - nothing deficit			2
' the fact that they have n't tackled all these people on welfare who for years have been able to stay on welfare even though they could work - that was a something - for - nothing culture			0
' the words are great , but what matters in government is are you doing the things to back them up			0
' mr @entity1 insisted that the government was following its mantra that ' we are all in this together ' in paying down the deficit			1
' i do n't accept this is a government that has one rule at the top and one rule at the bottom , ' he said			0
' we are absolutely asking people at the top of our society to be responsible and we are completely dissatisfied about the way the banking industry behaved over the last decade			0

prime minister warns that interest rates would rise if markets lost confidence in @entity29
@entity1 says @entity179 had gone ' off the rails ' in his conference in @entity183 last week
