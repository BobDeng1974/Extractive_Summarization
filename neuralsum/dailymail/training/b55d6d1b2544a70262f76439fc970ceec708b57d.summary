hace n they are already among the most feared predators ever to have roams the planet			2
but researchers now believe that tyrannosaurs hunted in packs - which researchers have dubbed ' a terror '			1
they discovered footprints of tree of the mega-predators in @entity12 , show them mid-hunt			2
the fearsome @entity13 : researcher now say the animal hunted in packs			1
a recent study suggests that the fearsome dinosaur 's walk was hip driven			2
@entity13 lived during the @entity20 - 66million years ago			1
while most people think the carnivorous dinosaur stood upright , it had a bird - like posture and kept its tail in the air and its head pitched forward			1
its massive skull was balanced by its heavy tail , which was around 15 per cent of its body mass. the creature would have changed direction slowly because if its massive inertia but was agile enough to run			2
@entity13 had a top speed of 25mph ( 40kmp ) which is a little slower than a horse			1
the ferocious beasts may have ' stuck together as a pack to increase their chances of bringing down prey and individually surviving , ' study co-author @entity36 , a curator at the @entity37 in @entity12 , told @entity42			1
once believed to be solitary creatures , evidence has grown that tyrannosaurs were more ' gregarious ' than thought , according to @entity36 's study published in the scientific journal @entity49			2
and the fossils are close to perfect , @entity36 said			0
the surface the animals trod was ' pretty much the consistency of @entity54 , ' he said , with a very high clay content			0
that was then covered by a thick layer of volcanic ash			0
conditions were so ideal that impressions of the dinosaurs ' rough skin are clearly visible			0
' this is the most ideal situation you could almost ask for , ' he told the prince george citizen			0
on the run : researchers discovered footprints of tree of the mega-predators in @entity12 , showing them mid-hunt			0
from the size of the footprints , the researchers put the beasts in their late 20s or early 30s the team eventually discovered a patch 197 feet ( 60 meters ) long by 13 feet ( 4 m ) wide filled with footprints from multiple dinosaurs , including tyrannosaurs , other small theropods , and duck - billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs			1
the used @entity84 to show exactly how the animals walked ' one trackway consists of three tridactyl footprints , and two adjacent trackways consist of two footprints each , the researchers wrote			0
' all three trackways show animals bearing southeast within an 8.5 meter - wide corridor			1
' similarities in depth and preservation of the tyrannosaurid tracks indicate that these three trackways were made by track - makers walking concurrently in the same direction			1
' these dinosaurs were apparently walking in the silty sediments from an overflowing river and formed the track marks about 70 million years ago			1
a thick layer of volcanic ash then preserved the marks , @entity36 said			0
in total , the team found seven tracks that were made by three tyrannosaurs			0
though the researchers could n't identify the specific species , it 's likely given the period and location where they were found that @entity116 , @entity117 or @entity118 left the tracks , @entity36 said .			0
