stock image pictured lead researcher at @entity124 , @entity125 , said : ‘ technology is infiltrating pretty much every element of everyday life now , even our sex lives it seems ! ‘ to see that one in three sexual encounters are now digital was surprising , and perhaps a little telling about how people approach sex nowadays			1
no longer do we have to be in the same room , or even the same country , as someone to have a ‘ sexual encounter ’ with them - there are apps to do that for us ! ’ recent research from @entity144 found just over half of adults who have exchanged intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device , despite the fact that one in three do not even have the most basic password protection on their smartphones			1

@entity161 scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘ requisexts ’			0
the research by @entity206 reveals that just as some couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument , the same is true of e-sex and sexts			2
it found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood , while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner			2
