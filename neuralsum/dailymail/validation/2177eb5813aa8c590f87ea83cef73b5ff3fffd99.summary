@entity0 did not need a blinder in @entity2 to confirm his status as @entity6 ’s @entity5 goalkeeper , but serious injuries to his two deputies will revive concerns at the lack of cover available to @entity12			1
@entity13 met with specialists on wednesday after scans confirmed he broke his left knee - cap in @entity18 ’s win against @entity19 on saturday			1
@entity13 will miss the rest of this season and may not play again this year which is a blow for @entity18 as they aim for @entity24 , and also for @entity6 boss @entity12 at a time when @entity26 is out for six months			1
@entity0 talks to the media on wednesday ahead of @entity6 's @entity29 qualifier against @entity30 on friday @entity31 goalkeeper @entity0 makes a save during training at @entity34 with the @entity6 squad @entity26 damaged cruciate ligaments in his left knee while playing for @entity38 against @entity39 12 days ago			1
@entity12 will be exposed if @entity0 is hit by injury or suspension , although the @entity31 goalkeeper has backed the decision to recall @entity45 ’s @entity44 for the first time in nearly three years			1
‘ @entity47 is rock solid , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ his mentality is great			2
and he is a very good goalkeeper who has been playing at the top level for a long time			2
‘ i was gutted for @entity53			0
it ’s really , really sad news			0
‘ it has rocked us all as a goalkeeping group and rocked all the lads in the squad because they are great guys and they are having great seasons			0
‘ but @entity47 has come in and hopefully he can profit			0
he did brilliantly in the @entity62 last year			0
@entity63 ( right ) trains with @entity0 ( centre ) at @entity34 in @entity12 's @entity6 squad @entity13 suffered a knee injury after colliding with @entity19 's @entity67 at the weekend @entity38 keeper @entity26 makes a save against @entity69 in january but is out injured for six months ‘ i remember watching him in the play - off final , when he was man of the match for me			1
@entity45 are in a bad position but he has been fantastic this season			1
’ @entity44 has 12 caps , but only one since the @entity77 in @entity78 when he was pilloried for a mistake which gifted the @entity80 an equaliser as @entity6 drew 1 - 1 in their opening group game			1
he did not play again for @entity83 , and his only game since was against @entity85 , in @entity12 ’s second game in charge			0
@entity88 attempts to nip the ball away from @entity0 's clutches at the @entity91 during the @entity93 tie @entity94 tries to find a way past @entity0 but the @entity6 stopper was in fine form at the @entity91 the @entity99 keeper once again thwarts @entity94 during the @entity93 last - 16 encounter @entity44 , 35 , has not been in the squad since @entity102 despite his reliable form at @entity45 , but will be on the bench for the @entity29 qualifier against @entity30 at @entity106 on friday and probably for the friendly against @entity108 in @entity109 on tuesday			1
@entity110 , 22 , has been promoted from the under 21 squad			0
he has been capped once at senior level , in a friendly against @entity108 in @entity114 in 2012 , but he has had little first - team action this season			2
@entity110 played six times during a loan spell at @entity119 and has played five cup games for @entity39 , where he has been unable to oust @entity122 international @entity121 since signing from @entity123			0
others who might come into @entity12 ’s thinking are @entity126 , who also has one cap — as a half - time substitute for @entity110 in that @entity130 game — and is enjoying a good season in the @entity62 with @entity132 , and @entity133 at @entity19			2
@entity133 is at least playing regularly in the @entity134 , where 75 per cent of the goalkeepers are foreign			0
@entity110 ’s step up leaves under 21 boss @entity138 with two championship goalkeepers — @entity140 , 21 , understudy to @entity142 at @entity143 , and @entity144 , 22 , who has recently broken into the @entity146 team			0
some experts believe the next keeper to emerge as a serious challenger to @entity0 will be @entity31 and @entity150 keeper @entity151 , 19 - year - old son of former @entity153 international @entity152			1
@entity0 will win his 50th cap in @entity108 on tuesday , if he plays in both these international games , and is still only 27			1
he could play at the top for another decade if he can stay fit — @entity12 will pray that he does — and that would bring @entity159 ’s record of 125 @entity6 caps into range			2
@entity159 was 31 when he played his 50th game for @entity6 but went on until he was 40			1
‘ it ’s exciting , 50 caps would be an amazing milestone , but i want to get there first , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we have two games and we ’ve seen recently that you never know what ’s going to happen			0
i just want to push on and earn my right to keep playing for my country			0
@entity159 was 31 when he won his 50th @entity6 cap , while @entity0 could win his against @entity108 next week ‘ i want to be here for as long as i can , but there are plenty of other @entity99 goalkeepers who want to be in my place and i ’m going to have to be at my very best to keep that position			1
’ @entity69 defender @entity180 on wednesday night withdrew from the squad with hip and hamstring problems			0
@entity184 was called up by @entity6 after @entity186 ’s @entity185 withdrew on saturday			2
but the left back has now been sent back to his club with an injury of his own			0
with @entity191 and @entity192 already in the squad , @entity12 has decided not to call up a replacement .			0

@entity18 keeper @entity13 has *undergone* *surgery* on his knee
@entity26 is also out injured as @entity6 lack *options* in goal
@entity45 keeper @entity44 has not represented @entity6 in almost three years
three @entity203 face @entity29 qualifier against @entity30 on friday
@entity6 keeper @entity0 could gain his 50th cap against @entity108 next week
