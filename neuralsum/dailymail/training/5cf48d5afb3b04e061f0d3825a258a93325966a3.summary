@entity0 gave an assured display at the heart of @entity4 's midfield			1
check out his heat map and all the match stats here in the 82nd minute , a large , white paper aeroplane floated down the considerable distance from @entity10 ’s third tier and struck @entity11 , a @entity12 substitute playing at full - back , on his right shoulder			1
it drew the most heartfelt cheer of the night			0
skill like that you do n’t see every day			0
the rest of it , we ’ve sort of seen before			0
the most famous @entity22 visitor to these shores took to hanging about antiques shops in @entity25 and kept marmalade sandwiches under his hat , so it is fair to say not a huge amount was expected of @entity4 's opponents and they did not disappoint			2
@entity12 turned in enough skilful , enterprising play on the counter early on to pose a gentle threat , followed by some woeful defending of set - pieces that afforded @entity4 two second - half goals from corners , and a scoreline with emphasis			1

it will not be this easy in @entity109			0
the @entity110 back four have seen the odd inswinging corner and , first of all , you have to get up their end of the field to win it			0
on this evidence , what progress @entity4 do make in that direction will be painstaking , to say the least			2
the energy levels grew as more players with a point to prove — those not in the starting line - up — were introduced , but if this was a dry - run for @entity4 ’s tempo in the heat of @entity128 , ‘ slow and steady wins the race ’ seems to be the motto			1
@entity4 ’s first group game with @entity133 is the shortest price for a 0 - 0 draw of any fixture in the tournament , and with good reason			1
still , a party with a happy atmosphere was the demand and @entity4 will depart for @entity109 via @entity62 this weekend , smiling			1
there was music , a bit of @entity147 wave - style dancing and some games with planes kept the guests amused when the sporting fare failed to satisfy			0
towering : @entity65 doubled @entity4 's lead , connecting with @entity68 ' corner to power a header home three lions on a shirt : @entity65 beams after doubling @entity4 's lead no mistake : @entity66 fired home through a crowd of bodies to put @entity4 on easy stret queuing up to score : @entity66 reacted first in a crowded box to put the gloss on victory double act : @entity65 and @entity66 kept a clean sheet and both got on the scoresheet whether this @entity4 team will fly quite as gracefully once the serious stuff begins is another matter entirely			1
still , a win is a win , and there is nothing wrong with @entity68 showing his worth from corners as he did on two occasions once captain @entity0 had surrendered his duties on leaving the field — or @entity44 finding his range from outside the area , as he did in the first half			1
@entity44 ’s goal , coming after 32 minutes and much needed after a turgid opening , was the true highlight of the night			1
the chance of finding a back four in @entity109 quite as prone to bouts of narcolepsy , however , is unlikely			0
@entity64 took a quick throw - in on the right , and would have been delighted to find the two nearest defenders in repose and in no position to stop @entity44 receiving the ball and turning towards goal			2
he was forced out to just beyond the penalty area by the one @entity22 paying attention but it was not diversion enough			0
@entity44 sighted the target and hit a lovely left - foot shot that curled away from goalkeeper @entity53 , who is not the most imposing presence , it must be said			2
lift - off : @entity0 and his team - mate applaud the home fans after a satisfying result at @entity10 a big hand : @entity63 was called into action several times but kept @entity12 at bay the goal gave @entity4 the breathing space required and @entity12 ’s defence did the rest			1
it might have been different if a 35 - yard shot from @entity94 , who has spent the past year on loan at @entity216 , had dipped an extra six inches nine minutes into the second half but it did n’t and @entity12 ’s threat then passed			1
their best spell had come in the first half when @entity63 saved another deflected shot from @entity94 and then kept out @entity92 with his feet , but @entity12 were nifty without being greatly intimidating			2
they were chosen for this purpose , one supposes , and served it well			0
it may be that manager @entity39 instructed his squad to imagine this was a stifling night in tropical @entity128 and to play at a tempo conducive to saving energy in heat and humidity			2
we can only hope so			0
if not , @entity4 need to find several gears if they are to make any impression on the group in @entity109 , let alone the tournament			2
no matter the conditions , a certain rhythmic level is required and @entity4 lacked it for long periods			2
it is not a good sign when the biggest cheer is provoked by paper missiles , or when the first successful throw on to the playing area instantly inspires hundreds of distracted imitators			0
on the front foot : @entity76 plays the ball as the @entity4 playmaker stretches the @entity252 special moment : @entity254 made his @entity4 debut , replacing team - mate @entity68 in the 75th minute terrifying pace : @entity75 came on in the second - half and produced some trademark bursts of speed pain game : @entity92 winces after coming off worse in a challenge with @entity74 on friday night caught out : @entity56 slips while trying to evade the attentions of @entity86 sadly , all that was proven for much of the night is that @entity4 ’s flyers are as inconsistent as their footballers : the very occasional score enlivening a rather ordinary succession of failures			1
having said this , a good set - piece will always win matches , even in the most rarefied atmosphere , and @entity4 are taking a weapon of sorts to @entity252 in the shape of @entity68			1
it was the @entity279 man who picked out @entity65 in the 65th minute for a thumping header that gave @entity4 a two - goal cushion and dispelled any hope of a @entity22 revival			1
the marking was ordinary and it always helps when the man guarding the far post would need a pogo stick to reach any header steered towards the top corner , but @entity12 ’s shortcomings are not @entity4 ’s responsibility			1
there was a degree of fortune with the third , however , the entirely unconvincing @entity53 dropping what should have been a simple gather , the ball clipping @entity65 ’s head on the way down and falling to @entity66 who prodded it smartly through the hapless goalkeeper ’s legs			1
job done : @entity39 replaced skipper @entity0 with @entity70 looking up : @entity74 skips past @entity91 as @entity4 launch an attack watching brief : the @entity4 bench observe proceedings at @entity10 plenty to ponder : @entity39 named a strong team , including @entity74 , for the final game on home soil before the @entity309 by royal approval : prince @entity41 is flanked by @entity312 chairman @entity311 and @entity314 chief executive @entity313 @entity53 then collapsed to the floor as if injured — his pride more than his body , one suspects			1
the usual regiment of substitutes invaded towards the end , but we are well and truly in phoney war territory now			0
@entity39 says that he has not made his mind up on the team , but performances in training are as likely to influence a final decision as any match — unless a player turns in a performance of extremes , either positive or negative			2
there was nothing at either end here			0
@entity4 did what was expected , but need to step it up this summer			0
they walked from the field accompanied by a blast of @entity338 , no doubt intended to make those gathered think optimistically of summer in @entity343			0
let ’s hope the team are better prepared than the fellow in charge of the soundtrack .			0

@entity44 gave @entity4 the lead after 32 minutes with a fine *individual* strike
@entity65 and @entity66 added the gloss in the second half to seal a comfortable home win
@entity4 head to @entity62 on *sunday* for two more @entity309 warm - ups against @entity360 and @entity361
@entity39 *praised* the fans for their @entity10 send - off
@entity12 were skilful and enterprising and @entity4 found them tough to break down
