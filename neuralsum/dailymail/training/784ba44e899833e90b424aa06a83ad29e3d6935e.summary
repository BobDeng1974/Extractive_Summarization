by @entity1 reporter published : 07:04 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 20 march 2013 what do all these classic film scenes have in common ? they all involve weapons			1
or at least they did			0
a new internet craze has seen movie fans trying to doctor film history by replacing guns with something altogether more positive - a thumbs up pose			2
the images suggest that some of @entity16 's most recognisable characters , from @entity18 's @entity17 to @entity20 's @entity19 , should have swapped their weapons for something more encouraging			0
laid back : @entity23 adopts a casual thumbs up pose positive : one of the pictures , posted on blog @entity27 , shows @entity30 's @entity29 ditching his gun for a thumbs up say hello to my little thumb : @entity35 as @entity36 in the climatic scene of @entity38 thumbing a lift : @entity41 's @entity40 appears slightly less psychotic posing without his gun in @entity45 's @entity44 yippee : @entity48 cop @entity47 , played by @entity49 , appears without a gun - something of a rarity @entity53 fighter : fighting crime in @entity55 with a simple message seeking revenge : @entity20 's @entity19 sought revenge with his gun in @entity60 's @entity59 @entity61 : the infamous image from @entity17 has been given a slightly less threatening quality peace : terminator adopts a pose more often seen in @entity68 's election campaigning but despite the message of pacifism encouraged by the posts , film buffs will be left scratching their heads as they are forced to look upon the scenes in a completely different way			1
in one picture , ultra cop @entity47 , played by @entity49 , is seen bracing himself for a testosterone - fuelled exchange			2
but the gun - toting policeman 's semiautomatic has been erased , instead showing him giving an enthusiastic double thumbs up			0
elsewhere , a collection of film hard men , such as @entity29 and @entity68 's @entity84 , have also been stripped of their customary guns			1
it 's all ok : @entity87 and @entity88 in @entity60 's @entity89 hands solo : @entity90 in @entity91 muscle man : he 's got the expression of a tough guy but @entity95 is just happy in 2011 movie @entity97 thumb war : a doctored scene from @entity100 this scene from the @entity103 ' @entity102 approached in a different manner dude : another @entity103 ' classic @entity105 shows @entity106 as @entity107 without his weapon @entity109 in @entity110 without facing aliens with his thumb @entity47 makes another appearance this time with a double thumbs up @entity115 in the closing scene of seven even @entity117 , @entity95 's ultimate tough guy and @entity119 , have adopted the universal sign			2
the posts were gathered on the blog @entity27 , having been doctored by internet users			0
the blog 's tagline informs users that ' real tough guys do n't need guns , they just need a positive , can - do attitude '			1
underwater : @entity131 in @entity133 's @entity132 with @entity132 @entity134 and @entity135 carrying a little less threat maybe @entity138 's @entity137 is possible with a thumbs up @entity49 in @entity140 in a loving embrace			0
