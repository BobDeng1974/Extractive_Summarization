by @entity0 this feels like a homecoming to @entity3			1
his heart had long been set on a return to @entity7			2
pretty much , it seems , from the moment he left in 2011			2
for all that longing , @entity3 could never have imagined what would happen to the club between his second and third spells as an employee			1
the bitter experience of administration and slumping to the foot of the league ladder has been followed by almost incessant turmoil off the field			0
even now , with the club just one step short of climbing back into the top flight , uncertainty still lingers			1
video : scroll down to see @entity3 's on rejoining @entity7 for a third @entity29 spell homecoming : @entity3 has returned to @entity7 after penning a one - year deal the club ’s board and a section of its support have spent the summer at loggerheads over season - ticket renewals , with the exact uptake yet to be made public			1
the financial situation is regarded by most as fragile yet that did not put off @entity3 in the slightest			1
even at 34 , he would not have been short of other options - but @entity7 was the only interest he pursued			0
insisting he did not seek any assurances over the club ’s future , @entity3 ’s only concern is what could happen on the field of play as @entity51 ’s side seek to gain promotion from the @entity53			1
‘ i ’ve not sought anything , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m here to play football			0
if things happen off the field then i ’m sure i ’ll have to deal with it like everybody else at the club when that happens , but hopefully it wo n’t			2
goal machine : @entity3 has netted 67 times for @entity7 during his first two spells ‘ hopefully , we wo n’t get back to the situation we have found ourselves in before			1
for me , i wanted to come back to this club to play football , pull that jersey on and get out in that stadium in front of these fantastic fans again			1
i am fortunate enough to have that opportunity			0
‘ any time i meet anyone and speak about @entity7 it ’s always , one , am i coming back ? and , two , they would like to see me back here			2
‘ the chat has always been about football and not what ’s happened off the field or what ’s going to happen off the field			0
‘ it ’s all been about getting this club back to where it belongs , which is challenging at the top			1
’ asked if the speculation about @entity7 ’ off - field health might dissuade other players , he added : ‘ that ’s every footballer ’s prerogative but it was never an issue for me			0
i wanted to come back no matter what ’s gone on			2
feeling at home : @entity3 is back for a third spell at @entity29 ‘ i want to play for this football club and i ’m just delighted that it ’s done now			1
if anyone else has reservations then that ’s up to them			0
’ for @entity3 , signing his contract earlier this week completed ‘ a long , long process of trying to come back ’ , after previous possibilities were wrecked by a whole variety of circumstances			1
the question now is whether he will be the only @entity29 old boy to return this summer			0
@entity51 is also thought to be keen on @entity111 , out of contract at @entity113 and attracting interest from both @entity115 and @entity116			0
it remains to be seen whether a deal for the 30 - year - old can come to fruition , but @entity3 would be more than happy to renew their previous partnership			1
‘ i think @entity111 would excite everyone , when you see what he brought to the club in the four - and - a - half years he was here , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ he scored an incredible amount of goals			2
‘ that ’s what he does			0
last season he scored 22 league goals for a struggling @entity113 team , which is phenomenal			2
‘ i ’ve spoken to @entity111 and i think that , if the opportunity was there , it ’s something he would be interested in			0
‘ personally , i ’m just happy to be here and i ’d like to thank the chief executive and the manager for giving me that chance			0
back where he belongs : @entity3 has returned to @entity141 from a spell in @entity143 with @entity144 ‘ whoever comes in or whoever i ’m asked to play alongside up front , i ’ll be delighted to do it			1
just pulling on that jersey again will be enough but if the big man comes back he will definitely be an asset for the club			1
’ pulling on a darker blue shirt again remains unlikely			0
@entity3 retired from @entity141 duty last year to concentrate on his club career with @entity144 and to limit the number of draining transatlantic flights			1
those travel concerns are no longer present , but he feels @entity158 has plenty of more youthful options to spearhead a push for @entity163 qualification			0
‘ you ’re spot - on that my decision to stop playing for the national team was largely down to those flights , ’ admitted @entity3 , capped 69 times			1
‘ it was hard for me to do that travelling and still perform at optimum levels for my country , and also to go back to @entity143 or the @entity173 and then be fully fit to play for my club the following saturday			1
‘ that was really tough and , ultimately , it was a big part of my decision			0
now that i ’m back i ’ve no thoughts about coming out of that retirement and making myself available for selection			1
‘ @entity141 ’s results in the last year have been excellent and i hope that we continue to make progress under @entity158			0
‘ we have a lot of fantastic younger boys available to play in my position and i ’m sure we have more than enough to make sure that we ’re challenging for a place at @entity163			0
’ his focus will , therefore , be on a demanding domestic challenge with @entity7 pitched in alongside @entity189 and @entity190 in a second tier unlike any other in the past			0
club before country : @entity3 has no plans to come out of retirement and add to his 69 caps for @entity141 @entity3 is confident that it will bring the best out of the existing @entity29 squad			1
how long it will take for the club to be restored to the top flight - winning force he once knew is a different question			2
‘ who knows ? ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the first aim this year is to win this league and get back into the top flight			2
‘ after that , we know what this club ’s about - winning trophies			2
there is not going to be any thinking that we ’ve got a couple of years to get back in contention			2
‘ we need to be challenging straight away , it ’s as simple as that			0
that ’s what the players will be looking to do			0
‘ how long it will take , who knows ? but i know for a fact that if i am here next year and we are in the top flight , there ’s no way i will be settling for second best			0
