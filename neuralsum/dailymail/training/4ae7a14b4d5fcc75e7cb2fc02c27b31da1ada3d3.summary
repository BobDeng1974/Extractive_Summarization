by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:15 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 4 february 2013 bank customers will be given more powers to demand a better deal under plans unveiled by chancellor @entity6 today			1
people will be able to switch accounts in just a week if they find a better deal elsewhere			1
and the time it takes to transfer money and clear cheques will also be cut as mr @entity6 vowed to take on the ' oligopoly ' of a handful of banking giants dominating the market			2
reckless banks will be allowed to go to the wall so taxpayers never have to bail them out again			1
in a speech at the @entity22 offices of @entity21 , mr @entity6 said 2013 will be the year when the banking system is ' reset '			2
he said he wanted to see banks ' working for their customers , not themselves ' as he set out the government 's @entity41			1
the chancellor promised to make it easier to switch accounts in just a week , and in future it should be quicker to transfer money and clear a cheque in a bid to promote better competition between banks , from september customers will be able to walk into their bank and simply demand for their account to be transferred to a rival			1
mr @entity6 said : ' we ’re going to give customers the most powerful weapon of all : choice			0
' crucially , the bank will be obliged to transfer a customer ’s direct debit payments to the new account – ending the weeks of hassle associated with changing accounts now			1
that will allow people to shop around and get better interest rates , forcing banks to offer better deals for customers to keep them			1
consumer watchdogs repeatedly complain that new customers are wooed with attractive rates of interest , while existing customers are left languishing on low rates			0
the system of wiring money between banks will also be overhauled , to stop it being dominated by a few big players			0
the ring fence between high street banks and high risk investment arms will be ' electrified ' so if a bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank mr @entity6 said : ‘ why , in the age of instant communication , do small businesses have to wait for several days before they get their money from a credit or debit card payment ? it should be much quicker			1
‘ why do cheques take six days to clear ? customers and businesses should be able to move their money round the system much more quickly			0
‘ why is it that big banks can move their money around instantly , but when a small business wants to make a payment it takes days ? ’ the chancellor said he would ring - fence high street operations from the reckless ‘ casino ’ investment arms that caused the financial crash			1
in future no bank will ever again be ‘ too big to fail ’ , he said			0
‘ when the @entity116 failed , my predecessor @entity115 felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out , ’ he said			1
‘ not just the @entity116 on @entity123 ’s high streets , but the trading positions in @entity125 , the mortgage books in sub-prime @entity121 , the property punts in @entity126			0
‘ i want to make sure that the next time a chancellor faces that decision they have a choice – to keep the bank branches going , the cash machines operating , while letting the investment arm fail			2
‘ no more rewards for failure			0
no more too big to fail			0
no more taxpayers forking out for the mistakes of others			0
’ the @entity139 today published a bill to prevent taxpayers ever having to shoulder the burden of bailing out fat cat bankers			1
this will : vow : mr @entity6 said when the @entity116 failed , his predecessor @entity115 felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out the legislation published today implements some of the recommendations of the @entity149 led by sir @entity150			2
it is the result of a compromise deal between mr @entity6 and business secretary @entity153			0
the bill will also contain plans drawn up by @entity156 , the @entity157 chairman of the @entity158 , to ‘ electrify ’ the ring fencing of investment operations			1
that means that in future , if an individual bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank			1
the chancellor said the previous regulatory regime – set up by @entity170 and @entity171 – failed to prevent the last crisis			1
‘ the fire alarm was ringing , but no one was listening , ’ he said			0
‘ and when the crisis hit , the fire was then so great that the whole economy was sacrificed to put it out			0
the @entity123 people need to know that lessons have been learnt			0
’ mr @entity6 acknowledged the level of anger among voters that bankers appear to have got away scot free despite wrecking the economy			0
but he will also argue that @entity123 needs a stable and effective banking system to help families and businesses and that bashing the banks will not achieve that			2
@entity116 will be forced to slash staff bonuses to fund a multi-million pound fine for rigging interest rates			0
the 81 per cent taxpayer - owned bank will this week be docked around £ 500million for its role in fiddling @entity195			2
mr @entity6 has told the bank the portion of the fine paid to @entity121 regulators , likely to be around £ 400million , should come from bonuses			0
@entity201 , chief executive of the @entity202 , warned the threat to break up banks this would make it more difficult for banks to raise capital to lend to businesses and would also create uncertainty for investors			2
he said : ‘ no other major economy is considering moving away from the universal model of banking because it undermines banks ' ability to provide all the services businesses need			2
‘ above all , what banks and business need is regulatory certainty so that banks can get on with what they want to do , which is help the economy grow			2
’ @entity224 claimed the reforms did not go far enough			0
shadow chancellor @entity171 said : ‘ for all the rhetoric and the partial climbdown he has been forced into , @entity6 is still failing to deliver the radical banking reform we need			1
' he has refused to repeat @entity224 's tax on bank bonuses or implement our legislation on pay transparency			0
and he has failed to get the banks to lend to businesses , with net lending to small firms falling month by month			2
’ choice : customers will be able to switch accounts between banks more quickly bank customers will be able to switch accounts with ease under new rules hailed as a revolution for consumers			1
currently , it takes 10 working days to switch an account from one bank to another , but this will be cut down to five in the autumn			0
ministers have rejected calls for customers to keep the same account numbers because they feared it hold - ups would have made the process much longer and put people off moving their accounts			1
as well as making it easier to move accounts , the government plans to speed up the process of transferring money between accounts held at different banks			1
officials are said to be outraged at the fact that it takes up to three days to pay money from one account into another , and point out that even in relatively poor countries such as @entity279 such transfers take no more than 24 hours			0
the chancellor also confirmed plans to encourage new banks to open up , increasing competition on the high street .			1
