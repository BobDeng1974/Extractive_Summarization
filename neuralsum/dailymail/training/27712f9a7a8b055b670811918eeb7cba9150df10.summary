the boss of one of the polling firms trying to predict the outcome of the independence referendum today admitted they might have it completely wrong			1
in recent weeks the polls have narrowed to suggest the result is on a knife edge , with the latest poll of polls giving the @entity11 campaign a 51 per cent to 49 per cent lead			1
but @entity13 , director of @entity14 , has admitted he fears the unique background to the vote means polling data may have been corrupted , exposing the industry to its ‘ @entity19 ’			1
mr @entity13 admits he believes the actual result could see a much more comfortable victory for either side , and drew comparison with the 1992 general election , when the polls had @entity46 set for a victory only for @entity48 to win			1
he told @entity49 : ‘ this referendum has the potential to be a polling @entity19 , the biggest since 1992 when the polls got it wrong			1
‘ i think and hope that the best that we in the industry can hope for is that we dodge a bullet , but it ’s entirely possible the bullets do start spraying our way			0
‘ we are dependent on a pot of people which is defined , but we do n’t know how big it is and in my view it wo n’t be big enough			0
the most recent @entity14 survey for the @entity67 gives the @entity28 campaign a lead @entity13 , director of @entity14 , who has warned scottish independence referendum polls could be totally inaccurate ‘ in that lies a real danger for the accuracy of the polls			1
’ the latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results , but suggest the result is too close to call			2
a @entity80 survey for @entity81 put no on 50.6 per cent and yes 49.4 per cent			0
a poll by @entity83 gave the no campaign an eight - point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an @entity87 survey in @entity88 put @entity89 on 53 per cent and yes 47 per cent			2
however , a surprise @entity14 poll for the @entity67 put the @entity28 campaign eight points ahead , on 54 per cent , although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people			1
more than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307 - year - old @entity98			0
experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent			0
better together leader @entity101 insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead , but he suggested half a million people in @entity105 have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck			1
a surge in @entity28 voters may not have been picked up by the polls because a lot of the support has come from people who do not normally vote , and so are not likely to have been polled			1
of the six companies that are polling , four use online panels , one does face - to - face canvassing and another does phone interviews			0
figures showing @entity28 support might be underestimated because young voters are less likely to sit down to answer online questions , or stop in the street and speak to canvassers			2
they are also less likely to have their own phone line and therefore are missed by polling using that method			0
it is believed the no figures could be inaccurate because of so called ' shy @entity89 ' who are afraid of letting people know they are against independence			0
with the @entity28 campaign being so rooted in @entity105 nationalism , many no voters are concerned that it can appear unpatriotic to be against @entity105 going alone			2
this means that when asked the question by a pollster , a no voter may say they are undecided or even that they are going to vote yes , out of fear they will appear unpatriotic			0
however , these ' shy @entity89 ' have every intention of voting against independence in the privacy of the polling booth , so the real figures of no voters could be much higher .			0

polls show the @entity28 and @entity11 campaigns neck and neck
most recent ' poll of polls ' has no support ahead at 51 per cent to 49 per cent
but @entity14 director @entity13 warned polling data may be seriously wrong
mr @entity13 : ' this referendum has the potential to be a polling @entity19 '
