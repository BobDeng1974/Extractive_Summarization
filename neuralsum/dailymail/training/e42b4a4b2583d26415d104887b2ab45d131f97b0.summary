you get excited over the discovery of a vintage coat or pretty vase in a charity shop			1
but one treasure hunter has come across an ancient @entity7 seal that could be more than 3,000 years old , among people ’s discarded junk			1
archaeologist @entity10 , who paid just £ 12 ( $ 19 ) for the seal on a charity website , believes it bears the cartouche of @entity15 , who ruled @entity7 between 1,279 and @entity16			1
this image shows the seal , left and the impression it makes , right , meaning the hieroglyphs read as they should in @entity7 hieroglyphs , a cartouche is an oval with a horizontal line at one end , indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name			1
he came across the ancient artefact while trawling the website of a charity shop in @entity37			1
the carved stone has hieroglyphs carved into one side that can be used as a seal , and a scene on its reverse , showing a man sitting down with an eagle over his head and a scarab beetle at his feet			1
mr @entity10 , who also works as a television presenter , believes that it is the scene that makes the object so unusual – and he has sought the opinion of experts to work out just how rare his £ 12 ( $ 19 ) find is			1
the seal still has traces of red ochre as well as grains of sand embedded deep inside the carved lines of the object			1
‘ as the cartouche is the royal seal of @entity15 then it is plausible that the figure seated could be that of @entity66 himself ( illustrated in a cast relief depicting the pharaoh hunting )			1
this is a real mystery at the moment but an exciting one nonetheless , ’ mr @entity10 said the carved stone piece has hieroglyphs carved into one side , which could be used as a seal and a scene on its reverse , showing a man sitting down and an eagle over his head and a scarab beetle at his feet			1
further analysis is needed to try and work out whether the man is @entity15 @entity15 , was king of @entity7 from 1279 to 1213 @entity80 and is also known as @entity15 ‘ the great ’			1
he ascended the throne as the third king of the @entity83 at the age of twenty - five			2
it ’s thought that during his 67 year reign , he built more temples and fathered more children than any other pharaoh			0
he founded a new capital , @entity91 and built temples throughout @entity7 and @entity93			2
the most famous of these buildings is the @entity95 , cut into rock , and ‘ the @entity97 ’ – his mortuary temple at @entity99			0
the tomb of his principal wife , @entity101 , is one of the best preserved royal tombs and the resting place of some of his sons has recently been uncovered in the @entity107			0
‘ the hieroglyphics on the flat face of the stone should be able to be translated in the coming weeks telling us more about the history of the stone , ’ he told @entity108			0
‘ as [ it seems that ] the cartouche is the royal seal of @entity15 then it is plausible that the figure seated could be that of @entity66 himself			1
' this is a real mystery at the moment but an exciting one nonetheless			0
’ sometimes amulets were given in the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs , as a symbol of good luck			2
such items are often important to archaeologists for dating the tomb and its contents			0
they were also regularly worn by pharaohs and the oval surrounding their name was meant to protect them from evil spirits in life and in death			0
@entity7 believed that individuals who had their name recorded , would not disappear after death			2
mr @entity10 said : ‘ the stone is in the form of an @entity7 funerary stele - a kind of tombstone			1
‘ the front of the stone depicts a pharaoh seated below the wings of @entity152 [ whose ] wings [ are ] offering protection as the pharaoh passes into the afterlife			0
mr @entity10 , a television presenter who is pictured left next to @entity158 , believes that it is the scene that makes the object so unusual – and he has sought the opinion of experts to work out just how rare his £ 12 find is , as well as what the inscription says @entity15 founded a new capital , @entity91 , and built temples throughout @entity7 and @entity93			1
the most famous of these buildings is the @entity95 , cut into rock ( pictured ) and ‘ the @entity97 ’ – his mortuary temple at @entity99 ‘ alongside him is carved a cartouche of a scarab beetle and the transformation into the sun - a symbol of rebirth in the afterlife			1
‘ could the seated pharaoh be that of @entity15 ? ’ he asked			1
based on the condition of the stone , mr @entity10 thinks it shows signs of being buried in sand			0
he has also found traces of red ochre , which was used by the ancient @entity7 as a form of paint			1
‘ the seal also has some slight traces of wax in the carved faces indicating that it may have been used to add a seal to documents , ’ he said , adding that more analysis of the object is needed			2
mr @entity10 spotted the seal on a charity website , noting that it had not had much interest from other prospective buyers			2
before purchasing it , he looked into its age and importance			0
‘ i researched the hieroglyphics as a starting point and found that they are the royal cartouche of @entity212 , ' he said			2
while the seal was on display in the shop , it came to his attention on the charity 's website , which sells ‘ almost anything from clothes to jewellery ’			1
earlier this month , mr @entity10 purchased a ' garden ornament ' in @entity224 which has an intricate pattern likely carved in @entity227 times			2
he said the pattern ‘ may be some form of writing , ’ although there are so far no suggestions about what the ' text ' or shapes may mean			0
mr @entity10 found the stone while he was looking for interesting stone carvings to buy on an auction website			0
' as i immediately recognised just how important it could prove to be i just had to purchase it to save it from ending up in another garden or even thrown away at worst , ' he said			0
it weighs around 60lbs ( 27kg ) and is wider at the base than at the top			0
earlier this month , mr @entity10 purchased a ' garden ornament ' in @entity224 ( pictured ) which has an intricate pattern likely carved in @entity227 times the relief work does not resemble any known text , however , but the shape and style of the rock is typical of @entity227 monumental art. he told @entity108 : ' regarding the carvings on the stone my initial feeling is that these are symbols rather than straightforward text			2
' mr @entity10 suggested that the stone could be ‘ a keystone from an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling			0
’ he also tweeted that the stone could be the base of a cross or a tombstone			0
mr @entity10 believes the stone dates to the @entity270 period , which stretched between 410 and @entity271			0
the period is known for its intricate patterns , which appeared on buildings and jewellery , for example , as well as written literature such as the poem beowulf			0
however , the date is only a guess and he has asked his @entity281 followers for help in learning more about the mysterious stone .			0

a scene showing a seated man , bird and a scarab beetle is on the reverse
experts are *assessing* whether the £ 12 find is rare and *valuable*
