@entity1 's love of spinach is born out of one of history 's easiest mathematical errors			0
a mathematician and scientist has revealed that spinach 's iron content was miscalculated by a @entity11 chemist when he misplaced a decimal point			1
his mistake gave birth to @entity1 's obsession with the vegetable , which the cartoon character eats in vast quantities to boost his strength			2
@entity1 's testimony that he is ' strong to the finish , ' cause i eats my spinach ' is apparently born from a mistake 50 years before he became popular			0
@entity26 misplaced a decimal point when recording his research , making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality			1
this caused the popular misconception that spinach is exceptionally high in iron , which makes the body stronger ... a myth that cartoon character @entity1 ( pictured ) helped to spread @entity39 talks about how scientific errors can lead to popular myths in his book , ' the half - life of facts : why everything we know has an @entity47 '			1
in 1870 , @entity11 chemist @entity26 was researching the amount of iron in spinach and other green vegetables			2
when writing up his findings in a new notebook , he misplaced a decimal point , making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality			1
while mr von @entity26 actually found out that there are just 3.5 milligrams of iron in a 100g serving of spinach , the accepted number became 35 milligrams thanks to his mistake			1
this caused the popular misconception that spinach is exceptionally high in iron , which makes the body stronger			1
if the value was true , eating a generous serving of spinach would be comparable to munching on a small piece of paper clip			0
the story goes that cartoon creators aware of spinach 's miraculous health properties had the idea that @entity1 should eat spinach to increase his strength			0
it is believed that the cartoon character is responsible for boosting consumption of spinach in the @entity84 by a third			2
the incorrect calculation of spinach 's iron content contributed to the creation of popular cartoon character @entity1 , according to a book by mathematician and scientist @entity39 while mr von @entity26 's error was spotted and corrected in 1937 when someone re-checked his maths , spinach is still popularly thought to be one of the most iron - rich vegetables , perhaps helped by the cartoon character			1
in 1981 , the @entity99 published an article to try and debunk the spinach myth			0
mr @entity39 uses the @entity1 story to illustrate how humans have a tendency to ignore re-examining evidence and admit when we are wrong			0
he said that the reason such errors spread and lead to well - believed myths are because it is easier to spread a ' fact ' that sounds correct than to delve deeper			0
