it could be the ultimate in male vanity - men are paying thousands of pounds in search of the perfect nipple			1
plastic surgeons are creating smaller , flatter nipples for male patients			2
some men have their nipples made smaller during surgery to tidy up loose skin left after extreme weight loss			1
others are have it done while having their ' moobs ' , or male breasts , reduced			0
@entity16 has the ' perfect , almond - shaped nipple ' according to the @entity18 but some are so worried about the state of their nipples that they go under the knife solely to have them altered			1
they pay up to £ 2,000 for this – and spend up to a fortnight recovering			2
the revelation come from a surgeon who has researched the shape of the ideal male nipple			0
@entity28 , of the @entity29 , asked 62 volunteers to study topless photos of 100 men and say which had the most desirable nipples			2
some of the models were ordinary males who worked in the hospital , others were body - conscious gym goers			0
both sexes plumped for symmetrical nipples that were small , flat and slightly darker than the surrounding skin			1
the ideal nipple is also round or almond - shaped , the @entity18 of @entity44 annual conference heard			1
in case you are wondering , @entity16 , apparently , has perfect almond - shaped nipples			1
@entity50 , of @entity51 is @entity52 , has poster - boy round nipples			1
more men are opting for £ 2000 surgery to achieve small , flat , round nipples like @entity16 's dr @entity28 's study also showed that women are more put off than men by nipples that protrude			1
the surgeon , who does private as well as @entity63 work , does around 40 nipple reductions a year			0
most of these are in men whose nipples seem to large after extreme weight loss or after surgery to remove their ' man boobs '			2
but some are in men who are simply anxious that their nipples are too big			2
these men are often body builders who have compared their chest to other men in the gym			0
dr @entity28 said : ' for many years , cosmetic surgery was associated with women and men would n't even talk about it			0
they thought it was too vain			0
' but now , men say : " if i can have something to make me look better and i can afford it , i will do it			0
" ' the view has changed			0
' those ca n't afford the £ 2,000 , or are squeamish about the 45 - mintue op , have another option			1
the study showed that a sculpted chest can often more than make up for nasty nipples			0
dr @entity28 said : ' a well - toned torso will make people accept a nipple that is less than ideal			1
' they are distracted by something more important to look at			0

more men are opting for ' moob ' or nipple surgery costing up to £ 2,000
