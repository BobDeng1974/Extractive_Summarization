four @entity1 consultants who resigned from the @entity5 in @entity6 last month , have written an open letter to the trust branding it a ' disgrace ' and claiming they were put under ' unbearable pressure ' ' this is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all @entity1 staff			1
' the situation has taken a heavy toll on our personal and family lives - the stress has been unbearable at times			2
' we are battle - weary and exhausted by the continuous pressure that we have been under			0
' we can no longer see a way forward to secure safe and sustainable @entity1 services at the @entity5 especially whilst the current senior management and senior clinical leadership remains in place			1
' the consultants also say they invested years of work into maintaining patient care but felt decisions made by the trust 's management had ' undermined ' services at the hospital			1
' these in turn have led to the self - fulfilling prophecy of failing and unsustainable services , ' they said			0
they added that they feared resources were ' heavily weighted ' in favour of people in @entity62 at the expense of patients in nearby @entity6 who use the @entity5			1
they also said they had raised concerns several times but believed they had not been listened to and felt they had no choice but to resign			0
the letter is not signed by the fifth consultant , who worked at the @entity73			1
the @entity74 has published a 720 - word response in which it said they were ' disappointed ' the consultants had not recognised the pressure the trust was under			2
a statement read : ' we are disappointed that our ed colleagues have not acknowledged the serious challenges to @entity15 services in this area that drove the need to review and reconfigure key medical services â€“ changes that are essential to improve patient care across the entire county and beyond			1
' on the same day a consultant at nearby @entity11 also resigned			2
the @entity74 said it is disappointed the doctors did not recognise the pressure the @entity15 services in the area were under it added : ' unfortunately , recruitment efforts for years have failed to improve the shortfall of medical staff at the @entity5 , and this is predicted to cause potential risks for patients in the future			1
' this means that some clinical departments need to be reorganised			0
such decisions are never taken lightly			0
' change , even when essential for patient care , can be difficult and inconvenient for staff , but facts need to be faced and will not be altered if we fail to confront them			1
' it would be better if the consultants had stayed to work with the trust to support the development of emergency services for the whole county			2
' the consultants ' letter praised the team they worked with in the emergency department at the @entity5			1
' we have built a unit which is recognised for good patient care and excellent training , ' they said			1

' we would like to thank all of our @entity1 staff who have given us their unfailing support and loyalty over the years and helped us to build a quality service			0
' all of them should be justly proud of their achievements which we and the patients have benefited from			0
' we would also like to thank the many trainees , staff and patients who have made such kind comments over the last few difficult days - we have all been greatly moved			0
' the @entity143 told @entity144 it is in discussions with a number of potential partners to replace the @entity1 team			0

' we have received offers of support from a number of individual @entity1 consultants and from neighbouring trusts and we are now in discussions with various people as we seek to ensure continuity of service			2
' a trust spokeswoman said it has taken the decision to publish in full on the website , both the consultants ' letter and the response from senior colleagues			2

the @entity74 has commissioned the @entity182 to lead an independent review to investigate allegations around bullying and harassment			0
