by @entity0 @entity1 is a sensitive soul			1
when the sun 's shining she 's happy as a dog with two tails , but when it 's raining ... well , let 's just say , the world is not her favourite place			1
' i suppose my life is dictated by my moods , ' she says			1
' when it 's raining and it 's a sunday and it 's horrible , there 's that feeling of , " @entity17 "			1
i 'm not good at pulling myself out of it			1
i have to wallow in it so i hide in my kitchen and cook			1
if i feel something , i feel it 100 per cent			1
if i feel sad , i feel really sad			1
if i 'm happy i bounce about			1
' thankfully , actress - turned - cookery expert @entity1 , 41 , is in a bouncy mood when we meet			1
i guess her ' really new , really lovely ' relationship with @entity28 's @entity27 judge @entity26 has something to do with it			1
they 've been seeing one another since last october , two - and - a - half years after @entity1 won the 2010 series of celebrity master - chef and began working in @entity26 's posh @entity36 restaurant @entity34 of @entity37 ( which he 's since sold )			1
happier now : @entity1 has come through ivf and a failed relationship ' when i met @entity26 he was a judge on a show i loved and i was petrified of him			1
he was brilliant and gave us all tips so you did n't want to let him down			1
all i could think was , “ that sauce has n't worked			1
” i did n't see anything but food for three months			1
after i won , we did @entity48 and stuff			1
@entity26 and i always got on , but i never thought about me and him			1
' quite rightly too , for they were both married with young children			1
@entity26 , 48 , separated from @entity52 , his wife of four years and the mother of his eight - year - old son and six - year - old daughter , at the end of 2011			1
@entity1 's marriage to actor @entity60 , with whom she has an adopted daughter @entity61 , seven , ended in april last year			1
which leads me to the tricky bit ... look @entity1 , you 're a lovely girl ( she is ) and a joy to meet ( ditto ) , but we know how steamed up kitchens can be			1
are you honestly saying this really - new - really - lovely relationship was n't simmering away before your respective marriages ended ? ' absolutely not , ' she says			1
' it never crossed my mind			1
@entity26 and @entity73 were friends			1
neither of us thought of it as anything else until ... ' until ? ' i do n't know how things change , but something does			1
he asked me on a date			1
we went out for dinner			2
then it was slightly different			2
' slightly ? ' i 'm really , really happy			2
@entity26 and i are having such a nice time but we 're taking things slowly			1
there are lots of other people to consider			2
' including her daughter @entity61 ? she nods			1
' @entity26 and i were friends			1
neither of us thought of it as anything else until ... ' @entity61 was 15 months old when she was adopted after @entity1 had endured three failed @entity97 attempts			1
' the other day @entity61 was bouncing on the trampoline with a friend and i heard the friend say something about , “ when you were born was your mummy really big ? ” @entity61 said , “ my @entity104 had me			1
my mummy adopted me so she 's my @entity106			1
i did n't grow in her tummy			2
i grew in her heart			2
” ' @entity1 has tears in her eyes as she tells me this			2
' both @entity60 and i really wanted to be parents			2
going for adoption is very , very tough , but i did n't want to get to 40 - something thinking , “ i 've spent everything on @entity97			2
i ca n't do anything else and i 'm past the time i can adopt. ” i thought , “ i want to be a mother and , whatever it takes , i will be a mother			2
” ' @entity60 was completely on the same page from day one			2
there are a lot of reasons you separate			2
it 's rarely just one thing			2
i suppose the @entity97 was a huge strain			2
there are so many drugs flying around your body and you 're on this mission to get pregnant			2
you spend so much money			2
you 're injecting yourself in the loos and you 've got bruises all over you			2
mentally there 's all those highs and then loss			2
most people have a child at the end of it , so think , “ i 've got this , which makes it worth it			2
” for a long time i did n't have anything to make it better			2
' after adopting i was at home for a year			2
it was very strange going back into that world of telly			2
' @entity1 began acting at 19 in the film @entity158 after leaving school at 16 to model			0
roles in @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 followed			0
' for a year you 're defined by talking about babies then you go back into the real world and think , “ who am i ? i do n't know who i am			0
” ' we worked very hard to make our marriage work and it did n't			0
but we have a friendship that works with @entity61 and that 's everything to us			1
it 's not her fault we could n't make it work			0
my daughter is my number one priority			1
' new romance : @entity1 with @entity26 we 're here because @entity1 has written her second recipe book , @entity182 … , which features @entity61 throughout			1
' cooking anchors me and calms me , ' she says			0
' whenever life throws its curve balls i gravitate towards the kitchen , but i never knew i was any good at cooking			0
when i won @entity27 , i found i was good at something i loved			1
cooking for me is about moods			0
i find i want to cook different things at different times			0
' the @entity192 … includes recipes for ' when the sun is shining ' , ' on a rainy day ' , ' for family and friends ' and features a recipe for @entity26 's @entity198			1
' the food thing is a massive connection with @entity26			1
to be able to talk about food , to love it , to be able to go out and eat and ask questions is amazing			0
' her love of food comes from her mother @entity207 , who died of throat cancer when @entity1 was just 16			0
she was a talented amateur cook who inspired @entity1 's first best - selling cookbook recipes from my mother for my daughter , published last year			1
' last year was difficult			0
things were not happy and i had this thing about being 40 ' ' @entity104 was ill for nearly two years and for a long time i was very angry about it			0
i was 15 , 16			0
suddenly i 'd discovered boys			0
i was at a girl 's school			0
i just wanted to go and have fun like all teenagers do			0
now i think , “ why was i so awful ? ” but of course you do n't think somebody 's going to die when you 're a teenager			0
' i 'm very like my mother in that she was an open book			0
you 'd know the minute she came in and the door slammed she was in a bad mood			0
when she was fine , she 'd close the door gently , say “ hi guys ” and it was like the sun had come out			0
when she died it left me with a lot of guilt			0
i thought i was the worst daughter in the land			1
' actress turned property expert : @entity1 was crowned @entity27 2010 it 's the first time she 's talked about her mother with such honesty			1
i suspect her happy relationship with @entity26 has a lot to do with it			1
he lost his mum when he was four			0
' i was talking to somebody the other day and they said , “ once you can cope with losing your mum you can cope with anything			0
” i 'll never , ever go through a day like the day she died again			0
it was the worst day ever			0
' i remember saying goodbye to her to go to school			0
she was asleep and she squeezed my hand , but i did n't go to school			0
i was with my boyfriend and my poor father was driving around trying to find me			0
when i went home my grandparents were there and my grandad told me			0
i went upstairs to see her			0
' @entity1 is in tears			0
' it 's funny how something will always , always affect you			0
' last year was difficult			0
things were not happy and i had this thing about being 40			0
@entity269 died when she was 44 so in my head i was thinking , “ when did it first start happening ? could this be my last happy year ? maybe i 've got three happy years left			0
” now i want to get past 44			0
for a long time i did n't see myself doing that			0
my dad said , “ you 're crazy			0
” i 'd say , “ but i ca n't see past it			0
” but now i can			0
' i do live by my moods , but the sun does come out eventually			0
for now i 'm having a really happy time and it 's lovely not to be dreading autumn for the first time in years - really lovely			0
