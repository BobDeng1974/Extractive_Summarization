by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 15 february 2013 ' troubling case ' : mr @entity2 granted an injunction preventing the baby from being removed from the care of the health manager social services tried to take a baby girl away from an adoptive mother after they discovered she had been blinded by a brain tumour operation			1
the woman returned from hospital to find a social worker on her doorstep , ready to make a judgement on the child ’s fate			1
today a high court judge stopped social workers from removing the baby until there is a full court decision , calling the case ‘ troubling ’			0
he also criticised the unnamed @entity26 council that had tried to take the baby away			0
mr justice @entity27 said the local authority had failed to look into the would - be mother ’s state of health , to offer her any support to bring up the child while disabled , or to consider that the baby now ‘ finds her home ’ in the woman ’s arms			1
the baby girl , named in court only as @entity39 , was born 13 weeks premature in february last year , weighing only 2lb 4oz , and with a cleft palate			1
she was abandoned by her mother and spent many months in hospital before being placed with the adoptive mother , a single woman who works as a project manager for the @entity45			1
at the end of last year , the woman was diagnosed with a brain tumour after she found her sight deteriorating			1
leaving the child to be cared for by friends , she went into hospital where the tumour was successfully removed in surgery			2
but the woman was left without sight and it may never return			2
in court : the single health manager began legal action at the @entity59 when a local authority tried to remove a one - year - old baby from her care after she lost her sight she returned from hospital in january to find the social worker waiting on her doorstep			1
mr @entity2 said in a ruling published yesterday that the council ’s decision to take the baby away from the woman was based on the opinions of the social worker formed on ‘ the very day when she was discharged from hospital after her operation ’			1
he added : ‘ one can only imagine the tumult of emotions which she must have been feeling on that day – joy and relief to be at home and with the baby ; sickening anxiety and possibly despair at her new disability			0
’ the judge said the social worker had noticed the year - old baby bat the woman ’s face with her hands when the adoptive mother failed to notice her expressions			1
the social worker wrote this was ‘ a small indicator of the difficulties she is most likely to face in her efforts to build an attachment with @entity39 ’			0
shortly afterwards the council told the woman the child would be removed , threatening her with criminal prosecution if she failed to co-operate			2
in his ruling , the judge said the baby should remain with the adoptive mother for now and that her treatment by social workers was unfair			2
he added : ‘ visual impairment does not of itself disqualify an adult from being a capable loving parent			0
‘ the ability of the woman to provide good emotional care for @entity39 needs to be properly assessed			0
‘ it was not fairly assessed when the social worker visited the woman ’s home so soon after her discharge from hospital			0
’ the judge said that the council had not offered practical support to the woman , despite her requests for help			0
he said she depends on her friends to cope with the baby , adding : ‘ whether this is indeed the optimal long - term care arrangement for @entity39 remains to be seen			0
’ he advised the council to provide the support she has asked for , saying that a care assistant or nanny to help her may be the best option .			0
