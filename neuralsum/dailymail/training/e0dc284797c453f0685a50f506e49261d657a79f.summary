@entity0 has announced that it is selling 9,000 bowls of porridge a day it sells a lot of sushi wraps , coconut water , kale crisps , wild crayfish with rocket sandwiches and double berry muffins			1
but nothing is more popular at @entity0 , the healthy fast food chain , than something which is a lot simpler and more traditional			1
its bestselling product last year was just a bowl of porridge , the company said yesterday			1
@entity0 said its £ 2.35 ‘ porridge pots ’ were its bestselling item last year , selling more than 3.2million pots in the @entity20 , equal to around 8,800 every day			1
with just 243 calories in each 300g pot - compared to 616 calories in its @entity25 - its porridge is also one of its more slimming options for breakfast			1
@entity0 has only been selling porridge since 2010 , and its popularity has surged recently			1
sales rose by ten per cent last year , compared to 2012 , even managing to beat the previous bestseller - bananas - into second place in the 2013 league table of @entity0 ’s most popular foods			1
such is its enthusiasm for porridge that it has specially trained ‘ porridge chefs ’ to make its breakfast bestseller			2
it is stirred ‘ gently but continuously ’ until it is cooked to avoid lumps , and must be removed immediately from the heat when it is ready to stop it from becoming too gloopy			0
the revelation comes after porridge has seen a huge surge in popularity as a healthy alternative to sugary and expensive breakfast cereals			2
it is said to be the regular breakfast choice of celebrities and politicians from the prime minister , @entity57 , to @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
after the @entity63 bombings in 2005 , the former prime minister , @entity61 , is said to have turned down a three - course lunch at the @entity65 in favour of a bowl of porridge served with cream and @entity70 - laced raspberries			2
traditionally , the @entity71 would have eaten porridge in its purest form , made with hot water with a pinch of salt for taste			0
sales in @entity0 jumped by 15 percent last year to £ 510 million today porridge is often just a useful vehicle for a large pool of maple syrup , a mountain of brown sugar or a generous portion of cream			1
@entity0 offers two free toppings for their customer ’s porridge pots - a berry compote or honey			1
honey is the most popular option , it said yesterday			0
a recent report , by the retail analysts @entity93 , found the value of porridge sales have nearly doubled over the last six years to nearly £ 250million a year			1
medical research has shown that oats are important for the diet because they help to reduce the level of blood cholesterol , which is associated with clogged arteries			0
a warming bowl in the morning is also a relatively cheap and good source of slow release carbohydrates which helps people to feel full and maintain energy levels			0
it is possible to buy a 1kg pack of porridge oats for as little as 75p while a 1kg box of @entity112 costs £ 3.39			0
overall , @entity0 said it sells more cold - pressed vegetable juices , such as carrot juice , than @entity117 sandwiches			1
the ‘ classic ’ is made from chicken , bacon , tomatoes , salad and mayonnaise			0
its financial results , published yesterday , show annual sales jumped by 15 per cent last year to £ 510million in the year ending on 2 january			2
in 2013 , it opened another 40 new shops , including 26 in the @entity20			0
the other 14 were in @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 , raising its total number of shops worldwide to 352			0
@entity0 was opened in 1986 by two former surveyors , @entity136 and @entity137 , who said they were fed up with not being able to find a decent sandwich at lunchtime			2
a few years ago , it was criticised by the former employment minister , @entity141 , after one branch in @entity63 appeared to be staffed entirely by foreigners			0
at the time , he said : it is certainly a situation that i find unacceptable			0
of course , this country has benefitted from people coming in from other countries to work			0
‘ but i want to see more young people in positions in this country and i want ... to see them getting jobs that become vacant , rather than people coming into the @entity20			0
’ yesterday @entity0 said it created 600 new jobs worldwide last year , and has doubled the size of its @entity20 school leavers programme to 18 people .			1

@entity0 sold 3.2 million pots of porridge during 2013
sales of the popular breakfast *snack* *increased* by 10 percent last year
the 300g pots contain just 243 calories - less than half of a breakfast roll
