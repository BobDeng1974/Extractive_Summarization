@entity1 has the highest percentage of female millionaires in the world , a report has found			1
women make up less than a quarter of the country 's fat cats ( 23 per cent ) , but it 's still way above the @entity9 , which boasts only 5.9 per cent			1
while @entity13 fares better than some , with 11.4 per cent of @entity13 millionaires being female , it still comes in behind countries such as @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity1 has the highest percentage of female millionaires compared to men - 23 per cent the @entity24 is revealed to have just 9.4 per cent , @entity25 9.2 per cent , @entity26 8.8 per cent , while @entity27 has 8.5 per cent			1
the league table , compiled by @entity29 and wealth consultancy company @entity30 , shines a light on gender inequality in terms of individual wealth			2
@entity36 countries , such as the @entity37 6 per cent , @entity9 5.9 per cent and @entity38 on 6.3 per cent , fare surprisingly badly			0
@entity39 and @entity40 take the two bottom places , with 3.8 per cent and on 3.7 per cent respectively			1
@entity1 - 23.8 per cent @entity42 - 21.0 per cent @entity43 - 18.3 per cent @entity44 - 18.0 per cent @entity45 - 17.4 per cent @entity9 - 5.9 per cent @entity46 - 5.7 per cent @entity47 - 5.3 per cent @entity39 - 3.8 per cent @entity40 - 3.7 per cent @entity48 , editor of @entity50 's magazine , says : ' the top ten most equal countries for multimillionaires are a diverse bunch and almost certainly not the ones you would have predicted			1
' it certainly seems that @entity56 is leading the way in gender equality , perhaps reflecting emerging markets whose developing , increasingly wealthy economies are not bound by old forms of gender discrimination in business			0
' he adds : ' there are also surprises about the least equal countries for multimillionaires , although some are obvious : in @entity39 , women can only work in jobs which do n't bring them into contact with men , which obviously stifles economic opportunity			0
@entity56 is leading the way in gender equality , perhaps reflecting emerging markets whose developing , increasingly wealthy , economies are not bound by old forms of gender discrimination ' countries like the @entity9 , @entity37 and @entity38 we might well assume had a fairer distribution of wealth with their liberal politics and diversified economies , so it is surprising to find otherwise			0
' it is worth remembering , of course , that women make up over half the global population , so we ca n't really say any country is gender - equal until its wealth is divided much more along those lines			2
what is shocking is that no country is anywhere near that yet			0
' according to @entity102 of @entity30 : ' there seems to be no correlation between emerging and developed countries in the top 10 female multimillionaire countries			0
' however , if you consider that @entity44 and @entity20 are home to many of emerging @entity56 's multimillionaires , it appears that most of the top 10 countries are in fact emerging markets			0
this is a startling realisation when you think that it is @entity118 countries leading the way in promoting gender equality			0
' the research also shows that the @entity13 sits 15th in the world and 10th in @entity123 in terms of its percentage of female multimillionaires ( 11.4 per cent )			1
@entity48 adds : ' according to the @entity128 , female entrepreneurs make 20 per cent more revenue with 50 per cent less investment , so helping women into business is good for us all			2
