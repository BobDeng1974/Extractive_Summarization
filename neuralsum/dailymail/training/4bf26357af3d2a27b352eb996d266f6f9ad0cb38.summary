@entity66 in @entity4 where @entity117 will hold her landmark birthday party with her family stunning views : the family will have the use of this open - air dining gazebo at @entity66 in @entity4 guests have only to walk a few feet from their garden to snorkel in the crystal - clear @entity87 in front of the house family : this year 's trip has seen the @entity132 and @entity8 travel as a family with their son exclusive : the beautiful island of @entity4 is a popular spot for the jetset and is privately owned with its sugar - sand beaches and gently swaying palms , it 's no surprise that the @entity81 has proved a hit with holidaying royalty			1
a particular favourite is @entity145 , which earlier this year saw princess @entity146 arrive on its shores for a break			0
part of the @entity152 , the island is one of four that make up the @entity155 , and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as @entity158 's , a beachside restaurant just outside the capital @entity161			0

home : another royal to love the island was princess @entity171 who owned a home there while celebrities are certainly seen here , it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot			0
‘ all of that makes it perfect for the royals , who can enjoy the island ’s relative privacy and lack of “ riff raff ” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach , ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere			0
' almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of @entity4 , which in january last year , was the scene of @entity11 's first ever trip abroad			1
while the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his @entity1 relatives and will do so again this year , his great aunt @entity171 , another royal fond of a @entity4 break , sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island			1

famed for its pristine beaches and upmarket watering holes , the island is one of the most exclusive destinations in the world			0
