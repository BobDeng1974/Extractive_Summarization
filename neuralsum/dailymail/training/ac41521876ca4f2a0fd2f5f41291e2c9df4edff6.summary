outraged : many are threatening to quit farming altogether rather than spend cash on what they call ' millimetre madness ' about a third of the 9.5 million pigs reared in this country each year live indoors on concrete slatted floors			1
for more than 20 years , the gaps between the slats have been governed by a @entity2 industry standard that has stipulated an opening of three - quarters of an inch ( 19mm )			2
these gaps are vital for hygiene			0
but a new @entity38 directive set to come into force next january has decreed that the maximum size of a gap should be reduced to 18mm			1
animal welfare chiefs in @entity5 believe this will stop pigs catching their trotters and suffering injuries			1
safety : animal welfare chiefs in @entity5 believe the new directive will stop pigs catching their trotters in gaps and suffering injuries but farmers and vets say there is no evidence that pigs are being hurt			1
and they add that a narrower gap could hamper the cleaning of the sheds and leave pigs in dirty conditions , which could cause infections			1
urgent talks are now being held between the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) and @entity66 , @entity67 and farming minister			0
concerning : urgent talks are now being held between the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) and @entity66 , @entity67 and farming minister @entity65 chairman @entity70 said : ‘ we are worried that farmers will fall foul of the law if they are 1mm out			0
what we need is a pragmatic solution			0
’ about 800 of @entity2 ’s 2,500 commercial pig farmers could be affected , although the @entity65 is conducting a survey to establish a more accurate figure			0
on average , if each farmer had to replace the flooring in a shed for 1,000 animals , it would cost £ 35,000 , giving a total bill of £ 28 million			1
@entity85 , 49 , from @entity86 , @entity87 , has a herd of 80,000 pigs			1
he says the new rule would land him with a bill for £ 120,000 – and that he would quit pig farming rather than pay to have the work carried out			0
mr @entity85 said : ‘ it is another part of the ridiculousness that is @entity5			0
if we had a problem with our slats , we would have a lot of lame pigs and that is not the case			2
everyone i ’ve spoken to thinks it ’s mad			0
’ dr @entity105 , a pig spokesman for the @entity106 , said straw bedding could become trapped in the smaller gaps			0
