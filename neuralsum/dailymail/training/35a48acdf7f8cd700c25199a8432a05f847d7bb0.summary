two @entity3 midwives who refused to take any part in abortions because it would ' violate their conscience ' can not object to helping with terminations , the @entity1 's highest court ruled today			1
@entity11 @entity10 workers @entity8 and @entity12 argued they are entitled to refuse to order , supervise or support staff or patients at any point during the abortion process on religious grounds			1
the @entity18 opposes all abortions , even if the pregnancy is the result of a crime or puts the mother in danger because all life is sacred , including that of an unborn child			2
but the @entity10 and midwife groups said that the right to object - beyond the midwives ' right to refuse to abort the child themselves - compromised care for patients			1
landmark case : catholic midwives @entity12 , left , and @entity8 , right , demanded the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures but the @entity41 has ruled that this can not happen in a seven - year court battle the @entity11 midwives were backed by the @entity45 in @entity46 who agreed they could conscientiously object to taking any part in terminations			1
they agreed that the right of conscientious objection ' extends not only to the actual medical or surgical termination but to the whole process of treatment given for that purpose '			0
2007 - @entity3 midwives @entity8 and @entity12 became concerned at a decision to move all medical abortions to the labour ward at @entity60 , @entity61			1
as labour co-ordinators and midwives they had previously registered their conscientious objection to taking direct part in abortions , as allowed under the @entity67			2
2012 - ms @entity8 and ms @entity12 argued their supervision and support of staff involved directly in terminations amounted to ' participation in treatment ' and breached their human rights			1
judge @entity77 at the @entity45 found the pair were sufficiently removed from any involvement to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs			0
ms @entity8 and ms @entity12 appealed the decision			1
april 2013 - @entity46 court 's @entity84 overturned the decision and allowed the midwives to be completely separated from any part of the process november 2014 - @entity41 hears an appeal brought by @entity61 and @entity90			2
december 2014 : five judges rule that @entity61 and @entity90 's appeal should stand			0
but today five justices at the @entity41 in @entity94 allowed an appeal by a health authority in @entity11 against them			1
the health board argued that conscientious objection is a right only to refuse to take part in activities that directly bring about the termination of a pregnancy , not the support and care process			1
@entity107 , lord @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 unanimously allowed the appeal today			0
the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) and @entity115 ( bpas ) had warned of the implications for services if the @entity45 decision was allowed to stand			0
the ' landmark ' ruling was welcomed by the @entity114 and bpas			0
in a statement the two bodies said they intervened in the case because they believed ' such a broad and unprecedented interpretation of conscientious objection , applicable across the @entity1 , would effectively have enabled a tiny number of staff opposed to abortion to make women 's care undeliverable in many @entity10 settings '			1
@entity133 , chief executive of bpas , said : ' we welcome this ruling			0
@entity115 supports the right to refuse to work in abortion care , not least because women deserve better than being treated by those who object to their choice			1
' but the law as it stands already provides healthcare workers with these protections			0
extending this protection to tasks not directly related to the abortion would be to the detriment of women needing to end a pregnancy and the healthcare staff committed to providing that care			2
' there are enough barriers in the way of women who need an abortion without further obstacles being thrown in their way			0
' ruling : it has taken seven years of court fights before the abortion case made it to the @entity41 in @entity94 , pictured , the highest court in the land @entity164 , @entity114 director for @entity11 , said : ' this ruling is sensible and both women and midwives will welcome it			1
' the ruling gives extensive definition to complex clinical and other situations , in regard to whether conscientious objection applies or not			0
the @entity67 allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in direct involvement in abortion care , provided it is not an emergency case			2
catholic midwives and labour ward co-ordinators , @entity8 and @entity12 argued their objection should extend to supervising , delegating and support their colleagues who were directly caring for women having had terminations			1
the @entity113 and the @entity10 argued that it would set a precedent that could ' compromise patient care ' ' midwives and other clinicians will benefit from this ruling 's clarity and women will be able to continue to exercise their choice over their reproductive rights			1
' the case before the justices centred on the scope of the right to conscientious objection under the @entity67 , which provides that ' no person shall be under any duty ... to participate in any treatment authorised by this @entity67 to which he has a conscientious objection '			0
last april 's appeal victory for the two women followed a ruling against them in 2012 in their action against @entity61 and @entity90			0
in the previous appeal ruling in favour of the women , @entity211 , with @entity212 and @entity213 , said : ' in our view , the right of conscientious objection extends not only to the actual medical or surgical termination but to the whole process of treatment given for that purpose			0
' after that decision , ms @entity8 and ms @entity12 said the ruling affirmed the rights of all midwives to withdraw from a practice that would ' violate their conscience '			1
the women were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at @entity60 in @entity61			0
at the time of the original ruling , ms @entity8 had been absent from work due to ill health since march 2010 and ms @entity12 had been transferred to other work			2
senior : the women were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at @entity60 in @entity61 both registered their conscientious objection to participation in pregnancy terminations years ago , under the @entity67 , but became concerned when medical terminations were moved to the labour ward in 2007			0
they said being called upon to supervise and support staff providing care to women having an abortion would amount to ' participation in treatment ' and would breach their rights under the @entity252			2
in the original ruling against them , the judge , @entity77 , found that the women were sufficiently removed from involvement in pregnancy terminations to afford them appropriate respect for their beliefs .			0

midwives @entity8 and @entity12 wanted no part in abortions
this included ordering them or supporting staff or patients involved
they argued as @entity18 being involved would ' violate their conscience '
@entity10 and @entity113 said it would compromise patient care
@entity11 courts backed women but @entity41 in @entity94 ruled against
case means staff can not refuse to offer care before or after termination
but *nursing* staff retain the right not to carry out the abortion if they object
