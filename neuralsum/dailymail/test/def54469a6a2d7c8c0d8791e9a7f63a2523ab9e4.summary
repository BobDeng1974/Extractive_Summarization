they were young men from stable families who believed they were stuck in dead end jobs and looked on with jealousy at the flashy lifestyles of others who had girls , money and fast cars at their fingertips			1
what @entity10 , then aged 21 , and @entity12 , 24 , came to have in common was the belief that smuggling drugs would provide them with a short cut to the life of ease and glamour and - their biggest mistake - that they could get away with it			1
thirteen years since their fateful first meeting , after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected , the ringleaders of the infamous @entity25 , who were caught trying to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin out of @entity28 , are now dead			2
but a glance at their working - class backgrounds would never have led anyone to predict their dismal fate			0
@entity10 , the youngest of four children and the son of @entity61 immigrants , once described himself as the black sheep of his family			1
he worked as a supervisor for the catering company @entity65 , where he first met @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , who he would later recruit into the drug smuggling roles that landed them in various @entity28 prisons			1
@entity12 , a university drop - out and the eldest of three , still lived with his parents while working in a mail room			1
the @entity25 trials began in october 2005 at @entity77 district court : top row ( from @entity80 ) @entity12 , @entity10 and @entity81 , 2nd row ( from @entity80 ) @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity68 , and 3rd row ( from @entity80 ) @entity78 , @entity86 and @entity66 both men , who first met at a party in 2002 despite attending the same @entity90 high school , had one thing in common ; they were disillusioned by their jobs and had been won over by the riches and lifestyle that selling drugs promised			1
' i do n't think i was really going anywhere in life			0
i do n't think , you know , i was achieving too much , even though i had a stable job and all â€¦ i was a drug user , ' @entity10 told @entity101 in a 2010 interview in which @entity12 also admitted : ' i did n't see myself working in the mail room for the next 50 years of my life '			1
he continued : ' i thought " no , i ca n't do this " , then you see all these people like in night clubs with nice @entity108 , and nice @entity109 and there 's always chicks there , and they was buying drinks for everyone and you think " f * * * " , how do you do this on a mail room salary '			2
both men were arrested on april 17 in 2005			2
@entity10 was intercepted at @entity120 along with @entity78 , @entity86 , @entity121 and @entity67 who had heroin strapped to their stomach and legs , while @entity12 was found at the @entity127 hotel on @entity128 with @entity84 , @entity129 and @entity68			1
the latter were found with 334g of heroin along with materials for smuggling including @entity134 , scales and plastic wrap			2

pictured : @entity78 ( left and right ) with heroin strapped to his stomach and legs after being arrested @entity66 is pictured being searched by police			0
the latter group were found with 334g of heroin along with materials for smuggling including @entity134 , scales and plastic wrap it 's difficult to imagine the two men , now in their 30s and swearing by their rehabilitation , as the gangster thugs that threatened the lives of their drug mules			1
although the @entity28 courts concluded that it could not be proven , @entity78 and @entity121 both claimed that @entity10 had threatened their families ' lives if they did not follow his orders			2
meanwhile prosecutors accused @entity12 of being uncooperative and having no remorse for his actions , making it all the easier to push for the death penalty			2
by october , the trials had begun for the @entity25 at @entity77 district court and within just five months on february 14 in 2006 , @entity10 and @entity12 were sentenced to death by firing squad			1
@entity67 , @entity86 , @entity121 , @entity84 , @entity129 , @entity68 and @entity78 meanwhile , were given life in prison during trials between february 13 and 15			0
however by the 17th , all of them had appealed their sentences except @entity78 , marking the beginning of a long battle with prosecutors as their verdicts wavered between death and life in prison			0
although the @entity28 courts concluded that it could not be proven , @entity78 and @entity121 both claimed that @entity10 had threatened their families lives if they did not follow his orders it 's difficult to imagine the two men , now in their 30s and swearing by their rehabilitation , as the gangster thugs that threatened the lives of their drug mules @entity66 is the only @entity25 member who was given a reduced sentence of 20 years , while the other six ( @entity10 and @entity12 excluded ) were sentenced to life in prison			1
@entity197 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) finally in 2011 , @entity78 was the last of the smugglers to be sentenced to life in prison along with five others			0
@entity66 is the only @entity25 member who was given a reduced sentence of 20 years			0
all seven are now waiting out their sentences from inside various @entity28 jails scattered around the country			0
@entity10 and @entity12 's death sentence on the other hand , would never budge			1
an initial appeal of the death penalty was rejected by the @entity210 high court in april of 2006 at a time when @entity50 's prime minister at the time , @entity212 , refused to interfere			0
a second attempt , this time requesting for a judicial review in august 2010 , were supported by prison officials who attested to their rehabilitation			0
@entity10 , covered in tattoos and gold jewellery upon his arrest , had transformed into a devout @entity222 minister ordained by the @entity223 in @entity224			2
all seven are now waiting out their sentences from inside various @entity28 jails scattered around the country			0
they fought a long battle with prosecutors as their verdicts wavered between death and life in prison several trips : panel beater turned drug mule @entity66 made two successful trips for @entity10 from @entity210 with heroin strapped to her body , but was caught on the third , in april 2005 , and sentenced to 20 years former @entity241 bartender , @entity67 ( left ) and @entity90 catering worker @entity68 ( right ) , pictured at @entity242 , @entity210 , in 2007 , two years after they were duped by @entity10 who had promised them quick riches by acting as heroin mules in @entity210 skumaran meanwhile , had obtained an @entity247 in @entity248 from @entity249 in @entity250 and became known for his haunting paintings			1
both organised and ran various classes , including @entity253 and art classes , for their fellow inmates and spoke out in media interviews about their lengthy imprisonment and how they reflected on their past with regret			0
both judicial review requests were rejected by july 2011 , leading the duo to appeal for presidential clemency from @entity28 's then president @entity264 in the following year			0
but a two year long wait amounted to nothing as both men had their pleas reject by @entity269 , who was elected in july of 2014 and by december had announced his hard - line stance on drug smugglers			0
the first four months of 2015 has proved to be a complete nightmare for @entity10 and @entity12 and their families			1
handcuffed and shackled , @entity10 cut a bleak figure as he was transferred from @entity210 to @entity276 and a prison cell on ' @entity278 ' @entity280 despair was etched on @entity12 's face as he was led away to be transferred to nusakambangan where he is due to face the death penalty it began with the rejection of their clemency and the announcement that they would be amongst those next executed			1
in the following months judicial reviews were rejected , legal appeals failed along with appeals against the refusal for clemency and prisoner swaps were refused as the men 's lawyers mounted a new case in the constitutional court			0
the pleas of @entity50 prime minister @entity302 , foreign minister @entity303 and the @entity304 of @entity50 , dr @entity305 , fell on deaf ears as mr @entity269 repeatedly made his stance on drug smugglers clear - there would be no mercy .			0
