the @entity0 will allow as many as 60 women to participate in the next @entity3 course , allowing women for the first time to compete in the grueling two - month combat school			1
it is considered one of the first steps into the military special operations field			0
army secretary @entity11 approved the change that would allow women in the course beginning in late april			0
his decision marks the latest move in the @entity17 's push to open as many combat jobs possible to women			1
currently about 900 of the military 's approximately 1,000 occupations are open to women , but the toughest ones remain closed to them , including infantry , armor and special operation jobs			1
pre-ranger : sgt. @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , 3rd @entity31 , crosses the finish line during the 25th @entity33 in @entity34 while completing the leadership course would let women wear the coveted @entity3 tab , it does not let them become members of the @entity3 regiment			1
currently only men can be in the @entity42 â€” the special operations forces unit based at @entity44 , @entity45			0
joining the regiment requires additional schooling that is physically , emotionally and mentally challenging			0
women and men preparing for the @entity3 course will be able to participate in a 16 - day training and assessment school that would train women on some of the infantry and combat skills that they would not already have			1
infantry jobs are not currently open to women			1
the @entity3 school includes three phases			1
the first 20 days focus on military skills and endurance			2
the second is a mountain phase that includes more small - unit operations and survival techniques and the final , so - called swamp phase takes place in @entity66 and includes airborne assault , amphibious operations and extreme mental and physical stress			0
@entity70 , the @entity17 's director of officer and enlisted personnel management , said on thursday that opening the ranger school to women was the ' next logical step , ' as the department continues its review of all jobs across the military to see if they can be open to women			1
and , as the year goes on , she said each step will inform the next , so the experiences of the women in the ranger school will be examined and used as examples as other job openings are considered			2
she noted that some women are already serving in a few specific jobs linked to units of special operations forces			2
mainly those are women in logistics , administrative or psychological operations posts at the headquarters level			0
strongest women : staff sgt. @entity95 , @entity96 instructor , teaches a class on the proper emplacement of a @entity100 mine at the @entity101 but one woman is now a member of the elite 160th special operations aviation regiment , known as the @entity104			0
the @entity104 may be best known for flying the helicopters that took @entity106 into @entity108 's compound in 2011			0
that unit was also the one most often named by @entity0 women as the combat job they 'd like			1
while less than 8 percent of the women who responded to a survey last year said they 'd want a combat job , more than 30 percent of those who did , named the @entity104 as their top choice			0
the 160th is a specialized unit used to fly forces fast , low and deep behind enemy lines under cover of darkness			0
about 17 women worked in the unit in administrative , intelligence and logistics posts , as of last year			0
also , there have long been women aviators and aircrew in the conventional @entity0 , just not on the special operations teams			2
by january 2016 , the military must open all combat jobs to women or explain why any must remain closed			1
the @entity17 lifted its ban on women in combat jobs in 2012 , but gave the military services time to gradually and systematically integrate women into the male - only front - line positions			1
special operations jobs are some of the last to be addressed , as commanders review the qualifications needed and assess the impact of bringing women in			0
military leaders have made it clear that they will not reduce standards for any jobs in order to let women in			2
one just for men : a @entity3 instructor explains to company of @entity153 the technical instructions of repelling from the 50 ft rock to his left in @entity157 , @entity45			2

the @entity0 will allow as many as 60 women to participate in the next @entity3 course , allowing women for the first time to compete in combat school
women and men preparing for the @entity3 course will be able to participate in a 16 - day training to teach infantry and combat skills
