it ’s quite understandable that the @entity1 and other parties with a vested interest should promote @entity4 versus @entity5 for the @entity7 captaincy as some kind of heavyweight clash of equals			1
but there ’s no reason the rest of us need fall for it			0
quite frankly , when the newly - formed five - man committee meet on wednesday to decide this important matter , they either give the nod to @entity4 or they make themselves look ridiculous			1
@entity4 and @entity5 are battling it out to be @entity23 captain yes , the @entity24 is a wonderful character and it is amazing he ’s still competitive on tour at 51			1
but the idea he could leapfrog @entity4 for a post considered the pinnacle of a player ’s career should offend anyone who has followed closely the fortunes of the @entity23 game these past 20 years			1
have n’t we had too many captains born in the @entity38 and is n’t this a chance to recognise the enormous contribution made by mainland @entity23 ? well , it ’s an argument			1
but forgive me if i stick to the idea that the best candidate should get the nod , regardless of where they were born , and @entity4 is plainly the best			1
the most important consideration has to be the views of the players who are likely to make up the next team			0
by my calculations , eight who were at @entity54 last time have said it should go to @entity4 , with four undeclared			1
are the committee really going to go against the wishes of such men as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 ? public relations has become a massive part of the job and it is hard to see how @entity5 would cope , on several levels			1
it would be wrong if his fractured @entity72 precluded him , but a long - held disinclination to do interviews that do n’t suit him ought to be taken into account			2
@entity4 is no angel in this regard , either			1
he ’s had his mad moments ; indeed there have been plenty of things he ’d probably do differently if he had the chance			0
@entity62 wants fellow @entity84 to be @entity23 captain for 2016 @entity7 defence but he ’s bursting with pride merely at the thought of getting this job , and would cope far better with all the unspoken demands			1
in terms of playing records , there is no comparison			0
@entity4 has won an @entity94 and two @entity96 events , achievements that @entity5 can not get near			1
that might not matter anymore , given @entity100 ’s stellar captaincy last time			0
like @entity5 , he had not won a major or any of the @entity101			2
@entity100 pushed all the right buttons as @entity23 sailed to victory over the @entity104 in 2014 but @entity7 records have to be part of the equation — and here there is no comparison , either			1
@entity5 ’s record is poor , with 5.5 points gained from 15 matches for a win percentage of just 37 per cent			2
@entity4 ’s win percentage is 58 per cent from 20 matches played			2
there are few men who can better that percentage in the long history of the contest but two of them will decide his fate tomorrow morning — @entity123 , captain in 2010 , and @entity125 , who was skipper in 2012			0
alongside @entity100 , @entity127 ( representing the tournament players ’ committee ) and outgoing chief executive @entity130 , they will surely pick the man whose outstanding contribution to @entity23 golf deserves the ultimate accolade			1
it has to be @entity4			2
@entity136 to give @entity62 a run for his money at the masters we ’ve reached that period in the season when all eyes turn to @entity104 and we ’re looking for runners and riders who might upset the favourite @entity62 when the @entity139 comes around in april			0
we ’ve seen @entity147 fall at the first fence			0
we ’ve seen @entity149 pull up lame			0
and , on the unrivalled @entity151 in @entity152 last week , we saw three gifted performers lengthen their stride to illustrate their legitimate claims			0
@entity104 @entity136 impressed on his return from six - month leave of absence there was @entity161 @entity160 , now blessedly injury - free and following up his win the previous week with a top - seven finish ; @entity104 ’s best young golfer @entity163 , who went so close on his @entity139 debut last time , putting together four rounds in the sixties to demonstrate fame and fortune will not distract him			0
and finally there was @entity136 , back from his six - month leave of absence with rounds of 69 , 67 , 68 , 66 and vowing to put his party lifestyle behind him			0
@entity62 aims to build on his two major wins in 2014 and complete a career grand slam at april 's masters like @entity62 and @entity179 , the huge - hitting @entity136 should look upon @entity180 as a venue where he has been bequeathed an enormous advantage			0
you might want to get a cheeky pound or two on him now , because my guess is his price will fall dramatically over the next seven weeks			0
he looks a man hell - bent on redemption .			2
