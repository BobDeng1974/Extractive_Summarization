anything you can do mr @entity1 ... @entity12 braved muddy conditions and cold water in the @entity30 feat : @entity12 took part in the @entity33 on thursday afternoon tough : the prime minister was forced to climb through a low tunnel as part of the annual race success : mr @entity12 posed with his wife @entity39 after receiving a medal for completing the race the @entity33 requires competitors to cover a course just over a mile long , and this year involved considerably more water than usual thanks to recent heavy rain			1
the stream close to the village of @entity49 , known as the @entity33 , was raging so much this year that children normally allowed to compete were barred from wading through some sections			2
cut : the prime minister 's knee support did not stop him sustaining a nasty - looking graze on his shin ready to go : mr @entity12 rubbed his hands in anticipation at the start line of the race victory ! the exhausted politician was still happy to pose for photographs at the end of the race support : well - wishers cheered on the prime minister as they took pictures of his exploits hilarity : the fun race is intended as a charity fund - raiser and ends at a local pub mr @entity12 , however , was able to secure plenty of photographs of himself taming the torrent			1

mr @entity12 may have been the most famous competitor in this year 's race , but he was not the only well - known runner - olympic medallist hockey player @entity98 was also invited to run in the race			0
joining in : this is the third time mr @entity12 has taken part in the @entity33 evasive action : the race may not be very long , but runners must brave a cold and muddy stream laid - back : he may be the most powerful man in the country , but mr @entity12 sported casual lycra and a pair of shorts nonetheless tired out : the prime minister relaxed with a fellow competitor after reaching the finishing line ice cold : @entity8 's prime minister @entity1 swims in a cold lake during a vacation in southern @entity117			1
