they say a mother will do anything for her child even if it means putting herself in harm 's way			1
in this case , a fully - grown hippopotamus was flipped several feet into the air as she stood her ground against an aggressive elephant bull , giving her calf time to run to safety			2
amazingly , she emerged relatively unscathed from the attack suffering nothing more than a little cut on the side of her body and a rather bruised ego			1
a mother hippo was flipped several feet into the air as she stood her ground against an aggressive elephant bull , giving her calf time to run to safety the scene was captured by wildlife photographer @entity25 , 40 , at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			1
' i felt incredible privileged to see this			2
i 've been in the bush a long time , but this was the most spectacular scene i 've ever witnessed , i could n't believe it , ' the @entity31 said			1
@entity25 , who works as a @entity35 in @entity36 , a small town in the north east of @entity28 , on the @entity40 border , was spending a long weekend at the reserve with wife @entity42 and a host of other family members			1
the spectacular scene unfolded on sunday after lunch when all of the other guests had gone back to their rooms to sleep			1
ouch : despite the force of the attack the mother hippo emerged relatively unscathed suffering just a cut on the side of her body take that : an elephant bull charges a female hippopotamus as her calf scampers to safety , in @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 do n't cross him : the hippo rolls after she is flipped into the air by the angry elephant from the vantage point of a restaurant viewing deck overlooking a water hole , the photographer and his loved ones got a private view of this incredible animal interaction			1
' i was taking photographs of the hippos in the water but because of the ongoing drought the staff came and put some grass out for hippos , because they have nothing else to eat , ' @entity25 said			2
' immediately about twenty hippos came out of the water and started grazing			2
' the next moment a large elephant bull came charging out of the bush in a rush , it was going for the grass as well			2
' the elephant was initially happily grazing alongside the hippos but became agitated and flapped its ears frantically when they began to venture closer			2
charge : the hippos got to close for comfort for the elephant who was grazing alongside them happily at first the baby hippos run for safety as the mother takes the full brunt of the force by the elephant the scene was captured by wildlife photographer @entity106 , 40 , at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 when the hippo mother in the pictures strayed just that little bit too close the elephant decided to take drastic action			1
although adult female hippos can weigh upwards of 1.5 tonnes the cow was dwarfed by the male elephant - which was able to flip her with his trunk with ease			1
' she landed on her back and rolled 360 degrees down the embankment towards the water , ' @entity25 said			0
' afterwards , the elephant just stood there and shook his head			0
the hippo retreated into the water			1
' the calf ran away towards the other hippos and the mother stayed in the water for about five minutes before eventually coming out			0
it happened so quickly , elephants are incredibly fast over short distances			0
' i felt very sorry for the mother trying to protect her young			0
it was quite emotional to see her go to those lengths , to stand her ground against a much bigger animal			0
' you could see in her whole demeanor that she was quite taken aback , even the elephant seemed like he was thinking about what he did			0
' the mother and the calf were quickly reunited but far from being lavished with sympathy , the herd acted aggressively towards her and she was forced to retreat with her calf and stand apart from the group			0
the elephant 's mood did not improve much , as he carried out a handful of mock charges on other hippos before venturing into the waterhole to chase away a few sunbathing crocodiles			0
the grumpy giant then treated himself to a dust bath before departing , leaving the hippos to finish grazing in peace			0
' for me , it was the experience of a lifetime , ' @entity25 said			0
' i felt privileged to see animal behaviour like that , but i also felt for the mother			0
all of us just stood there for a while afterwards not talking , just taking in the scene			1
