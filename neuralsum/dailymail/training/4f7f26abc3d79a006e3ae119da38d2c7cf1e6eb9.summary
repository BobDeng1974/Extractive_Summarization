@entity1 captain @entity0 says a strong emphasis has been put on collective self - analysis by his players ahead of sunday 's @entity6 appointment with @entity7 at @entity8			1
it is eight years since @entity1 were last toppled by the @entity10 , but they will head to @entity11 following a confidence - shaking @entity13 loss against @entity14 six days ago			1
@entity1 failed to score a point in the second half as @entity14 impressively wiped out a 16 - 8 interval deficit , leaving @entity0 and company facing an uphill task during this season 's @entity6 tournament			1
@entity0 ( 2nd right ) leads the @entity1 players out for training ahead of the match against @entity7 the @entity1 captain faced the media on wednesday ahead of their second @entity6 clash two years ago , @entity1 were beaten by @entity28 in their opening game , but they recovered superbly to reel off four successive wins , culminating with a record 30 - 3 demolition of @entity14			1
and @entity0 's men face doing it the hard way again , with three of their next four games - @entity7 , @entity36 and @entity37 - being away from home			1
' we need to try and play a bit more rugby , ' @entity0 said			2
' that is what we are about , and when we play well we get our key players in the game and get some go - forward			2
' teams are starting to play a little bit less rugby against us and it 's how we can adapt to that			0
wales take on @entity7 at @entity8 on saturday , and have n't lost to the @entity10 for eight year @entity0 is looking for his side to respond following the disappointing defeat by @entity14 in opener ' we have spoken about it as players , and if it happened again i think we would respond a lot better than we did last friday			1
' everybody has had a really good look at their own game and how they can improve , whether it 's contact area or a front - row forward at the scrum			2
' i would never question the effort of anyone , but sometimes you have to think on the move and it 's not down to the coaches			0
they are not on the field with us and we have to figure it out ourselves			0
players will take responsibility for that			0
' we went in at half - time after @entity81 's drop - goal and felt in control			2
' things were going to plan but in the second half @entity14 slowed up a lot of our ball , were effective at the tackle area , drove a lot of their lineouts and did n't give us too much possession			2
they got their tactics right and we did n't react to that			0
' @entity0 's @entity1 were well beaten by @entity96 's side at the @entity13 last friday @entity14 centre @entity97 scored the decisive try of the game as they got the better of @entity1 on friday @entity1 head coach @entity101 has made just one change for the @entity11 trip , with @entity104 replacing rested wing @entity105			1
and for the @entity1 forwards especially it represents a chance to redeem themselves , given how much domination @entity14 enjoyed up - front			1
@entity0 added : ' we had a forwards meeting this week that was scheduled to be five to 10 minutes , but it went on quite a bit longer than that			2
' it was good talking through our decision - making at certain lineouts , what our thought process was and what we could do to change things			0
' a lot of players spoke up about their own roles and it 's better than sitting down and having the coaches telling us @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and what we should , or should n't , have done			0
the atmosphere at the @entity13 was electrifying both before and during the contest @entity14 head coach @entity96 has hailed his side 's 21 - 16 win against @entity1 in the @entity6 ' they let the players figure it out for ourselves because that is what we will have to do in a game			1
' there was a lot said and it was a productive morning			0
we did n't do a lot of training but the amount of talking that we did will help us moving forward			0
' it 's always an arm - wrestle for quite a long time against @entity7 and , looking at them now , their line speed is excellent in defence and it will be another big challenge for us			1
' we need to get back to winning ways and it is must - win because if we want to win the championship we are going to have to win all four of our remaining games			0
' one step at a time , but we have to win on sunday			0
