hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in @entity3 due to concerns over starvation the @entity3 government euthanised 686 koalas at @entity9 , about 230km southwest of @entity10 during three separate operations , veterinarians captured and sedated koalas to assess their health			1
koalas suffering starvation were euthanised , while healthy koalas were released back into the wild and healthy females were treated with control hormone implants			2
the cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals			2
@entity45 chief @entity44 said she had heard rumours that koalas were being killed but had never had proof until now			2
' i want somebody charged , ' ms @entity49 said			0
' the @entity53 government over my whole career has said there will never be a cull in @entity57 ever			2
' it 's cruel and mean to koalas and pays no respect for the role they play in tourism - how dare they treat this animal with that sort of level of disrespect			2
@entity45 chief @entity44 questioned why the program was conducted in secret ' and if they are so proud of what they were doing why was it done in secret ? ' koala expert dr @entity76 , who advised the government on the euthanasia program , said that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size			1
ms @entity49 said more should have been done in previous years to stop the problem from escalating ' watching an animal starve to death is a horrible thing , ' dr @entity76 , from @entity85 , told @entity89			0
' for every one koala that was euthanised there were probably two or three that starved without intervention			0
' it at least was a good thing to put them out of their misery			0
' dr @entity76 said moving the population to other areas or conducting fertility control programs were expensive options			0
' a lot of people ask why we ca n't just move the koalas somewhere else , but i think it 's important to recognise the translocation koalas often has a negative impact , ' she said			0
' a large number would die , and they do n't want to move from manna gum			1
' it 's sort of a lose - lose situation all round			0
' dr @entity76 said the problem in the manna gum woodland at @entity9 was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from @entity120			1
' manna gum is a very good food source for koalas , it 's low in toxins and high in nutrients so koalas love it , ' she said			1
' to the point where they do n't move for the food supply			0
' @entity133 can move one or two kilometres in a night but in this population , they stay in these manna gum areas and numbers build up			1
' ms @entity49 said more should have been done in previous years to prevent the problem from escalating			0
the problem in the manna gum woodland at @entity9 was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from @entity120 the koalas , many of which were starving , were killed via lethal injection after being captured in tree ' instead of doing this why did n't they plant trees all those years ago ? ' she said ' they could have taken young ones out and relocated them			1
' they 've done nothing – they 've watched until the problem becomes immense and then gone " oh we better do something let 's kill them			0
" ' it 's easy to say we had to put them out of their misery – they should n't have got to that misery in first place			0
' at @entity9 there are up to 11 koalas per hectare , but the sustainable density is less than one koala per hectare			1
the cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals koala expert dr @entity76 , who advised the government on the euthanasia program , stressed that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size @entity3 environment minister @entity182 said she was putting in place a koala management program to deal with the ' a very challenging and complex issue '			1
' it is clear it 's an overpopulation issue and it is clear that we have had koalas suffer in that @entity9 area because of ill health and starvation , ' ms @entity182 told @entity195			1
' that 's just not good enough and that 's a terrible way to treat koalas			0
' i 'm wanting to make sure that we 're taking the best action we can in this terrible situation of overpopulation			0
' i do n't want to see koalas suffer			0
' the koala is listed as ' vulnerable ' in @entity206 , @entity207 and the @entity208 and as ' rare ' in @entity57 but it has no official listing in @entity3 .			2
