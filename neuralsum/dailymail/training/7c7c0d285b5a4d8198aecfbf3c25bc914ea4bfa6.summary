find all the statistics , heat maps and goals with @entity5 's @entity4 service ! @entity6 capitalised on two @entity8 howlers to earn @entity9 a second away win of the season and move them to the edge of the top four — but improvement will be required to secure a @entity18 berth			1
the first goal came courtesy of @entity21 , who effectively passed the ball into @entity6 ’s path with only keeper @entity24 between the @entity26 forward and goal — and @entity6 duly snaffled the chance			1
the second goal , scored in the final moments to flatter the scoreline , was laid on a plate by former @entity33			2
the @entity34 was faffing around with the ball at his feet when he could have simply hoofed it clear and @entity6 simply nipped in , took the ball and scored			1
@entity9 's @entity6 shoots to score past @entity8 goalkeeper @entity24 during their @entity41 match on saturday @entity6 lifted the ball over goalkeeper @entity24 to make it 1 - 0 as @entity9 saw out the game with the first - half goal on saturday @entity6 runs away in celebration on saturday at the @entity47 after giving @entity9 a lead they would never lose @entity6 during his celebration at the @entity47 as @entity9 won 2 - 0 on saturday against @entity8 @entity8 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity24 5 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6 , @entity21 4 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 5 , 74 ) , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 5 , 74 ) , @entity60 5 ( @entity61 6 , 51 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 goals : none bookings : @entity54 , @entity53 , @entity61 @entity9 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity70 6 , @entity71 7 , mertesacker 6 , @entity72 6 , @entity73 6 ( @entity74 6 , 74 ) , @entity75 6 ( @entity76 , 88 ) , @entity77 6 , @entity78 7 ( @entity79 , 90 ) , @entity80 7 , @entity6 8 , @entity81 7 subs ( not used ) : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 goals : @entity6 ( 30 , 90 ) bookings : @entity73 , @entity81 , @entity75 referee : @entity90 ( @entity91 ) attendance : 44,449 man of the match : @entity6 the match as a whole was mediocre , @entity9 operating at training pace for long stretches and @entity8 desperate to make sure they did not succumb to a second successive monstering after being embarrassed 8 - 0 at @entity101 last week			1
but @entity9 manager @entity102 naturally took the positives at the end of a week in which he celebrated his 65th birthday with a late comeback victory at @entity107 in the @entity18			1
‘ of course i am happy because we had a difficult game on wednesday night , ’ he said			2
‘ i believe we were in control			2
before scoring a second goal , of course you can concede a goal and drop points			2
we did n’t do it today , we were focused			2
‘ we won at @entity107 and we won here , two and a half days later			0
’ @entity102 praised @entity6 for the ability and talent that allowed him to make the most of the hosts ’ errors			1
‘ he took advantage of the mistakes they made , ’ @entity102 said			1
‘ he has a super quality , he is quick on his feet			0
that ’s why he wins many balls that normal players do n’t win			0
‘ his transition from offence to defence is very quick and he wins the ball back very quickly and he can take advantage of that			0
’ this latest reverse for @entity8 leaves them with just a single win to go with five draws and three defeats			1
manager @entity140 insisted he was heartened by the response to last week ’s drubbing but was disappointed that individual errors had again been so costly			1
‘ it ’s difficult to analyse the game because the commitment , reaction , desire and organisation compared to last week was there , ’ he said			0
‘ but we forgot to leave the mistakes in the dressing room			0
’ @entity140 also said his team were angry			1
‘ they fought hard for the result and two actions cost us			0
’ but he believes @entity8 ’s problem is psychological rather than any technical or tactical issue			1
‘ we ’re getting paid to win games and we ’ve won one and need to change that , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s about character now , being brave enough to go on the pitch and believe we can win			0
’ @entity140 made two changes to his starting line - up , bring in @entity55 and @entity58 as @entity56 and @entity61 dropped to the bench			2
@entity81 has a shot during @entity9 's 2 - 0 win over @entity8 at the @entity47 on saturday afternoon @entity140 looks frustrated during @entity8 's 2 - 0 loss against @entity9 on saturday afternoon at the @entity47 @entity140 's @entity8 side sit around the relegation zone after losing 2 - 0 against @entity9 at the @entity47 @entity174 miles @entity8 112.3 69.8 @entity57 90 12.1 7.5 @entity54 90 12.0 7.4 @entity50 90 11.1 6.9 @entity9 111.6 69.3 @entity77 90 12.5 7.8 @entity80 90 11.0 6.9 @entity6 90 11.0 6.8 @entity8 pushed forward at the start and had the first sight of goal in the second minute , @entity55 heading wide from @entity179 ’s cross			1
if that looked promising it was a false dawn because their only other efforts that carried threat in the first half were headers from @entity52 and @entity55 , and both of those were blocked			0
@entity9 ’s first chance was in the seventh minute from a corner taken by @entity80			1
it was headed clear only as far as @entity73 , but he lashed wide from the edge of the area			0
@entity80 fed @entity6 a minute later and he also shot and missed			1
at the other end , @entity21 nodded on to @entity52 , whose header was blocked			0
then came the clearest chance up to that point of the match when @entity81 , who received the ball on the left corner of the area , switched it on to his right foot and smacked the ball just over			0
@entity73 was booked for taking out @entity58 , the first of a spate of yellows cards either side of the break , with @entity81 and @entity75 among others to go into @entity90 ’s book			0
@entity81 was booked for an alleged dive in the second half but it looked a harsh decision because his movement was impeded by @entity52			0
@entity75 ’s booking five minutes after that was arguably lenient , for a high kick on @entity55 that might well have given him a facial injury			0
@entity9 went ahead in the 30th minute thanks to @entity21 ’s error in the centre circle			1
first , he failed to control a simple pass from a team - mate and then he made a hash of an attempted back pass , twisting his kicking leg and making minimal contact with the ball			0
in doing so , he gave possession to @entity6 with nobody between the @entity231 forward and the @entity8 goal			1
@entity6 dashed forward and chipped over @entity24			2
@entity80 had a chance to extend the lead three minutes later but his left - footed shot flew wide right			2
on the hour , @entity6 ’s effort from outside the box forced a save from @entity24 and then another former @entity9 man , @entity54 , elicited a save from @entity70 at the other end			1
@entity59 , on as a substitute for @entity55 , headed on target and @entity70 saved again			0
@entity6 rubbed @entity8 ’s noses in it with his late second goal when @entity24 was clearly at fault			1
‘ @entity24 has been educated at @entity9 so of course i have some sympathy , ’ @entity102 said			1
‘ he is like anyone else [ at @entity8 ] , his confidence has dropped a little bit because of the defeat last week			2
but he has shown his qualities since he arrived here and will show that again			0
’ @entity9 must demonstrate their own , more clearly and more often			2
@entity6 makes it 2 - 0 by going around @entity24 and securing @entity9 's 2 - 0 win against @entity8 on saturday afternoon @entity6 takes advantage and makes it 2 - 0 on saturday against @entity8 , who were left teetering about the relegation zone @entity6 runs away in celebration after securing three points for @entity102 's team on saturday afternoon @entity24 looks frustrated after @entity8 lose 2 - 0 at the @entity47 to leave them near the @entity41 relegation zone @entity6 was kept busy for @entity9 as they won 2 - 0 against @entity8			1
