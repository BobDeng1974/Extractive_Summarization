it has clocked up an astonishing 11billion miles in its 35 - year journey			0
and now , to celebrate the cosmic anniversary , @entity2 has re-released two historic images taken from the spacecraft @entity6 during its explorations of our solar system			1
the @entity6 is about to bid farewell to the solar system , becoming the first man - made object to escape the heliosheath bubble that surrounds our solar system , and venture out into interstellar space			1
this tiny dot , amid a band of coloured rays , is our planet , as seen from staggering distance of 11,100,000,000 miles away , and pictured in 1990			0
this latest image taken by @entity6 and released by @entity2 shows the @entity24 as a dot in the solar system as the twin spacecraft explore the edge of our solar system poised to cross into interstellar space : this image , taken by the @entity6 spacecraft , shows a volcanic plume on the @entity32 the twin spacecraft of @entity6 and @entity34 - one of @entity36 's earliest rockets - were launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets including @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity6 has reached the our solar system 's final frontier and is poised to cross into interstellar space			1
the probe has also beamed back incredible images of the @entity32 , showing a volcanic plume			2
last month , @entity6 signalled it had passed two of the ' key changes ' expected when it passes out of the furthest fringes of our solar system			1
the @entity6 probe has been travelling towards the outer reaches of the solar system since 1977 - it has enough batteries to last until 2020 , scientists estimate this is the furthest distance any man - made object has ever travelled - and on july 28th , it 's long and arduous journey was broken by cosmic changes			1
the data received from the @entity6 , which travels at ten miles a second , on july 28 showed a five per cent spike in the level of high - energy cosmic rays			0
this implies the @entity6 is moving out of the heliosheath - the ' protective bubble ' around the solar system created from charged particles from the sun. on the same day , the level of lower - energy particles coming from within the solar system dropped by half			1
however , over the next three days , these levels returned to their previous amounts , giving @entity2 scientists a small mystery to study while they await for more information			0
for the past year , @entity6 used its instruments to explore the new region			0
it appeared to be the cosmic doldrums where solar winds streaming out from the sun at 1 million mph have dramatically eased @entity6 is now detecting the first traces of ' interstellar winds ' - the signs it is finally reaching the edges of solar system the third indicator that the @entity6 is leaving the solar system is the direction of the magnetic field , and this is now being studied by @entity2			2
once all signals have been passed , @entity2 can confirm the @entity6 is on to the final frontier , and they expect to provide a preliminary report on the magnetic fields this month			0
voyager project scientist @entity111 said : ' these are thrilling times for the @entity113 as we try to understand the quickening pace of changes as @entity6 approaches the edge of interstellar space			0
' we are certainly in a new region at the edge of the solar system where things are changing rapidly			2
but we are not yet able to say that @entity6 has entered interstellar space			0
' voyager 1 and its twin , @entity34 , were launched in 1977 to tour the outer planets including @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 video : at the edge of the solar system , @entity6 reports a sharp increase in cosmic rays ...			2
