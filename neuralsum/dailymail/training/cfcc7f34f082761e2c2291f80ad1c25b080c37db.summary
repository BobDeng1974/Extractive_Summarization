by @entity0 turning the semi-derelict medieval farm into a charming rural home has gobbled up her £ 600,000 life savings and a decade of her time			2
but widow @entity6 has now been told she will have to tear it down ... because she should be sharing it with turkeys			1
the 500 - year - old building in a remote hamlet on north @entity12 is a very rare example of a @entity15 longhouse with a partially uncovered ‘ shippon ’ - an indoor area for livestock			1
defeat : @entity6 's renovations to her home in @entity15 could be gobbled up if she refuses to keep turkeys disputed area : mrs @entity6 in the farm 's medieval ' shippon ' , which always had an agricultural use the arrangement was common in the medieval period , when humans and animals lived together under the same roof			1
@entity31 insists that half the shippon should have been kept for ‘ agricultural use ’ to preserve @entity35 ’s ‘ cultural significance ’			1
dispute : mrs @entity6 is up against national park laws mrs @entity6 , 77 , told the @entity38 : ‘ i asked what i could do with the shippon if it was agricultural			1
i was told i could keep a cart - horse or turkeys – but they would be 6ft from my dining table			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous , they want me to create a museum that no one will ever visit			2
my house is not open to the public , and i do n’t want to start turkey farming at my age			1
’ yesterday the authority refused her application for retrospective planning permission for the restorations			0
having spent £ 100,000 on the shippon alone , she now faces having to spend even more undoing her hard work			0
if the authority has its way , half the dining area could be carpeted , but the rest of the room would have an earth floor and an unglazed window			2
planning officers said the survival of half the shippon before the work was a ‘ crucial feature ’ when it was awarded a grade ii * - listing in 1988 – meaning it is a ‘ particularly important building of more than special interest ’ , the next category down from a grade i - listing			2
mrs @entity6 bought the cottage in @entity77 , near @entity78 , in 2003 for £ 400,000 with her husband @entity79 , a retired @entity80 air commodore and an ace fighter pilot in the @entity82			1
they were granted planning permission in 2009 after submitting an application which retained the agricultural character of the shippon			0
before he died aged 90 in 2010 , mr @entity88 asked her to finish the restoration as his last wish			0
preservation : mrs @entity6 's home in the @entity12 pictured the way it used to look ... ... and how it looks now after she spent £ 600,000 converting it			1
her retrospective planning application failed when the couple bought the house , part of the shippon had rush matting over an earth floor			0
mrs @entity6 then laid concrete over the 15ft by 18ft area , which she uses as a storage space			1
but the authority says this amounts to it being used for domestic purposes and diminishes its ‘ historic interest ’			0
last night a spokesman said unauthorised works without the prior grant of @entity115 is a criminal offence under the @entity117			0
a future meeting will consider whether remedial action must take place and if so , what specific works and over what time scale			0
planning consultant @entity124 said : ‘ i ’ve never seen such a bizarre situation			0
to try to turn the clock back like this makes no sense whatsoever			0
’ orders : planning authorities say parts of the home including this one should be dug up again and changed rare : there are five or six unconverted shippons on @entity12 and fewer than 20 converted ones			2

@entity6 , 77 , turned rare 500 - year - old @entity15 longhouse into a home
but @entity31 insisted it keep an agricultural use
they said she could keep a cart horse or turkeys 6ft from her dining table
she said : ' it 's ridiculous ... i do *n't* want to start turkey farming at my age '
