families may have to separate their rubbish into six bins from next year , @entity1 ’s biggest waste firm warned yesterday			1
@entity6 rules coming into force this january dictate that councils should collect glass , paper , tin cans and plastic separately , to avoid contamination and ensure they can be properly recycled			1
@entity14 , which collects or sorts rubbish for a third of the population , said the regulations are likely to force councils to place more bins outside every home			1
they warned : ‘ from january 2015 , @entity6 rules mean households and businesses may need to separate their waste into six separate bins			1
@entity14 thinks most of the sorting can be done post-collection and that four bins are more than enough			1
’ government officials insist councils should be left to decide how to collect rubbish			2
they are looking closely at the wording of the revised @entity47 , which remains shrouded in confusion			0
they claim the rules may not lead to more bins – as local authorities could be exempted if they demonstrate that adding bins is not feasible			1
officials also say waste could be collected in fewer bins and then separated by binmen on the pavement – but @entity14 has dismissed this proposal as dangerous			1
the company has attacked the latest rules as ‘ unnecessary ’ and ‘ completely impractical ’ , adding that modern technology means most rubbish can be separated after it has been collected			1
the firm said those calling for more separate collections are ‘ trying to push an environmental agenda that they do n’t understand ’			2
a @entity69 poll commissioned by @entity14 suggested 69 per cent of people are not prepared to separate their rubbish into more than four bins			1
the poll found that 94 per cent of the 2,500 respondents said recycling was important – but only 12 per cent considered having six or more bins reasonable			0
@entity77 , @entity14 ’s technical director , said : ‘ the public are very supportive of recycling , but we must make it easy for them			2
’ firm says those asking for more collections are ' pushing an environmental agenda that they do n’t understand ’ ‘ some other groups and consultants are trying to push an environmental agenda that they do n’t understand			0
they are pushing for everything to be separate ... this will be completely impractical for people			2
we are just saying let ’s be sensible , it needs to be easier for people , not harder			0
’ the wording of the waste regulation , drawn up in 2010 , is so unclear that the @entity96 had to issue a separate document on how to follow the rules			1
this still failed to clarify matters , and there has been much debate over whether the rules compel councils to introduce extra bins , or if different items can be placed together in single ‘ co-mingled ’ containers			2
environment minister @entity108 has given guidance to councils , stating : ‘ separate collection does not of course mean that each household will need more bins			2
' for example , many areas have kerbside sort systems where materials are sorted before being loaded into the waste collection vehicle			0
’ however , mr @entity77 said kerbside separation ‘ is not feasible everywhere ’ , adding : ‘ it is not very safe			0
’ the @entity121 insisted councils should be left alone to decide how to deal with waste			0
a spokesman said : ‘ there is no one - size - fits - all solution ... the types of bin which would suit a large detached house in the country would be completely unsuitable for a high - rise block of flats in inner - city @entity133 , and vice versa			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity136 said : ‘ waste collections need to be easy to understand for residents			0
‘ local councils are best placed to decide how to organise collection schemes in their areas			0
this new regulation does not mean households require more bins			0

waste company @entity14 has launched campaign against ' unnecessary bins '
firm says @entity6 rules could mean people have to separate rubbish six times
however *legislation* is so badly worded that full impact remains unclear
