he says : ' i did n't enjoy it			0
i 'm a man and it 's just not easy doing something so feminine , but i coped and we were both so happy when @entity34 came along			2
' we always wanted @entity34 to have a sibling , and the second pregnancy was tough too			2
i had terrible morning sickness and i was really tired			0
' when i had @entity34 i 'd only recently transitioned , so i did n't look so manly and people just thought @entity10 and i were lesbians			1
' but , when i was a pregnant with @entity35 , people were really staring at me , which made me feel very self - conscious			1

i hated the way my body was changing			0
it did not match my inner feelings			0
' unable to bear the thought of natural birth , @entity11 opted for caesarean			1
' it cut out part of the very female process of giving birth			2
' but it 's all been worth it , regardless of how difficult it was			0
' @entity10 did not mind missing that part of being woman			1
she says : ' i was very happy not to carry the children			2
it was great to get out of it - the inconvenience , the physical changes , the pain of birth			2

' @entity11 says : ' @entity34 always calls @entity10 , @entity211 and me , @entity213			1
' and @entity10 is definitely the typically clucking and over protective mum - in that respect we certainly conform to the stereotypical parents			1
