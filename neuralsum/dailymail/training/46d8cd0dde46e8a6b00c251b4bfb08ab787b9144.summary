people with high iq scores are n't just more intelligent - they also process sensory information differently , according to new study			1
scientists discovered that the brains of people with high @entity7 are automatically more selective when it comes to perceiving moving objects , meaning that they are more likely to suppress larger and less relevant background motion			1
‘ it is not that people with high @entity7 are simply better at visual perception , ’ said @entity11 of the @entity12			1
‘ instead , their visual perception is more discriminating			0
' scientists discovered that the brains of people with high @entity7 are more selective when perceiving objects in motion , meaning that they are more likely to ignore larger and less relevant background motion ' they excel at seeing small , moving objects but struggle in perceiving large , background - like motions			1
’ the discovery was made by asking people to watch videos showing moving bars on a computer screen			1
their task was to state whether the bars were moving to the left or to the right			2
that ability to block out distraction helps to explain what makes some brains more efficient than others the researchers measured how long the video had to run before the individual could correctly perceive the motion			1
the results show that individuals with high iq can pick up on the movement of small objects faster than low - iq individuals can			1
' that was n't unexpected , @entity11 says			0
the surprise came when tests with larger objects showed just the opposite : individuals with high iq were slower to see what was right there in front of them			1
‘ there is something about the brains of high - iq individuals that prevents them from quickly seeing large , background - like motions , ’ @entity11 added			1
in other words , it is n't a conscious strategy but rather something automatic and fundamentally different about the way these people 's brains work			2
the ability to block out distraction is very useful in a world filled with more information than we can possibly take in			0
it helps to explain what makes some brains more efficient than others			2
an efficient brain ' has to be picky ' @entity11 said			2
the findings were reported in the @entity80 journal @entity81			0
an intelligence quotient or @entity7 is a score derived from a set of standardised tests developed to measure a person 's cognitive abilities or ‘ intelligence ’ in relation to their age group			2
iq tests do not measure intelligence the way a ruler measures height , but rather the way a race measures speed			0
modern iq tests produce scores for different areas - such as language fluency and three - dimensional thinking - with the overall score calculated from subtest scores			0
the average score , according to the bell curve , is 100			0
studies have linked iq scores to morbidity and mortality and even social status			0
the average iq scores for many populations have been rising at an average rate of three points per decade since the early 20th century , a phenomenon called the @entity118 effect			0
it is disputed whether these changes in scores reflect real changes in intellectual abilities .			0

experts found that a high @entity7 brain was better able to block out larger or more *irrelevant* images when *focussing* on a small moving object
but surprisingly , when tested with larger objects , people with a high iq were slower to see what was right in front of them
scientists say this explains why some brains are more efficient than others
