by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 05:16 est , 15 october 2013 online tv giant @entity1 is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies in a bid to launch a tv service			1
@entity6 , chief executive of @entity1 , has allegedly met with some of the biggest cable companies in recent weeks to discuss plans which could present a rival to @entity10			1
three people who claim to be close to the talks said the service would come through set - top boxes , with a fourth adding that it could be an extra option added to a viewer 's bill			2
leading online tv company @entity1 is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies about a deal which could see it become a paid on - demand service to rival @entity10 the move would represent a major about - face in relations between the company and tv providers , who initially saw the internet giant as a big threat to their $ 100billion - a - year ( £ 62.5bn ) industry			1
@entity6 has strongly hinted at investor conferences in recent weeks about the possibility of @entity1 one day being a cable channel rival to premium networks such as @entity36 's @entity10			1
he said : ' it 's not in the short term , but it 's in the natural direction for us in the long term			0
many ( cable service providers ) would like to have a competitor to @entity10 , and they would bid us off of @entity10			0
' while many played off the remarks as general speculation about the future , others have suggested that at least one cable provider could experiment with the service by the end of the year			2
talks are though to involve @entity53 and @entity54 , though @entity1 will not comment on the rumours			0
the move would give @entity1 more room to expand its subscriptions as internet capabilities stuggle to keep up with demand			0
the service already accounts for a third of all peak @entity64 internet traffic , using almost twice as much bandwidth as @entity66			0
the market potential is clear too , as in a recent survey by @entity69 per cent of those polled said they still subscribed to cable , while 41 per cent said they used @entity1			1
a @entity69 poll in june showed that , while 41 per cent of people use @entity1 , a whopping 70 per cent still subscribe to cable tv however , the world 's most popular streaming service still has some way to go in order to compete in the tv market			1
despite producing the award winning show @entity85 , its original content falls way behind the likes of @entity10 , who are behind dozens of hit series including @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			0
@entity36 chief executive @entity94 famously dismissed the idea that @entity1 was a serious threat by equating the service to the ' @entity98			1
' it must also face down stiff competition online from the likes of @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 who are thought to have major plans in the works			0
even if a deal is reached in the near - term , actually receiving @entity1 through a cable provider could still take months to launch			2
@entity6 would first need to rework his licensing deals with programmers since most existing contracts will not allow @entity1 to deliver their shows on a cable box , according to a senior programming executive			2
@entity1 is currently the world 's leading internet television network with more than 37 million members in 40 countries watching more than one billion hours of tv programmes and films every month			0
