by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 3 june 2013 @entity4 , pictured last week at his studio in @entity3 , wo n't design condoms designing for @entity6 might be his day job , but that does n't mean @entity4 wo n't throw his weight behind other brands			1
@entity11 , @entity13 clothing , @entity15 ice cream , @entity16 , @entity18 designer jelly shoes , a watch collection , a diet book and even a helicopter have all been given the @entity23 seal of approval			1
but it seems there are still some things he considers too outlandish - among them condoms , toilet paper and support stockings			1
the revelations came during an interview with @entity35 magazine madame @entity33 , which asked him whether there was anything he would n’t put his name to			1
in response , the designer said : ' toilet paper ? support stockings ? condoms ? ' but perhaps realising how many products bear his brand already , @entity4 began to backtrack , adding : ' but maybe … you know , i am mainstream			1
' he also told the magazine of the things that make him lose his cool , saying : ' things that are not happening as i wish [ make me angry ]			0
the things that take time			0
' and people who say they are bored , even though i do n't spend time with these kinds of people			2
' i think that it 's a crime to say you are bored when time is so precious and there are so many things to do in life : read , learn , watch			0
' boy band @entity64 made headlines in 2010 when they partnered up with @entity66 to release a line of branded condoms			2
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 posed for photographs as they released the range , called @entity76 , which they hoped would encourage people to have safe sex			0
the four different packs of extra safe condoms featured each band member 's favourite colour and were branded with the boys ' faces			0
@entity70 said of the range : ' we came up with the idea of @entity76 as we wanted to send a clear message out to fans that are over 16 and sexually active - and that is to always use a condom during sex ... it 's important to put your love in a glove			0
' though unfortunately the world will have to wait for @entity4 condoms for a little while longer yet			2
the @entity6 designer has put his name to a diet book and bottles of @entity11 unlike boy band @entity64 , @entity4 is n't keen on putting his name on condoms			1

@entity6 designer has endorsed @entity107 , a diet book , jelly shoes and helicopter
@entity4 was *speaking* in an interview with madame @entity33
said he would n't put his name to condoms , stockings or toilet paper
