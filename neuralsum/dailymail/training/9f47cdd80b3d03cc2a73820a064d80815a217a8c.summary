@entity0 is suspected of interfering with two @entity2 government satellites in one of its most advanced hacking operations to date			1
on four occasions between 2007 and 2008 @entity0 agents are said to have breached security on the environment - monitoring craft			1
the last hack was so effective that they could have completely taken control of the satellite , but did not do so			2
gaining control : a report to @entity16 reveals efforts to hack into two government satellites in 2007 and 2008 were traced to a station in @entity20 a @entity16 report said that , while it could not prove for sure @entity0 was behind the attacks , what happened was ‘ consistent ’ with known @entity0 cyber war techniques			1
should a war begin @entity0 might be able to take over satellites and either use them for their own ends or manoeuvre them to destroy craft belonging to its enemies			1
the real - life @entity35 - style attacks come amid rising tensions over @entity0 and calls by @entity2 president @entity39 that it should ‘ play by the rules ’			1
the @entity2 has just approved its biggest long - term expansion of military presence in the @entity44 since the end of the @entity46 in a bid to counterbalance @entity0 ’s influence			1
accusing report : the @entity2 - @entity51 report all - but blames @entity0 for the cyber attacks some 2,500 extra troops will now be stationed in @entity54 in a move which has infuriated @entity56			1
yesterday president @entity39 said the @entity58 - on was @entity2 ’s ‘ top priority ’ , and that they were ' here to stay '			1
the satellite attacks were outlined in a report by the @entity2 - @entity51			1
a @entity64 earth observation satellite system experienced 12 or more minutes of interference in october 2007 and july 2008			2
ahead of the @entity68 summit today , @entity0 premier @entity66 demanded that ' outside forces ' had no excuse to get involved in the complex maritime dispute in the @entity72			0
it was a veiled warning to the @entity2 and other countries to keep out of the sensitive issue			0
he said : ' it ought to be resolved through friendly consultations and discussions by countries directly involved			0
outside forces should not , under any pretext , get involved			0
' the remarks are the latest barbs between the two countries in recent weeks , at a time when president @entity39 has sought to reassert @entity2 presence in the @entity89 to counter the growing influence of @entity0 , its biggest economic rival			0
the @entity2 wants the @entity72 dispute discussed at the @entity68 summit , but will clearly face strong opposition from @entity0			0
the @entity72 is a major route for some $ 5 trillion in trade each year , as well as being potentially rich in natural resources			0
hackers also interfered with a @entity100 am - 1 earth observation satellite twice , for two minutes in june 2008 and nine minutes in october that year			1
during the final hack ‘ the responsible party achieved all steps required to command the satellite ’ , but did not do so			0
both craft use the commercially operated @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity20 , that ‘ routinely relies on the internet for data access and file transfers , ’ the commission said , indicating this might have been how they were attacked			1
the satellites affected were run by @entity114 or the @entity115 and were mostly used for climate observation			2
but the @entity2 military and intelligence agencies also use them to communicate , collect intelligence and conduct reconnaissance			0
the report said @entity0 was the most likely culprit , and that the techniques ‘ appear consistent with authoritative @entity0 military writings ’ that have advocated disabling a foe ’s satellite control facilities on the ground in a conflict			1
general @entity130 , commander of the @entity131 , stressed that the information available was ‘ inconclusive ’ he said : ‘ first of all , i am familiar with the two incidents			1
the best information that i have is that we can not attribute those two occurrences			0
i guess i would agree that we do n’t have sufficient detail			0
' @entity0 has achieved several military firsts in the past year , including testing a stealth bomber and aircraft carrier and progress toward the first anti-ship ballistic missile			0
it has long been suspected of running a sophisticated hacking operation , and was blamed for the world ’s largest such attack , dubbed ‘ @entity147 ’ - which included a @entity149 defence contractor among its victims			2
yesterday , in another show of force , @entity0 ’s unmanned spacecraft returned to @entity154 successfully after more than two weeks in orbit , a pivotal point in its long - term space plans			2
mr @entity39 is currently in @entity158 , @entity159 , where he is the first @entity2 president to take part in the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) summit			0
he is expecting a showdown with @entity0 premier @entity66 over tensions in the @entity72 , a key shipping channel of which @entity0 has claimed a huge stake			0
@entity0 ’s embassy in @entity167 dismissed the satellite report , and said the commission was ‘ vilifying @entity0 ’s image ’ .			2
