sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others , a recent study claimed the implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding , it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders			1
this is because the genes that make up the people who we are , and the environments in which we are raised can not be considered independently of each other			2
the brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes , a study found			1
@entity27 ( left ) is accused of abusing seven women , while @entity29 ( right ) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse the research analysed dna from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in @entity38 between 1973 and 2009			1
it found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population			1
in seeking to explain this connection , the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors			2
this can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together			0
on the other hand , their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases , with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members			0
genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation ( 46 per cent ) than for adult rape ( 19 per cent )			1
while the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending , it can not of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved			1
dr @entity71 says that genetic material from both parents is passed on , but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents			1
of course genetic material from both parents is passed on , but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment			2
as can be seen from the percentages above , the largest proportion of cases involved a large , rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour			0
you may not have been born a criminal , but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour			0
this is according to a recent study which found that experiences , such as divorce and sexual abuse , could affect gene expressions that control a person 's predisposition to delinquency			1
the study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in @entity113 , @entity38 , who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour			2
as well as their behaviour , they spoke about past family conflict , experiences of sexual abuse , and the quality of their relationship with their parents			0
they also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted dna			0
one of the genes examined was @entity130 ( @entity130 )			0
this gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters , such as serotonin			0
the transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well - being and happiness ' about 25 per cent of @entity141 men carry the less active variant of @entity130 , ' explained professor @entity143 , a researcher at the @entity144			0
' among them , those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood			0
' separating nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment			1
any report of genes influencing behaviour tends to polarise opinion			0
some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending			1
others will be concerned about the stigmatisation of family members defined as ' at risk ' , but still unlikely to offend themselves			0
only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at - risk families would mainly target the innocent			1
so what then might this mean in practical terms ? the discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders ? a genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments			1
dubbed the ' criminal ' or ' warrior ' gene , it has in some cases even been used successfully by defence teams in mitigation pleas to avoid the death penalty in the @entity198 , or reduce the length of sentences in the @entity198 and @entity201			0
it might be thought odd that a convicted murderer , who is at increased risk of offending and therefore presumably more dangerous to the public in the future , would be treated more leniently			2
sex offenders , particularly where children are involved , are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour			1
what is clear is that finding genetic influences on behaviour does not affect legal responsibility			2
it is recognised that there are many genetic , biological and environmental factors that influence behaviour , and it may be harder for all sorts of reasons for some people to refrain from criminal acts than others			2
any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed , but the headline figure – a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases – does not tell us that sex offenders ' ca n't help it ' or are different from ' normal ' people			1

recent study found sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes
some argue this *knowledge* could help prevent people from offending
dr @entity71 says the genetic study ca n't separate nature from nurture
