hard - up : @entity2 families with a stay - at - home mum are worse off than in most of the developed world because of tough tax rules , researchers say families with stay - at - home mothers are worse off in the @entity2 than in most countries across the developed world , new research has revealed			1
the tax burden on couples with two children but only one breadwinner is much higher because the @entity2 fails to take family responsibilities as seriously as other rich nations , critics said today			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) has looked at 33 of the world 's most developed countries and found that the @entity2 's tax system hinders families with one working parent , the majority of which are married couples			1
across @entity19 countries the average tax rate for a typical family with one stay - at - home parent and one working person is around six per cent , but is nearly ten per cent in the @entity2			1
this is because there are not the significant tax breaks for them that are found in most other nations and can cost @entity2 thousands more in tax every year			0
it is believed that chancellor @entity38 may consider a new tax allowance for married couples in his upcoming budget to try to rectify this inequality			0
the extra tax break could save millions of people up to £ 1,600 a year			2
in the @entity19 study researchers also found that a single person on the national average salary of £ 34,000 is better off than 83 per cent of the @entity2 population after tax			2
but a couple with two children and a full time parent is only 40 per cent better off after tax			0
today the government was urged by @entity55 , the @entity57 social policy charity who helped finance the research , to adapt @entity2 's tax rules to help hard - working families who are currently losing out			1
' @entity2 one earner married couples with children carry a far greater tax burden that the @entity19 or @entity67 average wage			1

too tough : campaigners are calling on the @entity75 , pictured , to ease the tax burden on hard - working families ' at all income points one earner families are lower in the income distribution than singles and couples without children			1
this cruel anomaly in the tax system is hurting families at a time when they need all the support they can get			0
' the government is planning to raise the personal income tax allowance to £ 10,000 but mrs @entity68 says that this is not necessarily the best way to support low and middle income families as it still favours the rich			0
former @entity95 chancellor under @entity96 , @entity97 , will launch the report tomorrow and also claim that the @entity99 is hurting many @entity2 families and not helping them enough			2
it is still women who predominantly stay at home in the majority of @entity2 families with one breadwinner			0
but the number of house - husbands has tripled over the past 15 years and 14 per cent of families with children now have a father with the main responsibility for looking after the children .			0

the average tax rate for one - breadwinner families in rich countries is around 6 **%** but nearly 10 **%** in the @entity2
a couple with two children and one working parent is also significantly *poorer* than a single @entity124
