by @entity0 published : 14:59 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 14:59 est , 3 november 2013 a 20ft long photo montage of the @entity3 coastline taken by daring @entity5 pilots two months before @entity6 has sold for more than Â£ 3,000			1
the brave airmen risked death to take the pictures , which were all snapped in broad daylight while flying just 10ft above the ocean			1
the annotated images show @entity14 beach , which was one of the three beaches stormed by @entity18 troops as part of the attacks on june 6 , 1944			0
the 20ft long panorama is made up of 21 plates each measuring 8in by 11in and shows @entity14 beach , one of three beaches stormed by @entity18 troops on june 6 1944 the annotated pictures picked out important landmarks , towns , @entity29 gun emplacements and beach exits the archive is made up of 21 plates , each measuring 8in by 11in			1
when pieced together they make a panorama that is almost 20ft long			0
officers studied them to familiarise themselves with the landscape and to look for where @entity29 gun emplacements and beach exits for the soldiers were			0
they would also have been used to create highly detailed maps and three dimensional models of the @entity6 landing zones			2
@entity5 pilots were forced to photograph the entire coastline from @entity3 all the way up to @entity46 in order to keep the eventual location of the landings a secret the montage was used to prepare for when @entity18 troops landed on @entity52 during @entity53 ( pictured ) this set of photos shows the town of @entity56 which was part of the @entity18 landing zone marked on the pictures , which cover the coastline from @entity62 to @entity63 , are landmarks including a tower , a lighthouse and a coastguard station			1
they have now been sold by the son of captain @entity70 , commander of infantry landing ship @entity71 during @entity6			1
the ship carried two companies from the @entity75 onto @entity52 , where they went on to capture their targets of @entity62 and @entity78			2
the small town of @entity80 sits just north of @entity81 and was captured by @entity18 troops on the day of the landings gold beach was just one of five target zones , including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
here @entity91 land on @entity89 the collection belonged to the son of captain @entity70 who landed troops onto @entity52 in this ship during the attacks the pictures would have only been seen by the highest ranking generals and used to make 3d models @entity99 , curator of the photographic archive at the @entity101 , said the spy photos were taken in march 1944			0
mr @entity99 said : ' highly - skilled pilots would fly very low level missions in @entity105 , @entity106 or @entity108 planes to get the photos @entity110 were very dangerous sorties			2
' the pilots not only faced the possibility of attack from @entity29 planes and flak from ground troops but also the inherent dangers of flying 10ft above the waves			1
the 20ft long sequence fetched eight times its estimated value when it went on sale @entity53 , or @entity6 as it has become known , is the largest invasion ever to have taken place and required a huge amount of planning ' the planes had cameras mounted in the noses and it was vital the pilots got pictures of every inch of coastline			2
' to avoid arousing suspicion among the @entity29 as to where the landings were going to take place , photos were taken of the coastline from @entity3 right up to @entity139 and @entity46 ' these particular photos show the @entity14 area from @entity62 - @entity142 to @entity63			1
' they would have been seen by only the highest ranking officials and from them highly detailed maps and 3d models were drawn out and handed to officers			0
' these photographs formed a very significant part of this historic mission			0
' the panorama fetched eight times its pre-sale estimate at @entity154 auctions in @entity155 .			0
