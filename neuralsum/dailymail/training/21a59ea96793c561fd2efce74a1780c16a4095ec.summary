the raider will be declared ' out ' and will not gain the point if he inhales before returning to his side , or returns without touching an opponent			0
the tagged defenders will be ' out ' if they do not succeed in catching the raider who tagged them			0
defenders may not cross the centre line ( the ' lobby ' ) of the field and the raider may not cross the boundary lines			0
however , there is one bonus line which can grant extra points for the raider if he manages to touch it and return successfully			0
