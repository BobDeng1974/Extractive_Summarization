for that we decided to stay here after the game in @entity7 and train here on friday , ' said @entity12			1
' it ’s very important to sleep well after the game , to eat well , to recover , because sunday is another final and we need to provide the players with all the best things to arrive fresh on sunday			2
' i have clear idea for thursday			0
always for us the most important game is thursday and we need to be focused on the @entity4 game not on the @entity6			1

nothing special , ' said the @entity0 boss			2
' i told you before the first game in @entity64 about @entity65 , is a coach who seems a little bit @entity67			0
playing with a lot of @entity67 players and the way they play is very similar to us because always try to play on the grass and always thinking on the opponent goal			0
we have a similar style , similar philosophy			0
' @entity39 wheels away in celebration having fired @entity0 into an early lead at @entity35 last week @entity15 , scoring in @entity0 's 5 - 3 win over @entity10 on january 1 , will hope to defeat the @entity80 on sunday it ’s been a damaging fortnight for football with several race and violence related incidents hitting the headlines but the @entity0 manager is adamant the @entity0 fans will conduct themselves in the appropriate manner in @entity1 : ‘ our fans are very respectful			1
in the few games we ’ve played before in the @entity3 in @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , the behaviour of our fans was great fantastic no problem , ’ added the @entity91			2
‘ maybe because i think it ’s better to be careful but our supporters always in the past in the last three games behaviour was fantastic			0
