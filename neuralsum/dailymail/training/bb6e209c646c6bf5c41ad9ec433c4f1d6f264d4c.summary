@entity1 keeper @entity0 claims other players are ready to step into the breach to fill the void left by @entity6 's three - match suspension			1
@entity6 will miss all his side 's games in october , starting against his former side @entity9 on sunday and including @entity11 's trip to @entity12 , after being sent off during @entity1 's 2 - 1 @entity14 win over @entity15			1
@entity16 , speaking at the launch of @entity1 's first global sustainable technology partner @entity19 , said : ' of course he 's a really important player for us and he 's the captain but we have other players ready to play these games			2
@entity0 claims other players are ready to step up during @entity6 's three - match suspension the @entity25 goalkeeper was with @entity26 ( right ) at @entity12 on monday afternoon ' we have a very important game on sunday			1
we won very important points against @entity15 with 10 players in a difficult match and if we win against @entity9 we 'll be in a good position in the table			0
' @entity33 ( @entity34 ) is the next captain and i think he will be a great captain			0
' of course it was a red card but @entity6 is a top player and i think he has to keep going			2
' @entity1 's wobbly defence has conceded 13 goals in seven matches since the start of the season and @entity16 admits that improvement is needed , but that a succession of injuries have disrupted the back - line			1
given the firepower up front however , with @entity6 , @entity26 , @entity47 , @entity48 all world - class players , @entity16 says a good defence is now the key			2
he added : ' we have had a lot of injuries this season and it is difficult when you play with a different back four but i think we have a lot of good defenders			0
@entity6 was given his marching orders by @entity63 for kicking @entity64 against @entity15 ' we have to play well and defend well - we know we have great strikers and midfielders so if we defend well we will win the games			1
' @entity16 said there was now a ' new era ' at @entity1 under manager @entity70 but that the demands remained the same			1
he also conceded it felt strange for the players not to be involved in @entity74 weeks			0
he said : ' it 's the same club but with different people			0
we need to look forward and try to win titles - we know we have to ( at least ) be in the top four and after this we will see if we can win the league and @entity81			0
' it 's strange for the team this week as this club has always been in the @entity74 and it 's difficult for us but now we have more time to prepare			0
' it 's a new era , a new manager and new players - everything is new but this is @entity1 and you have to win games and win titles			1
