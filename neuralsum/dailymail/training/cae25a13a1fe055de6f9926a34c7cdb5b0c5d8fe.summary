by @entity0 published : 02:38 est , 9 april 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 9 april 2012 @entity1 has banned @entity3 author @entity2 from entering the jewish state , over a poem in which he accuses @entity1 of plotting @entity7 's annihilation and threatening world peace			1
in his work called @entity11 , the 84 - year - old longtime leftist activist said @entity1 ' could wipe out the @entity7 people ' due to the threat it sees in @entity16 's disputed nuclear programme as well as labelling the country a threat to ' already fragile world peace			1
' the dispute with @entity2 , who only late in life admitted to a @entity23 past , has drawn new attention to strains in @entity3 's complicated relationship with the jewish state			2
travel ban : @entity2 poses with his poem - @entity1 has barred the @entity3 author from entering the jewish state , because of his work in which he accuses @entity1 of plotting @entity7 's annihilation and threatening world peace it has also focused unwelcome light on @entity1 's own secretive nuclear program			1
the poem has touched a raw nerve in @entity1 , where officials have rejected any moral equivalence with @entity7 and been quick to note that @entity2 admitted only in a 2006 autobiography that he was drafted into the @entity43 @entity23 paramilitary organization at age 17 in the final months of @entity45 @entity2 ' subsequent clarification that his criticism was directed at @entity1 prime minister @entity48 , not the country as a whole , did little to calm the outcry			1
furious reaction : @entity53 , announced yesterday that @entity2 would be barred from @entity1 , citing an @entity1 law that allows him to prevent entry to ex-nazis on sunday , @entity1 's interior minister , @entity53 , announced that @entity2 would be barred from @entity1 , citing an @entity1 law that allows him to prevent entry to ex-nazis			1
but he made it clear the decision was related more to the recent poem than @entity2 ' actions nearly 70 years ago			2
' if @entity65 wants to spread his twisted and lying works , i suggest he does this from @entity7 , where he can find a supportive audience , ' mr @entity53 said			0
@entity1 foreign minister @entity69 accused @entity70			2
the uproar has touched upon some of the most sensitive issues in modern - day @entity1 : the @entity75 , @entity7 's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons and @entity1 's own illicit nuclear program that is widely believed to have produced an arsenal of bombs			1
it also has unleashed a debate in @entity3 , where criticism of @entity1 is largely muffled because of the country 's @entity23 past			1
@entity2 ' most famous book , @entity86 , is about the rise of the @entity88 and @entity45 as told through the lives of ordinary people			0
he was awarded the @entity91 for literature in 1999			0
according to a biography from his museum in @entity3 , @entity2 has been in @entity1 at least once - notably accompanying chancellor @entity95 in 1973 on the first official state visit of a @entity3 chancellor to @entity1			2
@entity1 gained independence in 1948 in the wake of the @entity75 and became a refuge for hundreds of thousands of survivors of the @entity45 @entity23 genocide of 6 million @entity103			0
some 200,000 aging survivors still live in @entity1			0
the scars of the @entity75 have deeply influenced @entity1 thinking over the years			0
@entity1 marks a holocaust memorial day every year with a siren that brings the country to a standstill for two minutes			0
@entity1 's drive to maintain a powerful military has been shaped by the thought that its enemies want to repeat what the @entity88 tried to do			1
more recently , @entity48 has turned to @entity75 imagery in warning the world of the threat posed by a nuclear - armed @entity7			0
award winning ; grass ' most famous book , @entity86 , is about the rise of the @entity88 and @entity45 , it was also turned into a film , pictured			0
he was awarded the @entity91 for literature in 1999 in a speech last month to @entity129 @entity103 leaders , @entity48 said , ' never again will we not be masters of the fate of our very survival			0
' @entity1 , along with much of the international community , believes that @entity7 is trying to develop a nuclear weapon			2
the @entity1 fear a nuclear @entity7 would threaten its existence , given repeated @entity7 calls for the destruction of the jewish state , and have threatened to attack @entity7 if diplomacy and sanctions fail			2
aim : @entity2 ' subsequent clarification that his criticism was directed at @entity1 prime minister @entity48 , not the country as a whole , did little to calm the outcry a new round of talks between the @entity149 and @entity7 are set to begin this week in @entity150			1
rarely mentioned in the debate - except by @entity7 - is that @entity1 itself is widely believed to possess its own undeclared arsenal of nuclear bombs			2
that assessment , by foreign experts , is in part based on photos that were taken by a rogue technician at an @entity1 nuclear facility in 1986			0
@entity1 neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons and has refused to join the @entity162 , which would subject it to international inspections			0
grass ' poem took exception with @entity1 's alleged programme , and alluded to @entity3 's sale to @entity1 of submarines capable of firing ' all - destroying ' nuclear missiles into @entity7			1
he further outraged @entity1 by referring to their ' alleged right to the first strike that could annihilate the @entity7 people ' - even though @entity1 has not threatened the entire country , only its nuclear installations			1
grass ' poem has also opened up some delicate issues in @entity3			0
as a result of the country 's @entity23 past , @entity3 governments have made staunch support for @entity1 a cornerstone of their foreign policy , making the country one of @entity1 's most trusted allies in the @entity190			1
for decades , criticism of @entity1 was largely taboo , though that has begun to loosen in recent years , particularly when discussing @entity48 's hawkish stance on peace talks with the @entity195			2
remembrance : a @entity103 man looks at images of holocaust survivors at the @entity201 concentration camp			0
some 200,000 aging survivors still live in @entity1 and the scars of the @entity75 have deeply influenced @entity1 thinking over the years the government , however , has resoundingly criticized @entity2 ' poem			1
politicans , leaders of @entity103 groups and newspaper editorials have all accused grass of turning reality upside - down by labeling @entity1 the aggressor and @entity7 the presumed victim			1
the author was also openly accused of being anti-semitic , not least by the country 's conservative mass - circulation tabloid @entity216			0
writing in the newspaper sunday , foreign minister @entity218 became the first @entity221 member to react publicly to the controversy			0
' to put @entity1 and @entity7 morally on the same level is not intelligent , it is absurd , ' @entity218 wrote			1
a few voices have come forward to welcome @entity2 ' comments as a valuable contribution to public debate , by dragging @entity1 's nuclear arsenal into the spotlight and outlining the danger of a military confrontation with @entity7 - which could cause global economic and military mayhem			1
' it is a war that could plunge the entire world into the abyss , ' editorialist @entity235 wrote in @entity3 's top - rated news website @entity239 .			0

in his poem he wrote @entity1 ' could wipe out the @entity7 people ' with a ' first strike '
@entity2 ' subsequent clarification that his criticism was directed at the @entity1 prime minister and not the country as a whole , did little to calm the outcry
