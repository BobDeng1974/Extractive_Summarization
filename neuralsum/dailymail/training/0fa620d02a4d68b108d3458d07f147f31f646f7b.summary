but record high temperatures in march have left maple syrup producers in the @entity7 feeling as flat as a pancake			1
warm conditions are being blamed for bad - tasting syrup and a fall in supplies of up to 40 per cent			1
sweet or sour ? producers in the @entity7 say warm weather has given their maple syrup , usually served with pancakes , a bad taste some sugar maple trees , which need freezing temperatures at night to sustain sap production , have dried up early while others have produced syrup with a poor taste			1
in northeastern parts of the @entity7 , where nearly all the country 's maple syrup is produced , sugarmakers traditionally gather sap during a six - week season from late february to early april before buds appear on the trees			1
but the 2012 season was cut short by the warmest march since records began in 1895			1
@entity33 , a sugarmaker in @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ' you take 80 degrees in march by golly it do n't help nothing			2
' we had quite a lot of off - flavored syrup			2
' i do n't think you 'd want to put it on a pancake			0
' feeling the heat : some sugar maple trees have dried up early while others have produced syrup with a poor taste @entity51 , owner of syrup distributor @entity52 in @entity35 , said trees that did not dry up prematurely ended up producing ' yucky ' syrup			0
' it was kind of a disaster , ' @entity55 said			0
maple syrup production has been increasing in the @entity7 over the past decade as a result of new technology and a rising number of trees in production			1
it takes about 40 gallons of sap , usually gathered from the tapped trees through plastic tubing using a vacuum system , to yield one gallon of syrup			0
short supply : the @entity7 is expected to produce 18million pounds of syrup this year , down from 30million pounds in 2011 @entity36 , @entity72 and @entity73 are the states which produce the most			1
syrup unsuitable for the breakfast table is typically sold for industrial purposes such as flavouring chewing tobacco or salad dressing			0
the @entity7 is expected to produce 18million pounds of syrup this year , down from 30million pounds in 2011 , according to a crop estimate report by @entity81 of @entity82			2
other uses : syrup unsuitable for the breakfast table is sold for industrial purposes such as flavouring chewing tobacco or salad dressing mr @entity81 's company , based in @entity87 , @entity88 , is one of the four largest maple processors in the @entity7 mr @entity81 said that , despite the shortfall , retail prices have risen by only 5 per cent this year			2
he said this was because the @entity94 has retained 38million pounds of syrup in reserve from a bumper crop in 2011			0
