by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 13:44 est , 21 november 2012 @entity1 had seen the ad just weeks before his wife @entity3 had a heart attack when @entity1 ’s alarm went off one chilly morning this february , it was n’t just to rouse him for work			1
the impeccably timed alarm also saved his partner @entity3 ’s life			1
she was having a heart attack and were it not for a tv advert he ’d seen a few weeks previously , she would n’t be alive today			1
mr @entity1 had seen ad starring @entity14 , telling members of the public how best to resuscitate a cardiac arrest victim			1
produced by the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , it recommends people hum @entity21 ’ alive and pump the patient ’s chest to the beat – around 100 to 120 times a minute			1
the clip shows @entity14 , reprising his @entity27 gangster persona , demonstrating the technique on a ‘ geezer ’ who has collapsed in an empty warehouse , while the @entity32 ’ 1970s hit plays in the background			2
the online training film since clocked up 2.4 million views and the charity has been flooded with amazing stories of survival			2
professor @entity40 , medical director at the @entity19 said : ‘ the great thing about @entity42 - only @entity41 is you do n’t need any special skills or to remember how to do the kiss of life			2
' it ’s simple , you ca n’t do any harm and you may well save a life			2
we know of at least 28 people who are alive today simply because the person standing next to them when they collapsed did what @entity14 told them to do in our advert			2
' the new guidelines were unveiled at the beginning of the year after experts found that giving mouth - to - mouth is often ineffective if performed by an untrained member of the public			2
it also gets in the way of the crucial chest compressions need to keep the victim ’s heart beating			1
and according to the charity , the sheer thought of having to blow into someone ’s mouth puts many of us off from even attempting resuscitation			2
the new guidelines state that people should ignore the breaths and give constant chest compressions 5 - 6cm deep ( 2 inches ) , just between the nipples , at the rate of 100 to 120 a minute			1
the breaths of air , or rescue breaths , are meant to fill the patients ’ lungs with oxygen – so you effectively breathe for them			2
the @entity19 says that patients should have enough oxygen into their body to survive until help arrives so it is more essential that helpers concentrate on the compressions to pump blood round the body			1
official figures show that survival rates for cardiac arrests are very low			0
some 30,000 people suffer from one outside hospital every year and only 10 per cent will recover and be discharged from hospital			1
mrs @entity117 , 43 , had no history of heart problems before the episode in february			1
and mr @entity1 , 49 , a joiner , had no idea anything was wrong until he woke and heard her making a strange coughing sound			1
he told @entity124 : ‘ i thought something did n’t sound right so i put the light on			0
i could see her eyes were open , her mouth was open but she was n’t breathing			0
i got her off the bed and onto the floor and the first thing i thought of was the @entity14 ad			2
’ mr @entity1 had seen the advert starring @entity14 on the tv a few weeks earlier			1
‘ i remember it being a good ad and i only watched it and paid attention because it had him in it			2
had it been a doctor in a white coat i would n’t have paid so much attention			0
i certainly never dreamt i ’d have to use it a few months later			0
' he added : ' what was miraculous – but also terrifying – was the timing			0
if she had n’t coughed at the time my alarm went off i might never have spotted she was in trouble			0
' normally we do n’t speak in the morning because i get up so early and she ’s still sleeping			0
if i had n’t spotted her , then the kids would have found her when it was too late			0
the timing was sheer luck			0
' mr @entity14 explains how members of the public should call 999 before checking if the collapsed person in breathing			0
then chest compressions should be performed to the beat of @entity162 he got @entity3 on to the floor and started chest compressions			1
‘ i kept doing cpr for five minutes and phoned for an ambulance			1
they told me to carry on while they were on their way			0
slowly i could see the colour returning to @entity3 ’s cheeks , so i knew it must be doing something right			1
' @entity3 arrested again after paramedics arrived and was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and received an implantable pacemaker and defibrillator			1
when she was discharged from hospital two weeks later , on @entity178 , mr @entity1 proposed			1
he said : ‘ after everything that had happened , it seemed like the right thing to do			0
’ the couple , who live in @entity183 , married last month			0
he added : ‘ @entity3 still ca n’t believe it			1
she went to bed feeling fine and woke up in hospital			2
she obviously does n’t remember anything about what happened that day			0
' mrs @entity117 , who works as a carer , said the couple had thought about playing the @entity32 song at their wedding , but had decided against it			0
she said : ‘ i just feel so incredibly lucky that @entity1 saw the ad			1
’ the @entity19 says if survival rates from cardiac arrest are to improve then more bystanders need to help by doing cpr			0
the charity is now bringing back the popular @entity14 advert and releasing a new training film , starring @entity14 ( see below ) , to help promote hands - only cpr among the next generation of life - savers			0
@entity14 added : ‘ dozens of @entity206 are alive today because of hands - only cpr – and that ’s only the people we know about			0
but still not enough of us survive a cardiac arrest and it ’s seriously important that everyone knows hard and fast chest compressions to the beat of the @entity21 ’ alive by the @entity32 can be the difference between life and death			1
' whatever you do , tell your family and mates about @entity42 - only @entity41			0
it could turn out to be a life - saving decision			0
