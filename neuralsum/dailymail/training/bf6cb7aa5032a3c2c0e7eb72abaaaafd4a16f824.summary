' could have died ' : @entity1 's parents are still waiting for a doctor to call them back more than a week after calling the 111 @entity5 helpline a girl of ten could have died if her parents had relied on the controversial new @entity5 helpline , they said last night			1
@entity1 was ill with stomach cramps last saturday when her worried mother @entity11 phoned the service that is being piloted in her area			1
she spoke first to a call - centre worker , then to someone else with some medical training – who assured her a doctor would phone back within two hours to assess the little girl and possibly to arrange a home visit			1
but more than a week on , the doctor has still not called and if mrs @entity23 had followed @entity5 advice her daughter could have died			1
for when @entity1 's condition worsened , her parents drove to hospital themselves			1
within two hours , the youngster was diagnosed with potentially fatal appendicitis and her ' very inflamed ' appendix was removed			1
last night @entity1 's parents added their voices to the growing concern over the introduction of the 111 service			1
doctors have warned lives could be at risk , saying some of the £ 16,000 - a - year call - centre workers who are manning the phone lines are only partially trained			2
as well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed , there have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with hiccups			0
the call - centre staff simply work through computer checklists to ascertain the seriousness of each call			2
the idea is the new service combines the long - running @entity55 helpline with local emergency out - of - hours services			1
but staff have been recruited for as little as £ 8 per hour to man the phone lines			0
job adverts suggest they require no medical experience but should have telesales experience and typing skills			0
controversy : @entity1 's parents added their voices to the concern over the 111 service ( library image ) the @entity68 has called for the introduction of the service across most of @entity71 to be delayed until problems are resolved			1
those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at all , and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms			0
they may then be referred to speak on the phone with nurses or doctors if necessary			0
already in operation in 22 @entity5 regions , @entity5 111 is due to ' go live ' across the @entity86 and @entity87 area tomorrow and in a further 13 areas over the coming month			2
@entity1 's father @entity89 , who lives with his wife , three daughters and young son in @entity93 , said : ' when my daughter had stomach pains last saturday , my wife dialled 111 and they told us a doctor would phone back within two hours			1
' they still have n't phoned back yet			2
we took her to accident and emergency in the end , and within two - and - a - half - hours of @entity1 being seen by the triage nurse , she was being operated on			1
' the 111 service was awful - they did n't know who was doing what			1
if we had solely gone on what they said , potentially she could have died			0
' mrs @entity23 , a housewife , said : ' when i dialled 111 they asked me lots of questions			0
because she had banged her head with a boy in her class , they were more interested her a non-existent head injury than the pain in her abdomen			0
concerns : doctors have warned lives could be at risk because some staff are only partially - trained ' she 'd been sick as well , and that can be another sign of a head injury - but of course it is also a sign of appendicitis			0
the first guy i spoke to said he was going to be a clinician to phone back , and about ten minutes later someone did			0
' she tried to get us an out - of - hours appointment at 9.30pm last saturday , but could n't get us one until the next day , so said “ i 'm going to get an out of hours doctor to phone you , and if he thinks it necessary he 'll come out and assess her ”			1
that was eight days ago			0
a doctor still has n't called back			2
' @entity1 was kept in hospital until monday , and has made a full recovery			1
a spokesman for @entity71 , the body managing the @entity5 service 's introduction , said : ' this is a very important service for the public and we will make sure everything is in place to make a safe , high quality service that patients and the public can trust			2
' many sites are already up and running , but in areas where @entity5 is not yet available we will make a thorough assessment of readiness before new sites are introduced			0
' the public can be assured the areas that already have @entity5 will continue this service			2
in those areas where @entity5 is not yet in place they can ring @entity55 on 0845 46 47			0
all gp surgeries also have messages advising what to do			0

@entity1 's parents were assured a doctor would call back within hours
but more than week on , they have still not received a call from 111 service
the parents took @entity1 to hospital themselves as her condition worsened
the youngster was diagnosed within hours and has had appendix removed
