@entity5 had left the car to open the barrier at her work in @entity9 , @entity10 , when the would - be thief jumped in the driver 's seat and tried to make off			1
but when she saw the thief reversing away in her car , the 52 - year - old instantly raced over and began grappling with the man , refusing to let him leave			1
but , determined to reach him , she immediately gets up and throws herself towards the car , where she begins prising open the door			2
brave : @entity5 refused to give up as the man tries to reverse , mrs @entity5 is seen clinging onto the door , as it slams open and shut against her			1
despite the man fighting back , the determined mother is seen wrestling with him as she hangs half in and half out of the car			1
at one point , the man reverses so forcefully that mrs @entity5 is almost dragged under the front wheels			1
but mrs @entity5 soon regains her footage and carries on clinging to the vehicle as drives back and forth several times			1

today her daughter @entity57 said : ' she 's a little warrior			0
' she 's bruised all over but she would n't let go			0
she was saying " it 's my car , you ca n't have it "			2
' her passport was in her bag on the back seat because she was going on holiday this afternoon so she was determined not to let him get away with it			2
' the clip was taken from security cctv at @entity69 , which is near to @entity70 , where the incident took place			0

she said : ' @entity78 had gone into the office a little early because she was going on holiday to @entity81 later today and wanted to get some work done			0
' i do n't know whether the guy was watching the entrance to the car park or was an opportunist , but he took advantage when she got out of the car to open the barrier to leap in			2
' she told me she saw him and the adrenaline kicked in , she would not let the car go , she was like , " that 's my car , you 're not having it " especially as it had her passports in her handbag on the back seat			2
mrs @entity5 is seen clinging on to the door , wrestling with him as she is half in and half out of the car			1
at one point , the brave woman loses her footing and is almost dragged under the wheels of the car as the man reverses but she refuses to let go , clinging on right until the man has reversed into the nearby road ' she refused to let go even though at one point she almost went under the car			1
' this is not something she would normally , do , she is a little warrior , i 'm so proud of her , though she was stupid to risk being hurt			0

' my mum is bruised all over her body and in a lot of pain			0
she did n't want to go on holiday , and i think she will be in too much pain to enjoy it much			0
' she carries on as the man drives forwards again but - after a 30 - second grapple - the carjacker eventually gives up and jumps out of the driver 's seat he then flees from the scene , leaving mrs @entity5 shocked and bruised - but with her car in tact miss @entity5 said police were now trying to trace the thief			1
she begged anyone who might have seen anything to come forward			0
she said : ' there were lots of people waiting in their cars who saw the whole incident , although none of them bothered to get out of their cars to help or even called the police			2
if they had done , maybe he would have been caught in the act			0
' my mother did not see his face , which he was trying to cover , and he did n't speak			0
he was wearing gloves so there 's no fingerprints			0
but maybe someone recognises his clothes or the way he ran			0
