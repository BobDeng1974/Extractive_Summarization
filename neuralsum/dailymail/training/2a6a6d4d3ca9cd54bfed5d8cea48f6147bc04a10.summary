almost 36million people across the globe are living as modern day slaves where they are born into servitude , trafficked for sex work , trapped in debt bondage or exploited for forced labour			1
the @entity9 's annual slavery index last year estimated 29.8million people were living as modern day slaves with @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 among the nations where it is most prevalent			1
but the @entity20 - based human rights group this year increased its estimate to 35.8 million , in light of better data collection and slavery being uncovered in areas where it had not been found previously			1
for the second year , the index of 167 countries found @entity16 had by far the greatest number of slaves			1
@entity16 ( pictured ) has up to 14.3million people living as slaves , according to the annual global slavery report			1
stock image used @entity14 ( pictured ) is among the countries where modern day slavery is most prevalent			1
the country 's practice of sending poor children to stay with richer acquaintances routinely leads to abuse up to 14.3million people in its population of 1.25 billion were victims of slavery , ranging from prostitution to bonded labour			0
@entity12 was again the country where slavery was most prevalent by head of population while @entity15 , host of the @entity51 , rose up the rank from 96th place to be listed as the fourth worst country by percentage of the population			1
' from children denied an education by being forced to work or marry early , to men unable to leave their work because of crushing debts they owe to recruitment agents , to women and girls exploited as unpaid , abused domestic workers , modern slavery has many faces , ' the report said			2
' it still exists today , in every country - modern slavery affects us all			0
' the index defines slavery as the control or possession of people in such a way as to deprive them of their freedom with the intention of exploiting them for profit or sex , usually through violence , coercion or deception			2
the definition includes indentured servitude , forced marriage and the abduction of children to serve in wars			2
hereditary slavery is deeply entrenched in the @entity98 country of @entity12 , where four percent of the population of 3.9 million is estimated to be enslaved , the report said			0
after @entity12 , slavery was most prevalent in @entity13 , where citizens are forced to pick cotton every year to meet state - imposed cotton quotas , and @entity14 , where the practice of sending poor children to stay with richer acquaintances or relatives routinely leads to abuse and forced labour , it said			1
@entity15 ( pictured ) is among the countries to have a high numbers of slaves			1
it has a large number of migrant workers , often living in dreadful conditions , working on infrastructure for the @entity118 @entity13 forces its citizens to pick cotton every year to meet state - imposed quotas			1
pictured is a refugee camp on the border with @entity125 unsurprisingly , ranked fourth was @entity15			2
the tiny @entity127 state relies heavily on migrants to build its mega-projects including soccer stadiums for the @entity51			0
it has come under scrutiny by rights groups over its treatment of migrant workers , most from @entity131 , who come to toil on construction sites , oil projects or work as domestic help			0
the next highest prevalence rates were found in @entity16 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
the index showed that 10 countries alone account for 71 percent of the world 's slaves			0
after @entity16 , @entity152 has the most with 3.2 million , then @entity143 ( 2.1 million ) , @entity13 ( 1.2 million ) , @entity153 ( 1.05 million ) , @entity154 ( 834,200 ) , @entity144 ( 762,900 ) , @entity155 ( 714,100 ) , @entity156 ( 680,900 ) and @entity157 ( 475,300 )			1
for the first time , the index rated governments on their response to slavery			0
it found the @entity163 , followed by @entity164 , the @entity165 , @entity20 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 had the strongest response			0
countries such as @entity146 and @entity174 also registered increases in slavery following the atrocities committed by militant groups such as @entity179 ( pictured ) in the past year at the opposite end of the scale , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity146 , @entity184 , @entity147 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity13 , @entity144 and @entity174 had the worst responses			1
every country in the world apart from @entity182 has laws that criminalise some form of slavery , yet most governments could do more to assist victims and root out slavery from supply chains , @entity9 's head of global research said			0
' what the results show is that a lot is being done on paper but it 's not necessarily translating into results , ' @entity199 said			0
' most countries got 50 percent or less when we looked at the strength of their victim assistance regime			0
it 's also striking that ... out of 167 countries we could only find three ( @entity20 , @entity213 and the @entity165 ) where governments have put things in place on supply chains			0
' the report showed that conflict had a direct impact on the prevalence of slavery , she said , citing the example of the @entity226 militant group which has abducted women and girls in @entity174 and @entity146 for use as sex slaves			2
' what our numbers show is the correlation really is quite strong so as an international community , we need to make planning for this kind of problem as part of the humanitarian response to crisis situations			0
