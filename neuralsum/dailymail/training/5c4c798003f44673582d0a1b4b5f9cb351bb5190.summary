by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 19 november 2013 it was a night to sip fine wine and puff on fat cigars , savouring the rewards of a job well done			0
and as the crème - de - la - crème of @entity10 ’s bailiffs loosened their belts and bow ties after a lavish dinner at a four - star hotel in @entity15 , it was time for the evening 's big winners to step into the spotlight			1
as this was the @entity20 2013 , there should have been plenty of potential for unusual gongs			2
lavish : the @entity20 , held at the four - star @entity24 in @entity15 - where rooms cost up to £ 379 a night - was organised by @entity28 magazine and is now in its seventh year entrance : the event last wednesday was said by organisers to ' recognise the industry ¿ s outstanding efforts and commitment to best practice ' and give more than 500 people in the industry the chance to network in attendance : police officers were called to deal with a group of protesters but no arrests were made sadly , categories at the event dubbed the @entity46 did not include @entity10 ’s @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
instead organisers @entity28 took a far more sensible approach and opted for worthy - if rather disappointing - categories with not even a hint of the clichéd skulduggery of old			1
firms trooped across the stage last wednesday to collect awards for @entity57 , @entity58 from comedian @entity59 , star of @entity61 show @entity60			0
meanwhile , the real action was outside the £ 379 - a - night @entity24 where a bunch of anti-capitalist protesters were attempting their own rather different form of enforcement			1
outside : people were photographed in front of the prestigious hotel , which was built in the late 19th century smoking : the ceremony included a silent auction - where bids are written on a sheet of paper - in aid of financial education charity @entity76 , which raised more than £ 6,700 witnesses reported police being called to deal with a breakaway group who had infiltrated the imposing building , a 312 - bedroom hotel which dates from the late 19th century			2
however , by the time officers arrived after being called at 9.45pm , the group had dispersed and no - one was arrested			0
the @entity20 was established to recognise the ‘ achievements of professionals working in debt collection , enforcement , compliance and debt purchase ’ , according to publicity material			2
this year ’s ceremony included a silent auction – where bids are written on a sheet of paper – in aid of financial education charity @entity76 , which raised more than £ 6,700			0
people who have stayed at the hotel or visited in the past include former prime minister @entity102 , princess @entity103 , @entity104 , singer @entity105 and actress @entity106 .			0
