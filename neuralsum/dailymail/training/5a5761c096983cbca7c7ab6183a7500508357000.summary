from a kick - about in the local park to teaming up in a vital international years later is fanciful material usually reserved solely for the dreams of @entity5 youngsters			2
@entity6 and @entity7 are on the brink of pulling off the feat within six months			1
it was only back in april that @entity6 and @entity7 posed for a team picture with their then @entity12 buddies @entity14 and @entity15 at @entity16 in @entity17 after a jumpers - for - goalposts session			1
the former @entity20 flatmates will be reunited on monday , with the @entity24 squad ’s plush @entity22 training base their home for the week			1
@entity7 in action for @entity24 's under - 19 team and the youngster could star for the seniors soon @entity6 ( left ) celebrates during his time at @entity31 before moving to @entity32 then , on saturday , @entity6 and @entity7 could link up for the first time since going their separate , lucrative ways in the summer			1
@entity36 will be the stage when @entity39 ’s side goes out to secure a @entity41 qualifying victory against @entity42			1
around £ 6million changed hands for the pair during the close season			2
@entity6 , 20 , has starred for @entity32 in the @entity46 , while @entity7 is being brought along steadily with @entity48 ’s b squad since leaving @entity31			1
the 18 - year - old ’s tentative start to life in @entity52 did n’t stop @entity39 rewarding him with a first senior call - up last tuesday			1
the news came as a welcome surprise to @entity6 , who ca n’t wait to make a dream come true			1
‘ it would be brilliant to be out there playing in the same @entity24 team as @entity7 , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ we shared a flat together and were close at @entity31			1
we ’ve been away from each other and i would love to see him make his debut and earn a cap			0
‘ everyone loves playing for their country and we ’ve done it at the age levels			0
hopefully there ’s much more to come from both of us playing in the senior team			1
‘ it came as a surprise to see him named			0
i do n’t know if he knew or not and was just keeping it from me			0
but i ’m delighted for him			0
‘ it ’s brilliant he ’s taken a big step in moving to another country , learning a new language — i ’m sure he ’s looking forward to speaking to us @entity5 again ! ‘ he thoroughly deserves the call - up			1
i am sure he ’ll make a great impression and put his stamp on the training ground work that we do with the manager			2
’ @entity7 ’s promotion arrives only a month after he scored his first under - 21 goals , against @entity94 , the type of fast - track route with which @entity6 is familiar			1
he took all of two months at @entity31 to earn a call - up from @entity99 last october and , by early march , he made his debut for the senior team in a friendly victory in @entity103			1
‘ it would be brilliant to be out there playing in the same @entity24 team as @entity7 , ’ says @entity6 ( pictured ) @entity7 ( pictured ) and @entity6 shared a flat together and were close friends at @entity31 that does n’t indicate the @entity24 manager is acting in haste , however			1
@entity6 was , on occasion , borrowed for use in training games last season by @entity39 and , as he explains , the national boss is fond of using time off the coaching field to create a personal connection while a new young recruit is assessed among the establishment			1
‘ the most important thing is on the training ground , ’ said @entity39 , whose other uncapped call - up is @entity122 ’s @entity121			1
‘ can they play with good players or do good players intimidate them ? do they buy into what we are doing ? is their style of play all right for it ? ' and then , it ’s really about them			1
have they got a brother , a sister ? where are your mum and dad from ? just basic chat to get to know them better , before they come in cold			0
‘ i do n’t know too much about @entity7			1
i have seen him play but i do n’t know him as a kid			2
i ’ve never sat down with him , never had him in a training session			2
if you look at my squads , i like to have younger ones now and then			0
come on then , let ’s have a look at you , get together so , in the future , it ’s no big shock			2
’ that was an approach which sat well with @entity6 when he found himself propelled into the international arena a week before his 20th birthday and eight months after leaving amateur football behind at @entity158			1
‘ the most important thing is on the training ground , ’ admits @entity24 manager @entity39 @entity39 , the @entity24 boss , is fond of using time off the coaching field to create a personal connection ‘ if the manager decides it ’s time for @entity7 , one of the best prospects in @entity24 — if not the best — to come into the group and get started , then the timing must be right , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i think he ’ll deal with it and show what he can do on the pitch and in training			2
‘ when i got called in for the @entity103 game , it was quite daunting			0
i did n’t know anyone at that time			0
ever since i set foot in the hotel , the manager spoke to me quite a lot to see how i was doing			0
i talked to him and ( @entity24 assistant manager ) @entity180 in one - on - ones			1
' he obviously gains quite a lot from having those conversations and getting to know you a bit better on a personal level , what you are like off the pitch			0
‘ i guess he will do the same with @entity7			2
also , in team meetings , he gets it across so very well			0
everyone in the squad knows what he expects both as an individual and from the team			2
‘ i was lucky enough to make my debut in @entity103 and , hopefully , i repaid that trust on the pitch			0
’ a start against @entity199 in may followed that substitute appearance in @entity201 and , as a quickly established member of @entity204 ’s top - flight line - up , was all set to continue his rise through the ranks with a competitive @entity24 debut against @entity208 last month			1
@entity6 ( pictured ) says youngster @entity7 is ‘ one of the best prospects in @entity24 - if not the best ' @entity7 joined @entity52 club @entity48 from @entity31 in 2014 for a reported £ 3million potential @entity24 star @entity7 during a training session in @entity52 for new club @entity48 agonisingly , a calf tear 10 minutes from the end of his club ’s game at @entity217 put paid to his participation against the @entity220 winners			1
@entity6 dutifully turned up for @entity24 service in the vain hope of finding a way to make the plane but a scan confirmed all the fears that he would require a 10 - day rest			1
that injury strain was then put to the test by solo celebrations at his new @entity32 home when @entity233 ’s brilliant finish past @entity234 gave @entity24 hope of pinching an opening - night point from the section ’s most difficult fixture			1
‘ it almost made it harder being around the squad because i could feel the buzz and everyone was looking forward to the game , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i was desperate to get out there and get involved ahead of such a big game			0
it was unfortunate i could n’t			0
‘ the only positive was that i was n’t out too long and was able to get back for the next @entity32 league game			2
i caught the tear early and did n’t make it worse			0
‘ i was in @entity32 and watched it by myself in the house , cheering on the boys			2
i wished i was back in @entity24 to see it in a local pub or something and see all the reactions			2
i was ok , i was out the squad and there was nothing i could do about it			0
but it was harder watching and knowing i could have been involved			0
i thought the boys did brilliantly			0
@entity6 hopes to make the @entity208 match but a scan confirmed that he would require a 10 - day rest ‘ i thought “ @entity265 ” scored an amazing goal because you saw him running through and , having all that time to think about being one - on - one with perhaps the best goalkeeper in the world , then he kept his composure			1
it was unfortunate we could n’t hold on to a point			0
maybe it just shows in the end when it ’s world - class players like @entity278 you ’re up against and he scores two goals			2
’ @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 were among the @entity220 stars @entity6 was confronted by last weekend against @entity284 when , after an encouraging start to the season , @entity32 met with their second defeat of the campaign			1
the @entity289 has certainly not looked out of his depth , though , as he adjusts to the step up in class — his trademark raids up the left flank and unerring deliveries into the penalty box have transferred themselves to his new environment and even provided the opener in saturday ’s 2 - 0 defeat of @entity301			2
he will bring solid @entity303 top - flight form to the left - back position for @entity24 ’s matches against @entity42 then @entity103			1
‘ i have not put in a complete performance yet , ’ he continued			0
‘ hopefully i can do that soon but so far i ’m pleased			0
it ’s a great league to play in and i ’ve enjoyed every game			2
but i know i can show a lot more			0
‘ the manager has been brilliant with me , helped me through a lot already and tweaked things in my game			0
i know i ’m still young , so that ’s what has to happen			0
‘ i ’d say the tempo would be the biggest difference and it ’s much more physical			0
so i need to work on my fitness , be a lot quicker			0
i ’m learning a lot with better players around me			0
‘ i ’m trying in the gym to build up and get stronger but i do n’t want to do too much too soon			0
it ’s a gradual improvement we ’re looking for and i ’ll just keep on doing my program and , hopefully , see the results			0
