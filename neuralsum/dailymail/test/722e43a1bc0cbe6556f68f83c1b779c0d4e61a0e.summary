@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with his latest column for @entity3			2
the @entity5 manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season			1
taking the biscuit just a few days ago an old friend of mine @entity13 , the winger who played for @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 not the @entity18 president , visited @entity5 and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office			2
after training , to help me get rid of them , i decided to give some out to our players			1
the first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of @entity30 and a chat			2
i asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on , around the group			2
i kept repeating it , each time : take one and pass it on , take one and pass it on			1
one player did n’t want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on			2
@entity45 believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season			1
i stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he had n’t taken a biscuit			2
this was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach ’s direction			1
i did n’t tell them to eat it - i told them to take one and pass the pack on			2
the other six were looking at their biscuits waiting for the go ahead			2
i passed the packet back to the player and he now took his biscuit			2
i let them all know they could eat if they like , and if not return it to my desk , and shook all their hands as they left the room			0
when it comes to this crucial stage in the season , you need all your troops ready to follow orders			1
it ’s a zayn if they ’re not pulling in one direction at whatever level it ’s always important to have all your players going in @entity91			1
just like the band , if you ’ve got one person wanting to go a different way , do a different thing , something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken			0
at the business end of the season , it is so important that they are working as a team			0
people have to do their jobs ; defending set plays , defensive shape when you ’re attacking , working up and down the pitch			0
you need good captains and leaders within your group			0
people like @entity113 , who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that @entity117 squad follows @entity119 ’s guidance out on the pitch			1
it is @entity91 , or no direction			1
captain @entity113 works hard to ensure everybody at @entity117 is heading in the same direction on the @entity125 having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important			1
but the players out of the team , on the periphery , can lose you matches			1
negative body language , people unable to cope with not playing , disruptive comments , and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad			1
the man - management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the @entity144 or courses put on by the @entity146			1
i ’ve spent the last three - and - a - half years working with a guy called @entity149 , who runs @entity150 based up in @entity151 , on man - management skills for my players , my staff and of course myself			1
he deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies			0
@entity0 won a championship with @entity161 and is hoping to soon do the same with @entity5 since then , i have one championship in the bag at @entity161 and hopefully by the end of this month would ’ve bagged a second			0
without @entity167 this would not have happened			0
@entity119 is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side			1
he knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him			0
players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing			1
@entity178 … one person i keep hearing about … @entity182 @entity182 is winning so many games and doing so well at @entity184			1
he has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the @entity190			1
he did a tremendous job at @entity192 and back then there was no doubt in my mind , having played against his teams over the last couple of years , he would go on to manage at a much higher level			0
he must 've asked me at least one hundred questions when my @entity161 team visited @entity201 the week after winning the championship			0
he was like @entity203 , the old @entity205 presenter - non-stop firing questions at me			0
he was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with @entity161 from a team that had previously been mid-table			0
for me , he ’s heading for the top			1
@entity0 believes @entity184 manager @entity182 is going to go all the way to the top one thing i ’d change about … perceptions in football at @entity5 last summer , i found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people			1
i took on @entity220 , born in @entity221 , as a player - coach			0
i was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother			0
on top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games , winning a promotion , the @entity233 and been in numerous playoff finals			1
he also has a @entity236 coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called @entity238			0
i took on another player - coach , goalkeeper @entity239 , an @entity239 , who has four impeccably behaved children , who runs the @entity241 for youngsters and a high - end executive travel company with his wife , who can build patios and brick walls alongside his @entity236 coaching licence			0
former @entity16 goalkeeper @entity239 has been working alongside @entity0 as a coach at @entity5 then i was introduced to a young man called @entity252 who moved to @entity253 from @entity254 and wanted to be my analyst			0
he works hard and has been a real help			0
he works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly			0
we have a 23 - year - old female physiotherapist , @entity259 , who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time			1
she is calm , quiet , well - organised , disciplined , structured and i am very happy all the players are being so well looked after			1
i did not take on a @entity221 , an @entity239 , an @entity264 or a female because of their nationality , or skin colour or gender			0
i took them on because they ’re good at their jobs , they are good people , with good personalities and they have excellent characters			0
i ’m very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the @entity282			1
without them we would not have been top of the conference for so long			1
the big issue … @entity287 coming out of the dark ages			0
when i was a little boy watching @entity287 versus @entity289 in the front room with my dad , the amazing @entity291 , who @entity292 called a ‘ clown in gloves , ’ stopped @entity287 qualifying for the 1974 @entity296 with his heroic performance in goal			0
the panel of pundits , all those years ago , said we ’ve got to change			1
we ’re not playing the type of football other countries play ; our children do n’t get coached to be good technical players like other nations			1
over the years i ’ve heard it time and time again			2
especially over the last few years with the @entity311 dominance , people asking why we have not got the @entity312 and @entity313 of this world on our shores			0
@entity0 believes @entity316 is the man to help find the @entity317 and @entity313 of the @entity287 game the @entity146 ’s technical director now , @entity319 , appointed by my old chairman @entity316 , is a forward - thinker who can finally make some changes			2
he may never have played a professional game in his life , but at @entity326 he implemented a modern football structure at the club , where the manager does not have to deal with everything , where other departments and professionals are involved			2
@entity316 speaks to @entity282 chief @entity333 ahead of his @entity146 council meeting @entity319 can handle himself well			0
at a @entity339 training day a couple of years , at a hotel near @entity337 , one sunday afternoon , speaking just before @entity340 , @entity319 faced a roomful of sceptical , old - fashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward			0
the gave him a torrid time with their caveman - like mentality that the manager should run the whole club			2
he handled the room carefully and skilfully and i think @entity316 has put @entity287 football into the right hands			2
he is the right man to take @entity287 back for their second @entity296 win .			0

@entity45 believes it *'s* a crucial time for troops to follow orders
players like @entity113 ensure whole squad is pulling in same direction
perceptions in football need to change and they need to change *quickly*
@entity184 boss @entity366 is heading all the way to the very top
