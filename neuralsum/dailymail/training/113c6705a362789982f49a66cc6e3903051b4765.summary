by @entity0 @entity1 is a duck who is now able to waddle freely like any other - thanks to a 3d - printed left foot			1
@entity1 was hatched at an @entity6 , @entity7 , high school with his left foot turned backwards			1
it meant he was unable to walk or swim properly			1
it also caused him a lot of pain			2
the school contacted the @entity15 sanctuary , where founder @entity16 saw the deformity and decided to do something about it			1
because the foot needs to be flexible , the usual plastics used in 3d printing would not be viable			1
so instead , the company scanned the left foot of @entity1 's sister @entity44 and printed a 3d mould which was then used to cast a silicone foot for the lucky duck			1
the new bright orange prosthetic foot and nylon sock that @entity1 wears is n't quite as flexible the real thing but it does mean that @entity1 can now walk and swim in way he never has been able to before			1
printing the replacement foot took just over 13 hours			2
chicked off : buttercup the duck was hatched with his left foot turned backwards and seemed destined to hobble as he waddled the future is now : the 3d design and molding process for @entity1 the duck 's new foot webby to wear : thanks to cutting - edge 3d printing technology , the little duck now has a brand new webbed prosthesis ' it 's different for him because his leg is taller than it used to be when he just had the peg , ' @entity16 told @entity71			1
' his muscles will have to adjust , but i 'm amazed at how well he 's doing right off the bat			2
' mr @entity16 is already discussing what the next steps will be in @entity1 ’s prosthetic work			1
a new scanner will allow engineers to scan the current prosthetic , then edit its design in a computer program			0
he still is amazed at how well the original prosthetic has worked for @entity84			0
does this meet your approval sir ? buttercup the duck is shown his new @entity22 printed foot for the first time ' there was always the big unknown of whether or not it would work and if he would accept it			2
if he did n’t like the prosthetic and would n’t walk on it , it would n’t have mattered how many times i changed it			2
' @entity102 , the @entity22 engineer who printed the prototype for @entity1 ’s foot , said he also was amazed that the first trial of the prosthetic worked			1
mr @entity102 often works on manufacturing projects , and even some medical projects			0
he said 3 - d printing sometimes gets a bad reputation because of the media ’s focus on the printing of weapons			0
' that is n’t the point , ' he says			0
' the point is to help people - or even animals - improve their quality of life			0
' ' it ’s extraordinary to work on something that will actually benefit someone , even if that someone is a duck , ' @entity102 said			0
' it could be a person benefiting like this in the future			0
' wobble instead of a waddle : as @entity1 grew bigger her trouble with her deformed foot became more apparent @entity22 for free : with the help of @entity137 , a 3d modelling company that donated its services , a new mould was made for a silicone foot for @entity84 advances in the development of 3d printers have been revolutionizing the way objects can be created			1
recently , @entity146 scientists printed tiny batteries as small as a grain of sand , from interlocked stacks of miniscule electrodes			0
brides in @entity153 are even paying to have themselves printed in @entity22 on their special day so they can be immortalised on their wedding day			0
@entity155 about it : @entity1 will now be able to walk and swim properly at the @entity157 in @entity7 clothing , shoes and other fashion accessories have been printed using machines around the world			1
in the medical field , the fascinating machines have been used to print life - saving medical devices , changing the way health experts approach thinking about diagnostics and devices and prosthetic limbs			0
doctors have saved the life of a toddler whose airway had collapsed by printing him an airway splint , in just one day			0
however , 3d printers have also raised a serious ethical debate about the limits of what can be produced , after bullets and gun parts were printed in the @entity146 .			2

@entity1 was hatched last year in a high school 's *biology* *lab*
he was born with a backward left foot
it was *amputated* in *february* because he could not walk well on it
carer @entity16 decided to find a way to help him walk and swim again
using a 3d printer , a mould was been made of his foot and now a silicone one has been *attached*
