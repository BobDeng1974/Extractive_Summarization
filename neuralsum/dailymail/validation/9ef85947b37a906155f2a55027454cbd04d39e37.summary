a man who tipped the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the @entity6 in order to lose weight			1
@entity9 , 45 , from @entity10 suffers from lymphangitis - a painful swelling of his legs - and is at risk of diabetes because of his size			1
he struggles with his mobility and has had to have hand rails and extra banisters fitted around his home to help him use the stairs			2
he also needs straps to help him lift his limbs into bed and ca n't put his own shoes on because of his girth			2
he said gastric bypass surgery , which costs £ 9,000 on the @entity6 , is his only hope			1
' i have always been a big guy			2
from the age of 13 a lot of drink and food			2
i reckon lager had a lot to do with the weight initially , ' he explained			1
' i do n't want people to feel sorry for me			2
i have lost weight and it 's the easiest thing in the world to put it back on			1
all i am looking for is help to keep it off by restricting what i can eat			2
' he says his problem with food is an addiction and he should be supported in the same way people are when they try to give up addictions to cigarettes and alcohol			2
' especially in @entity28 we live in a fried culture , everything is fried and greasy or fat , usually that stuff tastes the best			2
there 's not enough healthy options out there			0
' it 's an addiction , all i want is that wee bit of help			0

@entity9 shares his story on @entity75 show nhs : £ 2bn @entity74 which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat @entity9 , who has been married to wife @entity86 for 30 years , has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the @entity6 in @entity28 for a third time			1
he ca n't afford to pay for the op privately as he was made redundant from his job at a delivery company two years ago and is now on benefits			0
he said : ' it all boils down to money			0
your life means nothing if it costs too much			0
' he admitted he knows people watching will think he does n't deserve to have the operation on the @entity6			1
but in the long run , it could save @entity6 funds as they would n't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future			1
professor @entity111 , a bariatric surgeon who treats both @entity6 and private patients , agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the @entity6			1
he said : ' i know a lot of people wo n't have any sympathy for the sort of patients i treat but these people have real problems			0
they are not a little bit chubby wanting to look better , they are ill because of the obesity they developed			0
' i do n't care how or why they got it , i know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they ca n't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape			1
' this surgery is transformative for people 's lives , there are very few operations we do that can achieve that			1
' @entity144 added : ' if it stops me getting diabetes then it benefits me and them , those costs can then go somewhere else			0
' the show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the @entity6 to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater			1
there are children born with cerebral palsy who need @entity158 ( @entity159 ) - a procedure that can significantly reduce muscle stiffness helping them to walk more easily and reducing painful muscle spasms			0
@entity9 , who has been married to wife @entity86 for 30 years , has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the @entity6 in @entity28 for a third time meanwhile , @entity165 , 24 , from @entity166 , is one of thousands of women in the @entity168 in need of @entity171 treatment in order to fulfill her dream to become a mother			1
three cycles of @entity171 on the @entity6 costs £ 10,000 and @entity165 has been denied the treatment because her partner , @entity9 , 38 , a scaffolder , already has a child from a previous relationship			1
@entity165 is infertile thanks to getting an sti when she was a teenager and she said she 's heartbroken that @entity171 is her only chance to have a baby			0
she said : ' when i was younger i could n't wait to grow up and have a family			0
i have always loved kids so when you have been told you face a life with no children it 's pretty tough , you have to live with that every day , it 's not a nice feeling			0
' it guts you to think you were stupid enough to trust someone and they gave you an sti			0
and then to find out later in life that 's the reason you ca n't have children , it guts me			0
' i sometimes feel disgusted with myself			0
people make mistakes , i was young and stupid , it was not my fault			0
i did n't know he was sleeping with @entity207 behind my back			2
' it 's so hard , family and friends keep making announcements that they are having a baby and you are happy for them but deep down you 're gutted as it 's all you ever wanted			0
