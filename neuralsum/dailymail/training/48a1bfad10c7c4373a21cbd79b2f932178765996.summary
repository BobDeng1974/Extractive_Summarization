by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 18:20 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 : 23:54 est , 17 february 2014 @entity4 wants @entity5 to know that @entity8 minority leader @entity7 ' looks and fights like a turtle , ' and he hopes that image will bleed over to @entity13 sen. @entity12 â € “ the man whose job he wants			1
' we @entity5 do n't need a @entity19 turtle telling us how to fight , ' @entity4 says in his newest video ad			0
the slight is related to what @entity4 sees as a lack of action from @entity12 , the state 's senior senator and the @entity26 , to block elements of the @entity28			2
@entity29 , the junior senator , won national attention in september for monopolizing the @entity8 floor for 21 hours in a quasi-filibuster aimed at forcing changes to the @entity28 law as a condition of avoiding a government shutdown			0
' ' i 'm worried , and i 'm mad about that , ' the @entity47 darling continued			0
@entity4 will compete against @entity12 and a handful of other @entity8 hopefuls , including congressman @entity63 , in a march 4 @entity13 primary			1
if @entity12 should capture 50 per cent of the vote , he 'll be the @entity13 nominee to keep his seat			1
otherwise , the top two republicans will have to meet in a runoff on may 27			0
@entity69 , his spokesman , told @entity70 that @entity4 's stock is high since he ' has won ten out of ten straw polls ' in @entity73			0
' i like @entity75 soup , ' says @entity4 's golden retriever , @entity77 , in a voiceover -- and you ca n't even see the pooch 's lips move @entity12 ( r ) met @entity82 or @entity83 on feb. 12 , accompanied by @entity85 majority leader @entity84 ( @entity86 ) and the allegedly testudinal @entity87 ( 2nd @entity88 ) @entity4 's comparison of sen. @entity87 to a shell - covered slowpoke is n't new : the @entity91 popularized the idea in 2011			1
@entity47 chaos : @entity73 rep. @entity63 , another conservative @entity94 hopeful , met with trouble in january after his campaign photoshopped an image of president @entity98 to make it look like sen. @entity12 was in the picture with him @entity69 playfully told @entity70 that @entity4 's golden retriever , @entity77 , made the turtle identification on his own			1
he ' pointed to the tv when @entity7 was on , just like when @entity4 takes him hunting , ' said @entity69			0
' the resemblance was obvious			0
' in the @entity4 ad , a comic voiceover has @entity77 saying , ' i like turtle soup ! ' the risk of offending the @entity8 's top @entity13 is a serious one : if @entity4 were to upset @entity12 in march or may , and then go on to win the general election against a @entity85 candidate , he would enter the @entity8 with a party leader who might retaliate by relegating him to less - than - impressive committees			1
but @entity69 insisted it 's no big deal			0
' i think it 's more important that @entity7 and @entity84 pray that @entity4 does n't get to the @entity8 , ' he said , ' because no matter what assignments he 's given he will fight like you 've never seen against bigger government and more debt			1
' ' and besides , @entity120 is going to wipe the floor with @entity7 , ' he added , referring to @entity87 's own primary fight in @entity45			2
@entity12 's and @entity87 's offices did not respond to a request for comment .			2

the latest wacky @entity1 campaign ad comes from a @entity4 , a @entity73 **tea** partier who claims sen. @entity12 , the *incumbent* , is too moderate
the evidence : @entity12 's alleged *closeness* to minority leader @entity7 , the @entity8 @entity13 that **tea** *partiers* most love to hate
an insider - the - *beltway* *internet* meme compares photos of @entity87 with pictures of turtles
@entity12 faces a *crowded* field of @entity13 primary *challengers* , including @entity4 and rep. @entity63
if he can capture 50 per cent of the primary votes , he 'll avoid a @entity13 runoff and *leapfrog* *straight* to the *november* general election
