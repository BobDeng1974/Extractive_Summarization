the @entity2 ' frailties with the bat were cruelly exposed by the top - ranked @entity11 , with @entity0 leading the charge as he finished with six for 34 having gone wicketless in the first innings			1

@entity0 ( left ) celebrates after claiming the wicket of @entity21 during @entity5 's emphatic innings and 220 - run win over the @entity2 in the first test at @entity25 @entity0 acknowledges the applause of the crowd after his spell of six wickets for 34 guided the host to victory but a fired - up @entity0 sparked a precession of wickets as the @entity2 were bowled out for 131 , unable to cope with the hostility of the home quicks			1
@entity0 had limped off on the third afternoon with a groin problem but showed no signs of discomfort as he steamed in to skittle the @entity2 top order in a spell that lasted 90 minutes			1
@entity41 ( 39 ) edged behind to wicketkeeper @entity42 , before @entity21 ( four ) tried to evade a short ball that did not get up as high as he expected and gloved the ball to the keeper			0
that left the @entity2 in trouble , but their situation became a hopeless one when @entity49 looped up a catch for @entity51 off a rampant @entity0 with his score on 17			0
@entity2 batsman @entity53 plays a shot but their resistance was short - lived @entity0 celebrates again after removing @entity41 for 39 , @entity42 taking the catch captain @entity57 ( four ) , who had called for greater grit and application from the batsmen in the lead - up to the test , lasted just two balls as @entity0 claimed his fourth by inducing an edge off the shoulder of the bat to a leaping @entity67			2
@entity68 picked up his second wicket of the innings when he removed @entity53 ( 15 ) , who could only fend a rising delivery to substitute fielder @entity72 at short leg			0
the game was up for the tourists and @entity0 picked up the final two wickets , with @entity77 taking an easy catch off @entity79 at mid-wicket to end the game with bowler @entity82 not batting in the innings as he rests his injured ankle			2
the @entity2 were bowled out twice in the test in just under 103 overs , leaving them with much to contemplate ahead of the second test in @entity89 that starts on boxing day .			0
