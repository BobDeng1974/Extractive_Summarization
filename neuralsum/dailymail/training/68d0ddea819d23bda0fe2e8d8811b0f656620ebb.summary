by @entity0 a six - year - old girl who was confined to the house because her immune system was so weak can finally play outside thanks to a live - saving transplant - from her big sister			1
@entity7 was born with a disease which left her with no immune system , so even a trip to the beach or playing with friends could prove fatal			1
aged four , she was diagnosed with chronic granulomatous disease - a rare disorder where the immune system ca n’t fight infections , only suffered by just one in eight million girls			1
despite being fit and heathy , her older sister @entity18 , 8 , right , also suffered			1
she had to miss out on things in case she brought bugs back to the house - and also to prevent @entity7 , left , from becoming jealous close : @entity23 ( left ) has been saved by her big sister , @entity18 , who donated bone marrow spores from cut grass and leaves could have resulted in a fatal chest infection , and a simple cut finger could easily have led to deadly blood poisoning			1
her devastated parents , from @entity33 , @entity34 , were forced to pull her out of school and keep her indoors away from other children			0
despite being fit and heathy , her older sister @entity18 , 8 , also suffered			1
she had to miss out on things in case she brought bugs back to the house - and also to prevent @entity7 from becoming jealous			2
her mother , @entity43 , 39 , said : ' @entity7 basically had no defence against anything			2
we went through hell and back and she really suffered			0
' we always knew something was wrong - a common cold would turn into a chest infection , and a tummy bug would last for weeks			0
battle : @entity7 was diagnosed with the rare condition chronic granulomatous disease - a rare disorder where the immune system ca n't fight infections			1
this means going outside could have killed her ' she was constantly in and out of hospital with a huge variety of illnesses - almost losing her battle with a chest infection aged 16 months			0
' but it was n’t until an infection in her toenail resulted in a hospital admission and nine courses of antibiotics that doctors ordered more tests , in august 2012			0
the family were told @entity7 would need a bone marrow transplant “ sooner rather than later ” to survive - but that the procedure could kill her			1
mrs @entity7 added : ' it was a relief to know what was wrong but we were told it was pretty uncommon to find a perfect match , and even if we did there was a one in ten chance it would n’t work			1
it was a horrible time			0
brave : @entity7 first had to have ten days of chemotherapy to completely wipe out her own immune system , before she got @entity18 's bone marrow at @entity89 on august 30 last year luck : the family discovered @entity18 was a bone marrow match after a routine test to check she was also not suffering from the condition ' @entity7 could n't do anything			1
she could n’t go to the beach , to the forest , be near cut grass or wood - it was all too much of a risk of infection			0
' she could n’t even go to the shops or leave the house			0
' but , in a fortunate twist of fate , a routine test to check @entity18 did n't also sister @entity18 did n’t suffer from the same rare disease revealed she was in fact a perfect bone marrow match			1
@entity109 : the transplant has now been 98 per cent accepted by her little sister - giving her a brand new immune system - and the pair can play outside for the first time in years @entity7 first had to have ten days of chemotherapy to completely wipe out her own immune system , before she got @entity18 ’s bone marrow at @entity89 on august 30 last year			1
within days , their mother noticed a massive change in her youngest daughter			0
she said : ' @entity7 was so different - she used t obe very withdrawn all the time , and to look at her she was very pale , with dark circles around her eyes			2
transformed : @entity23 's transplant has been a success and she can now return to school ' within five days the colour was back in her cheeks			1
' the transplant has now been 98 per cent accepted by her little sister - giving her a brand new immune system - and the pair can play outside for the first time in years			1
@entity18 said : ' i feel quite proud about what i did			2
' before the operation we were all quite sad because i missed out on a lot of things - because @entity7 could n’t do anything			2
' now she is much happier and we can play out the front , we can go to @entity146 ’s and we are going on holiday			0
' before we could n’t do any of that			0
' @entity23 , who goes back to school after @entity150 , added : ' my sister was nice and kind when she helped me			2
i ca n’t remember how i felt before but now i feel quite alright			0
the best thing is playing outside her mother added : ' we are doing all the things people just take for granted			0
