two @entity1 reporters were able to drive through the outer security gates of a @entity4 nuclear power plant without being challenged , according to a report published tuesday			1
the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity4 , had an unattended and padlocked guard gate when journalists drove through – on two separate occasions			1
they easily accessed a parking lot within 550 feet of a working nuclear reactor without prompting any kind of contact with uniformed security			1
' no one stopped or even seemed to notice them , ' the @entity16 reported			0
terrorist jackpot : reporters with the online news website @entity16 were able to drive onto the premises of a @entity4 nuclear power plant and approach a working reactor without any challenge drive - thru : the @entity6 , just 50 miles from @entity1 , has an open front gate nuclear plants , including those on bodies of water , like the @entity6 facility , provide a tantalizing target for terror groups bent on causing mass - casualty events in the @entity36			1
but a previous visitor to the site told the @entity16 that the nuclear facility ' is the softest target i have ever seen in my life			1
' with a camera rolling , the journalists approached the front gate expecting to be challenged			1
but the guardhouse was padlocked shut and there was no security to be found anywhere			2
on their second visit , they saw a lone security vehicle driving around the premises but it drove right past them without any sort of inspection			2
and a large civilian delivery truck , more than amply sized to serve as a giant bomb , also rolled through the gates without anyone stopping it			0
the @entity63 oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants via commissioners appointed by the @entity68			2
@entity70 , a spokesperson for the agency , told @entity16 that ' based on the security inspections we 've conducted on an on - going basis , security at @entity6 is appropriate to protect the public health and safety			0
' it 's unclear how often those checks are performed , or if the @entity63 plans to ramp up its efforts following the embarrassing public report			0
but it has cited the plant 's ' security deficiencies ' before , in 2011 , without describing exactly what it found lacking			2
in an @entity88 / @entity87 poll released tuesday , more than 7 in 10 @entity36 said they think it 's likely that terrorists with the self - proclaimed @entity91 ( @entity91 ) are already inside the @entity36 and poised to attack the @entity36 homeland			0
@entity91 has cut a swath of torture , death and destruction through more than half of @entity98 and much of eastern @entity99			0
padlocked : the guard shack outside @entity6 was deserted and locked up the nuclear power plant is run by the @entity102 , which insists that it 's not required to post guards outside its nuclear plants ' grounds the @entity102 operates the @entity6 plant			1
its spokesman @entity108 told @entity109 that it 's ' not required ' to maintain manned checkpoints at all of its nuclear plants			0
he claimed @entity6 and the company 's other facilities are ' highly - secure , virtually impenetrable facilities			0
' ' the fences and checkpoints you see at @entity6 are only a small part of our defense in depth security strategy , ' @entity108 told the center - right online outlet			0
' in fact , much of our defense lies in the things you ca n't see			0
' he insisted that officers who used to man the front gate had been redeployed in a way that ' enhanced overall site security ' and ' increased safety for our officers			1
' an expert with the left - leaning @entity136 told the @entity16 that having a ' visible defense ' on the outer perimeter of a nuclear plant can make terrorists think twice about mounting an attack			1
the @entity143 report includes frightening descriptions of an @entity146 plot , ultimately abandoned , to attack an @entity36 nuclear power reactor			1
and a pair of @entity150 professors concluded in a 2013 report that the @entity36 risks ' deliberate sabotage of nuclear facilities , such as by aircraft attacks , vehicle bombs , anti-tank weapons , or the disabling of pumps by an insider or an intruder facilitated by an insider who disables locks and alarms			2
' ' terrorists may commit radiological sabotage to provoke public fear , showcase their ability to inflict societal harm , or potentially induce an energy crisis in areas dependent on power reactors , ' wrote the experts .			0

journalists saw a padlock on the guardhouse at a @entity4 nuke plant just 50 miles from @entity1
no one challenged them and they managed to get into a parking lot just 550 feet from a working nuclear reactor
facility is on the @entity187 but – no boat needed – any vehicle can zoom through the front gate without being noticed
