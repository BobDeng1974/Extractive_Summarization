@entity0 will appeal to the @entity1 to block a breach of privacy legal action launched against it in the @entity4 by a group of @entity4 internet users			1
the internet giant 's lawyers are seeking a declaration that the court has no jurisdiction to try their claims - which relate to the @entity14 internet browser			2
the @entity4 group , known as @entity16 against @entity0 ’s @entity17 , accuse the company of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements			1
does n't apply : @entity0 ( @entity4 headquarters pictured ) claims the privacy case can not be brought in the @entity4 the group includes editor and publisher @entity29 , with @entity30 and @entity31 , who are both it security company directors			1
they say @entity0 ’s ' clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among @entity4 users			1
they argue @entity0 ’s bid to block a trial is ' misconceived ' and the company should ' answer to @entity4 justice			1
' allegations against the company include misuse of private information , breach of confidence and of the @entity52			2
the users action group says the information was collected and sold to advertisers who used its @entity59 advertising service			0
@entity0 , the most dominant internet search engine site in the world , is powered from a site in @entity63 , @entity64			1
the company is multinational and therefore argues that the privacy claim should not be heard in a @entity4 courtroom			1
it is the latest controversy involving @entity70 's £ 170bn company after tax avoidance scandals @entity74 @entity73 , appearing for @entity0 , today argued the @entity4 claimants had failed to establish that their claims fell within one or more of the legal “ gateways ” which would allow them to go ahead			1
mr @entity79 told mr @entity80 that the only potential gateway available required there to be a real basis for concluding that the conduct complained of between summer 2011 - spring 2012 would be ' continued or repeated '			0
he said : ' there is no suggestion there is any risk of repetition or continuation of that conduct - and good reason to think that it will not be repeated or continued '			0
in written arguments before the judge , @entity0 , contends any damages recovered if the claimants win are likely to be ' very modest '			2
a trial would be likely to last six to seven days and cost in the region of £ 1.2m and be disproportionately expensive , it said			0
a trial was likely to be ' substantial and complex ' and involve a great deal of highly technical evidence about the operation of browsers , websites and cookies , it added			0
campaigner ms @entity107 said before the court hearing , expected to last two days : ' @entity0 is very much here in the @entity4			2
it has a @entity4 specific site			2
' it sells adverts here			0
it is ludicrous for it to claim that , despite all of this very commercial activity , it wo n’t answer to our courts			0
' if consumers are based in the @entity4 and @entity122 laws are abused , the perpetrator must be held to account here , not in a jurisdiction that might suit them better			2
' @entity0 ’s preference that @entity4 consumers should travel all the way to @entity64 to seek redress for its wrongdoings is arrogant , immoral and a disgrace			2
we will fight this attempt to dismiss the case robustly			0
' @entity135 , appearing for @entity14 users , said he rejected @entity0 ’s criticism that the claims being brought were uninteresting and made for ' trivial ' amounts			0
mr @entity140 told the judge : ' these claimants are holding @entity0 to account for what they have done			0
' he said no regulatory authority had taken action against @entity0 in the @entity4 , though there had been action in the @entity148			1
one of two @entity148 investigations related to the very breaches underlying the basis for the @entity4 court action			1
the @entity14 users wanted ' to find out what information has been obtained ( by @entity0 ) and how it has been used ' , said mr @entity140			0
privacy : claimants say the web giant has tracked their phones or laptops without permission ' we say there are very serious and important issues which relate to how @entity0 , a corporation of immense wealth and power , deals with private information and the individuals who use their services			1
' we wholly reject the idea these are trivial and uninteresting claims sounding in trivial sums and the court should not entertain them			0
' the attempt to bypass @entity4 privacy rules will further fuel controversy over how @entity0 tries to avoid regulation in overseas markets			1
@entity0 avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking @entity4 profits through its international headquarters in @entity181 - claiming profits from sales of online advertising for @entity4 companies should not be taxed here as its intellectual property is in @entity186 and the @entity148			1
but @entity187 , a partner with @entity188 , which is representing dozens of claimants in the lawsuit , has previously said : ‘ @entity0 has a substantial presence here and earns substantial revenues here			0
‘ this is yet another instance of @entity0 being here when it suits them and not being here when it does n’t			0
’ the claimants argue @entity0 ’s policies ‘ do n’t respect ’ @entity4 privacy laws			1
the lawsuit follows on from @entity0 being hit with a record £ 14.4m fine in @entity148 after the company bypassed the privacy settings found on @entity207 , iphones and @entity209			1
it also paid out a further £ 10million to resolve a related complaint			0
the privacy breach concerns @entity213 ’s search browser , called @entity14 , which is designed to block the software that allows @entity0 to track users ’ online			2
however , @entity0 disabled this safeguard between summer 2011 and spring 2012 without notifying those using it			0
earlier this year , a @entity4 judge granted permission for the case to go ahead			2
in its submission to the @entity1 , @entity0 ’s lawyers argued that any information gleaned from the search engine is not ‘ private or confidential ’ , meaning it has no obligation to keep it confidential			1
other internet giants , such as @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 , all offer some services through @entity233 bases - meaning there is some protection for users under @entity238 privacy laws .			0
