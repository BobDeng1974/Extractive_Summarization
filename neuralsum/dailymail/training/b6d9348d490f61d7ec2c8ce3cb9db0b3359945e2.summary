sir @entity12 has also criticised their determination to bring down immigration			1
in an outspoken article , he said that continuing to let the young subsidise the old was ‘ bad economics and bad social policy ’ – but governments were afraid to upset pensioners as they were more likely to vote			2
the former cabinet secretary , who served three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011 , questioned whether it was right that the elderly get free bus passes and prescriptions while public finances were so tight			1
writing in @entity28 , lord @entity12 also warned that the @entity7 will be in the ‘ global slow lane for years to come ’ and that its productivity performance was ‘ far from stellar ’			1
‘ the government ’s determination to bring down net migration may lower future potential output , ’ he said			2

as cabinet secretary , lord @entity2 was seen as being so powerful in @entity51 that he was nicknamed ‘ god ’			2

part of the problem , he said , was that ministers are too wary of powerful lobby groups who mobilise to prevent any effort to cut their benefits			2
‘ one obvious example is the plethora of special payments and perks given to the over- 60s like free bus passes or prescriptions , ’ he said			1
' should all over- 60s get free prescriptions ? ' questions lord @entity2			1
he says part of the problem was ministers are too wary of powerful lobby groups ‘ should all over- 60s get free prescriptions ? why are we paying winter fuel allowances to millionaire pensioners on the @entity86 ? ‘ this is all part of the ludicrous bias whereby the old are subsidised by the young			1
it is bad economics and bad social policy			0
unfortunately it has been judged to be good politics as the old have a higher propensity to vote			0
