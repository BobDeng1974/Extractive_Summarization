by @entity0 published : 02:40 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 05:30 est , 9 january 2013 it 's almost three decades since @entity2 had a @entity4 number one			1
but the master of reinvention enjoyed instant success yesterday after releasing a new single on the internet			2
where are they now ? appeared for sale on @entity13 at 5am and by the end of the day had topped its chart			1
the song ’s video had also been viewed 200,000 times on @entity19			2
@entity2 , the original @entity20 , dispelled rumours yesterday that his career was over with an out - of - the - blue release on his 66th birthday of his first new single in a decade			1
but for many fans , the relief that the iconic singer - songwriter still has all his creative faculties gave way , after the first couple of bars , to sadness			2
for millions – me included – @entity2 had once been the most exciting pop star of his generation ; now , judging by his new single , he has dwindled to little more than a pale echo of his @entity41 glory days			1
scroll down to watch back on the scene : @entity2 celebrated his 66th birthday on tuesday by releasing new track where are we now ? on @entity13 , while new album @entity46 will be available from march new video : the release of single where are we now coincided with a video by @entity53 , which shows the musician 's face projected onto the body of a puppet the four - and - a - half minute song , where are we now ? , appeared on his website without forewarning or fanfare early yesterday morning			1
the only publicity was a single message on @entity66 , inviting his followers to ‘ stumble upon ... a well - kept secret ’			2
within minutes , the news had travelled across the world , spread by the chattering of social media websites			2
it seems the man who once , as an unknown rocker in 1972 , hired a platoon of bodyguards to make himself look like a megastar on tour in @entity80 , has learned to appreciate the effectiveness of understatement			0
the surprise of fans and critics was all the greater because many thought the singer , still most famous for his @entity89 incarnation 40 years ago , had been brought low by illness and advancing years			1
legend : the video pays homage to the time @entity2 spent in @entity94 following a heart attack on stage in 2004 , @entity2 has turned down all invitations to play live , even refusing to attend the @entity99 opening ceremony last august , where his 1977 song heroes practically became the anthem to a summer of sporting success			1
a photograph taken on a @entity107 street in october , close to his apartment , showed a frail man , shuffling along in a flat cap and sweatshirt , clutching a paper bag that appeared to contain his lunch			0
it sparked fears the former drug addict and chain smoker was suffering from cancer or perhaps dementia			0
the new single at least reassures us he retains his poetic gift			2
in one poignant line he calls himself , ‘ a man lost in time , just walking the dead ’			0
with its stark piano chords and echoing drums , the single sounds like an out - take from his late - seventies albums , which were recorded in @entity94 , where he escaped in an attempt to recover from his cocaine addiction			2
he 's back : the new track is produced by long - term collaborator @entity135 and written by @entity2 breaking the silence : the unusual video pays reference to the time @entity2 spent in @entity94 , @entity139 , in the late 70s the video which accompanies the single emphasises the @entity94 connection , with grainy footage of the @entity139 capital projected on to a screen in a cluttered basement			1
in front of the flickering pictures of deserted streets and grimy statues , @entity2 ’s heavily - lined face materialises on a teddy bear , alongside the face of a woman set on another bear			1
yesterday internet chatter suggested that the woman may be the @entity157 singer @entity154 , who performed at @entity2 ’s 50th birthday party in 1997			1
others have intimated that she may be @entity160 , @entity2 ’s longtime personal assistant , or even the painter @entity162 , wife of the video ’s director @entity164			1
if there ’s a message hidden in the eerie video , we probably wo n’t be able to decipher it until the album – the @entity172 – goes on sale in march			1
although little is known about the album , the titles of the songs have been released to whet the appetites of fans : you will set @entity180 , @entity181 , dancing out in @entity182			2
comeback : @entity2 is releasing his first single and album in a decade boy @entity186 : ' @entity2 's new song has made me cry ! happy tears of course ! ' @entity191 : ' so is @entity2 goin back to blonde hair and pegs or that bugs bunny thing he 's been vockink for a while # bugsbowie			1
' @entity196 : ' happy 66th birthday to one of my all time musical hero 's @entity2			1
' @entity201 : ' @entity202			0
this is very very exciting news ! ! ! ' @entity205 : ' love this new @entity2 song ... still the classiest guy in world music			1
great to have him back			0
' @entity209 : ' he 'll yeah ! welcome back @entity2 ! @entity210 ! ! ! ! ! ' @entity212 : ' @entity2 showing it 's possible to be 66 and young			1
' legend : the star achieved success in the @entity80 in the mid 70s and scored a string of number one singles in the @entity4 throughout the 80s , before experimenting with a series of musical styles in the 90s glam rocker : @entity2 has n't released an album since reality in 2003 , while his last single to grace the charts was a cover of @entity231 track @entity229 @entity228 in 2006 @entity2 ’s son , the film director @entity232 ( christened @entity232 ) tweeted yesterday , ‘ first in ten years , and its a good ‘ un ! ’ but his enthusiasm may not be matched by all of his father ’s many fans			1
those titles appear to have been chosen by a random @entity2 song generator : an all too recognisable combination of his most hackneyed phrases borrowed from hits like : @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247			1
there will , of course , be a round of forced smiles and hearty reviews from middle - aged critics who grew up with the classic vinyl @entity258 : in other words , lifelong fans like me			0
it ’ll be the same respectful applause and worn - out praise that greeted new albums last year from @entity265 and @entity266 , and concerts given by @entity268 and the @entity269			0
‘ they ’ve still got it ! ’ we cry , willing ourselves to believe it			0
but the truth is the new music of these rock dinosaurs is n’t a patch on the life - changing sounds that re-mapped popular culture the first time around			0
how could it be ? famous fan : comedian @entity283 joked around about @entity2 's return catch up : actor @entity285 did n't hear the news until tuesday afternoon fan : tv presenter @entity205 is clearly a fan of the veteran pop star model behaviour : @entity2 married second wife , supermodel @entity290 , in 1992 when @entity89 strutted on to @entity292 in 1972 , pouting into the camera and slinging an arm around his lead guitarist like they were lovers , the country was torn in two – one generation was disgusted , another inspired			1
@entity2 ’s sexuality was so incendiary that the video for @entity301 , a sustained shot ( innocuous by today ’s standard ’s ) panning across his heavily made - up face , was banned by the @entity305 that same year			1
the extreme , sexualised androgyny of @entity2 ’s make - up was deemed too shocking for television			1
what is the most extreme reaction that his latest release could provoke ? mild interest , melancholy for lost youth , nostalgia for the faded thrill of old songs			2
first wife : @entity2 married @entity318 in march 1970 , pictured in 1974 with their son @entity319 , before divorcing 10 years later in 1980 ' a wonderful father ' : @entity2 and his son , film director @entity319 it would have been far better if he ’d done something else – anything , apart from revisiting the @entity41			1
a novel , a collection of poems , a movie role , a website , just something that did n’t sully his musical legacy			2
this new song seems a sad admission that his imagination has finally run out			0
could beatle @entity335 ever have matched his greatest work – imagine , or help ! , or @entity337 – had he lived ? by 1980 he was already making the most lacklustre music of his life , with songs like @entity341			0
sir @entity342 meanwhile , has tried endlessly to recreate the glory of earlier days , without ever coming close			0
the same goes for all the ageing giants			0
glory days : @entity2 , seen performing as @entity89 in the 1970s , shocked fans with the release of a new single ahead of his first album in a decade still the old acts drag on			1
hoary warhorses like @entity266 and @entity268 continue their overpriced , never - ending tours playing old songs in new ways that no one much likes , or making hearts sink with that ghastly phrase : ‘ here ’s one from our new album ... ’ but no one ever sings the new songs in the shower , and no cover band plays them in the pub on a friday night			2
revolutions happen once in a lifetime			0
that ’s why there wo n’t be another @entity2			1
he changed the world … but that was long ago and far away			0
