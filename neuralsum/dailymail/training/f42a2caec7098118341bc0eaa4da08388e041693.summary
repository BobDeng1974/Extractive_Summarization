killed : @entity0 was shot in the head after knocking on a door in a white suburb of @entity4 as she , according to family , searched for help following a car accident a 19 - year - old @entity4 woman was reportedly shot dead in the back of the head while family members say she was searching for help early saturday in a white neighborhood outside the city			1
@entity0 was driving through @entity15 , @entity16 around 2:30am when she was in a car accident			1
at some point after knocking on the door of an area home , she was killed by the homeowner			2
now her family is demanding the man responsible must pay , but police seem to belive he killed her in self defense because he thought she was a criminal			1
police first said @entity0 ’s body had been dumped in the comparatively wealthy suburb because of its proximity to the city			1
that story has changed , however , and now authorities say she was killed near where she was found			0
and they ’ve identified the man who shot her , though it still unclear whether he was even the one who alerted authorities			2
police wo n’t release his name or say whether he ’s in or out of jail			0
a neighbor who spoke to police on the scene said they believed it was a self defense case			1
‘ he say , somebody tried to get in his house , or seems like force , ’ the neighbor told @entity51			0
‘ he got scared and shot the person			0
’ but @entity0 ’s family says that can not be true , that @entity0 would never hurt anyone and simply needed help in a neighborhood that was strange to her			1
and that does n’t explain why she was shot in the back of the head			1
suffering : @entity0 's family , including her aunt @entity64 , say she would never hurt anyone and was shot out of racism , though police reportedly told someone at the scene it was a self - defense case angry : ' you wanted her dead , ' said @entity75 of her cousin @entity0 's killer			1
' for somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice about it ? he should n't be free at all ' ‘ he did not have to pull that gun out and he did not have to kill my niece , ’ said @entity0 ’s aunt @entity64			1
‘ especially if she was leaving off the porch			0
’ @entity0 's cousin agreed			1
‘ you wanted her dead , ’ said @entity75 of her cousin @entity0 ’s killer			2
‘ for somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice about it ? he should n’t be free at all			0
’ @entity64 said the man should have called 911 instead of just pulling out a firearm			0
‘ the police would have been pulling up in 2 or 3 minutes in @entity15 , ’ she said			0
@entity64 believes her niece died because of racism and wonders what would have happened had she been the one who shot a stranger : ‘ would i be standing here ? no. i ’d be in jail without a bond			2
’ scene : police have n't named the shooter , but local reports put the scene of the incident -- and of @entity0 's final breaths -- on this @entity15 , @entity16 suburban front porch police have thus far released very little information on the case , which tragically parallels a case from just a few weeks back			1
that ’s when 24 - year - old @entity114 crashed his car in @entity116 on september 14			0
as he searched for help in a suburban neighborhood , he knocked on a door			0
the homeowner called 911 thinking that @entity114 , who was black , was trying to break into her home			0
when police arrived and @entity114 approached them , he was tasered			0
when he continued to approach them , @entity124 police officer @entity123 opened fire and shot him 10 times .			2

@entity0 was in a *middle* class white neighborhood outside @entity4 when she was shot in the back of the head on a area man 's porch around 2:30am saturday
police say the homeowner believed he was shooting in self defense , according to a neighbor
her outraged family says @entity0 would n't hurt a soul and her death was a *cowardly* act of racism
