@entity23 said on the messaging site : ‘ with age , every former s. tries to lecture everyone on morality			0
’ while he did n’t use the entire word , the meaning was clear to all as the @entity4 word for ‘ slut ’ or ‘ whore ’			2
at her @entity40 concert earlier in the week , @entity1 scrawled the words ‘ @entity34 ’ on her back and sang ‘ @entity56 ’ wearing the punk group ’s balaclava			2
