@entity0 has launched a campaign to stamp out the wrestling , grappling and shirt pulling in the penalty area that 's ruining our game			1
here 's what they 're all saying about it in the world of football : @entity12 and @entity13 both appear to grapple @entity14 and @entity15 of @entity16 @entity15 - @entity16 captain ‘ me and @entity14 were double headlocked at every corner			1
’ @entity20 - @entity19 assistant manager ‘ grappling			2
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ’ interpretation and we ’ll leave it to them			2
that ’s what the referees and the officials are paid for			2
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it ’s in their hands really			2
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n’t have to mark anyone			0
’ @entity43 , @entity44 striker ‘ there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			1
it was like @entity50 in the @entity52 area			1
’ @entity53 - former top referee ‘ hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			0
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			0
’ @entity61 - @entity62 defender ‘ defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			1
’ @entity61 developed a strategy for dealing with players like @entity72 when he encountered them with @entity74 @entity76 manager ‘ in a congested area how can you judge if someone ’s been blocked ? it ’s part of the game and some people are good at it			1
a local @entity96 referee came in and he was asking me about it			1
“ can you show me some blocking techniques ? ” that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			1
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n’t be given as penalties			2
there has to be consistency			0
’ @entity101 of @entity102 was rightly penalised for wrestling @entity104 striker @entity103 to the ground during last weekend 's match at the @entity107 and the readers of @entity109 ... ‘ it ’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it ’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
’ @entity117 , @entity118 ‘ to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i ’ve been watching football since the @entity128 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i ’ve ever seen			0
’ sir @entity131 , @entity133 @entity14 appeals for a penalty as he lies on the ground with @entity12 on top of him			0

it was like @entity50 in @entity52 area vs @entity16 , says @entity43
referees are trying to find ways of detecting grappling , says @entity144
one @entity96 official even asked @entity147 how to detect holds
refs ' allowing it to take place , ' *argues* @entity61
