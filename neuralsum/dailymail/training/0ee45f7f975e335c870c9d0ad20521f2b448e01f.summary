some 97 per cent of university admissions officers said they prized candidates capable of producing good written @entity5 above those who show a passion for their course or evidence they can think and work independently			1
nearly half said having a reasonable grasp of maths was a key factor in offering them a place			1
neither @entity5 nor maths featured when the survey was first carried out in 2007			1
the findings follow a dramatic slump in the standard of both subjects among undergraduates that has led to complaints by academics			2
six in ten academics are now providing remedial classes for first year students because they arrive so poorly prepared for the demands of higher education			0
most involve basic lessons in writing skills to improve spelling and grammar and teach essay structure			0
more than two - fifths of employers have also reported having to teach school - leavers and college graduates @entity5 , maths and it to bring them up to the standard required to function in the workplace			2
former @entity54 boss sir @entity53 described school standards as ' woeful ' in 2009 - the same year that sir @entity56 , then chief of @entity57 , said many school leavers were not ' fit for work '			0
spending on education doubled from £ 35.8 billion to £ 71 billion between 2000 and 2011 , during which @entity61 plummeted down world rankings according to the respected @entity64			0
the @entity61 slipped from 8th to 28th in maths , seventh to 25th in reading and fourth to 16th in science , leaving it behind relatively poor nations like @entity69 and @entity70			2
below par : both former @entity54 chief sir @entity53 , left , and @entity74 boss sir @entity56 , right , criticised school standards in 2009 education secretary @entity76 is introducing a new @entity77 with tougher exams in an attempt to drive up standards after years of grade inflation caused by exam boards offering increasingly easy qualifications that flattered schools ' achievements			0
the survey of university admissions officers found 88 per cent looked for students who show a passion for their chosen course , 83 per cent liked to see a positive attitude towards study and 72 per cent valued an ability to work independently			1
just 35 per cent were concerned about evidence of overcoming a difficult background - suggesting a resistance to social engineering which has seen universities being told to accept more disadvantaged students			0
less than a third expressed a particular interest in teenagers who had held positions of responsibility or undertaken work experience			0
excellence in sport or involvement in community or voluntary services did not make the top ten of desirable attributes			0
new measures : education secretary @entity76 is introducing a new @entity77 with tougher exams in an attempt to drive up standards after years of grade inflation @entity118 of @entity119 , which spoke to 80 admissions officers in the @entity61 and 20 in the @entity121 for the study , said : ' students spend an age crafting their personal statements , so it 's useful to see exactly which attributes really hit the mark with admissions teams			1
' much seems to boil down to an ability to communicate their passion and a drive to work hard , though it 's interesting to see the very strong emphasis placed on good written @entity5 , suggesting perhaps this is not always a given			1
' two thirds of admissions officers also said the @entity139 was best for preparing people for university , compared to 25 per cent for a-levels - indicating the gold standard exam has lost its lustre			1
meanwhile , another survey found children are familiar with it jargon that is ' completely alien ' to most adults			2
nine in ten children aged seven to 14 knew html stands for ' @entity152 ' and three - quarters correctly said @entity153 stands for ' @entity153 ' , according to research by exam revision service @entity155			0
yet half could n't say who invaded @entity159 in 1066 and 44 per cent did n't know which century the @entity160 took place in .			2

a survey of admissions officers found they prize good written @entity5
they prefer candidates with the ability to spell than those with *enthusiasm*
nearly half said a good grasp of maths was also a key entry requirement
