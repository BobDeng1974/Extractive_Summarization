by @entity1 reporter junk food companies are getting around a ban on children ’s tv advertising by interacting with them on @entity7 , an investigation has revealed			1
@entity9 ’s dispatches found manufacturers of sweets and sugary breakfast cereals were talking to children on social media			1
undercover reporters posing as an 11 - year - old were wished ‘ happy birthday ’ by the sweet brands @entity18 and @entity19 , which then went on to promote their products			2
the companies are exploiting a loophole in the law which bans advertising unhealthy food to children on the television – but not on the internet			1
marketing : this is a screen grab from an ' advergame ' created by @entity32 and apparently aimed at children academic research has shown that young children are especially vulnerable to it as they do not have the critical faculty to recognise they are being advertised to			1
some brands , including @entity39 , @entity40 's and @entity32 , are also advertising their wares via games available for children as young as four which are free to download online			1
experts said the disturbing new trend would contribute to the country ’s obesity crisis and called for the government to step in			2
dr @entity49 , a specialist in diabetes at @entity51 , said : ‘ if your product happens to be not particularly good for you and you ’re pushing it and it ’s got a child friendly message , then surely you ’re trying to encourage children to eat poor food			1
‘ the state needs to have some control over this			2
it will bankrupt the country eventually , as we wo n’t be able to afford all the health consequences			0
’ @entity64 , social marketing professor at the @entity65 , added : ‘ this is about subterfuge to get into the kids ’ lives to get into the family life and thereby access to the parent ’s pockets			1
‘ you ’ve got a product that might sell , all they ’re concerned with is selling it			0
’ promotion : the game features a @entity78 's restaurant despite the ban on advertising junk food to children advertising unhealthy food during children ’s television programmes was banned by @entity85 in 2007 in a bid to curb childhood obesity			1
the measure followed @entity90 research which found a direct link between overweight children and the impact of tv advertising			1
however , the ban does not cover the internet , meaning many brands have simply switched to targeting youngsters while they play on their computer , tablet or smartphone			0
@entity7 rules stipulate that you must be at least 13 years old to have a profile , but many children lie about their age			2
the @entity108 undercover team created a profile using the birthday of a 16 year - old , but posted messages online saying they were 11 years old			2
they identified six brands which they found to be interacting with children on @entity7 , and posted messages on their walls about an up - coming 11th birthday			2
some of the brands responded by commenting on the post			0
chewits wrote back : ‘ happy birthday for saturday ! well , we now have chewmix bags which have a random mix of core and @entity126 in them and later this month we will be announcing a very exciting new product so keep your eyes peeled			0
@entity130 ! ’ @entity19 sent a smiley face and promoted its ' @entity133 ' gum sweets by writing : ' did you manage to get those squashies for your party ? ' brands including @entity18 wished children ' happy birthday ' on social media sites , before pushing their products @entity143 's @entity142 , a sugary cereal laced with chocolate , also indicated that they ‘ liked ’ one of the child ’s messages posted on @entity7			1
many brands are now also producing ‘ advergames ’ for children which they can download onto their computer or smartphone from an online @entity156			1
programme researchers found games by @entity32 , @entity39 and @entity40 's that were made available with a 4 + age on the parental control rating			0
all three of these brands have previously pledged not to advertise sugary and fattening products to anyone under the age of 12			0
in one example highlighted by the programme , @entity32 has produced a game in collaboration with @entity78 's called crabs and @entity171			0
it features a @entity78 's restaurant as part of the scenery , and the game involves getting a crab to collect cola bottle tops			0
chewits also has a game featuring a @entity180 , while @entity181 also have one themed around their sweets , @entity183			0
dr @entity184 , marketing expert at @entity185 , told the programme : ‘ the way that companies market to children online is really very sneaky			1
advertising really is most effective when people do n’t think of it as advertising , when they ’re thinking of the game they ’re playing			2
' @entity195 of the @entity196 added : ‘ it ’s absolutely the case that advergames are less easily identifiable as an advert than something that interrupts the programme you ’ve just been watching for the last half an hour			0
the fundamental point is , is it appropriate ? ’ when approached for comment , all the companies mentioned said they do not target children with advertising			1
a @entity143 ’s spokesman said : ‘ as soon as we noticed the age we unliked it , reported the post to @entity7 , and sent a note to the girl and her parents			0
‘ the post mentions that it was her eleventh birthday and we accept that this is something that should have been identified earlier			0
’ @entity32 , @entity39 and @entity40 ’s all said their games were aimed at over 12s , with the latter two saying the 4 + rating had been imposed by the @entity156			0
as a result of the investigation , both @entity143 ’s and @entity18 have said they will review their social media policies .			1
