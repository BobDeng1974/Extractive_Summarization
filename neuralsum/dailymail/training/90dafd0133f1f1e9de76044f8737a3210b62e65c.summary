by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:29 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 24 april 2013 @entity2 is considering a temporary withdrawal from the @entity5 human rights convention in order to finally remove @entity7 from @entity8			1
the prime minister held a ‘ council of war ’ with senior ministers yesterday to find a way of deporting the hate preacher to his native @entity13 to face terror charges , according to sources			0
home secretary @entity17 , justice secretary @entity18 and attorney general @entity19 were summoned for talks at @entity21 shortly before the government discovered it had lost the latest round in an interminable legal battle to remove the terror suspect			0
@entity2 is considering a temporary withdrawal from the @entity5 human rights convention in order to finally remove @entity7 from @entity8 remaining in @entity8 ? @entity7 has won the latest court case today in his long running legal battle to avoid deportation sources said mr @entity2 had declared @entity34 ’s continued presence in @entity8 ‘ intolerable ’ and insisted even the most controversial options must be considered			1
it is understood that one possibility is @entity8 temporarily leaving the @entity38 – a move which would infuriate the @entity40 and push the @entity41 to breaking point			2
appeal : @entity17 had hoped to take the case against @entity34 to the @entity45 today the prime minister 's officials spokesman refused to rule out the option of temproairily withdrawing from the @entity38			1
he told journalsists : ' the government will explore every option in seeking to deport this dangerous individual and that 's what we are going to keep doing			2
' the prime minister met with the home secretary , the justice secretary and the attorney general yesterday to discuss the case , i 'm not going to get into specifics as to what the government is considering , as i say , we are going to explore every option			0
' @entity5 judges have ruled that @entity34 would not receive a fair trial in @entity13 but conservative mps have suggested that the threat of @entity8 pulling out of the convention would persuade @entity69 to back down			1
the prime minister ’s decision to put himself at the head of @entity51 efforts to remove @entity34 is high risk , since he will now be blamed if they fail			1
mrs may is expected to announce new developments in negotiations with @entity13 over his deportation when she makes an emergency statement to the @entity81 today			0
ministers have been trying for a decade to send @entity34 to @entity13 , where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the millennium			2
his removal was originally approved by the @entity8 courts , only to be halted by the @entity89 last year			2
judges in @entity69 said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			0
controversially , mrs may opted not to appeal against this verdict			0
instead , she and her ministers secured personal promises from the @entity13 authorities there would be no use of torture evidence , and began the deportation process again in the @entity8 legal system			1
but last november , the @entity105 said it was not satisfied with the assurances , and halted @entity34 ’s removal			2
the court said it must reflect the @entity69 ruling			0
that decision was last month upheld by the @entity112 and yesterday the same court refused permission for the home secretary to challenge the ruling in the @entity45			1
the government is to persist with its bid by applying directly to the @entity45 for permission			2
a @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ the government remains committed to deporting this dangerous man and we continue to work with the @entity13 to address the outstanding legal issues preventing deportation			1
’ still smiling : labour and conservative ministers have been trying to deport @entity34 for a decade but have failed in her statement to @entity126 today , mrs may will announce new developments in negotiations with @entity13 over deporting @entity34			2
@entity119 minister @entity129 is understood to have visited the country to secure fresh assurances that the preacher will be treated fairly			0
however , any new agreement would undoubtedly be subject to fresh appeals by @entity34			0
at best , it would restart the legal @entity136 , with the case going back through the @entity8 courts – and even returning to the @entity89 in @entity69			0
that could allow @entity34 to remain in @entity8 for many years at taxpayers ’ expense			1
@entity34 – who has been linked to a long list of international terrorists – is currently in @entity146 high - security jail for allegedly breaching his immigration bail conditions			0
it is feared the longer the case drags on the less willing judges will be to insist @entity34 remains in prison and the more likely it is that he will be allowed back out on to the streets			0
@entity154 and @entity155 mp @entity155 , a former human rights lawyer , said : ‘ the last government made a major mistake in not deporting @entity34 in 2009 , when the @entity8 @entity158 gave the green light			1
‘ @entity34 has been running rings around the @entity8 justice system ever since			1
this case shows we urgently need to overhaul the law on deportation , scrap the @entity166 and start standing up for @entity8 democracy rather than kow - towing to the @entity89 in @entity69			2
’ shadow home secretary @entity168 said after today ’s decision was announced : ‘ a year ago , @entity17 promised @entity7 would soon be on a plane			0
‘ now it is clear her legal strategy has completely failed			0
the home secretary must tell us urgently what she is going to do now to get @entity7 deported or tried , and keep him off our streets			0
