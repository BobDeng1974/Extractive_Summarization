these fascinating creatures spend their lives diving inside the mouths of fish to remove the parasites that lurk there			0
@entity11 imitated the behaviour of the surrounding fish swarm to entice the cleaner shrimp into his mouth whilst snorkelling with his father @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the shrimp then incredibly started to clean @entity11 's mouth and remove food from between the boys teeth whilst @entity16 took photographs			1
@entity11 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ‘ it felt like tiny little dentists picking away at my teeth and scuttling around my mouth , it tickled a little but not too badly			2
‘ i had watched fish getting cleaned at cleaning stations before and decided to try it out myself			0
‘ i thought it would be really cool to experience shrimp in my mouth first hand			2
fishy business : these fascinating creatures spend their lives diving inside the mouths of their underwater neighbours to remove the parasites that lurk there open wide : @entity11 , who has been diving with his father for seven years , is unfazed by the dangers of holding his mouth open underwater ‘ it is a large part of the ecosystem underwater and many fish rely on the shrimp so i decided to rely on them as well			1
’ father and son discovered the fish ' cleaning station ' where the shrimp wait for customers , in a beautiful outcrop of sponges growing from some rocks			0
the area was loaded with cleaner shrimp and surrounded by hoards of fish			1
hard to spot : capturing the cleaner shrimp doing their good work on a human mouth is rare quick - witted : the shrimp dart out of the mouth as soon as it begins to close @entity11 who has been diving with his father for seven years is unfazed by the dangers of holding his mouth open underwater			1
he learnt how to get the shrimp out of his mouth when he needs to breathe , by imitating the behaviour of the fish			2
@entity11 said : ‘ i observed that the shrimp are always keeping an eye on the mouth of the fish and as soon as it starts to close they shoot out			1
big - scale operation : father and son discovered the fish ' cleaning station ' where the shrimp wait for customers , in a beautiful outcrop of sponges growing from some rocks popular : lots of fish have come to rely on the services of the cleaner shrimps lunch is served : a cleaner shrimp inspects the gaping mouth of a large fish as it looks for parasites to eat ‘ i do the same thing as the fish , when i start to run out of air i slowly close my mouth and the shrimp get out of there			1
’ the behaviour of species like the @entity120 - banded @entity119 is well known to hard - core biologists and divers but capturing the process on a human is very rare			0
@entity16 said : ‘ it really is pretty amazing that these little shrimp immediately recognize a human mouth as analogous to a fish mouth and go in looking for bits of food			2
‘ it takes a relaxed diver to take out his regulator at 23 metres deep and present your mouth wide open to some shrimp			0
‘ you have to hold your breath for i 'd say at least 30 seconds to have a reasonable chance , and @entity11 calmly held his breath for over 40 seconds			0
‘ it is pretty unusual for a kid of @entity11 's age to be able to do it			0
