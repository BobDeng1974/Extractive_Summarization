this is n't right ! @entity4 turns the pages of his road map as he tries to work out which way to go next maybe if you turn it upside down ... @entity4 continues to stare at the map , oblivious to the police filming him @entity55 , safety camera team manager for @entity38 police , said @entity4 should consider himself lucky			1
' mr @entity4 captured the attention of the safety camera operator when he began to wander across the dotted white line of the overtaking lane as he read the map , ' said mr @entity55			0
' the footage captured by the safety camera shows the driver is distracted for a least 10 seconds while flicking through his atlas and then holding it up to his face , completely obscuring his view of the road			0
' those 10 seconds could have been disastrous for him or other road users - he should consider himself fortunate that he was in a position to attend court and escape with just a driving ban and hefty fine			0
' this case demonstrates the clear evidence captured by the safety camera and should serve as a reminder to other road users of the potential consequences if they choose to take dangerous and unnecessary risks			0
