@entity1 coach @entity0 has blamed @entity3 's lack of game - time at @entity5 for an @entity6 qualifying defeat to @entity8			1
@entity3 was unable to inspire the @entity9 to victory against @entity8 as they went down 2 - 0 courtesy of goals from @entity14 's @entity13 and new @entity15 signing @entity16			1
and @entity0 said @entity3 - who is yet to play for @entity5 this season - was not fit enough to perform at the level required , with his team - mates also struggling due to the @entity20 league being yet to start			2
struggle : @entity3 could n't inspire @entity1 and that led their coach to speak about his fitness issues @entity27 0 - 3 @entity26 guinea 2 - 1 @entity28 @entity8 2 - 0 @entity1 @entity3 initially impressed at @entity29 following an £ 11million move from @entity31 in january but has fallen down the pecking order under @entity33 this season with @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 preferred in the wide positions			1

the @entity20 league has n't started yet and also @entity3 did n’t play regularly with @entity5			0
if @entity3 is off - form , @entity1 's performance is always affected			0
' @entity3 will now return to @entity5 for training on wednesday after the international break but is expected to be excluded from the starting line - up again for their game against @entity67 on saturday			0
