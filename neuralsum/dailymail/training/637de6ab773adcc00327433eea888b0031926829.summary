@entity0 again gave a hint that there was more to come from the @entity3 forward , despite being starved of service in the last - 16 tie against @entity6			1
@entity3 may have had just one shot on target all game , but the man who will line up at the @entity12 next season was part of everything good they produced and was a handful for an experienced @entity6 backline			2
the 22 - year - old is an awkward player to get to grips with			0
the @entity20 , usually so defensively sound , found him a nuisance and for long periods they could n't get near him as he provided a useful outlet for @entity25 counter-attacks			2
20 minutes : @entity0 darts towards the box , cutting in from the right , but is brought down just outside the box			2
34 minutes : tricks his way past a defender but his moves were too clever leading to him losing control and the ball			0
70 minutes : @entity0 perfectly shows his qualities as a counter-attacking outlet , brilliantly bringing down a long ball and leaving the @entity20 defender to chase him 103 minutes : the 22 - year - old 's impressive workrate seems to have tired him out and he showed signs of struggling to offer quite as much for his side			1
111 minutes : @entity0 tries to flick the ball in as a low cross comes to him but he misses and it passes through his legs			0
120 minutes : with his legs tiring @entity0 loses the ball on a counter-attack and @entity6 almost score the winner at the other end			0
penalty shoot - out : slots his penalty into the bottom left - hand corner , sending @entity80 - @entity79 the wrong way			0
that half of @entity6 's back four played their club football with @entity86 last season makes his display even more impressive			0
these are defenders that should be used to what @entity0 does after training with him for a year - but he so often eluded them it looked like they had never heard of him			2
@entity0 is not the answer to @entity94 's striking problems - and labelling him as such would be nothing but problematic			1
the @entity96 still need to sign someone to lead the line but @entity0 does provide another option that @entity94 ca n't currently boast			1
against @entity6 he was a perfect outlet as @entity3 stood strong in defence , leaving @entity0 to stretch the @entity20 backline , find pockets of space and use his excellent first touch to relieve pressure			1
he came close to winning a first half penalty after being brought down just outside the area and constantly made himself available			0
in total , he drew four fouls as the @entity20 defenders struggled to deal with his ability to find fight spaces before using his low centre of gravity and soft touch to bring the ball under control and keep hold of it			1
sadly he could n't top the performance with a winning goal : missing his best chance as he allowed the ball to go between his legs as he attempted to flick it goalwards in extra time - although he did confidently convert his penalty			0
the fear for @entity94 fans will be whether he can perform for a big side			0
@entity3 have n't been favourites in any of their four @entity133 games - in the @entity134 will be expected to help break down underdogs			0
roll with the punches : @entity0 looked tired towards the end which may have been due to the fouling tough to mark : @entity0 was a constantly nuisance for the @entity20 defenders that can be difficult for any forward : even @entity141 , who has been so impressive at @entity142 and @entity143 , has struggled to match those exploits in a @entity146 shirt in @entity147			1
his characteristics and tricky play gives @entity150 's attacking bow another string and while he may not be the answer to @entity94 's big question , he could pose his own questions of @entity134 defenders			1
eyes on the prize : @entity0 looks determined to get the ball in this aerial challenge leading the way : @entity0 manages to escape the attentions of @entity162 working up a sweat : @entity0 found himself tired towards the end after a tough shift			1

@entity3 used @entity0 to spark their counter-attacking play
things will be different at @entity94 but he still provides more options
the usually solid @entity20 defenders found him awkward to mark
but he tired as the game went on and his workrate suffered
@entity0 converted his penalty as @entity3 went through
