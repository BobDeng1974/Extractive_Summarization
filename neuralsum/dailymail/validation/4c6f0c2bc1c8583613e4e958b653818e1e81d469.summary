scores of protesters gathered around the courthouse in support of a mother after a judge issued an arrest order on tuesday for her after she fled with her son to prevent his circumcision and ignored a demand to appear in court			1
circuit judge @entity11 signed the order in a seven - minute hearing , three days after finding @entity14 in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment unless she reported to court with the child			1
her attorney , @entity18 , said his client is staying with her 4 - year - old son in a shelter for domestic violence victims because the boy was ' scared to death ' of undergoing the surgery			1
@entity26 of @entity27 , right , sits in court on tuesday , with his lawyers may @entity30 and @entity31 , in a continuing legal battle with @entity14 , the mother of his four - year - old son over circumcision warrant for arrest : circuit judge @entity11 signed the order in a seven - minute hearing , three days after finding @entity14 in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment @entity14 and the boy 's father , @entity26 , were never married but share custody of their child			1
' i was hoping the mother was going to be here , ' @entity26 ' attorney may @entity30 said on tuesday			2
' i was , too , ' @entity11 replied			2
the @entity51 reports that the the judge last week called it ' reprehensible ' for the mom to have kept the boy 's location hidden from the father since february 20			1
' i will allow her to avoid incarceration or get out of jail if she signs the consent to the procedure , ' @entity11 said friday			2
in a parenting agreement filed in court , the two agreed to the boy 's circumcision , but the mother later changed her mind , leading to a long court battle			1
the father said he decided to pursue the circumcision in december 2013 when the boy was 3 , after noticing his son was urinating on his leg , reports @entity51			1
the father on friday said the boy 's pediatrician had diagnosed a condition called phimosis , which prevents retraction of the foreskin and that can be cured with circumcision			1
@entity85 and appellate judges have sided with the father , but potential surgeons have backed out after refusing to get the mother 's consent or becoming the target of anti-circumcision protesters who side with her			2
supporters of @entity96 gather out side of the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 where the mother was to face off in court with the father of her child , @entity26 ' she did this for one reason and one reason only : because the child is scared to death of this procedure , ' @entity18 told @entity11 , launching into a defense that was cut off by the judge			1
' so mr. @entity18 , i take it then that the mother is not going to appear today ? ' the judge said			0

' ok , that 's all i needed to know , ' @entity11 said			2
' your honor , if i may , ' the lawyer pleaded			0
' no , you may not , ' the judge shot back			0
although circumcision rates have fallen in the @entity127 , a majority of boys still undergo the procedure to remove their foreskin			0
meantime , a movement opposing circumcision has developed , and the case has become a rallying cry for so - called ' intactivists ' who deride the surgery as barbaric			0
a small group of those anti-circumcision advocates gathered outside the court to demonstrate in support of @entity141 , and expressed outrage over the judge 's order			0
' it 's just ridiculous , ' said one of the protesters , @entity146 of @entity148			0
