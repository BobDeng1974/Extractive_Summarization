former @entity1 hardman @entity0 has picked his # one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career , on the @entity5 on @entity6			1
@entity0 , whose played for a number of @entity9 clubs , picked a mixture of talent in his squad - with players from @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity1 making the cut			1
watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the @entity5 , @entity6 1 or catch up on demand			1
@entity0 ( centre ) picks his best 11 he played with and included @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 goalkeeper : @entity23 has to be ' @entity24			1
' what a fantastic goalkeeper , i played with @entity27 and he was a very good goalkeeper but for me @entity23 was another level			1
just the fact that , one on one 's , normally when somebody goes through on the goalkeeper you just pray that they 're going to save it but you just knew @entity23 was going to save it , so we 'd always set up a counter-attack because we knew he would			1
he could also throw the ball as far as he could kick it and the amount of times we would get get corners against us , he 'd pluck it and release it to @entity43 and @entity44 and we 'd score goals			1
best goalkeeper in the world during his time			1
right back : @entity50 he is a great player			1
@entity51 joined @entity15 the same time as me and he was just awesome			1
he was just a young kid but he just slotted into the way we played			1
the reason i put him in ahead of @entity57 is because @entity58 can play in different positions and i always want players who can be flexible and what ever position he played in - he was world class			1
men - of - men			2
in our @entity1 team we were all men , we were all big characters and big men but he was men - of - men			1
he was a leader and he inspired people around him			2
people say he was n't the best passer but he was n't that bad			2
his volley against @entity77 showed he could play			2
he was n't the quickest but his timing of tackling			2
he was a brilliant organiser , he 's top draw			2
@entity23 was labelled as the best goalkeeper in the world by former team - mate @entity0 @entity83 ( right ) played with @entity0 at @entity16 and was picked in his @entity5 squad @entity64 : @entity83 very unlucky to not play for @entity1 more			1
laziest man you 'll ever meet in football , if you did running he 'd be at the back , when you finished training he 'd be the first out of the door			2
i used to go round his house and he 'd be playing on his @entity95 eating @entity94			2
but when it came to playing football you would never see anyone go past him , you 'd never see anyone beat him and he had telescopic legs , he was quick and he could play			2
the only negative is that he should have scored more goals but what a player			2
left back : @entity107 when i first met him at @entity15 , i thought wow			1
firstly , i could n't believe how big his legs were , you can see that in the way he plays and strikes a ball			0
he had great pace up and down the line , he could tackle , score and he was an incredible player			0
the only thing that disappointed me was that @entity118 let him go to @entity119 a little bit early			0
right wing : @entity20 an easy decision			1
@entity20 was the true professional , he was probably the best technical player i played with			1
i used to watch him and watch him			0
as soon as we 'd finished [ training ] , the mannequins would be out and he 'd be taking free - kicks , corners and he 'd do it for an hour			0
every training session he 'd give 110 per cent , he would never beat anybody but if you give him a yard , he 'll put in the best balls you 'll ever see			0
@entity0 described @entity20 as the best technical player he played with during his footballing career @entity139 : @entity140 for a complete player , without a doubt @entity143			1
apart from the bad side he had , he was the complete midfield player for me			0
he was an inspiration , a leader , could score you vital goals , he could tackle when he had too , he would be naughty when he had too but playing alongside him for three or four seasons helped him improve my game a lot			0
@entity139 : @entity21 probably the best player i played with			0
what more can i say ? he 's a maverick , he just had everything			0
he was n't the quickest but he had that little injection of pace to get away from people and i remember seeing @entity162 play for the first time at @entity164 and he was telling @entity165 to keep up			0
he 's brilliant , scores all types of goals and without doubt the best player i played alongside			0
@entity21 was highly praised by @entity0 and claims the former @entity172 man was the best he played with left wing : @entity43 he would play 20 games and be unplayable , he was that good			1
if you 're a full back and think get tight - then he 'll spin inside , he you drop off then he will rip you apart			0
outstanding player , what he 's done in the game , his mindset when he played in centre midfielder for @entity16 for two or three years says it all			0
the best left winger there will ever be			0
striker : @entity185 could n't leave him out			0
when @entity185 did come to @entity16 i knew that we 'd win the title because he just had the aura and presence about him			0
he took the responsibility away from all of us lot			0
he was unbelievable , he 'd come in at half past nine every morning , do his own warm - up and work on his skills , touch and his x , y and z. he was just brilliant			0
his goals and importance to the team make him an unbelievable player			0
striker : @entity202 when i think about a complete striker and what i 'd want as a manager as my striker is @entity202			1
it 's not just the goals he scored , he was a handful , he could run the channels , his retention of the ball was fantastic and he was a leader of men			0
i do n't think we 'll have a striker in that mould again			0
@entity185 ( left ) and @entity202 are two of the best strikers the @entity220 has seen @entity0 shows how his @entity221 ( with nicknames ) would line up on the pitch			1

@entity0 named his # one2eleven xi on the @entity5 on @entity6
there was a mix of players from @entity230 , the @entity220 and @entity1
@entity107 , @entity20 and @entity202 feature , but who else ?
