by @entity0 crashing waves from storm swells may melt @entity4 sea ice far faster than previously believed			1
researchers have found that large ocean waves can flow through ice packs for hundreds of miles before their force is weakened			1
experiments in @entity10 by a @entity12 - led team revealed these wave movements are strong enough to break up the ice and trigger melting			0
pictured , a buoy to measure waves in @entity21 is lowered on to sea ice scientists positioned sensors at difference distances from the edge of ice packs and recorded what happened when strong waves roared over the surface			1
for smaller waves , less than 9.8 feet ( 3 metres ) in height , the up and down movement caused by the waves quickly weakened			1
but for larger waves , the movement through the ice went on for up to 217 miles ( 350km )			1
hydrodynamics scientist , dr @entity39 , of the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) in @entity12 , said increasing storminess in the @entity21 could accelerate sea ice retreat in the future			1

on the left , dr @entity39 with two of her wave sensors on the stern of the @entity50 during the @entity51 ( @entity46 ) voyage scientists positioned sensors at difference distances from the edge of ice packs and recorded what happened when strong waves roared over the surface ‘ waves propagating through the @entity62 leave behind a wake of broken ice floes , which are then more easily broken up and deformed by winds and currents , ’ she said			0
‘ this mixing and churning eliminates the sea ice barrier between the air and the ocean and increases heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean			2
’ the miz is a region of broken ice floes , hundreds of kilometres wide , that forms at the boundary of the open ocean and the pack ice			0
predicting the scale of ice breakup requires an understanding of how far waves move into it			0
‘ we found that the retreat and expansion of the sea ice edge correlated with significant wave height increases and decreases respectively , ’ she said			1

dr @entity39 said that since the days of @entity4 explorer @entity96 , it has been known that waves play a role in breaking - up sea ice , but this role has not been well understood ‘ a two metre increase in significant wave height over a decade led to a two degree latitudinal retreat in ice extent			1
’ dr @entity39 found that the largest increases in wave height occurred in the @entity107 , where regional sea ice retreat is well documented			1
similarly , the largest wave height decreases were in the @entity110 , where sea ice has expanded			2
dr @entity39 said that since the days of @entity4 explorer @entity96 , it has been known that waves play a role in breaking - up sea ice , but this role has not been well understood			2
‘ our results suggest that sea ice is vulnerable to changes in storminess			2
the southward shift in storm tracks over recent decades has resulted in fewer cyclones at mid latitudes and more cyclones at higher latitudes , ’ dr @entity39 said			0
‘ in the future , wave heights are predicted to increase everywhere at the sea - ice edge in the @entity131 and @entity10			2
so it is conceivable that this will accelerate sea - ice retreat			1
’ the @entity4 ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously believed			0
the study reveals that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise			2
during one period 14,600 years ago , melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft ( 2 metres ) in just 100 years			0
the results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in @entity4 's and reflect predictions for the region 's future			0
it also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the @entity4 ice sheet has already begun and could be ' unstoppable			0
' the study was conducted by an international team including researchers from @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
periods of rapid increase in iceberg - rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the @entity4 ice sheet			0
the researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago , and continuing until 9,000 years ago			0
up until now , melting of @entity4 ice sheet was n't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago .			0

this is particularly true of waves higher than 9.8ft ( 3 metres ) , study found
in large waves , movement in sea ice went on for up to 217 miles ( 350km )
storms in @entity21 could accelerate sea ice retreat in the future
