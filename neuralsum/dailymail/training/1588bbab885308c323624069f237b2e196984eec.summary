@entity2 's plan to impose a mansion tax is ' crude ' and would end up ' clobbering ' people , @entity0 warned last night			1
the @entity6 grandee launched a stinging attack of the party leader 's flagship policy claiming it was ' short - termist '			1
to add further insult , @entity0 , one of the architects of @entity6 , said he preferred the policy drawn up by the @entity13 to introduce extra council tax bands for high - value homes			1
but he is already facing civil war within his party over the policy , with strong criticism from many including potential @entity31 candidates @entity32 , dame @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
in an interview with @entity37 last night , @entity0 acknowledged : ' we do n't have an efficient way of taxing property in @entity41			2
' but he added : ' i do n't happen to think the mansion tax is the right policy response to that , i think it 's crude , i think it 's short - termist , what we need is what i think the @entity13 are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system , that 's what i would like to see , it will take longer to introduce , that 's true , but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short - term mansion tax			1
' full details have yet to be announced , but shadow chancellor @entity60 last year said homes worth between £ 2million and £ 3million will face an annual bill of £ 3,000 , regardless of income			2
critics warn the tax will disproportionately hit @entity66 and the @entity67 , where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans			0
@entity6 estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country			0
people earning less than £ 42,000 will be able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands in an effort to protect people , especially in the capital , who have seen the value of their house soar in recent years			2
@entity0 said : ' you do need a fair , progressive taxation system where people who are earning the most and accumulating the most wealth pay the most			2
' and for very many people they should n't pay anything at all , because they simply do n't have the incomes , or the wealth , or the assets , to support that			0
' the former business secretary said he was not worried about the message being sent out by the mansion tax , but he added : ' i want policy effectiveness , i want efficiency			1
' i think people are entitled to expect thought - through , sophisticated responses to serious problems			2
' he told @entity37 : ' we have to make sure that what we are doing is , in a sense , recreating the policies that we saw in the @entity108 era , where we saw a pro-business , liberal economic approach but combined with very strong policies and interventions by government in order to create opportunities for individuals and to redistribute income and wealth more fairly			0
' conservative party chairman @entity118 said : ‘ with @entity0 joining the chorus of @entity6 voices opposed to @entity6 's homes tax , it is clearer than ever that @entity2 is a weak leader peddling a bad policy			1
' it is yet more proof that he simply is n't up to the job of running the country			0
’ the @entity13 plan , backed by @entity0 , would involve a series of extra bands of taxation for properties worth more than £ 2million on top of council tax			1
earlier this month , @entity135 leader @entity134 caused outrage from within the party after he set out plans to use millions of pounds raised from the tax in @entity140 to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border			0
in november , @entity2 ( centre ) was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the mansion tax proposal by singer and classical musician @entity147 ( left ) in a heated television debate mps queued up to attack mr @entity134 after he boasted that would boost the @entity24 in @entity151 by using up to £ 250million raised from the tax in @entity140			1
just 0.3 per cent of the £ 1.2billion raised by the tax - around £ 3.6million - will come from @entity151 , but it will receive a huge share of the revenues			1
former @entity6 leadership @entity156 accused mr @entity134 of trying to ' buy @entity151 votes with money expropriated from @entity66 '			0
and former labour cabinet minister @entity160 warned him against treating the @entity67 as a ' cash cow '			0
in november , mr @entity2 was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by @entity147			1
the singer and classical musician tore strips out of his pledge during a television debate , telling him that it was ' disturbing '			0
' you may as well just tax me on this glass of water , ' she told him during the angry exchange			0
' you ca n't just point at things and tax them			0
' a year after @entity6 came to power in 1997 , @entity0 famously said : ' we are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes			1
' he bought an £ 8million house in @entity66 four years ago			0
a @entity184 spokeswoman said : ' the mansion tax will help fund a @entity186 to pay for 20,000 more nurses , 8,000 more gps , 5,000 more home care workers and 3,000 more midwives			1
' when working people have seen their wages fall by £ 1,600 a year since 2010 it is right to ask those who have the most to make a bigger contribution			2

@entity0 described mansion tax plan as ' crude ' and ' short - termist '
@entity200 @entity2 's proposal for the tax would end up ' clobbering ' people
also said he preferred @entity13 plan to introduce more council tax bands
mr @entity2 has said new mansion tax plan would raise £ 1.2billion a year
