almost 100 years since the @entity0 sparked the start of the @entity2 , a library in @entity4 has made it possible to explore just how far , wide and deep the fighting extended			2
more than 130 trench maps covering the major battlegrounds across @entity9 and @entity10 can now be examined , in unprecedented detail , online			1
they reveal the changing @entity13 and its communication trenches , the location of enemy positions and defences - and show how the landscape has fared since			1
select trench maps below to reveal how the @entity20 evolved between 1915 and 1918 a selection of the maps highlight artillery gun emplacements , machine guns , mines , wire entanglements , and observation posts , while others record the names that fighting soldiers gave the trenches			1
many show the names of nearby farms , villages , woods , and other landmarks , too			2

the earliest mapping is from 1915 for @entity39 , and @entity40			0
trench maps are a primary source for studying the major battlefields of the war			1
accurate locations , and the distances and bearings between them were essential for the artillery , and all the maps show the @entity50 as an overlay			2
although every country involved in the conflict had medium scale mapping for reconnaissance purposes , the emergence of trench warfare created the need for much more detailed maps			2
due to the difficulties using current maps of @entity9 and @entity10 , the decision was taken to resurvey much of the area behind the @entity64 from late 1914 onwards			2
trench maps are a primary source for studying the major battlefields of the war			1
these are often referred to in the written histories of the event , including personal war diaries and official regimental accounts			0
accurate locations , and the distances and bearings between them , were essential for the artillery - and all the maps show the @entity50 as an overlay			0
this is a ' unique referencing system ' often used in associated written records , said the @entity79 of @entity4 which digitised the maps			1
' comparing trench maps to each other over time , and to the current maps allow a graphic insight into the changing topography of the @entity20 , ' explained the library website			1
‘ maps have always been vital tools for military commanders , allowing them to form a picture of the terrain for planning attack and defence , but their value rose to greater prominence than ever during the @entity2			0
’ it is estimated more than over 34 million @entity98 maps of the @entity20 were printed between 1914 and 18 , the vast majority by @entity100			1
the maps on the library 's site can be explored by location , or by place name			0
using drop - down menus on the left - hand side			0
maps are laid onto @entity110 satellite imagery , but @entity100 , @entity110 and @entity111 can be selected using a drop - down menu in the top right - hand corner			0
each of the individual trench maps can be viewed on their own , from the trenches list			1
although every country involved in the conflict had medium scale mapping for reconnaissance purposes , the emergence of trench warfare created the need for much more detailed maps			0

it was one of the strongly fortified villages held by the @entity142 at the beginning of the @entity144			0
the village , about five miles north of @entity145 , marked the most northern point of the main attack on the 1 july 1916 other maps record the names that fighting soldiers gave the trenches ( pictured )			1
this image shows trenches around @entity155 and @entity156 in @entity157			0
the trenches were recorded on 2 december 1916			0
until early 1918 , @entity142 trenches were usually overprinted in red , with @entity98 or @entity162 trenches , where shown , in blue			1
after this point , the colours were reversed to match the @entity9 map system accurately plotting positions and the measurements between them became crucial for planning bombardment , and for firing on hidden targets based on their precise location			0
the earliest mapping in the @entity79 of @entity4 's archive is from 1915 for @entity39 ( pictured ) and @entity40 artillery was also vulnerable to long - range rifle and machine - gun fire , and maps allowed defensive positions to be set up			1
due to the difficulties using existing maps of @entity9 and @entity10 , the decision was taken to resurvey much of the area behind the @entity64 from late 1914 onwards			0
but , the survey work was dangerous , and aerial photography was used for enemy trench mapping , artillery maps , and other large - scale maps			1
@entity98 field survey and mapping on the @entity20 was officially coordinated by @entity190 , in collaboration with @entity192 at the @entity193 and colonel sir @entity194 at the @entity100			2
from october 1914 , large - scale maps were printed by the @entity100 at @entity197 , with the @entity193 concentrating on smaller - scale maps , but aspects of production moved to @entity9 and @entity10 during the @entity2			2
lithography allowed maps to be drawn straight onto the printing stone , or onto transfer paper from which it was laid down onto the stone , and sheets could be printed rapidly by hand			0
until early 1918 , @entity142 trenches were usually overprinted in red , with @entity98 or @entity162 trenches , where shown in blue , but after this point , the colours were reversed for the remainder of the @entity2 with @entity142 trenches shown in blue to match the @entity9 trench map colour system			1
the earliest mapping is from 1915 for @entity39 , and @entity40			0
in 1918 , the speed of the @entity142 @entity220 and advances from march to june resulted in the front lines moving more than 60 miles ( 96km ) west , while the @entity162 retaliation from the summer onwards drove the @entity142 rapidly back to the east , but trench maps were still compiled and were of value @entity227			1
although every country involved in the conflict had medium scale mapping for reconnaissance purposes , the emergence of trench warfare created the need for much more detailed maps			0
early maps were based on enlarged versions of existing @entity9 and @entity10 maps , such as war office map of @entity240 recorded in 1912 ( pictured left )			0
the right - hand trench map shows @entity98 lines in blue , and @entity142 in red east of @entity244 , revised to 4 march 1917 this map reveals the changing positions of the @entity142 ( red ) and @entity98 ( blue ) in the @entity248 from 1916 to 1918			1

the trench maps cover @entity260 between 1915 and 1918 and were digitised by the @entity79 of @entity4
they reveal the changing front line and its communication trenches , as well as the location of enemy positions
maps also highlight artillery gun emplacements , machine guns , mines , wire entanglements , and observation posts
a selection of the maps record the names that soldiers gave the trenches , as well as the names of nearby landmarks
it is estimated more than 34 million @entity98 maps of the @entity20 were printed between 1914 and 1918
