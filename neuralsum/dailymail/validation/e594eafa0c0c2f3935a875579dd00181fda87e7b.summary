thieves who target wealthy department stores should get lighter sentences than if they steal from a corner shop , a senior @entity4 mp claims today			2
@entity6 , an @entity7 minister and barrister , said the likes of luxury goods shop @entity11 and @entity12 could more easily absorb the loss			1
the @entity15 mayoral candidate wants the law to be changed so the seriousness of shoplifting is decided by the impact on the victim – rather than the monetary value of the item stolen			1
but @entity24 @entity15 mayor @entity23 today condemned the ' absurd ' idea , insisting it was wrong to ' minimise shoplifting from swish , posh shops '			1
@entity15 mayoral hopeful @entity6 says thieves who target wealthy department stores should get lighter sentences than if they steal from a corner shop experts also warned it would make shoplifters more likely to target supermarkets			1
justice secretary @entity35 said : ‘ @entity4 ’s justice policies are pretty thin on the ground at the best of times , but this latest contribution hardly seems a sensible one			0
‘ all forms of stealing are wrong – and suggesting that some people are better able to afford being the victim of it sends all the wrong sorts of messages			0
’ mr @entity23 branded mr @entity6 's comments ‘ absurd ’			1
he told @entity50 radio : ' if he is seriously saying that we should discount or minimise shoplifting from swish , posh shops then i think he is totally wrong because it is a crime wherever it is committed			2
' it ’s important to crack down on it			0
@entity59 ’s have got oodles of money – or actually slightly less than they used to – but it does n’t mean it ’s right to nick stuff from anywhere			0
' that ’s why we are cracking down on burglary and shoplifting			2
' currently , the law decides what constitutes a ‘ serious ’ shoplifting offence on the basis of an item ’s value			1
in a pamphlet for the @entity79 think - tank , @entity76 mp mr @entity6 says : ‘ the impact of a £ 150 theft , for example , would be far greater on an independent corner shop than on @entity11 , yet this is not reflected under the current @entity85			1
‘ it is self - evident that the impact of a £ 200 theft to a large retailer is much smaller that it would be to a small , independent retailer			1
' many rightly argue that the seriousness of shoplifting should not be based on the value , but on the impact to the victim			1
’ less impact : the @entity15 mayoral candidate believes thieves should receive more lenient punishments for stealing from stores such as @entity11 than from corner shops @entity24 @entity15 mayor @entity23 today condemned the ' absurd ' idea , insisting it was wrong to ' minimise shoplifting from swish , posh shops '			1
the idea will prove hugely controversial as , for the first time , it would make the wealth of the victim a factor in deciding sentencing			0
critics warn it is a slippery slope which might lead to other crimes – such as burglary – being added to the list			0
but mr @entity6 , whose constituency was hit by rioting in 2011 , insists : ‘ as with most types of property crime , the social costs of shoplifting are regressive – they hit poorest communities hardest			1
mr @entity6 's idea will prove hugely controversial as , for the first time , it would make the wealth of the victim a factor in deciding sentencing ‘ small local businesses in more deprived areas , operating on small profit / loss margins , are least able to absorb the costs of theft and are obliged to pass these costs on to their customers through increased prices			1
’ @entity136 , a criminologist and director of the @entity139 think - tank , said : ‘ what any sensible legal system is doing is weighing up the degree of moral responsibility of the person who perpetrated the act			0
‘ it is completely wrong to punish someone more severely because they stole from a poor person than if they stole from a supermarket			0
‘ it would encourage people to steal from supermarkets rather than elsewhere because they would know they would get a lighter sentence			2
’ mr @entity6 ’s @entity79 report , which will be launched at a speech in @entity15 today , warns the police and the courts are turning a blind eye to property crime			1
some one in three burglaries and nine in ten shoplifting incidents are not reported to the police because the victims have no faith the case will be properly dealt with			0
@entity169 , of the @entity170 , said : ‘ any suggestion a crime against a retailer or staff should be treated any differently because of the type of store , or the place it ’s in , is absolutely nonsensical			0
‘ retailers are at the heart of every community , whether that ’s a high - end shop in @entity182 or one in @entity6 ’s constituency of @entity76			2
‘ crimes against them are not victimless , they have a direct impact on the local community			0
wherever the crime takes place , shoplifters should be persecuted as they normally would be			0
’ shoplifting has been repeatedly downgraded in seriousness by the authorities over the past decade			2
the process began when @entity4 announced that , where the items stolen were worth less than £ 200 , the offender could escape with an £ 80 on - the - spot fine instead of going to court			0
in many cases , the offenders simply do n’t bother to pay .			0

@entity6 believes law should be changed to consider impact of theft
@entity15 mayoral candidate puts this *ahead* of monetary value of item stolen
@entity23 says it is ' absurd ' to ever suggest it is ok to steal
currently seriousness of shoplifting is decided on stolen *product* 's value
