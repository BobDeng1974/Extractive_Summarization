spider attack : actress @entity1 was stricken by an infected bite a cold sunday morning last december , and i ’m up at the crack of dawn			1
my lovely hairdresser @entity6 has agreed to come to my home in @entity8 at 8am , as i then have to race back to @entity9 for panto rehearsals — i ’m an actress and tv presenter and this is my first venture into pantomime			2
i am slightly perturbed , however , as i have woken to find a weird , golf - ball sized blister just above my right ankle			1
it does n’t hurt , but it is quite hot and angry - looking , and i ’m mystified as to what it can be			1
at @entity6 ’s insistence , i call @entity21 while he ’s cutting my hair			2
in less than two hours , i am sitting opposite the out - of - hours gp who advises me to not lance it ( i so want to )			1
he says it looks like a bite or a burn			1
i do n’t see how it can be the latter , and although i ’m a magnet for mosquitoes , i ’ve never had a bite this big before and it is winter			1
i try to ignore it , hoping the swelling will disappear as quickly as it came on			2
the following friday we have our first performance of @entity38 — i play @entity39 , the @entity40			2
unfortunately , the blister has burst overnight and wo n’t stop weeping — though it is a relief not to have an egg - shaped lump on my ankle any more			1
my legs are on view on stage and the lump had been difficult to disguise			2
my husband , @entity48 , also an actor , renames the show ‘ @entity49 ’ , which i find very funny			0
one week later and it ’s our @entity51 , but i ’m not feeling very festive — i ’m dosed up with horse - strength antibiotics as the blister has become infected			1
i ’ve been back and forth to the local gp , where my wound is dressed every other day			0
my nurse , @entity57 , tells me she ’s seen this before and is convinced it ’s the result of a false widow spider bite			1
the bite is now a small , yellowy - green , glutinous crater			1
it ’s not painful — just revolting			0
later , my husband discovers a shiny , black spider in an outside crevice of the cottage in @entity68 i ’m renting while in the show			1
it took three months after the bite first appeared , before @entity1 could cast boot and bandages aside it does n’t look very threatening as it ’s quite small , but it does have long legs and a bulbous body with some strange , creamy - white markings			1
@entity81 ‘ false widow spiders ’ and it fits the description			1
there are seven types of false widow spider in the @entity86 , but the kind associated with bites is the noble false widow ( @entity90 )			1
it ’s one of a dozen larger species of spider in @entity86 that can give a nasty bite			1
apparently , noble false widows — about 2 cm wide , including their legs — nest anywhere that ’s dark and damp			1
i think of piles of wood shavings near the cottage , which i trod on in the dark one night			0
@entity103 , manager of the identification and advisory service at the @entity106 and an expert on false widows , says the noble false widow has been increasingly common in the @entity110 for the past ten years or so			1
the spiders were first sighted in @entity112 in 1879 , and were thought to have hitched a ride here on a boat importing bananas — but now they are migrating north from there , possibly due to climate change			1
‘ their numbers are increasing , and as a result , more people are reporting bites , ’ he says			0
it ’s just a shame one has settled in @entity68			0
' i spend the next couple of months keeping my feet up wherever i go , ' said @entity1 i ca n’t stop searching for information on false widows			1
they are n’t aggressive and will only bite if provoked ( for example , if you try to prod them or if they are caught in clothing ) , but the skull - like markings on their bodies are sinister			1
although the noble false widow has been described as @entity86 ’s most venomous spider , a bite will typically only cause a small swelling and numbness — similar in scale to a wasp or bee sting			1
for most people , keeping the bite clean and applying an antihistamine bite cream will help it heal in a few days			1
but it ’s now nearly three weeks since i was bitten and my leg has gone from bad to worse			0
on christmas eve , my friend @entity149 helps me tend to what is now a suppurating ulcer the size of 10 p coin			0
we joke about calling the panto ‘ @entity156 in @entity157 ’ , but i ’m feeling quite down			0
our final performance is just before @entity159			0
my dresser @entity161 is also a trained nurse , so she has by turns been zipping me up and applying industrial - sized plasters to my leg			1
she thinks it may not clear up until the spring , so i add ‘ rapid healing ’ to my @entity159 ’s resolutions			0
back home in @entity8 and with the show over , i ’m feeling scared			0
i ’m on my third course of antibiotics and the thing is still growing			0
tests have revealed a streptococcal bacterial infection , and my gp seems out of his depth , saying he ’s never witnessed this kind of bite			2
@entity103 says in cases where bites cause a wound that wo n’t heal it ’s most likely a secondary infection with bacteria that ’s the problem : ‘ horror stories you hear about large wounds or limbs going black are likely to be down to an infection similar to necrotising fasciitis , where bacterial infection leads to tissue dying off			2
’ he adds it ’s difficult for medics to get a clear picture of how much damage the venom itself can cause			0
doctors may not see a bite until it ’s already infected			1
‘ there have been claims that bacteria are injected by the spider along with its venom , but there ’s little evidence for this			2
' it ’s the same as any scratch or puncture to the skin — there ’s a risk of infection and some people ’s immune systems do n’t shrug it off as easily , ’ he says			2
my gp is increasingly concerned and we agree i should see a specialist			0
i get a private appointment with @entity223 , professor of dermatological medicine at @entity225 in @entity226 , who confirms a false widow spider is the most likely culprit			1
the first thing you should do is wash the area thoroughly with soap and water to prevent infection — and do n’t scratch , as if you break the skin there ’s more chance for bacteria to get in			2
cover bites with a plaster and apply an antihistamine sting cream to calm any inflammation or itching , says @entity103 , from the @entity106 ’s identification and advisory service			0
any redness , pain or swelling should subside after three days			0
be alert to potential signs of infection , such as weeping blisters or painful swelling , that continue to get worse after a few days			0
if this happens , seek advice from your gp			0
he recommends compression therapy — an ultra-firm leg bandage to squeeze my leg , encouraging blood flow to and from the area to promote healing			0
i also have to elevate my legs as much as possible			0
he warns i ’m still looking at a minimum of three months for my ( now chronic ) ulcer to get better — apparently just above the ankle is the worst area for healing			2
the ulcer also has to be regularly debrided ( where they clean out the gunk and dead tissue ) at hospital			0
it ’s not as painful as it sounds			0
the weeks go by and the ulcer has decreased a little , though i now have to wear a blue surgical boot as i ca n’t get any other shoes over the bandage			2
it means that filming of my new tv series , @entity288 , is postponed			0
i spend the next couple of months keeping my feet up wherever i go			0
finally , at the beginning of march , three months after the bite first appeared , i cast boot and bandages aside			1
the ulcer is shrinking — it no longer weeps , and neither do i. with my leg on the mend at last , we can begin filming			0
dr @entity300 , from @entity302 ’s @entity301 , thinks i got off lightly			0
‘ bacteria in the bite can cause nasty ulceration and i have heard of amputations as a result of false widow spider bites , ’ she says			1
the only fly , or should i say spider , in the ointment ( sorry ) is a conspicuous 2cm round brown scar			2
but at least i have n’t been left with a permanent dent in my leg , which @entity315 and @entity316 , the specialist nurses in @entity226 who applied my bandages , had warned me was a distinct possibility			2
all of which means that i ’m free to return to panto in @entity9 this year			0
i can say with all honesty i really have been bitten by the panto bug			0
@entity1 and @entity323 co-present @entity288 on @entity324			1

golf - ball sized blister appeared just above @entity1 *'s* right ankle
after a week , the blister became infected and ' looked hot and angry '
caused by ' false widow spider ' - there are seven types in the @entity86
the spiders are n’t aggressive and will only bite if they *'re* provoked
