by @entity0 a horrifying catalogue of serious errors at @entity4 hospitals in @entity5 has come to light , following a @entity8 request			1
they include a report from @entity11 where a patient on oxygen therapy died in an explosion after lighting a cigarette in a hospital toilet			1
in another shocking case , @entity17 and @entity18 revealed a patient died after they were stuck in a lift while being transferred to intensive care			1
the oxygen supply they were receiving and suction equipment ran out during the time they were trapped			2
warning : two patients using oxygen died after they got too close to a heat source another report from the same @entity33 revealed a patient with pneumonia who died did n't receive medication for nine days after they were admitted because the pharmacy failed to deliver the drugs			1
these examples made up a handful of the 345 @entity4 reports from last year , that were only released following an @entity8 request from @entity45			1
reasons for deaths or illness included receiving the wrong doses of medication or emergency treatment not being available			1
more than 100 deaths resulted from the incidents reported by @entity5 hospitals			1
however , the number is likely to be far higher as only seven of the 19 boards supplied the number of adverse incidents they had recorded over the past year in response to the @entity8 request			1
despite this , it is the first time a clearer picture for the whole of @entity5 has emerged , because unlike @entity68 and @entity69 , there is no national system for reporting serious incidents			1
the documents show variations between health boards in the number of incidents that are reported and what types of investigations are conducted			2
differences in what each board considers to be ' serious ' are also apparent , with incident reports ranging from a nurse being injured while hanging @entity84 decorations to a baby dying during labour and a surgeon removing a patient 's healthy organ			2
work overload : a number of serious incidents revealed @entity4 staff who had not received adequate training @entity5 's largest health board , @entity95 and @entity96 , reported 95 incidents last year despite serving the largest population compared to @entity99 , which noted 138			1
the study also highlights that all of @entity104 's reports list ' nearly identical ' learning points			2
the @entity45 investigation also found that the @entity4 has paid out over £ 120 million in compensation and legal expenses over the last three years in @entity5			1
in two individual cases , @entity108 paid out a total of over £ 6 million			0
@entity111 , the @entity112 , has called for a national system for reporting serious incidents			2
@entity114 & @entity18 @entity115 died after an oxygen mask they were wearing got too close after a heat source and exploded			2
inexperienced nurse incorrectly administered medication which caused the death of the patient			1
@entity115 died after treatment ran out while they were stuck in a lift on transfer to intensive care			2
borders , dumfries & @entity130 stillborn baby allocated a community number by a midwife so was recorded as being alive			0
@entity134 distressed after receiving a birthday card through a public health initiative			0
@entity137 patient on oxygen therapy died in explosion after lighting a cigarette in the toilet			1
@entity143 @entity144 stapled the wrong organs together during elective surgery			1
@entity147 a pad used during a surgical procedure was unaccounted for and staff could n't locate it using x-ray			0
he said : ' i think one of the things that your ( the @entity45 's ) inquiries have highlighted is that across @entity5 just now we 're pretty confused about what we call things , what things mean and whether for example a critical incident review is a health and safety review , whether it 's a review of something that 's gone wrong surgically or in a gp 's surgery or in a dental surgery			1
' it 's a confusing picture			0
i think if we had a simple national system it would be far easier to ask a simple question of the health service and get a clear statistical answer			0
' the @entity179 said it has asked for an urgent review of incident reporting from @entity182 ( @entity182 ) , the body set up to support @entity4 and other healthcare providers deliver high quality and safe services			0
@entity45 @entity5 said that , in the programme , @entity186 , director of scrutiny and assurance at @entity182 , admits they have no idea of the national picture , and that the officials will be visiting each health board from now until the end of next year			1
a total of 22 complaints are made against the @entity4 every day and the numbers being upheld by the @entity112 have increased			0
mr @entity111 said : ' last year we upheld something like 56 per cent of the complaints , which is a very worrying number particularly given that the year before the number was only 43 per cent			0
' there seems to be an increase in the number of complaints not being resolved satisfactorily in health boards			0
' where i 'm worried is that if the trend continues , it will dilute the confidence of the population			0
' i can only assume that if we get the learning better , then that will save lives			0
' at the moment , the bureaucracy seems from the outside to be the most important thing			0
in my view the learning should be the most important thing			0
' a @entity179 spokeswoman said a national framework for the management of adverse events is being put in place			0
' @entity5 is the first country in the world to implement a national patient safety programme across the whole healthcare system and has some of the safest hospitals in the world , ' she said			1
' we need to support a culture of openness , trust and quality improvement so that we can make sure that lessons are learned from these events			0
' earlier this year , the health secretary ordered an investigation in @entity17 and @entity18 after the health board withheld more than 50 reports on serious incidents at its hospitals and clinics			2
the @entity45 revealed that some of that @entity33 's reports were so heavily redacted ( blacking out sections ) that they were almost incomprehensible			0
@entity248 : how @entity249 ? airs on @entity250 at 10.35pm tonight			0
