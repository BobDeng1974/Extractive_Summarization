@entity0 and @entity1 both crossed twice as @entity2 dominated their @entity4 dead rubber against a young @entity6 outfit at @entity7			1
both sides were out of the running in @entity10 , but the @entity12 province salvaged some pride with a runaway 65 - 10 bonus - point victory that included eight second - half tries			1
an early @entity0 effort launched @entity2 towards a 10 - 0 lead , before the stubborn @entity18 rallied with a tremendous @entity20 score and just three points separated the sides at the break			1
@entity2 full back @entity0 ( centre ) breaks away during his side 's second - half rout of sale however , after @entity29 crowned his first start of the season with an excellent individual try and a penalty try was added , the floodgates were well and truly opened as @entity35 , @entity0 , @entity1 ( two ) , @entity36 and @entity37 all touched down between the 65th and 80th minutes			1
@entity0 , who shifted to full - back , reserves some of his best @entity40 performances for round six , including memorable hat - tricks against @entity43 ( 2012 ) and @entity44 ( 2013 )			1
he was on the scoresheet here within 90 seconds , stepping inside @entity47 and stretching over to score past two covering defenders			0
@entity49 was keen to press his claims for the @entity52 number 10 jersey , nailing a difficult first conversion from the right and quickly adding a penalty			0
@entity56 duly got @entity6 off the mark , but obstruction at the restart saw @entity49 immediately respond			0
the @entity2 fly - half blotted his copybook , though , when allowing @entity20 to fend him off near the left touchline as the @entity6 winger ran in a terrific solo try from outside the @entity2 22			1
@entity56 's conversion made it a three - point game			2
@entity2 winger @entity1 crashes over for the first of his two tries at @entity7 the visitors made further inroads thanks to a series of sloppy @entity2 penalties			1
referee @entity73 lost his patience when @entity1 killed the ball near his try - line and the wing was promptly sin - binned			0
the scores dried up during a niggly second quarter as @entity6 failed to take advantage of their numerical advantage and @entity49 pushed a 40 - metre penalty wide			0
but @entity29 lit up the second half with a try in the opening minute , taking a great line to gather an @entity87 offload , dashing clear over halfway and finding a way past covering full - back @entity89			1
television match official @entity91 confirmed the grounding and @entity49 converted for 20 - 10			0
the @entity2 pack took over approaching the hour mark , winning a penalty try from a dominant five - metre scrum			2
@entity49 converted but some brilliant breakdown work saw @entity6 slow the province 's bonus - point push			0
that was until @entity49 's inviting inside pass released @entity103 for a very well - taken score under the posts			2
@entity0 then completed his brace with an opportunist try , cleverly rolling from the back of a close - in ruck to reach over and make it 39 - 10			2
as replacements @entity87 and @entity112 increased their influence , @entity2 showed no mercy to the demoralised @entity18			0
@entity87 and @entity0 combined to send @entity1 clear , flanker @entity36 crashed over from close range and prop @entity116 provided the initial break and the scoring pass for @entity37 ' touchdown			0
there was still time for @entity0 to break through the tired @entity6 defence and supply the assist for @entity1 's second try			0
replacement @entity125 's third successful conversion gave @entity2 their highest ever score in @entity40 rugby - beating their 64 points in a 64 - 0 win over @entity131 in december 2002 .			1

both sides were out of the running in @entity135 of the @entity4
@entity2 ran in nine tries during rout at @entity7
@entity0 *impressed* at full - back for home side
@entity29 scored a superb individual try in the second - half
it was @entity2 's highest - ever score in a @entity40 rugby game
