one of @entity1 's top entrepreneurs has unveiled a new plan to build a block of flats worth as much as £ 2billion on the site of an ugly multi-storey car park			1
@entity7 , the founder of @entity8 , bought the @entity10 garage in @entity11 , central @entity12 for £ 155million in order to knock it down and build a high - end housing complex			1
the new apartment block will contain five townhouses , three penthouses , a mews home and 21 more luxury flats , rivalling properties such as one @entity21 for the title of the world 's most desirable living space			1
luxury : @entity26 is set to be a complex of houses , luxury flats and penthouses in @entity11 , central @entity12 contrast : most of the plot is currently taken up by an ugly parking garage which is set to be knocked down by owner @entity7 but it could face trouble getting planning permission - as @entity39 neighbours may object to the building works needed to build four levels of basements as well as nine storeys above the ground			1
each townhouse and penthouse will have its own gym and swimming pool , while the penthouses will have dedicated lifts to ensure their owners ' privacy			2
entrepreneur : the @entity8 founder , pictured with his partner @entity55 , is known as a prolific investor in @entity11 property the development 's communal facilities will include a 15 - metre swimming pool , a business centre for holding meetings , a gym , spa and cinema and games room			1
plans for the ambitious complex were submitted to @entity69 this week after being put together by @entity71 architects @entity72 , which beat 30 rivals to the job			2
@entity26 is regarded as a ' super prime ' scheme - with one agent saying it could reach £ 10,000 per sq / ft , valuing it at £ 2billion in total			2
@entity79 , director of @entity81 estate agents , said @entity26 was ' one of the most exciting residential projects ever unveiled in @entity12 '			0
she estimated it would sell for £ 5,500 - £ 7,000 per sq / ft , rising as high as £ 10,000 per sq / ft in the next few years			0
ms @entity79 said : ' @entity7 's visionary proposals will replace an unsightly multi-storey concrete car park at 5 @entity87 and convert it into a super-prime residential project			1
' the @entity87 project will create a new luxury village for @entity11 and will rival one @entity21 as @entity12 's best luxury address			1
' @entity92 from @entity11 - based pastor @entity93 said : ' speculation on plans to develop the @entity87 car park have been going almost as long as i 've been in @entity11 , long before the £ 150 million deal to purchase the site in 2011			1
' there have been many twists and turns , initially refused by the planning officer , @entity69 council then overturned this , now the plans have been revised and resubmitted			0
' whatever happens , due to the scale of investment already ploughed into this i do n't doubt the finished development will be one of the most super-prime schemes in @entity11			2
' desirable : the complex is set to fetch as much as £ 2billion in total when it goes on to the market , according to one estate agent plan : this map shows how the development will include five townhouses as well as a courtyard garden towering : the property will reach nine storeys , as well as four basement levels to be excavated below ground @entity128 of @entity129 added : ' @entity11 is becoming increasingly residential as commercial leases granted after @entity131 on previously residential addresses come to an end and those properties are reinstated to their original use			1
' yet where it has lagged behind other areas such as @entity139 and @entity140 is in its provision of 21st century full - service apartment buildings			0
' what @entity11 has lacked until now is a building to rival one @entity21 and 199 @entity139			2
@entity87 is set to be a game changer			0
' mr @entity7 , 62 , has previously described the location as being ' the best site in the world but with some of the ugliest buildings ' , and promised his stone - clad development will be ' very beautiful '			2
contrast : this image shows how the huge building will tower over the street it is on , compared to the modest development there now stylish : mr @entity7 claims that many buildings in the area are very ugly and is keen to restore the district 's elegance overhaul : the vista will be almost unrecognisable when the complex is built - but it has to get planning permission first he does not plan to include any affordable housing as part of the complex - and will instead pay @entity69 more than £ 8million in compensation			1
if the property is sold for its maximum price , the @entity172 could gain as much as £ 100million in stamp duty			0
however , ms @entity79 warned that powerful locals might not be happy with the years of building works which would be likely to ensue in the area			0
' the project will have a lower ground floor and four basement levels , this will be a major engineering scheme , ' she said			0
' the neighbours are powerful and include the @entity185 of @entity186 , the @entity187 and very wealthy apartment owners who will expect the site construction to be managed to the highest levels to ensure no noise or construction impact and they will expect constantly clean roads			0
' map : another projection of how the finished development will look which was submitted to @entity69 planners eyesore : the current car park is an undistinguished modern building with a monolithic brick frontage mr @entity7 has previously made a number of significant investments in @entity11 - he is currently spending millions on converting two houses into a single mega-mansion , and he also owns the house next to @entity87 , which has been rented out for £ 15,000 per week			1
a spokesman for the development project declined to comment on the newly revealed plans			0
billionaire : mr @entity7 founded @entity8 and sold his business for £ 1.5billion @entity7 rose from humble beginnings to become one of the wealthiest men in @entity1 thanks to the @entity8 business empire			1
he left school before taking his a-levels and worked as an apprentice at @entity222 - but while working at the tyre firm , he started a mail - order business selling clothing to motorbike fans			0
mr @entity7 was living in a caravan when he and his brother cooked up a plan to sell mobile phones , then considered an expensive luxury with huge profit margins			1
in 1987 he bought 26 phones from @entity233 and took eight months to sell them all , but that turned out to be the origins of a company which would help define the burgeoning mobile market			0
nearly 20 years later , mr @entity7 cashed out by selling the last of his businesses for £ 1.5billion , and at that point he became a noted philanthropist , giving to causes such as the @entity243 and the @entity245 memorial			2
he has a son with his partner @entity55 , as well as four other children from previous relationships			0
last year his son @entity250 revealed that he was struggling with agoraphobia , and finds it almost impossible to leave the house			0
as well as his properties in @entity11 , mr @entity7 owns 50 - room @entity255 in @entity256 , where he is currently building a private miniature railway to transport him and his guests around the estate .			1

@entity7 has bought a car park in @entity10 , @entity11 and is planning to replace it with a huge block of flats
the new complex will contain five townhouses , a mews house , three penthouses and 21 more luxury apartments
the homes being built by @entity8 entrepreneur will boast their own swimming pools and private gyms
but he could have difficulty with planning permission if @entity39 neighbours object to proposal for four - storey basement
