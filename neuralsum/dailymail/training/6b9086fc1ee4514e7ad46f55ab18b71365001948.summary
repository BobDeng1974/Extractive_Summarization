mass production : @entity1 has changed over the years there was a time when it was marketed as the ultimate health drink , a glass of sunshine packed with vitamins and energy			1
generations were raised to believe orange juice fights off colds , boosts the immune system , tones the skin and protects against cancer			1
yet in the topsy - turvy world of health advice , what ’s good for you one day , turns out to be bad for you the next			1
this week an influential body of @entity23 scientists blamed @entity25 ’s love affair with orange juice and other sugary drinks for fuelling a crisis of obesity and ill health			1
the warning follows calls to remove fruit juice as one of the recommended ‘ five a day ’ portions of fruit or vegetables , and for parents to ban it from the meal table			1
so if fruit juice turns out to be such a devil in disguise , why have we all been led to believe it was so healthy for so long ? the idea goes back to the 1920s , when @entity48 nutritionist @entity47 blamed a condition called acidosis , an excess of acid in the blood , on diets rich in bread and meat			1
his bizarre solution was lots of lettuce and — paradoxically — acidic citrus fruits			0
at the time orange juice was not hugely popular , but fruit growers leapt on the acidosis panic and sales rose			1
juice got an even bigger boost thanks to @entity68 when the @entity23 wanted a new way to get a product rich in vitamin c to troops overseas			1
it poured money into research			0
in 1947 — just in time for the post-war consumer boom — scientists invented a way to remove water from juice and freeze the concentrate into a palatable product			1
the blocks of this concentrate could be sold to the new fridge - owning @entity48 consumers or stored by manufacturers for months at a time , and sales exploded			1
meanwhile in the @entity25 , war babies had been given rose hip , blackcurrant and concentrated orange juice by the government as a cheap nutrition supplement in the 1940s			1
this continued into the 1950s , seeding the idea in a generation of baby boomers that juice is healthy			1
by the 1980s orange juice was being marketed not just as a health drink , but also as the key to a stylish , modern life — a status it enjoys today			1
but while the juice in the supermarket is often sold as ‘ natural ’ or ‘ fresh ’ , it is usually anything but			1
concentrating juice does n’t just remove water , it also removes the flavour			1
after it has been reconstituted , manufacturers add ‘ flavour packs ’ — cocktails of chemicals which restore ‘ natural ’ oranginess			0
you may think ‘ not from concentrate ’ juice means a more authentic product			2
juice made that way is heated and stored in air - free tanks for up to a year			1
again , the process strips the juice of flavour , which has to be added afterwards			2
but the flavour packs contain orange essence and orange oil so do n’t have to appear separately on the ingredients list			0
breakfast ! but while juice contains many vitamins and minerals , there is no fibre - and a lot of sugar manufacturers say they help give their product a consistent flavour			1
they also explain why juice in cartons does n’t taste like fresh juice			2
‘ @entity147 ’ is n’t the only dubious claim made for juice			2
for decades , health gurus , and some doctors , have claimed the vitamin c in juice fights common colds			1
but while the immune system needs vitamin c , there ’s little evidence that regularly taking the stuff prevents colds			0
research shows that the best that can be claimed for vitamin c is that it might shorten colds by a day or two			0
given that most of us get two colds a year , worrying about vitamin c every day seems an over-reaction			0
there ’s another myth about vitamin c , that citrus fruits are the best source			0
yet plenty of vegetables , including broccoli , potatoes , kale and peppers , have doses comparable to those in fruit			0
what you will get from juice is sugar			1
lots and lots of it			0
the new advice this week from the @entity185 on @entity186 is that men should have a maximum of 35g of sugar a day — seven to eight teaspoons — while women should not exceed 25g — five to six teaspoons			2
a single 330ml glass of orange juice has eight teaspoons			2
@entity193 , spokeswoman for the @entity194 , says : ‘ people have lost sight of how much sugar is in food and portion sizes have got bigger			2
a 150ml glass provides one of your five a day and anything more than that does n’t count			0
but measure people ’s glasses and they are often 250ml			0
‘ juice provides a lot of vitamins and minerals , but unlike fresh fruit you do n’t get the healthy fibre			1
’ doctors say the huge volume of sugar in our diet is contributing to the obesity epidemic , causing heart disease , cancer and diabetes			2
there is growing concern that not all sugars are the same — and that fructose , the type found in fruit , may be more harmful than table sugar			2
@entity48 hormone scientist @entity231 argues that it does more damage to the liver and cells than glucose or sucrose			0
he says excessive fructose intake is key to rising obesity and diabetes levels			0
there is even evidence that fructose may contribute to higher uric acid levels in the blood — and increase the risk of gout , an excruciatingly painful condition that is becoming ever more common			0
@entity1 can also rot your teeth			0
around half of five - year - olds have signs of damage to their tooth enamel , and too much fruit juice is thought to be a key cause			1
there have been signs this year , however , that the tide is turning			0
schools have been leading the way			0
in january , @entity264 , the head of @entity265 in @entity266 , @entity267 , told parents that pupils would not be allowed juice in their lunch boxes			2
instead , they had to drink water			0
around that time , professor @entity273 , the government ’s obesity tsar , said juice should n’t count towards your five a day			2
‘ fruit juice is absorbed very fast , ’ she said , ‘ so by the time it gets to your stomach , your body does n’t know whether it ’s @entity279 or orange juice , frankly			0
i have to say it is a relatively easy thing to give up			0
if you are going to drink it , you should dilute it			0
’ weaning @entity25 off fruit juice may be difficult			0
market research firm @entity290 says 83 per cent of us drink fruit juice or a smoothie at least once a week , while 76 per cent believe fruit juice to be healthy			1
but if you need motivation when you sit down to breakfast , remember this : there is more sugar in a 250ml glass of fruit juice than in a large bowl of @entity303 with milk			1
and that ’s food for thought .			0

juice was popularised after @entity68 as cheap health supplement
but mass production *methods* take away much of what makes it healthy
juices give many vitamins and minerals - but no fibre and a lot of sugar
