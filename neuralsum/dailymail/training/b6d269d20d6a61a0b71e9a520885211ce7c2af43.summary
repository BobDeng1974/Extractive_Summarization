dr @entity0 , the chemist who developed the birth control pill , died aged 91 on friday girls today take it for granted			1
a rite of passage into adulthood , a hygienic routine , almost a human right			2
for the great majority , the modern low - dose oral contraceptive arouses little wonder , creates no health anxieties and raises no eyebrows ( unless the taker is scandalously far below the age of consent )			2
the @entity16 still forbids it and some stay faithful to that rule , but as one @entity21 friend observed ironically : ' it 's astonishing how often the @entity23 sends us @entity16 families just two babies			1
' the @entity27 , in short , is no longer a marvel			1
indeed , any young woman who watches @entity32 , the @entity34 drama set in the @entity35 , will , at some point , ask : ' why on earth do these women living in hovels with hordes of small children keep having more babies ? ' to modern eyes , pregnancy is a simple choice			2
few women who take the @entity27 , until reports of his death last friday at the age of 91 , would have known that this can largely be credited to one man , the chemist @entity0			1
he arrived in the @entity52 as a penniless refugee from @entity55 - occupied @entity54 , and was himself a virgin when he married at 19			2
in later years , after his invention , he reflected that — without meaning to — he had sparked a social , as well as a scientific , revolution : not to mention a financial splash as his pharmaceutical company broke records on @entity62			1
this major breakthrough in human development , as so often happens , was an accident			2
in 1951 , he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen — mimicking the female sex hormone known as ' nature 's contraceptive ' and so preventing ovulation			1
no egg released , no pregnancy			0
the first pills were tough stuff , and takers had side - effects : nausea , weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure ( i knew one woman who nearly died )			1
gradually , synthetic oestrogen was added and refinements produced the low - dose combined pills of today			0
it was in 1960 that @entity91 got the pill : it was hailed as a breakthrough , not for general sexual liberation but for domestic and family harmony			1
pregnancies now could be spaced out and planned for			0
the @entity27 sparked a social , as well as a scientific , revolution and it was hailed as a breakthrough for domestic and family harmony the old latex contraceptive barriers could be discarded with relief , though a few women mistrusted chemicals and stayed with the good old diaphragm			1
initially , the pill was used only by married women			1
it was n't until 1964 that clinics and doctors agreed to prescribe it for single women and young girls			0
and even a few years later , when i got my first prescription , the family planning clinic was an ordeal			0
although some of my 1968 college intake boasted that their mums had ' put them ' on the @entity27 , outside that @entity122 bubble , the truth is that the @entity123 did n't really get going until well into the @entity124			1
so in a small - town clinic you were still questioned closely about the seriousness of your relationship ( it was assumed you had just one ) and offered embarrassing advice by a stern nurse			0
i had one memorably excruciating moment : i disgraced myself in the clinic by clumsily dropping the instructional plastic model of the reproductive system and having to crawl under a table to find a lost fallopian tube			0
t he next day , after taking my first pill , i went in to work at the local radio station and my first job was to interview a family planning nurse			1
we avoided one another 's eyes			2
@entity0 came to understand that he was partly responsible for a sexual revolution : in his book @entity27 , he said that the invention made him more interested in how science affects society			1
@entity151 , he said : ' the explosion was much faster than anyone expected			0
' the first pills were tough stuff , and takers had side - effects : nausea , weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure interestingly , he was fiercely opposed by feminists including @entity165			2
he recalled some ' unusually bitter exchanges ' with her and accepted that some women thought he was to be distrusted as a patriarchal male scientist who was poisoning women with chemicals so men could have their way with them			0
as for the idea of a male pill , he memorably said : ' scientifically , we solved that a number of years ago			2
would you , as a woman , put your entire reproductive risk in the trust that he has remembered his @entity175 ? ' good point			0
and it is the social , psychological consequences we have to reflect on now			2
whenever science puts a new tool into the hands of humans — whether it 's dynamite , gunpowder , the internet or the @entity27 — there will be both good and bad ways we use it			1
the huge benefits of protection from unexpected , unwanted pregnancy are obvious , not only for the young and single			0
we have lost the stigma of illegitimacy — and good riddance , i am just old enough to remember the era of shame — but even now a missed period can produce heart - shaking horror			0
a career , a life - plan , a relationship melt before your eyes : the idea of termination is instinctively abhorrent to many , but there is real misery in feeling your body being hijacked , taken over by an uncontrollable alien process you were n't braced for			0
before the @entity27 , remember , that often happened — even to the most instinctively ' moral ' girls			1
( incidentally , @entity0 himself ruefully admitted of his second marriage : ' i , the person who synthesised the first pill , married another woman because i got her pregnant			1
' he later had a vasectomy			0
) but it also became clear that men would take it for granted that women were using the @entity27			1
by the mid-seventies , the assumption was growing that if a woman was n't ' fixed up ' , there was something weird about her			0
previously , the risk of pregnancy had at least made it easier for an unwilling girl , even a girl in love , to say ' no ' to full sex			0
it offered a breather , a chance to slow down courtship ( what a forgotten word that is ) and ask , as in the @entity251 song : ' is this a lasting treasure , or just a moment 's pleasure ? ' the pressure to ' do it ' anyway grew as the @entity27 became a norm			1
he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen , pictured is dr @entity0 in 1940 i remember being indignantly told it was ' selfish ' not to give in to a particular lad , as if women 's bodies were a natural resource it was mean to hoard			1
it is daft to overstate the ' damage to moral fabric ' argument			0
@entity0 himself admitted that the sexual revolution — the separation of sex - for - babies and sex - for - fun — began before his discovery , and would probably have rolled on anyway , though more slowly			1
but there is no point denying he speeded it up			0
a nd that alongside the joy and ease and intimacy and happiness of liberated sex , there has been anxiety and unease and a nasty notion — now at least challenged by young feminists — that women 's bodies are a commodity for men 's convenience , and that sex , that most marvellous of connections , need not involve any intimacy or trust or faith on either side			2
the @entity27 has had one other effect , which no one thought about much at the time , but which now ticks like a time - bomb in the heart of every bright professional woman			1
the phrase ' family planning ' and the rarity of surprise - babies nowadays has deceived too many of us into taking it literally			0
@entity0 predicted a future when his own invention would become redundant , with men and women doing away with the need for contraception altogether by being sterilised — withdrawing their frozen eggs and sperm from a ' bank ' when they were ready to have a child via @entity326			1
already it is easy to assume that we can put off babies until our 40s , or even 50s , and trust science to give nature a hand			0
but it does n't always work			0
the fact is , the ferocious , uncontrollable , youthful fertility which once bred panic does fade , over long years of contraception			0
and sometimes , it gets too late to have a baby			0
but these issues aside , may @entity0 rest in peace			1
on balance , he gave a great thing to womankind and fearless happiness to millions of honest lovers			0
as with all inventions , it 's up to us to use it wisely .			2
