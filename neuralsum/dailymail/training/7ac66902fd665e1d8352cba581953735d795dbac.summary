but now those suffering from hair loss and baldness could finally have an answer to their prayers - without resorting to a comb - over , toupee or hair transplant			1
a new hair product on sale in salons from this week claims to not only stop hair loss , but also stimulate new growth			1
the treatment @entity21 , which has been hailed as a ‘ major breakthrough ’ , stimulates the scalp to wake up dormant follicles			2
baldness cure : a new hair loss treatment claims to stimulate growth by waking up dormant follicles on the scalp scientists have found that many of those suffering from hair loss or balding have skin tissue in the scalp that has an oxygen deficiency – a condition called hypoxia			1
they have developed a molecule called stemoxydine that targets this condition by attempting to increase oxygen levels in the scalp			0
the increase aims to help follicles to produce thicker hair and stimulate hair growth in areas where the follicles have shut down			2
the @entity48 cream , which costs £ 285 for a three - month treatment , is applied to the hair daily			1
it is put into damp or dry hair using an applicator and then massaged into the scalp			2
the maker @entity55 , which developed it in its hair laboratory in @entity58 , claim that it is clinically proven to be effective for both men and women			1
root of the problem : scientists have found that many of those suffering from hair loss or balding have skin tissue in the scalp that has an oxygen deficiency a condition called hypoxia in a study , 101 people who used the product once a day for three months found a four per cent increase in the number of hairs they had , which represent an average of 1,700 new hairs			2
@entity81 , head of scientific affairs at @entity55 , said : ‘ we ’ve known for 100 years that hair grows and falls out			0
we have n’t known what makes hair regenerate until now			0
‘ it is all about hair stem cell environment			0
in 2000 , we have published the existence of two stem cell reservoirs in the hair and , more recently , we have both identified the optimal environment and designed a molecule able to favour it			0
‘ @entity48 is a result of this discovery that happens not very often			1
we have been able to develop a cosmetic product that respects the natural way hair regenerates			0
‘ a clinical trial has proven its efficacy on hair density - number and diameter			0
@entity21 will really help people who are experiencing thinning hair and less volume			0
’ @entity104 and @entity106 ambassador @entity105 added : ‘ it ’s set to be the holy grail for a lot of women – and men			1

@entity48 has gone on sale in hair salons this week
@entity116 claims that the treatment is effective for men and women
