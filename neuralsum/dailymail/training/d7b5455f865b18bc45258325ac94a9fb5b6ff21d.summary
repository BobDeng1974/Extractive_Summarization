a series of billboards in @entity2 erected to warn motorists entering the city of @entity5 , for decades known as one of the most notorious speed traps in @entity8 , are set to end after the ' corrupt ' police force was dissolved			1
until recently , @entity5 - described as the ' most corrupt town in @entity8 ' - had covered half of its $ 1 million budget by handing out an unusually high number of speeding ticket fines			1
the situation was so bad that in 2003 , the @entity17 had taken the unprecedented step of erecting billboards along @entity20 to warn motorists of the speed traps			1
a series of billboards erected by the @entity17 in @entity2 to warn motorists entering the city of @entity5 , for decades known as one of the most notorious speed traps in @entity8 , are set to end after the ' corrupt ' police force was dissolved earlier this month the nation 's leading advocate for traffic safety has said it is now reconsidering that need for the billboards after the city council voted earlier this month to dissolve the police force			1
in august , five officers came forward with allegations that police chief @entity40 enforced a ' strict ticket quota ' of 12 tickets for every 12 - hour shift			2
' looks like you have some work to do when you come in , ' @entity44 wrote in an email after an officer recorded only four tickets one day , according to the @entity50			0
@entity44 was suspended shortly after by city manager @entity51 after the @entity52 launched an investigation into another alleged violation of police procedure			0
until recently , @entity5 - described as the ' most corrupt town in @entity8 ' - had covered half of its $ 1 million budget by handing out an unusually high number of speeding ticket fines investigated : police chief @entity40 sent emails telling officers to follow an illegal quota for speeding tickets his replacement , @entity66 , stepped in , only to be hit with a @entity52 investigation and suspension of his own			1
both @entity66 and @entity44 resigned following their suspensions			0
patrols in the area are currently being handled by the @entity74 sheriff 's office and the @entity17 has said that it is watching the traffic situation in @entity5 closely			1
if traffic tickets are written to enhance safety rather than to meet a quota , the @entity17 has said it will consider ending its lease on the billboards			1
' assuming the disbanding results in the end of traffic enforcement taking place for the purpose of revenue generation , then we would strongly consider not renewing our billboards there , ' @entity81 , a public policy manager for the @entity17 , told @entity90			2
as a percentage of its city budget , no other municipality in @entity2 has relied on traffic citations as heavily as @entity5			2

' @entity17 condemns all practices whereby a law enforcement agency rates the efficiency of its officers based upon the number of arrests made or citations issued			0
' @entity5 had been one of two towns designated by the @entity17 as a ' traffic trap , ' meaning that it considered law enforcement practices to be more focused on generating revenue than enforcing safe driving behavior			2
the only other town in the country where the organization has taken the step of buying billboards that warn drivers of a trap ahead is in @entity134 , @entity2 , about 19 miles north of @entity5 along @entity20 .			1

the @entity17 has paid for billboards outside @entity5 , @entity2 , since 2003 to warn motorists about the city 's notorious speed traps
@entity141 voted 4 - 1 to dissolve the town 's ' corrupt ' police force last week
now the @entity17 has said it will reconsider the need for the billboards *provided* traffic tickets are now written to enhance safety rather than to meet a quota
