@entity0 , pictured , is a ' polymer hydrogel ' which is injected into the tube which sperm pass through to reach the penis , blocking it rather than cutting it as in a vasectomy men could be using long - lasting birth control - which does n’t involve condoms - within the next three years , according to a not - for - profit organisation			1
trials of a new male birth control injection , @entity14 , are showing promising results			2
developers hope the new drug will be cheap , reversible and long - lasting			1
@entity14 is a ' polymer hydrogel ' that is injected into the vas deferens - the tube that sperm passes through on the way to the penis			1
the gel acts to block sperm , thus preventing pregnancy			0
it is being developed by the @entity27 , a not - for - profit organisation who develop low - cost medical solutions			2
they said the procedure has the same effect as a vasectomy , but is less invasive as surgery is not required because the vas deferens is blocked with the gel , rather than cut			1
they hope the new contraceptive will be affordable , adding they want it to cost ' less than a flat screen tv '			1
during current trials on baboons , three males were injected with the @entity14 contraceptive			1
each baboon was then left living with 10 to 15 female baboons			0
after six months , no female baboons became pregnant , although the trial is not quite over			0
by the end of the year , the @entity27 said they will have a lot more information on whether @entity14 is effective			1
they added that if all goes well they will be planning for clinical trials with humans to start next year			2
it is also more reversible , they said			0
if a man wants his sperm unblocked , another polymer gel can be injected to flush out the @entity14 that is blocking the sperm			2
the product is based on another male contraceptive being developed , which is called @entity14			2
both @entity14 and @entity14 work on the principle of using a gel to block the vas deferens , but are formulated differently			1
while the @entity27 have not said how long a @entity14 injection would last as a contraceptive , a @entity14 injection is said to last 10 years			1
men could be using long - lasting and reversible contraceptive @entity14 within three years if clinical trials go well a spokesperson from the @entity27 said : ‘ we want to get @entity14 on the market as soon as possible , but all the proper efficacy and safety testing needs to be completed			1
‘ @entity14 is currently in animal testing , with human trials expected to start in early 2015and 2015 - 2016 ( larger trials )			2
' if everything goes well and with enough public support , we hope to get @entity14 on the market in 2016 - 2017			0
’ the @entity27 will be asking for public donations to fund the clinical trials on humans next year			1
another male contraceptive in early stages of development is the ‘ clean sheets ’ or ‘ dry orgasm ’ pill			0
this is a drug that could be taken before sex which leads to a semen - free orgasm			0
the orgasm feels the same but semen is not released			0
developers intend to design a drug which will take effect within a few hours of being ingested , which will wear off within 24 hours			0
a man could take this pill only as needed before having sex			0
researchers said this could also be effective in reducing the transmission of @entity110 from male to their partners			0
@entity115 researchers dr @entity113 and dr @entity116 are seeking partnership with a pharmaceutical company , which should speed the process of bringing a product to market .			0

@entity14 is a gel that is injected into the vas deferens as a contraceptive
@entity127 is the tube that sperm pass through on the way to the penis
the gel blocks the tube , meaning sperm can not be released
trials of the gel involving baboons have been promising
contraceptive is long - acting and reversible
developers @entity27 say there will be clinical trials next year
they want it to cost ' less than a flat screen tv '
