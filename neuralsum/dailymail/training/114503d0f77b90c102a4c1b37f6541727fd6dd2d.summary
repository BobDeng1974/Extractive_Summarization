by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail seven years ago @entity1 had high blood pressure , smoked 20 cigarettes a day and weighed 16 - and - a - half - stone after gorging on takeaway curries and chocolate			1
on saturday morning he will represent @entity6 in the marathon at the @entity8			1
way , who now weighs just 10st 8lbs , will not just be running to make up the numbers , either			0
going the distance : @entity1 will represent @entity6 in the marathon at the @entity8 in @entity13 the 40 - year - old was the third @entity17 man home in this year ’s @entity18 , crossing the line in 15th place , just eight minutes behind @entity21 , to earn his place at these games			1
not bad considering he had slept in a camper van on his cousin ’s drive the night before to save money			0
way , who works full - time in a bank in @entity29 , found himself shepherded towards the recovery area in @entity31 with the elite athletes after earning his largest cash prize to date , £ 896			1
he had to politely explain to stewards that his kit was with the mass participants			0
turnaround : @entity1 was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running his next target is to shave another 45 seconds off his personal best and break @entity44 ’s 1979 @entity17 record of 2hours 15.46secs , for runners aged 40 or over			1
it has been a quite extraordinary turnaround for a ‘ fat bloke ’ who decided to run the 2006 @entity18 ‘ on a whim ’ and ended up beating many younger , thinner , fitter club runners by clocking 3hrs 7mins 8secs			2
fighting fit : @entity1 now runs 130 miles per week such an impressive time did not prompt @entity1 to take up running properly			1
it was only 18 months later that he realised he needed to : not with any ambitions of joining the elite but for the good of his health			0
‘ towards the end of 2007 i could hardly sleep , ’ he told @entity58			0
‘ i was coughing and waking up because of the smoking and it was impacting on my wife @entity62 , too			0
‘ at that point half our meals were takeaways and i would eat chocolate and sweets all the time			0
i realised i had to do something radically different to break the cycle			2
’ way trained for the 2008 @entity18 for 24 weeks , finished in 2hrs 35mins and changed his lifestyle completely			1
he now runs around 130 miles a week — averaging 11 miles a day for the past seven years — and believes he could win gold in the 100km ( 62 - mile ) @entity75 in @entity76 in november if he can clock under 6hrs 20mins			1
he is a self - confessed ‘ running nerd ’ but still struggles to define himself as an elite athlete			2
there is clearly still disbelief that he found himself posing for pictures with sir @entity82 in the athletes ’ village in @entity13 and ‘ casually ‘ ‘ hanging out ’ ’ with the guys i ’m normally watching on the @entity88 circuit — even though i ’m old enough to be most of their dads ! ’			0
whatever happens during those 26.2miles around @entity13 tomorrow , @entity1 has certainly earned a celebratory takeaway , that ’s for sure .			2

@entity1 will race for @entity6 in the marathon at @entity96
way once weighed over 16st and smoked 20 cigarettes a day
he changed his lifestyle and now runs 130 miles a week
the 40 - year was the fourth man home at the @entity31 marathon
he is aiming to break @entity44 *'s* @entity17 record for runners aged over 40
