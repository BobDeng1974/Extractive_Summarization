by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 15:05 est , 18 june 2012 when members of the @entity4 generation die in the next 50 years , they will leave trillions of dollars in wealth behind , but their children should not hold their breath for a large inheritance			1
according to the @entity12 and @entity14 annual study released on monday , only 55 per cent of @entity4 - those between the ages of 47 to 66 - think it is important to leave money for their offspring			1
@entity12 commissioned an independent , national survey of 642 high net worth adults , who were not clients , with at least $ 3million in investable assets			0
givers : a study found that 31 per cent of wealthy @entity4 would prefer to leave their money to charity one of three @entity4 surveyed – about 31 per cent - do n’t think it is important to leave a financial inheritance and said they would rather leave money to charity than to their children			1
by contrast , three - quarters of wealthy people under age 46 said it 's a priority to leave inheritance for their children			1
the top reason for not wanting to leave money for their kids is the belief shared by some @entity4 that each subsequent generation should work to earn its own wealth			1
following closely behind is the thought that it is more important to invest in children ’s success while they are growing up			0
‘ our survey points to a shift in generational behavior and outlook , most likely shaped by personal experience and societal responses to economic realities , ’ said @entity53 , president of @entity12			0
banks added that well - off parents are concerned that the next generation is not prepared to inherit wealth , which is not surprising considering the fact that most of the @entity4 surveyed do n't talk to their kids about money : just 37 per cent said they 've fully disclosed their net worth to their children			1
kept in the dark : just 37 per cent of @entity4 said they 've fully disclosed their net worth to their kids those over age 67 said they were n't having this discussion because they were raised to avoid money talk , while younger respondents said they did n't want to inhibit their kids ' work ethic			1
unlike the majority of people from her generation , 63 - year - old @entity77 , of @entity78 , @entity79 , taught her two grown children since they were young to be responsible for their own money			2
that is why she plans to leave most of her money to her children and some money to charitable causes , @entity86 reported			2
one way @entity77 and her husband taught their children about responsible spending was providing the value of college tuition , room and board to each of them and putting them in charge of paying the bills			0
‘ people thought we were crazy , ’ she told @entity86			0
the @entity106 plan to start a college fund once their children start having their own kids			0
and they intend to add to it on their grandchildren ’s birthdays as long as @entity77 and her husband are alive			0
mrs @entity77 said she hopes her own children will do the same for their great - grandchildren			0
the @entity12 study also has found that 42 per cent of @entity4 and 54 per cent of those under age 46 are paying medical costs for their parents or other relatives .			2
