published : 05:00 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 05:19 est , 22 april 2013 targeted : scientists used @entity2 scanning to show that , when we 're looking for something , areas of the brain used for other mental tasks are redirected to help with the search the human brain can quickly mobilise a highly focused ' search party ' to track down a lost item , scientists claim			1
when people hunt for lost keys , a missing mobile phone , or a pet gone astray , their brain rapidly redirects areas normally dedicated to other mental tasks to help			1
according to researchers at the @entity23 , @entity23 , when we embark on a targeted search , various visual and non-visual regions of the brain shift their focus to track down the missing item			1
it means that , if we are looking for a child lost in a crowd , brain regions usually dedicated to recognising other objects - or even those associated with abstract thought - are reallocated to the task in hand , transforming the brain into a highly - focused child - finder			1
' our results show that our brains are much more dynamic than previously thought , rapidly reallocating resources based on behavioural demands , and optimising our performance by increasing the precision with which we can perform relevant tasks , ' said @entity47 , a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at @entity23 , and lead author of the study			0
' as you plan your day at work , for example , more of the brain is devoted to processing time , tasks , goals and rewards , and as you search for your cat , more of the brain becomes involved in recognition of animals , ' he said			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity65 , help to explain why we find it difficult to concentrate on more than one task at the same time			0
the results also shed light on how people are able to shift their attention to challenging tasks , and may provide greater insight into neurobehavioral and attention deficit disorders such as @entity74			2
lost something ? the results show our brains are much more dynamic than previously thought , scientists say the results were obtained via studies that used functional @entity2 ( @entity78 ) to record the brain activity of study participants as they searched for people or vehicles in movie clips			1
one experiment saw subjects hold down a button whenever a person appeared on screen , while in another , they did the same with vehicles			0
as they were doing so , the brain scans simultaneously measured neural activity via blood flow in thousands of locations across the brain			2
the scientists said the biggest changes they identified occurred in the prefrontal cortex - an area usually thought to be involved in abstract thought and long - term planning			0
researcher @entity47 researchers used regularized linear regression analysis , which finds correlations in data , to build models showing how each of the roughly 50,000 locations near the cortex responded to each of the 935 categories of objects and actions seen in the movie clips			1
next , they compared how much of the cortex was devoted to detecting humans or vehicles depending on whether or not each of those categories was the search target			0
they found that , when participants searched for humans , relatively more of the cortex was devoted to humans , and when they searched for vehicles , more of the cortex was devoted to vehicles			2
for example , areas usually involved in recognising specific visual categories such as plants or buildings switched to become tuned to humans or vehicles - vastly expanding the area of the brain engaged in the search			0
' these changes occur across many brain regions , not only those devoted to vision			2
in fact , the largest changes are seen in the prefrontal cortex , which is usually thought to be involved in abstract thought , long - term planning and other complex mental tasks , ' mr @entity47 said			1
the findings build on a previous @entity23 brain imaging study which revealed how the brain organises thousands of animate and inanimate objects into what researchers call a ' continuous semantic space '			0
those findings challenged previous assumptions that every visual category is represented in a separate region of the visual cortex			0
instead , researchers found that categories are actually represented in highly organised , continuous maps .			0

brain mobilises extra areas to help track down lost items , say scientists
redirects regions of the brain usually devoted to other mental tasks
