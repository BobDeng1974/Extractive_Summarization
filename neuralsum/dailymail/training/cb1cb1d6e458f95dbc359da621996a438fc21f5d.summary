parents are being warned of a cancer - scare involving fake accessories for loom bands after tests revealed some imported batches were laced with deadly levels of chemicals			1
safety officials have issued the stark message after intercepting rogue consignments of the bands and plastic trinkets sold with them which were headed for @entity14 shelves from the @entity15			1
scientists carried out rigorous tests on several loom band ' charms ' , accessories attached to necklaces and bracelets made from the colourful elastic bands , and each one was found to have dangerous levels of phthalates in them			1
the legal limit for phthalates is 0.1 per cent by weight of the plasticised material in toys and childcare articles			1
sixteen packets of the charms that came in cheaper , ' unofficial ' box sets of loom bands - the latest playground craze - were randomly tested from bigger batches which had arrived into the @entity14 from manufacturers in the @entity15			1
they had either been sent for testing by responsible import companies or intercepted by @entity59 on their way to high street shops			2
all of the 16 packets of charms tested contained more than the accepted 0.1 per cent level - with two having more than 50 per cent			1
the batches they came from could not be issued with safety certificates which meant they could not be distributed to high street stores			1
safety officials are now urging parents to be vigilant when buying loom bands and charms , with the advice to only buy packets with the ' @entity76 ' safety mark from reputable retailers			1
importers and retailers are also being encouraged to send their loom band charms to them for testing if they have n't already done so			1
the @entity82 , an independent company which tests the safety of toys , carried out the investigation			2
it provides importers and retailers with test reports confirming whether a product has passed or failed			0
phthalates are used as a softener in @entity94 and can be found on textiles , coated leather and more commonly plastic - type articles			1
they can migrate from plastic into the body if it comes into contact with saliva or sweat			2
@entity105 , from the @entity82 , said : ' the problem we found was not with the bands but with the charms that are sold with them			1
' out of the 16 packets we tested every single charm failed because of the high levels of phthalates in them			1
loom bands have soared in popularity in recent months and have been sported by the likes of prince @entity120 ' it 's not to say every packet of loom bands out there is affected but there are plenty of products on the market that could be dangerous			1
' we rely on manufacturers coming to us to get their products tested and many of the major retailers will only agree to stock products that are certified by our laboratories			1
' the worrying thing is the charms are the bits that are most likely to end up in children 's mouths			2
' loom bands are the big craze at the moment and they are flooding into the country from all over the world			2
' we have no idea how many of them are being tested and how many are going into circulation containing dangerous substances			1
' we do n't want to be seen to be scaremongering but we are here to protect customers so when something like this comes up we need to raise awareness of it			0
' we would urge importers not to take any risks			0
send products to our laboratory for testing and protect people 's health and your reputation			2
' mother - of - two @entity165 said she was horrified by the news and would now stop her children @entity168 , five , and @entity170 , three , from playing with loom bands			2
mrs @entity165 , 36 , who runs the parenting website @entity172 , said : ' it is extremely worrying news			0
loom bands are the latest craze and children want to play with them but people really need to know about their risks			2
' if they are dangerous then they do not belong in the home			2
i certainly wo n't be buying any more for my children and i will be alerting other parents of this potential danger			0
' in light of these tests i would advise parents to find something else to entertain their children			2
there are lots of other toys on the market that are safe to play with			2
' the discovery has also prompted concerns from @entity59 , which is struggling to police the millions of packets of loom bands flooding into the @entity14 as the craze continues			1
@entity201 , a lead officer for product safety at the @entity203 , said : ' the regulated level for phthalates in the @entity14 is fixed at 0.1 per cent			1
' when it comes to the risks they pose , it 's a question of how long you are exposed to them			0
' if you touched and played with a toy with phthalates in for 10 minutes , it probably would n't be a problem at all			2
' but kids make these loom bands into bracelets and wear them for long periods so often there is direct skin contact 24 hours a day for several weeks			1
' children 's skin also absorbs toxins more easily than adults			0
phthalates are carcinogenic , mutagenic and cause reproductive problems			0
' we do n't know the true extent of the problem			0
tests are being done on the precautionary principle but we have no idea what is already out there			0
' @entity237 bands and their charms are very cheap to make			1
they are flooding into @entity14 in their millions and and it is very hard to keep tabs on them			1
' with the chemicals in them , the first thing you might know about it is when you start seeing birth defects 20 years down the line when children have kiddies themselves			0
' i would warn parents to be vigilant about loom bands - only buy from respected shops , not off market stalls , and look for a @entity14 distributor 's address on the packing as well as a ce mark			1
' do n't allow your children to put them in their mouths			0
' loom bands are largely made in @entity263 , the @entity15 , @entity264 and @entity265			1
the new craze - where children spend hours twisting the colourful rubber bands into bracelets and jewellery - is popular around the world			0
looms bands are simple , colourful , rubber bands which are weaved together to make friendship bracelets			0
they were invented in the @entity276 last year by father - of - two @entity277			0
since then , his company , @entity279 , has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom , crochet hook and bands – worldwide			1
the latest fashion accessory and playground craze has been seen on the arm of a number of celebrities including presenter @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity293 's @entity292 and pop star @entity294			0
even the @entity295 and @entity296 have been spotted sporting the sought - after arm candy			0
in recent weeks , sales of loom bands have gone through the roof and they now occupy the majority of spots in @entity304 's current best - selling toy chart			0

' we began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the @entity296 was seen wearing one , they have been flying off our shelves			0
' however , in light of the craze , medical professionals have raised concerns about the safety of the bands			0
it comes after a number of children were harmed playing with genuine loom bands , including one boy who nearly lost two fingers after the bands wrapped tightly around them and another who was left blinded when one hit him in the eye			2
last month , dr @entity343 - @entity342 , chair of @entity344 and @entity345 , warned of the dangers			0
she said : ' kids obviously love playing with them but having seen the article that has hit the press , where a child had fallen asleep with some wrapped round his fingers , i would just urge parents to be vigilant			0
' they could be a choking hazard or cause circulatory problems if children swallow or wrap them round their fingers for any length of time			0
' while genuine loom bands contain acceptable levels of phthalates – which is 0.1 per cent by weight in the @entity14 and @entity276 – several counterfeit products , predominantly charms to attach to the bands , have emerged with far higher levels of the chemicals			1
tests by the @entity370 in @entity82 found some batches of charms heading for @entity14 shelves contained as much as 50 per cent of phthalates			1
the rise of counterfeits has even prompted @entity279 to issue a warning about fake products			0
the firm which started the craze said : tthere are many fake / counterfeit @entity381 products available online and at stores			0
' some fake products possess the same name as genuine @entity381 products but these counterfeit products are unsafe for children and have not been tested in accordance with @entity276 toy safety standards ( may contain lead and other dangerous substances )			1
' it also warned that products could be of inferior in quality			0
there are fears the products – including those intercepted and tested by the @entity370 in @entity82 – are being imported to the @entity14 from the @entity15 .			1
