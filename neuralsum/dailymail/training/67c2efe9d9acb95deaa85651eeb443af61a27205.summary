by @entity0 an @entity2 man suffering from a facial deformity lives in constant pain after giving up on ever having surgery to remove his 9lbs ‘ trunk ’			1
@entity7 , 35 , can not eat or talk properly because of the tumour which has grown from his face down to his chest			1
mr @entity12 , who lives in a remote village just outside @entity14 , in @entity15 , northern @entity2 , avoids mirrors and lives alone , supported by his two nieces			1
mr @entity12 has attempted surgery in the past , most recently ten years ago , but nearly bled to death and doctors told him to never try it again if he wanted to live			1
mr @entity12 , the youngest of eight siblings , lives as a recluse , and gets through his day - to - day chores with the help of two of his nieces			1
he said : ‘ i have an ugly face ; i do n’t even like looking at myself in the mirror so i do n't expect anyone else to look at me either			1
‘ i would love to have surgery but i have lost all hope			1
i almost died last time i had surgery so i doubt anything can be done to this face			1
’ the elephant man : mr @entity12 's parents were offered money to display him during shows when he was a child , but they refused only family : mr @entity12 lives as a recluse in the village , but is helped with his day to day activities by two of his nieces mr @entity12 was born with a very small blemish on his face at his home in the village where he still resides , but with his parents very poor , and no doctors or hospitals nearby , he did not see a medial professional until he was eight			1
‘ i knew there was something strange about my face when children would run away from me , ’ he said			1
‘ i remember crying to my mother and she told me directly that i had a scary face			1
after that i never asked anyone to play with me again			1
' that year , his late parents took him to a doctor , but the 15,000 rupee ( £ 148 ) fee for treatment was too expensive for the family and they went home			2
mr @entity12 ’s parents were even offered money by a travelling circus to showcase him , but they refused			2
he returned to the doctor at the age of 25 after his family finally raised enough money for surgery			2
during surgery , doctors cut into a main blood vessel and mr @entity12 started bleeding uncontrollably			2
he says the doctors advised his parents if they wanted him to live he should never have another operation			2
constant pain : mr @entity12 can no longer chew or talk properly and has lost the sight in his left eye and ca n't hear through his left ear no going back : what was once a small facial deformity has now grown into a 9lbs ' trunk ' the tumour has now grown so large that mr @entity12 has lost his eyesight in his left eye and hearing in his left ear			1
‘ i ca n’t even chew because my jaw has dropped and my teeth ca n’t do their job			2
i ’d love to know what it ’s like to bite into a juicy apple , he says			2
although he takes work as a labourer on building sites when he can , manual work is often painful			2
‘ i ’m in agony			2
my head hurts when i have to carry heavy things but i do n’t complain ; the boss would n’t give me work if he heard me moan			0
’ mr @entity12 lives alone but is looked after by his niece @entity111			1
she has tried to find her uncle a wife			0
ms @entity115 , 25 , said : ‘ i feel very sad for my uncle when i think of him alone			0
' i want him to have a normal life like all my other uncles			0
when i was younger i used to be scared of him but i ’ve got used to his face now			0
he ’s a softly spoken caring man ; i ’ve never seen him get angry			0
‘ we ’re trying to find him a wife , but families turn away when they see his condition			0
i want a woman to love my uncle for who he is			0
’ trying hard : although he picks up work when he can , mr @entity12 says it is painful to work with the tumour no hope : mr @entity12 's family managed to raise money for him to have surgery ten years ago , but after doctors failed to stem bleeding during the operation , they told his parents he could never be helped the ' original ' elephant man , @entity138 , who lived in the late 1800s mr @entity12 on the other hand has lost hope , saying he would like to get married and have children but that ‘ fathers think their daughters are going to catch my disease			0
’ ‘ they think it ’s contagious and they quickly leave because they ’re scared			0
’ when he travels outside his village people are amazed by his facial deformity and think he is an incarnation of the @entity153 elephant @entity154			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ people touch my feet and ask me to pray for them because they say i have the face of a god			0
but they anger me ; of course i ’m not a god			0
i would n’t be in this much pain and misery if i was a god			0
’ ‘ i would love to get rid of this ugly face			0
if a doctor out there thinks they can do something i ’d have no issues			0
’ dr @entity170 , 34 , a general surgeon at @entity171 , in @entity14 , said : ‘ this is a severe case of neurofibromatosis type i. the tumour has completely deformed his facial structure			1
' if this disease continues to progress he might develop ulcerations and infectious complications			0
he will not die from this condition but the consequences of having such a big tumour might eventually kill him			0

his illness has seen a once small facial deformity grow into a 9lbs ' trunk '
