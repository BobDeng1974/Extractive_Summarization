@entity9 , 51 , was hired as director of partner engagement at @entity4 in march 2013 after a thorough vetting			1
she had n't yet been indicted in the case , which stemmed from her tenure at the helm of @entity19 of @entity20 , a federal contractor			2
in 2007 the @entity1 @entity21 gave the organization a $ 514,454 grant , which @entity9 managed , to build 22 homes in rural areas			1
charges were brought on january 16 , and she pleaded not guilty in federal court on february 6 , answering eight charges of theft and fraud from the nonprofit housing agency			1
a top program director with @entity34 's @entity6 insurance exchange is facing 20 years in prison for defrauding the housing agency where she last worked president @entity38 's re-election campaign was met in september by cheering @entity34 throngs , just as @entity4 was beginning a search that would culminate in @entity9 's hiring it was n't until monday that she notified @entity4 , which promptly placed her on administrative leave , according to the @entity47			1
@entity9 is free pending trial in june			1
her charges could bring between five and 20 years in prison plus a fine of $ 250,000			1
her @entity53 - based employer told the @entity47 that she seemed perfect for the $ 130,000 job , since she had worked before with @entity56 officials and both state and federal agencies			2
spokesman @entity59 said in a statement wednesday that ' integrity and public trust are paramount to the mission of @entity4			2
we take extensive measures to protect consumer information and technology systems			0
' his organization is on full alert now , scrambling to explain itself to @entity72			0
the charges against her are ' very serious , and we are taking this very seriously , ' said @entity59			0
a center - right advocacy group in @entity53 also sees the integrity lapse as no small thing			0
' @entity72 deserve better than someone who has been accused of fraud and theft running critical components of the state health care exchange , ' said @entity84 , executive director of @entity85			0
' this is very serious			0
@entity72 have every right to be extremely concerned about these allegations			0
' @entity34 's enrollment in @entity6 has reportedly been a mixed bag , with urbanites flocking to sign up but ranchers and mountain - dwellers becoming increasingly skeptical @entity34 's @entity6 exchange is busily signing up new insurance customers , but the organization 's connections with federal @entity56 overseers and other officials will get a hard look after @entity9 's departure the embarrassing lapse in human - resources quality control is just the latest in a string of health insurance disappointments for the @entity38 administration			1
some state - level marketplaces , such as those in @entity109 and @entity110 , have performed more or less as they were designed to			0
but others have been plagued with self - inflicted wounds as damaging as the one that made the @entity38 administration 's healthcare.gov a national punchline			0
@entity120 's website , for instance , has yet to function properly			0
now the federal government will likely have to question @entity4 @entity34 's accounting , and the architecture of its data processing , since so many millions of dollars are at stake			1
federal contractors told @entity127 that the @entity128 would likely have to commission an audit of the organization 's finances			2
that could take a long time and leave in limbo the organization 's ability to interface with federal government agencies including the @entity138			1
political analyst @entity139 told the @entity47 that the entire episode ' simply contributes to the fact that the overall implementation of health - insurance reform has been troubled by an endless series of embarrassments			0
' news of @entity148 's charges came as the latest in a series of @entity151 hiccups , including nationwide attention last year focused on an enrollment campaign showing college students doing keg stands and getting drunk @entity9 's federal indictment , published online by the @entity158 , alleges that between 2008 and 2010 she put ' significant sums ' of money in her own pocket for consulting services that she was ineligible to bill for , since her executive director position was already a full - time job			2
she also steered money to family and friends for nonexistent work , federal prosecutors say , bought herself a personal laptop computer with federal funds , and cut herself an unauthorized check for $ 21,000 from the housing agency			1
perhaps more original was @entity9 's alleged scheme to charge home buyers $ 750 for a nonexistent warranty , and $ 1,000 for renting tools that the federal government 's grant provided			1
she steered that money , the government says , into a separate bank account over which she had more complete control			0
@entity9 's name is still listed as a staffer on @entity4 @entity34 's website			2
she did not respond for requests for comment .			0

@entity9 , 51 , is charged with stealing tens of *thousands* of dollars from a nonprofit housing agency she ran in @entity11
the federal government indicted her last month because the agency ran on government grants from the @entity1 @entity21
@entity9 never told @entity4 , the state 's @entity6 insurance exchange , about her pending legal troubles
