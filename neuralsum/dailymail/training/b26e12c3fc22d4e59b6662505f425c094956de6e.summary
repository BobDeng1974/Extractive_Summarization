signals from the black box of @entity2 were detected thursday near where the plane 's partly submerged tail was located , but the signals were lost soon after			1
an @entity8 armed forces commander said that a recovery of the tail , where the flight recorders are typically located , is in progress			1
the black box or flight data recorder could help determine the cause of the crash , however it only has 30 days of battery life			1
it comes as news that the families of the victims of @entity2 flight @entity23 will be offered $ us100 , 000 in compensation by the airline as those searching for the plane claim they are just hours away from finding the plane 's black box			1
it follows an offer of $ us24 , 000 after family members were given a draft letter from @entity2 , which detailed its initial compensation deal , @entity30 reported			1
@entity56 , commander of @entity8 's navy rescue team , told @entity58 they are planning to send two contingents to the plane			2
' we are going to send down one observation team to take photos			0
then two teams will do the recovery process -- to recover bodies if there are any , ' he said			2
' if not , they will recover the black box for investigation and then other debris from the aircraft , ‚Äù there were 162 people on board the flight , so far only 40 bodies have been recovered with more expected to be found in the plane 's fuselage which lies at the bottom of the sea , off the coast of the @entity8 island of @entity85			1
of the 162 people on board , 155 were passengers while others were pilots and crew members			0
no survivors have been recovered since the search for the plane began 11 days ago			2
family members have been left confused about the letter 's wording and raising issue with the airline approaching families separately in relation to compensation , the @entity94 reported			1
but @entity2 's director of safety and security defended the isolated discussions to @entity107 on tuesday , saying : ' we respect that [ some ] families are still hoping to see that their relatives survived , so we offered [ compensation first ] to those whose family members have been identified '			1
so far 40 bodies have been recovered from the @entity112			1
families of victims have been offered compensation they have been offered $ us100 , 000 after they were initially offered $ us24 , 000 by the airline captain @entity116 added the airlines would be compensating families in line with @entity8 policy			1
according to the regulatory body that is responsible for @entity8 's finance sector , agencies that insure airlines were liable to give 1.25 billion rupiah for every one of the 155 passengers including 315 million rupiah to 750 million rupiah for the 25 passengers who bought flight insurance			2
this news comes as searchers are hopeful they will recover the plane 's black box on thursday after finding the aircraft 's tail the day before			1
bad weather conditions have hampered the search , which has prevented divers from confirming the object in the water is in fact the tail , according to the @entity145 - based news website			0
it is thought the black box and voice recorders were inside the end of the plane			1
the search area for bodies and debris was expanded this week to allow for the strong currents that have been pushing debris around , @entity8 search and rescue operation coordinator @entity151 said			0
on wednesday , searchers looking for the plane say they believe they have found the aircraft 's tail along with the tail , the fuselage is thought to be with it , off the coast of the @entity8 island of @entity85 the black box is thought to be inside the tail			1
it will help shed some light on the last moments of the flight before it crashed the water in the @entity112 is relatively shallow , about 30 meters deep , but this is the worst time of year for a recovery operation because of monsoon rains and wind that create choppy seas and blinding silt from river run - off			2
but in some ways , it is easier to find a missing plane compared to the extreme depths of the @entity183 , where searchers continue to hunt for @entity185 , which disappeared last march with 239 people aboard			2
' because the @entity112 is such an enclosed basin , and there 's not really big currents passing through it , everything just stays there for quite a while and the waves make it so that the sediment does n't slowly sink to the bottom , ' @entity187 , an oceanographer at @entity189 's @entity188 , said			0
' it continuously keeps churning it up			0
' dr van @entity187 said the conditions also make it particularly dangerous for divers because the water is dark and murky , making it easy for them to cut themselves on jagged wreckage or become snared and trapped			0
during the dry season , he added , it would likely be easy to see the plane underwater from the sky			0
searchers remain hopeful the recovery of the tail would happen sometime on thursday @entity217 and @entity216 display recovered seats from the @entity219 on tuesday @entity221 personnel carry wrecked seats from the @entity2 plane to land @entity226 and @entity225 carries remains of seats from the @entity229 at @entity230 on january 6 as the cause of the incident remains a mystery , the find would shed light on what happened during the final moments of the @entity23 flight			1
but the @entity8 meteorological agency said weather was the ' triggering factor ' of the crash in the @entity112 , with ice likely damaging the engines of the @entity245			0
coordinating minister for maritime affairs @entity246 told reporters the black box would be analysed by experts in @entity8 when it was located			1
it will provide essential information about the plane along with final conversations between the captain and co-pilot			0
the ping - emitting beacons still have about 20 days before their batteries go dead , but high waves had prevented the deployment of ships that drag ' ping ' locators			0
sonar - equipped ships involved in the massive international hunt have identified what they believe to be the fuselage of the plane in recent days			0
five other big objects have been found on the floor of the ocean , though no visual confirmation has been obtained yet five other big objects have been found on the floor of the ocean , though no visual confirmation has been obtained yet			0
smaller pieces of the plane , such as seats and an emergency door , have been collected from the surface			0
@entity280 , @entity2 's chief executive officer , welcomed the news			2
if it is the right part of the tail section , he tweeted , then the cockpit voice and flight data recorders , or black boxes , ' should be there '			1
he said the airline 's priority still is to recover all the bodies ' to ease the pain of our families '			2
one released image appeared to show an upside down ' a '' painted on a piece of metal , while another grainy shot depicted some mechanical parts			0
so far , 40 corpses have been found , including an additional one announced wednesday , but time is running out			2
at two weeks , most corpses will sink , said @entity303 , head of @entity8 's disaster identification victim unit , and there are already signs of serious decomposition			0
officials are hopeful many of the more than 122 bodies still unaccounted for will be found inside the fuselage , which is believed to be lying near the tail			1
just before losing contact , the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds , but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic			0
no distress signal was issued .			0
