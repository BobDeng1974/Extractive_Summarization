@entity2 faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend @entity34 , whom he shot and killed at his home in @entity36 on @entity38 last year chief prosecutor @entity292 says the prosecution will file closing arguments on july 30 and the defence will do so on august 4			1

mr @entity292 said the defense witness , physician @entity313 , could not be objective about the double - amputee runner			2
the defence maintains that @entity2 has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime , and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house			1
under questioning , @entity313 acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a ' forensic report ' but disputed mr @entity292 's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with @entity2 , having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively .			1
