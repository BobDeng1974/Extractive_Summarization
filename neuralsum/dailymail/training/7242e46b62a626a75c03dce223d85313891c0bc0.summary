by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson if it ’s not broken , do n’t fix it - then again if you have £ 60million to spend , why not ? on tuesday , @entity4 added @entity5 to an abundance of attacking talent that includes @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
last season they won the @entity13 , breaking the record for goals scored , now manager @entity16 has the enviable task of finding room for the winner of the @entity20 at the @entity21			0
reach for the stars : @entity5 is the final piece in the most expensive team in world football two become three : @entity9 and @entity8 will have to make room for one more superstar in the @entity28 expensive : £ 86m @entity9 @entity29 : £ 60m @entity5 pricey : £ 80m @entity8 signed : @entity5 was unveiled as a @entity4 player on tuesday at the @entity31 hands in the air : @entity5 acknowledges the crowd at the @entity31 as he is unveiled as a @entity4 player @entity36 inspired by @entity37 and shows off his skill competition : @entity9 sprints in training in @entity41 as @entity5 is unveiled in @entity4 eye on the ball : @entity9 does kick - ups during training as @entity16 issues instructions to his team stars : @entity8 is just one of a host of talented players who will make up the @entity4 side galacticos : @entity8 being unveiled back in 2009 in front of tens of thousands of @entity4 fans the @entity55 scored six goals in five games in @entity57 , declared an immediate preference for @entity4 over @entity59 and having just turned 23 , he has his best years ahead of him			1
as galacticos go , he ticks all the boxes			0
thousands of supporters packed into the @entity31 on tuesday evening to welcome the former @entity64 midfielder , who has signed for six years and will earn about £ 110,000 - a - week			1
for @entity4 , signing the @entity66 - managed player and dealing with @entity64 owner @entity67 has been far easier than @entity69 ’s chairman @entity68 , who made them sweat until the end of last august for the services of @entity9			0
real president @entity73 addressed supporters in the @entity31 and had his name chanted as if he were another of the club ’s cast of superstars			0
the rest of football was left asking how real manage the annual outlay and how @entity16 will now manage to keep all his players happy			0
the answer to both questions will , in part , be in the sale of players			0
just as last year the transfer of @entity89 to @entity90 and @entity91 to @entity92 helped finance the capture of @entity9 , so this year @entity94 , @entity95 and , if the right offer arrives , @entity96 , will help pay for the new arrivals			2
incoming @entity100 goalkeeper @entity99 will require the departure of @entity102 or @entity103			2
dream team : new acquisition @entity105 will make part of the £ 375million @entity37 side delighted : @entity4 president @entity73 unveils @entity105 following his move @entity4 : @entity10 signed from @entity111 in 2009 and he too is part of the £ 375m dream team skills : @entity5 showed played up to the crowd with some flicks and tricks out on the pitch arrival : @entity5 poses with a ball during his presentation on the pitch at the @entity31 money raised in the transfer market , along with @entity4 ’s shared stranglehold over @entity127 television revenue with @entity59 , has long helped keep them on top of football ’s rich list , although before the arrival of @entity16 they were unable to convert that dominance into @entity135 trophies			1
now the @entity136 , who in @entity138 last season guided them to their first @entity13 in 11 years , will have to accommodate @entity5 , who operates best as the no 10 in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			0
if @entity16 opts for that system , the new boy will be flanked by @entity8 and @entity9 behind @entity10 in attack , and @entity145 or @entity146 will partner last week ’s £ 24m signing @entity105 in midfield			1
@entity16 is the master pragmatist and could also play 4 - 4 - 2 with a diamond midfield that has @entity5 at the top and @entity145 at the base with @entity146 and @entity105 either side and @entity9 and @entity8 up - front at the expense of @entity10			1
neither system accommodates @entity95 , @entity94 or @entity96 , who must now be wishing he had followed his former boss @entity157 to @entity158 last summer instead of moving to @entity4			2
unveiled : @entity4 president @entity73 ( left ) presents @entity5 ( right ) at the @entity31			2

@entity5 signed for @entity4 for £ 60million on tuesday
he has agreed a six - year deal worth £ 110,000 - a - week
the *playmaker* was unveiled to @entity4 *'s* fans at the @entity31
he joins @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity105 , @entity10 in a team worth £ 375m
manager @entity16 must accommodate all these stars into a team
@entity95 , @entity94 and *possibly* @entity96 will be sold as a result
@entity100 goalkeeper @entity99 is also expected to sign soon
