by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 1 may 2013 a financial - style ' happiness index ' that measures the mood of the world has revealed the day of the @entity4 was the saddest online for five years			1
the site shows a graph that rises and falls , in much the same way as the @entity9			0
but the peaks and troughs have nothing to do with the financial health of major companies - they represent the averaged out emotional state of tens of millions of people			0
a dramatic hedonometer dip can be seen on monday , april 15 , the day of the @entity4 - showing how shock waves from such events resonate around the world			1
in fact , april 15 , 2013 , turns out to be the saddest day since the scientists started gathering their data five years ago the key words tweeted on the day of the @entity26 bombings 50 million tweets from around the world are collected each day and analysed for ' happy ' , ' sad ' and ' neutral ' word content			1
words are assigned scores with the happiest and most positive placed at the top of a 1 - 9 scale			0
from this , an average happiness rating is calculated and plotted on the global map			0
a team of @entity39 scientists constructed the hedonometer from data obtained from the social messaging site @entity43			0
some 50 million tweets from around the world are collected each day and analysed for ' happy ' , ' sad ' and ' neutral ' word content			1
words are assigned scores with the happiest and most positive placed at the top of a 1 - 9 scale			0
from this , an average happiness rating is calculated and plotted			0
' reporters , policymakers , academics - anyone - can come to the site and see population - level responses to major events , ' said dr @entity57 , from the @entity58 , one of two @entity39 mathematicians who developed the hedonometer			0
the team hit the headlines in february after revealing @entity64 , in the heart of @entity67 's wine - growing region , to be the happiest city in the @entity39			0
but the global website , providing a way to gauge the happiness of the world , only went public @entity74 dramatic hedonometer dip can be seen on monday , april 15 , the day of the @entity4 - showing how shock waves from such events resonate around the world			1
in fact , april 15 , 2013 , turns out to be the saddest day since the scientists started gathering their data five years ago			1
' many of the articles written in response to the bombing have quoted individual tweets reflecting qualitative micro-stories , ' said dr @entity57			1
' our instrument reflects a kind of quantitative macro-story , one that journalists can use to bring big data into an article attempting to characterise the public response to the incident			0
' the hedonometer is based on a psychological assessment of around 10,000 words			0
runners continue to run towards the finish line of the @entity103 as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race , as runners tweeted images around the world investigators look for evidence on @entity112 at the scene of the @entity103 bombings in @entity26 , @entity115 , @entity39			1
researchers said the day the bombing was the saddest moment online for five years paid volunteers rated the words for their ' emotional temperature ' , ranking the happiest at the top of the scale and the saddest at the bottom			1
averaging the volunteers ' responses , the scientists assigned an overall score to each word			1
the word " happy " itself scored 8.30 , ' hahaha ' 7.94 , ' cherry ' 7.04 and the more neutral ' pancake ' 6.96			1
the words ' and ' and ' the ' scored a truly neutral 5.22 and 4.98			1
at the bottom of the scale , the word ' crash ' scored 2.60 , ' war ' 1.80 and ' jail ' 1.76			1
trending words such as ' explosion ' , ' victims ' and ' kill ' pushed the hedonometer down to its lowest ever level on april 15			0
positively scored words such as ' prayers ' and ' families ' also spiked that day - but not for positive reasons			2
' if we remove ' prayers ' , ' love ' , and ' families ' it 's not going to change the day 's overall deviation from the background because of all the other words , " said dr @entity57			2
the most recent global happiness map - which is updated every 24 hours currently the hedonometer is updated every 24 hours , but further development could see billions of words collected daily to provide a minute - by - minute barometer of global happiness			2
the team is also trying to expand beyond ' atoms ' of single words to ' molecules ' of two - word expressions			2
' it 's the relative context that is so important , which is why the sudden drop from the @entity103 bombings jumps out at you , ' said @entity174 , a hedonometer researcher from the @entity176 , a @entity39 big - data not - for - profit organisation			1
' the hedonometer shows the pulse of a society			0
' the scientists acknowledge that happiness is a slippery word that means different things to different people			2
' we 're not trying to tell you that contentment is better than happiness - we 're not trying to define the word , " said dr @entity57			2
' we 're just saying we 're measuring something important and interesting			0
' and , now , sharing it with the world			2

50 million tweets from around the world are collected each day and analysed
system looks for ' happy ' , ' sad ' and ' neutral ' word content
