by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 11 december 2012 a village green in a @entity3 beauty spot has been partly replaced with artificial turf after the grass was being ruined by crowds of tourists			1
a 100sq ft patch of public land between a path and the @entity11 in the picture postcard @entity14 village of @entity15 on the @entity16 was dug up and replaced with imitation grass			1
councillors in the village , known as the ' @entity20 ' , voted to approve the scheme in september after spending Â£ 1,000 each year repairing grass which had been trampled by hordes of visitors			1
popular spot for sightseers : this patch of grass was often left threadbare by tourists jostling to take pictures this is the view they 're after : locals say photographers like to stand in this spot to capture the pretty bridges they considered several different areas in which to trial the long - lasting fake grass before choosing one small patch most popular with sightseers photographing the river where it is crossed by several attractive low bridges			1
@entity45 , chairman of @entity46 , said the patch had been looking ' threadbare ' before the work			2
he said : ' i think it 's a very good selection for a particularly problematic area			2
' the feedback we 've had so far has been very positive			0
the fact people have been walking past without noticing it is artificial is excellent			0
' i think it 's blended in remarkably well			0
we will just wait and see how the trial period progresses before we make a decision about other problem areas			0
' the installed turf , made by @entity61 , won a gold medal at the @entity64 @entity63 earlier this year			0
no need for mowing : bourton on the @entity16 's grass should last for a decade , despite the hordes of sightsteers close up : the imitation grass is designed to look as real as possible , complete with paler ' dying ' grass it is hoped it will help the council cut down on repair costs as it is expected to last for 10 years before it needs replacing			1
but @entity76 , chief executive of @entity77 , was not so enthusiastic about the new grass			2
he said : ' i hope they assessed the impact on wildlife because i ca n't imagine that the beetles and the birds are going to enjoy foraging around among nylon turf very much			2
' @entity15 on the @entity16 is known for its pretty @entity87 and wide greens , as well as its model village that dates back to the 1930s			1
other local attractions include @entity91 , the @entity92 , and a model railway			0
beauty spot : the river @entity11 passes through some of the most beautiful places in the @entity98 , including @entity99 and @entity100 , where it was used in the manufacture of the famous @entity100 blankets			0

the grass in @entity15 on the water was being left threadbare by tourists
councillors hope they will save money with long - lasting imitation grass
