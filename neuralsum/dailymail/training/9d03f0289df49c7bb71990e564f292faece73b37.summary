@entity1 - winning jockey @entity0 has somehow been invited back on to the same @entity3 preview panel on which he made a vile racist comment			1
@entity0 was fined £ 1,500 by the @entity5 , axed as a @entity7 racecourse host and interviewed under caution by @entity9 after inexcusably telling an audience of 140 punters at famous racing pub , the @entity13 that ‘ there are no n * * * * * s in here because @entity18 ( the owner ) does n’t allow them in			1
’ minister of sport @entity20 called his remark ‘ horrific ’			0
jockey @entity0 has been invited on to the @entity3 preview panel despite his racist comment @entity0 , assistant trainer for @entity26 , apologised and after his @entity5 disciplinary he said : ‘ i ’m very aware that any success i ’ve had in racing brings with it responsibility			1
on that evening i failed to live up to that responsibility			0
’ yet despite the huge sensitivity around racism in sport , the @entity32 is staging its @entity37 event with exactly the same cast list as last year — including @entity0			1
the decision will exasperate those trying to change racing ’s often insular attitude but pub owner @entity43 said : ‘ it ’s entirely appropriate @entity0 is on the panel			1
he has paid his dues so why should n’t i employ him			0
’ a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ this issue was dealt with at the time			1
we can not tell the @entity32 how to conduct their business			0
’ @entity52 , the only @entity54 muslim on the snooker circuit , was wearing a waistcoat logo badge bearing the initials @entity58 in his match against @entity60 in the @entity61 , causing a furore on social media			0
@entity52 explained that accountants @entity65 - rather than an @entity67 terror organisation - had been his personal sponsors for 14 years			2
@entity52 caused a social media furore with the initials of his sponsor reading @entity58 at the @entity61 @entity52 clarified that the badge referred to ' @entity65 ' - his long - term sponsors @entity75 ’s relationship with sir @entity76 has thawed somewhat since the infamous boot - in - the - face incident was followed by his transfer to @entity79			1
still , it was a surprise to see the pair separated only by @entity75 ’s spokesman @entity82 at the @entity83 as they watched @entity85 draw with @entity86			1
the seating plan was said to be concidence			0
@entity76 was in @entity89 on holiday with his wife , while @entity75 played briefly for @entity86 before his retirement			1

@entity98 has had a more successful time as commercial director for the inauguaral @entity103 in @entity104 2015 , but is leaving before a @entity54 broadcasting deal is signed and what will be a difficult ticket sale process			0
meanwhile well - travelled former @entity109 and @entity110 communications chief @entity108 is expected to take up the same role in @entity104			2
@entity98 has been appointed a chief commericial officer at @entity94 @entity113 swerves race row @entity113 ’s advisers have switched thursday ’s launch of his @entity118 presidential campaign manifesto from @entity119 to @entity120 to avoid the furore over @entity85 fans ’ racist behaviour overshadowing the event			1
@entity113 has been vocal about racism issues in the past , calling it ‘ not a football problem , but a wider social ill ’			0
going to the national stadium could be awkward as the @entity130 are supporting @entity131 of @entity132			0
but the prince has no problem over the change of venue , with @entity138 ’s three challengers effectively acting in concert to maximise opposition to a fifth term			0
@entity113 's launch of his @entity118 presidential campaign manifesto has been moved to @entity120 on thursday @entity145 chairman @entity144 outlined his serious concerns about the future of @entity148 to an @entity150 audience who took on board the message			2
@entity144 fears agreeing a future tours programme of @entity148 after 2019 will be hugely difficult such is the dominance of white - ball cricket			2
@entity156 are one of those countries in which test cricket is in steep decline and a seriously sub-standard test series in the @entity162 against @entity163 in april could mark @entity164 for the five - day game			2
@entity144 has implored @entity150 to do all they can to preserve @entity148 as the game ’s most important format			0
@entity145 chairman @entity144 ( right ) has outlined his fears about the steep decline of test cricket			0
