victorious : @entity1 singing in the @entity3 contest 1969			1
she won with song @entity6 he has already been told that an independent @entity8 may not be able to stay in the @entity9 or keep the pound			1
but now @entity11 faces perhaps the biggest threat his dream of @entity8 statehood			1
for the country ’s first minister has now been warned that , if it opts for secession , @entity8 might not be allowed to enter the @entity3			2
when the @entity20 leader unveiled a 670 - page ‘ blueprint ’ setting out the case for independence ahead of next september ’s landmark referendum he recommended replacing the @entity25 with @entity26 - using the assets of @entity28			1
@entity26 would broadcast @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in return for giving the @entity25 access to its existing resources north of the border			1
a spokesman for the annual festival said an independent @entity8 would have to reapply for membership of the @entity39 , which organises the contest – and accession would not be ‘ automatic ’			1
it means that it 2016 , the year mr @entity11 wants to see @entity8 re-gain its independence , the country may have to sit on the sidelines while the rest of the @entity47 fights it out			1
@entity8 singer @entity1 previously won the contest for the @entity47 in 1969 , with @entity50 ; while @entity51 came second to @entity52 in 1988			1
however , when the @entity47 entered with kilt - wearing @entity53 in 1966 , he only received votes from two countries			0
the blow over @entity3 comes just days after chancellor @entity57 said the country would not be able to share the pound with the rest of the @entity47 if it leaves the country			0
and @entity62 president @entity61 warned it would be ‘ difficult ’ for a post-independence @entity8 to re-enter the @entity9			2
decisions : it means that in 2016 , the year mr @entity11 wants to see @entity8 re-gain its independence , the country may have to sit on the sidelines while the rest of the @entity47 fights it out the annual song contest is run by the @entity39 , and a spokesman said it would require the @entity8 broadcaster to re-apply for entry once it leaves the @entity47 , as our country is known at @entity3			1
application involves a complicated list of criteria they would have to meet – and @entity8 would not be guaranteed admittance			2
@entity80 is not able to enter the song contest , in part because of the opposition of @entity84 , the country it seceded from six years ago			0
and @entity86 has warned that it will not allow its own potentially breakaway region of @entity88 to join international institutions			0
it raises the prospect that countries such as @entity86 , which are against the idea of separatism , could make it difficult for @entity8 to join up			2
the blow over @entity3 comes just days after chancellor @entity57 said the country would not be able to share the pound with the rest of the @entity47 if it leaves the country @entity39 spokesman @entity100 , who represents @entity3 , said : ‘ only active members of the @entity39 can take part in the @entity3 and there is a certain membership process			0
no automatic memberships are granted			0
’ mr @entity100 also said that the rest of the @entity47 might not get its free pass into the @entity3 final if @entity8 secedes			2
