by @entity0 now this is an odd one , @entity2 by name and curious by nature			1
@entity5 is an actress you will know from a thousand comedy shows on tv : she was in @entity9 with @entity10 and @entity11 , played a hapless politician in two series of @entity14 , and was @entity16 ’s mother in @entity17			1
last year , she was mrs @entity18 in @entity19 , and she has a nice recurring role in @entity21 , as the grouchy boss every tv detective is obliged to have by law			2
it ’s an impressive list of credits			1
funny old world : actress @entity5 has just written her new autobiographical book ' @entity2 ' like so many actors and actresses with brains and an excess of nervous energy , though , she writes as well			1
there have been @entity36 shows and columns for @entity38 , and now there ’s this book , a collection of autobiographical fragments that seeks to show us just how strange the world can be			1
these are true stories , she says , ‘ though perhaps a little bent out of shape in the telling ’			2
one senses that she is aiming at the widest possible readership			2
‘ if you recognise something of yourself in here , then great			0
if , on the other hand , it just confirms that yours is the only sane voice in an otherwise bonkers world , then that ’s fine too			1
’ so we hear of her grandmother , who like many of her generation had a sitting room that was kept for best : ‘ nobody went in it , because it was there for “ visitors ” , and no one who came to the house ever quite merited that description			0
’ in the thick of it : front playing hapless politician @entity69 alongside @entity70 as the foul - mouthed @entity71 @entity5 ’s parents ’ house , by contrast , was always a bit of a mess			1
her grandmother spent a lot of time there , and when they had people round , she always insisted on helping them tidy up afterwards			1
‘ when the final cushion was plumped , the last crumb @entity85 up , @entity84 would say with some pride : “ there			0
it ’s as if they had never been			0
” ’ and that , @entity5 began to realise , was the point			1
for her grandmother , a tidy house was an end in itself			0
‘ as the years of her long life gathered behind her , she appeared to have come to the conclusion that the best way to keep her home fit for others to see , was never to allow anyone in to see it , ’ @entity5 writes			1
there are tales of disastrous childhood holidays , of humiliation at university , of claustrophobia and panic attacks , and of her lifelong inability to swim			0
she fears trains because of the tunnels			0
she fears planes because she does n’t want to leave her children motherless			0
she undergoes hypnotherapy to cure her phobias , but ca n’t relax enough to enter a trance			0
even though she has taken a strong dislike to the hypnotherapist , sheer politeness compels her to pretend that the therapy has worked like a dream			0
like many of us , she suffers from the chronic disease of @entity126			0
i bet that when she eats a lousy meal in a restaurant , she does n’t complain , she tells the waiter it ’s delicious and silently vows never to go back			0
one of the best chapters is entitled @entity133			0
‘ i ’m the sort of person who is so preoccupied with appearing normal that i ca n’t buy four bottles of wine without remarking in a jaunty voice that they ’re not all for me			0
’ @entity2 and curiouser : front encounters a rabbit on the bus on a bus she sees a woman with a rabbit on a lead			1
the woman seems perfectly relaxed about it , but other passengers look at her and her rabbit as though she ’s not normal			1
all except for one woman , who pets the rabbit fondly			1
but then she starts to stare at the rabbit , stare and stare and stare			2
the rabbit ’s owner becomes uneasy			2
does this person want to steal her rabbit ? does she want to cook it ? her body tenses and her face hardens			2
‘ finally she did what all the other passengers had done to her : she turned her back and pretended the woman was n’t there			0
’ curious is full of such strange incidents , each of them reflected through the prism of @entity5 ’s distinctive take on the world			1
my first impression , though , was of a slight lack of focus			0
it ’s as though the publishers wanted one sort of book — a straight - down - the - line autobiography would be my guess — and the writer wanted to try something more ambitious , more akin to the work of the @entity187 humorist @entity186			1
the result is n’t quite either , and nor is it ‘ a beguiling celebration of the curiosities of life ’ , as the blurb - writer has put it , possibly tearing his or her hair out with frustration			2
nonetheless , a theme does emerge from the book , and that ’s anxiety			2
@entity5 , who admits she has become the @entity203 mother she was always destined to be , has anxieties to burn , and writes amusingly and perceptively about them			1
only she , having inadvertently shoplifted a bulb of garlic , could go back to the supermarket a few days later to pay for it , and then , having embarrassed herself utterly in conversation with the manager , walk out with a basket of goods she later realises she had n’t paid for			0
this is n’t curious , this is round the bend			1
and something close to normal life for a lot of us			0
