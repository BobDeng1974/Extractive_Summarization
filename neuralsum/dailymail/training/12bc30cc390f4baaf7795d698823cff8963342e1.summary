by @entity1 reporter published : 14:27 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 19:15 est , 23 october 2013 piracy charges against jailed @entity4 activists in @entity5 have been dropped and they have been charged with hooliganism instead			1
it means that instead of a possible 15 years imprisonment for piracy they could face seven years in jail			1
there is also still the possibility they could be charged with using force against official which carries a punishment of ten year imprisonment , @entity4 noted			1
piracy charges against the ' @entity20 have been dropped and replaced by hooliganism claims the @entity4 activists and journalists , who have been held in a @entity5 prison since being arrested in a protest against oil company @entity27 's platform in the @entity29 's @entity28 last month , ' are no more hooligans than they were pirates , ' according to @entity4			1
nothing less than the release of the detainees - dubbed the @entity29 30 - and the withdrawal of these ' trumped up ' charges would be acceptable , @entity4 argued			1
' this is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail			1
it represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest , ' a spokesman said			0
' those brave men and women went to the @entity29 armed with nothing more than a desire to shine a light on a reckless business			0
they should be with their families , not in a prison in @entity53			0
' we will contest the trumped - up charge of hooliganism as strongly as we contested the piracy allegations			1
they are both fantasy charges that bear no relation to reality			0
the @entity62 protested peacefully against @entity27 's dangerous oil drilling and should be free			0
' the move follows a comment by president @entity66 , who said last month that he does not think the @entity4 activists are pirates			1
a group of 28 @entity4 activists , a @entity5 photographer and a @entity73 videographer have been held since their ship , the @entity68 was seized by the @entity5 coast guard after protesting outside a @entity27 - owned oil rig september 18			1
a total of six @entity73 are being held			0
the @entity4 spokesman said : ' the @entity79 also say they may charge some activists with use of force against officials , carrying up to ten years in jail			1
' @entity4 has a 42 year history of entirely peaceful activism , it is a cheap libel to accuse those campaigners of doing anything other than protesting peacefully , they arrived at that oil rig in a ship painted with a dove and a rainbow			2
' our ship was seized by men with knives and guns , while the @entity62 raised their arms			0
they should be released immediately			0
' @entity102 , a @entity73 freelance videographer , stands in a defendants ' cage in a regional court in @entity5 the @entity62 and their boat were taken from waters near the port of @entity53 on september 19 after two of them tried to board the rig			2
those arrested include citizens of @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , the @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 and the @entity125			0
@entity4 has warned a spill in @entity29 waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts			2
@entity27 's plans to start drilling from the @entity136 platform in the first quarter of 2014 raised the risk of an oil spill in an area that contains three nature reserves protected by @entity5 law , campaigners have said			2
a high - profile international campaign calling for their release has seen 11 @entity147 laureates , including @entity149 archbishop @entity148 , write a letter to mr @entity66 urging that the piracy charges be dropped			2
the letter came after @entity153 chancellor @entity152 became the first head of state to raise the issue of the crew 's detention with mr @entity66 , urging a speedy resolution of the case in a phone call			0
the families of the @entity73 involved have also met @entity163 officials to discuss what was being done to bring their loved ones home .			0
