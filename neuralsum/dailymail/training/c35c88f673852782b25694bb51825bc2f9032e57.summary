by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:26 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 00:27 est , 3 august 2013 suspicious : @entity3 believes her family 's @entity5 searches caused a ' @entity7 ' to visit her house a journalist living in @entity10 was greatly mistaken when she published a blog post claiming that @entity5 searches for ‘ pressure cooker bombs ’ and ’ backpack ’ had led police to her doorstep			1
as it turns out , the police tip - off came from the former employers of @entity3 ’s husband @entity19			1
@entity21 police explained friday that ‘ detectives received a tip from a @entity25 - based computer company regarding suspicious computer searches conducted by a recently released employee			2
’ @entity19 , who worked as a product manager at @entity30 - based @entity29 , apparently had been searching for the terms ‘ pressure cooker bombs ’ and ‘ backpacks ’ on his work computer when his former employers began to fear that they may have a terrorist in their midst			2
that recent revelation followed a major uproar among internet users on thursday after @entity3 , a former contributor to @entity42 , published her piece , which prompted many to quickly blame the @entity44			1
@entity3 published her account of what happened on the site medium on thursday , saying six plain - clothes cops showed up at her home , and proceeded to interview her husband about pressure cookers and search her house			1
she said she believes her ' news junkie ' son reading articles on the @entity56 , coupled with her hunt for a pressure cooker and her husband 's online shopping for a backpack created the ' perfect storm of terrorism profiling			1
' the @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 maintained that they had no invo9levement in the call			1
though @entity3 was n't at home at the time , her husband @entity69 was when three black suvs drove up to their house and the cops exited and started to approach their property , flashing badges with handguns in their holsters			1
@entity69 went outside to meet the men and complied with their request to look around the house and backyard			2
they walked around the living room , looked at books and pictures , and petted their dogs			2
when they asked to go into the son 's room , her husband said he was sleeping and they left him alone			2
they also interviewed him , asking about where he was from , where his wife was , and if they had any bombs			2
they also asked about whether they owned a pressure cooker			0
her husband said no , but that they had a rice cooker			0
' can you make a bomb with that ? ' they asked			0
he told them his wife used it to make quinoa			0
' what the hell is quinoa ? ' they asked			0
what the hell is quinoa ? after asking whether the family had a pressure cooker , @entity3 's husband said they only have a rice cooker to cook quinoa			1
the officers were mystified by the ancient grain @entity3 said that ' by this point they realized they were not dealing with terrorists and the men wrapped their search up			1
@entity69 called her immediately after , laughing about the incident , but @entity3 did n't see the humor			1
she said she felt a ' great sense of anxiety ' when she realized that ' this is where we are at			0
' ' where you have no expectation of privacy			0
where trying to learn how to cook some lentils could possibly land you on a terrorism watch list , ' she wrote			0
the @entity64 confirmed the visit to @entity147 , but said their officers were n't involved			1
a spokesman said it was @entity65 police officers working in conjunction with the @entity153			1
but a @entity65 police spokesman told @entity156 they were n't involved			1
' we did not , did not , go out to this woman 's home , ' police spokesman @entity157 said			2
' what agency went i could n't tell you			0
' a @entity66 spokesman referred media back to the @entity64			1
if the search were truly carried out due to suspicious @entity5 searches , it would have required a warrant			1
in a company report on transparency , @entity5 detailed how they deal with law enforcement officials looking for evidence online			1
' the government needs legal process — such as a subpoena , court order or search warrant — to force @entity5 to disclose user information			1
exceptions can be made in certain emergency cases , though even then the government ca n’t force @entity5 to disclose			1
' which has led some to question the validity of ms @entity3 's story			1
today , she took to @entity186 , writing that she was n't giving interviews to the media			2
' i 'll say it once : i did n't make it up , ' she wrote			0
' thanks to those defending my integrity			0
' on friday , @entity3 sang a different tune			1
her story update on @entity197 read : ' we found out through the @entity199 that the searches involved also things my husband looked up at his old job			2
we were not made aware of this at the time of questioning and were led to believe it was solely from searches from within our house			2
' i did not lie or make it up			0
i wrote the piece with the information that was given			0
what was withheld from us obviously could not be a part of a story i wrote based on what happened yesterday			0
' the piece i wrote was the story as we knew it with the information we were told			0
none of it was fabricated			0
if you know me , you know i would never do that			0
' if it was misleading , just know that my intention was the truth			0
and that was what i knew as the truth until about ten minutes ago			0
that there were other circumstances involved was something we all were unaware of			0

@entity3 , a former writer for @entity42 , published an account of the raid today
she believes it was her family 's recent @entity5 searches that prompted the visit
the @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity153 have denied *responsibility* in the search
