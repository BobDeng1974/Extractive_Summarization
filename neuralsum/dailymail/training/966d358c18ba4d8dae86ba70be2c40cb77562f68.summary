@entity0 today announced he had secured agreement with @entity3 's network of overseas territories and crown dependencies to sign up to a new clampdown on tax evasion			2
the prime minister has been holding high level talks in @entity10 ahead of next week 's @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13 where tax evasion is one of the leading topics for discussion			1
getting agreement from @entity3 ’s overseas territories , among them @entity18 , the @entity22 , the @entity23 , @entity24 , the @entity25 and the @entity26 is seen as a crucial step in the forthcoming negotiations			2
tax haven : crown dependency @entity18 claimed it complied with international tax law already so did not need to sign the @entity33 - @entity32 backed register @entity3 ’s overseas territories make up one fifth of all the tax havens - and are among the largest and most sophisticated - in the world			1
until today @entity18 was refusing to sign up to the register backed by @entity3 , the @entity33 , @entity32 and @entity40			2
@entity18 had claimed it already met many of the provisions mr @entity0 wants the tax havens to sign up to and was not ready to commit to signing the convention			2
premier mr @entity45 told @entity46 : ‘ there 's some clauses in there that we need to look at , that may need to be adjusted , and ... our finance ministry is going over it with a fine - tooth comb			0
’ even after the announcement several overseas territories said the still have misgivings about whether an international register of companies and their beneficial owners will work			1
the prime minister hailed the agreement as a ‘ very positive step forward ’ which would strengthen his hand in talks with the other @entity11 leaders			1
he is hoping to reach agreement from the leaders of all the @entity11 nations to a series of actions aimed at promoting transparency and exchange of information between tax jurisdictions			0
done deal : the prime minister moved a step closer to securing a deal on tax evasion after securing the agreement of @entity3 's overseas territories to sign up to a new international register ' let 's be clear why this tax issue matters			1
if companies do n't pay their taxes or individuals do n't pay their taxes we all suffer as a result , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' it is important we are getting our house in order			0
what the crown dependencies - places like @entity95 and the @entity26 , and the overseas territories - places like the @entity23 - have signed up to is basically the existing and the new standards for exchanging tax information			0
‘ ' it is a very positive step forward and it means that @entity3 's voice in the @entity11 and the campaigning on this issue around the world for proper taxes , proper companies and proper laws ... will be stronger			1
' despite the agreement , mr @entity0 still has to win over a key opponent in the @entity113 prime minister @entity112 , who is not convinced by the proposals being put forward by @entity3 , the @entity33 and the @entity32			1
@entity116 president @entity115 could also prove to be a roadblock to the reforms			0
international aid organisations have also been quick raise concerns about the @entity22 proposals which they say amount to a plan a and a plan @entity126 yesterday they delivered a letter to mr @entity0 and the other @entity11 leaders with 189 signatories warning the plan b proposal would effectively lock out developing nations from the register and deny them access to crucial information they need to collect tax efficiently			1
under the original plan all countries would have been able to access the register but the under the watered down proposal only internationally recognised tax authorities , such as @entity143 would be able to access the register			0
the letter warns this would mean : ‘ excluding developing countries that wish to join such an international system either directly or de facto through an unfeasible burden of reciprocation of information – would in many cases freeze out those … worst hit by tax avoidance and evasion			0
’ a spokesman for the charity action aid , one of the signatories to the letter , said the plan b option would amount to betrayal of the world ’s poorest countries preventing them from collecting ‘ desperately needed tax revenues that could be used to fund schools and hospitals			0

@entity18 now agrees to sign up to international register of companies
prime minister hails agreement as an ' very positive step forward '
