by @entity0 warned : @entity1 has been told @entity2 is in the midst of a double - dip recession , heaping more pressure on the chancellor after controversy over his tax on hot takeaway food and a fuel duty rise @entity1 suffered a bruising blow yesterday when a leading global watchdog declared that @entity2 is back in recession			1
the @entity14 said output fell by 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2012 , having dropped by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2011			1
if official figures next month from the @entity21 back up the respected think - tank ’s findings , it will be the first double - dip recession in @entity2 since 1975			1
the gloomy verdict – from such a highly respected think tank – is a bitter blow for the chancellor just seven days after his much - maligned ' pasty tax ' announced in the @entity28			2
the @entity29 - based @entity14 is a long - time supporter of the chancellor 's battle to repair the economic and financial damage of the @entity35 years			1
but its view that the @entity2 is in the midst of a double - dip recession will be seized on by @entity35 as evidence that even mr @entity1 's most loyal supporters do not think his plan is working			1
mr @entity42 is already under fire for his controversial tax on takeaway food and a planned rise in fuel duty			2
petrol stations have begun rationing fuel before the rise kicks in and the @entity51 is on standby after ministers were accused of spreading panic			2
retailers such as pasty - maker @entity55 have also been up in arms about the planned rise in @entity58 on hot snacks , depending on their ' ambient temperature ' , from october			0
now bakers and food chains are planning to mobilise angry pasty fans to block the new levy			0
in its report , the @entity14 also warned the recovery for the world 's biggest economies would be fragile , with the outlook for @entity70 ' very weak '			0
a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline			2
@entity2 plunged into a brutal recession in early 2008 as the financial crisis and banking crash wreaked havoc on the world economy			1
but it started recovering at the end of 2009 – albeit slowly			0
here motorists panic buy fuel in @entity91 , @entity92 @entity93 figures also out today have fuelled predictions of further property price falls the return to recession will fuel fears that the @entity2 faces years of high unemployment and stagnant growth			1
economists have warned that @entity2 is in the grip of the longest economic slump for 100 years – worse even than the @entity104 of the 1930s			1
but they are divided as to whether gdp will fall in the first quarter of the year			0
a number of upbeat surveys have suggested a return to mild growth in the quarter			0
and any slump would be modest compared with the 2008/09 recession and the @entity14 predicts a return to growth in the second quarter of the year			1
the @entity21 today said the powerhouse services sector grew by 0.2 per cent between december and january , after a slight decline in the final quarter of 2011			0
however , it is generally agreed that the @entity2 's economic growth will be feeble for the first half of 2012 at least , although falling inflation should increasingly deliver a boost to consumer spending as the year progresses			1
the government 's independent forecaster , the @entity129 , predicts the @entity2 will avoid a recession but the economy will grow by just 0.8 per cent over the course of 2012			1
@entity133 : @entity55 could launch an online @entity135 petition against the controversial @entity58 hike @entity137 , an economist at @entity138 , predicts the economy will grow by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year			0
he said : ' recent indications suggest the @entity2 's economy will have expanded in the first quarter			1
our own view is that the @entity14 is being too gloomy			0
' the services sector appears to have strengthened , the manufacturing sector is recovering since the end of last year and there 's been signs of strength in retail spending			0
' meanwhile , the @entity14 warned of a two - speed recovery developing in the @entity155 nations , with @entity156 enjoying a rapid expansion but @entity70 weighed down by austerity measures			0
the @entity14 said the recent hikes in oil prices , which have pushed @entity162 crude to above 120 @entity163 dollars a barrel , would push inflation up higher than it previously thought , wiping up to 0.2 % from growth across @entity155 nations over the next year			0
which is already in recession , to contract for te first two quarters of 2012 , while @entity172 will contract in the first quarter and @entity175 's growth will be lacklustre			2
in november , the @entity14 warned the eurozone crisis was a key risk for the @entity2 economy and it today called for the firewall to be increased in size to help prevent the crisis worsening			2
it last year slashed the @entity2 's 2012 growth forecast to just 0.5 per cent from 1.8 per cent earlier in the year and said it expects unemployment to hit 9.1 per cent by 2013 , putting another 400,000 people out of work			1
@entity93 figures showed today that mortgage approvals for house purchase have dropped to their lowest level since last june , fuelling predictions of further property price falls			2
the report showed a sharp dip in approvals even before the ending of a two - year stamp duty concession for first - time buyers , which finished last saturday			0
there were 48,986 loan approvals for house purchase in february worth £ 7.1billion , almost 9,000 fewer such loans than in january , which was a 25 - month high			2
the figures follow concerns from lenders and estate agents that a rush to beat the stamp duty deadline would be followed by a dip once the 1 per cent duty for first - time buyers on properties worth between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000 was reinstated			0
the @entity93 report was published on the same day that @entity214 said house prices recorded a monthly fall of 1 per cent in march			0
last week in his @entity28 speech , the chancellor predicted the economy would avoid slipping into recession			1
he said the @entity129 had estimated @entity2 would be in positive growth within the first quarter of 2012			1
mr @entity1 added that the @entity129 's forecast for @entity2 growth was 0.8 per cent in 2012 , 2 per cent in 2013 , 2.7 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent in both 2015 and 2016			1
