by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 15:07 est , 17 december 2012 beauty , brawn and a blistering sound quality			1
@entity6 ’s latest , fully licenced , exclusive @entity5 headset is a joy to behold from the moment you begin unboxing			1
with an eye on @entity13 , it aims to make itself the pinnacle for @entity5 owners			0
first impressions of the warhead 7.1 are very impressive with a lot of aesthetically pleasing features			0
there ’s plenty of deep - black plastics and futuristic design with a sleek , triangular base and weighty headset ; despite their size they sit very comfortably			1
sound investment : the warhead may be pricy , but their build quality is second to none in the past , headsets have been slated for their difficult setup , confusing cables or incompatibility with aspects of the console in use , yet the warhead could n’t be easier to set up			1
the pyramid base station deals with the wireless connection and doubles up as a stand for the headset			1
all it needs is a power source and a cable that runs into the back of your @entity5			0
another perk is that the headset is compatible no matter which @entity5 you have , with adaptor cables supplied as standard to be used where required			2
you ’re also provided with a spare battery , so one can charge whilst one is used – a praiseworthy inclusion			0
the warhead provides a glorious sound			2
its clarity is a cut above with a plethora of deep bass and crystal clear treble			0
the ‘ over ear ’ design , where the users ear sits completely inside the earcups , offers improved sound isolation and enhanced acoustics giving you complete immersion in the game you ’re playing			1
@entity77 have developed the warhead utilising @entity80 wireless technology compared to the industry standard of @entity82 thus offering a superior performance and a quality sound equal to that of a wired headset			1
amongst its already impressive features and sound you are able to switch between 3 different settings ; music , games and video , as well as the ability to toggle between muting and hearing the sound of your own voice whilst you play			2
at £ 229.99 the warhead is not cheap , though you get what you pay for , a sleek looking headset that pounds your eardrums with an abundance of rich tones			0
for the keen @entity5 gamer – this is the must have headset and has set the bar for its competitors very high indeed			0
