@entity1 forward @entity0 is set for a ' great future ' at @entity3 , but manager @entity4 warned all his players their first duty is to serve the club - whether that is on the pitch or on the bench			1
@entity0 joined the @entity11 on transfer deadline day from @entity13 , where he had become frustrated at a lack of opportunities in his preferred central striker role			1
since the return to fitness and form of @entity22 , who spent four months out with a broken leg , the 24 - year - old has found himself deployed on the flank of a front three along with @entity25 , rather than down the middle			0
@entity0 joined @entity3 from @entity13 last summer after growing frustrated at bit - part role the striker was left on the bench for wednesday 's @entity31 match against @entity32 @entity0 was a late substitute for both of the previous two @entity31 matches , but could face his former club in monday night 's @entity37 quarter - final at @entity38			1
wenger is convinced @entity0 , who has seven @entity3 goals , can play a big part in the future of the team , but like everyone else has to earn their place in the starting @entity47 ' @entity0 puts big team effort in , he plays very well for me and is an exceptional player who will have a great future here , ' said @entity4 , who confirmed centre - back @entity52 was set for ' two to three weeks ' out with a hamstring injury suffered in the midweek @entity31 win over @entity32 at @entity56			1
' the subject is raised because he is a former @entity13 player , ( but ) i am very , very happy that i bought him			2
' @entity4 continued : ' @entity0 is very important and has played many , many games since the start of the season			1
the @entity1 international was also absent from the starting line - up against @entity63 last sunday @entity4 says @entity0 has a bright future at @entity3 but faces a lot of competition ' his position is one of the three up front , central , left or right			1
' @entity1 forward @entity71 is another who has watched on from the bench in recent weeks , as @entity4 finally enjoys the luxury of strength in depth			1
the @entity3 boss added : ' we have a lot of competition going on in the team , especially up front - we have plenty of offensive potential			1
it makes every decision more difficult			0
' people always raise these kind of questions when ( either ) you do not have enough players , or when you do have enough players			0
' ( however ) , we have chosen a job where competition is part of our job			2
that means we ca n't complain about that , because we have made that choice			0
' our job is to serve the club and to compete with other people to do as well as we can to serve the club			0
the 24 - year - old could return to the side for monday night 's @entity37 clash against former side @entity13 @entity4 confirmed he will be without defender @entity52 for up to three weeks due to a hamstring injury ' the only important thing is what the club achieves - all of us are only here for that			1
' @entity3 have a poor record at @entity38 , not winning since september 2006 and suffering an 8 - 2 thumping there in august 2011			2
@entity4 , though , sees no reason why the @entity11 , who are ahead of @entity13 in the @entity31 table , should not be able to produce the required performance this time around			1
' i do n't believe too much in history , i just believe in the performance on the day , ' he said			0
' at the moment we are doing very well away from home			0
the size of the pitch is exactly the same everywhere , it is just down to how much we turn up and how much effort we put in to win the game			0
' both teams will think if we get over this hurdle , we have a good opportunity to win the competition			0
@entity4 was forced to defend @entity134 after criticism from former @entity13 midfielder @entity136 ' we are confident from our @entity31 run , so we go to @entity13 to qualify and to give absolutely everything			2
' @entity4 , meanwhile , rejected criticism of @entity134 by former @entity13 midfielder @entity136 , who claimed the @entity142 playmaker was only ' going through the motions ' at @entity3			1
' i think a player like @entity136 would have loved to play with @entity134 , ' @entity4 said			2
' we are all in a job where in every single game we have to prove a point			0
' i believe @entity134 has the quality , he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows			0
' you can be cheated a little bit by his style of play , because he is fluent , easy , subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in , but he does			0
