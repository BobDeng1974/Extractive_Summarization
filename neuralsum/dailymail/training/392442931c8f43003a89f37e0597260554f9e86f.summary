by @entity0 there has been constant speculation about footballer @entity4 ’s career after he bit an @entity6 player in the @entity7 – but little concern for his victim , @entity10			1
yet being bitten is n’t just painful and unpleasant , it can have serious health implications			1
‘ the bite of a human can be an extremely dangerous wound , ’ says professor @entity13 from the @entity14 of @entity15 , @entity16			1
‘ if the bite pierces the skin , this bacteria will enter the body and has the potential to pose a serious threat			1
’ grandmother @entity36 suffered a bite in much more innocent circumstances , but knows only too well the serious implications			2
she was hospitalised and nearly lost a finger after a playful bite from her grandson turned toxic			2
the two - year - old accidentally bit her during a bathtime tussle over a flannel he had clamped between his teeth			1
‘ it looked no worse than a pin prick and i thought nothing more about it at the time , ’ says @entity36 , 67 , a retired lab technician from @entity46 in @entity47			2
‘ my grandson @entity53 ’s not a biter			2
i know some youngsters are while teething , but this was purely in play			2
’ banned : @entity22 footballer @entity4 was suspended for biting @entity59 's @entity10 the finger felt slightly tender the next day but it was n’t until the following night that she realised something was wrong			1
@entity36 recalls : ‘ i woke in the night as my finger was really painful			2
i tried to get out of bed but was so dizzy and faint that i barely made it to the bathroom before i started throwing up			0
’ the next thing she remembers is her husband @entity69 , 67 , pushing her into @entity70 at @entity71 in a wheelchair			0
when @entity69 said the symptoms started with a bite , she was immediately seen by doctors and put on intravenous antibiotics			0
they explained that her body was trying , and failing , to fight off a streptococcal infection as bacteria in the mouth – even a two - year - old ’s – can turn a wound toxic			1
danger : @entity10 's injury could have exposed him to hundreds of different strains of oral bacteria plastic surgeon @entity88 , locum consultant at @entity89 , says : ‘ people fondly expect that the human mouth is cleaner than an animal ’s , but we have to disappoint them			1
’ he deals with people who have been bitten by pets and livestock – but forty per cent of the bites he sees are human , and typically on young men who get into drunken fights			1
many people do n’t seek treatment at all as they assume human bites are n’t serious , or stay away out of guilt and embarrassment , says mr @entity88			1
‘ we see a lot of “ fight bites ” , as we call them , but there is often a delay as guys do n’t want to say that their knuckle started bleeding after they punched someone in the face			1
’ the hands are the most commonly bitten part of the body and the most susceptible to complications , because there is so little flesh around the joints and it ’s easier for teeth to penetrate the protective casing around nerves and ligaments			0
that ’s what happened to @entity36 : @entity53 ’s bite punctured @entity36 ’s flesh and the flexor sheath around the ligament on her finger			0
this meant the infection became trapped inside the sheath , where there is no blood flow – the body ’s normal way of flushing out the poisons			0
@entity36 spent four days on an intravenous drip before being sent home , but a week later there was no improvement so she was transferred to @entity146 for surgery to ‘ irrigate ’ the finger and flush out the infection with saline solution			0
this involved inserting a thin plastic tube into the sheath round the ligament			0
by now her hand and forearm were red and swollen			0
‘ the anaesthetist told me that if the procedure did n’t work , i may lose the finger , ’ says @entity36			0
’ @entity36 spent 14 days in hospital , having two operations to flush out the toxins and remove ‘ necrotic ’ or dead tissue from the wound , followed by 12 weeks of physiotherapy			0
‘ it could be a year before it feels normal again , ’ she says			0
‘ people ca n’t believe it was all caused by a bite from my grandson			0
we need to be more aware of how dangerous a human bite can be			1

@entity22 's @entity4 bit @entity6 @entity10 during a game
human bites can be just as dangerous as those from animals
a healthy mouth contains 100 - 200 different strains of oral bacteria
