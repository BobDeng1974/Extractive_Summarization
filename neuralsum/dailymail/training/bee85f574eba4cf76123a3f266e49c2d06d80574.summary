a woman in @entity2 , @entity0 came home from a two - week vacation last month to discover her house had been mistakenly repossessed			1
at first @entity6 , 36 , thought the changed locks meant a squatter , but reality turned out to be much worse than that when she broke into her own home and found it completely emptied			2
it turns out the repo men sent by @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity0 to gut the house , had mistaken @entity19 's house for the bank - owned home across the street			1
unpleasant surprise : when @entity6 returned from vacation last month , she found her house had been mistakenly repossessed ' a gps had led them to my house , the president of the bank told me , ' @entity19 told 10 tv			1
' they also said my grass had n't been mowed so they just assumed that was the house			0
' ms @entity6 points out that the houses are clearly marked			2
the bank owned 509 , and her house is 514			0
the wrong house : the gps system used by the repo men took them to @entity19 's house , number 514 , instead of bank - owned number 509			1
they assumed that the overgrown grass meant it was the correct property now ms @entity6 , a nurse with children ages six to 18 , wants her life back , but the bank is n't being accommodating in the way she hoped			1
ms @entity6 sent the bank an estimate of the lost items , totaling $ 18,000 and the president refused to pay it			1
among the items lost in the foreclosure were car engine parts valued at $ 9,000			0
' he told me that i would probably need receipts for everything that they took and they were not paying retail			0
i told him i was n't running a yard sale and asking them to make me an offer , ' ms @entity6 told @entity71			2
empty rooms : the family is currently living with what furniture the bank left behind proof of purchase : ms @entity6 says the bank has asked her to provide receipts for everything she lost ' i told him i do n't keep receipts around for everything i have just in a case a bank comes by and steals my stuff			1
and if i did , where do you think it would be ? with the stuff that you threw away ? ' bank president and ceo @entity91 issued a statement with their side of the store			2
mr @entity91 apologized for the incident , saying : ' nothing like this has ever happened before			0
' as for ms @entity6 's list of losses , he insists that the written list of items she provided were ' inconsistent with the list and descriptions of items removed that was prepared by the employees who did the work			1
' inconsistent : @entity15 's president and ceo @entity91 said ms @entity6 's list of items is different from the list his repo men prepared while emptying the house @entity19 has retained an attorney and plans to sue the bank			1
' we are definitely going to bring a lawsuit , ' she said			0
' i gave them a chance and they are not willing to work with me			0
' outrage over the faulty repression has spread to the internet			0
one petition has over 13,000 signers demanding @entity15 pay ms @entity6 her money immediately ' so she can get her life back again			2
' for the time being , @entity19 and her children are living with just the furniture that the bank left behind			0
' it 's kind of ruined their summer , that 's for sure , ' she said .			0

@entity6 , a nurse in @entity2 , @entity0 , was on a two - week vacation with her family when her house was repossessed by @entity15 of @entity16
the bank 's repo men confused her house for the bank - owned home when their gps led them to the wrong *destination*
they assumed overgrown grass meant they were at the correct home
ms @entity6 created a list of lost items totaling $ 18,000 which the bank refuses to pay
bank president @entity162 says the list is ' inconsistent ' with the list they prepared during the repossession
ms @entity6 has retained a lawyer and plans to sue the bank
