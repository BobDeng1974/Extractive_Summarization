by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 4 june 2013 the @entity2 ‘ @entity3 ’ giant @entity1 is giving up on a multi-million pound drive to force @entity6 crops on to dinner tables in @entity8 and @entity9			1
the company said the decision has been driven by the fact that the vast majority of farmers and consumers have no interest in growing or eating the crops			1
the move comes despite the fact the environment secretary @entity20 has made it his business to back @entity6 farming and food			1
genetically modified : a test site for genetically modified winter oilseed rape crop in @entity26 he has launched a series of initiatives designed to overturn public scepticism and to try and speed up the approval of new gm crops by the @entity33			1
mr @entity20 has suggested that the @entity8 could go it alone and begin growing @entity6 crops even if other @entity37 member states maintain their own bans			2
however , @entity1 spokesman , @entity39 , said : ‘ we are no longer working on lobbying for more cultivation in @entity9			1
‘ currently we do not plan to apply for the approval of new genetically modified crops			1
the reason is , among other things , low demand of the farmers			1
’ a farmer shows two corncobs of genetically engineered @entity50 by @entity1 ( right ) and two normal corncobs on a field near the village of @entity54 , @entity55 this was confirmed by a spokesman for @entity58 , @entity59 , who told the media there that the company recognises there is no demand			1
she said : ‘ we 've understood that such plants do n't have any broad acceptance in @entity9 societies			0
it is counterproductive to fight against windmills			0
’ other @entity6 companies , such as @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , have also dramatically scaled back or dropped efforts to get their crops accepted in @entity9			0
successive @entity8 governments have bowed to pressure from @entity2 politicians and lobbied for the acceptance of @entity6 crops in the @entity37 , however other member states have remained opposed			0
eight governments have banned cultivation of a @entity1 @entity6 maize called @entity86 , which is genetically modified to kill pests which feed on it , on the basis it might cause harm to other important insects			1
the ban on the maize and other forms of @entity6 has been made under an @entity37 environmental protection provision known as the ‘ @entity97 '			0
the eight are @entity55 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and most recently @entity105 , while @entity106 said it plans to follow suit			0
even @entity2 consumers are now becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of biotech farming with pressure in many states for the labelling of food containing @entity6 ingredients			2
while @entity1 and others may have given up on growing @entity6 food in @entity9 , they continue to lobby for @entity8 and @entity9 to accept imports of the biotech crops for animal feed			2
a number of leading @entity8 supermarkets recently announced they would allow @entity6 feed to be given to chicken , pigs and cattle for the first time			0
@entity131 , @entity129 ’s and the co-op have joined other major names , including @entity133 and @entity134 in allowing @entity6 soya and maize to be used as animal feed			0
the companies claimed they had no choice because it was becoming increasingly difficult to find @entity141 soya from @entity142 , the @entity2 and other sources			0
this has been denied by suppliers in @entity142 , while supermarkets in many other countries , including a number in @entity9 , say they will continue to source non-genetically modified crops for their farm animals			2
the @entity8 stores will not label the meat , eggs and milk coming from these animals to identify their @entity6 diet despite research saying this is what most shoppers want			0
critics of the decision suggest the stores have effectively allowed @entity6 firms to decide @entity8 food policy rather than customers .			2
