@entity0 , the @entity1 vice- chairman , says @entity3 replays and the two - legged @entity5 semi-finals may have to be sacrificed in the season of the @entity7			1
why wait ? if anything , replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition , and the format of what is currently the @entity5 is an anomaly			1
it should not take @entity17 ’s monstrous destruction of football ’s calendar to make the @entity21 game see sense			1
by chance , there were no replays in the @entity3 fifth round this year and they were not missed			1
the great @entity7 shocks of this campaign have all happened on the day , inside 90 minutes			2
@entity0 suggested removing cup replays , and he has a point , even if it it has taken @entity32 to make it happen @entity34 were excellent to earn a replay against @entity36 , but lost the second game that is when @entity39 beat @entity40 and @entity41 , when @entity42 eliminated @entity43 , when @entity44 beat @entity45 then @entity46			1
a few lower division tussles aside , all the games that went to replays went with form			0
@entity36 defeated @entity34 , @entity41 won at @entity52 , @entity51 came from behind to beat @entity53 and @entity54 won against @entity55			0
replays favour the bigger teams anyway			0
if @entity58 could have taken @entity36 to extra-time , and maybe to penalties , on a crummy pitch at a boisterous @entity61 , who knows what might have happened ? heading to a decider at @entity67 , their moment had passed			0
@entity69 's goal against @entity40 was part of a shock that re-affirmed the @entity3 's giant killing tradition bradford celebrate their win at @entity75 , and did n't need a replay to upset the @entity78 leaders we cling to tradition , but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated			1
those encounters had an epic feel			0
in 1979 , @entity87 and @entity88 needed five matches — including three that went to extra-time — lasting nine hours before they could be torn apart			0
the second replay ended 2 - 2 , the third 3 - 3			0
@entity87 won the fourth 2 - 0			0
that is the true gladiatorial tradition of the @entity3 , but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion			1
so as the shoot - out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise , why is it needed at all ? @entity42 also caused an upset , by beating @entity43 , but replays rarely lead to shocks smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot - out a game decided on the day , one hit , with extra-time and penalties , would go some way to restoring tension and drama			1
when the @entity1 has to alter its company accounts because the @entity3 sponsorship deal confidently included by former general secretary @entity116 has not materialised , it is ridiculous to pretend the current format is a winner			2
the same with the @entity5			2
it is decided over one game in every round , then two in the semi-finals , and back to one for the final			2
what is the point of that ? better to have consistency and let the calendar breathe a little			0
it should not need @entity17 ’s selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the @entity21 game			1
the time to change is now .			0

@entity7 likely to force changes to *domestic* calendar
but @entity3 replays have lost their appeal - they should be *scrapped*
upsets rarely happen in the second game , giant - killing would not suffer
two - leg @entity5 semi-finals are a strain on the fixture list
some traditions should be removed , not just because of @entity17 's issues
