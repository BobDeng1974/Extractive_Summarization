a zoo in @entity1 claims it is home to the biggest and oldest common wombat in captivity			1
@entity5 the wombat weighs in at an astonish 79lbs ( 36kg ) despite the average for its species being somewhere between that figure and 32lbs ( 15kg )			1
at 30 years old @entity5 has also lived a lot longer than the expected age of a wombat			1
@entity5 's handler , @entity13 , said : ‘ we believe he is the oldest common wombat in captivity			2
‘ to live that long is pretty good going			0
in the wild they probably only average 10 to 15 years			2
‘ but you know , he has got a happy home , good food and lots of cuddles so he is thriving			0
’ a resident at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity1 , the wombat initially appears to be an average size when it first features in the video			1
@entity34 ! when @entity5 the wombat first features in the video he appears to be an average size but once it is picked up by its handler , the sheer size of the mammal is striking			2
however , according to ms @entity13 , the wombat is actually lighter than it used to be			0
‘ well he was 40kg in his heyday			0
of course , as you get older you lose a bit of weight so he is about 36kg now , ' said ms @entity13			0
according to @entity5 's handler , @entity13 , in its ' heyday ' the wombat weighed a whopping 40kg quite a handful ! at 79lbs , @entity5 is a lot heavier than the average wombat who weighs somewhere between that figure and 32lbs @entity5 has been in captivity nearly his entire life at the @entity27 as – rather surprisingly – he could n’t defend himself against other wombats in the wild			1

with hundreds of thousands of fans , @entity5 also has his own @entity67 page and he was named the 3rd best ' city mascot ' in the world back in 2014			0
