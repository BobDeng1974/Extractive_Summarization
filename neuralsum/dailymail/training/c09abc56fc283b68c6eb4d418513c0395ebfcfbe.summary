@entity0 believes @entity1 will have been unhappy to find himself rested and on the bench for @entity5 's @entity4 clash with @entity6 on tuesday			1
seemingly with an eye on saturday 's @entity10 clash with @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity5 boss @entity7 decided to rest a number of key players for the trip to the @entity16 , including skipper @entity1			1
however , former @entity17 midfielder @entity0 believes @entity1 retired from @entity19 duty in order to play in @entity5 's big @entity22 nights and told @entity23 : ' i think that 's probably why he gave up international football , to play in games like this			1
i do n't think he 'll be happy tonight			0
@entity1 wo n't have been happy starting on the bench against @entity6 , according to @entity0 captain @entity1 was one of a number of first - teamers left out including @entity32 and @entity33 @entity0 , who played over 130 games for the @entity35 in @entity36 , added that 34 - year - old @entity1 is more than capable of playing in the @entity38 capital on tuesday before taking on @entity40 's @entity39 in the @entity10 four days later			1
' i think @entity1 is capable of playing in this game and on saturday ( against @entity11 )			1
it is tuesday night , he 'll have two - day recovery , train friday , play saturday and he 's got a nice little two weeks off			2
' asked what @entity5 ' best plan of action was against the might of @entity6 , @entity0 replied before the game : ' avoid a doing			2
although it 's highly likely with this team			0
@entity51 said @entity52 and @entity53 are the weak links but they wo n't have to do much defending			0
then you have ( @entity58 ) @entity57 and ( @entity60 ) @entity59 controlling the game in the middle with ( @entity63 ) @entity63 and ( @entity66 ) @entity65 upfront			0
' @entity69 , captaining the side in @entity1 's absence , stops @entity63 in his tracks on tuesday meanwhile , @entity71 admitted @entity7 ' decision to rest so many first - teamers was risky and hinted that those left out should probably have been left in @entity19			1
' it seems they are definitely prioritising for the @entity11 game , ' said the former @entity79 defender			2
' @entity7 is trying to find the right balance between giving a performance and getting a result but it could be a risky prospect			0
' if i 'm a player i want to rest at home and rest properly rather than travelling			0
