when @entity1 signed @entity2 on transfer deadline day it was seen by many as a decent stop - gap until @entity6 returns from injury			1
the @entity9 striker will be back come the @entity10 and @entity11 was in desperate need of cover			0
but in the long run , with @entity16 soon to return to action , @entity2 's arrival could mean a significant change of style for @entity1			1
a front three of the former @entity22 forward , @entity16 and summer signing @entity23 is on the cards			2
and it could be the quickest front three in the @entity26			0
@entity2 joins @entity16 , @entity23 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 as men who can lead the line			2
and behind that there is even more choice			0
@entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 provide a wealth of possibility at the @entity59			0
a probable forward line , with all players available , of @entity2 , @entity16 and @entity23 will mean a move away from that measured style for @entity11			1
of course , the passing football will remain in tact , but the slow build - up and lack of penetration should be long gone			0
@entity1 badly missed @entity16 after his injury in january , without any players running in behind @entity6			1
@entity11 has tinkered with a 4 - 5 - 1 formation this season to get the best out of @entity56 and @entity55 , though the 4 - 3 - 3 will best suit this team			0
a flavour of @entity1 's 2003/04 counter attack could be back on the cards , with @entity53 able to thread through balls through to the raft of speedsters			1
' i believe the style of play the manager 's got and the boys play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through , i can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away , ' @entity2 said upon arriving at the club			2
bench life : @entity2 will be given more chance to impress in his favourite central role at @entity1 time to create : @entity53 will have plenty of runners to thread through this season in the @entity26 often played on the wing and out of the goals at @entity22 and for @entity106 , the 23 - year - old now has his chance			1
and with the players around him , there should be no excuse			0
@entity2 's speed and power coupled with @entity23 and @entity16 is a mouth - watering prospect , so watch out @entity26 .			2

@entity2 sealed Â£ 16m move from @entity22 on deadline day
will be @entity1 's new striker with @entity6 out through injury
@entity23 and @entity16 could for frightening front three
@entity53 will have players running on to his through balls
