victim : @entity1 told @entity2 she was violently assaulted by seven men in a fraternity house two weeks into her first year at @entity5 the @entity2 article about an alleged gang - rape at a @entity5 fraternity is unraveling even more as three friends who supported the victim , identified as ' @entity1 ' , have refuted key points of the account she detailed to the magazine			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ( all pseudonyms ) told the @entity18 that while they were featured prominently in @entity1 's account of the night , they were never contacted by reporter @entity20 to give their side of the story , despite the article saying @entity14 turned down an interview ' citing loyalty to his own frat '			1
they said they believe something traumatic happened to @entity1 the night they found her distraught , but are suspicious of the story she told @entity2 since it contradicts both what they saw and what she initially told them happened inside the @entity37 house the night of september 28 , 2012			1
in the explosive article , which prompted the university to shut down all @entity41 life until january , @entity1 describes how in her first semester , she was lured to the frat by a brother named ' @entity44 ' who she met working as a lifeguard at the university pool			2
she says the junior asked her out for dinner and a date function at the @entity37 fraternity , and she accepted			0
back at the house , @entity44 invited her to an upstairs bedroom , where things took a gruesome turn as she was thrown onto a glass table which shattered and then raped by seven men one after the other in what appeared to be an initiation ritual			1
when she later came to early saturday morning , @entity1 described fleeing the house barefoot and calling her new friends @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 to come find her			1
wrong : @entity1 identified @entity37 - known as @entity60 for short - as the frat house where the attack took place but told the @entity18 she only did so because a friend pointed to it a year later and told her : ' that 's where it happened			1
' her father said she had got the detail wrong perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the article is how @entity1 describes the trio 's reaction to seeing her bleeding and in shock			2
shaken by the events , she waits as the three discuss whether to report the rape to police , speaking about how it would impact their social lives , the boys ' plans to pledge a fraternity and @entity1 's college reputation			2
but in separate interviews with the @entity18 , all three refute this cold description of their behavior			0
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 say they found @entity1 crying and clearly traumatized , saying her date drove her back to his fraternity , asked her to come inside and then forced her to perform oral sex on five men			1
horrified by the story , the three say they urged @entity1 to report the incident to police , but that she declined and asked to go back to her dorm where two of them spent the night comforting her			1
' i mean obviously we were very concerned for her , ' @entity16 told the @entity18			2
' we tried to be as supportive as we could be			0
' they also added that @entity1 did not appear to be injured , despite her account that she was bleeding significantly from being thrown through a glass table			1
further , they also had doubts about her attacker			0
this past week , @entity1 finally named the lifeguard who took her back to the frat to her new friends , but when a reporter gave @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 that name , they said they had never heard of it before			1
@entity5 officials also found the name suspect , saying that no one with that name has ever attended the school			0
the @entity18 interviewed a man with a similar name , and he admitted to working at the pool with her , he says he never met her in person and was not a member of @entity128			0
the fraternity released a separate statement saying no @entity128 brother was working at the aquatic center at that time and that they did n't hold an official social event on the weekend in question			0
at the time , @entity1 's friends were under the impression that her date was a junior she met through her chemistry class that year			2
@entity1 started talking about this mystery man when @entity14 rebuffed her romantic advances , wanting to stay friends			1
when she revealed that an older student in her chemistry class had been asking her out on dates , the three friends say they took his number from her phone out of curiosity and started texting the stranger			0
the person they talked to wrote about ' this super smart hot ' freshman and how they both shared of a love of the band @entity155 , according to the two - year - old messages shown to the @entity18			0
' i really like this girl , ' the guy said in one message			0
he also sent pictures of himself , showing he had a distinct jawline and blue eyes			0
but the messages also hinted at @entity1 's crush on @entity14 , since the student wrote that she was interested in someone else and refused to date her			1
' get this she said she likes some other 1st year guy who dosnt ( sp ) like her and turned her down but she wont date me cause she likes him			0
she cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it , ' the older student wrote			0
eventually , @entity1 told her friends that she succumbed and accepted a date from the older student for friday , september 28 , 2012			1
adding even more mystery to the already confusing story , the @entity18 identified the man in the text messages from his pictures , and it turns out he went to high school with @entity1 in northern @entity186			2
however , that man , now a junior at a school in a different state , says he ' never really spoke with her ' , did not attend @entity5 , was not a member of any fraternity and had n't been to @entity192 in at least six years			0
on the specific weekend when @entity1 said she was raped , he was at an athletic event in a different state , and the pictures of him that were messaged to @entity1 's friends appear to have been pulled from his social media accounts			2
@entity1 's friends also had a hard time finding her crush on social media , adding that they never met him in person and now fear they had never been messaging with him in the first place			2
while they are skeptical of details of the night described in the @entity2 article , they all agree that something happened to leave @entity1 terrified			1
' she had very clearly just experienced a horrific trauma , ' @entity14 said			2
' i had never seen anybody acting like she was on that night before and i really hope i never have to again			0
... if she was acting on the night of sept. 28 , 2012 , then she deserves an @entity210			1
both @entity14 and @entity16 say they 've been interviewed by the @entity212 , who were asked by the university to start an investigation into the alleged incident			1
@entity2 has issued an apology for the story , initially saying their trust in @entity1 was ' misplaced '			1
they have stopped commenting on the article , while conducting an internal review			0
on wednesday , the lawyer representing @entity1 asked reporters to stop contacting her and her family			0
' as i am sure you all can understand , all of this has been very stressful , overwhelming and retraumatizing for @entity1 and her family , ' @entity1 's lawyer @entity227 said .			0
