@entity0 are on the brink of signing @entity2 after they launched a shock £ 4million bid for the @entity7 striker			1
@entity8 is determined to add depth to his squad but the move for boyhood @entity11 fan @entity2 has come from left field			1
the initial £ 4m fee will rise according to the appearances he makes			1
@entity2 , who began his career at @entity0 ’s academy , will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy summer for the club			1
he could even be followed by two of his team - mates from @entity26 , as @entity0 are still negotiating for £ 30m - rated @entity38 and have also targeted @entity39 to bolster their defence			1
odds on : a flurry of bets had been placed on @entity2 joining @entity0 on thursday appearances / goals 1998 – 2000 @entity46 3 0 2001 – 2002 @entity47 44 8 2002 – 2005 @entity48 98 18 2005 – 2006 @entity49 64 28 2006 – 2009 @entity50 128 51 2009 – @entity26 207 106 they have also bid £ 16million for @entity52 left - back @entity51 and could send @entity54 midfielder @entity53 in the opposite direction to complete that deal , as @entity8 looks to bring in the numbers they will need to cope with competing in the @entity59 and the @entity60			1
@entity51 , who has been watched by both @entity62 clubs , is @entity0 's number one target to strength a position that has given @entity8 problems in the last 12 months			1
@entity38 's move has been held up by the fact @entity70 are owed a 25 per cent sell - on fee and @entity0 have @entity73 's @entity72 as alternative			1
@entity75 , the @entity76 under - 21 international , is another target and @entity0 remain in talks with him over a £ 12million move from @entity81			1
ambition : @entity2 will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy period for @entity0 on the move : @entity26 striker @entity2 is on the brink of a £ 4million move to @entity0 happy days : @entity2 's sister @entity90 revealed family joy although the tweet was no longer available later yet it is the deal for @entity2 – who was released by @entity0 when he was 15 famously worked in a beetroot factory – that has come as such surprise but @entity8 has always been a fan			1
' i think @entity2 is a terrific player , ' said @entity8 last september before @entity0 faced @entity26 at @entity99			1
' i sent him a message , a fax , when he made his @entity7 debut ( against @entity103 ) as i know he is a @entity104			1
i sent it on behalf of the club and all @entity107			2
' he is a @entity108 boy and i was just wishing him well , saying we were all proud of him playing for @entity7			1
' @entity110 : @entity0 are still in talks with @entity26 for £ 30million - rated @entity38 @entity8 added : ' people look back now and say it was a mistake ( to let @entity2 go ) , but there may have been something at the time that was a factor			1
' he just might not have been ready for what @entity0 was at that time , but there is absolutely no doubt within development it can not just be about what the player is now			0
with young talent you always have to look at what they could be			0
' you see so many young @entity129 players who are thrown to the garbage because maybe they are not strong or they are not quick when they are going through growth spurts			0
the emphasis at younger ages should be technique			0
but i have been a big admirer of @entity2			1
' interest : @entity0 have also bid £ 16million for @entity52 left - back @entity51 ( right ) @entity2 worked for four months in a factory putting lids on beetroot jars when he was released by @entity46 in 2000 before going on to play for @entity47 and @entity48			1
his incredible rise to fame began when @entity49 boss @entity142 moved him from midfield			0
@entity142 recalled : ' i took him from @entity48 for not much and shoved him straight up front			0
career move : @entity2 's incredible rise happened after he was shoved up front at @entity49 ' first and foremost he was a big lad			2
i noticed he had a terrific shot and he was good in the air , either playing off someone or being a target man			0
' i did n't think he 'd come good in midfield , but he had exceptional touch and ability			0
he can see a move two or three passes before it happens so he 's always one step ahead			0
he always had the ability to play up front but his midfield mindset makes him good at dropping off			0
' @entity2 , aged 23 at the time , forged a formidable partnership with @entity162 and they scored 27 goals in 24 matches before @entity162 was poached by @entity166			2
but it got @entity2 noticed , too , by @entity50 director of football @entity168			2
after one season he moved there for £ 200,000			2
hitman : @entity2 continued his fine form at @entity50 , scoring one in every two games ' it took four months to get him fit , ' said @entity168 , now assistant manager at @entity177			2
' he had all sorts of different little ailments , minor things			0
after we got him fit - boom			2
' we always knew he could score			0
he strikes the ball so powerfully and he knows how to use his body , he 's a clever player			0
he 's a great lad			0
unassuming , terrific , never arrogant			0
just a bloody good lad and very popular			0
' @entity26 signed him for £ 1million in 2009 and he has been top scorer every season since .			2
