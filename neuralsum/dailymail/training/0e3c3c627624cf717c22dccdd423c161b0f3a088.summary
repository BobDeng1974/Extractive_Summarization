former two - weight world champion @entity0 claimed his legal battle with @entity2 had ' seriously affected ' his boxing after the case ended with both sides declaring victory			1
@entity0 , who is managed by @entity7 , was ordered to pay @entity2 unpaid commission over a manager agreement following a @entity11 hearing			1
but the judge ruled that @entity2 was not entitled to anything for the @entity15 's decision to end their promoter agreement despite claiming lost profits of at least £ 1.8million			1
the judge , mr @entity19 , also ruled that @entity21 owed @entity0 £ 102,000 purse money but said the @entity24 fighter was unlikely to receive a penny from the liquidated company			0
@entity0 said that his legal battle with @entity2 ' seriously affected ' his boxing @entity0 joined @entity28 's @entity27 on march 11 , 2013 , amid frustration over two postponed fights and unpaid earnings from his @entity33 lightweight win over @entity34 in september 2012			1
after two unconvincing defences , he lost his title to the classy @entity37 and has failed to impress in his comeback fights			0
in a statement , @entity0 said : ' the pressure that this case has put on me over the last 18 months has been immense and seriously affected me in and out of the ring			0
' the written judgement stated that the judge would decide how much @entity0 owed @entity2 for the management fees if the figure was not agreed			1
@entity27 claimed the figure was £ 73,000 while @entity2 described the amount as ' substantial '			0

' however , @entity0 has vowed to pursue that sum with the @entity62 , with @entity27 calling for the promoter 's licence to be suspended			2
' i will now be actively pursuing the @entity62 and @entity2 to make sure that my outstanding fight purse gets paid in full , ' the 31 - year - old said			0
@entity2 's claim for £ 1.8million damages was described as ' fanciful ' by the judge , who said that any lost profit would have been less than the amount owed to @entity0 for the @entity34 fight			2
