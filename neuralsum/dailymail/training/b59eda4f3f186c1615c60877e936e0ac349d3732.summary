spectators with guide dogs were told yesterday that they could not be guaranteed their chosen seats at @entity10 venues			1
the warning came after @entity77 was forced to move by a ‘ stroppy ’ official when he attended last week ’s opening ceremony with his guide dog , @entity81			2
the former home secretary , 65 , said he was made to sit in an ‘ exposed , blustery gantry ’ rather than his reserved spot			2

we are confident that it wo n’t occur again			0
’ the trio of @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 were eventually preferred and justified their selection by winning gold in a world record time			1
but @entity6 wasted no time dwelling on the disappointment of being unable to join @entity211 blade runner @entity210 in the elite club of athletes who have represented their country in both the @entity10 and @entity13			1
