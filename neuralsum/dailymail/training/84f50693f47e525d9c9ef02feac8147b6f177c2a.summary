@entity0 , 86 , was admitted to @entity2 hospital after a fall			1
he was put on the @entity3 and had his food and fluids removed for several days a woman has spoken of her heartbreak after her father died - she believes after being put on @entity3			1
@entity0 , 86 , was admitted to @entity2 hospital after a fall			1
but for several days mr @entity0 , a diabetic , had his food , drink and some of his medication removed , his stepdaughter claims			1
@entity12 was told her father had been put on the @entity3 in a bid to let his body focus on medication to make his final days as comfortable as possible			1
but ms @entity12 , 65 , was furious that doctors had n't asked for permission to put him on the pathway and demanded he be taken off it			2
after 20 hours of discussions , doctors agreed to restore his food and drink			0
but by then it was too late and his body gave up the fight , his feet turning back			0
he died just 17 hours later on august 25 last year			2
ms @entity12 said it took her months to come to terms with her father 's loss and it was only when she heard of similar cases where people were put on the @entity3 without consent that she felt she could n't hold back her anger any more			1
last month a major review was announced into the @entity3 , by the @entity41			1
the group , which represents 1,000 doctors who work in hospices and specialist hospital wards , will ' identify and explore concerns ' over the system of caring for patients in their final days			1
the review comes as several families have said their loved ones were put on the pathway without their consent			0
speaking from her home in @entity55 , @entity56 , ms @entity12 claimed @entity58 doctors had robbed her father 's right to live			0
mr @entity0 's daughter @entity12 ( right ) said her father had begged for water and his cracked lips showed he was severely dehydrated the retired shop manageress said : ' it was dreadful , he was taken into the hospital because he had a couple of falls and at first he was put on the drip			1
' but then after a number of days he was suddenly taken off it and he was just begging for a drink , saying " i 'm so thirsty "			2
' ' we asked the doctors why he was taken off his drip and we were told he was on the @entity3			1
' we did n't even know what is was , there 's no way that should have happened without asking us			0
' we kicked up a fuss and demanded he be put back on his medication , and eventually they agreed about 20 hours later			0
' but mr @entity0 , a former miner , died within 24 hours as his body was unable to recover from his frail state , his family claim			1
although the great - great - grandfather - of - one was surrounded by ms @entity12 and his other daughter @entity91 when he passed away , it was an uncomfortable end to his life , they say			2
ms @entity12 added : ' he was left dying there for 17 hours until the inevitable happened			0
no one should have to see their loved one needlessly die like that in front of them			0
' you would n't even make a dog die like that , he was just left to die on his own - none of the doctors came in to check on his condition , in the end we were dabbing a damp cloth over his cracked lips			1
' my granddaughter had a camera with her and she took a few photos of him when his feet turned black - it was so distressing			0
' after 20 hours of discussions with the family , doctors agreed to restore mr @entity0 's drip , but his feet began to turn black and he died shortly afterwards she said : ' our dad wanted to live , the nurse even said " you want to live , do n't you @entity0 " , but the doctors denied him that right			1
' we do n't want anyone else to suffer what we have suffered			0
my father was a character and a very caring person , he looked after my mother in her final years when she had cancer - he did n't deserve what happened to him			2
' he was on a lot of medication , but he was living at home , he was able to look after himself with the aid of a care worker from the council			0
' he was fully aware of what was going on around him and he was happy			0
he should have lived a lot longer			0
' @entity140 , director of integrated care and partner services at @entity142 and @entity143 said although they could not comment mr @entity0 's case until an official complaint was received from his family , she insisted they always consult families before proceeding with the @entity3			1
she said : ' the @entity3 is an end - of - life care plan to ensure that patients in the last few days of life receive the quality of care needed			1
' the patient 's condition is continually monitored in order to assess the patient 's needs and to provide support to their relatives or carers			0
' communication with patients and their families is central to end - of - life care			0
the @entity3 does not preclude the use of clinically assisted ( artificial ) hydration or nutrition and all clinical decisions are made with the patient 's best interest and comfort in mind			2
' a former version of the article described the @entity3 as “ a withdrawal of food and fluids ”			2
we are happy to make clear that the @entity3 is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment and the needless prolonging of life			2
once a patient is no longer able to eat or drink , consideration is given as to whether fluids and nutrients should continue to be provided .			0
