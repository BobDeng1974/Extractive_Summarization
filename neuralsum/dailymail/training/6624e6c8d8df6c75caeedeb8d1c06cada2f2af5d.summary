by @entity0 in most office romances , the torrid details do n’t usually travel much further than the water cooler			0
alas , as @entity6 can testify , the steel - and - glass @entity4 in @entity5 is n’t like most offices , and her married lover , multibillionaire @entity9 founder @entity8 , is n’t like most bosses			1
so rather than remaining under wraps in @entity12 , news of their relationship has ended up all over the internet – and for that , the 27 - year - old @entity18 pupil may have @entity8 ’s wife @entity20 to thank			1
for the way the story of miss @entity6 ’s romance with 40 - year - old @entity8 – one of the world ’s richest men , with a £ 15billion fortune – came out is rather intriguing			1
the face of @entity29 : @entity6 , the 27 - year - old marketing manager for @entity9 's computerised spectacles , whose relationship with @entity9 co-founder @entity8 exploded into public attention this week split : @entity8 , 40 , pictured with his wife @entity20 , also 40			1
one of the journalists who broke the story for @entity39 technology website @entity38 is the partner of a @entity9 executive who is a close friend of miss @entity20 the relationship was first revealed in an article on @entity39 technology website @entity45 of the reporting on the piece was carried out by the site ’s co-executive editor , @entity48			1
miss @entity48 ’s partner is @entity51 , a @entity9 executive who is a close friend of @entity52 , 40			1
on top of that , @entity53 works at a division of the search engine giant dedicated to products including @entity9 glass – which miss @entity6 promotes			1
on the same day , the website published a story about the departure of high - flying @entity9 executive @entity63			1
marketing manager @entity64 dated mr @entity63 shortly before her romance with @entity8 began			2
this week , he left the company to join a phone firm in @entity68			0
his departure followed ‘ a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another @entity74 , ’ @entity38 reported			0
model looks : a carefully posed picture of @entity64 taken from her publicly shared @entity78 profile page where 's the @entity29 : she holds a sandwich instead in the spot over her eye where the gadget would sit in the wake of this rather complicated love ‘ quadrangle ’ , no doubt employees inside @entity9 are taking a rather wry look at the firm ’s code of conduct			1
it states : ‘ if a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved			0
‘ when faced with a potential conflict of interest , ask yourself : would this activity harm my reputation , negatively impact my ability to do my job at @entity9 or potentially harm @entity9 ? ‘ would this activity embarrass @entity9 or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog ? if the answer to any of these questions is “ yes ” , the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it			1
’ yesterday it was reported that miss @entity6 had been transferred to another department within @entity9 ‘ to be even further from @entity8 in the chain of command ’			1
confusingly , another report quoted a @entity9 spokesman saying she had not moved and ‘ remains in her current position ’			2
either way , she has gone to ground and has not been answering calls			0
famous friends : miss @entity6 with @entity130 , a @entity129 rap artist noted for his choices of spectacles it 's not all work : miss @entity6 on the beach in one of numerous photos she has shared over the internet but thanks to her eagerness to embrace social networking sites , we know rather a lot about miss @entity6			1
according to posts on her blog , she was born in @entity146 and raised in @entity147			0
she refers to herself as a ‘ @entity148 ’ – a ‘ @entity149 ’			0
her mother is from @entity146 , her father is @entity129			0
she boarded at £ 31,000 - a - year @entity152 with @entity153 and @entity154 and princess @entity155 , and has worked for @entity9 since she graduated with a communications degree from @entity157			2
she was initially based in @entity147 , before moving to @entity158 to work at its @entity12 nerve centre last year			0
she has since been promoting @entity29 , glasses which enable users to film and broadcast everything they see – to the concern of privacy campaigners			0
her social networking pages are filled with photographs of her modelling the glasses , and one shows her meeting rapper @entity130			0
in another , rather oddly , she is wearing a mask from the film @entity171 and holding a @entity173 toy			0
in disguise : miss @entity6 wears an @entity176 mask , left ; and right , she hides behind a wearable cushion if she ends up at the centre of what could be the most expensive divorce in history , she might need some superpowers of her own			1
the precise timings and possible overlaps of her romance with @entity8 are not clear			2
it has been confirmed that @entity8 and his wife , who have a four - year - old son and eight - year - old daughter , separated several months ago			2
but whether miss @entity6 was the catalyst for the split is , naturally , subject to much speculation			2
neither @entity8 or miss @entity20 has filed for divorce – yet			2
if they divorce , @entity5 law suggests their fortune would have to be halved			0
to complicate matters , however , they have reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement			0
even if that falls through , @entity8 and miss @entity6 would hardly be short of cash – they would still have £ 7.5billion to get by on .			1

story was first broken by partner of close friend of @entity8 's wife
it told how @entity8 , 40 , had begun affair with @entity6 , 27
separate story told how @entity6 's *ex-partner* had left @entity9
relationship appears to fly in the face of @entity9 's ' code of conduct '
