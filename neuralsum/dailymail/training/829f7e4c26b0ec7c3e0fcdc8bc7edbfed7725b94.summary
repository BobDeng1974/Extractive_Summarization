with his big blue eyes and beautiful grin , @entity0 was his parents ’ pride and joy			2
but tragedy was to strike just weeks after the infant ’s first birthday when his devastated mother and father found him dead in his cot			1
desperate to know why @entity15 had been a victim of sudden infant death syndrome ( @entity18 ) , parents @entity12 , 37 , and @entity14 , 33 , volunteered his dna for a pioneering genetic test			1
and in what could be a significant breakthrough for other families , medics discovered a rare gene mutation that causes the heart to beat irregularly			1
the findings will now be investigated in depth to try and unlock the mystery surrounding the sudden deaths of almost 300 @entity32 babies each year			2
@entity14 and @entity12 , 33 and 37 , were distraught when their one - year - old son @entity15 passed away unexpectedly last year doctors told @entity35 and mrs @entity36 had died of sudden infant death syndrome - the name given to unexplained baby deaths , or cot death mrs @entity41 went to check on her son at 8:45pm on may 30 last year and found him unresponsive			1
he was rushed to hospital but was found dead on arrival doctors warn that the discovery may not herald the arrival of an overall ‘ gene for cot death ’ , but could provide an explanation in some cases			1
mr @entity0 , a director of a recycling firm , said it was vital that they found out exactly why @entity15 died			1
‘ cot death is a term used to describe what happened , but not a reason why , ’ he said			1
‘ if what the doctors have discovered from @entity15 can help just one other family understand why their baby died then it will be fantastic – part of his legacy			2
’ an inquest this week in @entity68 , @entity69 , was told how miss @entity14 found 13 - month - old @entity15 not breathing when she checked on him in bed in may last year			1
desperate to find out how their son died , @entity35 and mrs @entity41 entered his dna into an @entity75 test , which revealed he had a genetic heart condition never seen before in a child			1
he is pictured on holiday with his mother mr @entity0 says the inquest - which ruled @entity15 died from natural causes - gave him and his wife ' closure '			1
he said : ' it was such a relief to finally get an answer ' despite a neighbour ’s attempts to resuscitate the tot , he was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital			0
a post-mortem examination failed to provide an explanation , so the couple agreed to specialist genetic testing that has only been available on the @entity75 for around 12 months			0
dr @entity95 , a consultant geneticist at @entity96 in @entity69 , discovered that @entity15 had a mutation in one of his genes – @entity101 – seen in just a handful of previous cases			2
parents suffer the agony of about 270 sudden or unexplained infant deaths in the @entity32 each year			0
the majority – eight out of ten – occur before babies reach one year old			0
according to recent statistics boys are most at risk , accounting for almost two thirds of cases in 2012			0
the rate is also three times higher among lower birth weight babies			0
however , deaths have fallen by around 65 per cent since the launch of a campaign in the early 1990s that included advice such as making sure babies sleep on their backs and warning against sharing a bed with a newborn , especially if parents are smokers or had been drinking			0
the exact cause is largely unknown , although researchers in @entity129 last year established a link to breathing problems			2
a study in @entity133 found brain ‘ swelling ’ in some cases			0
defects can lead to an irregular heartbeat known as known as arrhythmia and in some cases it is fatal			0
dr @entity95 told the hearing the finding was a ‘ significant breakthrough ’ for @entity15 ’s family			2
but she warned it may not be ‘ the answer for everyone ’ because lifestyle factors were also important			0
coroner @entity151 recorded a verdict of natural causes			0
mr @entity0 said : ' it was such a relief to finally get an answer			2
' you get through the day protecting your child from sticking their fingers in plug sockets and eating things they should n't and then you put them in what should be the safest place - bed			0
' i was worried that @entity15 's death would be ruled as unascertained or cot death and that is unacceptable to me			1
' since @entity15 's death , we have been wondering if we did anything wrong			1
' but we knew in our heart of hearts that there is nothing we could have done , even if we were trained doctors			0
' the inquest has brought closure and helped us to realise that we did nothing wrong			0
' mrs @entity41 , a full - time mother , added : ' it was definitely the outcome that we wanted			1
' @entity15 's death could help shed light on the causes of cot death , which kills 600,000 babies a year in the @entity32 , experts said			1
his parents have set up a charity in his name the court heard that @entity15 was found unresponsive at 8.45pm on may 30 last year after mrs @entity41 went to check on him in his cot an hour and a half after putting him to sleep			1
area coroner for @entity192 , @entity151 , said : ' @entity15 appeared to be fine in the morning though a bit jumpy			2
it was not felt that there was anything particularly alarming			0
' that evening he was given a bath and was put to bed where he seemed to settle			0
ms @entity151 added : ' at about 8.45pm it was quite quiet and @entity14 went to check on him and realised he was not breathing			2
she felt there were no apparent signs of life so she put him back into the cot and contacted neighbours			0
' a neighbour carried out resuscitation while @entity15 's distraught parents waited for paramedics to arrive			1
@entity15 was rushed to @entity213 but was pronounced dead on arrival			2
the court heard that although he needed an operation for a large hernia , he had otherwise been a happy , healthy baby with very loving parents			0
a post-mortem examination was carried out but no cause of death could be ascertained , so further specialised tests were carried out including to see if there were any bacterial or viral infections present in @entity15 's body			1
these also drew a blank , as did biochemistry and toxicology tests			0
sudden infant death syndrome - or cot death - is the term used to describe the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained			1
the paediatrician on call the night @entity15 died suggested they could send him for a molecular autopsy – a dna test for genes related to heart disease that is sometimes carried out after unexplained deaths			1
so scientists arranged for the test to be carried out at @entity96 in @entity69			0
mr @entity0 said he hoped @entity15 's case could help others			1
he said : ' i hope that one day he will help provide answers to other families who find themselves in this awful situation ' it was there that doctors discovered @entity15 had the mutation in the @entity101 gene			1
this type of mutation is often associated with abnormal heart rhythms , which could have caused @entity15 's death			1
dr @entity95 , clinical consultant geneticist at the hospital , who discovered the crucial change in @entity15 's genes , said : ' it is a significant breakthrough for that family			1
' the study into that gene has added to the knowledge that we have already gained			0
' however there are variations in each person so it is not necessarily the answer for everyone			0
' she added : ' this was found more likely to occur at night and with a fever which is what features here			0
it is quite likely to be relevant to @entity15 's death			1
' coroner ms @entity151 said : ' he had a genetic deficiency that brought about an abnormal heart rhythm and that 's why @entity15 died			1
' from the evidence that fits very well with the clinical picture			0
this kind of investigation is in its infancy and there is still a great deal of research to be done but what dr @entity95 was able to say was that overall cause of death was natural			0
' i would not normally accept cardiac arrhythmia as cause of death but i am minded to accept that explanation because everything else has been ruled out			0
' sudden infant death syndrome describes the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained			2
cot death was a term commonly used in the past			2
it has largely been abandoned , due to misleading suggestions that sudden infant death can only occur when a baby is asleep in a cot			2
causes of @entity18 may include accidents , infections , congenital abnormality or metabolic disorder			0
for those deaths that remain unexplained , experts believe there are likely to be undiscovered causes			0
sids statistics : source : the @entity329 and @entity330 her conclusion was that death was from natural causes			0
she added : ' none of us expect it to happen and it is every parent 's nightmare			0
' afterwards , mr @entity0 thanked all the doctors , paramedics and police officers who had helped them during the tragedy			2
he said @entity15 had ' brought pure joy to everybody '			2
mrs @entity41 is now 32 weeks pregnant , but faces an agonising wait to see if the new baby has the same mutated gene that killed @entity15			1
there is a 50 per cent chance that the child will have the same mutation but – as the test can not be carried out while the baby is still developing - the couple will not find out until birth			1
mr @entity0 said : ' if we discover that the baby does have the condition we can treat it with medication or surgery to fit a defibrillator			2
' the science behind it all is exciting but very much in its infancy			0
' around 600 babies die every year from cot death and it 's far too many so i hope we can help prevent that with our findings			1
' even after @entity15 's death , my sense of pride has just got stronger and i hope that one day he will help provide answers to other families who find themselves in this awful situation			1
' mr and mrs @entity41 have launched a small charity in their son 's name , @entity380 , to raise £ 15,000 for sensory equipment that stimulates children 's senses .			1

@entity0 died in his sleep last year , shorty after his first birthday
@entity388 , 37 and @entity14 , 33 , were told their son died of cot death
a dna test found he had a gene mutation associated with heart problems
this may have caused his death but has never been seen before in a child
experts said breakthrough could shed new light on the cause of cot death
mrs @entity41 is now 32 weeks pregnant and is waiting to find out if the baby has the same gene mutation that is thought to have caused @entity15 's death
