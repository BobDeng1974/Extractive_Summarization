you put in the right amount of everything and it 's delicious			2
' she also works out with @entity59 , the man behind the hugely successful @entity61 empire			2

' what i 've learned through working with @entity59 is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things , faster than i ever thought possible			2
oh , and by the way , nobody can get a stomach as flat as @entity59 can ! ' staying in shape for summer : @entity4 swears by the power of all things green and works out with celebrity trainer @entity59 @entity79 words : sharing her life advice in a recent interview , the @entity81 - born beauty said : ' keep your wits about you			1
say no if something makes you feel uncomfortable			0
have goals and go after them , and practice good manners ' aside from her modelling duties , @entity4 has been spending a lot of time with long - term boyfriend @entity93			1
proving that they are stronger than ever , the lovebirds stepped out for a romantic dinner on sunday evening			0

the in - demand model recently covered the june issue of @entity103 , in which she opened up about her idol			0
she always strikes me as the ultimate femme fatale , ' she gushed			0
as we 're used to seeing her : @entity4 modelling her first ever lingerie collection called ' @entity110 ' designed in partnership with @entity3 super smoothie : the model often uploads snaps of herself slurping on smoothies and juices , which she describes as ' the perfect way to start the day ' keep your wits about you			1
say no if something makes you feel uncomfortable			0

' @entity4 , who has one of showbiz 's most enviable figures , recently praised her ‘ delicious green juice ' which she described as ' a great way to start the day			1
' but what ’s behind this mysterious concoction ? along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber , kale and parsley , the @entity145 wholefood @entity146 is added to the juice			2
and it ’s not just @entity4 who ’s caught the @entity155 bug , @entity152 has admitted that she takes @entity157 supplements to keep her skin in check			1
green vegetable smoothie @entity161 , who ’s a nutritionist and green food expert at @entity157 , has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie ...			2
' with everyone from @entity4 to @entity167 drinking green smoothies recently , you ’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad			1
' we all know that we ’re probably not eating enough greens , yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			0
@entity180 smoothies can be high in vitamin @entity181 , which can help reduce tiredness , and magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			1
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity145 wholefood @entity146 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity181 content as a 32oz steak			0
perhaps most importantly , these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy , this is hugely important			0
smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates			0
we recommend the @entity225 of blenders , the @entity228 blender , as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh , whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients			0
it also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once			2
' @entity152 and @entity4 ’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious , simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			1
combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible			0
juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens ( sprouts ) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy			2
just juice : @entity4 has revealed that she loves @entity157 ( like those pictured right ) green juices juicing or blending any raw green vegetable , especially the living leafy varieties , is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues			1
@entity265 maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems			0
@entity180 smoothies containing the ingredients seen in @entity4 and @entity152 ’s can be high in vitamin @entity181 , which can help reduce tiredness			1
the spinach in @entity4 ’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			1
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity145 wholefood @entity146 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity181 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin d in particular is important for winter , as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight , and long cold winters can cause @entity299 to become deficient , meaning it ’s important to top up where possible			0
to make a @entity4 or @entity152 style green smoothie , try the delicious recipe below at home			1
freshly juiced fruits should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar content			0
blend the below ingredients , adding the water first			0
