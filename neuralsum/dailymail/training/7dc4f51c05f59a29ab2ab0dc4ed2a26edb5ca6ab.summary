it sounds like a plot lifted from a sci - fi disaster movie			0
a @entity4 scientist has said a @entity6 - era ballistic missile system dubbed ' @entity7 ' should be put back into use defending the earth from asteroids			1
senior rocket researcher @entity12 - who spoke out after a meteor burst over @entity4 's @entity14 earlier this year damaging thousands of buildings - said the old 1960s missiles were ideally suited to destroying any potential threats streaking towards the planet from space			1
back in use ? the scientist suggested the old @entity6 - era @entity21 missiles should be put back to work protecting the earth from meteorites threat : the researcher said the missiles - named @entity7 by @entity27 - were well suited to ' fighting suddenly discovered small [ space ] objects ' powerful : the meteor left a 50 - foot hole in the frozen surface of a lake as it crashed down in @entity4 's @entity34 region mr @entity12 , from the @entity35 , highlighted the havoc caused when the meteor burst over the @entity14 on february 15 , leaving around 1,200 people injured			1
it created a sonic boom that shattered windows and damaged thousands of buildings around the city of @entity34			2
' well - suited ' : the @entity6 - era missiles could intercept a falling missile with a mere 20 minutes ' warning , mr @entity12 claimed the researcher said the missiles , which use standard liquid fuel based on hydrazine , were ' well - suited ' to fighting ' suddenly discovered small [ space ] objects , according to a report on news.com.au			1
he pointed out that the missiles could be kept poised and ready to launch for up to a decade			0
it means a missile could be launched against an approaching asteroid with a mere 20 minutes warning , in contrast to modern missile systems , which require several days of preparation ahead of a launch			0
hurtling from space : the missiles could intercept a meteorite like the one that streaked across the sky over @entity34 in february before it crashed into the earth , the scientist has claimed defence : the scientist referred to the meteor that streaked across the skies over @entity4 's @entity14 earlier this year , causing sharp explosions damage : the exploding meteorite left the roof of this zinc factory in @entity4 's @entity78 in ruins scientists claimed the meteorite that exploded over the @entity14 was the biggest space rock to hit earth in more than a century			1
the enormous meteorite weighed an estimated 100,000 tons and measured around 55ft in diameter			0
mr @entity12 claimed @entity7 missiles would be capable of destroying objects with a diameter of up to around 300ft			0
if equipped with a booster , the 1960s missile would be able to destroy a space object hurtling towards earth while it was still five to six hours away , he said			2
@entity7 missiles can be used for destroying small space objects with a diameter of up to 100 meters threatening the @entity95 , if the missile is equipped with the third stage			0
if reequipped with a booster , the missile will be able to destroy space objects five - six hours before their collision with the @entity95 , he said .			2
