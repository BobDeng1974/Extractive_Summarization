by @entity0 not quite a cricket score at the home of @entity4 rugby but , nonetheless , the kind of emphatic , seemingly effortless victory that @entity7 would have coveted so greatly as he made his ‘ home ’ bow as @entity11 manager			1
a new boss and an alien venue was a potentially lethal combination for @entity11 as they attempted to move closer to a third successive qualification for the group stages			2
yet this was as assured a performance as their supporters could have wished for under the circumstances			0
as a consequence , the new man on the bridge already has a degree of wind in his sails			0
@entity30 tests undoubtedly lie in wait for the @entity32 and his players in the coming weeks than a @entity35 side that lacked any semblance of belief they would pull off a highly - improbable aggregate comeback			0
however , that should n’t detract from a proficient , ruthless display by the @entity4 champions that hinted at much more to come			0

whether it ’s @entity100 or @entity101 ’s who next roll up in @entity103 , the @entity99 experience will hold no fears now for @entity7 ’s men			1
it might not be home but nor should it be seen as detrimental to their chances of reaching the group stages either			2
last night ’s perfunctory victory was as much a psychological exercise as a physical one			0
the issue over the stadium and its hybrid surface will surely now barely be worthy of a mention when they regroup there in a fortnight ’s time for what ’s likely to be their last visit			0
by the time they had eased their way into the third qualifying round by a combined five - goal margin , all concerns over the switch of venue suddenly seemed rather absurd			1
lingering worries over the change of manager will naturally remain until more arduous hurdles are cleared - but the positivity that has surrounded the former @entity138 man from the first minute he landed in @entity4 shows no sign of abating			2
the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation his side shaped with a week ago was again in evidence and it permitted his side to control the match from the first whistle until the last with fluency and zest			2
it was n’t the first time @entity11 had played a ‘ home ’ tie in @entity152 on alien territory , although few among the 36,000 crowd would have witnessed the famous slaying of @entity157 at @entity158 in the 1970 @entity160 semi-final			1
@entity161 : @entity11 's fans cheer their side on during the comprehensive win at @entity99 change of venue : return leg was held at @entity99 with @entity167 being used for @entity168 decent voice : @entity11 's fans made themselves heard as their side raced to a three - goal lead ' perfect ' pitch : the turf was relaid ahead of @entity11 's game at @entity99 , the home of @entity4 rugby at the double : @entity51 strikes again to head in @entity11 's second goal six minutes after the opener celebration : @entity69 and @entity66 congratulate @entity11 's first - half star @entity51 test : @entity11 boss @entity7 gets a feel for the pitch at @entity99 ahead of the game more than 136,000 had descended on mount @entity185 that evening – a @entity187 record that will surely never be broken – and last night ’s gathering in the east was never likely to attract more than a fraction of that number			1
@entity11 did their level best to replicate the feel of @entity167 in a stadium with 7,000 more seats than their spiritual home			1
they made a decent fist of it with hundreds of latecomers rushing from the @entity99 hostelries to applaud @entity7 as he took his place on the bench for the first time in a competitive game in @entity4 as @entity11 manager			1
there would be no quibble with the welcome afforded by their hosts			0
the @entity212 had promised a newly - laid surface fit for a @entity160 qualifier and it was that and then some			2
a combination of grass and synthetic fibres , @entity99 might well have made a late entry to host the lawn bowls at the @entity168			1
it was tailor - made for the high - intensity , passing game championed by @entity7			2
the wide expanses were a source of torment for a @entity35 side who had just about kept themselves in the tie a week ago with a compact , diligent display on home soil			0
midfield battle : @entity11 's @entity69 challenges @entity91 for the ball in the centre of the park the clicking of mobile phone cameras among the @entity240 players as they inspected the turf in their suits pre-match was a subtle indication that their ambitions did n’t stretch far beyond savouring the occasion			1
within half an hour , already three goals down on the night , you suspected the visitors had already had enough of sight - seeing in the capital			0
@entity70 ought to have beaten @entity78 when one - on - one inside five minutes but @entity45 ’s six - minute brace – with both goals springing from corners - rendered that irrelevant			1
@entity70 ’s second near thing of the evening was more down to the agility of the visiting keeper than the @entity257 ’s shortcomings but commendably he was on hand to sweep home his side ’s third moments later following @entity69 ’s cut - back			1
clinical : @entity70 slams a shot past @entity78 to make it 3 - 0 to the hosts before half - time easy peasy : @entity70 saunters over to team - mate @entity69 to celebrate @entity11 's third @entity269 , set and match : @entity70 adds a fourth after @entity78 , in purple , had raced from his goal with the match over as a contest long before @entity278 referee @entity277 brought the first half to a close , there was a degree of inevitability about @entity7 ’s men easing off a fraction in the second period			1
@entity68 twice menaced @entity78 with vicious efforts from distance that the @entity35 keeper did well to parry			0
on a night of seemingly boundless positives , @entity7 was able to hand both @entity67 and @entity64 half an hour each while @entity71 enjoyed the last 18			0
@entity71 oddly arrived on the scene to a chorus of good - natured boos – the reason being that @entity70 was going the other way at the same time seconds after side - stepping @entity78 to clinically claim his second and his side ’s fourth			2
you sense the naysayers might just forgive their new leader , however			0
set piece supremo : commons provided assists from corners for both of @entity51 's goals final game ? @entity11 goalkeeper @entity60 has been heavily linked with a move to @entity308			1

@entity11 's home leg was held at @entity99 because of the @entity168 opening *ceremony* at @entity167 on *wednesday* evening
@entity313 *defender* @entity51 opened the scoring in the 14th minute
he then doubled their lead six minutes later with a headed effort
striker @entity70 made it 3 - 0 before half - time as @entity320 *unravelled*
@entity324 striker *completed* the rout in the 71st minute with an easy finish
comfortable victory confirms @entity11 's place in the third round of qualifying for the @entity160 group stage
@entity11 will play winner of @entity101 's and @entity100 in the next round
