@entity0 has revealed that he tried to sign new @entity2 hero @entity1 on loan for @entity4 when he first took over at @entity5			1
@entity4 face @entity6 at home on sunday and @entity0 must try to find a way of stopping @entity1 whose career has rocketed since honing his skills out on loan at @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 earlier in his career			1
@entity0 was also in the queue to sign @entity1 after taking over as @entity4 manager in 2012 , and he believes that the 21 - year - old striker 's spells in the @entity22 have helped make him the player he is today			1
@entity1 at the @entity24 in @entity25 ahead of his firsts start for @entity2 ' he 's a player that most people would have had a look at when he was n't in the side at @entity6 , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's a good reflection of how the loan system can work , and it does n't have to be the glory loan – the one where it works every time			2
he 's had his ups and downs on loan but that can be a massive part of a young player 's development , experiencing the fact that it does n't always work hand in glove			0
' it 's not always perfect , you do n't play every week , you have to challenge yourself to keep going and keep grinding and be professional every day to be ready to play when you 're called upon			0
' he was out at @entity13 and it was possibly a step too early when he went out to @entity14 to play there , and then @entity15 a few bits and bobs off the bench			0
@entity1 enjoyed a phenomenal start to his international career by scoring on his debut last friday @entity1 headed home against @entity57 just 79 seconds after coming on to the field as a substitute ' all of that for a young man who seems to me to have a very good temperament and a very good desire to be a footballer , ( shows that ) if you stick at it long enough you get your rewards			2
it has to be the ups and downs of football to bring the reality			0
' @entity75 chairman @entity74 tabled a series of new proposals last week aimed at increasing the number of homegrown players in the @entity80			2
@entity4 are the only team in the top - flight to field an all - @entity83 team this season , and @entity0 believes that the only way for players like @entity1 to truly progress is to be given a chance at the highest level			1
@entity1 was sent on loan to several clubs in the lower leagues , including here at @entity13 , before he found fame the 21 - year - old striker has taken the @entity80 by storm this season with his glut of goals ' it 's not an exact science , ' he added			1
' the way the @entity75 are trying to take a grip of it is to try and crunch it down to a better chance of elite young players coming through the system , and an improved chance of them being future @entity2 players			0
' i do n't think there 's a perfect situation but they are certainly searching hard to find the best situation of allowing those players real growth			0
' but that is inevitably playing in the @entity80			2
the earlier they can get that experience to play at the top level is the best learning curve			0
