by @entity0 last updated at 9:28 am on 26th october 2011 a documentary filmmaker has revealed the nightmares he witnessed after he was arrested and interrogated by the @entity4 authorities			1
@entity5 was working for @entity6 covering the rebellion in the country when he was detained in a @entity11 cafe last week			1
he said he and his local activist contact @entity13 were blindfolded and driven at speed to a prison in the city			1
outside i could hear beatings in a neighbouring room			1
people being slapped and wailing painfully as they were being whacked			1
' mr @entity5 , from south @entity28 , was held with opponents of @entity31 's regime and described how they were treated			1
' when they are taken out of the cell they are blindfolded and their hands are tied ' , he said speaking on @entity6			1
' they are taken down the corridor to this , well , they do n't know where they are going , the whole thing , having been blindfolded for a little bit , the disorientation , of never seeing and the person you keep meeting is just a voice that you hear and you have to see him on one knee , you are forced to kneel on one knee			2
' it 's a very awkward position to be in for maybe an hour of interrogation			2
@entity5 and his activist contact were blindfolded and driven to a prison in @entity11 ( pictured ) ' if they are not satisfied with the info , you would be brought out at three in the morning into the torture chamber and whipped with the cable or there was like a hundred leather belts , like a big ball of leather belts , in the corner '			2
his account reveals an insight into how dissent is handled amid the ongoing rebellion			2
he also told of his fears for those @entity4 who had assisted him who he said are now likely targets for the regime			2
he said : ' i 'd seen these things that they 'd use , because the cable was next to my bed one night			2
' it was so heavy , it was so awful , it must have been broken bones			2
' and the howling , the noise of a human being hit with that is something that just , you know , you shiver and shake			0
' you hear a sound that you 've never heard before			0
i 've never heard before			0
' and i 've seen people dead			0
and i 've seen people dying			0
and i 've seen people decapitated , but this sound hearing a man cry , is just like , awful , there 's nothing to compare it with			0
' opponents of @entity4 president @entity31 are repeatedly targeted by @entity96 forces @entity4 protesters burn a poster of @entity4 president @entity31 , left , and his father @entity99 in april			1
despite public feeling against him , @entity31 is still in power mr @entity5 said he did not know what happened to @entity13 , and feared for the safety of others who had been helping him film			0
' i did n't realise exactly what those guys are risking until i went into that experience and my @entity109 those guys are brave			0
too brave ' , he added			0
his revelations come as @entity112 claims the @entity4 government is using hospitals in its war on dissidents			1
the human rights group says wounded patients in at least four government - run hospitals have been subjected to torture and other ill - treatment , including by medical workers.one video , aired on @entity4 state television and posted on @entity124 in april , appears to show a medic hitting an injured @entity126 like this are impossible to verify independently , because @entity4 wo nâ€™t allow @entity129 journalists into the country			1
but @entity131 of @entity112 says the evidence she has gathered is overwhelming			1
' even before i came across this video , we received consistent testimonies from wounded persons who were subjected to physical abuse at the hands of health professionals			0
and also testimonies from health professionals who are outraged by the conduct of their colleagues , ' she said			0
this video , which can be seen below , apparently to show dead and injured protestors at a private clinic in the coastal city of @entity150			0
@entity112 says the day after it was posted on @entity124 in may , government forces raided the hospital looking for an alleged armed field commander opposed to the government			1
the @entity155 says more than 2,900 people have been killed in the crackdown on anti-government protests since they began in march .			0
