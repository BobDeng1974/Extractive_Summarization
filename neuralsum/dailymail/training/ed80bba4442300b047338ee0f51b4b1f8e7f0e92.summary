the 13 - year - old became well acquainted with needles , after donating bone marrow twice to two of her sick brothers			2
it all started in 2008 when doctors found a swollen lymph node on then 2 - year - old brother @entity15 's neck			2
at first he was diagnosed with @entity18 's lymphoma , a rare cancer of the lymphatic system			0
but doctors were confounded when exactly one year later older brother @entity22 , then 6 , was diagnosed with the same form of cancer			0
a sister 's sacrifice : when she was in the second grade , @entity4 donated bone marrow to two of her brothers who were suffering from a rare genetic disorder since @entity18 's does n't run in families , doctors at @entity33 at @entity34 of @entity35 started looking for another diagnosis			1
first signs : brother @entity15 was the first to get sick in 2008 , and the then 2 - year - old was diagnosed with @entity18 's lymphoma a specialist remembered hearing about a rare genetic immune disorder called @entity44 that causes the same symptoms			1
@entity15 and @entity22 tested positive for the disease , in addition to their 2 - year - old brother @entity48			2
mother @entity50 was told that all three of her sons might need a bone marrow transplant just to survive			1
that 's when big sister @entity4 stepped up to the plate and got tested to see if she was a match for the donation			1
' i remember getting my blood tested , like sticking a needle in my arm , ' @entity4 told my @entity61			0
turns out , she was a perfect match for both @entity22 and @entity48			1
at the time , she was too young to really understand what donating bone marrow would entail , but she did n't think twice about doing it			0
' i said yes , because they 're my brothers , ' she said			0
so when she was just in the second grade , doctors at @entity68 put her to sleep and gathered bone marrow from her hip bone to give to her little brothers			2
the first time @entity48 's body resisted her cells so a year later she did the same thing again , this time sitting still for eight hours while stem cells were filtered out of her blood			2
second diagnosis : but when another brother got sick , doctors discovered that all three of the boys had @entity44 - a rare genetic disorder second time 's a charm : @entity4 had her blood tested and found she was a perfect donor for @entity22 and @entity48			1
@entity48 's immune system resisted her first donation so she donated again three years later , all three of her brothers are healthy ( a woman in @entity90 donated for @entity15 )			1
they receive weekly injections to boost their b - cell count but other than that , they 're strong enough to rough house with each other			0
@entity4 says if she had to do it again , she would and now she would n't be scared because seeing her brothers healthy is more important trumps any fear of needles			0
' it 's like a good feeling , because they 're alive because of you , ' @entity4 said			0
more important things : after her two donations , now 13 - year - old @entity4 ( right ) says she is n't afraid of needles anymore life saver : today , all three of her brothers are healthy and only need weekly immune boosts to stay that way			1

@entity22 , @entity15 and @entity111 were all diagnosed with @entity44 , a rare genetic immune disorder
doctors told their mother @entity50 that all three boys would likely need a bone marrow donation to survive
big sister @entity4 got tested and found she was a perfect match for both @entity22 and @entity48
when she was in the second grade , doctors *harvested* marrow from her hip to give to the boys
when @entity48 's immune system resisted the marrow , @entity4 donated again
three years later , all three boys are healthy and only need weekly immune boosts
