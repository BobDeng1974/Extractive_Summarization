officers from the @entity31 started investigating the teenager in january when they received information that he was attempting to obtain the poison			2

the teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at @entity20 ( pictured ) earlier this month the 16 - year - old attempted to place an order on february 6 and also suggested he would make future purchases in larger quantities			1

the dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media			1
most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines			0
the dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods , but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity			2
the @entity84 website , and its successor that were recently shut down , was used to sell drugs in exchange for @entity88			0
other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs , hacked information and credit card numbers			0
det sgt @entity94 said after the case : ' the teenager at the centre of this investigation is clearly a vulnerable , troubled young man and i hope now that this case is concluded he can get the help and support he needs to turn his life around			0
' thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies , we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller			2
' i want to reassure our communities that the @entity31 and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the ' dark web '			2
law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity			0
' i would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing			0
security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the @entity131 and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it			0
' as in this case , the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the ' dark web ' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options			2
