@entity26 provided the first goal of the @entity0 era , his header worthy of the no 9 on his back			1
in the 20th minute @entity47 hit a corner that drifted all the way to @entity46 on the left flank , with @entity26 falling to the floor in a tangle with @entity58			1
he got to his feet quickly and arrived onto @entity46 ’s cross to glance the ball in off the far post			1

@entity67 held up an imaginary substitute board			0
‘ you ’re not fit to referee , ’ was sung by the @entity23			0
@entity0 used the delay to hold a team talk , but there was little improvement from his team			0
@entity42 ’s header drew a finger - tip save from @entity57 in the final minute , but it was @entity5 who struck instead			1
