@entity2 no 1 defeats @entity0 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 in @entity4 third round @entity5 now into quarter - finals where he will face @entity7 for the first time since october 2011 one thing you can safely assume when @entity5 renews acquaintance with @entity7 is that there will be no repeat of the last two sets they played			1
strangely , that was more than two and a half years ago when the now @entity18 champion blew him away 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 in the last two sets of the @entity22 final			1
this will be on clay in the @entity26 open quarter final , something very different			2
it is the @entity29 rivalry that has ground to a standstill after three @entity31 in 2011 that saw them meet in the semi-finals , with the @entity35 emerging victorious on each occasion			0
concentrated : @entity5 returns a forehand during his victory over @entity39 resistance : @entity39 provided stiff competition for the @entity2 no 1 best wishes : a fan at the @entity4 sends her birthday greetings to @entity5 for a time on thursday it seemed that it would be @entity7 who might stand @entity5 up on this particular date , as he trailed @entity50 by a set and a break before roaring back to win 6 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1			1
the @entity55 , playing on his 27th birthday , had earlier kept his side of the bargain with a 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 victory over @entity0 ’s @entity39 in a further sign that he might be coming to the boil , albeit slowly , ahead of the @entity61 and @entity18			1
we will find out more on friday and not just about @entity5			1
by his extraordinary standards on clay @entity7 has been struggling , and again relied on his remarkable fighting powers to overcome the @entity66 , just as he had against @entity68 ’s @entity67 on wednesday night			1
@entity5 agreed that it was curious the two – who of the old ‘ @entity29 ’ are probably the closest combination in terms of friendship – had been kept apart , mainly by injuries and luck of the draw			1
' i have n't practised with him hardly at all , either , ' said @entity5			1
' i will actually be quite interested to play against him , to kind of see how is game has changed and also the things i can do to make it difficult for him , and there will be things that wo n't work against him , that ` i 'll need to change as well			0
so it might be better for me to play against him now rather than in the @entity68 or at @entity18			0
' getting into gear : @entity5 cruised home after a troublesome first set blown it : @entity39 faded after running @entity5 all the way in the first set he does not see huge signs of deterioration related to unexpected exits in @entity95 and @entity96 over recent weeks : ' no , i think the thing is the confidence			1
for example his forehand looks similar to me but it looked like he was returning pretty short this week and when he is confident he tends to return a lot deeper			0
' he has made some changes to his backhand during his career , so that might be the shot that breaks down a little more but i do n’t see major changes in his game			0
maybe he is n’t playing his best tennis at times , but he looked pretty damn good last week			0
' when i was training for three or four weeks , some days the drills and patterns of play were specific for @entity115 or @entity116 , and we would also bring in some left handers , even if they play different to @entity7			2
i could still work on the patterns of play that @entity121 and myself felt would work against him			0
the thing that is different about @entity7 is the spin he generates on his forehand , you can see the stats the amount of rotation he puts on the ball is pretty incredible			2
tough test : @entity5 will now face world no 1 @entity7 in the last eight in @entity4 in the past : @entity5 and @entity7 ( right ) last played each other in the @entity22 final in october 2011 ' that ’s the thing that takes time to get used to			1
the rest of his game is great but he does n’t serve like @entity141 , he does n’t return like @entity142 , you always have an opportunity to dictate at some point against him			0
' @entity7 is also looking forward to the test : ' i have to go on the court and be aggressive , and i need to play with a little bit more control			2
it ’s an important match for me because it ’s against one of the best players in the world after two tough days			0
' i will need to take my chances			0
if i do n’t i will be spending the weekend in @entity155			0
' @entity5 served well against @entity39 and will look to replicate that and make his opponent do plenty of running			2
an unlikely win would really park his tank on @entity7 ’s lawn or , to be more accurate , his favourite rectangle of dirt .			2
