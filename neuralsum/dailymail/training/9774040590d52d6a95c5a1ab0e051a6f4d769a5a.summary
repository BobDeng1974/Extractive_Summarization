overcome : @entity0 , seven , died in his sleep during last winter 's floods as waters rose around @entity5 home parents who suspect their seven - year - old son was killed by cyanide gas during last winter ’s floods say authorities knew there was a risk of deadly ‘ ground gas ’ at their home but did not warn them			1
@entity14 was overcome by fumes while he slept as floodwaters rose in the basement of the house during storms in february			1
his parents were taken to hospital suffering from the effects of hydrogen cyanide poisoning and his father @entity24 has been left a paraplegic due to exposure to the gas			2
now it has emerged that the @entity29 and the local council were aware of potential risks of ground gas from an old landfill site next to the @entity35 ’ riverside home			1
the @entity29 – which is responsible for regulating waste sites and dealing with floods – even installed a gas - proof membrane at a cabin it built four years ago next door to their house , but did not warn residents about the risk			2
council documents also show that as far back as 2007 planning officials knew that the ground could contain ‘ harmful substances ’ – but residents were only told if they applied for permission to alter their homes			1
the revelations are the latest twist in an eight - month battle by @entity24 and @entity55 to find the truth about their son ’s death			1
after receiving a letter of condolence from @entity63 , they met ministers last week and will meet @entity65 , the environment secretary , later this month			0
they have accused the police and authorities of a cover up , after @entity0 ’s death was attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning , supposedly caused by a faulty petrol - driven pump			1
a pathologists ’ report initially said that said the cause of death was ‘ inconclusive ’ , but after further tests , it was changed to ‘ carbon monoxide poisoning ’			0
but the couple say that is impossible as they never used the hired pump in their house			0
@entity0 ’s parents believe he must have been overcome by hydrogen cyanide released by the floods from contaminated land in an old landfill 20 yards from their home			1
scientists have told @entity93 that the deadly gas – used in the @entity96 death camps – could have come from the former landfill site behind the family ’s home , generated by water rising through the landfill soil			2
@entity0 ’s family say he would still be alive if they had been told of the danger lurking just beyond their property , a riverside home in @entity108 , @entity5			1
his death sparked panic in the early hours of february 8 as 17 residents were sent to a decontamination ward and warned that hydrogen cyanide had been detected at the home by firefighters			2
flooded : the houses in @entity108 surrounded by flood waters close to the old landfill site ( bottom left field ) tragedy : the home of @entity24 and @entity55 during the floods in february where their son , seven , died some neighbours were told they may have only 15 minutes to live			1
last night mr @entity14 said : ‘ if we had been told the land was contaminated we would have been able to protect ourselves			2
’ the company director added : ‘ to put down a gas membrane in their own property suggests the @entity29 had real concerns about ground gases such as hydrogen cyanide			2
so why did n’t they tell anyone else ? ’ inundated : the well - defended @entity29 - owned hut next to the family 's home last night the family ’s mp , @entity137 , accused the @entity29 of ‘ dragging its feet ’			1
he said : ‘ if the @entity29 had some intelligence there were gases there and used a gas membrane when they built their property , that is significant and we need to find out more information about it			0
‘ it is an appalling tragedy and we need some action			0
’ after @entity0 ’s death , police investigations focused on a petrol - driven pump the family hired to remove floodwater from the basement			1
the couple insist the pump was never switched on during the flood			0
they say the pathologist was not told to test @entity0 ’s blood for the presence of hydrogen cyanide – which disappears from the body within 48 hours			0
pollution expert dr @entity167 said : ‘ there is no reason to put down a gas membrane unless there is evidence and concern about ground gases			0
’ asked about the membrane at the hut , an @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ the local authority was satisfied our desktop study identified basic ground protection as entirely appropriate as a purely precautionary approach			0
’ in a new statement last night the @entity29 said : ' in 2010 we built the property with standard damp - proofing protection as it 's a timber structure on low - lying land			0
' our sincere sympathies continue to be with the @entity14 family and we are cooperating with the investigation fully			0
' @entity191 said : ' a desk - top study prepared by the @entity29 's consultant was submitted to the @entity194			0
it recommended basic ground gas protection as an alternative to undertaking monitoring and assessment			1
' @entity201 said : ‘ we are conducting further enquiries to establish whether there is any liability or criminal offences in respect of the hire company who provided [ the pump ] and we have submitted a file to the @entity212			0
’ more than 15,000 people have signed a petition demanding the ‘ @entity215 ’ and the family has the support of celebrities including @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			0
@entity0 would have been eight on tuesday , and his parents and their supporters are set to mark the day with a march on @entity226 ’s offices in @entity227 at 1pm			1
celebrity support : designer @entity219 ( left ) , musician @entity221 ( centre ) and actor @entity220 ( right ) have signed a petition demanding the ' truth about @entity0 ' warning : a 2007 planning condition for a nearby extension within ' 250m of a current or historical landfill site '			2
