@entity0 is the favourite to replace @entity2 on sunday night after the @entity4 manager was finally allowed to walk away from the club he stood by during the darkest days of liquidation			1
the @entity9 outfit confirmed that , just over a week on from handing in his 12 months ’ notice , they had put the head coach on gardening leave			0
assistant manager @entity14 has been put in charge ‘ until the end of the season ’ , according to the official statement , although there is a strong chance that a new man will be in place before then			1
but directors moved on sunday night to remove the ‘ lame duck coach ’ , agreeing to continue paying him the monthly instalments of his £ 750,000 salary to stay away — at least until they can finalise a settlement			0
his departure clears the path for a new man to step in above loyal lieutenant @entity14 , with @entity0 believed to be the front runner			1
@entity31 and @entity32 , like @entity0 both out of work and ready to start immediately , are also likely to be candidates			1
@entity2 ’s departure on the eve of the agm removes one potential embarrassment for a club who have declared annual losses of £ 8million — and revealed they need the same again merely to stay in business			1
@entity4 boss @entity2 looked in high spirits during saturday 's win despite recent difficulties at @entity9 putting him on gardening leave effectively silences him , too , with any public attack on the board — or embarrassing revelations about how things have been run during his time as manager — risking putting him in breach of contract , thereby weakening his claim for compensation			1
the club released a statement at 8.45pm on sunday , saying : ‘ @entity4 would like to announce that @entity2 is relinquishing his duties as manager and will serve out the remainder of his 12 - month notice period on gardening leave			1
‘ we would like to thank @entity92 for all his hard work and dedication over the last few years , but we feel it is now in the best interests of all parties to move on			1
assistant manager @entity14 will take over his duties until the end of the season			1
’ meanwhile , @entity101 ’s receding chances of launching a rival rescue bid for @entity4 appear to have hit a fresh obstacle — a potential resumption of hostilities with the @entity107 tax authorities			2
@entity109 owner @entity108 is expected to tighten his grip on the @entity9 club at monday 's @entity64 , as the board and new chief executive @entity114 — very much @entity108 ’s man in situ — outline plans for the @entity118 tycoon to underwrite the £ 8m share issue needed to keep the business alive			0
@entity108 is keen to impress his stamp upon @entity4 as soon as possible @entity101 , who saw a £ 16m rescue package rejected earlier this year , remains keen to get involved			2
but reports emerging from @entity107 at the weekend suggest that his reported £ 44m settlement with the tax man could be open to review and dramatically increased			0
an investigation led by a @entity128 advocate has reportedly uncovered evidence that the @entity130 had illegally spied on taxpayers it was targeting — including some it subsequently struck deals with			0
the investigation into ‘ rogue behaviour ’ also calls into question the legality of deals done — with @entity101 named as one of the most high - profile individuals allowed to pay back just a fraction of the tax allegedly owed			0
@entity107 president @entity143 has been called upon to launch a full commission of inquiry			0
even the suggestion of a renewed investigation could tie up @entity101 ’s time and funds while the threat of a huge new bill may scupper any last chance he has of buying into the club			0
@entity154 despite the club 's financial implosion , @entity2 has had money to work with during his three - and - a - half year reign as boss			1
but the 52 - year - old repeatedly put his faith in players he knew with @entity164 experience who failed to recreate their former performance level			0
allies of the manager will point out that he did not have a scouting network to rely on , but moves for highly - paid figures like @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 simply did not work , while others signings such as @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 were outright failures			2
style of play the signs were good for @entity2 when he first took over and @entity4 managed to rack up a 15 - point lead over @entity185 in his first season			1
but as that lead was thrown away , a frailty in his management was brutally exposed			0
but worse was to come for the former @entity192 striker as despite the mammoth resources he could call upon as he faced up to part - time minnows following the club 's liquidation , his side often struggled			2
tactically naive , one - paced and lacking creativity , the club 's faithful soon grew tired as they toiled against sides they should have been ripping apart			2
contract rangers have staggered from one crisis to another - all the while wasting millions of pounds in the process			0
but @entity2 did himself no favours by accepting an £ 800,000 - a - year deal to manage the club while it was marooned at the depths of the @entity213 game			1
even when he volunteered to take a 50 per cent wage cut , many fans were disappointed that it took several weeks of negative headlines before it was finally agreed			0
@entity2 's salary then increased to £ 750,000 a year when he handed his notice in and as recently as friday the manager was adamant he would see out his notice period			1
youth development many @entity225 supporters thought that by going down to the @entity226 , @entity4 would be able to flood their team with young recruits while they stock - piled cash for their @entity164 return			1
but @entity2 was reluctant to put his faith in his @entity233 youngsters , claiming they were not good enough to see the club back through the divisions			2
the only youngster to have made any impact in recent years has been @entity238			0
the @entity192 under - 21 midfielder is undoubtedly a promising talent but one graduate from an entire youth system seems wasteful to many			0
@entity243 since replacing @entity244 in the summer of 2010 , @entity2 has failed to win a single cup competition in 11 attempts			2
rangers remain in this season 's two major domestic knockout tournaments but suffered fresh shame when they blew a two - goal lead against @entity252 as they crashed out of the @entity254 semis earlier this month			2
other humiliations include losing last year 's @entity257 final to @entity258 and being taken to a replay by @entity261 outfit @entity260 .			0

@entity2 had offered his resignation from the club last week
@entity2 remained in charge for nine days , but has now left the club
@entity4 beat @entity27 2 - 0 on saturday and are second in @entity29
club statement : ' it is now in the best interests of all parties to move on '
assistant @entity14 will take over as manager until end of season
@entity0 is favourite for the job , with @entity31 also in the running
