@entity2 , a single mother after banker @entity14 first denied paternity and then gave up custody rights , was attending a breakfast conference in @entity18 in the @entity4 when the planes hit and she tragically died after making a panicked call to her brother			1
immediately following her death , @entity2 's sister , @entity23 , who was three - months pregnant herself , uprooted her life as a travel agent in @entity26 and moved back to her native @entity27 to raise her two - year - old niece who had suddenly been left motherless			1
but in 2004 , soon after the young girl , who @entity30 is n't identifying , was awarded $ 2 million from the @entity31 , @entity14 reappeared in his daughter 's life , and has been fighting @entity2 for custody or at least access since , as she strives to adopt her niece			1
after a nine - year court battle , the fight will come to a head today with a hearing in @entity41 to determine what is in the best interest of the teenager , according to @entity45			1
@entity2 , 54 , claims @entity14 disappeared from his daughter 's life for four years and should have no say in the adoption he is attempting to scupper			1
but @entity14 , 50 , of @entity48 , claims @entity2 , who has allegedly blocked him from seeing the girl , should n't be allowed to adopt his daughter			1
' [ her ] best interests require regular visitation with me , her father , ' he says in court papers , according to @entity45			0
@entity2 , who was 41 when she died , was described in a @entity57 article in december 2002 as a witty and adventurous woman who would do anything for those she loved , especially her daughter			0
the successful marketing director fell pregnant after a short - lived fling with @entity14 , a @entity27 banker , and decided to go ahead with the pregnancy			0
fight : @entity23 , pictured , is fighting to adopt her niece whose mother died on 9/11 after her daughter was born in february 1999 , @entity14 denied he was her father though a court - ordered paternity test that september showed a strong probability that he was			1
court papers show that the following january , the former lovers came to an agreement whereby @entity14 withdrew any custody and visitation rights in exchange for @entity2 giving up on child support			1
it was four years before he saw or contacted his daughter , the documents state			0
when @entity2 died , she was living in @entity80 , close by her parents and within walking distance of her job at @entity84			0
and , from accounts , being a single mom suited her just fine			0
a woman who worked at her daughter 's nursery , where @entity2 was never late at pick up time , said she was known to everyone as ' @entity91 ' because every single morning she arrived armed with fresh bagels from the bakery			2
' @entity2 would come in the door and would enthusiastically proclaim " i am the bagel mom " and would pass out bagels with ( her daughter ) to all of the children in the classroom , ' the woman said			0
' she was very vivacious and had so much energy			0
@entity2 always addressed every child in the room by name before taking ( her daughter ) home			0
i did n't know @entity2 well , but i do know that she loved ( her daughter ) to pieces and that ( her daughter ) loved her			0
' but after her death , her sister was quick to assume the ' mommy ' role as best she could			0
tragedy : single mother , @entity2 , was at a breakfast meeting when a plane hit the twin towers using cash from the 9/11 compensation fund , @entity2 rented and later bought an @entity120 apartment for her niece , her biological daughter and herself to live in			1
around this time she was appointed the child 's legal guardian and the pair quickly formed a deep bond			0
according to a @entity129 article , the then three - year - old interchangeably called @entity130 ' and ' mommy			2
' in court papers , her lawyer said @entity2 gave the girl ' a safe , loving and caring home ' and paid for summer camp and a private school for both girls as well as taking them to museums			2
@entity14 reemerged in the family 's lives just two weeks after his daughter was rewarded the payout in 2004 , the same year he filed for bankruptcy			2
he called @entity2 to say he 'd read that @entity2 had been killed in the terrorist attack after searching her name online and weeks later , in february 2004 , sent his daughter a photo of himself , which is when @entity2 filed for adoption			2
@entity14 later claimed his absence in the child 's life was because he was waiting for his daughter to turn five before getting in touch			2
the messy court battle began in june that year , when @entity14 attempted to get custody of the girl and reverse @entity2 's guardianship			1
remembering : @entity2 's family erected a memorial bench , pictured , in their loved one 's honor after 9/11 in march 2012 , a state court of appeals upheld a decision made earlier by @entity166 that because @entity14 previously had no interest in his daughter his consent was n't required for the adoption to proceed			1
but a judge later took objection to @entity2 's denying @entity14 visitation rights and appointed a guardian who audited the aunt 's use of her niece 's compensation cash			1
@entity2 had transferred the money to her own bank account and purchased the $ 900,000 @entity120 apartment in both her and her niece 's names			2
this audit further delayed the adoption process and @entity14 took the time to petition the court for today 's best interest trial			1
@entity23 and her lawyer declined to comment to @entity45 on the story but in court papers the attorney said : ' at all times @entity130 has been ready , willing and able to adopt and has made every effort to move the adoption forward			0
' @entity14 and his lawyer also declined to comment to the news website .			0
