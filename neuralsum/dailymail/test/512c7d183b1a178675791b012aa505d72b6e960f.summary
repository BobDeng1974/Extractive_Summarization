@entity1 's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the @entity4 , when @entity5 cursed his @entity7 team			1
@entity8 , the world champion , was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but @entity5 , his team - mate , was grim - faced , demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team			1
@entity5 will start behind pole - sitter @entity8 with @entity14 third on the grid in @entity16 @entity5 cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to @entity8 by just 0.042secs @entity5 was only four - hundredths of a second behind the @entity22 and will start second on the grid			1
@entity14 of @entity24 is third , nearly a second adrift of @entity8			2
but @entity5 was visibly angry after the @entity7 pit - wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘ pressure ’			1
the @entity28 was the last driver out for his final flying lap , meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time			1
@entity5 , who is customarily gracious in defeat , fell slightly short of @entity8 ’s mark and was grumpy afterwards			1
he said : ‘ it was not ideal to put me under pressure like that			0
i do n’t think it cost me anything , but even the mind - set to know that i have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that			0
sparks fly off the back of @entity5 's @entity7 during qualifying for sunday 's race in @entity46 the @entity28 has now been out - qualified by @entity8 at each of the three races this season ‘ other than that the lap was good and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect , so four hundredths is always in it			1
@entity54 degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit			0
so there are many opportunities			0
’ poor old @entity5 was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season , but he seems terribly lacklustre since @entity8 won the title			1
even his @entity7 boss , @entity67 , said he should ‘ sort himself out ’ — a statement on @entity5 ’s psyche rather than his work ethic			1
whether he has the speed to match @entity8 may be at the centre of his anger			2
the @entity22 set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. it was enough			0
@entity5 , though , got closer to @entity77 than he has recently			2
@entity78 will again be towards the back of the grid with @entity81 17th and @entity82 18th			0
barely a hair ’s breadth separated the former champions			0
@entity81 said : ‘ i guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today			0
in practice , we ’d looked a bit more competitive , certainly			0
‘ we ’d found a reasonably good balance with the car , in fact , but the lap - time is n’t quite there yet			2
’ @entity8 will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in @entity16			0

@entity5 was the last driver out of the pit - lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out - lap than he would have liked *ahead* of his final shot at pole
the @entity28 *narrowly* lost out to his team - mate @entity8
@entity5 was just 0.042secs *slower* than his @entity7 rival
@entity5 also said : ' oh , come on , guys ' , over the team radio after he was *informed* he *'d* missed out on pole for sunday 's @entity4
