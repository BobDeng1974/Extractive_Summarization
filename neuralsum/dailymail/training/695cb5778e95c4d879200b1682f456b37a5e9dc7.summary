by @entity0 the location was unremarkable , a small theatre in @entity4 ’s headquarters in the @entity6 town of @entity7			2
and the ceremony was admirably understated , with dear old @entity9 indolently fishing plastic balls from a @entity12 bowl			2
yet the tension was undeniable , because they were making the draw for the quarter - finals of the @entity17			1
and the thrill felt strangely familiar			0
some of us recognised that feeling from a hundred similar ceremonies involving plastic balls and coded numbers			0
we remember those dry , bloodless tones , informing us that ‘ number 38 , @entity24 , will play @entity25 , @entity26			0
’ and we imagined the whoops and yells breaking out in the @entity24 dressing room			0
they were the days when the @entity31 occupied a central place in the @entity34 season , when footballers and fans alike would speak of @entity37 as if it were @entity38			1
with the world watching : @entity40 and @entity41 star @entity9 draws out @entity42 on friday jubilation : @entity45 's players ( including the late sir @entity46 , second left ) hear they have been drawn against @entity31 holders @entity48 back in 1963 centre stage : @entity51 fans listen to the @entity31 draw in 1964 a small experiment may demonstrate the current status of the competition			1
ask a selection of keen football followers to recite that @entity59 quarter - final draw			1
there will be some hesitation , the odd mistake , but such is the status of the clubs involved that most fans would readily supply chapter and verse			0
now ask those same fans to detail the draw for the semi-finals of the @entity31			1
i suggest that many would struggle to come up with @entity73 v @entity26 and @entity75 v @entity74			0
for it is now a contest of small consequence , an event which barely registers on the nation ’s radar			0
the @entity31 has become a competition which makes shifty evaders of upright managers : ‘ you want to know why we ’re putting out our third team ? well , our striker ’s hamstring has tweaked , our winger ’s grandmother has expired , and the work experience kid ’s in goal on account of the virus which wiped out all our other keepers			1
thankfully , they ’ll all be fit for next week , apart , of course , from the winger ’s grannie			0
’ adulation : @entity73 's matchwinner @entity102 lifts the @entity31 trophy at @entity37 last may it is what we have come to , yet it does not have to be like that			1
with a single , modest adjustment , the @entity31 could regain its central place on our sporting stage			1
quite simply , the winners of the @entity31 should automatically qualify for one of @entity34 ’s four places in the @entity17			1
the idea is not original but the alarming decline of the competition lends it a desperate urgency			2
at the moment , the @entity31 winners are rewarded with a place in the group stage of the @entity123 , which is rather like winning the @entity124 and sharing the prize with half a million other lucky punters			1
but a guaranteed place in the @entity17 , with all that entails in terms of finance and status , is a different matter			1
overnight , treatment tables would empty , excuses would evaporate and football managers would start to tell the truth			0
in short , the @entity31 would come roaring back to life			1
naturally , there is a snag , and that snag is called the @entity140			2
suggest to almost any of the club chairmen that they should voluntarily cede a @entity17 place and their indignation would be wondrous to behold			1
for @entity59 is the place where profits are measured in multiples of millions			1
the prospect of @entity59 , however remote for some , is the carrot which enticed them to join their 20 - club cabal in the first place			1
and yet , from time to time , this self - serving gang need reminding that the game is not merely a vehicle for their profits or their profile			2
the @entity31 existed and flourished long before they invested a single dollar , dinar or rouble , and if the task of restoring it to its proper place should cause them some slight financial inconvenience , then so be it			1
clearly , the people who ought to be fighting this cause are those entrusted with the welfare of the @entity31 competition			1
but the @entity31 ’s record of standing up to the @entity140 is not impressive			1
as the body responsible for the governance of @entity34 football , the @entity31 had the power to shape football ’s future when the @entity17 was formed in 1992			1
tragically , they lacked the vision to dictate intelligent terms			0
today , they appear to lack both the clout and courage to take on the men with the money			0
and yet , the stakes are genuinely important			0
in itself , the act of prising a @entity59 place from the hands of the @entity140 could be seen as little more than a political manoeuvre			1
but the practical effects would be enormous			0
@entity59 's elite ? @entity26 have not won a trophy since 2005 yet have qualified for the @entity17 every year over the past five seasons , the fourth - placed @entity140 team have finished 18 , 16 , 12 , 20 and 16 points — an average of 16.4 points — behind the winners			1
fourth place in the @entity205 , no matter how close to the winner you are , does not get you on the podium			2
fourth place in a parliamentary election usually means a lost deposit			2
and yet , in modern @entity34 football , such a trifling achievement offers an entry into the @entity59 elite			1
it is totally illogical and demonstrably unjust , and the @entity31 must find the nerve to say so			2
for 142 years , their trophy has found a fond place in the heart of our game			2
they have a duty to preserve its power and its glory			2
responsibility : @entity31 chairman @entity229 ( centre ) needs to fight for the @entity31 time to turn a deaf ear to @entity233 's big noises motor racing has been attempting to civilise the fuel - guzzling , air - polluting affront to the environment that is @entity233			1
engine manufacturers insisted that @entity233 ’s technology needs to be more relevant to their road car programmes			1
they , therefore , voted to switch from @entity243 engines to the quieter , greener @entity246 turbo			0
this , it appears , puts a far greater premium on driving skill and also allows the cheers of the crowd to be heard , something which was impossible with the ear - splitting @entity243			2
we imagined that this enlightened move would meet with universal approval			0
@entity257 , the famously feisty chief executive of @entity233 , declared himself ‘ horrified ’ by the change			1
not loud enough , apparently ; certainly not as loud as , say , the slipstream of a @entity260			0
as @entity257 put it : ‘ these cars do n’t sound like racing cars			2
’ so he wants to make them a great deal louder			0
bring the noise : @entity233 supremo @entity257 has criticised the new regulations on the sport but if this may be passed off as the harmless eccentricity of an 83 - year - old billionaire , then what to make of @entity273 , who enjoys the title of ‘ @entity276 grand prix corporation chief executive ’			1
he believed that the new rules detract from the ‘ sexiness ’ of the event			0
he complained that he did not need earplugs			0
finally , he described the noise in the pit lane as being like ‘ harpsichords in a chamber orchestra ’			2
i note that the @entity286 are performing @entity288 ’s @entity287 on wednesday evening			0
if our @entity273 is correct , it may be well worth a visit			0
but we should not take him seriously , any more than we should indulge @entity257 ’s yearning for deafening decibels			2
instead , we should hope that the reformers stick to their guns			0
and that all the absurd objections are drowned in the roar of the crowd			1
winner : @entity300 driver @entity299 celebrates his triumph in @entity302 last weekend some of the best lines in sport were uttered by boxers before a fight			0
from the dazzling soliloquies of @entity308 , to the first man who ever said ‘ the bigger they are , the harder they fall ’ , to that marvellously wry remark of @entity313 : ‘ he can run but he ca n’t hide			0
’ @entity315 has a mundane scuffle coming up , against somebody whose name escapes me			0
sadly , droll witticisms are not mr @entity315 ’s style			0
so he made his point by standing up , turning over a table , and stomping out			0
clearly , we are in for a feast of @entity327 wit before the first blows are struck			0
turning the tables : @entity330 heavyweight boxer @entity315 was lost for words last week @entity332 since we are not slow to criticise our football authorities , we must offer praise where it ’s due			0
the @entity31 have decided to mark the 25th anniversary of the @entity340 disaster by delaying the kick - offs of all @entity140 , @entity336 and @entity337 matches by seven minutes			1
the same delay will apply to both @entity31 semi-finals , reminding us that the @entity346 - @entity345 semi-final of 1989 was ended six minutes after kick - off as the extent of the crowd tragedy became apparent			1
the gesture is poignant , sensitive and admirably inspired .			0

@entity31 draws used to be as thrilling as @entity17 ones are now
competition is belittled by fourth - placed @entity140 club earning place among @entity59 's elite instead of @entity31 winners
this simple change would return @entity31 to its former glory
@entity257 absurd to *favour* @entity233 engine noise of crowd roar
moving *tribute* by @entity31 to delay kick - offs for @entity340 25th anniversary
