by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 signed off from pre-season with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity5 on sunday			1
they face @entity7 in their @entity9 opener next weekend			2
but what did their win over the @entity13 outfit tell us ahead of the new season ? click here for the full match report from @entity2 1 - 0 @entity5 @entity19 is a player at £ 12million , he is the costliest of the summer signings but it looks a shrewd investment			1
he is tricky but tireless with it and was the one player who brightened an otherwise dull contest			0
he populates those pockets around a lone frontman – in this case @entity30 – and is fearless in possession , constantly showing for the ball and picking probing passes			0
click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there 's £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week ... fearless : @entity41 was the costliest of the summer signings at £ 12million but looks a shrewd investment the @entity2 are going to love @entity45 the 18 - year - old was introduced at half - time in a bid to inject some spark and that he did			1
the left - winger is a box of tricks with a blistering turn of foot and his willingness to run at opponents is a quality sadly lacking in the modern game			2
like @entity19 he plays without fear and that raw enthusiasm will endear him to supporters			0
bright spark : @entity45 is a box of tricks and has a blistering turn of foot to twist his opponents @entity68 should have no problems winning over @entity2 the former @entity71 midfielder swapped the @entity72 for the @entity73 this summer in a controversial move			1
no player has enjoyed more pre-season minutes and he is sure to start against @entity7 next sunday			2
interestingly , @entity77 used him in an advanced midfield role against @entity5 but again he caught the eye with his refusal to surrender possession and put a shift in for his side			2
no problems : former @entity71 player @entity68 swapped the wear for the @entity73 in a controversial move in the action : @entity68 makes a tackle during the pre-season friendly and has been repeatedly picked to play @entity90 needs games before he 'll be back to his best the official records will mark him as the match - winner but the @entity95 international had been awful throughout			1
he was afforded an extended holiday following his involvement at the @entity99 but he might as well have still been on the beach until his 88th - minute strike			0
he was sloppy in possession and lethargic in his motion – a big improvement is needed			0
more time needed : @entity90 won the match with his goal but played awful throughout at @entity108 do n't celebrate just yet , @entity90 : @entity90 looked sloppy in possession and was disappointing overall pre-season has run its course ! yes , this dire affair thankfully signalled the end of the summer warm - up matches			1
given its proximity to the new season perhaps those on display were holding something back or even feared suffering injury			0
either way , as a spectacle it offered little and left everyone craving competitive football .			0

@entity2 beat @entity5 1 - 0 in last pre-season game of the summer
@entity2 make @entity9 start against champions @entity7
@entity45 looks *exciting* , @entity68 should have no problems at @entity108 , but what else did @entity132 learn from the final friendly ?
