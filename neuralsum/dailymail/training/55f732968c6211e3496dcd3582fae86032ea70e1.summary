by @entity0 a solicitor from @entity2 who was n't content on just having a successful 9 to 5 career has certainly become high flying in her spare time too , as a champion cheer leader			2
@entity7 's top job sees her battling for clients in court and working long hours for a medical negligence firm			1
but she 's just as skilled at winning cases as she is at winning cheerleading trophies and has just returned from competing at the @entity13 in @entity14			1
as well as being a lawyer @entity7 dedicates her spare time to her cheerleading @entity7 ( right ) has just returned from competing at the @entity13 in @entity14 @entity7 , 27 , took up cheerleading aged 16 after years of gymnastics and cheered her way through her degree at the @entity21			1
she even set up her own squad the @entity22 and her current team the @entity24 were crowned national champions in 2013			2
last year she finally achieved her dream of attending the @entity13 where her team placed 5th and they were back again for a second time this april			1
but all the while , @entity7 was living a parallel life as an ambitious young lawyer			2
@entity7 took up cheerleading aged 16 after years of gymnastics and cheered her way through her degree at the @entity21 her dream of working in court as a top level solicitor has finally come true and she now battles to get compensation for people who have suffered from medical negligence			1
despite her double life she was anxious about telling some colleagues about her hobby in case they looked down on her unusual extra-curricular activity			0
thankfully , most of her workmates could n't be more understanding , even if they are a bit surprised when she pulls her uniform out of her bag among piles of legal papers and law books			2
@entity7 , pictured third right with the @entity24 , is rarely without her laptop and phone at practices and competitions @entity22 , the team , which @entity7 set up in @entity59 her busy life means @entity7 regularly dashes from court with her trainers under her arm and her backpack over her shoulders on the way to training up to five times a week			1
likewise , when at competitions she 's rarely without her laptop and phone as she never lets either of her passions take a back seat			0
@entity7 said : ' it is hard to juggle both sometimes but i could n't give up either - i love law and cheerleading too much - it 's both my dreams come true at once			1
@entity7 often has to switch quickly between cheerleading and her job as a lawyer ' if i 'm court the next day i often come back from training and then end up working in the breaks or late at night when i get in but it 's worth it			1
' i often have to switch quickly between the two			0
' sometimes it will be as quick a transformation as taking a witness statement or leaning over to counsel to give instructions one minute , and changing into my trainers the next			0
' most people at work know about my secret hobby but people were very sceptical at the beginning			0
' i did n't tell some of the partners because i did n't want to be put in the bimbo box , but i 'm proud to be showing that cheerleaders care more about the skimpy outfits and the fake tan			0
' it 's very athletic and i 've had everything from broken fingers to bruised cheeks doing the lifts and tumbles that make up our routines			0
' although if i could run around in trainers all day that would be great but instead it 's heels and a black suit for my 9 - to - 5 and then my purple sparkly cheer uniform			0
