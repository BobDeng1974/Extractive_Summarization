by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 09:53 est , 24 june 2013 a father - of - one was forced to @entity3 his symptoms after 150 visits to doctors failed to provide him with a diagnosis			1
@entity8 , 34 , was subjected to two years of @entity9 and hospital appointments after developing constant throat pain following a family holiday in july 2010			1
the sales manager lost four - and - a - half stone and went from playing football twice a week to being tired all of the time			2
@entity8 , 34 , developed a constant sore throat after returning from holiday in july 2010			1
he attended 150 gp and hospital appointments but none provided a diagnosis despite hospital appointments and visits to his doctor up to six times a month , medics could not work out what was wrong with him			1
mr @entity8 feared he had cancer but after researching his symptoms on the internet and watching videos on @entity34 , he found out about a rare condition called @entity37 syndrome			1
eagle syndrome occurs when a ligament at the back of the throat become calcified or hardened , or when a bone at the base of the skull becomes elongated			1
symptoms include throat and ear pain			2
sufferers often have the feeling something is stuck in their throat and have difficulty swallowing			0
remarkably , despite telling doctors about the disease , mr @entity8 was not tested for it at three separate gp practices or at the @entity56			1
mr @entity8 eventually googled his symptoms and found out about eagle syndrome - stiffening of a ligament at the back of the throat therefore , mr @entity8 decided to pay for private care at @entity61 in @entity62 in october last year and was finally diagnosed with the rare medical condition			1
he has now criticised the @entity64 for failing to spot the condition despite the staggering number of @entity9 and hospital appointments			1
mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity68 , said : ‘ people started questioning my mental health because i was always at the doctors , yet they could never find out what was wrong with me			1
‘ through research , i found out about a condition called @entity37 syndrome , which seemed to tick all the symptoms i was suffering			1
‘ i saw videos about it on @entity34 and googled it but even though i told my doctors about it , no - one would believe me or test me for it			2
‘ it was so frustrating			0
the pain and the symptoms would n’t go away but doctors just were n’t interested and would just tell me to take painkillers			2
‘ i even paid to go and get second opinions privately but every time i did it was the same doctors i had seen on the @entity64			2
‘ because i had a sore throat for so long i thought i had throat cancer			2
‘ at the time i was on the cusp of becoming a father and i worried i would never get to see my daughter			0
‘ i felt anxious and depressed and contemplated suicide			0
when i finally got the diagnosis , i felt a lot of relief			0
’ he added : ‘ i saw a consultant in @entity62 and within minutes of looking at my ct scan he confirmed it was @entity37 syndrome			1
‘ i was appalled - it just shows that if all the other doctors listened to me instead of fobbing me off then i would have been diagnosed two years earlier			2
’ mr @entity8 , who spent £ 10,000 trying to get a diagnosis , is now being treated as an @entity64 patient at @entity108			1
before paying for private treatment , mr @entity8 told doctors at his @entity9 surgery and at @entity56 ( pictured ) that he thought he had @entity37 syndrome but he was not tested for it he had anti-inflammatory injections in march this year and has a follow up appointment later this year to see if he needs surgery			1
mr @entity8 , who lives with his wife @entity116 , 30 , and daughter @entity116 , two , said : ‘ it was some sort of virus that set it all off			1
i felt tired all the time			0
i lost four - and - a - half stone in weight			2
eagle syndrome is a collection of symptoms that include recurrent throat and ear pain , the feeling that there is something stuck at the back of the throat , difficulty swallowing and facial pain			2
the symptoms are caused by the elongation of the temporal bone , at the base of the skull , or by the calcification of the stylohyoid ligament at the back of the throat			1
the cause of the condition is poorly understood			0
it is diagnosed using x-rays or scans and treatments can include injections and surgery			0
‘ i went from 18 - stone , physically fit , playing football twice a week and leading a very active life , to simply going to work , then coming home and going to sleep			0
‘ i had injections that went straight into the styroid ligaments			0
it was the first time in over two years that i did n’t have a pain in my throat			0
‘ i still do n’t feel 100 per cent , i would say i ’m at 80 per cent now			0
‘ i ’ve spent £ 10,000 over the two and a half years but at least i have answers now			0
’ his wife added : ‘ i feel a bit guilty because i was one of the people thinking there was nothing wrong with him			0
‘ but @entity8 was right all along			0
‘ he went from being the life and soul of the party to a shadow of himself			0
’ a spokesman for @entity56 said : ‘ we can not comment on individual patient cases as the trust is bound by rules of patient confidentiality			0

over a period of two years he attended 150 gp and hospital appointments
none of the doctors was able to provide a clear diagnosis
googled his symptoms and discovered condition called @entity37 syndrome
it is *characterised* by hardening of a ligament at the back of the throat or by elongation of a bone at the base of the skull which causes *discomfort*
mr @entity8 paid for private tests which showed he had the syndrome
