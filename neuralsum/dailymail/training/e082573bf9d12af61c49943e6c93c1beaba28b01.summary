by @entity0 people whose blood sugar is on the high end of ' the normal range ' may be at greater risk of brain shrinkage , according to new research			1
the @entity9 - based research suggests a higher blood sugar level could lead to the kind of mental health issues that occur with aging and diseases such as dementia			2
researchers at the @entity17 in @entity18 say this could lead to a revolution in the understanding of how blood sugar levels affect the brain , and how diabetes is defined			2
a woman tests her blood sugar : latest research at the @entity17 suggests too high a level could lead to brain shrinkage the new research , published today in the medical journal @entity32 , involved 249 people age 60 to 64 , who had blood sugar in the normal range as defined by the @entity37			1
the participants had brain scans at the start of the study and again an average of four years later			0
those with higher fasting blood sugar levels within the normal range - below 6.1 mmol / l - were more likely to have a loss of brain volume in the areas of the hippocampus and the amygdala , areas that are involved in memory and cognitive skills , than those with lower blood sugar levels			0
overload : the study suggests , particularly for older people , that blood sugar levels should be reduced if reaching the high end of the scale after controlling for age , high blood pressure , smoking , alcohol use and other factors , the researchers found that blood sugar on the high end of normal accounted for six to 10 percent of the brain shrinkage			1
study author @entity69 said : ' numerous studies have shown a link between type 2 diabetes and brain shrinkage and dementia , but we have n't known much about whether people with blood sugar on the high end of normal experience these same effects			1
' a fasting blood sugar level of 10.0 mmol / l ( 180 mg / @entity82 ) or higher is defined as diabetes and a level of 6.1 mmol / l ( 110 mg / @entity82 ) is considered impaired , or prediabetes			0
' these findings suggest that even for people who do not have diabetes , blood sugar levels could have an impact on brain health , ' @entity69 said			0
' more research is needed , but these findings may lead us to re-evaluate the concept of normal blood sugar levels and the definition of diabetes			0

high but ' safe ' blood levels accounted for up to ten per cent of brain shrinkage in test group of *250* @entity9
