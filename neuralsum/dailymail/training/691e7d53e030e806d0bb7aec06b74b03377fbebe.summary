@entity0 met @entity9 , 20 years her junior , on a social networking website			1
over the next four years the 48 - year - old lavished the 28 - year - old with gifts and cash			1
however , @entity0 was left heartbroken when she discovered that he chose to repay her by marrying another woman – and not telling her			1
@entity0 from @entity17 , @entity18 , believes he must have used some of her money to fund the secret nuptials with his new wife , although he denies this claim			1
she says that funding his lifestyle has left her struggling to manage financially			2
' i 'm convinced he must have spent at least some of my money marrying the other woman			2
he broke my heart and my bank balance			2
i 'm left in crippling debt from loans			2
' @entity0 first met @entity9 after messaging him on the dating website , @entity38 , in 2009			1
the couple then began speaking on @entity40 every night			2
' he begged me to go out and see him , ' @entity0 said			1
' but because of a hernia in my bowel , i ca n't work and receive disability allowance			2
' i told him it would take a while for me to save and started putting away £ 70 from each cheque			2
@entity0 says she had her doubts behind @entity9 's motives for speaking to her but he was so charming she was easily won round			1
' at first part of me did wonder why a young guy like him was interested in me			2
he just said you ca n't choose who you fall in love with			2
' despite his romantic declarations , @entity0 said she was terrified of meeting him in person			1
' i 've had a colostomy bag since i was 19 and was worried he 'd see me as some old biddy , ' she explained			2
during the four years that they were together @entity0 gave @entity9 £ 7000			1

the first time i went out there he treated me like a princess			2
he was so tanned and muscular			2
i knew i 'd fallen for him			0
i told him i could n't give him children and that he should find a girl his own age but he told me not to talk like that			0
' over the next week , we barely left the bedroom			0
i really thought i 'd hit the jackpot			0
' after returning to @entity0 says she missed him so much she took out a £ 400 high interest loan so she could fly out again two months later			1
by doing so it meant that @entity0 could not afford @entity90 presents for friends and family and had to buy gifts from discount stores for her daughters , @entity96 , 26 , and @entity97 , 24			1
despite having to make huge sacrifices once @entity0 arrived in @entity2 she said it appeared that the effort had been worth it when she was met with a big surprise			1
@entity0 says that at the beginning of their relationship they hardly left the bedroom but she soon noticed that her partner was reluctant to have sex with her on her second visit to @entity2 , @entity9 surprised @entity0 by proposing to her at his home at a party ' on my second day out there he arranged a huge surprise party where he proposed			1
i thought it was soon , but i was swept up in the moment			0
' ' i did have doubts when i saw @entity9 slow - dancing with another woman , but he assured me she was just a friend			1
' just before leaving her fiancé @entity0 was met with more monetary demands that she felt she could n't refuse			1
' then the day before i left , he told me he had to pay a £ 300 fine or he would be enrolled in the army			0
' he said it would mean we could n't speak or see each other any more			0
i was devastated and agreed to split the amount with his parents			0
' after that , the mother - of - two said her toyboy needed to pay an extra £ 25 a week to stop him being forced into the military			2
at the proposal party @entity0 says that she noticed @entity9 slow dancing with another woman but in her state of happiness chose to ignore it @entity0 adapted to @entity9 's culture whole heartedly , devoting her life to her husband - to - be @entity0 would go without food in order to afford her tickets to @entity2 and soon enough @entity9 got wind of her devotion to him and began to ask @entity0 for money ' i could n't stand the thought of not speaking to him , so pretty soon i was giving him £ 70 a fortnight out of my benefits , ' she explained			1
' he thought i was rich , but i kept telling him it meant i had to go without			0
i had to bulk buy discount food and often skip meals			0
but at the end of the day he was going to be my husband , so what was mine was his			0
' i 'd send him out gifts too			0
i bought him trainers , countless mobile phones and aftershave			0
' it was during a visit to @entity2 in october 2013 , after dating for almost four years , that @entity0 started to get suspicious			1
they always stayed at the family home , but this time @entity9 said they needed to stay in an apartment to give his parents a break			1
after paying £ 600 for the week , @entity0 said she barely saw her fiancé			1
' he stopped wanting to have sex with me and he 'd leave me in the flat while he went out			0
' it was like he did n't want to be near me , always snapping and being cruel			0
he 'd tell me he had to run errands , then not return for hours			0
i did n't know the language so i was left stranded indoors			0
' despite the warning signs @entity0 says she refused to believe that there was anything wrong and continued to pursue the relationship			1
@entity9 told @entity0 he had to pay a £ 300 fine to prevent him being enrolled in the army she agreed to split the bill with his parents and continued to fund him while she was back in @entity18 @entity0 began to notice @entity9 's behaviour change towards her and soon after received a message from the woman he had danced with at the engagement party claiming she was with @entity9 ' i told myself we were going through a rough patch			1
when the holiday was over and i was back home we still chatted every day			0
we spoke about our future , our wedding , everything felt back on track			0
' but just a few weeks later her world came crumbling down when she received a message from a woman on @entity8			0
' i logged on and saw that i 'd received a private message from a woman called @entity202			0
' it said she was with @entity9 and that he 'd been using me for money			1
clicking on her profile picture , i felt sick to my stomach			0
@entity209 was the woman who had been slow - dancing with @entity9 at my engagement party			1
' i felt like i was trapped in a nightmare			0
when i confronted him he sounded so calm and assured me that @entity209 was just a silly girl with a crush			0
' worse betrayal was yet to come though when @entity0 logged on to @entity8 a month later , on 14 january this year			1
' i had n't heard from @entity9 in a while so went on his profile and my jaw dropped in horror			1
he 'd uploaded a new picture - his marriage certificate to @entity209			2
' i felt like i 'd been thwacked with a baseball bat			0
my fiancé had married another woman and i 'd been utterly clueless			0
@entity0 was horrified to discover that @entity9 had wed the woman in question after he uploaded an image of their marriage certificate ( pictured right ) to @entity8 ' i called @entity9 and asked how he could do this to me and whether he 'd used my money to afford his big day			1
all he did was laugh			0
it was heartbreaking and humiliating			0
he never apologised , never gave me any explanation			0
' @entity0 says that she now sees how she was used by her toyboy but has not let it deter her from finding love elsewhere			1
' i ca n't believe i wasted four years of my life with that rat			0
sometimes i doubt whether he ever really loved me			0
maybe all he ever saw me as was a walking , human cash machine			0
' i 've added it up and i gave @entity9 more than £ 7,000			1
but i 'm determined not to mope			0
i 've met a new @entity2 man who treats me like royalty and never asks for money			1
' the complete opposite of @entity246			0
i want to name and shame him , and let the women of the @entity249 know what he 's capable of			2
' when approached by the media , @entity9 claims that he funded his wedding himself and that he does not wish to hear from his former fiancée			1
' please tell @entity0 to forget me			1
i am married now with my love			0
