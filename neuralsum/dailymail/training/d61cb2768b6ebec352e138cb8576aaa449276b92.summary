it was once a distant dream found only in sci - fi books			0
but 50 years on , satellite television pictures are now beamed into millions of homes around the world			2
today marks the half - century anniversary of the first public satellite television broadcast across the @entity7 from the @entity8 to @entity9 and mainland @entity10			2
the transmissions using a space satellite launched into orbit revolutionised popular entertainment and sparked an explosion in technological development			1
historic : television monitors in @entity19 on july 12 1962 show the first images broadcast by satellite from the @entity9 to to the @entity8 ' it was n't actually the first satellite broadcast but because it was seen by so many people when it was on , it had a tremendous impact on people 's perception of distance and extension of their consciousness , ' said @entity31 , grandson of television pioneer @entity32 and curator of broadcast culture at the @entity36 in @entity37			1
' their perception of the world had changed			0
suddenly you could see across the ocean as easily as you could make a phone call			0
' three years after the first satellite broadcast , a child watched the first televised pictures of the moon in 1965 thanks to the technology introduced a few years earlier the first transatlantic face - to - face television broadcast from @entity10 to the @entity8 takes place on october 15 , 1963			1
they are discussing ' @entity51 ' the first ever satellite broadcast came against the backdrop of the @entity54 , a year after @entity56 cosmonaut @entity55 had become the first man in space			1
in the same year , @entity59 released their first hit single , @entity60 was beginning on @entity61 , and @entity9 's first legal casino had opened in @entity63			1
domestic television - broadcasts on electromechanical signals - had been airing since 1920s and tens of thousands of families had tv sets			0
the signals were sent by ground broadcasts from tv towers but satellite was delivered from space			1

before satellite , tv stations had to post recorded footage around the world tunes : one of the most iconic satellite tv channels of the 90s , @entity94 , broadcast to a string of countries across the globe using signals from orbit first pioneered in the 60s a @entity102 man proudly displays the satellite tv pictures he 's receiving from a dish pitched outside his remote tent in @entity106 , @entity107 , in 2006 dozens of colorful satellite dishes decorate the sides of council flats in @entity112 , @entity113 , in 2012 as they pick up signals from across the globe footballers in @entity116 watch this year 's @entity118 football tournament on a tv set receiving the same footage beamed around the world but the satellite images were a changing point for @entity9 culture , according to mr @entity32			1
a @entity126 staellite was launched by @entity127 into space from @entity129 in @entity19 and a @entity9 receiver was built on @entity131 in @entity132			1
mr @entity32 said that before @entity126 , tv stations had to record on to tapes , which would then be flown to the destination country , meaning there could be a delay of hours if not days before they were broadcast			2
with live footage beamed from all corners of the globe today , it is hard to grasp how much faster satellite transmissions made delivering news and other images , he added			2
the @entity126 satellite , which belonged to telecommunications giant @entity147 , was launched by @entity127 at 4.35am on july 10 1962 , and the first television picture relayed from earth to space and back occurred later the same day , with a transmission of the @entity8 flag waving in front of the @entity154 in @entity155 , @entity129			1
technology breakthrough : engineers work on the @entity126 satellite , which @entity127 launched into @entity158 in 1962 in order to make the first ever satellite tv broadcast control staff at @entity162 in @entity132 , which used @entity163 , right , to receive the first live television signals from the @entity8 through the @entity126 satellite advance : the completed @entity166 at @entity162			1
it is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first satellite tv broadcast the first public images beamed from @entity19 to the @entity162 in @entity132 on july 23 should have been of president @entity171 , but because of a delay in the @entity8 viewers were first treated to footage of a baseball game which was being shown on @entity8 television			1
despite the seeming simplicity of what could be seen , the broadcast was the largest outside broadcast ever surpassing the @entity61 operation covering the coronation of the @entity75 in 1953 , mr @entity32 said			2
a television set from the 1940s that would have been able to pick up the first satellite broadcast an @entity147 spokesman said the idea of an active satellite , which does not simply reflect signals but amplifies and retransmits them , was conceived by science fiction writer @entity192 in 1945			1
ten years later @entity193 , of @entity194 , published a scientific paper outlining the possibilities for satellite communications			0
but it was the @entity56 launch of the @entity200 satellite in 1957 that really lit a fire under the plans			0
in january 1960 , @entity147 and @entity127 agreed to a joint project			0
@entity147 would design and construct an experimental satellite and pay @entity127 to launch it in what would be the first privately sponsored space launch			0
' the 34.5in ( 1.1m ) , 170lb ( 77kg ) satellite fit @entity127 's @entity212 rocket and once in orbit would receive microwave signals from a ground station , amplify them and rebroadcast them , " the spokesman said			2
' the team calculated an orbital path the rocket could reach , and located an ideal site for the @entity8 ground station near @entity155			0
' here they built a massive 160 - foot - diameter horn antenna , protected from the elements by the largest air - supported structure ever built			0
' on that morning in july 1962 , the team held its collective breath as countdown led to a perfect blast - off			0
' that evening vice president @entity229 , later president of the @entity8 , received the first satellite telephone call and within 30 minutes , @entity126 produced several other firsts : successfully transmitting faxes , high - speed data and both live and taped television			0
the satellite was used for several television demonstrations before going out of service on february 21 the following year .			0

signals were broadcast from space instead of @entity61 's existing ground transmissions
satellite broadcast revolutionised popular entertainment and changed @entity9 culture , says tv *inventor* 's grandson
