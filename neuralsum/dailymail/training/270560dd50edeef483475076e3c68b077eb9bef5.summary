from incredible devices designed to make humans stronger to clever gadgets that can cut noise pollution and waste from manufacturing processes , engineers have created amazing products designed to make our lives easier			1
they are fighting it out to win the @entity11 , which recognises ideas large and small that have the potential to solve significant problems			1
a total of 20 ideas have been shortlisted and they range from tackling large problems like renewable energy by generating power from waves , to ripening fruit and vegetables at the best time			1
a group of @entity26 engineers have invented the ' @entity27 ' to protect warehouse workers who frequenly lift heavy loads from the risk of arm and back injuries			1
their robitic arm is an upper - body exoskeleton that augments human strength and braces the back to prevent poor lifting technique @entity38 is an affordable prosthetic hand with inbuilt sensors that can read brain signals			2
all its parts are easily modified and made using a 3d printer the winner will be announced on november 7 and will win £ 30,000			1
the engineer will follow in the footsteps of @entity48 , who won the award last year for his safetynet device , which encourages sustainable fishing			0
a total of 650 projects were entered by creative scientists from 18 countries			1
' bold ideas big and small can solve significant problems			1
the entries into this year 's award , from young engineers and scientists around the world all show promise , but are only at the start of the long process towards commercialisation , ' sir @entity58 said			1
a handful of the engineers set out to solve health - related problems			1
@entity71 and his team from the @entity73 , @entity74 , have invented a robotic surgery tool to replace manual suturing , saving valuable time in the operating room			0
@entity79 is a device that indicates a speaker 's location using a light and volume			0
it could help people with hearing impairments who find it difficult to lip read and follow conversation in group situations @entity91 is a device that can be fitted onto a window to eliminate and cancel sound coming from outside a group of @entity26 engineers have invented the ' titan arm ' to protect warehouse workers who frequently lift heavy loads from the risk of arm and back injuries			2
their robotic arm is an upper - body exoskeleton that augments human strength and braces the back to prevent poor lifting technique			0
the team said the arm could also be used to help stroke and injury victims rebuild muscle and re-learn fine motor control			0
@entity115 designed a device called renewable wave power ( pictured ) that absorbs forces from the troughs and peaks of waves from any direction in a bid to make cleaner energy a suitcase made from @entity126 is pictured			1
it is made from waste material from the coarse wool industry @entity130 innovated @entity131 - an affordable dexterous prosthetic hand with inbuilt sensors that can read brain signals , while another @entity136 designer has created @entity79 - a device that indicates a speaker 's location to help those with hearing impairments lip read in a large group situation , where they can easily get left behind			2
@entity145 's distinctive looking 3d - printed @entity144 could keep arms rigid to help them heal after a fracture and is created from waste plastic			2
other designers also focused on the challenge of reducing wastage and recycling materials			2
@entity154 engineer @entity153 observed that the coarse wool industry creates a lot of waste product that goes to landfill and found that he could use this material to make a biodegradeable , flame resistant plastic , which he called @entity126			2
the material is made by carding the wool and then uses needles to shred and pull the fibres together to produce a material similar in feel to plastic or softer like a felt			0
@entity167 is a portable energy generator that allows the charging of electrical appliances using wind power - making it suitable to charge a phone in areas with limited access to mains electricity fruit and veg is best stored and ripened in specific conditions so @entity180 uses excess heat produced behind the fridge to power a separate unit that has sections designed to keep different fruit in different conditions to it ripens properly minimally invasive surgery leads to small incisions that can be difficult to suture - or seal			2
the @entity191 could eliminate the need for manual suturnig to save time in the operating room another @entity154 engineer , @entity115 , designed a device called renewable wave power that absorbs forces from the troughs and peaks of waves from any direction in a bid to make cleaner energy			1
while @entity154 has 11,073km of coastline and the potential to produce 40 - @entity209 per metre , the country currently harnesses just 1 per cent of the free resource			0
but mr @entity115 hopes his invention could change that			0
other scientists came up with innovative gadgets to transform everyday tasks			1
diabetics use a device that breaks the skin to measure their blood sugar levels but @entity220 could change that			0
it uses a person 's smartphone linked to a watch to measure the levels , eliminating the need to break the skin			0
an insulin pen takes the results from the watch and prepares the appropriate dosage cortex is a @entity235 printed system for fracture support that is lightweight , waterproof and ventilated			0
it could make itchy , cumbersome plaster casts a thing of the past @entity241 created @entity242 - a compact inkjet printer that can be place on top of a pile of paper that moves downwards to swallow the paper until none is left , creating in turn , another stack of finished papers			1
@entity250 came up with @entity251 , which are a series of led rings that are clipped onto a bike 's existing rims , powered by battery packs , while a fork - mounted magnet works with an integrated accelerometer to work out when the lights should be lit. the front half of the front rim shines bright white , while the back half of the rear rim glows red , much like car lights , to help cyclists be more easily seen by drivers on the road			0
revolights use are a series of led rings that are clipped onto a bike 's existing rims , powered by battery packs , while a fork - mounted magnet works with an integrated accelerometer to work out when the lights should be lit. they could make cyclists more visible on roads , preventing accidents @entity242 is a compact inkjet printer that is placed on top of a paper pile			2
when printing , it slowly moves downwards and swallows the pile until no paper is left , creating a new pile of printed papers with an ever increasing population , living spaces are becoming smaller and noisier as sounds from the street encroach on everyday life			1
this problem inspired @entity296 to create @entity297 - a device that can be fitted to a window that stops certain annoying noises from passing through the glass into a home			0
it might look like the @entity304 but comb is an autonomous dumper truck that uses @entity307 to perform tasks remotely in high contact sport concussion is common but it is often hard to know if a person needs medical attention			0
the @entity314 gum shield has sensors to measure any impact on a sportsman and transmits the data to medical staff at the side of a pitch			0
