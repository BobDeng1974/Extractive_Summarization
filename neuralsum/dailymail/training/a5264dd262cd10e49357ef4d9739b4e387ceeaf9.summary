by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:30 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:16 est , 20 december 2013 a small cube that can balance on its edges and rotate on its corners , as well as walk along , has been created by @entity7 engineers			1
@entity9 measures just 15cm in height and uses reaction wheels that rotate at high angular velocities to enable it to jump up and travel in a given direction			1
while the clever cube is currently a prototype , some researchers hope to use its method of moving along for planetary exploration vehicles and even self - assembling robots			1
the sensors are used to estimate the tilt of the cube and provide the angular velocity - the angular speed at which an object is rotating along with the direction in which it is rotating - of the reaction wheels , which are mounted on three faces of the cube			1
the reaction wheels can brake suddenly to cause the @entity9 to jump up from its ‘ resting position ’ onto one of its edges without external support , as it transfers momentum from the wheel ’s to the cube ’s body			1

balancing on its corner is achieved by two ‘ jump up ’ manoeuvres			0
the first one raises the @entity9 from one of its faces so that it can balance on its edge , while the second one raises it from the edge to one of its corners			1
@entity9 can detect disturbances to adjust its position while balancing on its corner , and also rotate on the spot			2
the miniature mechanical device is able to use a ‘ controlled fall ’ to travel in a certain direction and when it combines its jumping , balancing and falling moves , it can ‘ walk ’ across a surface , the scientists said			1
while the technology could be used in future space explorer vehicles and self - assembling robots , the ‘ cool little cube ’ was simply designed to ‘ jump up , balance and walk , ’ its creators said			1
@entity9 uses two manoeuvres to jump from its resting position to one of its edges and then balance on one of its corners			2
the mechanical device can detect disturbances to adjust its position while balancing on its corner ( illustrated ) and also rotate as impressive as the @entity148 ’s findings have been , the rover just does n’t have the brains to cut it further out in the solar system			2
this is because , at the start of each martian day , @entity152 has to deal with a significant communication delay when it sends its agenda to the @entity158 rover			0
even moving at light speed , instructions from @entity160 take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of @entity158			2
this 40 - minute roundtrip makes real - time control of the rover impossible on @entity167 's @entity166 , where astrobiologists suspect extraterrestrial life could exist , the delay balloons to over 90 minutes			2
but an ‘ intelligent ’ camera that can not only take pictures of alien rock , but also analyse them and draw intelligent conclusions about what to do next is hoping to change all that			0
named ‘ @entity178 ’ , the two - lens device snaps 3d images and a special processor , separate from the rover 's main computer , analyses the pictures			0
by recognising textures in the photos , the processor distinguishes between sand , rocks and sky			0
the processor then uses the size and distance to rocks in the picture to determine if any are scientifically important layered rocks			0
when @entity178 spots an interesting rock , it can either upload a high - resolution image back to @entity160 or send a message to the main processor to move toward the rock and take a sample			0
it works similarly to the facial unlock feature available on smartphones and computers			0
the more examples of interesting rocks it was shown , the better it becomes at identifying the common features that make rocks scientifically important			0
recently @entity178 was successfully run through its paces in the rocky landscape of the @entity215 in @entity216 — a useful test environment for the @entity158 surface .			0

engineers at the @entity31 , @entity32 , *developed* the 15cm mechanical cube that combines three moves to walk along
@entity9 is a prototype , but some researchers hope to use its method of moving along for space exploration vehicles and self - assembling robots
