@entity0 is one step closer to launching the spacecraft which could one day take humans to @entity4			2
workers at @entity6 gathered to watch as the @entity8 capsule emerged from its assembly hangar , less than three months from its first test flight			1
it came as a second capsule was completing drop tests off the @entity15 coast			1
@entity8 is scheduled for a test flight in early december			1
@entity23 divers adjust a tow line on a test version of the capsule as it is towed towards the @entity27 during a recovery drill off the coast of @entity15 during its dec. 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity35 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the @entity37 off the @entity39 coast			0
the entire mission will last 4½ hours			0
at @entity6 , the capsule — sealed for protection — slowly made its way to its fueling depot atop a 36 - wheel platform			0
the capsule and its attached service module and adapter ring stretched 40 feet high			0
' is n't this awesome ? ' said @entity6 's director , @entity50 , a former space shuttle commander			0
' this is our step to the future , the exploration of establishing a presence in the solar system			0
' space center employees lined up along the rope barricade to snap pictures of @entity8 , @entity0 's lofty follow - on to the now - retired space shuttle program			1
during its dec. 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space and take two big laps around @entity35 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the @entity37 off the @entity39 coast			1
the entire mission will last 4½ hours			0
the second @entity8 flight wo n't occur until around 2018 when another unmanned capsule soars atop @entity0 's new megarocket , still under development , called @entity74 for @entity74			1
@entity0 intends to put astronauts aboard @entity8 in 2021 for deep space exploration ; each capsule can accommodate up to four			1
the plan is to use @entity8 for getting humans to asteroids and @entity4 — no space station ferry trips for @entity8			2
while @entity8 may resemble an oversize @entity84 capsule on the outside , everything inside and out is modern and top - of - the - line , officials noted thursday			2
' i 'm as excited as can be , ' said @entity0 's @entity8 production operations manager , @entity88			1
the @entity74 rocket that will blast the capsule into orbit will be the largest ever built for @entity8 's dry run , the @entity93 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			2
a @entity103 rocket will do the heavy lifting			0
it will eventually be launced by @entity0 's new @entity74 ' megarocket '			0
for its first flight test , @entity74 will be configured for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity8 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit			1
in its most powerful configuration , @entity74 will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , which will enable missions even farther into our solar system , including such destinations as an asteroid and @entity4			0
@entity0 's @entity8 spacecraft , preparing for it 's first flight , arrives at the @entity20 at the @entity6 when asked by a reporter , @entity50 said he wishes @entity8 's flight pace was quicker			1
' but it is what it is , ' he said			0
' given the budget that we have , i think we 've got the best program that you could imagine			0
' @entity8 has its roots in the @entity132 shuttle era ; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low @entity35 orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the @entity138 project			2

@entity8 capsule will undergo first test flight in december
has also completed drop tests off the @entity15 coast
comes as @entity0 *bosses* *reveal* *private* contracts for shuttle *replacement* so they can concentrate on the project
