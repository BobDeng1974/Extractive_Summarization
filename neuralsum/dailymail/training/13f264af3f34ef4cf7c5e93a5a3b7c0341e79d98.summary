birth rates among @entity3 women rise by two thirds when they move to @entity5 , official figures showed yesterday			2
those who migrated here after 2004 have an average of 2.13 children compared with the 1.30 level seen in their native land			0
@entity12 have enjoyed an even bigger baby boom – producing 2.93 children in @entity5 but only 1.25 back home			1
new figures from the @entity17 shows women from @entity12 have the highest fertility rates in @entity20 and @entity21 the women may have been playing ‘ catch - up ’ after delaying pregnancy ahead of emigrating , the @entity17 said			1
but higher income – whether in wages or benefits – and better schools and living conditions in @entity5 , may also have encouraged the extra births , the agency added			0
its report on childbearing rates among @entity5 - born and foreign mothers suggests that the immigrants likely to come from @entity12 and @entity36 following the lifting of labour market restrictions in january will push up the @entity5 population with their offspring			1
@entity5 - born women in @entity20 and @entity21 have an average of 1.84 children in a lifetime the @entity17 report , based on 2011 and 2001 @entity5 census findings , and records held by the @entity49 statistics arm @entity48 , aimed to throw light on why birth rates among migrants are much higher than for their counterparts born in this country			1
the overall fertility rate of women born in @entity5 was 1.84 in 2011 – up 18 per cent since 2001			1
among foreign - born women , it was 20 per cent higher , at 2.21 births			2
the 2011 census recorded a 3.7million population increase in @entity20 and @entity21 over the decade , around two thirds of it brought about by immigration and high birth rates among migrant mothers			2
‘ fertility rates in @entity3 and @entity69 were very low , as in much of @entity70 and @entity71 , ’ the @entity17 said			0
‘ but the fertility rate of women born in these countries living in @entity20 and @entity21 was relatively high , above that of @entity5 - born women			1
’ the report said this meant migration was altering the childbearing rate of @entity71 women , or that women who migrate are different from those who stay at home			0
another explanation was that ‘ conditions were better in @entity20 and @entity21 for childbearing than in @entity3 or @entity69 ’			0
the report pointed to the catch - up effect , adding : ‘ if the support – financial , social , educational – for childbearing and family life is better or worse in @entity20 than in the population ’s country of origin , this may have an effect on the number of children they choose to have			2
’ @entity3 , @entity96 and @entity97 top the league table of countries by number of births fertility rates among migrants were highest among mothers from @entity105 and lowest among those from @entity107 and @entity108 , the @entity17 said			0
there were also low fertility rates among migrants from @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , where some @entity5 women who are now having children were born as daughters of @entity5 service families			1
women from @entity114 showed fertility rates of 1.1 , whereas mothers from other parts of @entity124 were much more prolific			0
the birth rate among women from @entity96 was 3.82 and from @entity127 4.25			0
@entity128 and @entity129 boasted among the highest figures – 5.58 and 4.32 respectively			0
women from @entity132 and @entity105 had fertility rates below @entity5 - born women .			1

total fertility rate - average number of children they can expect to have - for @entity12 women in @entity20 and @entity21 is 2.93
among women in @entity12 it is only 1.25 , and 1.84 for @entity5 - born mothers
