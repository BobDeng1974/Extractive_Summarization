she continues to describe how , even though heels are uncomfortable , you should ' stuff your ballet flats ' because men prefer you in heels			1

' i felt i no longer had to wear the straitjacket of the uniform of the professional woman who goes into an office every day			0

they want a woman who is confident , stylish and shows off what she has ( whatever it might be ) in an elegant manner			0
' in another post , @entity145 , @entity0 argues : ' nobody should ever be ashamed of their body ... but accepting your body and being proud of who you are does not mean you do n't also try to change it			1
' whether you agree with her or not , she 's not afraid to say it how she sees it .			0

@entity0 , *41* , ' developed an interest in fashion ' since moving to @entity75
she *advises* you should wear high heels even though they are painful , because ' your man wants to see you swing it '
she *advocates* exercising : ' accepting your body does not mean you do n't also try to change it '
praises @entity115 's ' glorious booty ' and says men were ' fed up to the back teeth with a constant diet of stick - thin , sexless models '
