@entity0 marked their relegation into @entity2 with a 1 - 1 draw against @entity4 , but the fireworks were restricted to outside of @entity7 as long - suffering supporters held protests against @entity11 chairman @entity10			1
the @entity13 ' demotion into the third tier was finally confirmed on @entity15 and that triggered pre-match public displays of fury from fans at the @entity22 family 's handling of the club on tuesday			1
dozens of supporters gathered outside the @entity27 45 minutes before kick - off and hurled eggs at the back of the directors ' boxes before a flare , smoke bomb and firework were tossed into the cordoned - off area in front of the main reception area			0
@entity37 scored from the penalty spot to give @entity0 a lead against @entity4 on tuesday night but defender @entity40 scored an own goal just after half - time to leave @entity42 disappointed @entity43 tussles with @entity45 international @entity44 , who enjoyed a rare start for @entity0 @entity0 : @entity47 ( @entity48 73 ) ; hall ( @entity49 50 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity44 , @entity37 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 78 ) , @entity56 ; @entity57 goal : @entity37 ( pen , 6 ) booked : @entity37 @entity4 : @entity60 ; @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ; @entity65 ( @entity66 45 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ; @entity43 ( @entity70 78 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 45 ) goal : hall ( @entity74 , 46 ) ref : @entity75 att : 9,614 with stewards and police present , the scenes did not descend into violence but the message delivered from those in attendance was clear - they want @entity83 to depart a team that this week became the first in the @entity86 to be relegated			1
on the pitch , @entity37 's early penalty was cancelled out by @entity40 's unfortunate own goal just 20 seconds after the restart as the basement - dwelling @entity11 ' winless run was extended to 13 games			1
some of the supporters who congregated in front of the @entity27 did not even walk into a half - empty stadium for the game and they missed their side taking a sixth - minute lead			0
@entity63 got the wrong side of @entity101 loanee @entity57 and tripped him from behind , allowing @entity37 to step up and stroke the resulting penalty into the corner as @entity60 guessed the wrong way			2
@entity0 fans gathered outside @entity7 to protest against the @entity10 family @entity0 's main reception at @entity7 was pelted with eggs before their game with @entity4 a fan walks out of a @entity112 shop , next to a shop selling t - shirts and banners supporting protests the cut - up pitch arguably denied the hosts a second as the ball bobbled away from @entity53 , who had orchestrated a three - on - two break , on the edge of the @entity4 ' penalty area			1
winger @entity56 then blasted into the side - netting from 25 yards as @entity0 entered the interval with a one - goal lead			2
that disappeared 20 seconds after the restart , though , when the @entity4 made a lightning start to the second period			0
@entity72 made inroads down the left flank and he squared for @entity43 , whose shot back across goal smashed against the unfortunate hall before going over the line			0
@entity40 stayed on the turf and after woozily returning to his feet , he was replaced by @entity49			0
@entity53 bent an effort narrowly past a post but @entity47 and @entity60 remained largely untroubled , as did @entity0 substitute @entity141 when he replaced an injured @entity142 , with @entity72 's header off target the closest either side came to a winner			2
the result leaves @entity42 's side on 25 points , still one point shy of the lowest points tally ever accumulated by a team in the second tier when there have been 24 teams competing .			0

@entity37 scored from the spot after just six minutes
but @entity40 's own goal gave @entity4 a share of the spoils
@entity0 fans protested against owners , the @entity10 family
the @entity11 need two more points to pass @entity168 's *26*
