@entity118 , the case presenter at the @entity29 , said yesterday : ' the baby ’s mother has a health condition and it is vitally important for her to get a good night ’s sleep			1
' her husband therefore invited the midwives to take the baby away so that his wife could get a good night ’s sleep			1
' that decision was not taken lightly			0
the nurse looking after @entity35 ’s mother was involved in that decision			0
it was the right thing to do			0

' i remember that the father of the baby came out of the room [ where his wife was sleeping ] at 2.30am , complaining that the mother could still hear the baby crying			0
she could therefore not sleep			0
' i recommended that the baby be cared for at the nursery , but ms @entity8 and ms @entity15 said they were coping ok and would keep the baby there			1
this decision was made jointly between the two midwives			0
' ms @entity146 , who has been a midwife at the hospital since 2001 , told the tribunal that she had two further encounters with the baby , when she fed and changed it			2
she continued : ' when i returned [ to the midwife station ] , @entity35 had been placed in darkened section of the area			0
ms @entity15 was looking after the baby at this time			1
' she was by the desk and @entity35 was fast asleep on [ its ] back			0
we do not allow babies under three months old to sleep on their front			0
' at 6am i went to the nurses ’ cupboard to retrieve my stethoscope , which i keep in my bag			0
at this time , @entity35 was still in her cot in the darkened area of the midwives ’ station			1
' i went to to my patients and when i returned back to the midwives station later i did not know where the baby was , but i assumed it had been taken back to its mother			1
' @entity65 said the baby was in a cupboard and it had vomited all over itself and it was suffocating in an airless cupboard			2
@entity35 was fast asleep and the sheets were clean			0
' ms @entity8 told me that the baby had not been in the cupboard			1
she told me that @entity35 had been wedged in the door way			0
' an internal investigation was carried out by the hospital which found that @entity35 had been overfed and there were poor records of the feedings			0

' i looked at the guidelines on the post-natal ward and found there was no applicable policy or procedures on how to act in these circumstances			0
' i discovered that @entity35 had been overfed , there were no clear records of the feeding			0
' i believe the baby had been overfed by the midwives			2
' i concluded that there were no care issues during the incident			0
' apart from @entity65 not one other person saw the baby in the cupboard and it was all denied from every person i spoke to			2
' if there had been more evidence of @entity35 being in the cupboard it absolutely would have triggered a care issue but i had no other evidence apart from one person			2
' @entity35 was a well baby so there would be no requirement for that baby to have a feeding chart			0
' the baby was fed although it was overfed			0
' a further investigation was carried out which then led to both nurses being suspended			0
@entity253 , associate human resources director at @entity19 , said : ' i was asked to investigate a complaint on april 20 in 2011 , raised by @entity65			0
' @entity91 was the named midwife and was unable to provide satisfactory care explanation for the duration of the shift			2
' there was a lack of clarity for who was caring for @entity262 ' miss @entity15 did have a significant level of involvement in the care of @entity35 , she could n't clearly outline the care when she had actually taken part in it			2
' @entity91 engaged with the process well and was consistent but miss @entity15 was unresponsive and unwilling to engage			2
' miss @entity144 was reluctant to accept responsibility for @entity271 ' the incident brought the hospital into disrepute due to the publicity in the @entity276 ' it exacerbated bad publicity we were experiencing as a trust , impacted on staff morale and the feelings of expectant mothers in the trust			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
