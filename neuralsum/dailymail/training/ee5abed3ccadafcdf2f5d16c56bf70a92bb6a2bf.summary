it was @entity2 ’s mother who first noticed something in her son ’s face that leads to his many deaths these days			1
‘ sometimes she would see me playing football or giving an interview and she would call me , ’ @entity2 says			1
‘ she would ask , “ why are you so sad , @entity2			1
why are you upset ? ” ‘ i would say , “ i am not sad , this is just my face			1
and you know my face ! ” but i guess she sees what the directors see			1
maybe it is a sad face , even if i am happy			2
it means i play a certain type of character and they die a lot			2
’ @entity22 and @entity23 star @entity2 has followed a career in acting @entity2 celebrates scoring for @entity23 against @entity25 in 1997 this is what @entity2 terms his ‘ second life ’ , more specifically the acting career that has followed the @entity30 and @entity31 he won , among other things , as a footballer player which sees the @entity35 follow in the footsteps of @entity38 legend @entity37			1
it is the life he always wanted , a dream that preceded the one he had to play football			1

some of his countrymen in @entity22 might stop sniggering			2
but it ’s a long journey for a legend of @entity23 ; it ’s many more deaths away			1
‘ maybe it is my face , ’ @entity2 says			1
‘ a lot of my characters have a deep , maybe dark side			2
‘ i have died many times			2
in my first play i was killed and i have done eight movies and been killed four times			2
i think i die well			2
‘ but i like these guys			2
i love to play something i am not			2
i try to be a nice guy in real life			1
in the movies i can kill people and be a bad guy and shout			2

that role was very intense , but good fun			0
