dr @entity20 , from @entity21 , best known as the star of the @entity25 series @entity20 's @entity26 holds the lost tarantula , showing how safe it is dr @entity20 , best known as the star of the @entity25 series @entity20 's @entity26 , said : ' it is unlikely that the spider would have travelled from distance , given the cold spring temperatures and the proximity of local houses			1
' the surrounding habitat offered little interest or cover for that species of spider , given that it mainly consists of large open fields which are patrolled by many aerial predators , including gulls and crows			2
' these birds would have easily spotted this tropical spider and , given half a chance , would have eaten her			2
' all things considered , the spider had a very lucky escape before a bird or cat killed it			0
' the @entity1 red rump , or @entity55 in @entity56 , was made famous in @entity58 's 1955 sci - fi movie @entity59 , where an ill - advised scientific experiment leads to a giant arachnid breaking out of captivity and terrorizing the @entity64 desert			0
luckily for the population of @entity67 , however , the creature is not aggressive , and is currently being looked after by @entity68 at @entity21			0
' the red rump tarantula does not present a significant health risk to the general public			0
in the rare case of the spider biting , the symptoms would be similar to that of a mild bee sting			0
' i 'm happy to report that no one was unnecessarily frightened by the appearance of this spider on the loose			0
' while the spider is now secure and recovering from its ordeal , anyone with nformation relating to this incident should either contact the local authority or the police on 101			1
' councillor @entity87 , cabinet member for communities , added : ' it 's not every day that you spot an exotic pet such as this outside of its home environment , so we are appealing for the owner to get in touch as soon as possible			1
