@entity30 , director of research at @entity15 , said this was because @entity27 already had the infrastructure , and added : â € ˜ a major shift is on the horizon , and the integration of mobiles into payments has only just begun			0
over a third ( 38 per cent ) were interested in making mobile payments - and an enthusiastic 8 per cent said they would apply right away ' as mobile payment and wallet services become more widely available , and more intuitive and efficient to use , it will be difficult for consumers to resist adopting them			1
' while just eight per cent of @entity47 claim they would apply for a mobile payment system straight away , across an adult population of around 50 million adults , that still represents a potential user base of four million people : there is a huge market out there if providers are able to come up with a product that represents a tangible upgrade to existing technology			1
' support for a cashless society is greatest in @entity27 where 30 per cent of residents would be happy to stop using cash altogether			1
however , the figure declines to just 13 per cent of those living in the @entity66 and @entity67 and 14 per cent of those living in the @entity69 and @entity70			0

' however , there are huge swathes of the population which remain attached to cash , and the reality is that cash still has a long life ahead of it			0
' cash remains the most widely and frequently used payment method in @entity4			1
researchers found 99 per cent of @entity47 use cash , and only debit cards come close to rivalling it			1
however , one in 50 @entity47 ( two per cent ) say they have never used a plastic card			1
mr @entity30 added : ' it is not about any one payment method			2
' people use multiple payment technologies , and if they can see a clear reason for changing their habits then they are willing to incorporate new ones , such as @entity104			0
' use of a particular payment method is largely determined by context			2
cash dominates for small transactions on the high street , but for online and for high value transactions , debit and plastic cards are the payment methods of choice			0

support greatest in @entity27 - 30 *%* of residents ready to get *rid* of cash
cash still most widely and frequently used payment method in @entity4
but one in 50 @entity47 ( two per cent ) say they have never used plastic card
