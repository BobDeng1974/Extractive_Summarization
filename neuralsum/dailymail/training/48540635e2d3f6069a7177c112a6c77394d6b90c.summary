@entity33 , prosecuting , said : ' @entity6 was subjected to at least two , possibly more , episodes of violence or trauma in her short life			1
' seven - week old @entity6 was found ' limp , pale and lifeless ' by paramedics after @entity6 dialled 999 in april last year he added : ' both defendants admit that @entity6 was in their care at all material times			1
how she came to suffer so many injuries with such a catastrophic effect is only known by the two defendants			0
' a post-mortem examination found bruising and grazes to her head and face , internal bruising to her scalp , two distinct trauma injuries to her skull , bleeding to the brain and eyes , healing rib fractures and healing fractures to the left thigh and shin bone			1
mr @entity60 said : ' @entity6 was subjected to at least two and quite possibly more episodes of violence or trauma at different times to different parts of her body , including her head , ribcage and left leg			1
' the injuries relating to the brain , the eyes and bleeding to the surface of the brain were indicative of violent shaking			0
' the fractures to the skull establish that there was a significant blunt force applied to the head			2
' the fractures to the ribs and to the left leg established that she had been subjected to violence to those parts of her body			1
' both defendants were arrested and interviewed by police			2
mr @entity60 said @entity6 and @entity16 , from @entity89 , @entity20 , @entity21 , both refused to tell the truth to police			1
he told the court that @entity16 and @entity6 had started a relationship in early 2011 with @entity16 falling pregnant in may that year , after which they were seen by social workers			1
mr @entity60 said : ' the relationship between the defendants was at times volatile			0
@entity99 were able to hear frequent arguments involving shouting , banging and swearing			0
' the last of such arguments was heard during the night of april 11			0
a male voice was heard to shout and swear and a female voice was heard to be crying and shouting back			0
' mr @entity60 also told the jury that @entity6 was seen at home in @entity20 , @entity21 , by a midwife and health visitor			2
she was weighed and examined and it was noticed that she was losing weight in the weeks up to her death			0
the court heard a health visitor attended the family home eight days before her death and again two days before her death - but apart from losing weight , explained by @entity16 and @entity6 as the baby vomiting , there were no injuries noticed by the health visitor			1
@entity6 was also seen by a gp on april 3 - but ' nothing unusual ' was noticed by the doctor during a physical check , the jury was told			2
at just before 7am on april 12 , @entity6 called 999 and paramedics were sent to the house			2

he told paramedics that he had been up all night watching her			0
@entity6 was rushed to hospital but despite the efforts of medical staff , died at 2.50am the next day			2
mr @entity60 said : ' the opinion of the pathologist is that @entity6 was subjected to at least two and quite possibly more episodes of trauma at different times to different parts of her body , including her head , rib cage and left leg			1
' at the very least , say the prosecution , the defendants should have been aware , if they were not inflicting these injuries , that @entity6 needed help			0
' if either of the defendants was not involved in causing such catastrophic injuries to @entity6 , then it was a simple task to remove her fro the violence being inflicted by the perpetrator			0
' how difficult could it have been to take @entity6 away from the house to a place of safety if there was any risk of serious injury being caused to her ? ' the court heard that , during interviews , @entity6 told the police he did not know how his daughter had been injured			1
but later , he went on to say how @entity16 had ' slammed the baby ' into the changing mat and sofa			0
@entity16 also at first denied knowing how @entity6 ’s injuries had occurred , but then told police @entity6 would shake the baby to wake her up			1
she also later requested another interview with police , telling them : ' it was @entity15 who did it ' , describing hearing ' bangs ' while he and @entity6 were in another room			1
mr @entity60 added : ' how could these defendants not have known how those injuries were caused ? ' how difficult would it have been , you may ask yourselves , to have sought help for @entity6 ? ' there were plenty of opportunities - telling the health visitor when she visited , telling the @entity123 at the doctors , talking to their parents who lived nearby and were in regular contact , simply picking @entity198 up and walking out of that house , to be away from the perpetrator of the cruel violence			0
' whether they caused @entity6 ’s death themselves , separately or together , or they failed to take all reasonable steps to protect her from the serious and obvious risk of injury to her at the hands of the other , the prosecution say that they are both guilty of causing or allowing the death of @entity6			0
