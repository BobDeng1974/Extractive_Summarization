they ’ve supported the @entity1 as she goes about her royal duties for almost 50 years , looking decorous yet never detracting attention from their sovereign , and accompanying her everywhere from prison visits to her @entity6			1
and these valuable servants ? not equerries or other royal minions , but her trusty patent leather shoes , the unsung heroes of the royal household			0
it takes a team of four — not including the junior member of @entity16 staff , dubbed ‘ @entity17 ’ , who has the job of wearing in her majesty ’s shoes — to produce the classic black numbers ( she has other colours in the same style ) which cost about £ 1,000			1
yet the @entity1 certainly gets value for money out of them , wearing the same pair for years and re-heeling them when they wear out			1
politics change , and so , gradually , does the monarch ’s style of dress			0
the coats have become narrower , the hemlines slightly longer			0
only her majesty ’s shoes remain emphatically the same			0
at 88 , the @entity1 relies on her shoes to be less glass slipper , more steadfast slip - on			1
comfort and support are key			1
as a young woman she often wore shoes with a thinner , higher heel , but for nearly 50 years the same low style has kept her sure - footed and age - defyingly nimble			0
known as her ‘ work ’ shoes , they are handmade for her by shoemaker @entity65 of @entity67 , @entity68 , from the finest calf leather , usually in black patent with a brass clasp or a small bow			1
the team works from a wooden ‘ last ’ made from measurements of the @entity1 ’s foot , and include a pattern cutter ; a clicker , who selects the leather ; a closer , who sews the upper part and adds stiffeners ; and , finally , a maker , who adds the sole and heel on the last			1
left : these @entity87 shoes worn in 1969 are brown , with a short tongue - but the pattern had been set			0
in 1975 ( right ) the @entity1 was feeling summery in @entity91 - the style she 'd keep for years , seen here in white left : the dress worn in 1984 is from another era , but the black patent shoes are becoming a fixture			1
then in 1987 ( right ) the @entity1 was elegant in @entity98 - and her shoes have since survived the reign of @entity101 then there ’ll be a fitting at the @entity16 , and — after any final adjustments , including a clean and polish — they ’re ready			1
the @entity1 ’s selection — she has worked her way through hundreds of almost identical pairs over the years but circulates about ten pairs at any one time — includes plain black leather , black patent , white leather and beige leather , and three designs of evening shoe in satin , silver and gold			2
they are all hand - dyed and water - repellent			0
the heel is always reassuringly chunky and 2¼ in high , with a raised insole to give the royal size 4s an added lift in the arch. if she is likely to be walking on uneven surfaces , the heel will be lower			0
but even having them handmade is n’t quite enough to get them fit for a @entity1			1
@entity133 , who has designed dresses for her for 11 years says that the shoes have to be immediately comfortable and that to achieve this , a member of staff with the same size feet will trot up and down palatial corridors for her until they are suitably broken in			1
@entity143 in 1990 , and the @entity1 is being blown about ( left ) — but the shoes keep her steady			1
then in 1993 , ( left ) glancing down at her feet — yes , the shoes are still the same — at @entity147 at @entity149 time left : in @entity150 , in fur , in 1994			2
the @entity152 has collapsed , but the trusty slip - on is eternal			0
by 1996 ( right ) she has long since dispensed with boxy jackets , but the patent leather remains on a visit to a criminal court @entity133 says : ‘ @entity1 can never say : “ i ’m uncomfortable , i ca n’t walk any more			2
” ’ once she has taken delivery , her dressers @entity160 or @entity161 might also use wooden shoe stretchers to make them more comfortable			0
her shoes have occasionally been ‘ worn in ’ by @entity165 , her devoted personal assistant , as they have almost the same size feet			2
but now there is the aforementioned junior staff member ‘ @entity17 ’ , who is the same size exactly			1
she wears beige cotton ankle socks when testing the @entity1 ’s shoes , and is only allowed to walk on carpets			1
the shoes then get one trial run outside to ensure there is no slippage			0
@entity177 and @entity178 are responsible for everyday care , including polishing and storage			0
after the @entity1 has worn them , they are aired on shoe trees then stored individually in silk or cotton drawstring bags			2
originally the @entity1 ’s shoes were made by @entity87 , a @entity188 family firm founded in 1885 to make theatrical shoes for actresses such as @entity191 ( @entity192 ’s mistress )			1
co-ordinating with the black fur trim on this fuchsia pink coat in 2004 ( left ) and a jolly queen in 2006 ( right ) over the @entity197 : presidents may come and go — but not the shoes , seen here on a visit to the @entity202 in 2007 ( left )			0
in 2008 , right , the shoes of @entity149 past enjoy yet another festive outing at @entity147 the @entity1 came to @entity87 in the early @entity206 , recommended by the @entity207 , who had followed in the footsteps of another impeccable royal dresser , her mother - in - law @entity210 , who issued the company with a @entity213 in 1936			1
at the height of its success the company made the shoes for @entity217 in her role as @entity219			2
@entity220 and @entity221 designed shoes for them , and princess @entity224 and @entity225 got married in @entity87 creations ; as did the @entity1 herself : a pair ( there were actually three identical pairs in case of disasters ) of beige silk sling - back sandals with a medium heel and a small platform sole			1
( she is almost a foot shorter than @entity41 , who is 6ft 1in			0
) @entity238 was also a fan			0
a pair of her favourite black @entity87 satin stilettos were put up at auction last year for £ 150			1
@entity242 and princess @entity243 wore @entity87 , too			0
the company ’s shoes were all the rage for a time , and had nearly 70 stores and four factories when run by the founder ’s grandson @entity87			0
but on a trip to @entity252 he accidentally revealed the @entity1 ’s shoe size to a journalist at a cocktail party and the unknown fact was splashed across newspapers on both sides of the @entity197			2
@entity87 was summoned to the @entity16 by courtiers and was eventually forgiven			2
in 2009 , pictured , @entity1 added contrast to the blaze of red to greet wellwishers in @entity264 another day , another decade — an elegant ensemble for the @entity6 in 2012 ( left )			2
fast forward to now and the trusty £ 1,000 shoes were still going strong this week as the @entity1 visited @entity268 ( right ) he would visit @entity16 six times a year			1
a royal source said : ‘ occasionally , the @entity1 would produce a pair with a chewed heel , asking mr @entity87 if he could repair the damage caused by a playful corgi			1
’ twenty years ago , like most of the @entity188 shoe - making industry , @entity87 went out of fashion — and production			0
ever loyal , the @entity1 knighted @entity279			2
but she was said to be so distraught at losing her beloved shoemaker that courtiers tracked down a former employee of @entity87 , @entity282 , who , by then , was working for another shoemaker , @entity65			2
with help from the @entity16 , @entity285 recovered the @entity1 ’s old lasts from the liquidators			1
@entity289 & @entity290 , founded in 1922 , still make dance and theatre shoes , just like @entity87 in the early days			0
in the @entity206 , they were on the feet of every star , from the @entity296 to @entity297			0
but the @entity1 is one of their most enduring customers			0
according to @entity282 : ‘ we supply one or two pairs a year and occasionally renew the tops and re-heel them			0
@entity1 does n’t waste money			1

it takes a team of four to produce classic numbers at £ 1,000 a pair
but she certainly saves money , reheeling them when they wear out
a junior member of @entity16 staff has the job of making the shoes comfier
they are handmade by @entity65 of @entity67 , west @entity68
*experts* use a wooden ' last ' made from measurements of @entity1 's feet
comfort , support and simplicity mean the design is a firm favourite
