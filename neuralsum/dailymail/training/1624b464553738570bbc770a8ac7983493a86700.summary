@entity7 artist @entity6 uses a scanning electron microscope to delve into the fabric of petals , leaves and pollen , creating a stunning collection of plants from sunflowers to pansies			1
the @entity7 artist then ' colours the images in ' using a computer to show off remarkable textures that can not be seen with the naked eye			1
vibrant : these apricot flower stamens were captured using an electron microscope by @entity7 artist @entity6 intricate : the stigma of an @entity27 cactus flower where the female sex cells ripen to form a fruit that contains the plant 's seeds dazzling : geranium pollen grains , which form the male sex cells of a flowering plant mr @entity6 said : ' almost everything on earth has been captured by photographers , but there is unknown beauty still waiting to be discovered in the micro world			1
the eye - opening collection includes geranium pollen , aubergine flower petals , pansies , lilies and the hibiscus plant			0
mr @entity6 originally trained as a graphic designer at university			2
whilst there he visited a lab and saw a scanning electron microscope being used first - hand			2
he was allowed a go on the machine and became hooked			0
detail : zooming right in on the glowing yellow rape petals , showing the papillae , lumps that help to reduce water loss from the petal @entity60 : the luminous pink of a suckling clover 's soft petals beautiful : the buttercup flower 's orange pistil surrounded by the pink stamens the high - cost equipment is able to produce images of the tiniest particles by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons			0
mr @entity6 has since had many books published and exhibitions commissioned in his native @entity7			1
he also takes remarkable pictures inside the human body , showing incredible levels of detail in the digestive system			0
bizarre : the microscope is zoomed in close enough to see the tiny epidermal hairs on the aubergine flower petal rough texture : the pansy petal is covered in cone - shaped hairs , which are brightly - coloured and scented to attract insects miniscule : a stigma of a sunflower plant , which is curled over here , holding the orange pollen grains @entity92 : orchids zoomed right into their open flowers			0
