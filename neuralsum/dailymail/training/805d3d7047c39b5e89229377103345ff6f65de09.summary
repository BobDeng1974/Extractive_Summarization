however , new research suggests that the shape of a man ’s face can indicate whether he is likely to be a good sportsman			0
the study , carried out at @entity14 , found that @entity16 baseball players with short , broad faces are more likely to display acumen on the sports field			1
@entity16 baseball players with short , broad faces , like @entity21 , are more likely to display acumen on the sports field , according to new research testosterone is a hormone which is primarily secreted in the testicles of men and the ovaries of women			1
it is the principal male sex hormone and plays a key role in the development of male reproductive organs			0
it is also responsible for promoting increases in muscle , bone mass and growth of body hair			0
on average , adult men have seven to eight times more testosterone in their blood than women do			0
it also showed that sportsmen with long faces are less likely to be successful baseball players			1
it is believed the explanation could be that having a wider jaw is an indication of having high levels of the hormone testosterone and that this plays a part in determining physical strength and aggression			2
the researchers , psychologists @entity58 and @entity60 , measured the facial width - to - height ratio of 104 baseball players in @entity65 ’s professional league			1
they then followed the players for the 2011 and 2012 seasons and discovered that the players who scored the highest number of home runs also had the highest facial width - to - height ratio			1
in a paper published in the @entity75 journal @entity76 , the researchers explained that this new data suggests that the findings may apply to people of all nationalities			2
the researchers believe that the findings also apply to people of other nationalities so it could apply to sports stars such as @entity86 ( left ) and sir @entity87 ( right ) they wrote that previous research has uncovered a link between the facial width - to - height ratio and the financial success of business leaders – this research suggested that @entity94 with broader faces are more likely to run successful firms			1
this work looked at @entity94 so the @entity16 research implies that testosterone has the same effect on both face shape and success regardless of your nationality			2
the study also revealed that younger players tended to have broader faces than older ones			0
however , the researchers are currently unable to explain why this might be .			0

@entity16 baseball players with broad faces more likely to hit home runs
could be because testosterone causes both a wide jaw and strength
findings are thought to apply to people of all nationalities
