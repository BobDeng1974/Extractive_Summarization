@entity0 ! sir @entity1 has long observed that @entity4 musical ‘ is a law unto itself ’ — and how so			2
after more than a decade of performances in cities all over the world , it was confirmed this week that the stage show is the biggest beast in the jungle			1
@entity4 — based on the 1994 @entity13 film of the same name — has taken more money at the box office than any other production in history			1
@entity4 - based on the 1994 @entity13 film - has taken more money at the box office than any other show since its first night on @entity24 in 1997 , the show has made more than £ 3.8 billion in ticket sales alone			1
not only has it conquered the stage , it has massively out - earned every cinema release — including blockbusters such as @entity30 , which took a mere £ 1.7 billion globally after its 2009 release			1
a further fortune has been made in souvenir t - shirts , posters and the rest			1
at the last count , there were eight different cast recordings of the show ’s songs on sale			1
featuring music by sir @entity1 and lyrics by sir @entity44 , @entity4 opened in @entity45 in july 1997 before moving to @entity24 in november that year			1
it arrived at the @entity47 in @entity49 ’s @entity48 in october 1999 and currently takes more than £ 30 million a year in the @entity50			1
@entity4 stage production arrived at the @entity47 in @entity49 ’s @entity48 ( above ) in october 1999 a story with bite the musical tells the story of @entity56 , a lion cub born on the @entity58 who runs away from his pride when his father @entity61 dies			1
aided by his friends , he must defeat his evil uncle @entity64 , who engineers @entity61 ’s death in a stampede and convinces @entity56 he was to blame , to reclaim his rightful position as king			2
the @entity71 according to music historian @entity73 , the musical is a ‘ spectacle that satisfies ’ on many different levels			2
‘ for the kids , it ’s the visual elements , the colours , the costumes and the puppetry , ’ he says			2
‘ for the adults , it ’s @entity84			2
’ many have noted the parallels between @entity13 ’s and @entity88 ’s plots , which both feature a murdered king avenged by his rightful heir			2
there are 22 @entity4 productions in the world , which have been seen by an estimated 75 million people going global @entity13 says that the 22 @entity4 productions around the world have been seen by an estimated 75 million people			2
that ’s the entire population of the @entity50 , plus the population of @entity99			2
last year , it was the highest - grossing musical on the @entity102 stage , and it retains its number - one position so far in 2014			1
it has always been a sell - out in @entity49			0
money matters @entity13 dipped its toe in the water with a @entity24 version of its @entity109 - winning @entity108 before pouring an estimated £ 6.5 million into staging @entity4 — the most expensive show ever staged			1
the stage guru in a colossal creative gamble , @entity13 hired @entity113 , an avant garde director who had trained in mime in @entity115 and spent years studying @entity117 and @entity118 theatre			0
@entity113 thought the film ‘ superficial ’			0
she said : ‘ i had to make @entity4 my own			0
otherwise it ’s a @entity13 product and i do n’t like the way @entity13 looks			0
’ since its first night on @entity24 in 1997 , the show has made more than £ 3.8 billion in ticket sales alone we need a heroine ! @entity113 ’s great visual innovation was using puppetry , masks and mechanical headpieces to portray the animals			1
when the lions cry , they pull rolls of white silk from their masks ’ eye holes ; the actors playing giraffes walk on stilts			0
the drought that ravages the savannah is illustrated by a dwindling waterhole — a circle of silvery material that shrinks as it is pulled across the stage			0
there were other changes , too : the stage production has more songs than the film ; and @entity150 , the baboon with mystic powers , became a ‘ she ’ , as @entity113 felt that the film lacked a leading female character			1
a stampede for seats in the immediate aftermath of its @entity24 debut , there were reports of pushy @entity102 parents putting their children ’s names down for theatre tickets years in advance			0
at one point seats were reselling for up to ten times their face value			0
things have since calmed down , but a ticket to the @entity49 production costs at least £ 27.50 a seat			1
the critics ’ verdict ‘ visually breathtaking , ’ said the @entity175			0
‘ @entity177 , exhilarating theatre , unlike anything ever seen on @entity24 , ’ cheered @entity176			0
but not everyone was convinced			0
one critic who saw the show open in @entity49 ’s @entity48 wrote that once the last @entity185 drum had fallen silent , a tiny part of him was left whispering : ‘ so what ? ’ catch it immediately , he said , thinking it was not destined to run and run			1
and the late , great @entity190 opined : ‘ a lot of people say , “ this is not real theatre			0
it ’s theatre by way of the movies , or by way of the theme park			0
” it ’s @entity192 , if you like			0
’ a ticket to the @entity49 production in the @entity48 costs around £ 27.50 a seat and shows are often sold - out stars in @entity205 celebrities including @entity207 , @entity208 , model @entity209 and former spice girl @entity210 attended the opening night in @entity49			1
@entity212 said that they had been moved to tears and ovations			0
@entity207 said afterwards : ‘ i do n’t want to be in any play in the future where an elephant does n’t walk down the aisle			0
’ but the show has not brought in big - name stars to fill seats , instead relying on talented ensemble casts			1
spooking the phantom even though twice as many paying punters have seen @entity227 ’s long - running @entity224 , @entity4 ’s steeper ticket prices and larger theatres mean its earnings are greater			1
@entity230 ’s enough , @entity231 zazu the hornbill ’s big musical number , @entity232 , was cut from the show in 2010 , making the show nine minutes shorter			2
@entity1 ( above ) wrote hit melodies for @entity4 film , including @entity239 , many of which have been used on the stage version @entity244 ’s @entity243 no one will say how much sir @entity1 was paid for licensing his melodies for @entity4 film — such as the hit @entity239 — to be used in the stage version			0
what can be noted is that @entity253 his annual income was said to stand at around £ 12 million a year			1
more recently , @entity254 put it at £ 48 million a year			1
@entity256 buoyed by @entity4 ’s success , sir @entity1 was then involved in two musicals : @entity259 , which had minor success , and @entity261 , based on @entity263 ’s gothic novels about an 18th - century nobleman turned vampire			0
that was a thumping disaster and closed after 39 performances in 2005			0
he stepped back into the world of musical theatre that year with the hugely popular @entity271 — though he did tell an interviewer in 2011 : ‘ just between you , me and the gatepost , i ’m not really a lover of musicals			2
’ @entity277 the show is completed by the music of @entity281 composer @entity280 , who was exiled to @entity282 in 1979 after student riots in @entity284			2
he told the @entity286 : ‘ @entity4 is not necessarily political , but i could relate to the life of @entity56 , a young cub who grows up in exile and goes back to fight for his country			0
