@entity6 , who lives in @entity7 , @entity8 , with her mother , hated the way she looked because of her nose ever ' since she can remember '			1

while she has ' always wanted surgery ' , @entity6 finally booked herself in for an operation in march			1
two months ago , the public relations executive underwent a rhinoplasty procedure performed by cosmetic surgeon @entity29 of @entity30 in @entity31			1
her family , including an older brother and sister , were concerned			2
' i did n't really speak with them			2
they said i did n't need it done , but that 's their point of view , ' says @entity6			1
' for a decade people have been making comments on it			0
it made me feel worse about it than i already felt			0
she says her nose made it difficult for her to talk to people or feel good about herself @entity6 's nose before surgery ( left ) and how the surgeon predicts it will look after swelling has gone down ( right ) ' one boy at school would comment on it ... my nose made me really lacking in confidence			1
it made it more difficult to talk to people or feel good about myself			0
' whenever i would meet someone new i would immediately think " are they going to think i 've got a big nose "			1
' it was the first thing i worried about			2
i would just feel really insecure			0
' i 'd always wanted the operation but in march this year i decided i was actually going to do it and booked myself in			0
' i wanted to raise my confidence and help me find a man			1
' @entity6 went in in the morning , the operation was two hours , and was home by 8pm her close friends would say her nose was fine			1
but they would sometimes make jokes about it , and paranoid @entity6 took these to heart			1
' my friends were probably saying it was fine to be polite			0
they knew i hated my nose and wanted it done , ' she says			1
' i went for the consultation and dr @entity29 looked at my nose and what needed to be done , and explained the process			2
i trusted him on that - at the time that 's all that mattered			0

' two months on , the results are only going to get better			0
' i still ca n't move the tip of my nose , it 's absolutely solid			2
that can take 6 months to go down , ' says @entity6			1
' some people say it does n't look very different , but the surgeons do it so subtly so as not to make a drastic change			2
when i look at pictures before and now , that 's when i really notice it			0
' while i feel much more confident , i have n't been on any dates yet - but i am very fussy and picky , i just have n't found the right one			0
' i 've tried dating sites but would rather meet someone in person			0

' and when i am with someone one day , to not feel insecure about the way i look			0
' @entity6 , pictured just after surgery ( l ) and recently ( r ) , ca n't feel the ' solid ' tip of her nose yet , but feels much more confident about her appearance			1
