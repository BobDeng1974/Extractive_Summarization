by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 21:01 est , 10 december 2013 walks free : fireworks display organiser @entity2 leaves @entity4 yesterday as he was cleared of causing the deaths of seven and injuring 51 on the @entity6 a fireworks organiser accused of causing a motorway crash that killed seven and injured 51 says the authorities wanted ' someone to blame ' as he was cleared of breaching health and safety law yesterday			1
a judge directed a jury at @entity4 to find @entity2 , 51 , not guilty of a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others contrary to the @entity17			1
seven people died in a massive motorway pile - up involving more than 30 cars when they were engulfed by a thick fog on the @entity6 near @entity22 at around 8.20pm on november 4 2011			1
the smog was so thick that motorists on the northbound carriageway likened it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens			0
@entity2 , 51 , said he believed the decision to prosecute him was ' motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident , simply for the sake of doing so '			1
speaking outside @entity4 , he said : ' i would like to start by expressing my sympathy to all those who were affected by the terrible crash on november 4 2011			1
' i have been through an appalling experience over the last two years , yet i recognise that my misfortune is as nothing compared with that of those bereaved and injured as a result of that accident			2
judge @entity45 , who directed the jury at @entity4 to return a verdict of not guilty , said : ' the prosecution case required mr @entity2 to appreciate and react more or less instantly to something not thought to be a hazard to anyone and had no previous reason to think it was a hazard			1
' he added : ' there was no proper basis that you could have concluded that a reasonable person would have appreciated a reasonable risk and reacted to it to stop the display			2
' mr @entity2 was in charge of the massive event at a rugby club which saw 1,500 rockets fired during a 15 minute display			1
through his solicitor , @entity66 , mr @entity2 said outside court : ' before a final decision to go ahead with the display was taken , the @entity71 , the @entity72 and the @entity73 were consulted			1
' all were informed of the fact and nature of the display			2
no objection of any kind was raised			0
as matters transpired , the @entity72 and @entity73 were to be the agencies which prosecuted me in respect of that same display			2
' the display was carried out without incident			2
it was a very foggy night and the fireworks produced some smoke , which would have mingled with the fog			0
' however , i saw nothing to cause me to believe that any firework smoke would cause a hazard and i do not believe that it did so '			0
mr @entity2 continued : ' the prosecution case against me was based on the suggestion that i should have recognised the risk of something occurring which has never been shown to have happened before , which probably did not happen , and risk of which was not recognised by anyone else			1
' the judge noted when he ruled that there was no case to answer , the prosecution case was ' heavily weighted with hindsight "			1
message : fireworks contractor @entity2 , 51 , ( right ) with a member of his legal team , @entity66 ( centre ) , who said the authorities who agreed to the display then sought to blame his client tragedy : the @entity6 in @entity117 on november 5 2011 , the day after the fireworks display designed by @entity2 , who was cleared of any wrongdoing yesterday ' as many people will be aware , the assistant chief constable of @entity122 ( @entity124 ) @entity123 appeared on national television less than 48 hours after the crash to advance the police belief that smoke from the display had caused the crash			1
carnage : the horrifying result of the @entity6 crash , which happened in conditions drivers described as like having paint on their windscreens ' hours before the pronouncement was made , officers from @entity141 and @entity73 had unlawfully obtained a warrant to search my home , as the judge found during the trial			1
' the unlawful search of my home took place despite the fact that i had previously expressly confirmed to the police my willingness to co-operate with their inquiry in any way			1
' the current proceedings were brought jointly by the @entity73 and @entity72			0
prior to the proceedings being brought , those representing me wrote to @entity72 highlighting the obvious flaws in the case			2
' those concerns were simply ignored			0
again , in august of this year , those representing me set out in court documents the very issues which caused the case to come to a halt			2
nevertheless , the prosecution continued			0
' i am obviously extremely relieved that i have been cleared of any blame for this terrible crash			2
so , whilst i am very relieved that , more than two years later , my ordeal is over , i continue to feel that my prosecution was motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident , simply for the sake of doing so			2
' it was alleged that mr @entity2 , of @entity175 in @entity117 , failed to ensure he operated the firework display so as to ensure , as far as was reasonably practicable , that others who might be affected were not exposed to risks to their health and safety			1
mr @entity2 was originally charged with seven counts of manslaughter but they were dropped earlier this year and instead he faced the health and safety charge			1
grandparents @entity124 and @entity186 , from @entity187 , @entity188 ; father and daughter @entity189 and @entity191 , from @entity192 , @entity193 ; battle re-enactor @entity194 , from @entity195 , @entity117 ; and lorry drivers @entity196 , from @entity198 , and @entity199 , from @entity200 , died and 51 people were injured , including some seriously , in the pile - up			1
mr @entity2 , who ran @entity203 , was the contractor hired by @entity205 to run the Â£ 3,000 display at its ground , which was watched by 1,000 people			1
he set off 1,500 shots as part of his @entity211 in 15 minutes - just 200 yards from the motorway			2
in a leaflet promoting his business , the experienced mr @entity2 described the display as the ' biggest and most lavish ' piece of ' unforgettable ' pyrotechnics he offered			1
much loved : @entity124 and @entity186 who were amongst those killed in fatal crash on the @entity6 near @entity22 , @entity117 , in november 2011 victims : @entity194 ( top left ) , @entity222 lorry driver @entity196 ( top right ) , former soldier and lorry driver @entity199 ( bottom left ) and @entity191 ( bottom right ) , all killed in the crash on the @entity6 near @entity22 witnesses described seeing the smoke drift across the nearby carriageway			1
@entity231 , prosecuting , told the jury : ' essentially the prosecution say they experienced a loss of visibility , generated , we say , by a plume of smoke created by mr @entity2 from his firework display which had built up			1
bereft : @entity241 , whose family members died in the accident on the @entity6 , and spoke on behalf of all victims , said that she was ' devastated ' by what had happened ' it was dispersed because of the lack of wind mixed with the humid air and drifted in the direction of the motorway			0
' we say people were exposed to an appreciable risk to their personal safety that night as a consequence of the way mr @entity2 prepared for and then went about his business			1
' we say that ensuring the safety of people using that motorway needed particular care if you were going to undertake a big firework display involving the use of a substantial volume of these hazardous explosives , which generated a lot of smoke			2
' smoke can have an appreciable effect on reducing visibility - that should be obvious			0
it did n't take long from the build - up of smoke to the dramatic loss of visibility			0
' we say if he had adequately undertaken his health and safety properly , some or all of the consequences which unfolded on november 4 may have been avoided			1
' @entity241 , from @entity283 , @entity188 , and daughter of @entity2 and mrs @entity186 , said : ' i am speaking on behalf of all the families here and we are all absolutely devastated			2
' we feel that things should have gone a little bit further and the judge should have made more of an informed decision			0
' i am really upset			0
i am very , very cross about what happened			0
' i am just devastated and i am really upset and , to be honest , as much as there has been a picture brought up over the last few weeks , there is still a lot of confusion			0
' i think a lot of money has been wasted and i think there are things that could have been done that have n't been done			0
' i would have liked to have seen the defence witnesses before the case was stopped			0
' pile - up : the emergency services consider the situation on the night that seven died and 51 were injured on the @entity6 in 2011 aftermath : view of the wreckage which shows burnt out cars along the @entity6 where seven people died @entity4 heard that the smog built up during and after a fireworks display at @entity205 and drifted across the road pile - up : one driver said her car hit a patch of white mist as it entered the @entity6 at junction 25 ms @entity186 said she still believed it was right to bring the prosecution			1
' i think perhaps health and safety are at fault for their guidance			0
despite having evidence , their guidance is not clear , ' she said			0
@entity332 , leader of @entity72 , said : ' i hope that the end of @entity335 proceedings brings some closure for the families , friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives or suffered injury in the terrible events on november 4 2011			1
' the council is now seeking to work closely with the relevant authorities to see if the current guidance regarding large fireworks displays , such as the one at @entity205 , is appropriate			0
' we also pledge our support for any changes that may be deemed necessary			0
our primary concern is to minimise the risks of this type of unimaginable incident happening again			0
' on behalf of the council , i would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the families of the bereaved and the families and friends of all those affected by these terrible events			0
' i would also pay tribute to all those who showed such bravery at the scene , to all the emergency services and to staff at the hospitals where the injured were treated			0
' there will be a coroner 's inquest in due course and the coroner may make recommendations having heard the evidence laid before the inquest			0
