@entity0 is happy to concede centre stage to @entity2 when the former school friends start their first @entity5 match together in saturday 's @entity6 against @entity7			1
@entity2 , the @entity9 's form fly - half , has been told ' you 're the boss , so get bossing ' by @entity11 as the head coach seeks to address the lack of tried and tested depth in the position			1
as @entity11 's first - choice 10 for most of his reign , @entity0 has become accustomed to the role of team general and the vocal 23 - year - old is at ease with the responsibility of giving orders			1
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 are in good spirits during @entity5 's captain 's run at @entity26 @entity27 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity29 walk onto the @entity26 pitch for their final team run on friday but against the big - hitting @entity33 he must play second fiddle at inside centre , taking directions from @entity29 and relinquishing the goalkicking duties he treasures			1
' it 's @entity2 's first start so it 's good for him to have the whole responsibility			1
i know he 'll be brilliant , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 'll love it and it 's good that he 's going into the game with the whole package			0
i agree with what 's happening			0
i 'll concentrate on my job , which is helping him out			0
@entity0 will partner his @entity52 team - mate @entity51 in the centre against the hard - tackling @entity7 2008 @entity5 under 16 teammates			1
@entity0 captained the side , @entity29 had just turned 15			1
2008 - 09 @entity5 under 18 team - mates			2
toured @entity57 together in 2008			0
2011 @entity5 under 20 teammates			2
lost 33 - 22 to @entity63 in @entity65 final			0
2014 @entity29 made senior debut off the bench at @entity26 as a replacement for @entity0 against @entity69 in the @entity62			1
' i like the responsibility of goalkicking , but i 'll not be too down - heartened about not doing it because i have a job to concentrate on			2
' despite his competitive nature , @entity0 does not resent losing his cherished fly - half jersey to his former @entity5 age grade team - mate			1
' i 'm chuffed to be playing			0
i did n't for one second think that even if things were going brilliantly and we were winning every game that i was going to start every game from now until whenever , ' @entity0 said			2
' i 've never been that naive to think i 'd play every game			0
this is a chance to try something different			0
' @entity11 has been longing for the chance to start @entity29 and @entity0 as twin playmakers , a partnership that has only been seen briefly during the @entity90 21 - year - old 's previous appearances as a replacement			1
but the selection has drawn criticism with @entity94 forced to deny @entity0 is ' undroppable ' in response to his poor performances in the three - point defeats by @entity63 and @entity58			2
former @entity5 scrum - halves @entity98 and @entity100 have also questioned the logic of picking a fly - half like @entity2 , who stands flat and attacks the line , only to then deploy a limited offensive midfield outside him in @entity0 and @entity51			1
@entity29 ( left ) played alongside @entity0 ( right ) for @entity5 at the @entity105 in 2011 the head coach referenced @entity108 's occasional presence alongside @entity109 in the 2003 @entity65 - winning team in explaining the need to develop the option of having two fly - halves in the backline and @entity0 gives his view on how his partnership with @entity29 will work			1
' i 'm not an out - and - out classic centre			0
what we will try to do is get some organisation to hopefully give a couple of options			0
i 'll obviously be playing one pass out , but i 'll still be playing the same way , ' @entity0 said			2
' i do n't think i 'll pipe down , it 'll be a different way of talking , more about feeding information in			0
' it will be more about giving @entity2 options and there will be times where i 'm sure we 'll swap around			0
we can afford to interchange like that			0
' starting xv : @entity135 ( @entity136 ) , @entity137 ( @entity90 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , @entity0 ( @entity52 ) , @entity27 ( @entity138 ) , @entity2 ( @entity90 ) , @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , @entity141 ( @entity136 ) , @entity142 ( @entity90 ) , @entity143 ( @entity90 ) , @entity144 ( @entity90 ) , @entity145 ( @entity146 ) , @entity147 ( @entity148 ) , @entity149 ( @entity136 , capt ) , @entity150 ( @entity138 )			1

@entity0 and @entity2 will start their first match together against @entity7 at @entity26
@entity90 fly half @entity29 will call attacking plays and has *assumed* goalkicking duties for saturday 's clash
former @entity5 scrum - halves @entity98 and @entity100 have questioned @entity11 's midfield selection
