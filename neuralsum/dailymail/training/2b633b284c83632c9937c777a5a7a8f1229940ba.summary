by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 11 april 2013 @entity2 : 18:04 est , 11 april 2013 @entity3 warned @entity4 must not return to the comfort of the 1980s , opposing everything but offering no leadership @entity8 was embroiled in a damaging row with @entity3 yesterday over his kneejerk resistance to austerity and welfare cuts			1
the former prime minister warned mr @entity8 he risked reducing @entity4 to a party of protest , out of touch with mainstream opinion			1
mr @entity3 insisted the @entity19 ’s belief that the centre ground of @entity22 politics has shifted to the left in the wake of the financial crisis was a fantasy			2
in his most significant intervention in domestic politics since leaving @entity29 , he said @entity4 must get out of ‘ the comfort zone ’ , and that people wanted a party that offered answers to problems rather than merely being a mouthpiece for anger			1
he also suggested mr @entity8 needed to be more realistic on issues such as the spiralling housing benefit bill , spending cuts and education reforms			1
he was backed by former home secretary @entity41 and former business minister @entity42			0
mr @entity8 , however , suggested he regarded the former prime minister , who won three general elections , as yesterday ’s man , insisting he was not interested in ‘ old solutions ’			2
mr @entity3 ’s intervention comes as mr @entity8 faces growing unrest from a section of his party over his refusal to back any of the government ’s attempts to rein in the bloated welfare budget			1
he has previously been circumspect about criticising mr @entity8 , but hit out in an article for the left - leaning @entity56 magazine			2
mr @entity3 insisted that ‘ the financial crisis has not brought a decisive shift to the @entity59 ’ and warned that politics was returning to that of the 1980s – with the @entity62 offering fiscal responsibility and @entity4 simply opposing austerity measures			1
@entity4 must not become simply a ‘ repository for people ’s anger ’ , the former prime minister wrote			0
‘ parts of the political landscape that had been cast in shadow for some years , at least under @entity4 and the first years of coalition government , are illuminated in sharp relief			0
in an extraordinary move @entity4 leader @entity8 , pictured this week launching his local election campaign , dismissed the intervention from mr @entity3 insisting the party had to ' move on ' ‘ the @entity77 is back clothing itself in the mantle of fiscal responsibility , buttressed by moves against “ benefit scroungers ” , immigrants squeezing out @entity22 workers and – of course – @entity4 profligacy			1
‘ the @entity88 is back as the party opposing “ @entity77 cuts ” , highlighting the cruel consequences of the conservative policies on welfare and representing the disadvantaged and vulnerable			0
’ mr @entity3 said the scenario was more ‘ menacing ’ for his party than for the @entity62			0
‘ they are now going to inspire loathing on the @entity59			0
but they ’re used to that , ’ he said			0
mr @entity3 's article will be seen as a damning criticism of the leadership during the 1980s of @entity103 , who has been a strong backer of mr @entity8 ‘ they ’re back on the old territory of harsh reality , tough decisions , piercing the supposed veil of idealistic fantasy that prevents the @entity59 from governing sensibly ... ‘ for @entity4 , the opposite is true			1
this scenario is more menacing than it seems			0
’ in an apparent swipe at mr @entity8 ’s policy vacuum , mr @entity3 warned the public wanted to ‘ know where we ’re coming from because that is a clue as to where we would go , if elected ’			1
mr @entity8 insisted : ‘ i always take @entity3 very , very seriously , but ... i am leading in my own way			2
political parties have to move forwards not backwards , not going back to old solutions			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ it is by challenging old ways of doing things , showing we have understood what we did right and wrong during our time in office , that @entity130 will win back people ’s trust			2
’ however , mr @entity41 said : ‘ he [ mr @entity3 ] is right to remind us that the pendulum did not swing leftwards and there is much to do			0
’ mr @entity42 said : ‘ advice from a three - times election - winning prime minister should always be taken seriously			0
’ @entity77 chairman @entity138 said : ‘ @entity3 is right to warn that @entity4 are n’t a credible party of government under @entity8			1
' the only plan @entity4 have is more of what got us into this mess in the first place – more spending , more borrowing and more debt			2

@entity3 issues stark warning against retreating to 1980s comfort zone
@entity4 ' must not tack right on immigration and left on *tax* and spending '
but @entity8 's office say it is time to ' move on ' from @entity3 's ' mistakes '
