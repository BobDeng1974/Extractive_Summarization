@entity0 will return to the @entity1 but not on @entity2 - even though bosses still have n't found his replacement			1
@entity6 boss @entity5 , who has been tasked with finding a new presenter for the show , said @entity0 ' will be back ' on the @entity1 , despite his very public sacking from @entity2 just last month			1
speaking today about the show 's future , the executive insisted there was ' no ban on @entity0 being on the @entity1 ' and that the 54 - year - old would return to the corporation once he had ' had some time '			1
she said : ' @entity0 will be back on the @entity1			1
it 's serious and unfortunate what happened but there is no ban on @entity0 being on the @entity1			1
' it 's a a big deal what happened and @entity0 , as any human being would , needs some time			2
' earlier this month , @entity0 pulled out of his planned appearance hosting @entity1 satirical show @entity40 , which was due to be filmed this week , and aired a day later			1
it would have marked his first @entity1 appearance since the fracas which led to his departure			2
referring to that decision , ms @entity5 said : ' the @entity1 was prepared to have him on have i got news for you , it was n't the @entity1 's decision not to go ahead with that particular show			1
' she confirmed that the scenes filmed before @entity0 's sacking were likely to air this summer , saying : ' no way would i want the available material not to be seen by viewers			1
' @entity5 refused to say who would be replacing @entity0			2
asked if it would be a woman , she said female candidates were being considered the channel boss also admitted that she had not yet found anyone to fill @entity0 's shoes on @entity2			1
amid growing pressure for a woman to be appointed as the lead host , she added that she not thinking of his replacement ' in terms of gender '			0
she said : ' i worked a lot with female presenters and when i used to work in science that was something across the piece that i really wanted to tackle , but i do n't think i 've ever approached an individual show thinking that was the way i want to cast it , so i think it 's an open book on that			0
' we 'll definitely look at some women , but it 's not a driving priority			0
' she added that the process of reinventing the show without its main star was ' creatively exciting '			0
@entity0 was suspended by the @entity1 last month during an internal investigation after he attacked @entity2 producer mr @entity89 , splitting his lip and verbally abusing him			1
@entity0 's contract was not renewed , with director - general @entity92 saying ' a line has been crossed ' and ' there can not be one rule for one and one rule for another '			1
but the broadcasting veteran received widespread public support , including from friend @entity100			0
@entity0 has said he is already thinking about his next television project			2
he wrote in his column for the @entity103 : ' i have lost my baby but i shall create another			0
' i do n't know who the other parent will be or what the baby will look like , but i can not sit around any more organising my photograph album			0
' @entity0 also revealed he was told he ' probably ' had cancer two days before the ' fracas ' with mr @entity89 , although he has since been given the all - clear			0
he said he considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall - out from the incident			0
@entity0 was suspended by the @entity1 last month after hitting a producer in a row at a hotel , before being told his contract would not be renewed by the corporation ( pictured , in @entity122 earlier this month ) he told the @entity103 : ' let 's stop being silly and pick up the pieces and start again ... i just know i 'm going to do another car show			1
' earlier this month , @entity126 said @entity0 would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel			0
@entity0 first appeared on @entity2 in 1988 , just after @entity131 quit as lead host , rising through the ranks before leaving the show temporarily in 2001 during a ratings slump			2
when the show relaunched in 2002 , @entity0 had rejoined the programme as head presenter , alongside @entity139 and @entity140 - who was replaced by @entity141 in series two			0
the new studio - style format saw the show become the most watched programme on @entity6 , and has been voted the best show on @entity149 television			0
@entity0 's brash presenting style , that often flirted with the boundaries of good taste , earned him legions of admirers and critics , and controversy was never far behind			2
he was censured by @entity1 bosses in 2014 after apparently using the n - word on television while reciting a nursery rhyme , and caused a stir a few months later after the top gear team were attacked while filming in @entity162			0
locals had taken offence to a numberplate on @entity0 's car which read ' @entity167 ' - thought to be a reference to the @entity169 .			2

@entity6 's @entity5 says @entity0 ' will be back ' because there is ' no ban on @entity0 being on the @entity1 '
she insisted he would return in the future but currently ' needs some time '
also said @entity2 scenes filmed before sacking would be aired in summer
ms @entity5 said females were being considered to take @entity0 's post
