@entity0 have stunned their supporters by signing @entity3 defender @entity2 on loan for the remainder of the season			1
the 21 - year - old has made just one appearance for @entity10 's side this season , playing 51 minutes in the @entity13 ' 4 - 2 defeat by @entity14			1
@entity2 , who was on loan at @entity16 for three months earlier in the season , will join @entity0 's under 21 side until june			1
@entity0 have stunned their supporters by signing @entity3 defender @entity2 on loan he made his @entity3 debut at the tail end of last season - playing in the final three games of the campaign - with a late substitute appearance in a 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity25			1
further cameos followed in a 3 - 1 win at @entity28 and a home draw with @entity30			0
it means @entity32 has played 85 minutes of @entity34 football although he was a regular for @entity16 between october last year and january			0
he scored one goal - in a 3 - 2 win at @entity37 - in 15 games , as part of the deal , 19 - year - old midfielder @entity39 will move the other way @entity2 is thought to have been brought in due to a lack of numbers in the @entity47 giants ' youth team after numerous players were sent out on loan			1
as part of the deal , 19 - year - old midfielder @entity39 will move the other way			1
with rumours of @entity53 joining from @entity54 , it 's safe to say the defensive signing is not quite what @entity0 's fans were hoping for on transfer deadline day			1
when @entity61 reported the signing on @entity64 coverage , @entity60 went into meltdown			0
surely this was some mistake ? this was not a @entity53 or a @entity68			0
across the country , bemused @entity0 fans rewound their tvs and wnt straight to @entity73			1
sure enough , abut half an hour after the deadline came confirmation via a tweet from @entity0 's official account to their 4.35m followers			1
the club had brought in @entity2 on loan for the rest of the season with under 21 right back @entity39 going the other way			1
but why ? it 's a good question			0
some would wonder about the logic behind sending one of your own players out on loan and bringing another in on loan			2
but there is method in the madness			0
@entity0 are keen to get as many of their own youngsters out into the big bad world of men 's football			1
they want them toughened up and introduced to a level of aggression rarely seen in the under 21 league			0
officials will hope @entity39 's footballing education will be furthered in the @entity34			1
departures like this , however , leave their own under 21 side short of numbers			0
manager @entity107 is known to believe that there are many unearthed gems in the lower leagues			0
he is known as a coach who sees things in players that others do not			0
this would appear to be the case with @entity2			2
so what 's his pedigree ? he 's @entity3 - born , 21 and a left back			1
a product of the club 's academy he has made four first - team appearances and earned a loan move to @entity16 in october			2
while at the @entity126 side he scored a wonder goal at @entity128 and was described as a solid performer by fans			0
how did the move come about ? @entity0 had to fight off interest from @entity16 ( not a sentence you often write ) to bring him to @entity135			2
the @entity136 spoke to first - team coach @entity137 who relayed the amusing moment when the news was broken to the youngster			0
' sit down , ' he said , before adding that they had some ' good news and bad news '			0
@entity2 opted for the bad news and was told he was not going to @entity145			2
presumably fearing the worst he tentatively enquired as to what the good news was			0
' you 're going to @entity0 , ' was the response			2
what can we expect ? in an interview with fans site @entity3 , @entity2 says he models himself on @entity155 and likes to get forward when he can and play on the wing			1
former wanderers boss @entity157 was impressed and made him the first @entity3 - born youth product to start for the club in eight years after he overcame what the @entity160 described as off - the - field attitude issues			2
@entity163 has seen him in action and is impressed , and with @entity166 's history of giving youth a chance , who knows what will happen next ?			0

@entity0 have signed @entity2 from @entity3

he is @entity0 's third new arrival after @entity182 and @entity183
