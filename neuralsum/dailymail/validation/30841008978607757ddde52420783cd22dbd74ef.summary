heart disease kills one in every six men and one in every 10 women in the @entity4 do n’t put it off because you ca n’t see it			1
take a moment to consider your heart - the most precious of muscles			2
cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people in 2012 - that 's 30 per cent of all deaths			1
that ’s enough to send your heart rate rocketing to a dangerous level – but the good news is there 's a lot you can do to keep healthy			2
when it comes to keeping your heart in tip - top condition , there are some factors such as genetics that you ca n’t change			0
if you have a family history of heart disease , then you are at increased risk yourself			1
however , there is plenty you can do to decrease your risk whether you have a family tendency or not			0
here are some simple changes you can start making today to reduce your risk of heart problems in the future ... ditch the fat - free diet you have probably been advised to cut out saturated fats and replace butter with unsaturated fat spreads			1
this is because a diet high in saturated fats is thought to be one factor that leads to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood ... which in turn may cause narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks			0
however , there is now some controversy as to whether these dietary changes make much difference to your risk of heart disease			1
a recent overview of multiple studies found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease			1
the jury is still out on this one , and it should n’t be used as an excuse to eat high fat doughnuts , pastries , chips and other sources of processed , saturated fat			0
however , butter , cheese and cream in small quantities may not be the complete villains they were thought to be			0
much - maligned butter may not be the dietary villain we once thought , says dr @entity86 know your waist - to - hip ratio the association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong			1
not least because obesity puts you at risk of type 2 diabetes which , in itself , increases the risk of heart disease and multiple other conditions			1
if you carry more weight around your waist than your hips you are even more at risk			0
to calculate your waist to hip ratio , divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement			0
a high ratio ( over 0.85 for women or one for men ) means increased risk of health problems such as heart attacks , high blood pressure or diabetes … even if you are n’t that overweight			0
dr @entity86 reveals her top tips to help people keep their hearts healthy			1
she notes the association between heart disease and being overweight is ' extremely strong ' , urging people to watch their waistlines realise it 's never too late to get active do n’t despair if you are a couch potato – it ’s never too late to start			1
as well as helping with that weight loss , a recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefits if starting exercise such as running or cycling after 40 , as you would have done if you had started before the age of 30			0
there are numerous other benefits from exercise too … what are you waiting for ? say bye bye to the bacon and processed meat , to boost your heart health , dr @entity137 @entity138 ... reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown that eating a large amount can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent			1
however , recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed ( we ’re talking ham , salami , sausages , bacon etc ) – with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat			2
the researchers calculated that for each 50g of processed meat eaten per day ( about one or two extra slices of ham ) the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by 38 per cent			1
these results require confirmation with further studies but as processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too , it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible			2
... and @entity169 the @entity170 is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life			1
adults should have less than 6 grams ( 1 teaspoon ) a day			0
cutting back on salt does n’t just mean keeping your hands away from the salt cellar when you are eating … there is also a lot of hidden salt in processed food			2
check the labels and cook from scratch wherever possible – then you are in control			0
say no to sugar a large population study in the @entity190 showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease			1
that was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar , independent of other risk factors including weight			0
more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too , and as it offers no nutrients whatsoever			0
it is time to cut back			2
gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drinks , avoid fizzy drinks and look carefully at labels – you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sorts of food , both sweet and savoury			2
a large study in the @entity190 revealed people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease stress less while you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy , do n’t let it stress you out - as stress does n’t help your heart either			1
the stress hormone ‘ cortisol ’ can increase unhealthy fat around the middle , raising your risk of heart problems , as well as leading to cravings for high fat and sugar foods , which only make things worse			2
bin the fags the obvious one is to stop smoking			0
smokers die 10 years earlier than non-smokers as shown in a study of one million @entity4 women published last year			0
if you can stop smoking before you are 40 , you are 10 times less likely to have health problems than if you continue			0
as well as benefiting your heart , you will see rapid improvements in your breathing , mood and reduce your risk of stroke , diabetes , cancer , circulation problems and numerous other problems			2
so , for a healthy and happy heart , start making a few small changes today – your heart will love you forever			0
