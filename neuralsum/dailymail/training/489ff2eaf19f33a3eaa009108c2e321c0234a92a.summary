@entity1 paramedics are being flown to the @entity2 to fill staff shortages despite the fact the industry is crying out for more ambulance workers locally			1
the @entity7 has 175 @entity1 starting work this month in an attempt to fill staffing gaps			1
but unions in @entity1 say the industry needs more funding to create more jobs so @entity1 paramedics are not seeing overseas as a more attractive option			1
@entity30 secretary @entity29 said in @entity32 ambulances do n't have enough resources to cover the work they need to undertake			2
' unfortunately delays in ambulance response are becoming more common and it comes down to a system - wide lack of resources , ' he said			2
' the ministry wo n't approve staff increases			2
losing 175 paramedics to fill a shortfall overseas does n't make our situation worse it just does n't help us			2
six of @entity49 's ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including @entity1 , @entity51 and @entity52 ( file picture ) ' what happens here is we need hundreds more paramedics but we do n't have approval or funding for those positions			1
' the @entity1 paramedics - many of them recent graduates - will work 37.5 hours a week and be paid a salary of between £ 30,295 ( $ @entity63 , 753 ) and £ 39,061 ( $ a74 , 396 ) - 25 and 60 per cent more than they earn in @entity1			1
they also received relocation costs and a three - week training course on working in @entity67 , including dealing with incidents on the @entity69			0
@entity70 , assistant secretary of the @entity72 chapter of @entity73 , said local graduates were paid a base rate of about $ 46,000 and work minimum 48 - hour weeks			2
' paramedics in @entity1 are very highly trained and are probably looking at other countries where they can practice their skills internationally , and of course they 'll look at the wage rates , ' mr @entity70 said			1
' but whether they 're going to @entity49 or the @entity83 or leaving the industry altogether the key issue is what 's making paramedics leave @entity1 , and that 's got to be dealt with in every state			1
' a lot of them are only lasting in the job five years and that 's because of burn out - a lot of the time they become so fatigued and are under enormous stress			0
' the issue of staffing shortages for @entity1 ambulances was highly publicised last year when there was a significant delay in paramedics reaching cricketer @entity27 @entity27 , seen here on a stretcher at the @entity106 , later died from severe head injuries @entity7 bosses travelled to @entity1 and @entity109 last year , employing three quarters of the 200 graduates they interviewed			1
they will return there in march for another 280 interviews			0
six of @entity49 's ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including @entity1 , @entity51 and @entity52 , according to figures gathered by the @entity117			1
in total , 183 paramedics have been brought in from overseas since april , compared with just one in the previous financial year			0
@entity122 , from @entity123 , said the fact @entity67 was the busiest ambulance service in the world , receiving up to 5,000 calls a day , was what attracted him			0
he told @entity129 : ' that 's what you look for as a graduate			0
you want to use your skills you 've spent three years at university learning			0
it 's the unknown that attracts you here			0
' another new recruit from @entity123 , @entity138 , told the programme : ' i do n't have plans to go back home because the career advancement is too good			0
' an @entity7 spokesman said it targeted @entity1 because ' their skills and training closely match those in the @entity2 '			1
staff shortages have been blamed on a lack of training places and paramedics being ' actively recruited ' to the @entity154 service or as disability benefits assessors			0
@entity156 , of the union @entity157 , said pressure on existing staff was driving more to leave their jobs			0
yesterday the @entity162 was in talks to avert a 12 - hour strike by ambulance staff on thursday .			2

@entity7 has 175 @entity1 starting work this month
six of @entity49 's ten ambulance trusts plan to recruit staff from abroad
but the industry in @entity1 is crying out for more workers and funding
