@entity1 legend @entity0 has accused @entity3 striker @entity2 of disrespecting the @entity5 club by claiming he fancies a hat - trick in this weekend ’s @entity8 showdown			1
last month , the @entity10 striker said he hoped to become the first @entity12 player to score a treble against @entity1 since @entity14 in 1973 when the clubs meet in the @entity16 semi-final at @entity18 on sunday			1
but @entity0 said the public pronouncement by the on - loan @entity21 man - who has not scored since november - showed a lack of respect towards the club he managed to 10 league titles during two spells at the helm in @entity30			1
@entity0 also believes his comments give @entity1 a better chance of causing a shock			1
@entity2 ( centre ) claimed he fancied scoring a hat - trick for @entity3 against @entity1 in the @entity8 @entity1 legend @entity0 ( centre ) believes @entity2 disrespected @entity3 's @entity8 rivals ‘ you ’ve got to have an overall respect for the teams you play against , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity1 will have a respect for @entity3			1
i ’m not so sure @entity3 are showing the same respect , with some of the comments their players are making			2
one of them ’s talking about scoring a hat - trick			1
‘ a few years ago , the games would have been much tighter in terms of how everybody ’s perception of how the game is going to be			0
but i do n’t think you can turn round and disrespect your opponents by saying you ’re going to score three			0
‘ if that is an overall feeling that @entity3 have got , then it gives @entity1 probably a better opportunity than maybe they should have			1
’ rangers trail @entity56 by 13 points in the @entity58 while @entity3 are top of the @entity60 by three points with a game in hand over @entity64			2
despite the constant chaos on and off the park - with @entity67 resigning and @entity68 handing his own notice in last week - @entity0 insists @entity1 can upset the ‘ overwhelming favourites ’			1
@entity2 , reacting after missing a chance vs @entity72 in december , has failed to score since november ‘ of course they can , ’ he told @entity73 on thursday			2
‘ their results this season , some have been indifferent , but in the three cup games against @entity80 teams , they ’ve won these games			0
and i do n’t think @entity3 are as good now as they were a couple of seasons ago			2
’ meanwhile , @entity83 have backed down and given @entity1 an allocation of away tickets to sell for next month ’s league meeting between the sides after being reassured over the @entity5 club ’s financial predicament			2
after it emerged this week that @entity91 ’s @entity90 would be providing £ 10million of funding to the cash - strapped @entity30 outfit , @entity83 have had a change of heart over the arrangements surrounding the february 20 encounter			0
the @entity100 club had initially taken the unusual step of selling briefs direct to @entity1 fans , with the move stemming from concerns over the @entity5 club ’s ability to reimburse @entity83 the ticket money had they handled the sale			0
@entity2 , celebrating scoring a hat - trick against @entity112 in october , is confident for the @entity1 clash however , following an angry response to the move and the latest cash injection at @entity5 , the @entity115 outfit have handed over a reduced allocation to @entity1 , whilst continuing to sell tickets themselves			1
@entity120 , @entity83 ’ chief executive , explained : ‘ we have reached a compromise with @entity1 following developments this week			0
‘ the temporary funding situation has improved so we have given them a smaller - than - normal allocation			0
‘ we took the view , quite simply , that we needed to do what we considered to be right in order to protect our own position			0
‘ we had to limit any risk of our own finances being affected by the on - going difficulties at @entity5			0
’ @entity2 , on loan from @entity21 , celebrates setting up a goal for @entity136			0
