a group of university professors recently unveiled a scanner they believe can detect the perfect job for anyone - simply by looking at their fingerprints			1

a group of university professors recently unveiled a fingerprint technology that they believe can detect the perfect job for anyone - simply by looking at their fingerprints the new biometric test was used at a careers convention in @entity23 , a city in southwestern @entity2			1
to use the scanner , people place their fingers upon the fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors reads back what sort of work would suit the individual			2
the device bases its results on a database of how fingerprint shapes correlate to job selection			1
this database was created using a variety of previous employment studies			2
local employers linked up with researchers from the city 's @entity43 and @entity45 to road test the technology			1
twenty one - year - old @entity48 , a mathematics graduate , said : ' i got the feedback that i would be suited to a job in @entity52 - which is exactly what i want to do			0
while the science remains in contention , the group claim that in the future , fingerprints could help reveal key personality traits			1
@entity60 , who faints at the sight of blood , said : ' i want to be an interior designer but the machine said i should be a nurse so , no , i do n't think it is as clever as is being made out ' fingerprint identification , known as dactyloscopy , or hand print identification , is the process of comparing two instances of friction ridge skin impressions from human fingers			0

despite its widespread use in crime detection , it is still a science that has a lot of potential , say experts , from detecting drug abuse to personality analysis - exactly as palm readers have been claiming to do for centuries			1

people placed their fingers upon the fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors read back what sort of work would best suit each individual ' the basic concept is that although everybody 's fingerprints are completely unique , there are obvious characteristics that were common on the fingers of certain professionals working in certain jobs , ’ said researcher @entity146			2
‘ it 's not really a new concept because palm readers have been saying for hundreds of years that you can predict a person 's future by reading their palm			2
‘ we want to match that by looking at fingerprints and trying to predict what career path people would choose			2
‘ in a way it 's also kind of like predicting the future , and we are now testing it out by trying to give people advice on what their fingerprints say is in store for them			1
' while @entity2 scientists are focusing on finding a link between fingerprints and personality , the idea that the shape of hands indicates different traits has long been studied by researchers			1
for instance , scientists have noticed an extraordinary link between the ratio of two digits on the hand — the ring and index fingers , known in scientists ’ jargon as @entity188 and @entity189 — and a whole host of seemingly unrelated traits			2
evidence is growing that this ‘ digit ratio ’ , especially when applied to the right hand , is a fundamental indicator of sexuality , aggression and ­ diseases suffered by men			0
a number of years ago evidence emerged of a link between the ‘ @entity203 ’ and a man ’s likelihood of developing prostate cancer			0
specifically , men whose index fingers are longer than their ring fingers were significantly less likely to develop the disease , according to scientists at the @entity212			0
a long index finger also correlates strongly with a lower risk of early heart disease and , in women , a higher risk of breast cancer and greater fertility			0
people with relatively long index fingers are also more likely to suffer from schizophrenia , allergies , eczema and hay fever			0
young boys are more likely to be clingy and anxious than their low - ratio peers but also , ultimately , less attention - seeking and better behaved in school , research claims .			0

device was created by @entity43 and @entity45
it was recently tested at a careers convention in @entity23 , @entity2
while the science remains in contention , the group claim that in the future , fingerprints could help reveal key personality traits
