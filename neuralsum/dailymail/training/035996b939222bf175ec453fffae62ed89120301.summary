two pilots in a helium - filled balloon landed safely off the coast of @entity3 early saturday after an audacious , nearly 7,000 - mile - long trip across the @entity5 that shattered two long - standing records for ballooning			1
the pilots landed four miles offshore in @entity9 about 300 miles north of the popular beach destination of @entity11 , greeted by a team of balloon enthusiasts who assisted with the landing			1
the pilots came in low and dropped thick trailing ropes into the ocean to help slow the balloon before setting down in a controlled water landing			1
the balloon will be towed to the coast			2
mission control in @entity29 was packed with balloon team members and the pilots ' families as it descended , with all eyes focused on a giant screen showing a map of the coast and the balloon 's location			1
they exchanged hugs and smiled with relief after it touched down ' we 're really pleased with the distance numbers we have here and very pleased with the duration numbers , ' said @entity47 , mission control director			2
' these are significant improvements over the existing records			0
we did n't break them by just a little bit			0
they were broken by a significant amount			0
' @entity24 of @entity29 and @entity25 of @entity26 lifted off from @entity27 sunday morning , and by friday , they beat what 's considered the ' holy grail ' of ballooning achievements , the 137 - hour duration record set in 1978 by the @entity61 crew of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 in the first balloon flight across the @entity66			1
they also easily exceeded the distance record of 5,209 miles set by the @entity61 v team during the first trans - @entity5 flight in 1981			1
the pilots were said to be in good spirits at various times during the trip , but it was a grueling ordeal			2
the balloon 's capsule is about the size of a large tent â€” 7 feet long , 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall			2
they were flying at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet , requiring them to wear oxygen masks and bundle up against the 50 - degree temperature inside the capsule			0
they had sleeping bags , a small onboard heater and a simple toilet			0
audacious : the pilots , dubbed the two eagles , have surpassed the world distance record for a flight in a helium balloon after crossing the @entity5 , according to their team adapting : they had been aiming to land in @entity99 or the @entity100 but unexpected weather forced them to change course and they have now landed in @entity9 , @entity3 teamwork : the pair , who have been equipped with cold weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater , are suspended beneath the balloon in a tiny , cramped capsule the original route took the pilots on a path from @entity27 , across the @entity5 and toward the @entity115 before they encountered shifting weather patterns			1
they then made a sweeping right turn and headed south along the @entity9 coast for the @entity3 landing			1
by saturday morning , the @entity121 team had smashed the records , having traveled 6,646 miles over six days , 16 hours and 37 minutes			1
' the technology has improved so much in the last couple of years			0
i do n't think there 's going to be any question about the records , ' said @entity129 , a regional director with the nonprofit @entity130			0
the world has been tracking their progress online and through social media sites			0
still , the official distance and time of the @entity121 flight must be confirmed by the @entity137 , which requires staying aloft 1 percent longer and farther than the previous record			1
the balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments that are tracking its course and compiling the data , using technology that did n't exist in decades past , leaving some claims unproven			2
the journey has been tough on the pilots , who have been on oxygen for days ; high altitude can take a physical toll			0
but they 've been managing to crack jokes when checking in with mission control and their families			0
before the landing , though , the team was all business			0
' right now we have a big job ahead of us to get this balloon down , ' @entity161 said			0
mission : dubbed the ' @entity121 ' , they rocketed past the distance record of 5,209 miles ( 8,383 km ) for human flight in a gas balloon on thursday , which was set in 1981 aircraft : the pilots are also trying to break the flight duration record of 137 hours , five minutes and 50 seconds , set in 1978 high aspirations : @entity24 and @entity25 should pass the existing duration record at about 3.50pm gmt after staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes an emotional journey : @entity177 hugs her daughter , @entity179 , moments after watching her husband , the @entity121 balloon pilot @entity24 , and fellow pilot @entity25 surpass a gas ballooning distance record on a giant screen inside the mission control room logistics : the team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there 's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down operations : when the pilots eclipsed the distance record , a round of applause broke out in the mission control room at the @entity199 in @entity3 getting ready : a network of balloonist volunteers , pictured preparing the @entity121 ' balloon for travel , has been established across the @entity100 who are ready to travel within a 200 - mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear			1
