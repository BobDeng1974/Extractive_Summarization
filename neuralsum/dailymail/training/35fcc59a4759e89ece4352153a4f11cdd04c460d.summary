for nearly three decades the @entity0 divided a city , splitting the communist east from the western capitalist enclave deep inside @entity4			1
built by the @entity4 , or @entity4 , in 1961 , the wall cut off @entity6 from the east , and stopped @entity4 leaving for the @entity8 , or @entity8 , and other @entity10 countries			1
now , almost 25 years to the day since the wall fell on november 9 , 1989 , the @entity4 capital 's appearance has changed dramatically , with the widely - hated structure replaced by modern buildings and bustling streets			1
@entity4 disappeared less than a year later when the country was reunited , and although a few sections of the wall remain at their original sites , as does the famous ' @entity23 ' , most of it was quickly pulled down with demolition carried out between the summer of 1990 and 1992			0
a quarter of a century on , the city is almost unrecognisable , as this gallery comparing images of the @entity0 when it stood with the same locations in the reunified @entity4 capital today shows			2
the top picture shows people dancing on the wall at the @entity40 in @entity6 the day after the ruling , while the bottom image shows how the landmark looks 25 years on bustling : the @entity0 was built by @entity4 in 1961 , and the top image shows the wall around the @entity40 on nov 19 , 1961			1
today the same area is filled with cars , buses and people moving freely around the @entity4 capital taste of freedom : @entity54 citizens push through the newly - created passage at @entity56 , where @entity4 border police tore down segments of the wall on november 11 , 1989			1
almost 25 years later people walk over the crossing at @entity56 and @entity62 transformation : in august 1962 ( top ) the @entity64 was empty with the @entity0 cutting it in two			2
today it is a busy public square and traffic intersection , visited by up to 100,000 people a day			0
on july 21 , 1990 , the @entity70 played host to a charity concert organised by @entity74 's @entity73 to commemorate the end of the division between @entity4 and @entity8 attraction : @entity23 was the best - known crossing point along the @entity0 , and is seen here being visited by @entity80 president @entity79 , seen walking past a cordon of saluting servicemen and the sentry post on june 26 , 1963			0
today , the rebuilt checkpoint is a tourist attraction , manned by actors wearing replica uniforms presidential visit : president @entity79 looks out across the @entity0 into @entity4 during his visit on june 26 , 1963			2
now tourists can visit this attraction to get something of a sense of what living with the wall was like construction work at the @entity0 on aug. 13 , 1985 on @entity98 near checkpoint @entity99 and @entity98 oct. 2 , 2014 - 25 years after the fall of the wall			2
( @entity103 photo / @entity104 ) building work : the top image shows @entity4 workers and troops building the wall in front of the historic @entity111 on november 20 , 1961			0
after @entity4 reunification in 1990 , the building - which had fallen into disuse - was the subject of a major renovation by sir @entity116 and now houses the @entity4 parliament peeking over : a child looks out onto the other side of the @entity0 as she climbs a pile of sand at a playground in july 1981			0
cars now park at the same spot in @entity6 's @entity126 district transport : on march 12 , 1971 , anyone wanting to cross the @entity0 had to pass through checkpoints , such as this one at @entity130 , while today people are free to cycle , drive and walk through the area , which has completely transformed similarities : a few of the buildings visible in this photograph of @entity80 president @entity138 looking across the communist wall into @entity4 during his stay in the divided city on february 27 , 1969 are still visible today , while others in the area surrounding @entity143 have been replaced with more modern versions a river runs through it : a woman looks out across the @entity148 at the @entity0 in 1980 , with construction work taking place at the @entity152 hospital in background			1
today a bridge links the two sides of the river , which has a number of modern buildings along its banks memorial : the words ' the wall must fall ' has been scrawled across the @entity0 along @entity56 in the north of @entity6 when the top picture was taken on march 8 , 1973			0
now a memorial marker , made out of metal rods stands at the same spot , where on the night of november 10 , 1989 , the first segments of the @entity0 were knocked down to create a new crossing between @entity4 and @entity6 changing places : the buildings seen in this picture of @entity54 , taken from an observation platform in @entity56 in the @entity6 in 1980 still remain , although they have been painted			0
trams now run along the site where the wall once stood cut off : a group of children play alongside the barbed wire - topped @entity0 at @entity180 near @entity130 in 1968 , where today a man walks over the once - divided street building work : east @entity4 policemen in work dress remove barbed wire from a brick wall while other officers in the background are raising the wall to 15 feet at the border between the @entity193 and @entity194 sector at @entity56 in @entity6 on september 9 , 1961			1
the line where the wall once stood can be seen in the pavement today so near and yet so far : @entity198 wave to their relatives in @entity54 one year after the @entity0 was erected at @entity56 on august 13 , 1962 , where today people cross the busy street freely			0

@entity0 was built by the @entity4 , or @entity4 , in 1961
it cut off capitalist @entity6 from the east , and stopped @entity4 leaving for the @entity206
when the @entity4 *government* *announced* citizens could visit the west , people began to tear down the wall
today , 25 years on , the @entity4 capital 's appearance has changed dramatically
