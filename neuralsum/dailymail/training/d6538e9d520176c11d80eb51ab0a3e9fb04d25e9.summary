by @entity0 the @entity2 final will be viewed in @entity3 as a date with destiny for @entity6 and the @entity3 , but @entity8 ’s demolition of @entity9 in the semi-finals should serve to temper any over-confidence			1
it may just suit @entity3 to start the big match as the underdog			2
any sense that fate would intervene to grant @entity6 the world title he deserves to cap his remarkable career will be replaced by a knowledge that every @entity21 player on the pitch will have to be at his absolute best to counter @entity8 ’s irresistible brand of precision football			2
all set : @entity6 ( centre ) trains alongside @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 on saturday party time : @entity3 fans chant and sing songs as they surround two @entity33 fans on the @entity35 beach even if the @entity38 ’ overall team performance is flawless , there is still the feeling that @entity6 himself will have to show his genius one more time if his side are to win the game			1
‘ @entity51 ’ was kept relatively quiet by the @entity44 in the semi-final , but that was a result of the @entity48 team forsaking much of their own attacking impetus to concentrate on subduing the @entity50			0
@entity8 are unlikely to take such a conservative approach			0
they will surely back their own abilities to overwhelm @entity3 in midfield even if @entity6 is given a little more space than he was against the @entity57			0
with @entity28 pulling up sore after his final training session , he is a major doubt to start the final , and may not appear at all , which is a huge blow for @entity63 ’s side			1
@entity28 was not at his brilliant best throughout the campaign , but he did offer a crucial attacking counterpoint to @entity6			0
@entity67 has done a solid job of replacing the @entity70 man , though he does not quite have the match - winning ability of @entity28			2
doubt : @entity28 is a major doubt for the @entity2 final after pulling up sore after training on saturday all set : @entity78 ( right ) looks on during training on saturday ahead of the final against @entity8 @entity3 ’s other attacking stars have not lived up to their pre-tournament billing as the best offensive unit in the competition			1
@entity27 , @entity84 and @entity85 have not shone with any consistency , though the @entity88 forward was superb against @entity89 in the quarter - finals			0
if they can all finally click at the @entity92 , @entity8 will certainly have their hands full			0
another key to success for @entity3 is @entity63 himself			1
he has proven himself to be an astute manager throughout the @entity2 , displaying a flexibility that several of his more bullish predecessors in the role did not			1
ready for action : @entity3 's @entity84 ( left ) warms up as he gets set for the final on sunday instructions : @entity3 players listen to coach @entity63 ( white cap ) during training in @entity109 though he has worked with a preferred starting @entity110 for almost two years , as the tournament unfolded he was willing to tinker with personnel and tactics as the situation warranted			1
@entity116 , for example , was the player originally tasked with being the supply line to @entity6			0
when he proved too lightweight in midfield , however , @entity63 dropped him for the more energetic @entity119			0
the manager is also more of a pragmatist than the likes of @entity124 , @entity125 or @entity126 , and although the team have not played pretty football in every game , @entity3 fans are more than content to see their side in a final again after 24 years , following so many capitulations at the quarter - final stage or earlier			1
preparations : @entity3 players warm up during their training session at @entity136 on the beach : an @entity3 fan wearing a @entity6 shirt stands on the @entity35 in @entity109 images of hundreds of thousands of joyful @entity21 taking to the 9 de @entity141 in central @entity142 to celebrate each successive victory in the competition indicate how much this tournament means to the country ’s people			2
a win in the final would spark a party for the ages			0
fever pitch : a street vendor sells @entity3 flags in @entity142 as the country prepares for the final			2

@entity3 take on @entity8 in the @entity2 final in @entity109
the @entity33 ' 7 - 1 win over @entity9 in the semi-finals should temper any over-confidence
winger @entity28 is a major doubt to start the final
@entity63 has proven himself to be an astute manager in @entity9
